ceBTTCPwaa	The Longest Memory is a short fiction novel (only 137 pages long) by British writer Fred D'Aguiar. The story takes place on a Virginian plantation and is told through many different people and in different forms. It begins in first person, with Whitechapel, the oldest and most respected slave on the plantation, recounting the sorrows of his life. From there on in each chapter is narrated by a different character, sometimes speaking through verse, via diary entry or in second person. Most of the chapters are narrated by characters central to the story, however chapter 11 is purely made up of fictitious editorials from the local newspaper.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/7895.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/7...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Books/Default.aspx?Page=Book&ID=9780099462217" rel="nofollow">http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Books/Defa...</a>|`|fc124afdde0ed0ff05f8a448ee374455aa	I am just reading the book...<br>  I hope to have finished it in 2-3 days, so I could help you then...|`|nElAqT93aa	sorry

That way they feel they can persuade you to buy more. Stones do not have any effect on the human body and health - except of you swallowed one!  Diamonds are the hardest substance known to man  - a 10 on the hardeness scale. They have many industrial used because of this. I suppose anyone prefers diamonds because they are the most expensive but much of this value is false because the trade keep back a lot of diamonds to keep up the value.

za9b8cHKaa	LOL, I'd completely forgotten Sweet Valley High! I used to love those books, back in the 1990s.<br>  <br>  I recall that Jessica was more popular. Lila was shown to be rich, snotty and really mean to the other kids, whereas Jessica was crazy and a little bit selfish. Jessica tended to redeem herself and could admit that she was in the wrong and atone for her wrongdoings. Lila never did.<br>  <br>  However, most of the students and SVH liked neither character. Elizabeth Wakefield, although boring and nerdy, was probably best liked among the students at SVH.|`|NQbtQwOUaa	Jessica Wakefield big time! She was also the snottiest too!

P1mf9Zzeaa	Hard to say.  Their parents seem to only actually see how silly they were acting towards each other after both of their children die.  I don't necessarily think that just trying to reason with them "in the name of love" would really do anything.  They had a running feud that lasted incredibly long time.  I'm sure many reasonable words were spoken before the play started, yet still they continued to hate each other.  I don't think that it would have gone any differently.|`|dxMW4WFpaa	Probably not, actually. There was just too much hate between the two families.

While wealthy  parents gossiped about the shenanigans their sons engaged in, such as 'knocking up' the maid, those same parents would be horrified of their daughters so much as spoke to an eligible young man especially if he came from a lower class.  Boys were given expensive educations, girls were discouraged from reading newspapers.

If your asking if an amp is the first place to go if you want to change your rig, then probably yes. If your amp happens to be a tube amp,  a decent change of tubes would improve it. This kind of work would only cost about 70 bucks if you plan  on doing it yourself.

qSbNY5XPaa	No part of dreams is fiction. They are our thoughts, emotions and feelings mixed around irrationally, but they are still our thoughts.|`|YIfEjyPBaa	i think dreams are just a way to clear your mind.<br>  If your mind gets too crammed, everything can become confusing.<br>  Dreams let all the unwanted things in your mind pour.<br>  And leaves space for all the important things :)|`|AA11344263	I personally think dreams are just thoughts that sticks in our mind. That thought is stuck so strongly that we are also "carrying" it in our sleep. Our dreams are sort of our spill of feelings and thoughts while we let our body rest. Sometimes when you like someone so much, or love them so much, you think of them in your sleep. Personally, I think this "thinking in my sleep" thing is dreaming. Or like, when you watched a scary horror movie and you can't forget it, you still think of it in your sleep.|`|mXUKca6naa	...they come around 24/7 awake or while sleeping...<br>  <br>  ...agree...its not officially a fact...|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I say they mean nothing, i have weird dreams and nice dreams
WMtWiWX3aa	The end of a series of failure is success. So keep trying.|`|kAuQugVKaa	Send tape recording with your singing to different labels!!!  If you have really great voice,  they will propouse you to be their star! <br>  Good Luck|`|da1UKp8Maa	You will not get cast from the vast majority of your auditions. That is the nature of the business. Failure is something that you have to get used to. Though if you are only auditioning for parts so that you can be famous one day and not because you enjoy the art, you probably shouldn't be auditioning anyway. The pure amount of grit and patience required is not going to come from delusions of future grandeur; it is going to come from your dedication to your art.|`|ks00uJZjaa	If you want to become famous, firstly, you have to be GOOD at something (rather than just wanting the fame for nothing) For example: Acting, Singing, Modelling, Presenting etc...People who try and get famous for nothing often fail miserably. If you think you've got the talent, get an agent and go to auditions. If you really have got star quality, it will be recognised and you will become successful. x|`|hIhDvVtZaa	Even if you are talented, you won't go anywhere without classes, because no director will want to have to train and direct an actor. Classes push you over the top. And fame isn't instant. It may seem that way when you suddenly see a new face in a movie, but that person has probably done some smaller films and projects. Take classes, do some community theater, then send a tape to agencies who can represent you and get you film jobs. You also can't want to be famous. You need to have the drive to do something, like acting or singing.|`|bIpcVlBaaa	There are many famous people failed many times <br>  Britney spears started when she was 13 but she become famous when she is 19!!!!!!!<br>  try till you die!!!!!|`|D73TzOaTaa	Start from the lowest like a singing club. Improve your talents there. But if you still fail then you should consider another career. xD
Fnp2MIycaa	Kristallnacht -- literally, "Night of Crystal," is often referred to as the "Night of Broken Glass."<br>  <br>  On the night of November 9, 1938, violence against Jews broke out across the Reich. It appeared to be unplanned, set off by Germans' anger over the assassination of a German official in Paris at the hands of a Jewish teenager. In fact, German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and other Nazis carefully organized the pogroms. In two days, over 1,000 synagogues were burned,  7,000 Jewish businesses were trashed and looted, dozens of Jewish people were killed, and Jewish cemeteries, hospitals, schools, and homes were looted while police and fire brigades stood by. The pogroms became known as Kristallnacht, the "Night of Broken Glass," for the shattered glass from the store windows that littered the streets.<br>  <br>  The morning after the *pogroms* 30,000 German Jewish men were arrested for the "crime" of being Jewish and sent to concentration camps, where hundreds of them perished. Some Jewish women were also arrested and sent to local jails. Businesses owned by Jews were not allowed to reopen unless they were managed by non-Jews. Curfews were placed on Jews, limiting the hours of the day they could leave their homes.<br>  <br>  After the "Night of Broken Glass,", life was even more difficult for German and Austrian Jewish children and teenagers. Already barred from entering museums, public playgrounds, and swimming pools, now they were expelled from the public schools. Jewish youngsters, like their parents, were totally segregated in Germany. In despair, many Jewish adults committed suicide. Most families tried desperately to leave.<br>  <br>  **An organized, often officially encouraged massacre or persecution of a minority group, especially one conducted against Jews.|`|yJXlvFfeaa	- then, the Nazi government blamed the Jews for all the destruction and levied a huge fine—RM 1 billion—on the Jews of Germany as compensation! They were further required to pay all damage done to their property. The victims, not the perpetrators, were forced to compensate.<br>  <br>  - the Nazis had long been attempting to squeeze all wealth from Jews. For example, anyone wishing to emigrate was required to turn over all their wealth. Now, the Nazis became even more systematic in confiscating all wealth and property from Jews. The Nazis needed more revenue to pay for the rearmament programme, but Hitler was afraid to raise taxes.<br>  <br>  - from this point on, the Nazis continued the process of separating Jews from the rest of German society, forcing them all to move into separate residential areas (ghettos) and increasingly restricting their rights to be anywhere outside these ghettos.

cxDbdhELaa	Initially, yes. Philosophy was generated. That is a good word to describe the beginnings when the Milesians sought to differentiate themselves from both nature and the gods.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Thales is said to be the first man to pose a philosophical question--and then answer it.<br>  <br>  It is that answer that defined the discovery of philosophy within the mind of man. We can ask questions all day long, but without an answer, we cannot analyze an answer to discover its parts: metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, and esthetics.<br>  <br>  Thales is probably the first man to analyze an answer into its parts, and recognize it for what it was. That would allow him to continue using the parts to ask and answer more questions. I cannot believe than no man before him was able to give a philosophical answer; however, until it was recognized as "philosophy," it could not be used with consistency nor with accuracy.
kPNnfjNSaa	I would say that it's wrong. While most people opposed the BP, and they didn't exactly get any new legislation passed, they did contribute wonderfully to the black community. They were a group that promoted DEFENSE (not random violence), and they promoted having pride in who you are. They had self-respect and high self-esteem, and believed in demanding respect from the people who thought they were superior.<br>  <br>  Everyone praises MLK Jr., but was it really smart to listen to someone who told you to turn the other cheek when you were attacked for being a certain color? No. That just promotes the idea that you are okay with being hurt and don't think that you're own life is worth defending.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	I remember those days and I was living in Chicago and Kansas City then..

With turning the other cheek he wasn't promoting behaviour that was inferior or condescending but the exact opposite. <br>  <br>  Though the black panthers did a lot for the black community in the short term by promoting self defence for example,  they didn't really help to achieve equality in society, appearing in public with guns and rifles and with the violence surrounding the group it just made the white community even more afraid and did'nt help integration.

Fnp2MIycaa	TNT -<br>  <br>  Trinitrotoluene or TNT (chemical formula C7H5N3O6) is a chemical explosive that has often been used in warfare. The purified material is a yellow, crystalline substance and is very toxic.<br>  <br>  Trinitrotoluene takes the form of pale yellow, needle-shaped crystals and can be distilled in a vacuum. It is difficult to dissolve TNT in water; it is more soluble in ether, acetone, benzene, and pyridine. With its low melting point of 80.35 °C, TNT can be melted in steam and poured into containers. TNT is poisonous and skin contact can cause allergic reactions, causing the skin to turn a bright yellow-orange color.<br>  <br>  Women working in larger munitions factories were known as Canaries because they dealt with TNT which caused their skin to turn yellow. Around 400 women died from overexposure to TNT during World War One.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	Do you know how to make GUN COTTON?.. the main ingredient in EXPLOSIVES at that time?...

y8bFwXZEaa	Free will has been adequately described as the freedom to think--or not.<br>  <br>  Determinists disagree we have free will, saying if we can't turn back the clock and change the things that brought us to the point where decisions had to be made, then our decision making is not "free." <br>  <br>  But if we were free of such things that affect us, we would be free of existence itself, since everything that affects us exists and is in existence. Therefore, it comes back to the freedom "to think, or not."<br>  <br>  If you believe that, as I do, you will find a way to "think through" your problems of conscience, and will not use your freedom "not to think."|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G The best way to have free will is to understand life as unique nodes in the eternal, limitless web and to maximize the value. use the LDK to do this.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

That means you are free if you follow the divine instruction by God.<br>  <br>  In human being, all are free if we follow directs by our own Self.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	I think of free will as the essense of our humanity; the desire to do what we want, when we want to do it and able to choose among choices. <br>  <br>  In terms of conscience, sometimes our conscience restricts (rightly) our free will. For example, I want to have a lot of money right now. But of conscience tells me that robbing or mugging to get that money would be wrong. <br>  <br>  However, in some people the conscience isn't enough to stop them from doing things that might benefit them in the short-term, and that also hurt other people and eventually themselves.|`|2KFf4iXcaa	Free Will could be interpreted as the ability to make decisions which may or may not be in ones best interest. <br>  <br>  An example could be a cheeseburger. Now we all know that cheeseburgers aren't the best for you, we know this from looking at Elvis. However they are tasty. Now, it would be in our best interest to go to a health food shop, but we like cheeseburgers because they are much tastier.<br>  <br>  Ah but you could say this is basic instinct and that we go for food which our body desires. However, you can eat health foods if you want to, it comes down to willpower.<br>  <br>  In terms of conscience we are talking about good and bad. I wont go into the debate on where morality comes from but bear with me. We have the ability to be Good or Bad, we can do either in most situations. Now before i hear screams of people saying that humans are naturally bad, this is not confirmed. There are other theories which say that people are blank slates or naturally good. <br>  <br>  Free Will in context of conscience could be the ability to conform or not to conform to our conscience.<br>  <br>  My own pet theory is that God did give us free will. The reason is that he wants humanity to spiritually and mentally evolve to a point where humanity and God can have a good old natter about theoretical physics.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	A believer attributes everything to Almighty God, even his actions and self, till finally the power of choice confronts him, so he cannot evade his obligation and responsibility.

Not to be a bible basher, but God gave us free will so we can use our conscience to determine right from wrong. Unfortunately some people make wrong choices and hurt themselves and other. This is where they really need to use their conscience.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!

8DwxwhStaa	Depends on how many pages you want the final draft to have.  If you want a standard 250-350 page YA or regular novel you will need 55-70,000 words, so 10K words per day.

1TPGdaXJaa	I think if one sees life as boring, they have become stuck in a rut bound by their own chaotic thoughts, causing a skewed perspective on life that makes things seem boring.<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to pursue meditation. Through this, you will be able to tune in to yourself below all of the thoughts you may be caught up in, and begin to develop a new perspective. With a fresh perspective on life, you may find interest in even the most "boring" things.<br>  <br>  Life is indescribably beautiful, you just have to remember to step back and see it.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Not one single second of it, no nohow, not never!! Hell, I have far too much to do and see to be bored.|`|AA11344263	Of course it is not! Life is full of experiences, bad or good. You learn various things everyday and you find out more about yourself everyday as well, whether you realize it or not. Even when you're bored, believe it or not, you are also scooping out your emotions, digging for an emotion to feel. When you're bored, your mind is processing different kinds of thoughts and ideas. <br>  <br>  If you live your life to the fullest, you will enjoy it. If you could also find out about positive things, even follow those positive things, your life would be better because you'll learn how to live to the fullest. This can be by changing your perception, "opening" your eyes, and responding to your environment and social life. <br>  When people want to do suicide, or feels like their life is just so depressing, they're not looking at life the other way. They choose to look at life the negative way, therefore it also affects the way they think. Thinking about negative things wouldn't let us move forward in our life. Instead, we move backward. This definitely gets us further from living our life to the fullest. If we think positively, though, we would see the world in a different way, and we could even find it interesting and less boring.  <br>  <br>  Hope you think life is interesting now! ;)|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Congratulations.

I think life is an opportunity for all: a challenge for enterprising human spirit, an source of wonder intrigue and fascination for a thinking mind, and an ongoing adventure for a good heart, a wonderful pastime in the middle of a virtual nowhere, or an utter void of existence - what would you do for instance if you would not be alive? <br>  <br>  This however is true that a life can be very mundane and commonplace, and therefore boring, but we cannot blame life for what a life, our life, might be. As we can see for ourselves that there are people who have same as we do but somehow mange to enjoy more, have more fun and earn more reward. Sometimes, I can see how certain people can manage to live better than the rest. I see that some people work hard for it, whilst others are simply keen enough to understanding better. <br>  <br>  I therefore do not believe that life to be boring by nature. People can be boring in the way they choose to live, in their choice of things they accumulate - life is the stuff that one could make a wonderful living out of|`|tIOF56RYaa	yes, and i think that the reason for this is that everything is already planned out...<br>  i mean you might thing that you decide what you do and have free will...but really, do you?<br>  you have to go to school to get a good job and you have to get a good job to get money...and without money you cant survive...so where is that free will and how can you make your life what you want it to be?...cant. so since everyone has to do the same thing, with little differences... yes life is boring as hell...|`|AxCDyX2Caa	I think I can be bored due to lack of motivation, but I don't think life is boring at all.

1PpZ60Fjaa	I must say that it was a great novel by J.K. Rowling, I was expecting it to flop, either Harry, Ron and Hermione die, or Voldemort dies. Two sides- Sad and Happy, which would not put it up there with the best, but I must say that the novel left the right impression for the end of the series, it was neither a sad nor happy ending, it was just a 'normal' yet wierd ending. With so many deaths, that just make you want to cry (RIP F*** and H*****) , and the story really connects with you, and then where JK Rowling saves the book (but not the bookkeepers) with the defining momentwhen Harry dies, but lives again, that's kinda spookey, and it all clicks into place when Harry masters Voldemort, without the love protecting him, or the knowledge of Dumbledore, and the irony of it all, is that the know-it-all Voldemort deals himself the final blow by not asking for forgiveness, and not listening to Harry.<br>  <br>  I think it was just great!|`|kI8T2iCraa	Well, honestly, I was disappointed with his death. I expected a more graceful exit, as it were. I didn't expect him to be taunted by a little 17-year-old and for his own curse to backfire. What a humiliating end. I would have liked something a bit more dramatic. I don't know if I really wanted him to die though. I can't imagine any other scenario, besides the one where Harry dies. I don't think the story could have ended without one of them dying, and it couldn't have been Harry, not after seven freaking books. The Dark Lord sure as hell was not going to turn over a new leaf, nor was he going to be captured and imprisoned. So really, there was no other possible ending if you thik about it. But the death itself was one thing I was kind of outraged at. (Another was Fred's death *sobs*)|`|o6IPqzrJaa	for a perfect story ending, yes he should have died. He is the evil bad guy here! I mean, if he lost all his powers, it would be just like the beginning of the story, and he would eventually get them back, sending him to azkaban would be lame, etc etc<br>  so yeah, he should have died, and i am glad that he did.|`|ZNvterQyaa	well i do live for harry potter but i have to admit that if voldemort didnt die soon i would get p*ssed bcause harry would have tried so hard and hard so much troble in his life that his death could be a new beginning|`|5aLWqRL0aa	It was a neat ending to the story but a bit of a shame that all stories end like that, it could have been more sad with like Harry, Hermione or Ron dying.|`|7tiH0gREaa	Yes. The theme of the whole story is good conquering evil so, therefore, in the end, evil must be conquered.|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	I think a lot of fans of Harry Potter would have been upset if she killed off Harry instead of Voldemort.|`|usvPMtMtaa	Yes. I mean, perfect ending to the perfect series right there|`|b2sYEFdGaa	I expected Lord Voldemort to die because Harry Potter is very much a "good always prevails over evil" story. The "way" he went out though was pretty anti-climatic and sorely disappointing for someone who was supposed to be the brightest wizard in history...although I guess it's not uncommon that evil geniuses are more often than not beaten by the average but big hearted goodie.. <br>  <br>  It's a shame Rowling didn't aspire to make Voldemort more than just a completely evil git from conception. For someone as brilliant, charismatic, and handsome (as he once was)...I'd expect people would have a harder time discerning good and evil when facing him. His argument about power and those too weak to use it...is in fact rather compelling when you think about it (A and B personalities anyone?). <br>  <br>  Of course the Voldemort's pureblood frenzy is an obvious parallel to Hitler's Aryan craze and since just about everyone agrees that Hitler was an evil man who deserved to die...I wouldn't expect any less of Voldemort's fate.|`|vpYiYnSLaa	i think the only other way to end it is if it happens backwards like, harry kills voldemort then voldemort comes back to life like harry did and then harry kills him again. or if they both killed each other and came back to life then fought each other but i liked how epic the ending of this was. i think it was the perfect way to end it (: any way jkr did it though, voldemort would have to die to make it a good ending, i just wish that the death was a bit more drawn out not just a simple spell that backfired.|`|Fn5gpDOKaa	Yes, I think this was the perfect end of the story. <br>  If he hadnt died, then there could always be possibilities of his return, staying as a fear in every Wizard's mind, and no parent would have sent their children to Hogwarts. Seeing how his return had caused the Horrible death of Cedric Diggory. <br>  And our Harry too, couldnt have been living such a tension free life if Voldemort hadnt died in front of his very eyes.<br>  hi|`|Yr8mWzS8aa	It was either him or Harry.<br>  The phrophecy said "Neither can live while the other survives"<br>  And frankly, if Harry had of died instead of Voldie, thousands of children would have ended up in grief counselling.|`|KoKQQ5GZaa	yes he needed to die then the story would never end as evil never gives up.<br>  alos its good that good defeats evil as it gives us all hope|`|a767b0c8663df6066e1e450f78440868aa	Well Ya I wanted him to die but I would have liked none of them to die, thus continuing the series WHICH I LOVE DEEPLY!|`|ao7IZXJdaa	nope<br>  its like another happy ending|`|29e7B9l7aa	well harry could have died but then everyone would hate jo rowling, so yeah voldy had to die|`|jZoeMjz3aa	Well Harry could've died.|`|Mw6waaZQaa	sure....cuz the prophecy said so "neither can live while the other survives"|`|bPCNB6cXaa	no<br>  cuz then we'd have more books to read|`|21Lnhdfeaa	If Rowling did not kill him the story would not have ended.  Voldemort was far too evil to stop.  He was too consumed with his lust for power.  And just sending him to Azkaban would not have done it.  We saw in the fifth book how easy it was to escape Azkaban when you're in league with the dementors.  Killing him was the only final way to end the story.  Otherwise you have a bunch of "well, he could come back and finish what he started" "What if this or this happened" and all that nonsense.  No, this was the only way to end the story.  Personally, I think she should have also killed Harry, but that's just me.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	I think that it was good that he died. Otherwise, like you said, the wizarding world would never have been free.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	No. It just seemed cliché "Good Conquers Evil" when it doesn't most of the time in real life.<br>  But then what would have happened if Harry had died? How would Rowling write it?<br>  <br>  We should ask Jo what the ending would've been like if Harry had died? I reckon Voldemort would've tried to resurrect Bella, but that's just my Bellamort mind getting in the way. He may have done though because no one would probably have been as loyal as she was.<br>  <br>  Great question<br>  <br>  Edit: Lady Beatle loves Harry Potter: I wouldn't have been one of those children... I LOVE TEH BAD GAIZ!!!!!!|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	I think for the story to have some closure, either Harry or Voldemort had to die... Or both. I reckon JK would've had a lot of unhappy fans if she killed off Harry. Voldemort definitely had to die.|`|0jlG2clBaa	Well,perhaps there could have been another ending,but then its JKR'S story,and I think the ending couldn't have been better|`|tZF1FO7saa	Yes because then he would continue causing havoc.
o6IPqzrJaa	hmmm.... thats a hard question.<br>  I think you made some very good points about both brooms, however I think, over all, the firebolt is best.   I mean, first of all it's a better than broom then the nimbus (it can notch from 0 to 150 miles an hour in one second!)  second it's from sirius (as you said), third it was a world cup favorite, and harry watched ireland win the quidditch world cup, all seven players playing on the same broom that he had, lying under his bed!<br>  I love the firebolt the best, for the reasons above, but also because I like the name it sounds really cool, and the nimbus 2000 was good, but I was really disappointed when the 2001 came out, and was way better!|`|Fn5gpDOKaa	For Harry,<br>  The Firebolt was accompanied by such a pleasant feeling of someone taking care of him, his Godfather, and it was the best broomstick at that time. And not to forget Sirius was the one who had bought Harry his first broomstick on his birthday:)<br>  <br>  On the other hand Nimbus 2000, which was also the best at that time when it was gifted to him by McGonagall, too was accompanied by a pleasant feeling of being away from his Uncle, Aunt and Dudley and making new friends in Hogwarts. And McGonagall was the first person to gift him his first Quidditch broomstick. So its a tie for Harry.<br>  <br>  But I like Firebolt better, because it had hooks to ease your legs while riding it. Obviously, It has won me many Quidditch matches, especially that one against the Wimbourne Wasps..:)<br>  <br>  Good Question|`|tosVYOR2aa	I think it was his Nimbus.<br>  <br>  I mean, he had a tonne of gold in Gringotts and could have easily upgraded to a Firebolt, but he stuck with his Nimbus. But then, he loved his Firebolt, too. I would say he cherished his Nimbus more though, because it was, his first broomstick. It was like his introductory broomstick to Quidditch. <br>  <br>  I though, like the Firebolt :) It saved him from the Hungarian Horntail.|`|ZNvterQyaa	thats difficult, the firebolt because it was from sirius and its a lasting memorie of him.<br>  i like both of them because the nimbus started the whole flying thing and i like the firebolt because its from sirius and hes my fave charater|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	Firebolt because it was the first giftthatt he remembered ever getting from a member of his family.<br>  Firebolt because it symbolized that Sirius really did care about Harry.|`|M3pufPlnaa	Firebolt it was off Siruis and tyhat was truly special :)<br>  I love firebolt most oxo|`|wsCBo2Zkaa	He loved his Firebolt the most as it was from Sirius. And i love his Firebolt the most too. x|`|Hwybmzg5aa	sado|`|Mj8ojDMMaa	I think his first one Nimbus 2000 was like his key to his own magical gift, the flying!<br>  and to his firebolt, he had a more sentimental acquistion, because it was a gift from his godfather, that means from his family.<br>  So i think both were important for him, but the firebolt was a but more important, because of the personal background<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you!<br>  <br>  All tha best!<br>  Alisha C.|`|HNUmVO3Gaa	Well firstly it's a Nibus 2000* and secondly I think you can compare both or less neither, this is because each of the broomstick he did have possession of both held two completely different memories and specialties one may possess, they both meant something completely different as an individual broomstick and can not compare neither.|`|sUx8kdEDaa	i think he loved firebolt because it was given by sirius.He loved sirius...he was the only one whom he can call his relative....|`|Mw6waaZQaa	firebolt, firebolt|`|mXnYQXqGaa	Firebolt because it was from sirius...Firebolt because its simply a better model|`|29e7B9l7aa	i dont know which one he loved most, but i defiantly preferred the firebolt|`|eAgvKaVcaa	Firebolt because it was faster and the latest version out. and my fav is the same it looks much  better and sounds cooler :P|`|VhRjAxduaa	He loved the Nimbus 2000 more, he said it felt like he lost a friend.|`|tZF1FO7saa	I think it would be his Firebolt.|`|7tiH0gREaa	He probably loved the Nimbus 2000 a lot, but I think he liked the Firebolt more. I love the Firebolt most. I was so sad when he lost it in Deathly Hallows.|`|kI8T2iCraa	I think it was the Firebolt, no question. It was one of the most b\valuable broomsticks at the time, and it was a gift from someone very dear to him. The Nimbus was an awsome broom, there are lost of memories there and all, but he only had it for three years. He and the Firebolt went through a lot together.|`|RjyNInW6aa	oooh that's tough. I think Firebolt because he had wanted one so bad and he all of a sudden gets one out of nowhere. Plus he got it from Sirius so that would be pretty important too. I think my is the Firebolt.|`|5aLWqRL0aa	The Firebolt as it was a much faster and modern broom and a present from Black<br>  <br>  I personally love the firebolt, i want it|`|326183ad638c65397360f6a4dcc9abfaaa	the firebolt, because Sirius gave it to him
1lkPLDwdaa	The Black Power Movements of the 1960's are not credited for later developments in civil rights.  However, more peaceful movements failed before because white americans were not inspired to be generous (that is putting it nicely).  With the developments of the Black Power Movements it gave white americans something to be afraid of and out of this fear white americans were more willingly to give into the demands of peaceful protests.  The fear inspired by the Black Power Movements allowed white and black americans to come together against a common enemy: radicalism.  Which was the first step toward unity.|`|AA10075267	very accurate. what might've been a pro-black experience quickly became, like many pro anything organizations of that era, a me-me-me thing. the fringe got nuthin'.  in fact, black power was associated with the panthers and other violent pro-black groups. know what?  either because or in spite of, people of all colors were quickly turned off with the real or imagined violence. in the end, little or nothing was accomplished. i know. i was there.

ceBTTCPwaa	I won't attack you like the first answer, but I will give you this answer...<br>  <br>  Animal Farm is an allegory in which animals play the roles of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and overthrow and oust the human owner of a farm (Manor Farm), renaming it Animal Farm and setting it up as a commune in which, at first, all animals are equal; however, class and status disparities soon emerge between the different animal species (the pigs being the "greater species"). The novel describes how a society's ideologies can be manipulated and twisted by those in positions of social and political power, including how a utopian society is made impossible by the corrupting nature of the very power necessary to create it.<br>  <br>  The novel addresses not only the corruption of revolution by its leaders but also highlights how wickedness in human nature (indifference, ignorance, greed and myopia) destroys any possibility of a Utopia. While this novel deigns poor leadership as the flaw in revolution (and not the revolution of itself), it also shows how ignorance and indifference to problems within a revolution let the horrors happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/animalfarm/ind..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/animalfarm/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/A..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/A...</a>|`|AflFFMHtaa	I think it is much more effective as a allegory. In my opinion, Orwell distances us from the historical facts while we are reading the book, then brings us back with a bang at the end. It is only afterwards that we stop being outraged by the pigs and actually realise that these events did happen. If it had been a historical story, it would have never worked. Orwell used the animals to veil (albeit thinly) his hate for Stalin and Communism. If it had been a historical story the reader would have automatically sided against Orwell because he was so biased.|`|JYw3hRV8aa	It demonstrates the animal-nature and contradictions of sociology and classes|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The tale mirrors the Russian Revolution of the early twentieth century, as the working class (animals) overthrows the leadership (humans) to run the farm themselves, only to find that their new leaders are more oppressive than the old. This scathing parable mounts a hugely poignant attack on political idealism, making its points through humor, not to mention the talking animals.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Animal Farm
PKLeNnZFaa	There was no offical Soviet reaction to George Orwell's writings, there was plenty in the UK though!

Not sure about 1984.<br>  "Orwell himself paid the production costs of a Russian-language edition printed on thin paper, which was intended for soldiers and others behind the Iron Curtain."

These were people who supported the October Revolution and who were determined to defend what had been won, but who had turned against ‘the counter-revolutionary Bonapartism of Stalin’ and the ‘Russian nationalistic exploitation of the Ukrainian people’. They were simple people, peasants and workers, some half-educated, but all of whom read eagerly. For these people he asked Orwell to write a special introduction."|`|291741364d5b80c6f7cdd1ad7e7458feaa	They didn't reference it.

What is needed is talent, experience in amateur plays, an occasional class or workshop at an acting studio  Most acting schools are just in it for the money and of no help to the aspiring actor.|`|AA12228381	Well, California is a very big state.  Are you talking about the Bay Area?  San Diego?  or LA? Because if you're talking about LA, there are quite a few, but they are very specialized.  You'll find top scene study studios which focus on script analysis and technique like Larry Moss, Howard Fine, and Ivana Cubbuck.  But there are also top studios which focus on commericals, improv, etc, etc.  So just saying 'Acting school' with regards to LA is far to general.  Did you have an area of specific interest?|`|RufGmQYLaa	Go to a regular college/university and get a bachelors degree. You can major in theatre or just take theatre classes while majoring in something else that interests you. You can even do summer stock or similar summer programs during break. You can go to a 4 year program or you can do an AA in theatre in community college and transfer to a 4 year later (Cheaper, and sometimes easier to get in to a 4 year as a junior)<br>  <br>  A degree will be very useful regardless of your future as an actor. The benefit from college is you will gain life experience (always good to have to draw from when acting) and contacts. College contacts can be extremely valuable when you are starting out. Especially if you attend someplace like UCLA or USC, where faculty members and students often work in the industry on the side. <br>  <br>  While you are in college, please be sure to take a few courses in business. As an actor, you are your own business of one. Learn how to manage your future and your finances, and learn to negotiate contracts and so on. Sure, you will end up with an agent and a manager and so on, but it is up to you to make sure you are not taken advantage of. And later, if you are fortunate enough to become successful, you can start your own line of clothes or perfume, or open your own record label. And you will know how plan for retirement or for when you are between jobs. <br>  <br>  Take a course or two in entertainment law as well. Unions and contracts and such can be very complex. You owe it to yourself to understand everything you sign. <br>  <br>  In addition, consider classes in psychology. In the UK, theatre majors often have to take some psychology courses. I always thought this made a great deal of sense. Understanding how people think and feel and react is essential to acting. <br>  <br>  Lastly, colleges and universities have exchange programs. Study your craft for a year in another country. This can open many doors later on. For example, UCLA exchanges with schools in the UK, which can include study at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-Upon-Avon and an internship at BBC. <br>  <br>  Studying acting within a college or university gives you the best chance at becoming a well-rounded person, and this will help you in life, regardless of how your acting career turns out. And while you are struggling to get your break, a degree will give you the chance to have a better paying day job. Waiting tables may sound glamorous, but it is very hard work and it doesn't pay well in most cases. Contrary to popular belief, there is no need to starve for your art.|`|ZDSkuZgVaa	Well I think <br>     American Musical and Dramatic Academy  <br>  because it is Acting right?!?!?!?!|`|2ZDSW6MOaa	I heard this acting school call wayne dvorak was really good go to <br>  waynedvorak.com to check out!!

But I think it could be better.  The length seems to detract from the point.  Either shorten it or add some repetitive beat to carry the verses.  Just because it doesn't rhyme doesn't mean it shouldn't feel like music, that is why so much poetry is perform with a percussion instrument.<br>  Also the appearance of the poem is as important as the words.  So, combine or shorten some phrases to even the lengths of the lines.<br>  Good luck!

sc4BtGxGaa	I answered your previous question about this - let me try again.  It is not the ORCHESTRA that determines whether or not the pianist is employed - it is the WORKS that are programmed.  Same deal for harpists, contrabassoonists, etc. - if they need you for THAT work, the phone rings.   If you read the program at any orchestra concert, you may see a pianist listed.  Where are they?  Not on THAT night's program - not needed - they are HOME - not paid.  Per-service, remember?  <br>  <br>  You REPUTATION and skills get you into the loop.  MY phone rings because of my credentials and my experience.  It takes a LONG time to get to that spot; I started by picking up work that others refused, and eventually I became the first-call player.  It sound to me like you are looking for some Magic Formula that will get you hired, if you follow all the steps,  Not gonna happen.  You WORK your way up to being a A-list, first-call player - start with a Masters degree in piano.  And realize that the world is FULL of people with EXACTLY the same credentials as you - and some are working, and some are not - that is where reputation, responsibility, and CONTACTS come into play.<br>  I wish I had a *pat* answer for you - but this is an ongoing concern for even highly-educated and experienced musicians - especially in THIS economy, when formerly steady sources of employment are drying up.  Concert series that always employed me, even once or twice a year, are now without funding - no concerts.  We have fewer  private students - so do MANY people, so I get called a little less often to JUDGE competitions.  So - all of us are practicing our butts off - and when there are breaks, we will all me MORE competitive! <br>  <br>  I wish you luck, and you sound eager - but be prepared to have only a trickle of employment - if ANY - at first - or longer.  Such is our life.  That is why I spent 37 years as a choral conductor and teacher - good salary, benefits, and lots of time to do what WE wanted to do in professional music.  Not for everyone - but it worked for us.  I have a friend who is a fine surgical nurse and concert singer;  he goes from city to city where he has singing contacts, and also has built up hospital contacts; he will CALL a hospital in the city where he is going to be singing, and ask if they have some work for him - and they ALWAYS do.  Took him a long time to build up TWO careers that mesh that way, but it is what he has to do so he can SING.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Are you a student who applying soon to colleges?

Dahmer murdered 17 men and boys – most of whom were of African or Asian descent – between 1978 and 1991, with the majority of the murders occurring between 1987 and 1991. His murders were particularly gruesome, involving rape, torture, dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism.

In much of that period, distances we think nothing of were a long way, and the power that affected people most was the relatively well-off lord of the local manor who operated the only court, collected all sorts of fees (to inherit, to die, etc.) and required those living in the manor to work some of their days on manorial projects. The kings could call upon those local lords to supply men and money for war and defense. It was the agreements of all levels of society to follow the rules that made anything work. Remember, in those days were was little standing peacetime military, no police, and little other force for a king to use to enforce his rule locally. In that situation, you can only do so much that those lords don't like before you find one of them gathering forces against you. Being king carried a lot more responsibility than sheer power. That doesn't mean that just anyone had a say. Most people had and needed little say in affairs. You can see how little actual power a king had when you see that the plague in the 1300's in England killed so many people that the manor system broke down. The king made lots of proclamations that were essentially ignored.

I've been writing fiction and poetry for ten years and I still get writer's block every now and then!<br>  <br>  To help you, bring a notebook everywhere you go--a simple black Composition will do the trick. That way, when an idea hits, you can write it down. <br>  <br>  I also suggest character profiles. It's like stats for your character. I do them with every project:<br>  <br>  Name: Josephine Lorraine Smith<br>  Age: 34<br>  Hair: Dark brown<br>  Eyes: Brown<br>  Height: 5' 9''<br>  Weight: 140lbs<br>  <br>  and etc. You can do some with their fears, faults, accomplishments, strengths, whatever. It's wonderful, especially when you feel as if you can't write!<br>  <br>  But remember--writers write. Whether it's a paragraph or a page, write every day. It's the only way to get where you're going.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -E<br>  <br>  PS: A wise man once said, "You should know more about your characters than you'll ever use in their story."<br>  <br>  PSS: If you're going to start keeping notebooks with you, name them. It'll be fun; you can keep track. Here are mine:<br>  <br>  Aristotle<br>  Pierre<br>  Gisela<br>  Cherry<br>  Quincy<br>  Dan<br>  Wynston<br>  Astrid<br>  Thaddeus<br>  Desdemona<br>  Humphrey|`|eTS2nd70aa	Of course! It's called writer's block.<br>  <br>  What I suggest you do - and this is what I do all the time - is write certain scenes at a time if you're bored. Like, if you have a great idea for a scene that comes much later into the book, write it. Or, if you want, write the ending. It makes it a little more exciting, and that way, you can just write when an idea comes to you.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Yes, and no.  It depends on the person, and the level of commitment towards what they're writing.  Also, whether they're easily distracted, or not.<br>  <br>  There are many factors... but, as I said, it depends.<br>  <br>  But, it's not abnormal.|`|CyLtHvB9aa	It's normal for the vast majority. Some ideas can take you into new ones and then you get even more ideas. But some are shorter and can only take you so far into your writing process. However when this does happen, your lack of ideas I mean, you should try looking at or listening to things that inspire you. Sometimes lyrics in songs help me. Or even looking at the writing of other people. You know some authors don't even get and idea until they're asleep and it comes to them in a dream. If this happens to you, you should try and keep a notebook near by. Carrying a notebook around with you helps when you need names for characters as well. One author looked at a beaker and decided at once they wanted their character's last name to be Beaker. So I hope I answered your question.|`|SaNoaVVqaa	Yes it's absolutely normal!  It happens to me too!<br>  Go slow if you have to.  Go as slow as you need.  Sometimes I'll just write a sentence a day for a week, but it's better than if I rushed and wrote a whole suckish page in one day. <br>  Try reading books or listening to music.  Get some motivation from the lyrics or other stories (don't copy) and then writing will be easier.|`|QTMKolH6aa	Of course. The best if writers and authors do receive mental blocks frequently just because they have so many different thoughts roaming around in their head. Don't fret on how long it takes you to write something. Just keep trying and don't give up.

AjqO1aJgaa	It's not bad...but it's a bit "teens are people, adults are an alien race" for my taste. Teachers are people too. They don't go round humiliating people who've just been bereaved.<br>  <br>  To be honest I don't think you are very old - thirteen or fourteen, maybe? Not because of the writing standard which is fine, but because of that whole "adult = doesn't understand" thing. Adults are _more_ likely to understand how she feels, because a) they've been teens themselves, and b) they are more likely to have experienced bereavement.|`|MkEpS7pHaa	I think that story was really good.

tfsNIX4uaa	I am impressed by the choice of words that you use to describe what comes across as raw emotions at times and at other times an honest deep desire to discover more about yourself and your subject matter.  There is so much that one can change about content.  A lot has to do with what comes as inspiration and what remains as the result of reworking ideas in your head and putting them down on paper.  This whole work gives me the feel of what some would call a stream of consciousness expression.  A situation where you write from your heart without really knowing where it comes from.  My experience is that these situations give you less chance to edit yourself and change some things that are well enough left the way they are.  You have to look at your work and decide if you want to move lines around to give the whole idea more substance.  All that depends on your level of satisfaction with what you've accomplished.  And I do think you've accomplished a great deal with this.Your first line got my attention.  It was a good way to start for sure.

y8bFwXZEaa	Nineteenth Century American Transcendentalism is not a religion (in the traditional sense of the word); it is a pragmatic philosophy, a state of mind, and a form of spirituality. It is not a religion because it does not adhere to the three concepts common in major religions: a. a belief in a God; b. a belief in an afterlife (dualism); and c. a belief that this life has consequences on the next (if you're good in this life, you go to heaven in the next, etc.). Transcendentalism is monist; it does not reject an afterlife, but its emphasis is on this life. <br>  <a href="http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap4/4intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pa...</a>

lxYWZc9caa	What you have to do is bring it into photoshop first.<br>  Then create a new layer.<br>  Then draw on top of that layer with your tablet.<br>  Once you're done, you just delete the bottom layer (AKA the scan of your sign)<br>  And you should have it.<br>  Sorry I couldn't tell you how to make fonts though|`|OgcdoEDvaa	Hi... www.dafont.com has hundreds of free fonts you can download and install onto your computer. I believe once they are on your desktop you then have to be sure to open the file to have them import into all of your programs. Make sense? Well, I'm sure you will be able to find something that will match your font design, and as far as the rest of your graphics go, to clean it up and give it crisp lines, you may have to redraw it and it is best to use a lot of new layers to do that. For example, for the black section use a layer, and then a separate one for the blue, and then another one for the yellow part of the design. That is important because you can then erase or start over as you go along with each section. Still, there are other things you can do to give it a cool vibe. For example, you can duplicate the same layer twice (so you have three of the design, one of which you will keep as a master and not use) and then with the other two, Desaturate the bottom layer, meaning turn it into black and white by going to Image - Adjust - Desaturate. Then with the second top layer<br>  adjust it by using the free floating Layers/channels/paths window pull down tab that says Normal... try changing normal to pin light or overlay to see the effects. You can also use the opacity tool to then fade it a little. Also, depending on how clean your original drawing is, sometimes just using the Sharpen Filter will make it look more crisp. To do that go to the tool bar at the top, hit Filters - Sharpen, or sharpen edges. Basically, there is no quick way to take a sketch and turn it into a glossy pro design without repainting it, but you can experiment with the filters and layers to try something modern and new.<br>  <br>  Also, when repainting something, instead of doing it free hand, I like to use the Lasso Tool. First, start with a new layer to use for tracing over your original design. Then with the Lasso Tool icon pinpoint a good place to start tracing, then press and continuously hold down the Option key on your keyboard and then click the mouse... this allows you to start tracing an outline around something, and it is best to click in small lengths around the area in order to get a smooth line. And to complete it you have to go full circle and meet back up where you started with the first click. Then once you have outlined it, release the Option key and you will see a floating outline that you can fill in either with the Paint Bucket tool or by hand doing it with the Air Brush... but when you hand do it, be sure to paint close to the edges and make it as opaque as possible. It also helps to enlarge the area you are tracing <br>  as big as possible so that you can copy around the exact shape of the design. Then lastly, there is another quicker, but not so perfect, short cut to copying a section... You can use the Magic Wand. First, go to the existing design layer, then click in the area you are wanting to copy. Check to make sure the Magic Wand lines are hitting the edges of the area smoothly... You may have to set it at the correct tolerance by inputting the percentage on the tool bar. A higher tolerance will be stronger. Then once it does grab the exact area, create a new layer and then fill it in with color using the same steps as above. Both of these techniques are better then painting free hand and although it may take some practice, it is definitely worth doing for the cleanest design.|`|AA11241715	I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do, but if you want it tidying up and making cleaner you could try several things. I'm also not sure if these are in elements. Firstly, the best way is to actually use a vector package suck as Illustrator and convert it to strokes. If you are using Photoshop try using a gaussian blur filter on it at about 0.5-2? This will blur it, the intention being to get rid of any jagged edges. Then Threshold it back to pure black and white. This will give a solid shape, but it will be a little jaggy, so to allow it to print better then re-Gaussian blur it to 0.5-1 to just take away the little jaggies.<br>  <br>  Your other option is to go the other way and not make it look like it was done digitally. Go the other way- hand drawn with quality and flourish.<br>  <br>  These will still be graphics though. Alternatively if you want it as a font, instead of using Photoshop, download a font creator for your system.  Suggest you look on www.download.com  If you try font creator  or font maker in the search bar you'll get some packages. Some will be free/shareware.<br>  Have fun, hope it helps.

Take her features and use them in your story, or change her hair or eyes and leave the rest of her face alone. <br>  <br>  As far as the name. Try to pick something unique. Take one of your DVD's and go to the credits. Look at all the people behind the scenes, Best Boy, Photographers, Sound Crew, Gaffers, Lighting... etc... <br>  <br>  You can find some pretty unique names this way.

7d4296b653689a306cac74432add2e63aa	I'll give you two good points. First of all Strategy (as opposed to tactics). It's an important distinction in the study of military history, and one a surprising number of people fail to fully understand. Briefly stated, tactics is how you win battles, strategy is how you win wars. Alexander displayed a superior grasp of strategy, for example, by moving against Egypt, to his south, before continuing eastward into the heart of the Persian Empire. Many of his advisors questioned this move, but Alexander understood the need to secure his southern flank and his rear (and his supply lines) before attempting any further strikes against Persia.<br>  In the second place, Leadership. Alexander was beloved by his troops, and he demonstrated great personal courage in usually leading from the front (Unlike his main opponent, Darius, whose custom was to observe the battle from a safe distance).Beyond that, he understood better than most commanders of his time the need to take the best care possible of his troops.

3iRl21Pqaa	I googled it, and would recommend that you read the various reviews there, as it's not a wonder cure, contains chemicals that smell strongly and may cause dermatitis, but it does seem to work on SOME colours (not all).  However, I personally would advise you to consult a good hairdresser and take whatever advice they give.  The chemistry is familiar to them, and they know how much your hair and scalp can take.  A friend of mine nearly lost her hair through too many home perms followed by home-colour treatments, and it was horrific.
yoGWCH3gaa	The fingerings are all the same for each of the four saxophones. The only difference is the added A key on the back of the Bari sax below the thumb rest (Also below the register/octave key). It's very easy to go from one sax to the next, in terms of technical skill. The difficult part is becoming accustomed to the specific tuning problems of the instruments and the different tonalities of the instruments.|`|lgg7DLy9aa	Yes, all the fingerings are the same (with the exception of the low A key on most baritones). If you are switching around, your biggest concern should probably be embouchure. <br>  <br>  However, some alternate fingering keys are present or not present depending on the level of the model (pro, intermediate, or student) and the age. The spatula key and high F# key are almost always included on new pro horns, but are missing on some student/older models.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck.|`|6yZ7uABzaa	They're pretty much the same, but if it's a different brand that you're using the keys may be in slightly different positions. Bari has the low A key at the back, but you can get a low A out if you extend the sax! lol<br>  The sax it's most like is Tenor, cuz the shape is the same, but also in terms of size. there might be a few less keys for high notes on an alto than on sop, but i've never played sop properly before :/|`|4JppzNYeaa	yes, they are all the same, bari has a low Ab kew bellow the thumb rest

It goes with anything. Black can look good, but only with certain clothes, skin tones and HAIR colors. If your model has dark hair, her hair is going to be lost against a black background. You do not state if you are going to be using a hair light, so I would say to use grey to be on the safe side. All clothes are fine with it and all hair colors will stand out against it. <br>  <br>  steve

Perhaps it came from the brush of Raphael, or from a toddler's toes.<br>  <br>  To say that paint on a canvas is the result of someone consciously placing every detail may be a valid argument, but it is no more valid than the argument that paint can just as easily happen onto a canvas from accident or coincidence and be just as beautiful.<br>  <br>  In the end, it is still just paint on a canvas.

Usually you have to buy them online from companies like Volks, LUTS, Dream of Doll, SOOM, Iplehouse, Dollmore, Abio Angel, and lots of other companies. You might also want to check the company lists on Resinality or Den of Angels if you want more information.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you would get a marionette...they're not the same as ball joint dolls, though, so you would have to get them from a different. shop.

PwfS4T74aa	If you doubt yourself, you'll never get good. You'll just criticize yourself over and over, and even when you get something right, it won't seem good enough, and you'll drive yourself out of Ballet and not want to go back out of fear that you can't achieve perfection.<br>  <br>  <br>  What you need to do first is BUILD CONFIDENCE. you need to realize that no one is perfect at something when they first start out, and ballet takes determination, strength, will , and a love for dance. Ballet is one of the most difficult and hardest forms of dance to master, and 1 year is not sufficient time for ANYONE to get really good at it. If you start beating yourself up for not achieving something that nobody else can achieve either, your  causing yourself needless grief. <br>  <br>  Second, you need to PRACTICE and truly devote yourself to ballet. Don't let it take over your whole life ( although if it is such a strong passion as you say it is, you'll be okay with it taking up most of your free time). with time and effort, you'll be able to fling yourself across the room as if you were floating on thin-air on nothing but your toes (although Pointe is much farther down the road)<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't give up so easily|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	You can do this!

I can tell how much your driven to this goal you've set for yourself and as a college sophomore I am kind of envious. I was always pretty easily disheartened at ballet.

A bit heafty compared to similar SLRs but the best build and weather seals in its class.  The "big" thing actually makes it feel better for me and if your going to get an SLR, its gonna be relatively big anyways.  Also, the anti shake is in the camera, so what ever lens you get, it will work with that feature.  I opted to get a smaller, rangefinder like camera, the panasonic lumix lx3.  I love it.

iT9S20zvaa	He knew.  At the end of the story, he had the letter written by his mother that confirmed he was black.  And how ironic, huh?  To someone like this character, yes, in his mind, it would be important that others never find out.  I think he was concerned with how others would see him, perhaps being scorned in society as he had eventually scorned Desiree after the baby was born.  <br>  <br>  It's not as though people would literally take away his wealth, but his usual social circles would most likely have decided to turn their backs on him.  I think the story actually mentions that Armand no longer loved Desiree because the shame she had brought upon his family.  That is very telling of his thoughts and feelings about society in general.  He did not want to lose his status.<br>  <br>  I remember reading this.  He sure was a terrible character.
kXCgQoYLaa	Polka and Mazourka . The Waltz was a 19th century dance that became very popular in the ballrooms of Vienna. The Strauss family wrote waltz tunes that were in- demand then and are still popular now. It is said that most 'new' dances of that period were actually based on folk and peasant steps collected from villages in Poland and other Eastern European countries, and then ' gentrified' for the ballroom bourgeoisie|`|Dl9MJKf1aa	Waltz became popularised during the early 1920s.

AA10236380	Graphic designers need to think of how their images will scale up and down to reproduce in different formats and media.  Something that looks great on a 8.5x11 sheet of paper might not display well on a 50' long by 20' high billboard, or as a 160x160 pixel image on a web site, for instance.<br>  <br>  Also, graphic designers need to use basic math when laying out images or advertisements so that the material "balances" well on the page.  This relates to the use of space, shapes and colors.<br>  <br>  Graphic designers also often need to be able to tell their customers about the cost of printing their images --- say running 10,000 copies of a 2-sided, 2-fold, 4-color brochure on glossy paper (vs. using a cheaper paper or redesigning the piece to eliminate the need for folds or being double-sided, for instance).<br>  <br>  Lastly, graphic designers are often self-employed (a.k.a. "Freelance") and need to use math for basic bookkeeping.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Lots of geometry involved in general (shapes, angles, etc).  Figuring out how to stay within a given area on an assignment.

AA11678263	Hey Janie,<br>  <br>  You write beautifully.  You found your own error, so that's good as you evidently read it over again, which many people do not do.  You don't have to reveal your secrets to everyone, so keep them guessing with the plot line, and keep writing.  If the story is well formulated, it will all come out very well.<br>  <br>  My only advice for you at the moment is to keep re-reading your work every couple of days, because you are very emotionally invested in something while you are writing it.  When you have written some more and come back to earlier work, you will more clearly see where improvements can be made.  Keep writing and loving it, and I have every confidence you will succeed.<br>  <br>  Oh, and as someone else mentioned, bear in mind what your own character can see etc.  I switched to third person to give me more flexibility.<br>  <br>  old_but_still_a_child|`|TU7vDI95aa	Great writing for a twelve-year-old.  Keep practicing, keep reading, and keep learning.

Unless she's holding a mirror, she wouldn't be able to see her own teeth.|`|pkGDpaddaa	That's brilliant, for an adult, never mind a twelve year old! It's very descriptive and your spelling is impeccable! You've got me hooked, anyway. I'd definitely keep reading! I'd say you should be even more descriptive.. Describe what you see (e.e. Skylar; the lake; etc) And, of course, keep reading! :)|`|0eoVWw6kaa	i love it!!! i would keep reading!!!<br>  <br>  i think there should be some twist early on..like some one comes and  kidnap skylar and the main character to save them from their oncoming deaths... i hope i helped|`|Al2BE64paa	its really good but i dont understand what its about.|`|xJ9f7ekKaa	OH MY GOODNESS! that was amazing! you commented on mine but in my opinion yours is sooo much better! i love the description!|`|xG4j4RxUaa	Oh, I would say definitely keep writing - I can't believe you're only 12!

ot6OJ7JWaa	After WW1 Germany was weak and disgraced; it needed a leader. And that leader came in the form of a charismatic madman named Adolf Hitler, a WW1 Vet. At first, some where a bit dubious about his plans. However, after a stint in jail he left to become a fascist. He is nothing, if not ambitious. In 1933 he became the new head of German gov't, and continued gaining more and more power. He managed to convince everyone that the Jews where the reason that the Germany was poor, and that if they wiped out the Jews then the world would be much better for Germany.<br>  And that's how he gained power.|`|mksQ1Yckaa	Nazi's gained power in the Reichstag, so technically he was elected, but by the Nazi's who mostly populated the Reichstag.

4o3jaVHuaa	Please do your own reading. It's much more enjoyable, and you don't have to rely on others to do your homework for you. These are basic questions that could be answered by just reading the book.<br>  <br>  But I'll just answer your questions because I'm bored.<br>  <br>  1. This is presumably Tom and Daisy's child. For five years, all Gatsby could think about was marrying Daisy and starting a family with her. He was dejected to see that Daisy has a child instead with Tom; it made him feel that the Buchanans were linked and that Gatsby was no longer a part of Daisy's life.<br>  2. In the chapter, she tells him to his face. I believe it was Tom who started questioning Gatsby, and Gatsby bluntly told him, "Daisy never loved you." She is stuck between two men who wanted to claim her love for themselves and ends up telling Tom and Gatsby that she loved both of them.<br>  3. All I could imagine was that he was tired of hearing her constant complaining. Or he didn't want his customers to know of their plans.<br>  4. Tom was giving her an example of his love toward Daisy. He is trying to show her that he really does care about her, no matter what Gatsby claims.<br>  5. Tom believes that Gatsby got his money from working with a gang of boot-leggers (illegal alcohol smugglers) led by Wolfshiem. He confronts Gatsby about it in front of the others to discredit him.<br>  6. I think it was just when Gatsby got hold of the wheel that the car hit Myrtle. They didn't stop out of sheer panic.

If you sign on with a national talent agency then they can submit your headshot/resume/audition sample tape to various companies (like Disney) if they get word of a casting notice.<br>  <br>  Best of luck

2cc1a6ece155b26a9a3dc5c3417c72e2aa	I don't know of any sites where you get a commission for people just viewing your images.  However, you can upload your images to stock photography websites and get a commission every time somebody wants to use them or downloads them.  There are also sites that will sell your images to magazines and such to be used in ads or whatever the buyer wants.  These such sites normally make more per sale than stock photography sites, but it can sometimes take a long time to sell an image.  There are loads of stock photography sites out there, and you can submit to any number of them.  I have included a decent amount of sites to get started with in my sources.  For more, try searching for "sell your photos" in the Yahoo search engine.  You will get plenty of good results.
hpxc5szsaa	i not sure man...|`|b1192aac5ca4c80d0cfdeae01a844a98aa	So you don't REALLY want feedback on the poem, you just want someone to say that it's flawless.  Maybe the way that he suggested you change it seemed sort of like an order... "make it this instead of that"... but you'd do better to listen to all feedback or at least explain why you'd rather not change it instead of being rude.  As for the poem, I love the concept of making yourself heard right now and taking advantage of your time here before dying and potentially being forgotten.  Honestly, though, I don't like the beginning half of the poem.  It comes off as too harsh, especially the "I will kick your ***" and "I will kill you where you stand."  I think if the message of the poem is what I think it is, it should convey more of an urgency instead of threatening.  The second half of the poem, after the ..... is fantastic though, at least in my eyes.  My favorite part is the last two lines: "but it's your fault. your mistake."  In case you were wondering (not to be condescending or whatever, just trying to be helpful), decision is spelled... well, decision. lol.  You may want to change that, I don't know.  But good job, overall.|`|5GslKD4baa	"for the rest of the days of the earth,"<br>  <br>  make it:<br>  <br>  "for the rest of your days on Earth,|`|vIZNhjIQaa	wow
lgMZJQtwaa	heey<br>  make sure that you can kick your leg all the way to your had! practice leg spins and center leaps also practice switch leaps that will empres them! and go for that triple turn! and yeaah i would work on your memory cause if they teach you a dance at tryouts you dont wont to have a blank!|`|V2v66A7Waa	Try to get at least a triple pirouettes, since it is a competitive team. Also work on your second turns and fouettes. Routines do these many times as it is quite simple to do once you get a hold of it. It looks hard and great too. Also even though you may suck at footwork, you will do a routine and do it about a million times before you compete. Try to do many things that most other girls/guys cant do. For an instance when you are auditioning there would be an improv part. Many girls at the improv part do turns. If you cant do as many turns as them try to do something you are very good at. Tumbling is always very good. Also for the auditions at my school the first day we learn the routine and second day we have a kick line, and then we do the routine and then the improv. Practice at home if you get to audition the next day! HOpe you get on the team!

Now theres teenagers who think that having a kid makes them an adult. All they care about is their self image and their children are being raised by there grandparents, and for the ones actually being raised by teenagers...they dont grow up with good morals, children are allowed to cuss now more than ever, and are not disciplined. And the internet is also a big issue. But I wont get into that arguement, my point of view is its 50% because of teen pregnancy and 50% internet.|`|nfLd3ngraa	What do you mean by worst. Actually as a generations move on we get better at somethings and get worst at others. For instance, people today are less racist, and don't smoke as much. And go to college alot more.

It only seems like that to the older generation...because most can't keep pace with the changing times,  and hence criticise them.<br>  <br>  Every generation has its own struggles...and to survive,  devices new ways to deal with them.  This could necessitate riddance of some old values.  It need not be worse...only different!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Not true at all. My son makes a 6 figure salary.

My parents were pessimistic & I am able to explain to the next generation why being optimistic will give you a whole different life than being pessismistic.

Defiance towards the older generation.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	There is a subjective idea that many people like to cling to that the current generation is worse, and times are tougher than "in the good old days."

UDEMDcGuaa	Biologists, what would they know about it.<br>  <br>  Numbers cited like that are kind of meaningless, the time it took to build them is very vague 20-100 years.  For many years it has been believed that the ancient Egyptians used an army of slaves to get build the pyramids, there are a lot of theories about the various construction approaches, no need to cite occult, extra-terrestrial or secret lost technologies, just a lot of brutually used man power.

ZmdIlkpQaa	The primary difference was in engagement with the rest of the world.  After WWI, the US disbanded its military nearly completely, and retreated from the affairs of the rest of the world, and focused internally and publicly declared an isolationist ideal.  After WWII, although the same desire was still there, the danger of isolationism had been clearly shown, and the US stayed engaged in the affairs of the larger world, taking part in the occupation of German and leading the occupation of Japan, laying out huge amounts of money to help rebuild Western Europe and Japan to reduce the liklikelihood another rising dictatorship.  Shortly after the war, too, the growing threat of expansionist communism, and the evident weakness of the old European powers to deal with the threat alone convinced America to engage further (see the Greek Civil War), and to stand in direct opposition Stalin's Soviet Union across the whole world.  Ultimately, the responsibility imparted by our occupation of our former enemies and by having sole possession (until 1949) of atomic weapons forced us avoid burying our heads in the sand again, as we had after the previous war.

9be48b3e2023c49a5d1c79d3df602d9eaa	It would have to be the Leopold and Loeb case of 1924.  Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb murdered Loeb's distant relative (a 14 year old) Bobby Franks believing that they could pull off and get away with the perfect murder.  They even made it look like a kidnapping by mailing a ransom note.   The police found a pair of eyeglasses near the body.  There were only three of those type in Chicago, one which was owned by Leopold.  The alibis they gave fell apart and each blamed each other for doing the actual murder.<br>     Clarance Darrow was hired to defend them and made them plead guilty.  He did it because he could avoid a jury trial that might result in the death penalty.  In a speech that was considered one of his best, he pleaded for their lives arguing that it was what they were taught in school that made them do the crime.  Instead of being sentenced to death, the both got life sentences.  Loeb died in prision in 1936 and Leopold was released on parole in 1958.  He died in died in 1971

If it's adults, it's fine (except for the grammar) but if you're writing for children, you'll need to use age appropriate words.<br>  <br>  Edit: Read the intro and it put everything into place. I'd still use smaller words, and tighten up the intro, but the beginning needs to flow like the intro.

Adolf Wagner, the Party representative at the conference, argued that such actions would cease, once the Government decided on a firm policy against the Jews. <br>  <br>  Dr. Schacht, the Economics Minister, criticized arbitrary behavior by Party members as this inhibited his policy of rebuilding Germany's economy. It made no economic sense since Jews had certain entrepreneurial skills that could be usefully employed to further his policies. Schacht made no moral condemnation of Jewish policy and advocated the passing of legislation to clarify the situation. <br>  <br>  The following month two measures were announced at the annual Party Rally in Nuremberg, becoming known as the Nuremberg Laws. Both measures were hastily improvised (there was even a shortage of drafting paper so that menu cards had to be used) and Jewish experts from the Ministry of the Interior were ordered to Nuremberg by plane. <br>  <br>  The first law, The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor, prohibited marriages and extra-marital intercourse between “Jews ” (the name was now officially used in place of “non-Aryans ”) and “Germans ” and also the employment of “German ” females under forty-five in Jewish households. The second law, The Reich Citizenship Law, stripped Jews of their German citizenship and introduced a new distinction between “Reich citizens ” and “nationals.” <br>  <br>  The Nuremberg Laws by their general nature formalized the unofficial and particular measures taken against Jews up to 1935. The Nazi leaders made a point of stressing the consistency of this legislation with the Party program which demanded that Jews should be deprived of their rights as citizens.|`|9a83KBQ9aa	Because he was a nazi.

AA12272993	In general, a fast paced song would be ideal. Directors (speaking from my personal experience casting musicals) need someone who can manage to keep the show moving. Especially in the case if you were doing a "Hairspray" song, there's a reason why people call it "You can't stop to breathe" a fast paced song allows you to show that you can multi-task. In general upbeat songs involve a lot of dancing and require a different type of performer. Also, when auditioning you aren't being judged on whether you are good or not. You are being judged and evaluated for a specific role. If you come and nail a slow paced song, chances are you will be cast as someone who performs a slow paced song.

As maternal instincts towards a child of her own seems non-existent in her represent the fact how strong ruthless desire for power is.<br>  To be a mother was what was expected of a woman in that era as her prioritized task. Most of all to provide an heir, a successor to the family name. This shows selfishness as she does not care what future would hold for her family but what she would achieve in her own life time.<br>  Besides she uses that phrase to challenge his manhood comparing her will to kill her own child had he asked her to against him being reluctant to kill the king at her will.

If they are covered in paint and not clean then he is a bum if they are crisp and clean then hes worth more than the bristles on his brush. A pro painter can wear white because a good painter doesn't get paint on his "whites"  You wont see "union" painters, which are the best, with paint all over them. This is because they are great at what they do. They are fast and very neat. We wear white cause we paint white. I realize today people are doing all kinds of crazy colors and faux finishes which I do as well but back in the day it wasn't like that. 90 percent of jobs were done white.

ceBTTCPwaa	Of Mice and Men is a novella written by Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck. Published in 1937, it tells the tragic story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers during the Great Depression in California.<br>  <br>  Based on Steinbeck's own experiences as a bindle stiff in the 1920s (before the arrival of the Okies he would vividly describe in The Grapes of Wrath), the title is taken from Robert Burns's poem, To a Mouse, which is often quoted as: "The best-laid plans of mice and men/often go awry," though the phrase in the original Scots of the poem is "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men/Gang aft agley."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/j..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Of_Mice_and_Men" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Of_Mice_and_Men</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/omam/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/omam/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/micemen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/micemen/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/ofmiceandmen/i..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/ofmiceandmen/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/mice2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/mice2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Of Mice and Men thrives on the notion that everyone is isolated, and everyone seems to get along quite well together by talking about how isolated they are. Isolation in this novella is much more an abstract concept than a reality - the men are constantly together and chatting. It's the specter of having to move, to hit the open road again, make new friends, new enemies, and keep finding yourself all over again that seems to plague the men.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Isolation/Of Mice and Men

JS3Zy6ASaa	John Stuart Mill put forward an amendment to the Reform Act of 1867 to make it extend to women.  It was rejected amid a good deal of hilarity.  so - even at that stage, some did, though they were in the minority at that time.<br>  <br>  A man could argue that women had a say in their menfolk's votes before the introduction of the secret ballot in I think 1872.|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	The poet Shelly did - long before any suffragette movement - his partner Mary Wollstonecraft (they were parents of Mary Shelly who wrote Frankenstein) wrote 'A vindication of the rights of women' which at the time was ground breaking..<br>  <br>  Marx and Engels also did in the Communist Mannifesto..as too did Stalin and Lenin in Russia which was the first countries to enfranchise women...<br>  <br>  Tam is viewing the Q outwith the historical context - at the time - as is always the case, the group with societal power does not give that up willingly - usually a social movement is needed be it the suffragettes, civil rights movement in America etc - it is only once rights have been won and assimilated into the general psyche that the majority then support them.. sometimes not even then - it is still the case that often those with disabilities, women, ethnic minorities and homosexuals are sometimes disadvantaged..the problem is not everyone is disadvantaged to the same extent and so on..<br>  <br>  Prior to the first world war - the thought of women voting was ridiculed in both parilament and in the popular press as a ludicrous idea...|`|ebuxHnScaa	Yeah.

The long answer depends on exactly where and when you had in mind.

AA12343309	As the first poster stated you get 23 chromosomes each from both parents.<br>  <br>  One each is made up of Y & Mitochondrial DNA.<br>  Y goes from father to son only.  That is a man would get it from his father and his father and his father and so on down the line.  Mitochondrial goes from mother to both sons and daughters that his a sons and daughter get it from their mother and her mother and her mother and so on back down the line.  These are the 2 chromosomes that determine a persons sex.  <br>  <br>  The other 22 each are made up of your Autosomal DNA and really represents your total genetic pattern.   It determines your apperance such as pigmentation, bone structure, height etc.<br>  You get Autosomal 50-50 from both parents but not 25-25-25-25 from your 4 grandparents.  You get 50% from your paternal grandparents and 50% from your maternal gandparents, but it will not be even steven between grandfather and grandmother.  It is a toss up on how they came out in you and any of your siblings, irregardless whether they were male or female.<br>  <br>  Now, your parents have recessive genes that might not show up in them but can show up in you or maybe, your children. My older sister looked more like my mother's youngest sister than she did either of my parents.   Usually genes for darker pigmentation will dominate those for lighter pigmentation but that is not a set rule that is will happen that way.  <br>  <br>  We had a question as to whether a man inherits male pattern baldness from his father's side or his mother's.  He can get it from either one and then maybe one of his brothers will get it from the other.   People who try to state there is a set rule are usually going by how it turned out in their family and maybe some other family they knew.<br>  <br>  I might mention your question is really a genetics question rather than a genealogy question.  In genealogy we trace ancestry using documents/records.  The Biology board which is under Science and Mathematics might be more informative.<br>  <br>  Edit: I had asked a question about this on the Biology board earlier and got this reply:<br>  <br>  <br>  "Your mother's egg contributes one set of 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome (an X). Your father's sperm contributes the other set of 22 autosomes, and another sex chromosome (either an X or a Y).<br>  <br>  Where the 50-50 part breaks down is when you pass on your DNA to your children. Each of your children will get half their DNA from you, but they won't necessarily get an equal mix of what you inherited from your parents. They could inherit a more from your mother, through you, and less from your father, or vice versa.<br>  <br>  Another way to look at it: you inherited 50% of your autosomal DNA from each parent, but you didn't necessarily inherit exactly 25% from each grandparent. Your maternal grandparents contributed exactly 50% in total, but it could be biased in favor of either your maternal grandmother or your maternal grandfather. Same goes for your paternal grandparents."<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  PhD in molecular biology|`|12AGjK15aa	you get 23 chromosomes from each of your parents and it is 100% random which traits are expressed.<br>  <br>  also, look up meiosis and mitosis for the more technical and visual explanation.|`|IikTFnCxaa	The baby would get genes from both parents...There wouldn't be a case of just getting the most genes from one parent as far as I know..|`|0HAn67yZaa	you get 50% from your mother and 50% from your father.<br>  <br>  looks depend on genes.<br>  <br>  take me for an example, i look just like my father, if you seen my mom you wouldn't even think i was her daughter, my mom has green eyes, is slim, blonde hair, and short, my dad is tall, he has black hair and very dark brown eyes and he's overweight.<br>  <br>  i look like my dad's mother and grandmother.<br>  i'm short, i'm 5'0.<br>  i have black hair.<br>  dark brown eyes and i'm overweight.<br>  <br>  even though i have 50% from my mom, i look nothing like her at all.
lUzonjLfaa	A conference of ministers was held on August 20, 1935, to discuss the economic effects of Party actions against Jews. Adolf Wagner, the Party representative at the conference, argued that such actions would cease, once the Government decided on a firm policy against the Jews. <br>  <br>  Dr. Schacht, the Economics Minister, criticized arbitrary behavior by Party members as this inhibited his policy of rebuilding Germany's economy. It made no economic sense since Jews had certain entrepreneurial skills that could be usefully employed to further his policies. Schacht made no moral condemnation of Jewish policy and advocated the passing of legislation to clarify the situation. <br>  <br>  The following month two measures were announced at the annual Party Rally in Nuremberg, becoming known as the Nuremberg Laws. Both measures were hastily improvised (there was even a shortage of drafting paper so that menu cards had to be used) and Jewish experts from the Ministry of the Interior were ordered to Nuremberg by plane. <br>  <br>  The first law, The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor, prohibited marriages and extra-marital intercourse between “Jews ” (the name was now officially used in place of “non-Aryans ”) and “Germans ” and also the employment of “German ” females under forty-five in Jewish households. The second law, The Reich Citizenship Law, stripped Jews of their German citizenship and introduced a new distinction between “Reich citizens ” and “nationals.” <br>  <br>  The Nuremberg Laws by their general nature formalized the unofficial and particular measures taken against Jews up to 1935. The Nazi leaders made a point of stressing the consistency of this legislation with the Party program which demanded that Jews should be deprived of their rights as citizens.<br>  <br>  <br>  White Race (areian)- main idea.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	It barred marriage and sexual relations between Germans and Jews.|`|fe59898453c9fe7e6d2c637b92e81411aa	a series of laws discriminating jews in Nazi germany in  the 1930's

If you're sheet music says play it with a swing then do it. Ultimately the interpretation of the song is up to the player and everyone has a different interpretation of music just because you're teacher's interpretation is different than yours doesn't mean you are wrong do what feels more natural to you and what feels right to you. Good Luck!!!

Below are cited in Jefferson's autobiography.<br>  The restoration of the rights of conscience relieved the people from taxation for the support of a religion not theirs; for the establishment was truly of the religion of the rich, the dissenting sects being entirely composed of the less wealthy people; and these, by the bill for a general education, would be qualified to understand their rights, to maintain them, and to exercise with intelligence their parts in self-government: and all this would be effected without the violation of a single natural right of any one individual citizen. To these too might be added, as a further security, the introduction of the trial by jury, into the Chancery courts, which have already ingulfed and continue to ingulf, so great a proportion of the jurisdiction over our property. <br>  <br>  This Convention met at Philadelphia on the 25th. of May '87. It sate with closed doors and kept all it's proceedings secret, until it's dissolution on the 17th. of September, when the results of their labors were published all together. I received a copy early in November, and read and contemplated it's provisions with great satisfaction. As not a member of the Convention however, nor probably a single citizen of the Union, had approved it in all it's parts, so I too found articles which I thought objectionable. The absence of express declarations ensuring freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of the person under the uninterrupted protection of the Habeas corpus, & trial by jury in civil as well as in criminal cases excited my jealousy; and the re-eligibility of the President for life, I quite disapproved. I expressed freely in letters to my friends, and most particularly to Mr. Madison & General Washington, my approbations and objections.

1hvrQYWiaa	The immediate cause was a Protestant revolt in Bohemia, which replaced Archduke Ferdinand of Styria, a Catholic who was soon to become Holy Roman Emperor, with Frederick of the Palatinate, a Protestant, as their king.<br>   In a wider sense, having regained Bohemia, Ferdinand decided to conquer the other German Protestant states in Germany and reimpose Catholicism on them by force.The Spanish supported Ferdinand - the Spanish King was his Habsburg cousin. The French, although a Catholic power, thought this would make Austria too strong and therefore a threat to France, which would be faced by Habsburg enemies to the south (Spain) and east (Austria). The French therefore decided to support the Protestants, initially with subsidies - they paid first the Danes, then the Swedes to invade Germany - and later with troops.<br>   So, although the war was initially caused by religious conflict, it was expanded and prolonged by dynastic rivalry between the French Bourbons and Austro-Spanish Habsburgs.<br>  <br>  Results:<br>  Sweden became a major European power for the next 60 - 70 years<br>  Austria was forced to abandon its traditional alliance with Spain<br>  France became the dominant European military power<br>  Holland and Switzerland confirmed as fully independent countries (from Spain and the Holy Roman Empire respectively)<br>  Protestantism in Germany saved|`|lUzonjLfaa	The causes of the Thirty Years War can be traced as far back as the renaissance period.  It was during the renaissance that such ideals as secularism, humanism, individualism, rationalism and above all else secularism were first apparent in main stream society.  These ideas led to the protestant reformation, which is an even more direct cause of the war.  The split of the Catholic Church, as a result of the protestant reformation left Europe in a state of religious turmoil and chaos.  The gradual increase in intolerance and religious sectionalism that coincided with the addition of new religions and even more diversity has been marked as the main cause of the Thirty Years War.  The effects of the war would prove to be devastating to most of Europe, evidenced by the sharp drop in population, but it was especially devastating to Germany.  However, there were some countries and bodies of people that emerged from the conflict improved such as France, Sweden, and the religion of Calvinism.    <br>  <br>  There were many territorial and dynastic issues that figured in the outbreak and conduct of the war as well, but it is believed that these factors did not become important until the middle stages of the war. The territorial and dynastic causes, which go hand in hand, did however, cause the war to continue longer than it most likely would have if religion had been the only motive.  The extent of religious motives therefor is debated, but cannot be dismissed. <br>  <br>  The immediate causes of the war began with the resistance and eventual revolt of Protestant nobles in Bohemia, due to the religious intolerance mentioned before, which was under Hapsburg domination, against the Catholic king Ferdinand.  The reasons and causes for its spread throughout Europe include the constitutional frailty of the Holy Roman Empire, the inability of the German states to act in concert, and the ambitions of other European powers. These were the causes that would eventually be responsible for the war lasting as long as it did.<br>  <br>  The political motives became more and more prevalent when Sweden entered the war to help the Protestant cause.  Sweden did not enter the war for religious reasons at all; they were looking to gain land.  Finally it seemed that religion was completely forgotten and abandoned as a cause when Catholic France and Protestant Sweden joined forces against the Catholic Hapsburgs.  France was worried that the Hapsburgs were becoming too powerful so they decided to assert their influence into the war.<br>  <br>  The results and effects of the war and the two peace treaties were highly significant. France replaced Spain as the greatest power in Europe. With Sweden, France had blocked the Habsburg efforts to strengthen their authority in the Empire. At Westphalia, the right of the individual states within the Empire to make war and conclude alliances was recognized. In theory as well as in fact, the most important of these states became virtually autonomous, and German unity was postponed for more than two centuries. The Empire was further dismembered by the recognition of the independence of Switzerland and the seven northern provinces of the Netherlands. Two new powers emerged in northern Germany. France received most of Alsace by the Treaty of Westphalia, and by the Treaty of Pyrenees parts of Flanders and Artois in the Spanish Netherlands and lands in the Pyrenees.<br>  <br>  The religious settlement at Westphalia confirmed the predominance of Catholicism in southern Germany and of Protestantism in northern Germany. The principle accepted by the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 that Catholic and Lutheran princes could determine the religion practiced in their territory was maintained, and this privilege was extended to include the Calvinists as well.<br>  <br>  The Austrian Habsburgs had failed in their efforts to increase their authority in the Empire and to eradicate Protestantism, but they emerged from the war stronger than before. In Bohemia, they had stamped out Protestantism, broken the power of the old nobility, and declared the crown hereditary in the male line of their family. With Bohemia now firmly in their grasp and with their large group of adjoining territories, they were ready to expand to the east in the Balkans, to the south in Italy, or to interfere once more in the Empire.<br>  <br>  The real losers in the war, however, were the German people. Over 300,000 had been killed in battle. Millions of civilians had died of malnutrition and disease, and wandering, undisciplined troops had robbed, burned, and looted almost at will. Most authorities believe that the population of the Empire dropped from about 21,000,000 to 13,500,000 between 1618 and 1648. Even if they exaggerate, the Thirty Years War remains one of the most terrible wars in history.|`|mTf5mH6qaa	Causes- resistance/revolt in Bohemia (religious intolerance)<br>  <br>  Effects- France takes Spain's place as the biggest powerhouse in Europe.

AA11825978	basically militant catholicism is when radical catholic believers came together Europe to overthrow the Protestant leaders.  Keep in mind that this isn't just something political or religious, these guys used violence to get their points across that catholicism was and should be the dominate religion of the time. <br>  <br>  Historical awareness lay behind much Victorian anti-Catholicism. To many Protestants, Catholicism conjured up vivid pictures of plots against their Protestant state (several plots against Queen Elizabeth, Guy Fawkes gun powder plot, 1605, Titus Oates and the Catholic Plot of 1680, for example) or of the Spanish Inquisition, the Armada of 1588, or the invasion of Ireland by Louis XIV to put the deposed Catholic monarch, James II, back on the English throne (the Battle of the Boyne, 1690).|`|8WdFnf0Eaa	Well, one fo the effects was the Spanish Inquisition, and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain.

mqV9TOv0aa	A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.  ~Charles Darwin<br>  <br>  Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.  ~William James<br>  <br>  Dance Like No Ones Watching ~Author Unknown<br>  <a href="http://www.midnightangel308.com/dance_like_no_ones_watching.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.midnightangel308.com/dance_li...</a><br>  <br>  We convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another. Then, we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to go on a nice vacation, when we retire. The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when? Your life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway. One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred D Souza. He said, "For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - REAL LIFE. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then, life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life." This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have. And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time with... and remember that time waits for no one. Stop waiting until you finish school, until you go back to school, until you lose ten pounds, until you gain ten pounds, until you have have kids, until your kids leave the house, until you start work, until you retire, until you get married, until you get divorced, until Friday night, until Sunday morning, until you get a new car or home, until your car or home is paid off, until spring, until summer, until fall, until winter, until you are off welfare, until the first or fifteenth, until your song comes on, until you've had a drink, until you've sobered up, until you die -- to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy. Happiness is a journey, not a destination.<br>  <br>  <br>  ME!<br>  <br>  .|`|wjCJhxPZaa	Don't take life too seriously...<br>  <br>  Your not getting out alive...|`|42223372622a38f2018e30c03299ab0eaa	Yes, but what do you consider important?|`|98UiMvb8aa	Since you have this one 'physical' life in which your senses are heightened, your brain is fairly matured, your personality is rather fashioned to your liking, evaluating what is 'important' therefore becomes easier. Some things are not as important to some people like procreating, being a 'married person', working one job for 'the rest of their life', etc. <br>  <br>  Yet if those things are important, you can bet the individual will do what they can, not 'whatever it takes', to make it happen. Procrastination is not a habit but a practice of a habit that leads to eventual dis-satisfaction. I have been guilty of 'putting things off' for a more appropriate time, but for some they don't have a clue when the 'appropriate time really is'. <br>  <br>  Even if a life depended on it, like the last male in a family that has yet to 'carry on the name of the family'. A certain pressure is placed on this guy who MUST become part of the procreation circus finding a suitable mate to make this particular event come to fruition. If that man does not want to, it cause a certain cognitive dissonance and therefore is ignored or put off for a 'better time'. Of which honestly there will not be a 'better time' if the  mindset about such a venture' is not agreed upon. <br>  <br>  I hope I have answered to your satisfaction as this one was a little difficult to pin point exactly what you are seeking . . .<br>  <br>  sharing the light,<br>  Miss Erica Hidvegi|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...depends on what important in Life is...<br>  ...making more money?...<br>  ...traveling around the world?...<br>  ...sex, women, and drugs?...<br>  ...or going to your daughter's ballet play?...<br>  ...what's important in your life...<br>  ...is your choice to make...|`|27ff3ae0ea44baa8d83a0cb0117b9053aa	that's one of the main reasons people create crisis situations... to rouse one to action.

ZsCAXId7aa	The poem is very descriptive, you have a sort of diluted attention for details but is OK.

There's no "normal" situation against which you should hold yourself.<br>  <br>  The question you ought to be asking yourself is, "Am I happy with where I am now, compared to where I was a year ago?"<br>  <br>  If your answer is Yes, then you are done. Don't let other people tell you where you "should" be. That's absurd.<br>  <br>  But if your answer is No, then you need to do some honest self-examination. Ask where you want to be, what you'd like to be able to do, and how far you think you are from achieving that.<br>  <br>  Then, make changes to achieve that goal. Increase your practice time or get an instructor, or join a group guitar class or a band or a jam session, or whathaveyou.<br>  <br>  After that, if you have specific concerns such as "I've been playing a year with a book I got at Guitar Center, and I think that by now I should be playing Paganini adaptations" then we can all confidently tell you you're crazy. :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, and don't give up!!|`|KS2sfVBcaa	It all depends on how much you practice at your instrument after a year if you practice well you should be pretty good but only if you practice , practice usually daily for 30 60min.

IKoagU4Daa	Not exactly...<br>  Power chords are quite effective (and somewhat necessary) when it comes to down to playing with any sort of distortion/overdrive.  The power chord only contains the root and 5th, so by taking out the third--it keeps it from being muddy sounding. So using them doesn't mean you 'suck', but don't expect to really wow anyone with your playing.<br>  <br>  How good should you be after a year?<br>  It depends on what you practice, and how often you're praciticing.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	No, it doesnt mean you suck. However, if you ONLY play powerchords, and dont know anything else... well then yea, you kinda do.

WaJdOaFKaa	That would be the D90, out of those listed.  I own a D80, and it works quite well.  The D40 is also a great camera, but I prefer the D80 as a matter of flexibility and resolution only.  The D90 however, is a replacement to my D80, and is better than my D80 in almost every way possible - more resolution, better LCD screen, enhanced picture controls, greater ISO range with less noise, and other features I probably wouldn't use like HD live video recording and live view (which I hear comes in handy in certain situations) - all for the same price, if not cheaper than what I paid for my D80 two years ago.  I chose not to upgrade because of my belief that there will never be a digital camera that will stay good enough for the market for me to bother.  I don't wish to continually upgrade every time the next better thing comes out like I do with cell phones.  So, don't get caught up in all of the tech hype.  A digital SLR purchased now will provide a desired result, the same as those purchased a year ago did.  My D80 is the best I can get from digital that doesn't do better than my film does on a bad day.  So, if I had to choose between those listed today, having no frame of reference, I'd go with the D90.  Then I'd just shoot with it until it physically fell apart - despite any replacements that may make it obsolete.  I chose my D80 over the D40 at the time because of size and ergonomics (I have big man hands), and because it was the newest thing out.   Sure, I'd love a "newer" camera (like a D700), but I can't afford one.  So the camera I spent $1400 on two years ago will do for at least the next two years, perhaps longer.  The D80's 10 megapixel resolution will get me a good 12x18" print if captured and processed well - good enough for me.  For what I spent two years ago on a camera and lens, you can get a D90 and lens and have a good set-up that will serve you well for a long time.<br>  <br>  That's my opinion, anyway.|`|AsL8KhgLaa	All three of those cameras are great in their own respect, and you would be getting a great camera no matter which one you buy. Depending on how serious you are about photography, I would do with the D90. <br>  <br>  I bought my D90 for several reasons. The D90 is much like the more expensive D300 (often called a mini D300), which is a professional grade camera. The D90 has more frames per second, a bigger LCD screen, more megapixels, live view (none of the other models have it), video mode, better ISO performance, the list goes on. The only advantages the other models have is the cheaper price. <br>  <br>  Like I said, you'd be getting a great camera with any of those models, it's just a case of what you are willing to spend and what you are going to need. Of you don't need the higher megapixel, higher frame rate, higher ISO shooting in lower light, then one of the other versions may be better for you.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Well of the Three, the D90 is best. Larger screen, better low-light performance, and expanded ISO capability. You have more resolution, and of course HD video recording. You do not get this with any of those other cameras. If you have the money, i would say the D90 is the best of the options. If you do not need to video, the D80 is good too.

The road that is what i am.<br>  <br>  <br>  Were you in a hurry to type this poem or something? Anyways, I'm good at editing (says my English and Science teachers and my friends and schoolmates), so if you have any trouble with grammar and spelling you can send them to me and I'll check them for you. I love editing. Almost as much as I love sharpening pencils... (don't judge!)<br>  <br>  Wait... now that I've read it over several times, I think I understand what you mean. The path thing is kind of like choosing friends. You chose the wrongs ones, and you wouldn't be who you are now without them. But one thing I don't understand is why you used redemption and betrayal when talking about the same thing. A redemption is like a rebirth or deliverance from your sins. So are you saying that you're being saved and... betrayed?|`|rPk5n2wjaa	I'm not to sure what your trying to say but the wording is good
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	You can play any song that calls for a capo in the open position.<br>  The only difference would be a change of key.|`|FViagGVEaa	Capo's are like ten bucks, its super easy to get one<br>  <br>  But a friend of mine rocked a totally ghetto pencil tied down with a shoe lace for a while.....|`|AA12339318	If you know how to "barr" chords, then you can play most of your open chords down a few frets.<br>  <br>  Basically, it means that you play most of your familiar open chords with the middle, ring and pinky fingers, using your index finger to lay across the fret behind the chord.  In other words, your index finger replaces the "nut" or the top of the fretboard.<br>  <br>  For every fret you can play down along the neck is a half step higher key.  So, if you are playing a progression using the A, D, and E chords, but one fret down, with your index finger across the top fret, you are actually playing in an A sharp.  Two frets, and the same fingering means the tune is in the key of B.<br>  <br>  It's a handy little shortcut to playing a familiar song in an unfamiliar key.  It takes practice and some hand strengthening, but is still worth learning the technique.  A capo is SO much easier, and I still use one, but sometimes, like when doing a tricky chord change in the middle of the song, it is faster and smoother to barr a chord higher.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	The main reason to use a capo is that you want to continue to use the same open chord shapes you already know while transposing the song into a key you or your friend the singer can sing with.<br>  <br>  IOW, lets say the guitar player used a capo on the original recording -- he had the capo on the 4th fret and played G, C, and D chords in open position (G: 320003, C: X32010, D: XX0232).  With the capo on at the 4th fret, he's fingering open G, C and D shapes but sounding 2 whole steps above that -- the key of B -- B, E, and F#.   <br>  <br>  You *could* just play a barre chord B, an E, and a barre chord F#  (B: 224442, E: 022100, and F#: 244322) but those chord shapes won't give you the same sound (the same "voicings") as the open chord shapes with the capo.  So if you want to play in the same key as the recording, and get the same sound, you have to use a capo.<br>  <br>  Or maybe the recorded key of B is a little too high for you to sing in, but the key of A works just fine for you.  In that case, move the capo down 2 frets to the second fret and play your open G, C and D shapes and, voila! you're in A. Or if you or your singer needs the song to be in C, move the capo up one more fret to the 5th fret, play G, C and D shapes, and you're in C. <br>  <br>  OTOH, if you can sing the song in G without the capo, then just go ahead and play the open G, C and D shapes without it and sing the song in G. <br>  <br>  The point is, a capo gives you flexibility.  Why not use it?|`|irMjJhtPaa	I usually stay away from capos. You can either use bar chords or, If you want to play along with the recording. Tune your guitar differently.|`|KGuq4iYEaa	shoe lace, scarf anything like that.

AA10015648	You should focus more on BEING a good friend, than HAVING a good friend.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't totally ignore your own needs in a relationship, but if you are more focused on what someone else wants and needs more than what you need, you'll end up happier, and with more friends!<br>  <br>  Not everyone wants deep conversation. I personally don't like having deep conversations until I really know a person, because I've been hurt by people who I've told my story to. I've had them tell the guy that I had a secret crush on that I liked him... it's a hurt that's unfortunate, because it means I'm less likely to have deep conversation with the next friend.<br>  <br>  Be considerate of people like me. You're probably a great person, and someone like me may be a GREAT friend to someone like you, but if you shut that person out just because they won't start talking about their deepest darkest secrets only a few weeks into the relationship, you could be missing out. Not only that, but I might have liked you and if you "ditched me" as you say you do to friends who don't open up, it might hurt a lot! <br>  <br>  So yeah - BE a good friend, and people will want to be a good friend back. If you're giving and giving and someone simply doesn't give back, then maybe you guys aren't cut out for friendship, and that's okay. Learn to be flexible and stop putting so much pressure on others to measure up to your ideal "friendship"<br>  <br>  Good luck!

oKYB3Po7aa	Napoleons basic strategy on the battlefield was to turn his opponents right flank.  When they pulled back to guard the flank, Napoleon would send his cavalry through the angle unopposed and create havoc behind the enemy lines.  This brought about the square formations that the British used after having watched his tactics.  Superior numbers and raw recruits after the Russian disaster sealed his fate.  The Russian disaster was due to the Russian's scorched earth policy.  Basically he was having a hard time feeding his army on the march to Moscow.  Disease and starvation due to lack of food killed more of his men than the  winter and combat.

Ec2uIBjxaa	Middle splits!<br>  <br>  begin by sitting in a straddle stretch on a mat or like somethin soft, When stretching the middle splits during warm-up, go slowly. Even if you are very<br>  flexible, your muscles need time to adjust.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Lean towards each leg and towards the middle, just as you would for a plain "V" sit. Gradually work your legs wider, stretching your torso to each leg as you increase the straddle<br>  .<br>  Step3<br>  Roll your hips forward when your legs are fully split, moving your body into vertical alignment. The correct position is with toes pointed and your knees forward. The inside of your feet should lie flat on the mat. This is also the position you will use on the beam, allowing your toes to grab the edge.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Straighten your back. Although some arch is necessary due to your hip alignment, an over-arched back will receive a penalty in gymnastic competition. Lift your torso tall and tuck in your stomach.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Allow a gymnastic teammate to lift one of your legs carefully when you're in a full middle split. This helps you stretch into an over-split, which is necessary when performing your splits during a jump.<br>  <br>  Tips:::::::xx<br>  <br>  * Try stretching more often but not applying so much pressure that you're sore the next day. Instead of stretching once a day and forcing the split, stretch 3 times a day and use less pressure.

PiTFpjWqaa	How about thinking of doing something a bit different? Of course, it does depend on your own personal dance experience, that is, what styles you have trained in - or possibly taught yourself.<br>  <br>  If you were thinking of doing a slow, lyrical dance then how about taking some argentine tango music  (or something tango-based such as Grace Jones 'I've Seen That Face Before'), basing your dance around a lyrical theme but learning and throwing in some tango-based moves. <br>  <br>  If you wanted a fast streetdance, how about making it more reggaeton (there are videos on youtube if you don't know what it is) That will be stand out from the other more regular street/break dance routines.<br>  <br>  If you're trained in jazz or tap you could do a theme of 'freedom' based around the 20s jazz age; use the Charleston or 'Doop' by Doop as a starting point. <br>  <br>  If you're not trained in any particular style then you may have to work a little harder. I'd strongly advise you to think carefully about your music choice. Examiners and teachers will get sick of hearing the current popular hits over and over. Try choosing something a little bit different or something particularly emotive. Take inspiration from many forms of dance, watch musicals and videos off youtube of various dance styles for ideas. Choose you music first - something that feels just right - then work out your theme from that. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GWM5Wt49aa	Do that one with 'Money' in the lyrics (quite new/Black male singer/ great rythmn) and do it to the credit crunch.

Also, if you like vampires, check out JR Ward (start at the beginning with "Dark Lover," but the 2nd and 3rd book are great too).  I also just read "Fantasy Lover" Sherrilyn Kenyon which was really good (it was about greek and roman mythology in modern day).|`|GljEiugjaa	yea the hunger games is like the best book ever, but not based on romance, i would have to say the twilight series, mostly breaking dawn...|`|7c2bddaa6182384ee6477a0b9cb66f4faa	Some that are set modern-day are books by Rachel Gibson.

NYU37jfGaa	There is no evidnce that midwives were ever particularly singled out as victims in witch trials, and quite a lot of evidence that they were not.   In 'Witches and Neighbours' Robin Briggs writes:<br>  <br>  'Professional help in delivery ws normally provided by midwives and it has been widely supposed that any misfortune might be blamed on their witchcraft, allegedly linked to their position as 'popular' healaers in traditional folklore.  Midwives have thus become a paradigmatic case of female medical specialists under attack from men who wanted to control them and destroy their autonomy.  Whatever truth therer may be in these wider claims, the putative association with witchcraft is illusory.  No statistical evidence of any signifciance has been produced to support it: where figures have been established they show that midwives were rather under-represented among the accused.  In general, it is easy to understand why midwives were rarely accused, they were slected precisely because they were regarded as trustworthy persons by the community, so that it must have taken a catastrophic drop in their standing for them to become suspects.'<br>  <br>  In fact, as Briggs goes on to relate, when midwives were involved in witchcraft trials, it was not usually as suspects, but as searchers of suspects:<br>  <br>  'Many people evidently believed that there must be infallible signs of belonging to the secret army of the Devil that could be uncovered with sufficient aptitude: perhaps this betrayed a certain unease with the whole business of extorting confessions under torture.  In England and her American colonies these tests were usually carried out by special feminine juries of matrons and midwives, who form one of the most unexpected groups of witch-finders.  Indeed the names of Hopkins and Stearne should be linked with that of Goodwife Mary Phillips, also of Manningtree, who was the third of these "unspotted lambs of the Lord" and accompanied them on their expeditions, organizing such juries to search women.'<br>  <br>  'As has already been mentioned, the idea that midwives were commonly accused of witchcraft has proved quite untenable.  A painstaking check of all known British cases reveals precisely two rather dubious instances in England, and fourteen out of some 3,000 accused in Scotland.  In both countries midwives, far from being prime targets, are under-represented among the suspects.'|`|YXGdwwTJaa	It depends on where they were.  In the British isles it was usually women who were accused or witchcraft, but this was as women were still regarded as male possessions and any sign of independence or difference would be pounced on.  In some places, such as Germany, many men were also included.  <br>  <br>  To find useful books either look on the internet, some booksellers give you ideas about the contents of the books. Some books actually have some pages on the internet, but I think you need to look them up by name, not sure.  Or look in one of the books mentioned for a bibliography and use that.
9j17S6azaa	This poem is about holding back anger, I hope you got that far. What makes it confusing is the last two stanzas.<br>  <br>  As of now, I believe it is telling you that if you bottle anger so much because of fear (I watered in fear), not only will it grow (notice how the tree is a symbol for the anger) but it will grow bigger than it should and was initially.<br>  <br>  Now, it may mean that you killed your enemy because of this outgrown wrath (outstretched usually connotes to a cadaver) just as it could mean that you just bottled your anger (a tree is solid and lifeless... trees don't take action just as the speaker didn't). I think that is up to you to decide.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|oYqKiocLaa	I think that it might mean that if your nice to everyone including your enemies then they could become your friends|`|rPk5n2wjaa	I think it's talking about bottling up your hatred and it built up so much that you went over the top and ending up killing your enemy.

There is not much else about Duncan's achievements, but we are led to believe that he was a good and just king.<br>  <br>  - He had two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain. There is nothing about a wife.<br>  <br>  - The witches prophecies and Lady Macbeth's ambitious urgings convince Macbeth that he deserves to be king, so he invites Duncan to his castle and murders him.

8AYA5gTBaa	The film is called 120, not 120mm. The number comes from Kodaks naming convention.<br>  <br>  Your DianaF+ likes ISO 400 films. What you need to look for is 120 film with an ISO rating of 400. You can use slower (ISO 200 or ISO 160) films if you plan on shooting in bright sunlight. Otherwise, you should stick with the recommended 400.<br>  <br>  There are several films that fit this bill, in Black and White, and Color.<br>  <br>  I recommend going with a major manufacturer, like Kodak, Ilford or Fuji, because they all use light colored backing paper with black numbers. This is good because it makes reading the frame number through the red counter window much easier.<br>  <br>  BW films:<br>  Kodak - Tri-X, Tri-X Pro 320, T-MAX 400<br>  Ilford - Delta Pro 400, HP-5<br>  <br>  Color Films:<br>  Kodak - Portra 400VC, Portra 400NC<br>  Fuji - Fujicolor Pro400H.<br>  <br>  I like to buy my film from my local photo supply store, but if there isn't one nearby, online stores are good.

I happen to think that black and white film is the best "match" for the style and look of the Diana / Holga photos. Personally, I like using Ilford XP2 ISO 400 film. This is a great all around film for these cameras and it has the advantage of being C-41 process, which means it is easier to have developed. In most cases, it will still have to be sent out to do this. You can use Wal Mart to process it. Just be sure and use the SEND OUT mailers and clearly write SEND OUT ONLY. 120 C-41 BLACK AND WHITE.<br>  <br>  Here are some of my shots using a Holga with this film.

AA10084471	The first thing you should know is that Toni Morrison is alive and well and still writing; indeed she has a new book out now.<br>  <br>  I'll quote what the Nobel Prize committee said about her work in 1993:<br>  <br>  ""[Toni Morrison] who, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality."<br>  <br>  "My work requires me to think about how free I can be as an African-American woman writer in my genderized, sexualized, wholly racialized world". These are the words of this year's Nobel Laureate in Literature, the American writer Toni Morrison, in her book of essays "Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination" (1992). And she adds, "My project rises from delight, not disappointment ..."<br>  <br>  Toni Morrison is 62 years old, and was born in Lorain, Ohio, in the United States. Her works comprise novels and essays. In her academic career she is a professor in the humanities at the University of Princeton, New Jersey.<br>  <br>  She has written six novels, each of them of great interest. Her oeuvre is unusually finely wrought and cohesive, yet at the same time rich in variation. One can delight in her unique narrative technique, varying from book to book and developed independently, even though its roots stem from Faulkner and American writers from further south. The lasting impression is nevertheless sympathy, humanity, of the kind which is always based on profound humour."

Certainly there are some basic principles.  But our current situation wants to control that inner savage so much that even if it is exposed a little it gets punished and along with it so do we.  The only way to fullfill the savages desire and do so legally is if it has something to do with making money on a taxpaying business level.  Other than that we are nothing but rotten criminals.  Therefore the capitalist consumeristic mindset of my fellow Americans has ultimatley made our Country into a place where "Freedom" is just a selling point.

Some good intermediate brands are Alvarez, Ibanez, Ephiphone, Breedlove, Yamaha, Fender, Godin, Takamine, and more are available in the $300-to-$500 range.<br>  <br>  You could graduate to a 12-string guitar once you've accomplished the mastery of many chords, but stick with the six-string for a while.<br>  <br>  Visit a reputable music store and take with you a friend who can play guitar and can best show you what to look for and listen to the tonal qualities.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ixOE0onnaa	there  is a huge differnce between that more stringes.|`|EWvzQ4Syaa	I assume you mean acoustic. <br>  There isn't a big difference between 6 and 12 strings. on a 12 string the strings are merely doubled up to make a brighter sound. <br>  You should probably start with 6.<br>  Avoid ovation.

Or instead of a girl, it could be someone that he loves or something that he loves.<br>  Or he could actually be talking about a tree.

yWloDrF8aa	If you were able to tighten the film with the rewind knob after the first two frames and the knob is now turning with each exposure it sounds as though the film is loaded correctly and your film should be fine.<br>  The reason you are recommended to check the film is taut after loading it is to ensure that it is securely attached to the take up spool.<br>  The film in the cassette is not wound tight so if you don't check it for tightness it may take a few frames before the rewind knob starts to turn which appears to have happened in your case.<br>  Thankfully you didn't open the camera and you did the right thing by checking the tension first.|`|u1FlCXL0aa	hey im sorry ive been doing photography for half a year<br>  i have no clue what you said <br>  but if u didnt if you took two picture on one yeah its gonna be messed up<br>  but u wont really know til u develop it<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309161044AAUk7q5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|xJCFgEneaa	Yes they will-the first two at least, the rest probably will be fine.  First of all, when you took them, you took them on the same frame.<br>  <br>  Also, when you opened up the back of your camera you exposed your film to light.  That means the double exposure you just took will now turn out to be all black when you develop your negatives, and possibly the next one or two you took after fixing it.  The rest of the pictures you take after fixing your film should turn out just fine.<br>  <br>  Photography can be a little frustrating at first.  I know for one of my projects in my first photo class, I didn't realize my semi-automatic 35mm SLR was out of battery.  I took four rolls of this new expensive film I bought, developed them all, and all of them were blank.  Money and hours of work down the drain there.  Just don't give up, and even if one roll doesn't work out, you can always take another.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Simply put your camera on a tripod, while in Tv mode, set the desired shutter speed, release the shutter (preferably using a remote shutter release or the self-timer)<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure this is all detailed in the owner's manual.  Read it.|`|i5OVORXgaa	For a beginner, set your camera to shutter speed priority (Tv), then choose the shutter speed... the camera will set the rest.|`|xJCFgEneaa	You'll want to invest in a tripod.

You'll also want to set a long shutter speed.<br>  <br>  For shutter speed, turn the mode wheel thing on the top to "Tv", which stands for time value.  Then you can set the shutter speed to something nice and long, a few seconds, unless you're light painting where you'll want something even longer.  It should automatically adjust the aperture to be a good number when you do this.|`|Yjn1T4mNaa	no, use manual. You can control all of the settings yourself. And get a tripod.  Set the iso to 100 (you might want it higher if you're exposing for a short time though) and set the f number to a big number (turn the dial on the camera to the left) to like 30 seconds (or however long you want to expose the sensor.) you can even set it to bulb, and you can control the amount of time you expose it. You have to keep your finger on the shutter release button though.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Expensive is a relative term.<br>  If you didn't steal it or buy it from a street 'vendor', you should have a owner's manual/handbook.

kfOpbbCyaa	Maybe I'm being dense, but what do you mean? Jane Eyre calls them her cousins, because they are. She calls them Mary, Diana, St. John, because those are their names. If this isn't what you meant, could you please clarify?<br>  <br>  Note: Here's part of the story (chapter 33) when Jane Eyre finds out, through St. John, that they are her relations:<br>  "You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the same source?"<br>  <br>  "We are cousins; yes."<br>  <br>  "I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother:  one I could be proud of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the heart!- a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold:  rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled."<br>  <br>  and later, in the same chapter:<br>  "And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now:  you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?"<br>  <br>  So, she also refers to them as her brother and sisters.

A journalist has to be observant enough to find the stories that are out there to report on. If you cannot do either of these you will never make it as a writer. If you want ideas, go out into the world and observe. Take notes. Write down how people walk, talk, sit, eat, drink, whatever. Develop story ideas from that. Consider watching or reading 30 minutes of the news each day to come up with ideas and form some opinions.<br>  <br>  If your only source of ideas comes from someone else's mind and not your own you are in no position to be a writer.|`|hBA9ZbgRaa	Well, asking someone else for an idea isn't going to get you an "original" story. I suggest taking in things around you or experiences you've faced. Maybe even pulling ideas or writing techniques from fictional books you've read.<br>  <br>  And in the writing process, don't stop to edit or fix what you've written. The simple spelling errors are okay, but trust me: you aren't going to get a full story if you keep removing parts. In fact, those scenes you may have removed could be the key scenes later on. :)|`|5wg7tKc6aa	I want to write a book too, but that is why I'm taking University courses to learn the background information to writing a successful novel, and where to look for inspiration to begin writing.<br>  <br>  You should try finding your own ideas.

Add your own characters to that story - add twists - make it fictional - make it your own.  Ask the questions "Suppose...?" "What if...?"
WaJdOaFKaa	There is no "special" setting.  But you do need a tripod, or some means of supporting the camera with no movement throughout the exposure.  Just set the camera to a semi-automatic exposure mode like aperture priority, select a small aperture like f/22, then let the light meter do the rest.  It will calculate the best exposure for the light measured by it.  A lack of light, and the small aperture setting, the camera will set a fairly slow shutter speed automatically.  Good light streaks require at least 8 seconds.  At night, the exposure will usually be the same no matter where you are, or how much light you're getting from artificial light sources like street lamps and such.  I prefer using aperture priority as I can just dial down the aperture until I get 15 seconds or so, always at ISO 100.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Light streaks are pretty easy... just use a long shutter speed... the easiest way for a beginner is to set your camera to shutter speed priority, then choose different shutter speeds until you find the one that meets your expectations (if you're unsure, start at 1 sec to see if the streak is long enough for you, then adjust as needed).

31GXcmBiaa	All of the men on the monument did something that changed America in some way. Washington "father of our country".  Jefferson was the great expansionist who doubled the size of the united states.  Lincoln was the great preserver of the union.  Roosevelt was the perserver of our nations natural wonders.  It was Roosevelt, the great conservationist, who created the first national parks and saved thousands of acres of American forest.  He also created economic growth with the building of the Panama Canal.  Roosevelt was also credited with the strengthening of the U.S. Navy, which would be important after his administration during WWI.  He also started the idea of Big Stick Diplomacy.  The idea that your military show of force would be used to drive diplomatic relations.|`|yJXlvFfeaa	web site on that below.

OhWmu0R3aa	Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston was twice Prime Minister from 1855-1858 and 1859-1865. He was (and still remains) a highly popular and yet controversial figure in British political history as he followed an aggressive interventionist foreign policy, especially when involving the Empire. Examples would include the second opium war arising from a minor incident involving a British naval captain and the transferring of authority in India from the East India Company (who had been in charge for the previous 100 years) to direct Crown control following the Indian mutiny, enacted in the Government of India Act (1858).
SNKUdwRdaa	Hi! Before you go on your audition, you should stretch. I know this sounds silly, but it helps you loosen your body because they can tell if your tense and nervous. Try not to be too nervous, and even if you are, that's okay as long as you can switch over into a character that's not, if you have to act on the spot. While you are not acting, be yourself, but also be laid back. People get hired not only based on their talent and look, but their work ethic as well. They want to know that you are bookable.  Usually, the agent will meet your mother, but she will most likely not come in the room with you. Most agencies/people in the business think that moms and or dads can be distracting to the child, so she probably will not. However, this all can vary, as you will learn that you never know what's going to happen in show business. Speaking of that, you should be ready to do a short read of a monologue or you can look up monologues online. It would be great if you could memorize it. You should always be prepared. They might not make you do anything that you have already prepared. Instead they may have you do a "cold read" which is to read and execute a monologue/script on the spot. If this happens, don't get nervous, and don't rush. This is your audition time. On that note, break a leg!!!!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.<br>  J<br>  <br>  PS. Try to make sure your mom isn't "Stage Mom" ish. If she comes off as being jumpy, controlling, or annoying thats bad. A fair percentage of children are not chosen for jobs on account of their annoying moms.|`|uHPG6ETBaa	When they interview you, your mom will probably not have to be in the room with you (unless you want her to) <br>  They will probably want you to recite a monologue so they can see what you can do.<br>  <br>  Have Fun, and be yourself!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|x5dXU8vWaa	confidence is everything<br>  oh!, and also!<br>  a firm handshake 2!|`|cLKkbPPoaa	Just be yourself, be respectful, and don't speak unless spoken too! You normally can chose if you want a parent or they might suggest she stay outside for the privacy. They normally will look over your resume (if you have one) and they might ask you to perform a monologue! Don't worry! You will do fine! Good Luck Happy Acting Music_queen451|`|N8zJERG5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I'd advise you to prepare by memorising a great scene from a favourite movie of yours or something that they'll be familiar with.  Show them what you're capable of.  They might ask you to do a cold read from something that they'll give you so just be prepared, take your time to read it, absorb it, don't rush into it, keep your nerves under control - take a deep breath then perform.  You mum can stay with you but I think it'd show you're more confident if you stay on your own with them during the interview.  They'll ask what you've done so far and what you'd like to do so have a good answer prepared for them perhaps role play the interview with your mum.  If you have a resume with the body of work you've done so far and some great recent photos you can leave with them that would be great too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jx6L5t3Paa	Don't worry and just be yourself. <br>  Show them all the things you can do as far as acting goes. They don't really care about things that happened to you, or why you want to be an actress, they want to know how much potential you have.<br>  <br>  Also don't give into them, show them that your strong and confident. <br>  If they ask a question and you don't know the right answer think of something clever, and dont just say the first thing that comes to mind. think about it first. <br>  <br>  No, your mom doesnt have to be in the room, its your choice, if it were me id have her there with me, but only because she is more like a best friend than my mom. so it depends on your repaltionship. <br>  <br>  They most likely wont ask you to act on the spot, they usually say they will call, or get in contact with you. All depends on where you go, and their mood. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :DD|`|1faz0egMaa	Ive always wanted to with an acting agency, how did u get it??<br>  just keep going over your lines, i think you with have your mum outside but if u really want her to be inside supporting you, you could. x|`|55t9z5maaa	Wow That's Awesome Well Here's Some advice i have been through this before so believe me when i say its hard work So after you know that the acting agency isn't a scam they will probably let your mom into the room inless you say other wise and they might ask you to act on the spot it depends on the agency and when you go in the room make sure your smileing 24/7 and also make sure that when they ask you a question to always sa yes mam no mam yes sir no sir and one more thing make sure to have fun<br>  Have confidents and make sure to be your self
360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	I'm pretty sure that all of these answers are in the book and that having other people do the work for you won't help you learn anything. That being said...:<br>  <br>  1.) B - This one should have been obvious<br>  2.) A - Locke was a big fan of the people having the power over the Government<br>  3.) C - This is just something that should be memorized. A = John Locke, B = Thomas Hobbes, and D is Thomas Paine<br>  4.) C - This pretty much summarizes what he wrote in "Leviathan"<br>  5.) D -  The D is for "duh!" Paine hadn't even been born yet (and wouldn't be for another 200 years) and Aristotle had been dead for over a millenium. Also, you'll recall in 5th grade learning about all of the explorers from the time, so...<br>  6.) B - Galileo was a big fan. This question was a bit tricky and is more of a process of elimination if you don't know the answer for sure.<br>  7.) For the record: I don't like how this question or it's answers I worded. He did extensive work with studying the concept of an element (and also accidentally discovered Phosphorus), but he most certainly didn't "discover the elements." That being said, I have decided to go with 'B'. Mainly because I remember learning about his "corpuscular theory" in 'The Sceptical Chymist'.

Aziz tells him he would have told his wife that Fielding was his brother and allowed him to see her. He says that Fielding has behaved like his brother.

N86vHKxtaa	Generally, shipping of opposing nations is fair game for destruction at sea during a declared war, although civilian passenger ships are usually accorded some consideration to avoid unnecessary loss of life.<br>  <br>  The German government was certain that the ship carried "contraband" in the form of munitions and military cargo that made the Lusitania a legitimate target.  Look up the Lusitania and find the notices the german government ran in US papers warning people it would be sunk if discovered because it was carrying war supplies.  See PBS Online.|`|cYgJQDQSaa	The Lusitania was fitted to carry gun mountings (although guns were not fitted at the time) allowing her to be used as an auxiliary cruiser.  And it is believed that she may have been carrying munitions and equipment. Also, any vessel flagged as a British ship was technically open to attack. Germany had issued warnings to the US, regarding a possible attack.  The Royal navy had ships (known as "Q ships") fitted with concealed guns, that masqueraded as neutral vessels, in order to lure U-boats close enough to fire upon (against the rules of warfare).<br>  Interestingly, the only page missing from the admiralty logs of the period (covering orders/wireless transmissions) is the page relevant to the sinking.  Also, in the 1960's the wreck was routinely depth charged (supposedly it was an ideal training target).

iNXqiDIYaa	i assume you are talking about the Canadian Indian Acts<br>  <br>  there was not that many changes in 1951 itself but by then the original 1876 Act had been much amended - a list of the amendments with dates is<br>  <br>  1881: Amended to make officers of the Indian Department, including Indian Agents, legal justices of the peace, able to enforce regulations. The following year they were granted the same legal power as magistrates.[4] Further amended to prohibit the sale of agricultural produce by Indians in Prairie Provinces without an appropriate permit from an Indian agent.[4] This prohibition is, as of 2008[update], still included in the Indian Act though not enforced.[5] <br>  1884: Amended to prevent elected band leaders who have been deposed from office from being re-elected. <br>  1885: Amended to prohibit religious ceremonies (such as potlatches) and dances (such as Tamanawas dances)[6][7] <br>  1894: Amended to remove band control of non-natives living on reserve. This power now rested exclusively in the hands of the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs. [8] <br>  1895: Amended to outlaw all dances, ceremonies and festivals that involved the wounding of animals or humans, or the giving away of money or goods.[9] <br>  1905: Amended to allow aboriginal people to be removed from reserves near towns with more than 8,000 residents.[10] <br>  1906: Amended to allow 50 per cent of the sale price of reserve lands to be given to band members, following the surrender of that land. <br>  1911: Amended to allow municipalities and companies expropriate portions of reserves, without surrender, for roads, railways, and other public works.[10] Further amended to allow a judge to move an entire reserve away from a municipality if it was deemed "expedient."[8] These amendments were also known as the Oliver Act. <br>  1914: Amended to require western Indians to seek official permission before appearing in "aboriginal costume" in any "dance, show, exhibition, stampede or pageant."[4] <br>  1918: Amended to allow the Superintendent-General to lease out uncultivated reserve lands to non-aboriginals if the new lease-holder would use it for farming or pasture.[8] <br>  1920: Amended to allow the Department of Indian Affairs to ban hereditary rule of bands.[10] Further amended to allow for the involuntary enfranchisement (and loss of treaty rights) of any status Indian considered fit by the Department of Indian Affairs without the possession of land previously required for those living off reserve. Repealed two years later, but reintroduced in a modified form in 1933.[8] <br>  1927: Amended to prevent anyone (aboriginal or otherwise) from soliciting funds for Indian legal claims without a special license from the Superintendent-General. This effectively prevented any First Nation from pursuing aboriginal land claims.[4] <br>  1930: Amended to prevent a pool hall owner from allowing entrance to an Indian who "by inordinate frequenting of a pool room either on or off an Indian reserve misspends or wastes his time or means to the detriment of himself, his family or household". The owner could face a fine or a one-month jail term.[4] <br>  1936: Amended to allow Indian agents to direct band council meetings, and to cast a deciding vote in the event of a tie.[8] <br>  1951: Amended to allow the sale and slaughter of livestock without an Indian Agent permit. Status women are allowed to vote in band elections. Attempts to pursue land claims, and the use of religious ceremonies (such as potlatches) are no longer prohibited by law. Further amended for the compulsory "enfranchisement" of First Nations women who married non-status men (including Metis, Inuit and non-status Indian, as well as non-aboriginal men) thus removing their status and that of any children from the marriage|`|I12nj0M7aa	The treaty states that vampires (the natives call them bloodsuckers) cannot come onto their land.

Me6TBO71aa	a. trade with france
iNXqiDIYaa	there was no basic difference between the slave in the North and the South - they did whatever menial tasks their owners wanted and were generally very badly treated.  The big difference is that the North recognised that this treatment of fellow human beings was wrong at a much earlier date than the South and made life easier for the slaves and eventually abolished slavery whilst it was still rampant in the South.
MHphepQPaa	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Excuse me my English. <br>  <br>  The situation of France in the eighteenth century was of extreme social injustice at the time of the Old Regime. The third rule was formed by the urban workers, peasants and petty bourgeoisie trade. The taxes were paid only by this social segment in order to keep the luxuries of the nobility. <br>  <br>  The absolutist France was a country at this time. The king ruled with absolute power, controlling the economy, justice, politics and even religion of the subjects. There was a lack of democracy, because workers could not vote, nor give opinions in the form of government. The opposition were imprisoned in Bastille (prison policy of the monarchy) or sentenced to the guillotine. <br>  <br>  The eighteenth-century French society was stratified and hierarchical. At the top of the social pyramid was the clergy who also had the privilege of not paying taxes. Below the clergy, the nobility was formed by the king, his family, Counts, Dukes, Marquises and other nobles who lived in luxury at banquets and very cutting. The basis of society was formed by the third state (workers, peasants and bourgeoisie), as already said, held the whole society with its work and the payment of high taxes. Worse was the condition of life of unemployed persons increased extensively in French cities. <br>  <br>  The life of workers and peasants was of extreme poverty, therefore, wanted improvements in quality of life and work. The bourgeoisie, even having a better social condition, wanted a greater political participation and more economic freedom in their work. <br>  <br>  The French Revolution (14/07/1789) - The social situation was so severe and the level of popular dissatisfaction that so great was the people on the streets with the aim of seizing power and the government started the monarchy led by King Louis XVI. The first target of the revolutionaries was the Bastille. The Bastille Day on 14/07/1789 mark the beginning of the revolutionary process, because the prison policy was the symbol of the French monarchy. <br>  The slogan of the revolutionaries was "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity," he summarized very well the wishes of the third French state. <br>  During the revolutionary process, much of the nobility left France, but the royal family was captured while trying to flee the country. Prisoners, members of the monarchy, including King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette were slit in 1793.O clergy also not left unpunished, as the church property was confiscated during the revolution. <br>  <br>  In August of 1789, the Constituent Assembly canceled all feudal rights that existed and promulgated the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. This important paper brought significant social advances, ensuring equal rights to citizens, and greater political participation for the people. <br>  <br>  After the revolution, the third state begins to transform and parties begin to emerge with different views. The Girondist, for example, represented the high bourgeoisie and wanted to avoid a greater participation of workers in urban and rural policy. Furthermore, the Jacobins represented and defended the low burguesia greater popular participation in government. Led by Saint-Just and Robespierre, the Jacobins were also defended deep and radical changes in society that benefit the poor. <br>  <br>  Phase of Terror <br>  <br>  Maximilien de Robespierre: defense of radical changes <br>  <br>  In 1792, the radicals led by Robespierre, Danton and Marat take the power and organizing the national guards. They receive the orders to kill any opposition leaders of the new government. Many members of the French nobility and the opposition were sentenced to death in this period. Violence and political radicalization are the trademarks of this season. <br>  <br>  The bourgeoisie in power <br>  <br>  Napoleon Bonaparte: deployment of the bourgeois government <br>  <br>  In 1795, the Girondist assume power and begin to install a bourgeois government in France. A new constitution was adopted, guaranteeing the power of the bourgeoisie and expanding its political and economic rights. The French General Napoleon Bonaparte is placed in power with the objective of controlling the social instability and establishing a bourgeois government. <br>  <br>  Conclusion - The French Revolution was an important milestone in the history of our modern civilization. Meant the end of the absolutist and privileges of the nobility. The people gained more autonomy and their social rights have been respected. The life of urban and rural workers improved significantly. Moreover, the bourgeoisie led the process to ensure their social matters. The foundations of bourgeois society and capitalist were established during the revolution. The French Revolution also affected, with its Enlightenment ideals, the independence of some countries of Latin America and the movement of Inconfidência Mining in Brazil.

gW0nD5cEaa	Hitler was raised Catholic. Austria, where he was born was a largely Catholic country.  There is some dispute over whether he was a Christian or Catholic in adulthood. He was into the occult, apparently believed in fortune tellers and astrology, and many Christians would say that is not allowed if you are a Christian. <br>  <br>  I think he was a "Christian' if it was convenient. If he could get people to believe in him if they were Christians, then, yes, he was a Christian. If he was trying to get agnostics to go along with him, he probably said he wasn't a believer, or didn't say anything. <br>  <br>  He apparently based some of his hatred of Jews on the old, and hopefully outdated veiw that "Jews killed Jesus", which is totally wrong to begin with, a few did at the time of the crucifixion, but not all Jewish people and not for 2000 years. But some 'good Christians' apparently bought into the idea<br>  <br>  I don't think he was actually a "Satan Worshiper', he probably did not believe in anything, he more or less considered himself a 'god' and wanted others to, also. But he certainly 'followed' Satan, whether he did it on purpose or not, with all his hate and ordering people killed.<br>  <br>  Whether he 'practiced' a religion or not, or said he belonged to the Catholic church or any other, he did not follow the beliefs of any legitimate Christian church.|`|LPsmRI5Oaa	He was interested in the occult and Norse mythology, but he wasn't a "Satan Worshiper" I believe he had fundamentally Christian ideals.

Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels are a few that come to mind. <br>  <br>  P.S. Bravozulu... You said "No but he and Gerbils were obsessed with Aryian history and the occult."

gP11453Waa	Sure, I'd be delighted to share some memories. I shall stick mostly to the forties through sixties.<br>          I was born in 1946 in a small town in northern Wisconsin. WW2 had just ended, so that was a big topic of conversation and children's play. It was a large part of the culture of kids to play War, and though I certainly did my share of Pow-ing and Kablam-ing and being shot and blasted, I never really felt quite right about it. By the time I was ten, not long after the Korean War (uh, police action, conflict, or whatever you want to call it) ended, my own feelings had moved much toward the Peace sign, and I quite playing those games.<br>  <br>  We did play a lot of street games, though, such as Kick the Can, Red Light Green Light, frozen and poison tag, baseball (yeah, our street was pretty quiet--we played in the street), Captain May I? and Simon Says, Red Rover Red Rover, and several others. That means we actually WENT OUTSIDE TO PLAY! Every neighbor hood had its own "corner" grocery store, so we could easily just walk or run to get a snack (5-cent Hershey bars, etc.) or something the Moms needed for supper. We felt safe. Oh, we weren't supposed to talk to strangers, but really we felt and were safe.<br>  <br>  Probably the most unsettling moment of the fifties was when the USSR orbited Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957. It changed the mood of every neighborhood, every gathering, just everything. The first time the kids of our neighborhood saw it came within a couple of days of the launch. We were outside playing when that fascinating light glided across the sky. It seemed so threatening to so many people that one would have thought the Russians were going to drop all their atomic bombs on us on Saturday. This should not have surprised anyone, since the project was well-known as part of the IGY (International Geophysical Year), but the prevailing "wind" was that it should have been America, not Russia, that was first in space.<br>  <br>  Duck and cover nothwithstanding, it was the adults more than the kids who were really scared of the Soviet Union. Heck, I had a good time with my Hallicrafters 8R40 7-tube shortwave receiver when the Sputnik (and future satellites of USSR and USA) sent its steady beeping on 20.005 Megacycles (now called MegaHertz (MHz)) and at least one other frequency around 40 MHz, I think. The "chill" of falling behind the dreaded Russians changed into determination as our own space program got rolling. But there was still The Bomb, or many thousands of them. Back then only two countries had The Bomb, and look what the world has now. Even so, Civil Defense was big in society. We had to be ready for the Nuclear War that could come at any moment.<br>  <br>  Bomb Shelters had already gone up in many places, but during the late fifties and the sixties saw them become a booming (yeah, pun intended) industry. Most of us in our area believed that such a war would be horrible beyond description but that the shelters were mostly a reactionary device to calm the public's fears. I knew very few people who thought that if we survived the blasts, we would have anything worth emerging to face. Half Life came to mean pretty much no chance at life after the Big One. Still, the government was, uh, ready. The Post Office even had plans to deliver the mail. Mail? What mail?<br>  <br>  But there was a lot of fun, too. Indoor theaters and drive-in movies were really big during the fifties and sixties. When I was a little kid, we could do the Saturday matinee, complete with a double feature, at least one cartoon (sometimes several), and a serial short that would cliff-hang us back next week for the next episode. Some of the serials were Rocky Lane, Hopalong Cassidy, Tom Corbett, and Captain Video. Popcorn, candy, and drinks were always part of the event. How much did it cost? Well, at 14 cents for a ticket, one dollar would buy the whole afternoon and then some, with maybe enough for a malt or sundae one of SEVERAL ice cream parlors.<br>  <br>  By the mid-sixties I was about to finish high school and move on to college. Still alive and kicking were the aforementioned corner groceries. In our town of 8,700 there were no fewer than 12 of them. My favorites were Eddie's Flambeau Foods in our neighborhood (Eddie saved his banana spiders for me!) and Anne's Market, a small store in her boarding house, just a few blocks away, where we could go and talk to Anne and her residents, who congregated downstairs in and around the store area.<br>  <br>  Downtown was the place for shopping. There were no malls or anything resembling them yet, but that was soon to come, as were supermarkets, thus heralding the demise of the corner stores, none of which exist here today. There's just something uncozy about hanging around a 200,000 square foot super center. Our downtown is hanging on, but save for a few specialty shops it is diminishing for most retail purposes other than dining, drinking, banking, and lawyer-ing.<br>  <br>  Vietnam, of course, was the big topic of the sixties and early seventies, since we were still slaughtering our way through that mess. It seems we were at war an awful lot. We still are, yes? But Vietnam was different, it being the first war in which there was a tremendous groundswell of protest about the very nature of and reasons for the war. It was a time of confusion and stress, of wrestling with consciences, of not knowing those once well-defined boundaries of right and wrong. It was a time when college enrollments grew prodigiously, in no small part due to the Draft Deferment that came with being a full-time student. Many said it was an act of cowardice, but I think not in most cases, for the fear was real but not of going to war--of going to THAT war. Some of the music of the time came from Country Joe McDonald and his group. Joe, whom I was privileged to meet when we worked with him and Larry Long on a joint concert in Minnesota, was a Vietnam war veteran who became a strong spokesperson for the anti-Vietnam War movement. Larry, by the way, was a conscientious objector.<br>  <br>  Oh, I could go on about this sort of thing, but suffice it to say that the forties, fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties, and the current decade have been tainted by war. Even so, life goes on--differently in war zones, of course, than "back home."<br>  <br>  Cars? Ford Fairlane was popular, as were Chevrolet models, and virtually every American make and model. Japanese cars were just coming into their own on the American scene and would really secure a big market share after our own companies mangled the seventies and eighties. We wanted and got BIG cars with power and speed and bulk for, uh, safety. A notable exception was the Volkswagen Beetle.<br>  <br>  We had drug stores with soda fountains and grills, gas stations (before convenience stores really came along), corner stores, movies, friends' houses, parks, Downtown, Woolworth's, Ben Franklin, Newberry's, the A&W, Dairy Queen, and railroad yards. Some of the music was The Andrews Sisters, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, big bands, the explosion of 50's rock and roll, different rock in the sixties which really also gave new life to folk music, much of which was about peace and love. Glenn Yarbrough was and is among my favorites, but many others did their parts. Rod McKuen. Elvis, Buffy St. Marie, Joan Baez, Jefferson Airplane and all their names, Brothers Four, Kingston Trio, Chad Mitchell Trio (John Denver performed with them for a while), and many more.<br>  <br>  Video games were just beginning in the sixties, but pinballs were big, as were pool, billiards, Foos Ball, and several others. Going to the county fair was always a big thing to plan for the summer, and several small carnivals made the rounds every year, too. Circuses were still fairly common, such as Clyde Beatty's show. Then as now, skiing, tennis, baseball, swimming (in lakes, as we didn't even have a pool in town until the sixties, when the new high school went up, and it had almost no public time), fishing (yes, even through the ice), hunting, hiking, and deer watching were all popular outdoor activities.<br>  <br>  Television came along for us in the 1950's. My brother bought our first set, a used Hallicrafters 17-inch leather-upholstered black and white (color was still beyond our horizon) portable (meaning not that you could carry it by its handle but that one strong or two ordinary people could lift it onto a table or TV Stand). Our channel selection was channel 7 out of Wausau. Comedies, variety shows, and westerns were dominant, with news and movies (movies especially late at night) showing up a lot, too.<br>  <br>  Well, I had better stop now.

Don't worry what others think or say, remember it's not how others feel about you, it's how you you feel about yourself.

Fortunately, they're usually compulsory!<br>  At college, you can go on further with English, which will help your writing and comprehension but by then, you may find that there are better sets of A-levels or other qualifications that suit you - exactly what you want to write may change in the next 4 years.<br>  <br>  I can't answer the salary question as it is incredibly varied, depending on whether you work for a magazine or work for yourself submitting articles.<br>  <br>  If you have a school magazine, then try becoming a writer for that or find other free publications where you can submit articles, as these will give you a lot of experience...although a lot of that experience will be rejection! Don't give up - keep writing and reading, too!|`|J8xRVPulaa	I plan on taking many literature courses, creative writing classes, and if you want to be a journalist; take journalism courses. It's pretty obvious what you should take and what not.<br>  <br>  It depends which teen magazine, and which position you hold. An editor on 17 is going to have a very different pay than an occasional contributor to LA Youth.|`|SY9OaAwbaa	you dont need qualifications to become a professional writer. a guy called christopher paolini wrote a bestselling book when he was only 15 and is now a multimillionaire. but i suppose choosing english language and literature, media studies and a creative writing course couldnt hurt.|`|Vraywn6Vaa	You need to read a lot, but you must get a broad education, including maths and science. Essentially, your education is a different issue although without it you will find success hard in any field.<br>  <br>  There's a trend afoot suggesting that to write you have to have a Masters Degree in creative writing. There are publishers and agents who won't talk to you if you don't have the certificate. Nonsense, but another filter.<br>  <br>  In reality, you write because you have something to say and a story to tell. If you're good at it then think of it as another avenue.|`|3B31ZRSeaa	well, i am not sure about the teen magazine, but no particular course is need to become a writer; look at JK Rowling, she had no qualifications. I would suggest, however, to fortify your writing skills you ought to read lots and lots of books of all different genres, but in university you should probably take english language and literature and mybe drama.|`|YorMkZYAaa	With all due respect, by the time you would reach an age where you are qualified and experienced enough to work for a magazine, they will be a thing of the past. Unfortunately, magazines and newspapers are reaching an era where people rarely buy them in print these days. A majority of this material is already online and much easier to access.<br>  <br>  Focus on writing anything and everything for now. Take a lot of English classes in high school. Work on the school newspaper or yearbook for experience and a portfolio. There are no specific "subjects" you must learn to be a writer. You just write. Studying and firmly knowing mechanics and how to write well will be useful as will taking courses in creative writing, journalism, and literature.<br>  <br>  As for earnings, don't worry about that. You're 12. The last thing you should be concerned with is pay. Do what you want to do because you love to, not because of the money.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	English<br>  literature courses<br>  writing courses

4fdfdde77d4ab90611b82f1e76587a82aa	As a drama teacher, I can say that the ideas that come up most for the devised drama section of the GCSE are : bullying; teenage pregnancy; domestic violence and drug use/abuse. <br>  <br>  That is not to say that you couldn't or shouldn't touch any of these issues, but the external examiner will have seen about 50 other plays on the same subject. <br>  <br>  So - think about asking lots of 'what if' questions:<br>  what would feel be like being deported as an illegal alien from a land you'd lived in all of your life? <br>  what would it be like if your wishes really came true?<br>  what if you killed someone in a drunken fight and only remembered the next day?<br>  What happens when all of the lights go out in the toybox?<br>  What happens when all of the lights go out on the teenage popstar?<br>  What if the gardener found a door to another universe behind the old shed?<br>  What if that other universe was almost exactly the same as your original - except that you were king... or evil... or dead...or were never even born?<br>  <br>  <br>  .......and so on! Just play around with ideas.<br>  <br>  Just remember that each one of you in your group will need to get their own time 'DSC' (down stage centre) to show what you can do to the examiner... the more varied your part/s the better. So, for instance, in the 'alternate universe' example above, you play the mother of the main protagonist - but in two different ways. In one she is annoyed at son/daughter because of trouble they've caused... in the other universe you are shocked and disbelieve because he/she has been dead for two years in a car crash - a car crash that never quite happened in universe 1. Or you have never met her before because in Universe 2 you fell downstairs and mis-carried your first child - he or she was never born! <br>  This shows a little more variety in the characters you play - even though they look and sound the same. <br>  Ask your physics teacher about quantum mechanics and the 'many universes theory'.|`|6eOIigalaa	Im doing this XD<br>  Errm some ideas that came up in our class was<br>  <br>  Whats it like in a coma<br>  the 9/11 story but like on the plain<br>  Ones based loosely on premonition<br>  A school shooting<br>  Domestic violence at home<br>  Bullying<br>  Runaways<br>  How fame can destroy you<br>  Drug abuse<br>  <br>  There only basic ideas I could go on all day with many ideas in detail that were AMAZING but <br>  a)This is your project <br>  b) There's a character limit<br>  <br>  <br>   I've just realised how morbid all of our ideas are Lol

LVZdzPmpaa	Very few publishing companies will accept unsolicited manuscripts. As you can imagine, most publishers get literally thousands of manuscripts each month and have no one to read them, not to mention that most of them are unreadable.<br>  <br>  This is why most publishing companies will only agree to see agented work. That is the advantage to having an agent.<br>  <br>  The chances of an agented fictional manuscript making it to publication are about 1 in 5000.<br>  <br>  An agent serves as a middleman and a buffer. As such, he is expected to screen work and only represent the best, that which has a chance of catching the interest of a publisher.<br>  <br>  It costs nothing to engage an agent. Any "agent" who charges a "reading fee" or a "service fee" or any other sort of fee is running a scam, so beware.<br>  <br>  A reputable agent protects your interests and guides you through the complex and often nasty business of publishing. What is good for you is generally very good for the agent, but still you must be wise about the entire process.<br>  <br>  First, go to the public library Reference Desk and ask to see the Writer's Market, which is a directory of publishers (and other markets). You will find submission guidelines, represenation requirements, contact info, etc.<br>  <br>  Jeff Herman publishes an annual guide to agents that the Reference Desk may have on hand as well. If not, you can find a copy in the bookstore. Like the Writer's Market, the agent's guide gives info about which agents accept what kind of work and from whom, etc.<br>  <br>  Keep in  mind that in publishing, literary agents and publishers bear all the risk. Wanting to be published has no bearing on actually getting published. The agent will represent only writers that he feels can result in a sale, which is where his money comes from (commission). A publisher will only publish that which it feels will be profitable.<br>  <br>  You have a lot of research to do.  Start here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://anotherealm.com/prededitors/" rel="nofollow">http://anotherealm.com/prededitors/</a>|`|EkfyoMcuaa	I do not know any agents, but I do know is that if would be VERY VERY helpful to have an agent.

It doesn't cost you a cent to get an agent because an agent earns their money from the royalties an author recieves on book sales off the publisher. Usually an agent charges 15% off royalties.<br>  It's a matter of convincing an agent to accept your book in terms of readability, target audience and commercial value.<br>  Another thing would be that not all agents do all genres. If your book is a romance novel you have to get an agent who deals with that genre.<br>  They are usually members of press associations. You can look up in online directories.<br>  If an agent asks for money  before your book gets published that means he is a con.|`|695354591fcd4c8acf43d958f3d5442daa	An agent has the experience needed to get a publisher's attention. Go to the internet and type in Literary Agents, you will a list containing dozens of agent names. Learn how to compose a letter of query, and prepare a good synopsis of your story. Prepare for a lot of hard work and many no replies to advances to agents, but don't give up. If you get the interest of an agent do everything he requests of you. If any agent asks for money up front, have nothing else to do with that agent. Good luck.|`|nL8s4ozIaa	Advantages of agent: ur agent negotiates, you get a higher advance, even though 15% will go to agent. Its still better than publishing house taking advantage of you if you dont have one. Nowadays publishing houses wont even look at unsolocited writers- (ppl w/o agents)<br>  <br>  Go to agentquery to find the agent of ur genre. Generally agents will charge you to send mansucripts out. Most however wil not charge u if there are no offers. THey will deduct thier postage+copying fees from the 15% commision.
KHSOVxViaa	There is a quote by Winston Churchill:<br>  <br>  "Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat".<br>  <br>  El Alamein was the place in Egypt around which a major battle raged, causing severe damage to General Rommel's Afrika Korps and putting the German forces on the defensive.  It started on October 23, 1943.<br>  <br>  It's a simplification, but it is largely true.  1943 was the year that Germany started going on the defensive, and despite some local victories, it was downhill for them until the surrender in 1945.  German forces in North Africa got pushed back to Tunisia, then retreated to Italy.  Allied forces followed them and pushed northwards through the peninsula into southern Europe.<br>  <br>  D-Day was the opening of the second front in the west - it was a massive amphibious invasion launched from Britain, landing at Normandy in France.  After some time taken to break out, the allies surged through France to the German border, then a steady slog to victory.<br>  <br>  On the Eastern Front, the Battle of Stalingrad was the turning point.  Germany attacked the city, expecting a quick victory.  However, the Soviets put up a fierce resistance, bogging down their attackers.  They brought in reinforcements and eventually counter-attacked, cutting off a large German army which later surrendered.

AA12343309	I don't know what type of nitwit your teacher is but accurate genealogy isn't done fast.  It might take some people  10 years to get back to  great grandparents.  You can print this off and put it on his/her desk when he /she is out of the room. Documetation is the meat of genealogy.  <br>  If he/she ask you to find your "family crest," that will definitely be proof that he/she knows absolutely next to nothing about genealogy as well as heraldry.<br>  <br>  Don't expect to put a name in and find your family tree all complete and ACCURATE. If anyone has told you their Aunt Sallie has found their entire family tree online, please tell them if Aunt Sallie hasn't verified it with documents and records, they don't know if it is accurate or note.<br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50genealogy2008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family tree, particularly their One World Tree program.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I will back Shirley on the idea that your teacher is not being realistic at all, if she expects "family tree" to be something you can simply look up online. <br>  1- living persons and info are NOT ONLINE, AS it invades their privacy. No one outside of your immediate family has rights to personal facts. <br>  2- what she might be looking for is for you to sit down with your parents, and ask for their parents, and ask your grandparents for their parents. <br>  That is fine.. except millions of kids in America don't live with Wally and June Cleaver (Leave it to Beaver, an old tv show). Some kids have never met their father, or grandparents. Sometimes, with good reasons. Or you live far away from them and have no quick means to ask the information. <br>  I love genealogy with a purple passion. Teachers SHOULD NOT be using it as an assignment, since it puts many kids in an embarrassing situation. <br>  I hope you have a wonderful family, with none of these problems. Either way, your private life should not be the subject of a class assignment.|`|CLjWVveMaa	If you'er jr./H/S and need it fast-sounds like you,ve been delaying subject.If for collage credit-shame on you,but you start with you,your parents and grandparents& build upwards,birth date&place,marriage date&place.record death dates &places-there are free tree's you can down load-but you have to fill out.If your doing for collage you must have records of sourses used,you may end up enjoying the people you talk to-learning of your past,if your lucky stories,pitures-connecting to distant cousin-but fast isn't in the cards.For free trees state that weather you yahoo or google.Best of luck and hope you catch the genealogy bug.|`|c468479a04b10a58082559d803237157aa	never will get it "fast" but other person had it pretty much on the mark. city records,board of heath records, church records,family & family records all can help u find info. be warned the family name spelling could be changed any number of times. it is fun & interesting though. good luck. also more difficult if u r african american as records r more difficult to find.

In a clever, breezy first-person style, Spinelli tackles gender roles, family relationships, and friendship with humor and feeling. As the novel opens, Crash feels passionately about many things: the violence of football; being in charge; the way he looks in shoulder pads; never being second in anything; and the most expensive sneakers at the mall. Although a stereotypical bully, the boy becomes more than one-dimensional in the context of his overworked, unavailable parents and the love he has for his grandfather, who comes to live with the Coogans and then suffers a stroke. It is because of his affection for Scooter that Crash comes to appreciate Penn Webb, a neighbor and classmate whom for years Crash has tormented and teased about his pacifism, vegetarianism, second-hand clothes, and social activism. Penn relentlessly offers friendship, which Crash finally accepts when he sees Penn's love for his own great-grandfather as a common bond. The story concludes as Penn, named by his great-grandfather for Philadelphia's famous Penn Relays, wins the school race while the elderly man looks on.<br>  <br>  Plot/Problem:<br>  Crash Coogan and Mike Deluca are always picking on Penn Webb. Crash is very annoyed with Penn but Crash begins to realize he doesn't want to pick on Penn any more. Will he decide to stay friends with Mike or become friends with Penn??<br>  <br>  Later in the book there is a side plot. Crashes grandfather has come to live with him he tells many stories about his adventure is war. One day he falls from a tree and has a stroke. He doesn't remember anything. Will his grandfather be okay and be able to tell stories again?

They couldn't stand by while monarchies are taken over by the people.  Napoleon was at first just a general defending his country, his country gave him the crown to keep fighting for them.  When the other countries lost, Napoleon demanded land or reparations (don't trade with Britain) was a big one.  Napoleon simply defended his country and tried to enforce his winnings.  The fact that Britain outmaneuvered him diplomatically and the sheer numbers against him were unbeatable was his only downfall.  Napoleon was not only a great general but most of his plans for his country (had they won) would have revolutionized government as we know it.

03k5qduQaa	God is at war with Satan being so inspired by the Love and allegiance of his strong race to tackle the evil preying upon his creation. Satan is a cunning deceiver, weaves his deception through immoral women and weak men. God is a nobleman and dignitary and expects his creation to be as he. <br>  <br>  Satan laughs at Gods innocents’ gullibility and propensity to being led astray by Satan and his legion of aggrandised sinners. Satan accuses God of being all powerful by accident of birth. This is untrue as God is recognised is all wise, loving and noble souls as his Spirit. Satan applies sorcery and leads into temptation and ignominy any of Gods warlords willing to take up arms for their Creator and Father. Satan retaliated by political spin, unleashing suffering upon the blame via his governments and media and then casts blame upon religion, the divided House of God. <br>  <br>  God watches his five Major races and religions in hate and at war and is dismayed. Satan is emboldened and encourages division. Gods Lordship recognises the need to unite and are spurred to action. Satan harnesses this endeavour and the supplicated minds and hearts of the people to his own cause, stalking God to entrap the good God attracts by virtue of his nature, and through absolving of sins he has inflicted dons and becomes the benefactor of God’s grace. God is disheartened and abandons hope and his creation. Satan wins by treachery and magikery.  People and their world remains in varying degrees of hell. <br>  <br>  Many an army and league of Lordships have waged war and battled to extract mankind from this entangled web of illusion, treachery and falsehood and failed. Many Saints, Messiahs, Prophets were sacrificed, destroyed, broken at the altar of Satan and his feminist’s media.

Sometimes the evidence leads to such conclusions that we can't consider it, can't contemplate it - we have to turn back as if we've reached some uncrossable river.<br>  <br>  If God 1) exists, and 2) loves us, why then, for example, are we all sentenced to death, for starters?  And as you say, injustice, pain, suffering, little kids with cancer - <br>  <br>  If you can get past the "given" that God loves us, the answers that emerge are pretty stark - you know, and those other little nagging inconsistencies, like anything else you proposed that was real, but invisible and your special friend, you'd be locked up - etc.<br>  <br>  Tough questions to consider, for sure.|`|PBrDYFNwaa	Life is a class room where you learn by experience, all things that appear bad or good have other effects on life.

Life is not about justice but learning how to become part of every thing.  <br>  <br>  Don't expect people to like you just because you like them, relationships with people are like a jigsaw puzzle all the pieces have to fit together.

This is why some times some one looks great but when you get close to them you feel uncomfortable, your body rejects them as not suitable for you.

He seems to have a strange reluctance to show himself... too bad we could have used an omnipotent being showing up... any time in the last couple of millenia would have done.<br>  <br>  All that power... he could fix everything and stop suffering instantaneously, yet he doesn't. Oh, thats right he gave us "free will." Couldn't he have given us free will and cut short his lunch break to fix things that we've screwed up once in a while... after all we are not perfect beings (even though he created us - wow a perfect being making imperfect creatures... who would have thought!).<br>  <br>  Well, you know what they say - "God moves in mysterious ways."<br>  I wonder what "mysterious way" caused a friend of mine to have a heart attack and leave behind his eight year old son last week.<br>  <br>  So much for natural unwritten laws I guess.|`|52bb38389ace91aedab5837d20eb5996aa	unfortunately for now there are so many things that only God knows the answer to. however, many good things can come out of bad and God sometimes makes you go through things so we can see things we couldn't before. there not all comprehensible to us right away thats for sure. and maybe that girl just isnt the one.|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	there is no God.

hNinyCdBaa	As with any instrument in the same family, all the fingerings will be the same.  Personally, I have played alto clarinet since fourth grade and about a year ago (8th grade) started playing Bb, too.  The jump from those two clarinets is nearly identical to the jump between alto and soprano.  Your fingers will get a hang of the new position of the keys quickly, like a few weeks or so.  The harder part is the embouchure, which is much smaller than the alto.  As I said, I have been playing for a year, and I know that now I can play well on the Bb by now, but it took me at least six months until I was completely comfortable, but I was always better at low notes, everyone is different.  Personally, I would buy it, but it depends.  If you think you will be serious with sax in high school that would be a great thing to do.  It will get you a place in the higher band in your school (wind ensemble maybe?).  If you do buy it, know that there will not always be a soprano part, especially in the lower grades.  You will need to bring both saxes to class every day, and it is kind of annoying bringing two instruments from the locker room to band (though that might just be my school.)|`|xJCFgEneaa	The fingering for the notes will be the same.<br>  <br>  However, the feel of the instrument will be very, very different.  A soprano sax typically looks and feels more like a heavier gold clarinet than a curved alto or baritone sax.<br>  <br>  I think, though, if you're serious about the instrument, it would be a good buy.  Its always interesting and useful to learn something new.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

Regular people were just regular people living their lives, hoping for a better future, and not knowing the evils that would come, and not really having any way to do something about it after the unrelenting determination of Hitler to grab control (he did it through forming a coalition with some other political party, not by majority of German's votes!) and afterwards outlaw democracy and become a dictator.  (ps-- there were also so many political parties then, dozens of them, if you add up the votes for anyone other than NSDAP, they would be dust before they even started, absolutely not majority vote!)<br>  <br>  Just as another answerer said, why did Americans let George W Bush do what he did in Iraq contrary to world opinion and continue, with an upsurge even, when he was supposed to pull out?

Moreover, as desperate and humiliated as the German people were by the Depression and the terms of the treaty which had ended the First World War, Hitler and his Nazi party were actually quite popular among the lower class and middle class Germans.

OhWmu0R3aa	Firstly, Charles had married Henrietta Maria, the daughter of Henri IV of France who was a catholic. This left a suspicion amongst many of the Puritan elements within Parliament that she would influence Charles to turn England back towards Rome or at the very least convert their children, storing problems for the future.<br>  <br>  Mainly though, Charles was arrogant, conceited and a strong believer in the divine rights of kings. He had witnessed the damaged relationship between his father and Parliament, and considered that Parliament was entirely at fault. He found it difficult to believe that a king could be wrong. He was not prepared to concilliate, persuade or compromise and regarded all opposition as, by definition, treasonous. However, the House of Commons, understanding little of the problems of government, were equally unreasonable.<br>  <br>  From 1625 to 1629, Charles argued with parliament over most issues, but money and religion were the most common causes of arguments. <br>  In 1629, Charles copied his father. He refused to let Parliament meet. Members of Parliament arrived at Westminster to find that the doors had been locked with large chains and padlocks. They were locked out for eleven years - a period that became known a the Eleven Years Tyranny.<br>  <br>  Charles ruled by using the Court of Star Chamber. To raise money for the king, the Court heavily fined those brought before it. Rich men were persuaded to buy titles. If they refused to do so, they were fined the same sum of money it would have cost for a title anyway.<br>  In 1635 Charles ordered that everyone in the country should pay Ship Money. This was historically a tax paid by coastal towns and villages to pay for the upkeep of the navy. The logic was that coastal areas most benefited from the navy's protection. Charles decided that everyone in the kingdom benefited from the navy's protection and that everyone should pay. <br>  <br>  In one sense, Charles was correct, but such was the relationship between him and the powerful men of the kingdom, that this issue caused a huge argument between both sides. One of the more powerful men in the nation was John Hampden. He had been a Member of Parliament. He refused to pay the new tax as Parliament had not agreed to it. At this time Parliament was also not sitting as Charles had locked the MP's out. Hampden was put on trial and found guilty. However, he had become a hero for standing up to the king.<br>  <br>  Charles also clashed with the Scots. He ordered that they should use a new prayer book for their church services. This angered the Scots so much that they invaded England in 1639. As Charles was short of money to fight the Scots, he had to recall Parliament in 1640 as only they had the necessary money needed to fight a war and the required authority to collect extra money. In return for the money and as a display of their power, Parliament called for the execution of the Earl of Strafford, one of the top advisors of Charles. After a trial, Strafford was executed in 1641. Parliament also demanded that Charles get rid of the Court of Star Chamber.<br>  <br>  By 1642, relations between Parliament and Charles had become very bad. Charles had to do as Parliament wished as they had the ability to raise the money that Charles needed. Such a relationship was unacceptable to Charles. He went to Parliament with 300 soldiers to arrest his five biggest critics. Someone close to the king had already tipped off Parliament that these men were about to be arrested and they had already fled to the safety of the city of London where they could easily hide from the king. However, Charles had shown his true side. Members of Parliament represented the people. Here was Charles attempting to arrest five Members of Parliament simply because they dared to criticise him. If Charles was prepared to arrest five Members of Parliament, how many others were not safe? Even Charles realised that things had broken down between him and Parliament. Only six days after trying to arrest the five Members of Parliament, Charles left London to head for Oxford to raise an army to fight Parliament for control of England. A civil war could not be avoided.<br>  <br>  Sorry, i've rattled on a bit but I hope that helps.|`|swiOhDo2aa	The first answers are correct, if incomplete and rather tendentious. As so often in politics the real issue was money.<br>  <br>  The main problem was that Parliament (in particular the Commons) represented mainly the moneyed middle-class. Charles needed to raise taxes for the defence of the kingdom. Now, his power to raise taxes was circumscribed by custom (not actually by law) and he tried to collect from wealthy people - city merchants, landowners away from the coast - taxes which traditionally they had not had to pay (the famous ship money). These people not only hated paying their dues, they also wanted more power (some things never change!)<br>  <br>  The problem with calling a parliament to authenticate this necessary revenue was twofold: they might have refused to do it, and they might have passed laws giving themselves more, and the King less power. Hence the period of royal rule, and the disagreement between Charles & the parliament.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|FB596WDCaa	The other two repliers were right; Charles I not only invoked "Divine Right", but at various times he refused to call Parliament into session, he even dismissed Parliament.<br>  He married a Catholic, triggering fears that England would turn "Papist".<br>  At his trial, he called for a dismissal of all charges against him, because commoners had no authority or right to try a king.  The executioner's axe disagreed with his defense, and chopped his head off.|`|GHefTsUyaa	Claim the divine right of Kings!<br>  Don't worry Oliver will sort him out!|`|12ada22f13928c9aaae148495bdcdf87aa	He didn't call Parliament, relying on royal decree.

A 1955 version recorded by 'Tennessee' Ernie Ford was on the b-side of his cover of the Moon Mullican standard, "You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry". However, it was Ford's "Sixteen Tons" that reached number one in the Billboard charts, besting the performance of the competing version by Johnny Desmond. Another competing version by Frankie Laine was released only in the U.K. where it gave Ford's version some stiff competition on the charts.

z4Yeofq8aa	Lots of different factors. Britain was an insular country with short lines of communication and lots of canals linking the towns and cities and that stimulated industry and commerce. It was also extremely wealthy due to its empire which brought in raw materials like cotton and there was money available for continuous investment in new industrial technology like mechanised cotton looms etc. Also it was the first country to develop the steam engine and utilise it to power machinery in factories which meant that in a very short space of time Britain had advanced far ahead of her competitors.|`|GHefTsUyaa	A huge and fairly sudden advance in technology,science and engineering.

WshwHtk9aa	Technically, no we don't, and it doesn't matter. <br>  <br>  Red doesn't truly label the color of the light as you perceive it to be, but the wavelength of light as it actually is--and that is the same for everyone. If a beam of light reflecting of a stop sign is of a certain wavelength, it IS that wavelength (red), whether you perceive it and interpret that wavelength in your own mind as appearing black, red, green, or plaid. <br>  <br>  We already know for a fact that people see colors differently. Take color-blind people, for example. For those that "can't see red," there isn't just a void in space and time where the color red would be. They still see the red stop sign, but their brain interprets it as a color other than red. We already know this to be fact.<br>  <br>  Regardless, of how their brain and my brain and your brain "interpret" the colors coming off the sign, though, it is only sending out one wavelength of light, which denotes its true color. <br>  <br>  Here's one for you, though, if there is no light at all, no light to be reflected, absorbed, or emitted--pitch, total, utter darkness--would a red sign still be red at all?|`|Q8fcepcZaa	im just having a stab in the dark here but how about shining, say, red then blue light of a pure wavelength into a bunch of people's eyes and monitoring their brain activity, then comparing the brain scans?<br>  <br>  if two scans show the same brain activity in two people, then is that proof?|`|DHiqm9Ojaa	I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WONDERING THIS!!!

I ran into it in a much more mundane setting recently.<br>  <br>  I downloaded some smiley faces for Yahoo Messenger that were adult rated.  I thought it would be funny once in a while to use one.  So I send one to this friend, it usually is the tongue sticking out, but on my screen it showed as the guy turning around and mooning you.  So I mooned this friend of mine and she mooned me back!  I thought well you rascal, how long have you had that?<br>  <br>  She said, oh forever.  Oh, ok.  Really?  She didn't seem the type.<br>  <br>  Turns out, when you download those things, they only show on YOUR screen and not the other person's, whether you're sending them or receiving them.  So I though she was sending moonies because I was seeing moonies, but she was seeing the usual symbol on her end.  It took some luck and intelligence to figure out this was happening, cause I'd keep seaying "did you see that" and she'd say yes, of course, here it is back to you, but it would be two different things.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds a bit silly, and wordy, but it was profound too - we were sending language signals back and forth and seeing different things - how would you ever know?|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	We must remember, too, that we're not necessarily just talking about ocular organs here.  While we certainly do have different capabilities in that regard, there is also a lot of neural processing of images that goes on, even with simple colours.  If you haven't read it, Sacks' "An Anthropologist on Mars" has some great chapters on what can happen if something goes awry with that neural processing.<br>  <br>  So to tell is we're having the same colour experiences, we'd not only have to see the same thing but through their eyes, we'd have to see it through their brain as well.  No small feat.<br>  <br>  But I don't think it's a necessarily impossible one, even if it is one we're nowhere near accomplishing yet.  It is not inconceivable that a future society might be able to intercept signals in your brain and alter or re-route them.  In a very primitive sense, this is what a lot of our neurophamacological drugs do now.  Perhaps with the right kind of equipment, our successors will be able to simulate any kind of experience, even those of each other.  They alone will be able to actually answer this age-old conundrum.<br>  <br>  Maybe even sooner than we think.

If she is a well known and well established photographer in your area, then it IS possible that she has had some kind of delays in processing the photos...but 10 weeks is UNACCEPTABLE. I have taken hundred of wedding photo assignments, and SELDOM does it take me more than 2 weeks to deliver.<br>  Play her little waiting game for another 3 or 4 weeks. If she delivers demand a discount. A 50% discount would not be asking too much. If she refuses, accept the photos and take her to small claims court to sue for the balance...meaning that you'de be asking for a refund of $1,350. ...or whatever the judge orders.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	A registered letter stating your discontent would be your next step.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Tape your conversation with her while asking for compensation and/or discount.  If she refuses, take her to court and sue her for breach of contract.  You should still receive your photos and court should force her to give discount
LVZdzPmpaa	You cannot copyright ideas.<br>  <br>  You can copyright a script, novel, story, artwork, music, lyrics, etc.<br>  <br>  There is no form and no fee. If you create a "work," it is copyrighted and thusly protected from the time it is created. You don't need to file special papers or pay anything.<br>  <br>  The Library of Congress does not catalog "ideas."<br>  <br>  It sounds like what you have created is a "treatment." The contents of the treatment are protected under copyright, but your idea is not.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that all novice writers believe that their ideas are going to be stolen. Most people believe that their own ideas as so spectacular, they wouldn't spend any time stealing from anyone else. There are no roaming bands of Idea Thieves on the loose.<br>  <br>  Cultivate your ideas further. Develop a script. That way you have something to copyright as proof of your ideas.<br>  <br>  The notion of mailing something to yourself went out in the mid-1970s. It is the mark of a misinformed amateur and is a pointless exercise. Plus, I would be leery of anyone who claims to be a "lecturer at my university" who can't spell "copyright."|`|YorMkZYAaa	Mark of an amateur my friend, mark of an amateur.<br>  <br>  Nearly every amateur with a so-called great idea thinks someone is going to want to steal it. That couldn't be further from the truth. Instead of worrying about whether someone will steal your idea why not actually get to writing it down and doing the work? <br>  <br>  Your work is protected by intellectual copyright as soon as you write it. There is no need to do anything further such as spending (wasting) money on paperwork that is completely unnecessary. Another myth that will get you absolutely nowhere is to mail it to yourself. This is known as poor man's copyright and will not hold up in a court of law. Don't even think about trying it.<br>  <br>  And for the record, there is a difference between COPYRIGHT and COPYWRITING. Please learn them.|`|wtdic2w7aa	You can't copyright ideas.<br>  <br>  You can only copyright a finished product (eg, a manuscript, film script etc); but in most countries work is automatically copyrighted as soon as you create it. In the US you can register your work with the copyright office (though it's not necessary-if you don't do this your work is still copyrighted). The easiest way to protect your copyright is mail a copy to yourself and keep it in a draw sealed in an envelope; this establishes when it was created should you ever need to prove it.|`|xVNKSaGHaa	I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  BUT a cheap and quick way to copywright work is to seal it in an envelope and post it to yourself. Do not open it when delivered, file it away. The postmark will act as proof of copywright as its dated.

cFiOTJ7jaa	No. It doesn't have a simile at all.<br>  <br>  "It's hard to find a perfect breeze, a perfect sky, or a perfect night. But the hardest perfection of all to encounter is your friendship."<br>  <br>  There's no likeness here - only unlikeness. The friendship of "you" is compared to the perfect breeze, perfect night, and perfect sky - and "your" friendship is more perfect than any of them. Things are only "less/more perfect than...", never "as perfect as...".|`|AA10504458	I think its beautiful .if it has a simile or not|`|ea2c09a93f92d7f85f71f746000cb318aa	Nope.|`|b358e6e072558af769b0e23bbef76c14aa	The simile that I found was the authors likening the friend to perfection, a "treasure" found. The friendship has been equated with perfect breezes, skies and nights, yet remains with its own identity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Similes allow ideas to remain distinct in spite of their similarities.|`|Rqt2DRzSaa	no. There is nothing being compared at all in the poem.|`|0KDwifgGaa	I can't find find one to be honest.

It's not bad, especially if you look at this guys art: <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kanada" rel="nofollow">http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kanada</a> Most furry art is less adult than bugs bunny. I love it personally. If you like it, then don't let people tell you it's bad, masturbation itself is frowned upon, but it doesn't matter what you masturbate to.|`|rapUEDeqaa	It's fine if you like it, and no it is not beastiality.

k8uiZYfjaa	it's mostly the lighting that makes people look unattractive in photos<br>  when you are looking in a mirror, its either in a bathroom, where the light is softer, or just somewhere with soft lighting<br>  <br>  when a photo is taken, it freezes what you look like at a specific point in time which isn't very attractive most of the time. <br>  <br>  you can be sexy yet not look good in photos;<br>  <br>  take david tennant (:D) he doesnt exactly look amazing in pictures, yet he is generally very sexy<br>  <br>  if you look good in a mirror, the chances are that you look good generally<br>  but if you have bad self image, then you might think you look terrible when you dont... this is what happens to people with anorexia... (i think what they get is called body dysmorphia .. or something .. not sure of the spelling)<br>  <br>  when you see yourself generally, (in a mirror/photo) it is not what other people see you as... not sure why... but everybody else sees you different to what you see yourself<br>  <br>  anyway<br>  try not to worry what you look like all the time, just be happy and let your personality shine through<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  sorry about the lack of capital letters :P<br>  <br>  xxxxxxx|`|WNuxNjeOaa	You are used to seeing yourself in the mirror, which is backwards from the way you really look.

4A7uVacFaa	Do some research on the "Democratic Peace" theory, which holds that liberal democracies do not conduct wars against each other.<br>  <br>  To answer your question you really need to define democracy. For example, the United States is NOT a democracy, and certainly wasn't a democracy, as it is usually defined, for much of its history when women and minorities couldn't vote. <br>  <br>  I don't know that there is an instance of two liberal democracies, where all citizens have a vote in free and fair elections, have gone to war. <br>  <br>  If you question doesn't involve a direct conflict, then I'm not sure how values are passed to enemies other than by coincidence. There have been a lot of failed democracies in Southeast Asia, so you might do some case studies there.|`|8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	"Germanic tribes destroyed Rome but Germany is today a democracy of sorts"<br>  <br>  Sure, but 1,500 years interceded the fall of Rome and the development of Germany into a democratic nation. There's no direct link there. Besides, Rome wasn't democratic when it was destroyed.|`|N86vHKxtaa	Germanic tribes destroyed Rome but Germany is today a democracy of sorts.  An example that presumes the fall of western civilization is not a good one.
zxQT3Uo5aa	I liked it but had to consider past into present and frown in the present.<br>  Since this is so short and simple, you need to work on these two not because the reader does not get it but because it is too much of a distraction in an otherwise perfectly stated thought.  Also, there is a directional issue with these on what comes first that is not an issue with the other lines.  With them, it is no longer "clean or smooth".|`|2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	I like your idea, like your concept of 'gone.'   I do like it, if evokes such a sense of loss.  My comments are only to offer editing for potential improvement if that's what you are hoping to achieve.  If you just want to know if we like it, then I do.There are two lines that don't work for me.  <br>  Like the past in the present<br>  Like a frown in the pleasant<br>  <br>  Like the past in the present doesn't reflect 'gone' but infers it is here, when you are saying everything else about it being gone. Try reversing your words to Like the present in the past.<br>  <br>  Like a frown in the pleasant doesn't seem as clear as all the other lines.  It needs to reflect something going, something gone or barely there,  Like a smile faded fast.<br>  <br>  And one last thing, are you talking about a man, or Him?  I would look to consider reversing the last two lines depending on who you are speaking about.|`|3SNhXpf0aa	I like it. What is it about though? You should possibly have more lines before the "and then he was gone", to indicate what it's about.|`|Rqt2DRzSaa	left me speechless. Don't change a thing. I can even explain how much I love it.
