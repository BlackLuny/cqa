cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	I do not know of any camera today that is only 10 MB. Most hold multiple GB. Are you referring to 10 mega pixels? That would have nothing to do with the capacity.<br>  <br>  To figure capacity divide the memory size by the mega pixel size. For example a 2GB memory on a 10 mega pixel camera would be<br>  2,000,000,000 / 10,000,000 = 200 at the highest resolution. If you take pictures at a lower resolution you can store more pictures.<br>  <br>  I get about 400 on an 8 megapixel camera with 2GB memory.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?
bXCqndxwaa	lol...<br>  mine was a time in high school in the hallway when i thought i saw my bf and i ran up to him and huged him but it was some other guy who i didnt even knew... that was sooo embarrasing hehe...|`|KEUuLH3zaa	awesome|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	i almost fell on stage while performing in front of hundreds of people. :/|`|jvh9egWQaa	This one time I was at school with my boyfriend (we're both 14) and I was kind of getting over a cold. Kinda. So we were standing in the hall way together just hugging and hanging out when all the sudden he decided to say something really funny. So of course,   I started to laugh hard but then snot from my nose came out! But thats not the worst part, it came out on his cheek! It was extremely embarrassing! But luckily, instead of him being totally disgusted, we both just laughed about it:D|`|qtdNwpd1aa	Haha, its good to laugh it off, remeember u you went to a beach somewhere u dont live, you actually think somebody gonna remember you? if u stayed wid ur bf just keep reminding him "im sure u liked that moment" haha, its always good to laugh it off :-)<br>  <br>  -Veronica.B|`|4qiiuv6Xaa	One time I when I was like five I don't know what I was thinking, but I was wearing my neighbors dance tutu and I was in my room and my mom comes in and sees me there wearing it.

BKjnDG99aa	when group owners promote members to moderators, that mod is there to help that group run per what the owner wants and expects. many times an owner doesn't realize or expect a mod to get take-over attitude, so they just never set out their expectation or limitations to that mod. <br>  the owner doesn't have to ban the mod, just select different moderator privileges or just bump them back to member status. the owner should look at what privileges they have given that moderator. if they gave them full privs, they can delete the group and that often ends up happening when one gets a Big Head. don't give them the privilege of approving new members, then that mod cant know when some one joins. <br>  <br>  the biggest thing is what the members are telling the owner. what makes a good group is the members and some new members just want to get the feel of the group before they post than to have a post directed right at them. I have support groups and would never address a new member until they posted first.<br>  <br>  a good set of group rules can help- one of ours is not off-list e-mailing unless the other is receptive to it. the only time my moderators e-mail members off-list are for specific reasons. it sounds like this moderator is trying to be a friend to all and just doesn't see they're being pushing and members are not being receptive to them.
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to refer to a photo on Yahoo Answers you must upload it to a photo site. Three examples are Photobucket, Flickr, and TinyPic. You then post the complete address, including http://, in your question or answer.<br>  <br>  For Photobucket copy the "direct link" under the photo and paste into your question or answer.<br>  For Flickr click on "all sizes" above the picture then copy "Grab the photo's URL" at the bottom.<br>  For TinyPic use the "Direct Link for Layouts".<br>  <br>  NOTE: Do not post a picture and ask if the person is pretty or to rate them. That is considered chatting and is a violation of the guidelines.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You cannot add the photo directly to the question. However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.|`|53FA3PSNaa	Go to the web page and get the URL. A URL is a web page address it will have ( HTTP:// ) at the beginning of the address and is located near the top of the page. To get the URL left click on it one time, it will turn blue, then right click on it and select Copy. Open the question box and right click on the body of the box and select Paste.<br>  <a href="http://domainbean.com/2008/03/30/url-pri..." rel="nofollow">http://domainbean.com/2008/03/30/url-pri...</a>|`|ZyoBaEIWaa	you put the url<br>  or the code|`|NWvYLRPnaa	u just show a link of the picture

At age 46, I finally met my husband on<br>  <a href="http://www.plentyoffish.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plentyoffish.com/</a><br>  We have been married for 3 wonderful years now.  I did have to throw back a few fishes before I found my keeper, but it was a fun experience and I got my man out of it.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  BE HONEST on your profile.  If you tell lies then you start a relationship on lies and it is doomed from the start.  With honesty you get someone who wants you for the you that you are and not for what you are not.

Z4QbQt3Xaa	Try Business & Finance|`|p3nng9T3aa	There is a mathematics section.  If you were asking bout software, then you should stick in the computer section.  There probably just wasn't anyone one YA who was familiar with that program at the time that you posted your question.  Be patient or ask again by wording it differently.
7u77AiBjaa	There's no link to your 360 space in your question or Y/A profile, so I can't easily verify that you have uploaded your picture correctly. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

PDB2YbA4aa	Dear N,<br>  <br>  Points are for keeping track on how far you've gone on Answers. There are many ways on how to get and lose points. First of all, by logging in, you get 1 point (only works once a day). This may not sound like much, but these points will build up in time. Also, by voting for a best answer on a question that is open for voting, you can get a point for each vote. Also, write good answers, as each "thumbs-up" on a best answer also brings one point. This works until you get 50 "thumbs-up" ratings on your answer. Any more will not be counted. This leads to answering questions. Each answer you give earns you two points. If your answer gets picked as the best answer, you get 10 points! Now for the deductions. Asking a question deducts five points. Deleting an answer takes back the two points you earned by deducting two points. If you choose a best answer for your question, you get three points back. Also avoid getting reported, or you'll lose 10-12 points per violation. So be careful for those deductions, and work towards those points!<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Blaziken|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	The yahoo answers point system has been instituted by the administrators to give a motivation for people to answer questions on the site. Think about it: if their was no motivation for users to limit the amount of questions they ask, and answer that of others, yahoo answers would be pointless. People would post, but no one would answer. The asker would post, only to later on be disappointed in finding out that no answers have been given. Users would lose purpose, quit, and pretty soon, yahoo answers would be an unused service. You can thank the point system for the answers that you will receive on this very question.<br>  <br>  The point system for yahoo answers is pretty simple. Basically, for every question you answer, two points are added to your count. For every unresolved question that is in voting, you can gain a single point by voting for a best answer. However, be weary of the amount of questions you post. For each question asked, 5 points are deducted.<br>  <br>  As you gain points, you will increase your Y!A level. Y!A has a system of seven levels. When a user begins the service, they start at level one, and are given 100 points to get them going. Once your point count exceeds 250, you move up to level 2. At 1000 points, you become a level 3. This system goes on until you gain 25,000 points, making you a level 7.<br>  <br>  Level 1: 1 - 249 points<br>  Level 2: 250 - 999 points<br>  Level 3: 1,000 - 2,499 points<br>  Level 4: 2,500 - 4,999 points<br>  Level 5: 5,000 - 9,999 points<br>  Level 6: 10,000 - 24,999 points<br>  Level 7: 25,000+ points<br>  <br>  For each level increased, you will gain rewards that you can use to improve your influence on yahoo answers. For example, once you reach level two, you gain the ability to rate answers with a thumbs up or a thumbs down. You will be able to answer and ask more questions per day as you get a higher level, and once you reach level five, you will not be limited to the amount of questions you can answer and ask.<br>  <br>  For more information on the yahoo answers point system, see this link: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AtIrPstAwZrfT7XsQOY56Hjpy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|53FA3PSNaa	This link will give you the details of the points. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AgwSi4mEgFXVN2HMH2qJDpf59xd.;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>  <br>   As for me I do not really care about the points. My reward is in helping others. Like when when someone left a note saying Thanks that was quite informative.|`|Un4atme7aa	just leveling up and stuff

VQdqogD7aa	There are many ways, but the simplest is to click the big red Y on the Yahoo! Toolbar or go to yahoo.com.  The top line (near the left) of the Yahoo.com webpage has the words Make Y! your home page.  Click those words.

Click on the button near the top that says EDIT INFO.<br>  <br>  3. You should see three boxes. All the way to the right, there should be a box that says "Use my Yahoo! Avatar", and then right beneath a button that says "Edit My Yahoo! Avatar". <br>  <br>  4. Click it.<br>  <br>  5. It will take you to the link.<br>  <br>  OR...<br>   <br>  Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage. Make sure you're logged on. =)<br>  <br>  CUSTOM AVATAR:<br>  <br>  You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on “Edit My Info”. If you haven’t created your avatar, at the top of the page, under “Nickname” is a line that says “Use my 360 nickname”. If you have not created your 360 profile, there will be a link next to it that says something like “Get my 360 profile now!” Click on it; it will be the easiest to use for the below.<br>  <br>  Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. Remember, it has to be in the JPG format, and it must be 5 MB or less. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient.<br>  <br>  To get it to show up…<br>  <br>  1. Go to your profile<br>  <br>  2. Click "Edit My Info"<br>  <br>  3. You will be taken to a page where you will see three boxes. One says "No Picture" underneath the box, one says "Use My 360 Picture" underneath the box, and one says "Use My Avatar" underneath the box. Check the circle next to the one that says "Use My Avatar" or next to the one that says "Use My 360 Picture". Whichever one you want.<br>  <br>  4. Scroll down.<br>  <br>  5. Click "Preview"<br>  <br>  6. Click "OK"<br>  <br>  7. You're done.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to post a picture into a question, you cannot add the photo directly to the question. However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped! Good luck!<br>  <br>  =)|`|1CABRATlaa	You need an image host this converts your images into urls.  I use Screen Dash.

a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	Yes, especially if im asking a question that I dont know that answer to at all.<br>  <br>  When they use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, it makes me think that they know more about what they are saying.|`|L1FUcmb0aa	Definitely. A person who uses proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation (omg you spelled punctuation wrong!) makes a person look more refined in speech and knowledgeable. Part of your accepting an answer depends on the respect you can feel for the person in a response. When I was answering a question regarding a person's weight and form, several people shared my opinion that she was not fat, but she chose my answer as the best because my response was simple, to the point, and polite. This type of response gives a sense, at least I would think, gives a sense of respect for the person. Now, a mechanical error may detract from the respect a bit, and that is why you are more likely to choose something with proper form as the best answer. Only a thought with a really powerful essence, I think, would remove the swing factor of a mechanical error.|`|SSD3jj7baa	I think it all depends on the question really.  If you think about it, the question you may have asked could have resulted in a long answer that could be more prone to spelling or grammar errors.  Sometimes I think that people are in a hurry to answer the question too, thinking that the first correct answer get awarded the points.|`|2ImIgJwXaa	Definitely.|`|Uv8TBb1Uaa	hahahaha yes:)|`|GOKNG35daa	What you tink?<br>  it depends in the quchtion that was actsed.

suPD7c3gaa	Just keep answering a lot of questions in ONE category. Answer only quality questions with helpful, informative quality answers to give you a better chance at getting Best Answer for your answers. The exact formula isn't publicized, but it's rumored we need to answer approx. 50 questions in the one category in a 30-day period, and of those answers, get 10% best answers. You'd have to maintain that balance of Best Answers to total answers to keep the Top Contributor badge once you get it. You can be Top Contributor in up to 3 categories.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Find 1-3 categories that you would enjoy spending a lot of time in and have a bit of knowledge in.

Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.

If people were allowed to ask unlimited questions, then they'd ask so many questions they'd use up their points. Yahoo wants people in levels 1-4 to answer more than they ask; that's why you're alllowed 20 answers in level 1 and only 5 questions.<br>  <br>  And the reason they limit the amount of answers per day is because they are trying to discourage point gaming.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|fb83cf0d9efbb8c23d7795e6536ba9e0aa	to give equal opportunity to everyone to "level up" or whatever.<br>  <br>  im not interested in the levels per se, but oh well...

c316178951b8605e913804fde0cb6becaa	I think the ones that state that everyone must be polite are good ones.<br>  <br>  But I think the ones where they are after people who are point-gaming, or that are picky over the way a person words a questions are a bit ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Number one, who cares if a person is point gaming - let them waste their time and see all of yahoo's ads.  Besides which, just because the person technically answered the question doesn't mean they're actually positively contributing to Y!A.  One only has to visit the Religion&Spirituality and Politics sections to see that.<br>  <br>  Number two, if someone asks how do you do something and Y!A says it's a violation because they were asking for personal information, I'm sorry, that's beyond anal.<br>  <br>  And my final complaint, it'd be nice if Y!A actually had someones to review questions and answers before giving them a violation notice, instead of just doing it whenever someone reports.  Like look to see if the reporter has been reporting the same user over and over, etc.<br>  <br>  For example, take a look at this user:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt=AiPmxfZce9Dd._mZsks.KtDd7BR.;_ylv=3?show=q0gRmHlUaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt...</a><br>  His avatar is a picture of a leader (Thomas S. Monson) of the LDS church that he has manipulated to look like an ape, and then played on the name to reflect the picture.  But Y!A for some reason has not put a stop to it (despite several people that have reported it).  <br>  <br>  Yet they pull answers for declaring a person like the above a troll or for being too specific in their question (example: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApuSKrXQfFfP1NJt2BzUHp_59xd.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307182432AAq5hAr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> ).<br>  <br>  While I think Y!A is trying, they have a long way to go to make the Community Guidelines work half way decently.|`|AA11408911	The Yahoo!

Now drag and drop or copy and paste the pictures from the cell phone into the folder you just made.

AA11307940	Yahoo has been experiencing technical difficulties for awhile now, they have been doing maintenance and upgrades to their sites causing problems for all of us. I have had a multitude of problems the last few days. Today is ok so far.
2F5XkiHLaa	That's when Yahoo updates their products, be it mail, chat, messenger, whatever, with product or security improvements, or just changes something<br>  .
6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on “Edit My Info”. If you haven’t created your avatar, at the top of the page, under “Nickname” is a line that says “Use my 360 nickname”. If you have not created your 360 profile, there will be a link next to it that says something like “Get my 360 profile now!” Click on it; it will be the easiest to use for the below.<br>  <br>  Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. Remember, it has to be in the JPG format, and it must be 5 MB or less. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient.|`|iHMbg6d6aa	To change pic : <br>  <br>  Click your picture or go to your profile -either way you need to be on the profile. Click edit my profile info in the little blue box.
f1beDbKIaa	There are odd length limits in Y!A, for both questions and answers.  And discussions have odd limitations.<br>  <br>  Another issue is the quality of the feedback you might get.  If the average age of people who post is 13, the average age of people who answer is only 14 or so.  There are just a few deviants who are both older and more mature.  Yes, it's the older and more mature ones who are the deviants.  I mean, what are they doing hanging out with 13 year olds?  It's not the 13 year olds who are at fault.  What do they know?  And so, thank the stars for the deviants.<br>  <br>  That said, feel free to send me a Y!A note via email.  I'll send you my real email.  Then you can write books, and i'll critique them honestly, which is to say i'll make you cry if i can. And i'll have fun doing it, even if i have no idea how many tissues it takes. I promise that you'll get the full attention and English expertise of a deviant engineer.  You know about engineers, right?  "I always wanted to be an engineer, and now i are one."  I'm not making this up. I had to memorize this to graduate.  I'm only supposed to know math, Newtonian physics, Math, a bit of chemistry and MATH. So, engineers are also polymaths.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	If all you're looking for is to have grammar and punctuation corrected, things like that, yes you can.<br>  <br>  Try Homework Help or Words and Wordplay unless the subject matter is something technical that the average person wouldn't understand.  Then it would be better to post the question in a related category.<br>  <br>  And there is a character limit, so it may not post all at 1 time if it's long.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDED  It's when you ask the users here to WRITE the essay for you that it's soliciting.  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/abuse/guidelines-19.html;_ylt=Ai5PQHRtnR8e9FTAWLpgSqtujSN4">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>|`|suPD7c3gaa	No, that would be considered soliciting.

If you wanted an opinion then yahoo answers is good but if u need help with homework then it promotes laziness|`|TdrgZwnoaa	By their steadfast refusal to stop the TROLLS and the VIGILANTES,  YAHOO is promoting ignorance. YAHOO claims that this is a member regulated site but they do not give us the proper tools to keep these people from repeatedly attacking other members. And even if we did have the tools there are those that would abuse that privilege too. Simply put; there is no effective defense against a truly dedicated arssehole. And until YAHOO institutes a human moderator we will just have to bear with it.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	it helps alot of people i think there maybe too many youngsters on this but oh well that is fine you can tell but the youngesters may not which could be a problem but i for one think its ok.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	Over all I think it reduces ignorance (lack of knowledge) in people that are truly trying to learn something. For those who choose to remain ignorant, despite the good advice they get? Well ... there's not much you can do about them.|`|UQ4XXu5Yaa	I feel that it allows people to freely promote their ideas, which are often misleading to others, creating even more of a trolling problem.|`|xkeSwj3Naa	Promotes.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	All I know is that Im much more aware of the amount of ignorant people.
IxuMTGd4aa	Nope!<br>  <br>  I once saw someone with over SIX THOUSAND BEST ANSWERS in Polls & Surveys, and that person wasn't a Top Contributor. It is impossible, unless Yahoo! Answers decided to change their rules, which, won't happen in a long time.<br>  <br>  And, you can't become a TC (Top Contributor) in Jokes & Riddles, either. I saw someone with two hundred Best Answers in Jokes & Riddles, but he wasn't awarded with a badge, either.<br>  <br>  Its because it is all entirely opinion. None of the answers are facts, just opinions, what you think, not a fact that you can prove that could truly help someone. I don't even really waste my time their if I won't get rewarded.<br>  <br>  I think the easiest category to get BA in is Yahoo! Answers... because really... there are a million people there (including me) with badges for Yahoo! Answers...|`|rytSFBbgaa	Nope its not|`|suPD7c3gaa	No it's not.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	I was going to answer no, but see that others that know even more than I did already.<br>  <br>  So, no, you can't.<br>  <br>  That said, interesting answers though. Thanks.<br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Unfortunately not. Polls & Surveys, along with Jokes & Riddles, are the only categories you are unable to receive a top contributor badge in. The reason is because they require no specific knowledge to answer the questions posted there. Every other section has a top contributor badge available.

YSbCVt3Uaa	Cc stands for carbon copy. Which means that you can send the email to other people other than the person its addressed to. Just as an FYI. You would put them on Cc: However, they do not need to reply because it mainly for the To: person. However, you want those Cc'ed to know that you sent the message to the To: person and you want them to know what was said. At work I often put my boss on Cc: so she can see what I am working on or what issues I am facing with either other employees or customers.|`|p3eyCMfsaa	when you need to include a copy  of the e-mail to another person you write the other person e-mail address in the cc space
MYhQqeV7aa	Contact your state's Attorney General for information and complaint forms. I don't know whether you will get your money back. If your payment last week was by credit card, you have a chance of getting that back. Contact the credit card company.<br>  Are you also interning at a radio or TV station? They might give you help.|`|506hHQr7aa	Your question in a little confusing. You said you enrolled, but did you actually take the course? Did you complete it and receive a certificate? If so, you probably don't have any recourse. They do promise lifetime placement and use of the facilities, but not your lifetime... the lifetime of the company. Just because the school failed does not mean you have no career in broadcasting. That ball is in your court!<br>  <br>  But as Mary suggested, you should contact your state's Attorney General's office to find out what rights you have.

Answering is 2 points, voting is 1 point, logging in each day is 1 point. If you choose someone as best answer to a question you asked, you get 3 points back. If your answer gets chosen as best answer it's 10 points, plus 1 point for each thumbs up, up to 50. Thumbs down mean nothing. A violation is -10 points.

Do if you have an E-76 Error with 1 red ring segment it means you have a GPU error and only a one year warranty.  If you haven't purchased and extended warranty then I'm afraid you have no choice but to fix it yourself or send it in.<br>  <br>  I know you must be frustrated with the whole deal.  I know I am. For the amount of money that you pay for that game system it should be more robust.

2eztcCO0aa	I agree.  Why not like two boys?  That's the fun of dating and being young; you can like more than one boy and even date more than one boy if you like.<br>  <br>  Later on, you'll start having to choose, date just one boy (or man) at a time and even make a commitment to a relationship.

ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Yahoo's entire original question and answer board system was shut down due to legal action. Some thin-skinned wimpy lawyer out in Los Angeles got his knickers in a twist because some other posters were flaming him, so he got a judge to accept a class action suit against Yahoo for allowing all the bullies to call the simps names....<br>  <br>  I am not kidding. Used to be you could go to virtually every news story on Yahoo, and there was a "discuss" option that let anyone and everyone talk about the article... or whatever else they wanted. Yahoo lost it all because their lawyers caved in to that jackass.|`|W9IQYcjNaa	I had an internet stalker bully whore that followed me onto multiply.com, and all over here on yahoo. She created clones of me and answered most salaciously and said stuff against MY BABIES(because they're biracial) and my fiance(who is-duh-African American). She left harassing messages on youtube...Made slide-type movies of me and a whole bunch of other yahoo users. She even posted some info(false of course) and stolen and doctored pictures of me on some ameteur porn site. I wasn't the first person she harassed. Sure I wasn't the last. HOWEVER, Dammit I snitched. I got in contact with the FBI/Secret Service via the internet to report her bullying @$$. It was one thing when she was messing with me-but MY KIDS? OH HELLLL no.SO FAR, I haven't heard back from her/it, so maybe something was actually DONE. I never went to court, but every time I was harassed, I went back to my report, and updated it.|`|oKsKKxeaaa	When the site was new, I came across a users answer that was horrific ...admitting to a serious crime with details...I won't go into the crime because it was horrible, but I reported it, as did many others, and this person was traced through the internet...I have seen some kooks since then, but none as bad as that one...|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	there have been "legal" questions asked, and many of the answers have been provided by experts, some of whom were actually attorneys.

7u77AiBjaa	I don't think you're banned. Try clearing your browser's cookies and cache. Then, re-start your computer.<br>  <br>  Your experiment seems fruitless though. Yes, if you access a 360 space from a different account then that would count as a page view. Each time the page re-freshes, that is a hit on that page. It's not a "unique hit" though, which is a tracking stat that Y!360 doesn't count.
673739cc8cf9ce9f1a5e007efbd067bcaa	Copy and paste, sometimes you have to go ahead and submit the answer without the link. Then you have to edit the answer you then put the link in and resubmit the answer. For some reason yahoo will not  always let you enter the link. Hope this helps!!!
IGAx1FgEaa	make sure u don't have mail classic... if u do have the old one, u should be able to click on mail upgrade or plus or something like that.....
7u77AiBjaa	Besides up to 4 photos in the Personal Photos module, which tends to work incorrectly...<br>  <br>  <br>  BLOG:<br>  1) Click "My Blog" at the top of your 360 space. Click "Compose Blog Entry" at the top of the page (if you've adjusted your settings once already). Above your entry space, click the "Browse" button for the photo upload tool. Search for the image that's saved to your hard drive. It must be a JPEG formatted image (extension ending with .jpg, .jpeg, and .jpe) and under 5 MB in file size.<br>  * The picture will appear above your entry and doing it this way, you can only use one picture.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The following methods require that your image is hosted via an online hosting service like Flickr (<a href="http://flickr.com" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com</a> ) and Photobucket (<a href="http://photobucket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/</a> ):<br>  <br>  2) Check out the 360 team post on dragging & dropping photos into blogs: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Ehaak.hdNZkEAzDrpa4Q--?cq=1&p=4294">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha...</a> .<br>  * This method allows many photos to be used in an entry, with your choice in placement. Make sure that you are using an image that's on it's own page (not on a page that is shared with others). So click on the image and get to that image's full detail page (likely the largest view of the picture, not the thumbnail).<br>  <br>  3) Copy and paste an absolute URL for the image (which looks <a href="http://www.domainname.com/nameoffile.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.domainname.com/nameoffile.gif</a> or .jpg....something similar to that) into a blog entry.<br>  - Check the box next "View HTML source" box (on the upper right of your entry's space).<br>  - Type in the HTML code:<br>  <img src="URL of image" height="# of pixels" width="# of pixels"><br>  NOTE: With Flickr, just use the block of code above the pic's URL that they tell you to use...wouldn't want to violate their guidelines.<br>  - Uncheck the "View HTML source" box to get back to the regular blog screen.<br>  WARNING: Do not save your entry with out adding some text.<br>  - Click "Save"<br>  * This method allows you to use any formatted image as long as it's hosted on an online server and not only your hard drive. Check each service for their list of accepted file types before choosing one.<br>  <br>  4) Due to a recent glitch with embedding flash objects, embedding photo slideshows is more difficult. You can try the workaround described here: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=858">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> .<br>  <br>  <br>  BACKGROUND:<br>  After logging into 360, click on the "My Page" link next to your "Home" link. Then, at the top under that line of links is the word "Theme: [name of whatever theme you currently have]." Click the "Change Theme" link that's directly under those words.<br>  <br>  On the new page that comes up, there's a paragraph stating "Select a Theme - Change the look of your Yahoo! 360° page by picking a theme.

dcWN4v6Jaa	The point of getting higher levels is that you get more privileges. When you get to level 2 you can rate (thumbs up and down). Here are a couple of websites to help. You can delete your answer by clicking the delete button in the small print to delete it. In order to comment you have to go to a resolved question. Then find the comment button. Click that. Type in your comment. Then click submit. There aren't any rewards when you become a top contributor or go to the highest level which is 7. You can send a user a message if the person allows it. You can check by clicking on their avatar. To make a avatar you go to your profile and click on "Edit My Info". Then scroll down until you see the options for the avatars. Click on "Edit My Avatar" or something like that in the blue print. Then a page should come up. Then you make the avatar.

Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.<br>  <br>  Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.<br>  <br>  Hints: <br>  <br>  answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)<br>  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)<br>  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)<br>  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)<br>  you also get a point a day for signing in<br>  <br>  each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|SZvJVM2yaa	247 your at levle 1 now <br>  levle 1 is from        1 to    249  <br>  levle 2 is from    250 to     999<br>  levle 3 is from  1000 to   2499<br>  levle 4 is from  2500 to   4999<br>  levle 5 is from  5000 to   9999<br>  levle 6 is from 10000 to 24000<br>  levle 7 is from 25000+<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Au50F3W62qZxFh.TAGNtgFPsy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|d645e3c1f0da82127be8455d37dddb8faa	next  to your avatar is blue writing, each one is a link <br>  your name = link to your profile <br>  your score = link to the scoring page <br>  your level = link to the levels page|`|RnwrEcY5aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AheTYdkeVEyV0CCqJhgvfL759xd.;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|89ff8fa4f5283b5a62c3ea573df41106aa	You need 1000 points
zDQIPFH2aa	You may be seeing the result of the prefilter.  When you ask such questions, check to see they show up in the category list.  If not, then the Yahoo prefilter caught them.  Such questions are reviewed by the YA staff and that can take several days.  By the time they are posted, they are on page 4 or more of the category list and no one sees them.<br>  <br>  A couple of things to try.  Post a very short version of just the question (no added details) with no sexual terms, get it posted, then add the rest of the question in the added details.  That may free it.<br>  <br>  The other thing to consider is this.  Your question may not be explicit, but users may see that to answer, they have to be explicit and that they risk a violation answering the question, so they don't answer it.
OA8bMuNOaa	OK when at least 2 or more people answer your question it will have the BEST ANSWER on top of the person's picture. When you click on it, it will take you to a different page (not a different site,) it will say ' rate this answer' and it will say 'comment on this answer' Hope this Helps!!!|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.<br>  <br>  To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Starting four hours after you post the question, up until the time expires, a box will appear next to each answer where you can pick the best answer. Before the four hours, you can't do anything, after the time has expired, you become just another voter on the question.
