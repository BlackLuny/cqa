I'm just wondering how hard is it to get the basics of Japanese sentence arrangements and usage of politeness levels to be able to communicate with a native speaker      Thanks
20090205114806AAvlWxh	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Lebanon	What are you thoughts on this (Lebanon Category)?	SATAN, n. Being instated as an archangel, Satan made himself multifariously objectionable and was finally expelled from Heaven. Halfway in his descent he paused, bent his head in thought a moment and at last went back. "There is one favor that I should like to ask," said he.   "Name it."   "Man, I understand, is about to be created. He will need laws."   "What, wretch! you his appointed adversary, charged from the dawn of eternity with hatred of his soul -- you ask for the right to make his laws?"   "Pardon; what I have to ask is that he be permitted to make them himself."   It was so ordered.       Ambrose Pierce      It certainly made me think!

I know that the 747 is wider than any other twin engine aircraft (which are so in vogue today). That is definitely NOT an advantage for the passenger, no matter how you look at it.    Maybe there are some other advantages that I have not thought of? Are the seats typically more spacious? The aisles wider? Bigger bathrooms? Quieter or smoother ride?    Or is the current trend to use smaller twin-engine aircraft bad for the consumer in almost every way?

20090205125827AA1DvoH	Travel;Italy;Venice	How does the building sink in Venice at the end of Casino Royale?	I assume that the buildings in Venice are actually built on earth and not actually floating on water, so how the heck does that building manage to sink when the inflatables are shot?   And not just sink a little bit, it sinks all the way; an fast, as if the canal is about a mile deep!   Is there some magical way to build multi story buildings which float on unfeasibly deep canals with the aid of a few balloons to hold it up? Am I stupid? Does anyone care?

20090205101539AAU6mwf	Travel;Germany;Other - Germany	What mistakes are there in this german text?	Ich besuche eine Gymnasium nur für M?dchen. Es hei?t “AGGS’’und sie befindet sich in der Stadtmitte nicht weit von den Geschaften; das gef?llt mir, weil die Stadt echt sch?n ist. Auch finde ich das ist sehr praktisch, weil ich in der Stadtmitte wohnen. Es gibt 1500 Schülerinnen und 80 Lehrerinnen; das hat mir nicht so gut gefallen, weil das ein bisschen zu gro? für mich ist. Aber AGGS ist ziemlich altmodisch und sie würde in 1901 gegründet. Ich glaube, dass sie wirklich alt ist und das gef?llt mir, weil sie historische ist. Meine Schule beginnt um sieben Uhr und endet um halb vier Uhr. Ich finde, dass es nicht so schlecht ist, weil ich gern zur Schule gehe, aber meine ideale Schule würde um 10 Uhr beginnen und um 2 Uhr enden. Es h?tte weniger Hausaufgaben, weil ich zu wenig zeit für Hobbys habe. Jedoch verstehe ich mich gut mit den Lehrern und meinen Klassenkameraden, denn sie so freundlich und lieb sind. Ich finde   es auch gut, dass es viele gute AGs nach dem Unterricht gibt; man kann alles machen: Musik, Theater, Kunst, Sport und viel mehr!      Früher gab es eine furchtbar Turnhalle. Das hat mir gar nicht gefallen, denn es zu klein und alt war. Auch gab es ein gro?es aber schmutziges Schwimmbad. Jetzt gibt es eine neue, moderne Turnhalle und ein sauberes Schwimmbad und das gef?llt mir, weil es besser als vorher ist. Auch ist es toll für die Sport AGs!      Ich lerne Naturwissenschaften, Mathe, Deutsch, Kunst und Geschichte. Ich finde, dass es ziemlich toll ist, weil Englisch und Kunst mein Lieblingsf?cher sind, obwohl ich Naturwissenschaften schrecklich finde. N?chstes Jahr werde ich die Mittlere Reife machen und ich freue mich darauf, weil ich auf die Uni gehen m?chte.      Meine Schuluniform gef?llt mir, weil sie bequem und nicht zu h?sslich ist. Sie ist ein blauer Pullover, ein wei?es Hemd und ein blauer Rock mit Schwarzen Schuhen. Das finde ich ausgezeichneit!Die Schule spezialisert in Sport; es gibt eine moderne Turnhalle und ein gro?es Schwimmbad und es hat auch viel Sport-AGs. Ich finde es gut, dass AGGS so sportlich ist. Das ist gesund für sich und man soll immer aktiv sein.Die Schülerinnen und seinen Eltern sollen diese Schule w?hlen, weil sie ein ausgezeichnetes system hat. Es gibt etwas für jede! AGGS ist perfekt für die Zukunft, weil man viel lernen kann.

I was browsing through our local newspaper in Ismailia, "AL Kanah", and I saw pictures of President Mubarak, CBUH, our governor, and the chairman of the university. I noticed that none of them was looking at the camera. They were all looking away, either right or left.    Did they not know that they were being photographed? I find that very rude. The guy I go to have my photograph taken always yells at me whenever I look away. I don't know why they don't get yelled at.   It is very annoying to look at those people while they're looking away.
20090205104607AA8cniT	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	I would like to visit Ireland;Any suggestions of best how to do this.?	Hello all,   I am a 42 year old female and would like to achieve my dream trip of going to Ireland. However, when I start deciding to do so and look at all the travel brochures I come back even more confused then decided about going. I would like to travel solo but have some of my trip guided and some of it not burdened by group schedules, getting on and off a bus, the forced conversations because you are part of a group of strangers. Basically I would like to have the opportunity to really experience the people and towns without the hassles of someone elses schedules and dictation. Does anyone have any suggestions or is there someone out there that is also wanting to do this type of traveling to Ireland. Any help is suggested.   Thanks,

20090205110359AAhC2nE	Travel;United States;Las Vegas	Would this be a safe walk in Vegas at night?	I am deciding on where to stay when I go to vegas this year and I have a choice between the Hilton Grand Vacations on the Strip or the Summer Bay Resorts one block off the strip near the Flamingo.  The Hilton is near the Sahara and although appears like a nicer place, it isn't really near any of the other casinos.  The Summer Bay Resorts are much closer, but I would have to walk from them to the back of one of the casinos near there.      I play poker when in Vegas and the issue is I do not usually stop playing until around 3am - 7am and I would have to walk back to the Summer Bay Resort alone and with $500 - $2K cash in my pocket.  I am a tad concerned about this since its off the strip and I would be cutting down a side street.  I am a big guy and I will be sober plus I do not dress flashy, but it seems like an easy target for someone at that time of the night off the strip.      So should I be concerned about this walk?  I will be walking this every night/morning.

When we get to America, we'll be using a shuttle bus to get to the hotel. I assume this is like public transport, so will we be required to tip the driver, and if so, how much?      6.

20090205133837AAZnzsp	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	Wikipedia says mizuage was the practice of selling a maiko's virginity until the 1950s. Is this true?	I first got interested in the history of geisha when I read Memoirs of a Geisha.  I have since heard that his portrayal of mizuage was entirely untruthful, and that geisha never participated in this practice.  But I recently researched geisha on Wikipedia, and it says that this tradition of mizuage was practiced up until the 1950s.  In that case, the author's portrayal of it in Memoirs of a Geisha, which takes place in the 1930s, would be accurate (despite the fact that it is a work of fiction).      Does anyone know if this is true?

There is a "Round Barn" (or used to be) on the left side of the road as you are going up the hill to this neighborhood.  At bottom of hill there used to be a resaurant called Equus (I think) now there is a double tree hotel.   Looking for the neighborhood to see what type of real estate is available up there.   Thanks!

20090205141643AA8uZKe	Travel;United Kingdom;London	Just wondering if it will be still snow in London/Manchester around Feb 20?	Unfortnately I have a trip coming up (feb 19-feb 23) which was planned around month back and who would have expected severe snow as it did in last few days or so. My trip plans cannot be changed as I am coming to UK to watch particular fixture at Old Trafford. If its cold, its fine but I am more worried about snow pouring down and disrupting all type of transport services. My itinerary is 2 days stay in London and then travelling to Manchester for one day on match day. Just keeping my fingers crossed now. I live in Baltimore, US.      Thanks   Abhijit
20090205141542AApWyUu	Travel;Other - Destinations	Have you been offered a free holiday? Want to hear our experience?	We were offered a free holiday but couldn't identify the catch early enough to stop us wasting our time. And I want to share the horrible experience with you so maybe you won't waste your time.      1) There was a silly short telephone survey, they said they were East Devon Marketing.   2) A few weeks later they called back to say that for answering the survey we had won a free holiday. I said no thanks, that if it sounds too good to be true then it is too good to be true. However they insisted that it was not time share, it was a genuine offer, that the company believe it better to spend their marketing budget on cheap holidays (to buy market share) and word of mouth than TV adverts. All we had to do was give them 2.5 hours of our time, no obligation to buy anything and we'd get the free holiday. They said it was going to be with The Holiday Group but then I didn’t hear that name again. They said they'd give us shopping vouchers to cover the travel cost. We could take 2 years to decide where to go so long as we gave 10 weeks booking notice.   3) East Devon Marketing called us again and said it wasn't free but ￡49 each to cover admin, seems a bit more reasonable than free eh? I was concerned that we'd have to make 50 phone calls or something and they promised there was none of that either. Why not sit through the presentation and get the free holiday?   4) We went along and the whole thing WAS set up to sell us time share - we were lied to. The sales people were pretty unpleasant to us, however I consoled myself that we half expected this and would get a free-ish holiday for listening to him. We found that the name of the company turned out to be Interval World. Their web site is open about that being a time share, hence they didn't give that name earlier. So we stuck it out for the free holiday. They used hard sell techniques and tried subtle things to make us feel bad about not buying into their time share but fortunately we were firm about it. It would have cost maybe ￡15k plus about ￡500 per year.   5) We said no. We were given our travel vouchers and leaflet to claim the cheap holiday. I asked how much the travel vouchers were for and they said about ￡40 for how far we had come - it turned out to be ￡10 on the card we were given SO THEY LIED TO US TWICE ABOUT THIS.   The leaflet about the holiday was from The Sugar Reef Travel club and it was stamped by St Frances Marketing. At this point we found out that you had to be in gainful employment and:   a) unless we bought our own flights we had no choice about where we could go, they would specify the destination   b) we had to be ready to fly from ANY UK airport!!!   c) we had to specify 4 different weeks when we could go over the next 2 years (there were further restrictions on this). THEY WOULD TELL US UP TO 15 DAYS BEFORE THE ACTUAL DATE THAT WE HAD THE HOLIDAY COMING UP – COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL.   d) actually we had to apply within 14 days for any of the overseas holidays   e) we had to pay the airport taxes, not mentioned until then   f) only one of our choices of weeks could be in peak time – but we are limited by school holidays   g) we would have to agree to sit through another presentation once at the holiday (so actually in the initial phone marketing they should have said you have to sit through TWO presentations)      I believe they rely on it being too impractical for people to take the cheap holiday that they offer and so they can offer it at the start. THE RIGHT QUESTION AT THE START WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ASK FOR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE HOLIDAY UP FRONT, OR WE WON'T GO. If they are hiding something then they won't share that. I felt that I had been misled many times already, that the conditions were too difficult to practically work and I didn't trust any of the people in the process so the leaflet for the "free" holiday went in the recycling.      If you want a time share then maybe it's good for you, but surely it's better to take the time to buy one after having time to consider it carefully; and would you trust a set up where they mislead you about so many things?      If Interval World get to see this then: guys I'm sorry to blow your cover but I'm being honest about my experience.

20090205143150AADaoQt	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	What is the difference between...?	Arabs who don't want the state of Israel to exist and Israel supporters and/or Zionists who don't want the state of Palestine to exist, where some have even gone on to say that "there is no such thing as Palestine and there are no Palestinians."      I've noticed many times about some Israeli's bringing up the fact about how there are some Arabs who don't want Israel to exist (which is true, I'm not denying this fact!)   HOWEVER, some of those same people will say that there is no such thing and there never has been a state of Palestine, nor are there any Palestinians. Why is it wrong for Arabs to feel that way, but not wrong for Israel supporters to say that there are no Palestinians and that they don't even exist?      Isn't that hypocritical for someone to criticize the Arabs for feeling that way but yet they feel the same way about them?      I'm not trying to defend the actions or beliefs of the Arabs, I just want your opinions, so please don't waste your time if you're going to rant at me. I just want your opinion, so please answer me in a CIVILIZED MANNER!! If you really want me to see your side of the story, it would be best if you didn't try to insult me.

I have done a little bit of research, and I am getting a little annoyed with the availability of information I need.  I have already talked to the Philippine embassy here, but I wasn't given clear instructions.  And the instructions I did get made me feel like they were trying to just get me off the phone.      My question is: What do I need to do as far as legal papers, visas, and passports to have a smooth trip there without having to worry about not being able to return to the Philippines later?  I have my passport already, but I feel it is not that easy.      Thanks in advance for all the tips and advice guys.
