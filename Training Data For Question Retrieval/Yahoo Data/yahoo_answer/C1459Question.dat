Okay, I acknowledge she's a nutjob on so many levels....let's ignore that for a second.    Is any Pagan clergy OBLIGED to marry you to your spouse of choice?     Does any Pagan really think that their local clergyperson, by virtue of going through hoops with the state, etc., is required to spend their time and effort on someone they've never met, who certainly is not a member of their working group, let alone their trad?    This is the second time, BTW, I'm pretty sure this is the same girl who demanded I marry her and her boyfriend before November Eve and took offense that I said she'd need at least 1 year of my meeting with the couple before I'd help.

Okay, several years ago, I was friends with this one girl was a very touchy feely person.        So one night, I was hanging out with a group of people and she was there.  She was touching my arm and holding my wrist and stuff...  Well, I had been drinking and I guess I just didn't like her touching me so much.  And I told her to stop touching me, in front of others.  And I don't think it was the right way for me to handle it.  It just wasn't nice...      Well, ever since then I've felt kind of guilty about it.  I apologized to her once back at that time but I could tell that she didn't really forgive/forget.      So it's still sticking with me.  And I know she talked about me to her girlfriends, so it put a dent on my reputation.      How would you handle this?

Want a Real Woman!'s Blogs    02/04/09 09:33 PM    These are my confessions       (THIS IS KIND OF A REMIX I WROTE TO THE SONG "Confessions by: usher" BUT ITS REALLY LIKE A POEM)          Just when I thought I found the one the chick that would be by my side said she had one on the way, These are my confessions man i'm gone and I don't know what to do I guess I gotta keep on til the find the one. You said you would be my chick and be down to ride said you would never leave and always be by my side. Baby why did you lie? Damn I can't stop crying . I can't understand I gave you my all , you said and you swore up and down that you wouldn't and always be around. Friends ? Hell naw. What do you expect? I'm just your reject. I can't take this pain its driving me insane all the **** you told me I thought you were better than these lames. I cared about you, I thought about you, damn I put you first thought you would be the last one who would make me hurt.       I said age aint nothing but a number and now I really understand I wanted to be nothing but your woman. I'm standing here stuck don't know what to say, told me you cared said you would be my baby. I wouldve taken you out of harms way. Patience is the key ...you can't always have it your way. Right, now and today I'm asking why , why? Why did you have me believe ? That there would be a you and me? Ooh baby I just want the truth its been weeks but damn I still miss you. These are my confessions and I swore I would never lie. If you came back no doubt I would just be confused i'm not no toy and I wont be used. I'm tired of being hurt this I don't deserve. Girl I trusted you in each and every word. We laid on the couch , I laid my head on your body we discussed that we will always be. Together Whitney and Stephanie. But damn that was just a lie? You wanted some attention, I tried to give it all but I can't be there 24/7 like you expecting. No i'm not mad more like sad. Gutta is what I called you ...I never named anyone else. You were gutta cause I thought you were real...but what the hell .. baby whats the deal? Was it because of my emotions ...was it because of my expressions baby i'm telling you this cause these are my confessions.       But Gods going to bless me trust me I know he will thankfully I know that God will never fail. Things happen for a reason and i'm so happy that you do. Even the things that happened between me and you. Sometimes I feel like fool I jumped in your life and for you to leave me damn that just aint right. I wanted to be apart of your daughter's life even your lil dog's. I'm telling you baby if you were smart enough to stay you wouldve had it all. The happiness, the joy, even a baby boy. There is nothing i wouldn't have done , i know you've been through it all but I realized you do it to yourself. When you find happiness you never let go and talk to someone else. And thats one thing I cannot believe you done. You said I was the one but you were saying you were meeting both male and females one by one. I can't believe my eyes , or what you have to say...just know now God is making it easier for me to find and trust and believe. Everyone just always move slow especially with love cause the one you love could be the one who you hurt.       I sometimes want to pick up the phone and tell you exactly how I feel but I aint got time for the drama and baby thats for real. I couldve been so rude and told you ..your a damn fool. But damn its your loss and someone else's gain anyway. I'ma end this on a good note even though i'm hurt but I don't want to say anything negative cause karma is a motha . Everyone appreciate everything you got cause you never know a good thing until its gone for now ...i'm moving on.

Ok so I work at this resturant for a while and me and my manager kissed one night when we all went out. He was begging me for kisses telling me that im cute,,, Afterwards he asked me not to say anything, then asked me to come over his place to hang out with a bunch of people from work I never went. Anyways, then he acted like nothing ever happened sort of for 7 months he was sort of acting profesional but still being flirty. We didnt get into hour conversations but there was definately some friendly communication especially the last nite I saw him. Anyways he got transffered to another country to work at another place i guess quicker then he expected. I missed him by a half an hour and didnt get to say goodbye. So two days later i saw him on facebook and requested him? Did I cross the line? Should I have not requested him? He has a girlfriend sort of also. P.S  1of my fellow employees requested him and he accepted. should i have not done it?

20061006215629AAAYoKO	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Distance Relationships and Sex drive?	I'm 20 years old and in the past sex drive and erection strength have never been a problem.  I could gain a lasting erection through just thinking about sex and would masturbate fairly regularly.  I recently entered into a long distance relationship and when we were together, everything was fine sexually.  Since we've been apart though (about 2 months) I started to notice a decrease in the number of sexual thoughts I have.  I can still gain an erection from just thinking about it but its never as strong and never lasts anymore.  I'm just wondering if this is a sign of not being with my partner for so long or if I should take action before I see her to ensure my ability to perform.  I'm really worried about not being able to be there for her and its affecting my confidence in other areas of life too....  just wondering what people think the deal is or if theres anything i should do...

So I've been kind of seeing this girl that I met at a BDSM party about a month ago.        I went to see her last weekend, and since she lives about an hour from me, I spent the night at her place.  At about 5 o'clock in the morning, her ex boyfriend shows up drunk.  She lets him sleep on her couch (I'm in her bed), but then she comes in and says that she couldn't let him drive home (which I understand) but then tells me that she still loves him, but is tired of his drama and doesn't know what to do.       I got to feeling really uncomfortable with the awkwardness of the situation and everything, so I left.  She's called me 3 times now and I haven't returned her calls.        Am I being mean?  I just felt a little offended that she tells me "I still love him" with me there, and invites him in to spend the night with me already there.

20090204222414AAm1S93	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Would this help the food servers who complain in here?	First off, my goal is NOT to decrease the cost of my meal, including tip. I am satisfied with the total paid. But rather to help out the food servers that we hear from daily complaining about the bad tippers, or those who don't tip at all, or tip 15% instead of 20% or whatever the complaint du jour is.      THIS IS THE SUGGESTION:   How about the restaurant giving the server the same basic salary as now, but give them a commission on what they sell!   ______________________________________...      The restaurant owner must already compute the sales per server for income tax purposes, and must pay the server their tips from those credit card slips when it was added to that instead of cash. So, the bookwork needed is already in place.      The advantages:   1) the customer would not need to decide how much to give the server, that would be decided by negotiation with the restaurant owner, just like the rest of our salaries are.      2) no one would short tip or stiff our loyal and kind hearted servers again.      3) servers would be obligated to pay taxes on ALL the money they receive!      4) as in all other service jobs, if the server was not pleasant or helpful or prompt, we would complain to the manager, stop going to the restaurant, or simply ask for another server. Very simple.      5) We would not have to listen to servers whining about tips anymore in Yahoo! Answers.      Again, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with paying less for a meal. MOST COUNTRIES DO NOT TIP, or at least do not tip as a "required custom" which considered a server's pay. They are paid a wage, a tip is either very small as a consideration, or as a reward for EXTRA service.      What are the flaws with this idea to help our servers?         Please, anyone saying other countries tip and pay as we do in the USA, either don't lie, or back up your statement with some links to prove what you say. It simply isn't the system in most places in the entire world (outside of International Hotel Chains, and that tip in SE Asia is 7.8%, and may be skipped if the customer wishes)
20090204222614AAlz0Ab	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I finally realized why, specifically, I'm not a church goer. Why?	Because surely God must have a sense of humor and their is little or none in the Bible. One need only live to see that this is universal truth. In fact, sadly, virtually anything really funny may not be permitted in a church, it would be like a fart in church. Laughter is ultimately life's finest expression and least celebrated of human qualities owing, I believe, largely to religious stiffness.

I HAVE HAD IT WITH THIS MOTH ERF#$INGA SNAKES ON THIS MOTHER$UC!#G PLANE!!!"

Do they have difficulties dealing with the reality and truth of life?  If these people are mentally sick at the time, why are they?  Do they have a legitimate reason to be depressed, do others have a legitimate reason not to be depressed?  Could it be that it is the non-depressed people who are under a delusion?      If everyone is happy and content, then who among them will tell them or even be aware that there is no reason to be happy and content.      Spiritually speaking, of course,

20090204222513AArEU8X	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have you seen God or Satan temple lately?	Probably the whole world would say no, but those who are wise would know all they have to do is look in the mirror.  You think you are yourself or your own man, well your not.  Either your with God or Satan, either God has control of you or Satan does.  And whoever it is, it's the one who claims your soul (body).  So next time you stand in front of the mirror "Realize" who you really belong to.  And if Satan has a hold on you really tight, then your chances are very slim for understanding what you are, who you are, and your meaning in life.      peace.

20090204223035AAWpjUe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Even if a God did give us Free Will, what is the reason for making a Hell?	Religious people claim that if you are bad and go against what God wants, then you are supposed to go to Hell. But if God gave us the ability to be evil, why is there a need for a supreme being to create a special place for bad people to go, with a special supreme evil being (Satan) to watch over them? Why wouldn't God just make a time out corner in heaven for bad people?      When you get in trouble in school, they don't take you out of the class and throw you into a pit of acid with all of the other kids who misbehaved. They just either send you somewhere else in the school temporarily, or in worse cases suspend you for a while. Either way, you are still in the same physical state as the other humans, and at some point you will be back to class with the others. No big deal.      And to think that this simple concept of punishment was created by humans!  Why couldn't an all knowing God think of something that basic that didn't require a special existence known as Hell that was ruled by a God-like entity called Satan? Why the overly exaggerated drastic measures?

20090204223927AANZ1TP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, would you give me your 2 cents?	Christians, Is it your job to send money to the poor and starving people of 3rd world countries?      The biggest argument I think I'm going to hear would be something like, "Jesus says rich give to poor." And while that's fair enough, I'd like to give you a different way of thinking on this.      The god portrayed in modern Christianity could not be more great. A creator of the universe and perfect in every way would be the only to have absolute control every piece of life on earth.      This god lets people starve and we can argue day and night about why, in any case the people starve and die daily, and more and more commercials come on your western world televisions arousing your sympathies.       So by giving these starving folks your money, you're saying "God is letting these people starve(because God controls all), but I will not allow it. I will be the one to let them live another day."       Is this action taking human life and death out of your god's hands?

20090204220219AAnj7on	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	You say you have proof of god's existence? Ok. What is it?	Please be aware I am NOT disputing faith in this question. I am  directing this question to those few who seriously say they have PROOF of the existence of a god. So, if you have proof, let's hear it.      BUT, before you reveal it, if I may, I'd like to set 3 "rules."      1) Argument from incredulity is fallacious. For example, saying "Look at the world around you. It's too "perfect." It had to be created, therefore, there's obviously a God." This is a logical fallacy. Just because you cannot fathom any other explanation does not mean there isn't one. All you are really saying is "I don't know and I am inserting "god." There are MANY other possible explanations. Some more plausible than others. So please refrain from using this as "proof." I will not accept it.       2) These also are not valid and will not be accepted as "proof."    -You can't prove there's not a god!      This is just a silly argument. You cannot disprove invisible horses who eat cereal either.      And finally:       3) For people who believe in the "one true god....." whatever proof you do have, ask yourself, could that same proof not be stated by someone else who believes in a different god? If so, how can it be valid for you and not them? Which means......by your logic, their god must exist as well. For example, if you say "God speaks to me" and this is your proof, fine. However, if someone who believes in one of the 3799 other propsed gods says that as well, would that not be proof that their god also exists? So it's either proof for both gods or not proof at all. There's no logical way it can be proof for one god but not the other.       So, to sum up, does anyone have any REAL proof for god? If so, if you believe in one god, is it truly just proof for your god only? Or must it work for everyone else as well?      P.S Please keep in mind this is for people who say they actually have proof, not for those who say it's based on faith. I am not arguing that. And lastly, there is no need to insult me, please keep it civil as I have.

20090204194652AADurJW	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Should I confront a coworker about a trivial matter?	I have been employed by an organization for about 6 months now - not a long time. Recently, they are hiring some new people and thus some people in our team, including me, were required to move to other cubicles. Our manager has randomly assigned us to different cubicles and I happened to get a good one - closer to the back, less noisy and passers-by. A few hours after the meeting where we were shown the temporary floor plan prepared by the manager, one coworker obviously didn't like the cubicle he was given (closer to the microwave) and asked the boss to move me to his cubicle so that he could have mine without talking to me. To my surprise, the boss not only agreed, but also gave him the entire floor plan so that he could make additional changes so that his close buddies are sitting all around him in better cubicles, and then he e-mailed the floor plan to all of us titled "Finalized floor plan". I obviously don't like the fact that he forced me to accept a bad cubicle and give up a good one for him - he's just been working there a few more months than I but obviously has a much better relationship with the boss. My question to you is, should I confront this coworker and request having my originally assigned cubicle back or should I just get it over with to make peace with him and keep my career safe?      He obviously pretended that nobody had any problems with his own decision to move people around and say hi and smile to everybody (he's a nice and polite person I must say, it's just this selfish and disrespectful act of his driving me crazy). For those of you who think I should keep it to myself and not to rock the boat to keep my job safe (in light of the tough economic times).

Oh who knows 3 years? and I want to get her something out of the ordinary, original to put it at that. She doesn't know me all that well, but we were classmates. I cannot and I repeat, cannot ever talk to her! So I came up with this idea.      I'm an artist, I specialize in fine arts, painting, charcoal work, and the such. I'm thinking of leaving the whole chocolates and cards this valentines and making her something special.       I'm thinking of drawing a picture of a rose, realistically, possibly still life or from a photograph. And I'll frame it, and for a touch of the valentines symbolism I'll add leaves of roses up inside the corner of the frame. Which will overall, as I picture it should be a very delicate and romantic gift.       So, what do you guys think? Feel free to give me any other advice or tips and making this better. Thanks in advance!

20090204220714AAd6rlv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Yet another coming out question - how/when did you know?	Yep, my sexuality is something I've been wondering about for a few months now. I've already described myself as "bi-curious" or "beginning to think of myself as bisexual" to a few people I know REALLY well but yeah I'm nowhere near telling my parents or anyone else... I'm just not yet sure about all this - and I know, it takes time, so I hear, but what I'd like to hear really are other peoples' stories of how they discovered their true sexual orientation.     As for my background, well I'm still pretty young so haven't had the chance to try very much yet, but I've had relationships with men for a few years now, just started having m/f sex and it's okay but not that great... and then on the other end of the sexuality spectrum, well there's this girl I've known for a long time and we end up holding hands a lot /making a lot of almost flirtatious physical contact when we're together. We kissed once quite a while back. And no I'm not one who transforms into a lesbian when drunk at a party - don't drink, I've done all this soul searching while sober. I have found myself thinking nowadays that sexual activity with other women might be more enjoyable for me.    PS: Yeah, don't know why I would've started with Yahoo Answers of all places but I saw the pretty active LGBT section. Wanna refer me to any good websites where I can seek further answers to this?

Well it was awkward cause my cousin is about 4'9" and my 16 year old brother is only 4'8". we were just playing dress up cause she loves wearing my clothes as a joke. so she wore one of my old dresses with one of my 2in. heels so now she was even taller like 5' and now clearly taller than my brother. with her being only 7 and still too young to understand how my brother feels about being so short, she really let him have it. the whole time while she wore the heels she acted like she was my brothers mommy (she has a 4 year old brohter and she thinks shes his mommy, so i guess anyone smaller than her she thinks shes the older one.) i felt bad for my brother so i tried telling her to leave him alone and stay by me and my sisters. she did until her mom came to pick her up. when my aunt walked in she couldnt believe how much taller her daughter was than my brother. her and my mom made them stand next to each other barefoot and saw that she had a couple inches on him. then when they were about to leave, my aunt wanted a picture of all of us kids. with my cousin still wearing the dress and heels she was alot taller than my brother. so my mom and aunt made us stand like in a line going from tallest to shortest so we could see all of our heads. i was in the back, twin sisters were in front of me, then our cousin, and finally our little but older brother. they took about 4 pictures each. when they left my brother got real mad at my mom and me. i didnt know what i did until he said i had to let her wear my heels. he was mad at my mom for making him stand next to our cousin knowing he was shorter and 9 years older. i feel really bad and didn't think he'd take it this hard. he hasn't come out of his room since even with my mom and me apologizing already. What should i do?

What if creation and science (not just evolution) is the same. Science can explains creation thru evolution and other types of sciences like medical science. The biggest problem between science and religion is the period. In the bible, the sun was only create on the 4 day. Therefore, 24 hours did not exist. A day and a night can be 3 months to 9 months on the poles. So even today a day and a night does not necessary mean 24 hours. A thousand years is to God a day and a day a thousand years. God is not bind by time and therefore time does not exist. The six days was more six stages. We are still living in stage seven.      Let me explain: The Universe is match more complicated as we think. In the Universe, there is no time. Everything in the universe has a DNA not only the living or organic matter. In other words, everything runs on a program. It uses steps or stages. Did you never wandered why the same things are discover at nearly the same time by differed people across the world.       People witch are able to see into the feature or the past can connect to this DNA or program. Therefore, they are not moving physically but see the future and past as if they where watching a video or DVD. To support this theory you only have to use the biggest law of physics. Energy cannot be create nor can it be destroy, it can only be transform. We learn for instance in the circle of live energy and matter is used over again. Therefore, the same energy stays in the circle. Therefore, what this is actually saying is that everything that is here, where here before and will be here again. The same energy will always be there. God knew that nothing could be destroy or create. To go back in the past or to go into the future you will need to created energy and matter to go too. Written down in the Bible and as well as Albert Einstein.      The Bible:   Ecclesiastes 3:15: “Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account”.       Albert Einstein:   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   This principle, the conservation of energy, was first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. In physics, the law of conservation of energy states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant. A consequence of this law is that energy cannot be created or destroyed. The only thing that can happen with energy in an isolated system is that it can change form, that is to say for instance kinetic energy can become thermal energy. Because energy is associated with mass in the Einstein's theory of relativity, the conservation of energy also implies the conservation of mass in isolated systems (that is, the mass of a system cannot change, so long as energy is not permitted to enter or leave the system). According to Noether's theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.
20090204224408AAI1RK3	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Am I being overly sensitive?	My husband and I moved in to our apartment in August. With-in 10 minutes after unloading the truck, the caretaker's (who happens to be the landlord's son's) wife quickly informed us of where not to park. She also informed us that we were only allowed to do laundry on Friday's (which I half expected to then rotate the laundry schedule [posted] monthly or something). We smiled and thanked her while introducing ourselves.       a month later, my husband and I were hiking and found an empty bee hive. The nature lover's we are thought it was so sweet. So, we brought it home and just to be safe (to ensure there weren't any straglers behind) we set it in the tree outside. My husband was showing his mother and the caretaker's wife walked passed. My husband commented to the caretaker on how we came across it and let her know that we would be spraying it out in the next day or so, but was just going to keep it in the tree. The next day my husband went to spray it out, and it was gone!       A few months go by (laundry schedule still not rotating) she posts a note regarding the plow guy advising us "to park cars in the garage so the plow guy can plow." My husband sells on ebay and will keep items in the garage and since we do not have a storage here we use our garage as storage [since nothing is in the lease that says we can not]. So, I wrote her a note that said something to the affect of "...Unfortunately we're not able to put our car in the garage this winter. My husband sells on ebay and we use it as storage (need an antique sewing machine? :-) ) So, if you'll kindly let me know when the plow guy plows I'll be happy to move my car around. I'll check with the city ordinances tomorrow." (oh, i work odd hours so I'm unable to have this conversation in person) I go on to say.... I don't know if it's possible to see if the plow guy is able to come while i'm at work? I work XX:XX to XX:XX most days. Would that help?"  I never heard back from her, but the plow guy came back twice a day from there on, so I didn't care.      The most recent event was when I found a sign on the door that said "The yard is not an ashtray, please pick up your cigerette butts." We have friends that do smoke, and we do not allow them to smoke in our home. So, they are required to go outside. I have told all of our friends that they should smoke down by the garbage cans. Some don't. When I see their cigerette butt, I do pick it up. When we had a gathering in our home, I put a can outside near the door and informed all guests to place butts in it. I then disposed of the can at the end of the night.      Yesterday, I came home from work and found a plaque posted to the wall in clear view near our apartment door that said "Thank you for not smoking." Ok, now I feel this is getting personal! Seriously.... it's ridiculous! NO?        Any advice? I did contact the landlord (several times) because he's needed to fix the window (it's about to fall out) and I've notified him 3-4 times about the window.

20090204235619AAiRZIT	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is there a name for our sexuality?	I'm 16 and never questioned my sexuality (always identified as straight) until four months ago.  I went through a rough time at the beginning of the school year (Drugs, Binge Drinking, Unprotected sex with multiple girls, got very close to failing several classes) and everyone important in my life tried to motivate me to get mack to my old ways, but i wasn't interested in changing my lifestyle for anyone, until i met kevin.    (In real life the guys name isn't kevin, but I'll call him that for this) I stated hanging out with this guy kevin in october, who also was straight, and we became best friends after less than a week.  I brought up my grades, quit drinking and drugs, became sexually responsible, all because of him. he made me makes me want to be a better person and i have the same effect on him. After about 5 weeks of friendship i noticed this strong sexual tension between us coming from both ways, and by the sixth week we hooked up.    It has been two moths since then, but it feels like  5 years.  We spend ever day together, call echoer "hun" and "babe", tell each-other we love each other and i consider him my boyfriend.  I cant imagine ever being with anyone else and could honestly see myself marrying him and raising kids together. i truly believe he is my sole mate and he has expressed the same feelings to me.    I dont think i am Bi, because i am not sexually attracted to any guy other than kevin, but i am insanely sexually attracted to kevin. I'm definitely not gay because i am still attracted to lots of girls, even though i would never cheat on Kevin..    I am the only guy kevin is sexually attracted too, but he is still attracted to girls.  So is there a name for our sexuality?

20090204230034AAZKkuK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For Atheists and Christians, what do you think about this?	I was an atheist at one time. And like most atheists, the issue of people believing in God bothered me greatly. What is it about atheists that we would spend so much time, attention, and energy refuting something that we don't believe even exists?! What causes us to do that? When I was an atheist, I attributed my intentions as caring for those poor, delusional people...to help them realize their hope was completely ill-founded. To be honest, I also had another motive. As I challenged those who believed in God, I was deeply curious to see if they could convince me otherwise. Part of my quest was to become free from the question of God. If I could conclusively prove to believers that they were wrong, then the issue is off the table, and I would be free to go about my life.      I didn't realize that the reason the topic of God weighed so heavily on my mind, was because God was pressing the issue. I have come to find out that God wants to be known. He created us with the intention that we would know him. He has surrounded us with evidence of himself and he keeps the question of his existence squarely before us. It was as if I couldn't escape thinking about the possibility of God. In fact, the day I chose to acknowledge God's existence, my prayer began with, "Ok, you win..." It might be that the underlying reason atheists are bothered by people believing in God is because God is actively pursuing them.      I am not the only one who has experienced this. Malcolm Muggeridge, socialist and philosophical author, wrote, "I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued." C.S. Lewis said he remembered, "...night after night, feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all of England."      Lewis went on to write a book titled, "Surprised by Joy" as a result of knowing God. I too had no expectations other than rightfully admitting God's existence. Yet over the following several months, I became amazed by his love for me.      What do you think?       http://www.everystudent.com/features/ist...

20090204235125AAdoyvr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What's your favorite bible verse?	Here's some of mine:      Exodus 2:11-12    11 One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. 12 Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.      II Kings 2:23-24    23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!" 24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.      Ezekiel 23:19-20    19 Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. 20 There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.      Judges 3:16-23    16 Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a foot and a half [a] long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing. 17 He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man. 18 After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way the men who had carried it. 19 At the idols [b] near Gilgal he himself turned back and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king."         The king said, "Quiet!" And all his attendants left him.       20 Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his summer palace [c] and said, "I have a message from God for you." As the king rose from his seat, 21 Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly. 22 Even the handle sank in after the blade, which came out his back. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it. 23 Then Ehud went out to the porch [d] ; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.      Numbers 16:23, 31-33   31 As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart 32 and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah's men and all their possessions. 33 They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.      Deuteronomy 25:11-12   11 If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts, 12 you shall cut off her hand. Show her no pity.      Judges 15:15-16    15 Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.       16 Then Samson said,          "With a donkey's jawbone          I have made donkeys of them. [a]          With a donkey's jawbone          I have killed a thousand men."      1 Samuel 18:25-27    25 Saul replied, "Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.' " Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.       26 When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, 27 David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.

He insisted that the word "dukkha" had been improperly translated as suffering. Dukkha merely meant "discontented" or "uncomfortable" and that, he said, was a far cry from suffering.       "Discontent with your social life can bring you to a sangha," I said. "The discomfort of not having a moral guide can bring you to the precepts and scriptures. We can join religious groups and then enter a kind of moral competition with other members. We can do good deeds, better deeds, or even the best of deeds. But Zen is deeper than study or fellowship or philanthropy. Zen is salvation from suffering." But I didn't convince him.

20090205004120AA0stGk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Boy oh boy alot of you folks still think an agnostic is a weak minded person who cann't make up his/her mind?	about if there is or isn't a god.  Or if we can know him or not.  But atheist and relgious folks are both way off.  Agnostics don't need to make a choice if there is or isn't a god as we understand there is no fact to make either choice a probable event.  My belief in that,    i am sure is atleast as strong or stronger than your beliefs of there being or not believing a god exists.       To me it always seems a you folks think of us agnostics as (aww you poor misguided souls)  Which always cracks me up as Religious folks are chasing after a belief that god exists.  And using the bible as fact to back up their belief.  If god is a belief doesn't that make the bible a belief also???  You have a book (the bible) which tells you you need to have faith in god  Doesn't that tell you right there that your faith is about a belief?  In my book a belief is something which may or may not be ture.  To me most religious folks seems to think your belief somehow  becomse fact,  The same for the atheist which say there is no god as if they know something the rest of us don't know.  Why does your belief of no god make it fact?

I wrote this a few days ago just seeing if I reach anybody else...anywayz..   i am 22 years old i came out at age 15 as bi 17 as a lesbian and just a few months back i shared w/ a few of my close friends(that have kept my secret that i trust w all my heart) that i think i am transgendered. i have always thought myself as a "boy" my whole life but didnt really think about it till i was 20 and most people that barely know or know me well say things like "wow ur so much like a guy" or "your like the best of both worlds" for the most part i dress in guy cloths but sometimes i wear girly clothes. i always have had my hair long i just pull it back i wear make up and straighten my hair most days but i can not get out of my mind that i want nothing but to wake up and b a guy and its constantly on my mind. i know i only like women and have only been w/ women since i was 16 but i sometimes check guys out not sexually but in a jelous way like i want to b like them or look like them. i have known many trans people but i feel i dont fully fit in. i feel i dont fit in w/ other lesbians and i dont fit in fully w/ my girl friends (like when they go shoping etc) or my guy friends (when im w/ a group of them) but most my guy friends treat me like one of the guys(b/c im a butch lesbian not b/c i really feel my brain is that of a male) im just me, i am an amazing person who truly is one of a kind..im rather popular and have a lot of cool accepting people in my life, but i am too scared to fully come out b/c i think that transitioning would not make me happy b/c i would still feel like a "fake guy" w/ a crappy penis..and i get a lot of cute girls now and feel i wouldnt if i went any butcher and came out as trans and wanted the pro-nouns changed. its hard enough being accepted as gay by strangers but trans? i really wish the ftm surgery n such were as advanced as the mtf =( i guess i am asking are there trans people that do not want surgery? if so would being called he/him and going by a different name and coming out trans and trying to look like a guy but never fully transition help make u feel more whole? my question is for some advice from ftm's or from lesbians who may feel somewhat like me or anyone that has any helpful advice at all. i just feel alone and confused. thanks a lot 4 reading and responding!

20090205004716AAPPNVC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My life is like a drama show. I hate life, how can all this be happening to me?	I only have one friend who I hang out with after school and my cousin told me she was crazy because she talks to herself. Now, I don't have no one to hang out with after school. I'm quiet by the way so it's hard to make new friends.       I'm gay and no one knows except my two cousins. He told me that I shouldn't tell ANYONE until I finish high school because he's scared that I might be beaten up or what ever.      I have been in love 3 times but was too scared to say anything because they might be straight. This 3rd guy, the most recent guy I liked, called me "quiet and boring" and said that I am only "good company". I feel so hurt.      My cousins are not good for advice, they don't agree with my being a homosexual and I have no one to talk to. I only had one friend who knows I'm gay but I couldn't contact her lately so I feel so alone and I have no one to talk to about all of this stress.      I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I really don't.      The worst part is that even though the guy I liked called me boring and stuff, I'm still gonna hang out with him because I have no one else.      To make the situation worst, tomorrow that psychotic girl wants to hang out with me and she's kinda "Clingy" always following me around and stuff.      I know no one on the internet probably cares about this but I don't know what to do with myself anymore because I have no one to talk to.

I came across a video about Fred Phelps on youtube.com. He calls himself a preacher. He has a "church" called the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. This guy has made his life's goal hating gays. Not only does he speak out against homosexuals, which is fairly common among many Christian churches, but he actually protests them. He and his followers go to gay-pride marches, gay clubs, and gay neighborhoods with signs, bullhorns, and hundreds of people. He is openly hateful, and he sees no problem hating these innocent people, which kind of seems a bit backwards to me, considering he calls himself a 'Christian'. I suppose it is one thing for him to be opposed to gays and speak against them.. It is his right as an American. But this evil man takes it to a whole new level. I saw a video of a protest that showed his college age grand-daughters. They were pretty, normal looking, young women. However, as soon as they opened their mouths, the seething, poisonous, hatred that has been ingrained into their very being became evident. He is brainwashing these people to hate as he does!

Every family is dysfuntional to some degree. What I mean by non-dysfunctional, is the closest thing to it. Specifically, how many of you were raised with both parents (not divorced), and for the most part, happy to be together (for real)?     And how many of you had good relationships with your parents before you told them you were not straight?    One last thing, were your parents of good health, (not obese), but healthy for the most part, and not in poverty?    After a fun conversation with one of my friends, who actually is gay, about sexual orientation and upbringing, I started thinking about this further. So I figured to ask you all to get some outside info to dig deeper into our disscussion.    For the record, my parents were miserable, and had a dramatically ugly seperation.    Your thoughts?

My girlfriend has made it a point to tell me a few times she's straight and not into girls. But something isnt right...      The other day my hard drive melted and i couldnt use my computer. So I called and asked my gf if I can use her laptop to quickly check my e-mail because it was important, she said fine. So I open it up and she already had the web browser minimized, so I opened it and the site she was looking at was lesbian porn.      I just closed it and went on about my business. But should I ask her about this? Or wait for her to say something.... I know she's not a lesbian because she loves having sex with me. But I just find it werd because it contradicts everything she's told me.

20090204235744AA8xiqZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question for Atheists... why do Christians have to hate Atheists?	The following is a question I asked of my fellow Christians the other day. I would greatly appreciate your take on it and your opinions about what I have to say. :)    --Okay fellow Christians, why do we have to hate atheists?--    Seriously, apparently I wasn't invited to a meeting or something, because I just don't understand how what I believe about God is supposed to lead me to atheist bashing. Didn't God want us to love one another as He loves us? I'm pretty sure he loves the atheists and the lesbians, and yes, even George W. Bush. So why does it seem like there must be something in our doctrine that says we have to bash them and refuse to listen to anything they have to say? And why does it make sense to go around looking for questions atheists have asked and answer them with a "Because God said so and you're going to burn in Hell"... do you really think you're going to get anywhere that way? Personally, if I was spoken to as I have seen some atheists spoken to on these boards, I might not want to give Christianity a chance either.      "It says in the Bible that all who deny Christ are liars and Anti-Christs and need to be killed." -- An ACTUAL answer I got... Seriously? People like this make me wonder what God they believe in, because He's certainly not the same guy I know and love!

I said it was hierarchical, biased against women, and repulsed me... then they asked what I thought of Jesus, I replied, if Jesus ever existed I think he probably was a good guy but would himself be repulsed by what organized religion had done with his name, with the crusades, child molestations by priests, and money gathering and hording operations of the church... strangely enough, the women seemed to agree with my assessment as if even they questioned the morality of it all

20090205014136AA96XC8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The God / Parent Respect Anology Question?	I've read many postings that said that God deserves the same respect from us as do our parents, and yet I see an incredibly large number of truly horrendous parents.  Most conceptions are for reasons of personal pleasure (sometimes forced rape) and not from people actively trying to concieve (though that too does occur).  Once concieved parents often consider giving up or aborting, expecially when the pregnancy is unwanted.  After birth, children are sometimes loved and provided good lives, but are on another hand sometimes severely abused and treated beyond imagining.  Do the horrible parents deserve respect? I myself think, not, that instead parents are to earn the respect of their children by being good parents.  This to me ties over to God (if you believe in God), allows or even places a child into the hands of such care, or makes it so a child is born alergic to their own skin, or horrible deformed and without real hope, well does such a God deserve any respect from such children (or from anyone opposed to any child being born to such crueless and then be judged for how they grow up given such unfair handicaps in life)?  I again think not, but am willing to hear what others think.

A lethal dose seems to be around 500mg or so and that would probably end up being about $250 (according to someone else who asked here)... I'm thinking less than $100, give or take a few.   -easy access. setting is some big party, lol.    - something fairly common, not some really obscure drug that teens would never get their hands on.       I was originally looking into ketamine but apparently it's not very common to overdose on it, although the symptoms fit very well for what I was thinking. I believe I read that there have been 7 deaths due to it nationwide? I want it to be fairly realistic, although I may have to choose ketamine if there's nothing else. xD

20090205005718AABAr3W	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What Are Your Thoughts On The Black Woman?	Let me start by saying I don't want an argument! I want honest, respectful opinions and general analysis'.       Ok, I want to know why the perception of the Black Woman's beauty and worth so degraded & devalued in our society? I hear a lot that because we're degraded so much in our own culture by our Black Men, that it has damaged our quality in the eyes of some Men who are not Black. I do believe that the way we are portrayed in Hip-Hop and the media doesn't put us in the best light. But there are many negative stereo-types attached to Women of other races, but it's still always US who live at the bottom of the food chain because we're Black Women. It's a huge problem that we have, and people still don't like to acknowledge that it exists. In your best judgment of opinion, help me understand from your POV what you think about this issue; Is it truly a Hip-Hop/Cultural thing or something that's gone over my head? I'd also like those who aren't American to give some input as well.      P.S. I will be responding to answers, so please check back and add more opinion at will.      Thank You :)

If I want to send her some roses (I don't have the money to buy from a florist and get them delivered), will they be decent looking after 2 weeks.  I guess I can tie a small plastic bag with some water on them.  But will they be dead by the time they get there?

20090204230035AALyPvm	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why Do People Hate Bisexuals?	Why is it that so many people hate bisexuals? I mean seriously, girls won't date bi guys because they obviously are going to, "crave cock". The same goes for gay guys, simply because I won't commit to just their gender it's apparently obvious I'm going to cheat on them to get towards my irrational love of the female anatomy. I'm just so frustrated of why people feel this way. I guess I'm asking for advice on how to handle people who turn me down on the basis of being bi, and secondly I'm wondering what experiences people have had/heard of being with bisexuals that give us such a shady rap as a group.

Let's say my formal boss wanted to make plans with me or better yet, if he was still my boss and if he is in charge of me, and I told him: "I cant hang tonight. I got to work." (thats if he is no longer my boss) but if he is still my boss and wants to do something with me after work and I say to him: "I cant tonight. I have other plans."      Would this be kind of weird? Especially because he is in charge of the schedule?      And if he used to be in charge of me and in charge of the schedule and I tell him I have a tight busy schedule, wont this be kind of weird that I am telling my own old former boss this and he may be able to take advantage and make the decision of when I come to work or not.

Afterall, she is the new girl and she is the one showing me how to do the job.      Now think of it this way. What if this new girl who started after I did, what if she ends up becoming my boss and I am the one who trained her? Wont this be very weird and awkward that I have to listen to her and obey her?      Its the same thing as a cashier putting up their closed sign up on their co-worker who trained them.

I started going to church about a year ago, but then stopped because I started night shift and was always tired, then I started going again a few weeks ago.  I'm still having problems with something I've always struggled with, it seems like I have no faith.  I want to believe that God is watching me and there for me, I see all the people in my church who are so sure that God is real, but some part of me almost refuses to believe it.  But another part of me wants to experience the peace that everybody talks about.  I haven't told anyone about this at church, not even my wife knows.  Everyone just assumes I believe, but I'm just so lost.  Why can't God just say something like, "Hey (my name here) I'm real and I love you."  I mean he appeared to people back in the day so why can't he talk with me.  I've prayed for something like that to happen but it hasn't yet.  I just don't know what to do now.

Plus I dress pretty feminine because I wear skinny jeans and I'm into wearing ethnic things almost bohemian like.  The way I act is stopping me from doing my full potential. I'm a sophomore right now and I've been the president for the past two years and involved in jrotc. It will probably stop me from getting into the Naval Academy or any military service academy.  But I'm just not a regular person I'm not into sports like football, or basketball, i'm into tennis and feminine sports like gymnastics. Sometimes I wonder If I'm gay.

Okay, unfortunatly you are only allowed so many words and referances to yourself when you ask questions. So I simply would like to add, I have nothing against either party, I personally felt very good about Obama's election, seeing as how he was my candidate of choice. It is just that I had the worst dream of my life, and for the first few days I thought it had really occured. I just really need to know if this is a product of an over active imagination, or if other supporters had a simular occurance. Just keep in mind when responding, I am a VERY sceptical person, so for me to post this is a little uncomfortable.

20090205011607AAu4lsJ	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Wife's Harassment. Please advice?	I approach you here with a heavy heart.I need someone to talk with & advice me.      My wife & their family members harass me. I am married since on year. Recently we have got a one month old son. My wife is an accountant & does her own work.      In the begining she was very calm, as I could not recoginze her personality, as she did not talk much. We were just engaged for two months before we got married. We live in the same city. It was our arranged marriage. I just have my mom in my family.      She keeps running away from my home to her place, without letting anyone know..she loves her mom too much, that she ignores me. I am not against it, but she does not see that what is right & wrong. Every week, she goes to her place & stays for few days. My mom's around 70 yrs old. She can't do much house work. Though we've a servant, who does washing, cleaning & dishes etc. So my wife has to just cook. My mom helps her. We have a quite & religious atmosphere.      My wife finds small faults in me. I never tried to did that. What she did not understand, I used to explain her. The customs of my home & so on....      I've kept by clam against his habit. . I am sure one day, she will realize her mistake.  When I used to go at her place to call her back, her family members use to support her decision & say, that she has done nothing wrong. I was just asking her to inform me, before going to her home, so that we will not worry. Now, we have a one month old child. But things have not changed. I am worried about my child. Yesterday there was a fight regarding the name to be given to the child. She never talked to me about this. After 30 days of birth, birth registration has to be done, so I had to give the child name. In our community name is decided by husband's relatives. When I suggested a name, she started saying bad things to me & said, I don't have right on my child, as she has given birth. I felt hurt & I also reacted in anger. She is mentally torching me. She has done this lot of times. But all the time, i had approached her to calm down the things.Even if I am not wrong, I don't mind saying, "Sorry", if things improve, which I always do. She never approached me. The another thing is that, her mom keeps poking her fingers into my family matters. She also makes her mom jump into such matters which are concerned for just two of us. I had pointed towards it. Her mom theratns that she will not send her daughter back to my home. We are just two persons in the family. My mom & me. I think they are trying to take the advantage of us. It's now one year of marriage. I cannot handle stress. I cannot concentrate in my work. I cannot sleep. I dont' want to stress my mom. I dont want to fight & get engaged in legal battles. I am a simple family man. Please advice. I need someone to talk with. What type of behaviour I should do against her. I cannot think about anything. Her family is not letting me to see my son also. My son is the only born baby in my family, since many years, after i was born, so we are very much attached to him. I feel like crying. Life's been to hard on me. .... Thank you. I await friends advice. Please guide me. Thank you.

If God cannot forgive the unrepentant, because he cannot dwell with sin and the only way to expunge sin is to cast it into Hell, how is it that Jesus could be punished by a mere three days of death?  If sin (Jesus) is expunged merely by spending three days in death, why does a sinner require eternity in Hell?

20090205030317AATdIif	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Mainly, the "not too bright" were attracted to christianity in the early church?	Celsus, in the 2nd century, wrote:      [The Christians'] injunctions are like this. "Let no one educated, no one wise, no one sensible draw near. For these abilities are thought by us to be evils. But as for anyone ignorant, anyone stupid, anyone uneducated, anyone who is a child, let him come boldly."    (Against Celsus 3.44)      Moreover, we see that those who display their secret lore in the marketplaces and go about begging would never enter a gathering of intelligent men, nor would they dare to reveal their noble beliefs in their presence? but whenever they see adolescent boys and a crowd of slaves and a company of fools, they push themselves in and show off.    (Against Celsus 3.50)      In private houses also we see woolworkers, cobblers, laundry workers, and the most illiterate and bucolic yokels, who would not dare to say anything at all in front of their elders and more intelligent masters. But whenever they get hold of children in private and some stupid women with them, they let out some astonishing statements, as, for example, that they must not pay any attention to their father and school teachers. . .? they say that these talk nonsense and have no understanding.. . . But, if they like, they should leave father and their schoolmasters, and go along with the women and little children who are their playfellows to the wooldresser's shop, or to the cobbler's or the washerwoman's shop, that they may learn perfection. And by saying this they persuade them.    (Against Celsus 3.56)      --------------------------------------   BTW....Origen, an early church father, didnt deny these criticisms when refuting other of Celsus' critiques of Christianity

20090205024955AAsX0hd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Was the term "atheist" or "atheism" as an idea as prominent 20 years ago compared to recent years?	Because I was only born in the early 90s and during my childhood I heard basically nothing about atheism in the media, from friends or from family. So I'm unsure if this is an actual trend in contemporary society, or if this lack of growing up with the idea of atheism is just because I was less exposed to a wider culture when I was younger?
20090205060048AAz9vL0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do Christians who believe in eternal life think?	about these excerpts:    Eccles: 9:5 10:"As for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all"      New Catholic Encyclopedia: "The soul in the O.T means not a part of man, but the whole man - man as a living being. Similiarly, in the N.T it signifies human life{...] the Bible does not speak of the survival of an immaterial soul."      Luther: (Evangelischer Erwachsenenkatechismus) :   "Since man as a whole is a sinner, therefore at death he dies completely with body and soul."      Although there is vague talk of "many mansions" in another life, these extracts are totally clear that there is no life after death.      Yet they (and others similarly) are definitely not largely taught. It seems that encouraging belief in eternal life is a good way of socialising people and taming them.   Even before Jesus and for centuries after Jesus, religions did NOT teach eternal life, including the Jews and Christians. Somehow, somewhere, the message got mixed up. Who profits from the crime?

You see a lot not about how men who take hormones, get implants, get there adams apple removed, and get their penis changed into a vagina. And then they're legally a woman. They can get married to a man, so because they get things changed does that mean that they're not gay, or it's okay in god eyes to do that? Or what about those people who are sometimes both with both parts, what about them?       And no I'm not anti-gay, or anti-transgender. I'm a christian who doesn't understand why God says being Gay is a sin. I'm just curious cause the bible doesn't speak about it, well I don't think it does because well it's a new thing in our time.

There is a really big cult (they call it a church but whatever) that are right across the road from my place.  I am in no way religious and think the whole idea is stupid.      Anyway, I have horses and often take my thoroughbred out for a trail ride on Sundays.  But the church people are usually out the front and they cross the road and demand to know why I'm not at church.      They did this 4 weeks in a row and I told them to go away but a few weeks ago I got really angry and went off at them.  I told them to basically pull their head in and I'd rather shoot myself than pick church over horse riding.      What makes them think that this is okay?  I've got better things to do than be preached to.  Now if they try to talk to me I canter away and tell them to F off and get a real hobby.
20090205052349AA7Ijwc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If the Bible is The Word of God, then why did he leave it open to so many different interpretations?	Even within the Protestant faith, there are so many different denominations because of different interpretations of various passages and verses, some held in prominence, and some seemingly ignored.   And then also you have Catholicism, Judaism, etc...all assuming that their interpretation is also the correct one.      Please don't tell me that since the Bible was written by men (who are all flawed), it is man's fault that it was not written/translated as God would truly have it. GOD IS GOD, and has the power to command & make things so.      Considering it's your soul that's in mortal jeopardy, shouldn't God have made the one, true way clear? You don't see much leeway for misunderstanding with technical manuals, explaining how to do something. (well, unless you're unlucky and it's only in Japanese...)      So, is God purposely confusing people, or is he just poor at explaining things?
20090205024846AAbGhtf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did God really make a mistake?	I have always wondered why God would make such a mistake as he did when he created the angels.      If he knew that the angels were going to want to spawn with humans, why did he originally give angels the ability to reproduce?       What happened to the nefilim? (The children of angels and humans) Did God take care of them, or did he forsake them because they were abominations?      And why didn't God know that this was going to happen, and instead of taking away the angel's ability to reproduce, just create the angels without the ability instead?      All this assuming that God exists of course.      Thanks! :-)

20090205025741AA4jRMW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is this a claim made by a lot of atheist?	Atheists like to point to the fact that religion and specifically Christianity does not keep to itself and that is why it is not hypocritical for them to spread their propaganda. They however miss this point. The wars that have been fought and all the injustices that have occurred in the name of Christianity does not have anything to do with God. Those were humans own stupid decisions. This quote sums it up best, "The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried." - G.K. Chesterton. It is illogical to claim that something done by someone who claims to be a christian is proof that a religion is bad anymore than someone can say that proof atheism is bad occurs when an atheist commits a crime.

My brother is a TV. he never told me he was - but I have seen his clothes and make-up and my brothers and my parents have seen him dressed up.      I should add that he had a girlfriend who he broke up with - shortly after this he developed his Sczphenia. could his Schezephrenia be caused as he cant express his feminine side?   He was diagonosed with schizophrenia when he was 29 - he was put on heavy medication and he had a bad few years - he is now 44 and his doctor has said he is well enough to come off his meds. He came off his meds in September of 2008.      my old brother who we all love dearly has returned to a great extent. he is speaking lucidly and is very much his old self.   However he has now started dressing up again and yesterday he called up to me and stole quite a lot of underwear and a dress of mine. he was wearing a dress under his clothes too. He has also taken to drinking a bottle of wine every morning which is totally unheard of for him - we all love a drink but he was the one who never got drunk and could drink socially. Please dont be side tracked in to thinking he has a drink problem.      We just dont know what to do - he lives with his elderly mother and she is worried sick. he also suffers from emphysemia from smoking so cant work.      what should we do? I love him dearly but I have 2 small girls and i dont want them to take against him should they see him dressed up or even going tru my wardrobe and nicking stuff.      Should I say it to him?   The most important thing is that we live in a tiny village - a gay man was burned out of his house last year - that kind of place.   If it gets out that he is TV his life and his mums wont be worth living. He doesnt seem 100% sane alot of the time and sometimes he still talks rubbish but the voices etc have stopped.      please answer if you are a TV and know what i am talking about    thanks

" If you are interesting Al A*** institute are pleased to provide an opportunity to skill you for the IELTS exam through our intensive course as follows". It then reverts to Arabic thank goodness.      And this is the revised version after I had made a complaint about the previous advert!      I wouldn't mind so much if they were not charging students for the course!

20090205032919AAq4meA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Latter Day Saints and Mormons?	Hi      Earlier today some Latter Day Saints spoke to me and being overly polite I felt awkward saying anything bad to them and ended up giving them my home number.      Are they the same as mormons?  They sounded American (although their accents were much more neutral than most Americans; not sure if the region mormons are from has a particularly neutral accent).        If so, are mormons as bad as people put them out to be?  Are they really a polygamist cult?  They seemed like stand up guys (ie really nice) so I find it hard to believe they were cultists, and at first I thought they were Jehovas Witnesses or something.  I feel kind of awkward since I may get a call from cultists later but if someone can tell me that they are not as bad as they are put out to be it will be less awkward.      Btw their titles were 'elder' - does this make them high or low ranking in the Latter Day Saint church?      Thanks

I am 20 years old.   I live with my mom.   I am out of work.   I haven’t left home in 2 weeks straight.   I have, for some reason, horrible memory. I used to be really good at remembering stuff.   Thats just the starting point. Let me list all of the other things:   1. I’ve never dated before. Not once. I’ve been asked out I think at least 5 times by women/girls (whichever you prefer), but each time I’ve somehow managed to screw it up even before I could say yes to any of them.   2. In highschool I: A. Never went to Tolo. B. Never went to prom. C. Never went to any school dance or event period.   3. I still play videogames.   4. I watch anime.   5. I’m a virgin.   6. By my families standards, I’m really immature.   7. I went to college for 2 months, but dropped out afterwards.   8. In general I hate other males.   9. I think I could be bi. Which is technicaly a problem for me.   10. I’ve never been to a waterpark before.   11. I don’t drive, nor do ever plan to, and have only driven twice, the second time I crashed the car.   12. I jumped houses for 4 years straight.   13. I have had at least…I can’t remember…4 to 5 jobs now I think.   14. I’ve never danced before.   15. I’ve only been outside of the country twice.   16. I have no talents. (Unless you consider basic house cleaning a talent and/or videogame playing).   17. I haven’t hung out with anyone in a VERY long time.   18. I do not believe I have any real friends…I only have 4 online friends.   19. I believe the world is going to end in 2012.   20. I know for a fact that I have more enemies than I do friends.   21. I think I need help. Please help. Anyone. Seriously.

And why do they say the British accent is so elegant and intelligent sounding.       In fact I always say that I would like to give any North American who asked for a British accent because it sounds so 'elegant' and 'intellectual' and 'proper'  a Geordie accent (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) or a Brummie accent (Birmingham). Then I'd ask them if they still think they sound 'elegant' lol      And I'm not knocking Geordies or Brummies neither - I have a thick Geordie accent but I know I don't sound remotely 'elegant'.

My Darling Karen and Peter,      I apologize for being so late writing but as soon as I got back, I had to do loads of things and Ive been really busy.     Im just writing to say many thanks for inviting me to holiday with you in Torquay. Its just as well the weather was exceptional and we could do a lot of activities outdoors. I had a marvellous time. I hope so did you.    I had never imagined this town could be so beautiful with its Victorian villas and terraces gaze out to sea. It was fantastic to visit Kents Cavern, the beautiful gardens and listen to street musicians entertaining people with everything from opera to jazz.    When I got to Alicante I was given some nice news. At last I was going to be independent!  My city council had given me a council housing! So Ive been very busy moving for the last month. I had to paint, buy some furniture and organize my new home. I think my flat looks very lovely in accordance with my personality. But one thing's certain; now I have to work harder at my new home than at my parents. I had a big house-warming party for my friends and we had a lot of fun but the following day I had to promise my neighbours not to make so fuss next time.    Ill tell you more things another day. Thanks again for everything and I expect you to come to Alicante very soon just as you promised me. Any season is good to visit my city as the sun is almost always shining.      Lots of love      Mara      PS I enclose a photo of the three of us in Paignton Zoo

20090205060229AAGyPAE	Society & Culture;Languages	Is there any mistake in the discourse?	Should government close all the private schools?   Nowadays   there are many private schools built in many countries   and none of governments want to close them   competition is always the advisable way to improve cultures in all the areas,and it also propel cultures improved with great efficiency and high speed.   if the government closes the private schools for the government doesnt believe the education in private schools and the government do it for protecting the education for students,then it will just be like girls who like dressing up herself beautiful to break up the mirror.then how could the girl knows herself.except she is too ugly to break it.   private school is the mirror for government schools,and also a stress for them to make sure that their teaching way up to date on time and never be out of the competition in education field   competition is always the important thing in pushing cultures progresses,   competition makes us to word hard,makes girls to make up.makes men to read more.makes us getting out of indolence   people have a simple fashionable hair-cut in Guangzhou,it just costs u about 15 Yuan,but if u take it in KL,at least cost u about 35 ringgit,this is because the competition in Guangzhou is violent,and u can always see another same type of shops nearby.   A violent competition between businessmen will aways course conveniences to consumers,and it will always push them to make sure qualities in their producks.otherwase,they will be out of the stage of competition.   and this was the reasion why monkey became human being.   for instance.computers were expensive,its because there was just only one computer company able to produce it.and many of us can afford it today,its not because we became richer,its just because the competition makes the price of computer cheper.and why do we need to get a computer today ,its also because the competition made it useful in many ways.    If the government closes the private schools,it will jam the way of the improving education fild.or slow down the improving speed of it.private school is just like a mirror for government school,if there are many parents prefer sending their chilren to private schools,it will just mean that government schools should improve themselves to adapt this challange of education filed.and to provide the demands to parents,and they dont need to think about what do they need to improve about ,they can just get the answer directly from private schools which suck out thire students.A boss of private school runs his school as doing a businese,they will always think about what parents want,and be close to parents,and listen to their wishes on their children,then they will try to provide the things to them.otherwise they will be starving.thats the resion why are private schools always choosed by rich parents.   Government schools have financial supports from government,there has no any reasion for them to be worse as they face private schools   because the teaching quality is always the main thing for the gov to do,they cant be stingy to invest the money in edication filed,its because that serving a good education to students is also doing a action of developing our country in the future   Thank u

Leave that open." And I give him a weird look and I am like: "Do you mind? Am I not allowed to go to the bathroom?" and he was like keeping an eye on me and watching me in the bathroom because he was worried I was going to goof off and text with not getting back to work because people do that alot at work but I CERTAINLY NEVER DO. The point is, does he have a right to tell me to leave the door open and keep an eye on my while I am taking a dump?
