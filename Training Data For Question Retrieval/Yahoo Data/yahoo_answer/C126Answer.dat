wqeAeSVYaa	Geez, use some protection.  You are playing Russian Roulette with your vagina.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	About 20% of women who are actively trying to conceive get pregnant during the first month so I'm guessing your chances of being pregnant are right around there.  The physical symptoms you describe can also be caused by PMS or even from stress so I wouldn't assume anything from those.      If you are trying to get pregnant, I wouldn't worry about not being the pregnant the first month.  If you don't want to get pregnant, I would definitely stop having unprotected sex even if the test comes back negative.  If you get lucky this month, it does not mean you will be lucky next month.  Sooner or later, it will happen if you keep having unprotected sex.|`|DutTBV3caa	well my husband and i got pregnant somewhere between 3-5 days after mine.   you can get pregnant anytime.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I don't understand questions like this. Why would you,if you're so worried about it,not just use protection?!? I don't understand this at all. Yes,you had sex on your most fertile day/days. You could be pregnant,so don't be surprised if the blood test is a BFP. Get over it,you're the one that was stupid and didn't use protection.|`|O2fI6Ju7aa	Its possible, because women usually ovulate at day 14 if they have a 28 day cycle.     It could be pms? maybe?|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Yup, you're knocked up alright. Start picking names.|`|JXXZIsBvaa	1) ANY time you have sex, you can get pregnant.  and   2) If you are so terrified of that possibility why the hell weren't   you using protection??    sex=baby|`|zJGju89Eaa	All signs point to you being pregnant. You can get pregnant anytime during the month, plus the test doesn't respond 'til about 3 weeks after having sex.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It sounds like you took the pregnancy test too soon.  There is a good chance you are pregnant, so I hope that is what you wanted.  I didn't get a positive test until my period was 5 days late.|`|ulH28Fibaa	I have to agree...why would u do that. atleast take the pill, or something like that.  atleast then you know u wont get pregnant|`|YseGAHIfaa	HCG may not be present yet coz you took the test too early!  you should take the test on the day of your period [if it doesn't come] - that way it'll be much more reliable. you are most fertile generally 14 days after your last menstrual cycle [depending on your cycle] & sperm can live inside you for upto 5 days! so, you could be pregnant!     lots of luck..!! x|`|gDvqoxZVaa	U do have symptoms. U will b sure 2 morrow. But ur chances are really about the same any day of the month. They just increase maybe about 5% some days. I got a positive HPT yesterday and will find out 2morrow for sure also. GOOD LUCK
TXddP0uxaa	The absence of a period does not mean she cannot get pregnant.  The pill is never more than 99.9% effective.    EDIT:  Many women experience lack of a period when on the pill.  I experience the same thing, my doctor said that was perfectly normal.  A woman who is experiencing it though, should see the doctor and make sure the lack of period is a consequence of the pill and not from some other issue.|`|vue9NOhYaa	She needs to speak to her doctor.  The pill, taken in the correct way (3 weeks on/1 week off) should not cause her to not have periods. (The 'periods' a woman gets while on the pill have nothing to do with ovulation.  Even a woman who doesn't ovulate normally should get regular withdrawal bleeds while on the pill. In fact, doctors often put annovulatory women ON the pill for this very reason -- to trigger regular bleeds.)    So your girlfriend needs to see her gyn to determine why she isn't  having regular bleeds at the end of every pack.  This isn't normal, and isn't healthy.    EDIT: Skipping an occassional period on the pill is normal. It is NOT normal or common to stop having periods altogether.  (If a woman never has periods, she is at high risk for endometrial cancer.)|`|JXXZIsBvaa	So you are saying she has gone through menopause?  If she has that means her eggs are done and you would think that means she can't get pregnant lol.  I don't think she can if she doesn't have eggs..|`|44b45a8b96f8d0476454742310e53b31aa	She can get pregnant
mx3gFmIKaa	Perimenopausal symptoms happen a good 10 years before menopause.  I honestly don't know if it has to do with the oophorectomy or not, the other ovary should still be functional and I wouldn't think it would effect it.  Removing one ovary though does decrease your fertility, ovaries generally alternate left one this month, right one next, so either the ovary that is left picks up the slack or you only ovulate 6x/yr versus 12.    I had secondary infertility and was unable to conceive at age 30, I was told I was perimenopausal.  With fertility drugs and an RE I did manage to have 2 babies one at 32yrs 10 months, one at 33 yrs 11 months.|`|enqNTpzXaa	Menopause is actually a time of life to celebrate. Celebrate your new freedom. Soon, you'll not have to bother with monthly periods and cramps. You'll never again have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy. Those dismal mood swings will even out and you won't get so emotional about little things.    Menopause should be called "Graduation". When you were just a little girl, life was easy and simple, and then you became a woman. Estrogen coursed through your body, you became fertile, with monthly periods. You had children, or perhaps didn't.    But now, you've paid your dues. You've been there and done that. Your ovaries are saying, "That's enough! We're finished with that phase of life." The estrogen that was gushing through your system is diminishing, and the body is adjusting.    You're graduating to a Mature Woman who is healthy, strong, intelligent and finally free of those responsibilities of being fertile. Rejoice and celebrate, because the best is yet to come, girl!

The Sudafed will help with congestion and a runny nose, and the Tylenol for sinus pressure pain, fever, and headache.  Hope you feel better!|`|i8Ch743Laa	I have a list of meds right here actually,that my dr gave me.

CY8jAXPDaa	Hi Hun,   I had a Newborn - To infant book.  It stated in there that a baby becomes an infant rather than a newborn at 6weeks old.  I know a lot of people have wrote on here that they become infants at 3 mos but, in my book it never said that, and it was a very popular book.      ETA - Hunters Mom, i received a book through from bounty this morning called 'becoming a toddler'   My son turns a year old on Monday, so it states that baby's become toddlers when becoming 12mos old, because that's usually when baby's start toddling about.    I've also just looked it up on the internet and again it stated 6 weeks old they aren't classed at newborn anymore.|`|NpomCCjUaa	Good question!    I'd been wondering about this too. Books say that you "can't spoil a newborn", and I'd been wondering how long that lasted for, and when I was supposed to start worrying that I am spoiling him.|`|UYU1kapPaa	I think around 6 to 8 weeks of age.|`|iF2pL6dZaa	after 6 weeks|`|GNgp759Yaa	hmm interesting i have never thought of that before but i would say around 2 months|`|tsoc9tihaa	i work in a kids clothes shop  we do sizes    'newborn'  and the 'up to one month'  so im guessing.  about a month.|`|1dueLOdvaa	I stopped considering my kids newborns when they were 3 months old.|`|QCVzUC1baa	I think they are considered a newborn up until about 4 weeks or a month old.|`|qjDxKXENaa	after 6 weeks but my little girl who is 5 and a half months old is still my baby.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	28 days after birth they change from a newborn to an infant.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	I say 3 months.    0-3 months - newborn  3-12 months - baby  12 - 36 months - toddler  36 months + - child    That's the way I see it anyway!|`|7gde2DRraa	Thats actually a good question!  I've always wondered the same thing!  I'm curious to know the answer also!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	3 months. The first 3 months are considered the 4th trimester by some. It's the amount of time most babies need to adjust to the outside world. This is when colic normally ends and some babies start to sleep better.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	0-3 months they are considered newborns...after that they are considered infants.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Medically, it's 28 days after original date of consignment, not actual birth date, but I still consider them a newborn till they are 2 or 3 months old, I think to, it depends on the size of the baby.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	usually at  a month they are considered that they are an infant|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	I always wondered this, i'd personally say about 3 months.. I always wondered when your baby isn't considered a baby anymore and is now a toddler?! My daughter is 13months and I still refer to her as a baby even though she is very independant. I guess she will always be my baby.. awwww lol|`|yCwPxulYaa	3 months old is when they are no longer considered newborn in the medical world.    When you stop referring to them in weeks in usually around 3 months also.|`|72DBWVBOaa	2 months|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I would say after a month or 6 weeks old.|`|JP2h62qiaa	yeah. For real. When is a toddler a toddler? I want to know this.  I want to know what to properly call my son.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	3 months i say|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I just read this in my Medical Terminology book. Birth to 28 days of life they are consindred a newborn. After that the "baby" is an infant. Hope that helps.
NysFTExhaa	My mother never got a positive on a hpt with me or my brother, she had to go into a doctor to get a blood test done each time.   When I got pregnant with my boys it was so faint that you really couldn't tell if it was a positive or not.     I do know that there are people who get period-like bleeding when they're pregnant.  If you miscarried or think you miscarried you should get it confirmed with your doctor.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I got negative tests but wasn't getting a regular period for 2 months.  I was also just tired, no morning sickness or anything.  It's possible but it's the exception.  When you went to the gyno, did you say anything to him or her?  You could always get a blood test at the doctors and that would definitely tell you, but it sounds like you're not pregnant.|`|ROJans2Taa	im sure it's possible but very rare, and if you were at the gyno I wouldn't worry. I had bleeding from 5-11 weeks but I got positive tests, you could always make up some ailment just to an u/s done if your really worried, they probably wont give you one if you say you think your pregnant despite the neg tests. good luck|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yes they are true, its very rare but they are true|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	no i don't believe they are true.    there is a show on discovery health (its a special) about women who never knew they were pregnant and ended up 'unexpectedly' giving birth....they were all women who - for whatever reason - didn't have periods (obesity, premenapausal, etc) ....there wasn't any stories of women who kept getting their periods, or that kept taking tests that all said negative.    i think 99% of those stories are old wives tales or women who exagerratte symptoms - ie, i kept getting a period and i wasn't showing....means i really never kept track and was overweight to begin with.|`|LiPoEBenaa	It's true but very uncommon! Also since your dr didn't notice anything when you went in a few weeks ago, I highly doubt you're pregnant. When the dr does the pap smear they take cells from around the cervix and if you're pregnant the cervix would have been a purple-ish color. The doctor would have definitely noticed! Plus at 4 months the movement that I felt was so minimal I couldn't tell if it was gas or the baby and I knew I was pregnant.|`|xy5UNiELaa	I think those stories would be very rare.  Maybe you should get a blood test.  At this point, a HPT should show a positive.  And most first timers don't feel movement until 18-22 weeks.  Good luck.
5yAsj29Vaa	That's ok... my son measured about 3 weeks ahead almost my entire pregnancy and he turned out perfect.  Big guy 9lbs 4oz but perfectly fine and healthy.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Question:    Let's say you're 25 years old. Do you think that all 25 year old females are the same height and weight? Or is there some average to which we're all compared?    Babies are the same. There's an average size to which a child is compared, but most children will be somewhat above or below the average. If they're too far above or below, the medical professional will do more looking. A couple of weeks either way is no big deal.|`|28fNd725aa	I think its prolly okay... but if you are that upset talk to the ob over your midwife....  Chances are you could be either a week farther along then you thought.... but either way as long as everything else check'd out ok... I wouldn't worry!! Congrats!!|`|uuHPneEcaa	I wouuldn't be worried. you baby is probably fine.I am sure|`|miPubuDYaa	The songram measurements are great tools howvever at your stage in pregnancy they could be mismeasured upto 8oz -+    The sonographer measure the baby abdomen with an oval and the computer puts out how big the baby should be. However what if he turned slightly or she made the oval just a little to big. Now your baby measures bigger than he should.    Also the measurement is going against the average. The average newborn weight is 7 pounds. Most babies are not average so they either measure smaller or bigger. If there was anything to be concerned about the doctor will tell you. But there really isnt anything wrong.|`|f9QqdNFZaa	no dont worry , i worked in OB for 3 years in the past and it is quit common that babies measure bigger than gestational age, I think my son did as well (been 6 years ago) and he was perfect ... no worries, they might have gotten your due date mixed up also, so that is something to think about too: )|`|CEuxMzaXaa	They say give or take two weeks. His measurements are only 2 weeks 2 days different. That may just mean he might come a little earlier than expected, which is a good thing, believe me. I'm 38wks1d and I'm praying my baby comes early. remember a 37 week baby is considered full term so as long as he doesn't come earlier than that you should both be fine. He could just be a big baby.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	In regards to the HE comment, it is common for anyone who doesn't know the sex of something to refer to it as a he so I don't think that means anything. As for the measuring big, I'm sure it's fine or she wouldn't have shrugged it off.
98WKYtfwaa	Why did they put you on extra strength tylenol?    If you look up all the ingredients online and see what effect they have on pregnant woman, don't look up the brand of tylenol, look up the individual ingredients. Yes your nutritionist is correct about taking 2 prenatals is overdosing, you only need a certain amount of each vitamin, and taking more can do more damage than good.     I was able to take a medication that wasn't allowed in pregnancy, but i was to take the lowest dose and only use it for 2-3 days at the most and don't use it if i don't feel like i need it. (I had a sinus infecton, was only to take the painkillers when it hurt at lowest dose).     Could you call up your doc and ask another doctor or ob available? Or like a number you can call i know in the UK we've got NHS24.    EDIT* Tylenol is safe, but i'm more than sure that extra strength isn't allowed. If it is though, which it could well be (i just remember reading that only one type of tylenol was allowed) then the side effects could just be there because you're pregnant, weird things happen when you're pregnant.|`|chTCMyQ5aa	You prenatal vitamins might be making you sick. Mine did. Try Flinstone vitamins, my doctor said i could take them instead cause the other ones made me so sick.    Good Luck|`|5d6ac5016d8e7904fd28943ad38bde0faa	Hey, first of all i would say go to another doctor/clinic because if you cannot rely on these ppl now that u obviously are worried than you need to go somewhere else...have u tried calling and asking for a nurse? and maybe at this time they are having lunch or something...    on another note, try taking your pre natal vitamins ONCE a day and before you go to bed, i never got morning sickness or anything like that...if that doesnt work i have a friend that said her doc told her to take vitamin B6 50mg 3x a day and she hasnt gotten sick since, and she's only 6 weeks along...and another girl took flinstones vitamins..    and i'm assuming u got extra strength tylenol for ur headaches...so i would read the label and dosage and follow the instructions very careful...and if the urgent care doctor (have u tried calling them?) knew that u were pregnant and prescribed u those tylenol pills than he knows they wont affect the baby...but u could still react diff than other moms to it...i had a bac infection and my doc gave me antibiotic and i barfed for 2 days, it obviously didnt agree with me...and u prob heard this 200x but everyone goes through a diff pregnancy..    but keep calling ur doc, and if u dont get through call another clinic or like primecare...email me if u have questions plz.|`|AA10450066	500mgm isn't really too much as regular strength is 325mgm. so go ahead and take that as directed, if your doctor told you to take the prenatal vitamin twice a day there must be a reason.When anyone tells you to take medication other than usual always ask for the reason why and if there are any side effects you should be aware of.Don't ever not ask a question just because someone is a doctor,it's your body and you need to know the facts.If your one of those people like me that remembers 2 or 3 things after leaving then write down things as you think of them and take the list with you.Believe me you'll walk away satisfied.Your nutritionist is just that a person that has studied nutrition, if they are with your doctor at urgent then thats 1 thing but to just come out and accuse a doctor of overdosing you is wrong.Unless they're privvy to your personal case they really can't say.The only 1 that can help you is the doctor,so you're going to have to make an appointment,and explain to your boss that this baby and your health are really important.Most people understand that things go wrong and would give you the time to go.The only other thing I can suggest is to tell them at the doctors office what the problem is,and see if he/she can get back to you when possible.|`|ROJans2Taa	tylenol is generally safe, it's codeine you need to be wary of, as for the pre natal I dont see why one  a day isnt enough, im in canada we have a 1-800 health line here that you can speak to a nurse, is there anything like that where you live? best luck|`|nAOlBmzDaa	WHY would they suggest you "o/d" on Prenatals? They should only be taken ONCE a day... I would get a new doctor...|`|i8Ch743Laa	Tylenol is fine....regular or 500 mg|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	PREnatals ONCE a day. if they make you sick try and take them before bed so you aren't sick all day. extra strength (500Mg) tylenol is OK. one every 4-6 hours.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	I would just stick with regular tylenol, until you hear from your doctor.  The side effects could be because 1. the medicine just isn't working, and 2. it might just be too hard on your stomach.    also, here's a site you might find helpful -- it's call safefetus.com  you can look up any type of medicine to see if it's safe during pregnancy.    Congratulations on your pregnancy!  Hope you feel better soon =)|`|afW58le8aa	I get sick when I take higher doses of tylenol.  I would try taking half a pill and see what that does.  As for your prenatals, I take them right before I go to bed with half a unisom and half a vitamin b6.  Always check with your doc before taking anything but my OB-GYN prescribed this for me so that I would be able to keep my vitamins down.  Chances are the meds are still a little to much for your preggo belly and the further along you get the easier it will be for you.  Good Luck!

Mj1qhzcIaa	FF says 18 DPO with high temps and you are pregnant! I know it is probably crazy with what it could be but test tomorrow and the thin faint lines should atleast increase in color.

Baby dust!|`|4AO2myzKaa	Yes, a very light second line....but definitely pregnant both times I had that!

2arZOZWgaa	If you don't feel the alcohol then your baby will not feel it either. It is true that if you are sober enough to drive then you are sober enough to breastfeed.    Its a popular misconception to think that pumping and dumping does any good other than peace of mind.      Pumping takes a lot of work, in my opinion, so it may take a while before you have enough supply built up.  I wouldn't plan on going out with your friends for the first month or so.|`|7gde2DRraa	Yes, alcohol affects your breastmilk the same way it affects your blood.  Once you are completely sober, it is safe to breastfeed.  Good luck and have fun and always remember to drink responsibly!!!|`|xK6wehG7aa	yes. If you're sober enough to drive, you're sober enough to nurse|`|3CVfUiiJaa	While every mother is entitled to have a relaxing night...why are you planning one before your baby even gets here?    As for your question...I don't know I think after 24 hours its ok.    You can thumbs down me all you want...my baby is more important to me then getting drunk.|`|JP2h62qiaa	You should just stay with that baby. Alcohol only stays in your breast milk for 3 hours. So you will be fine having A BEER OR TWO and then pumping and dumping. No hard alcohol. Don't get plastered. You are a mommy now. What if something happened to your baby? I still haven't done anything and my son is 14 months. That is just my style though. I changed my WHOLE life when I became pregnant.|`|AA11927140	Trust me, I completely understand your desire to go out and have some fun with your friends.  You've been sober for 10 months, minimally, and there is nothing wrong with socializing with your buddies!  (Note the info. about "pumping and dumping"... I found it very interesting!)      Here is what I found online at Babycenter:  "If you're going to enjoy an occasional alcoholic beverage or have more than one drink, wait at least two hours per drink before nursing your baby to give the alcohol a chance to dissipate. One drink is considered 4 ounces of wine, one beer, or one mixed drink. Alcohol isn't stored in breast milk, so "pumping and dumping" (using a breast pump to empty your breasts and then throwing out the collected milk) serves no purpose. And be sure to down a nonalcoholic drink for every cocktail you quaff, to ward off dehydration."    Hope this helps!|`|CsLyyRQeaa	no.  The alcohol will be in your milk for a couple days|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	You should be fine.  I would maybe pump when you get home and dump it.  By morning you'll be fine.  If you're worried, just supplement with formula till you feel comfortable breastfeeding again.  I'm sure you're going to get a lot of answers saying it's irresponsible and blah blah blah, just ignore it, go out and have a fun night out. You deserve it :)|`|yCwPxulYaa	Rule of thumb is.....if you are sobber enough to drive, you are sober enough to breastfeed.|`|UYU1kapPaa	No!  The alcohol will stay with you for a little while.  You need to pump enough for at least 24 hours.|`|u8upcF5jaa	I would give him formula and pump that milk and throw it away just in case there are any residue of alcohol in your system. But you should put more than he needs just to be safe and then throw away your next pump and then you should be good to give him the third pump.  Good luck|`|0d0dc9009af2de95764839dd48b543adaa	I found that when I expressed milk I could only express about 3 ounce per breast at a time, and after expressing because I was giving her the bottle (of expressed milk) rather than putting her to my breast they would become really engorged and painful by the time her next feed was due. Now of course everybody is different and I don't know how soon after having your baby you were planning on going out, but just bare in mind that it takes a good few weeks to establish a proper breastfeeding routine, if this is your first baby you can't fully comprehend what I'm saying to you right now, but believe me once you've had your baby and are breastfeeding him/her you will understand it's a full time job 24/7 for the first few weeks until you've both mastered the art. And you might not want to undo all that hard work by expressing a lot of milk by the sounds of what you are saying and throwing your body out of sync.    Wish you all the best, enjoy your baby! xxx    P.s I was told it takes the same amount of time for alcohol to leave your breast milk as it does your bloodstream. I think that's 1 unit per hour.|`|NpomCCjUaa	I've just had a baby, and although I haven't managed a night out without my baby yet, I intend to at some point in the future.    One of the baby books I use (Baby Love by Robin Barker) says that it can take several days to express enough for one feed, so recommends that you should plan ahead for your night out. If you try to pump all that is needed just before you go out, you may not be able to get enough, and you'll find it stressful.    From what I've read about the effects of alcohol (Your Baby by Simone Cave and Dr Caroline Fertleman) is that once you metabolise the alcohol, it is eliminated from your body and your milk, and isn't stored in the milk after that. I assume that means allowing 1 hour per unit of alcohol you've drunk.|`|SjX72fPyaa	When my daughter was about 2-3 weeks old, her dad and I went to a wedding out of town so we left her at my mums house for the night. I had asked her doctor about when I should continue nursing her if I had a few drinks and she told me as long as I was completely sober when I went to pick my daughter up the next day then I was ok to nurse. To be completely on the safe side I still decided to keep giving her pumped milk for 24 hours after my last drink and I used the "pump and dump" method for that period of time.|`|rOFteEdlaa	after you drink you will need to pump and throw it out for 24 hours so i would hope that your able to get enough breast milk to last minimum of 24 hours for the baby, other then that i would say don't drink if you don't have enough milk to last 24 hours or more, when you become a mom you give A lot if not all your life up until the baby is off the breast, i know my twins didn't go anywhere without me till they were 6 months old and i didn't drink till they were not around me and with my youngest (i couldn't breast feed) she was with her gramma for 2 hours when she was 3 months old so i could get some well needed alone time away from 3 kids.  and even now i don't really get away from my daughter except for when im working and shes at daycare|`|Blh37nu5aa	Best to check with a doctor or the lactation nurse at the hospital.  You could 'pump and dump' the next day providing there's enough to get you through the next day, but it's always best to ask...    And you need to write down the questions on a note pad, and take them with you to the hospital or doctors office.  My wife did this with our second child, because we were always forgetting to ask when we were in with our first child.  You think you'll remember, but it's really easy to get sidetracked.  And when the hormones are raging it's hard to concentrate.
45nSn7Rcaa	Give my kids rules...make them do chores, etc etc....I thought that while I was growing up, but when you grow up and mature you find out these are necesary and important things you have to do to be a good parent....most people think things like that and many of them don't ever get over it and their kids run around and conrol the parents and the household.|`|KHbqfLRUaa	Give my child a pacifier.  That lasted until about the sixth hour we were home from the hospital with a crying newborn!  Now he is almost two and I can't get the darn thing away from him!|`|ltfeYdr5aa	Give my child chocolate milk.|`|TTS9cvUmaa	Spying on them . LOL !!! I feel guilty but i spied on my neice on facebook and then grilled her for talking to that boy her other friend was calling a "paedophile". According to her that was a joke and the boy in reference was 15 like her. But it had freaked me out to read those words.     So yes i have spied when i should have not.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Laughed at my baby farting. It seems like everything is cute when he does it, even that.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Spank them.  I always swore up and down I would never do that....until I had kids and realized that they could tear up a crow bar if I gave them one! LOL    Kids, gotta love em!  LOL|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Told my kids the reason for something I told them to do was 'because I said so."|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	Letting them watch more TV than I did as a kid...|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Saying "Because I said so."      I'm ashamedly guilty of it!|`|NuvKPl3naa	spank, but sometimes they wont listen other wise. also having no patience. i was the most patient person you would ever meet, until the 4 kids came along. (i love them by the way) moms know what i mean
tWKZVDG2aa	I love Jude Alexander, that is a really lovely name.  I am not so keen on Naomi Allison.  My friend is called Naomi and so many people call her Ni-omi Ney-omi Nah-omi Ne-omi Naho-me etc.  She finds it very annoying and I don't really like the name Allison either.  I prefer the spelling Alison.  What about Alice or Alexa or Andrea or Alexandra?|`|nZjyIAVhaa	Yes they're just quite normal, regular names.     Nothing special, nothing bad.     xx|`|khXzNl6Iaa	i like the middle names but Jude & Naomi are soooo plain!|`|we0xPfYLaa	Awww I love those names!!!  Very different and very nice!|`|QzBgeyKeaa	Yes I do , both very cute and names that are good to grow up with.|`|l9auUv2laa	yes i like both but i dont like the name alexander...(:|`|N9Ewyo4Saa	yes! love them!|`|pnwR6iMkaa	Yes, very nice names!|`|R1cey1Evaa	Great! I really like the name Naomi! And Jude Alexander is cute too! :)|`|NWEJdpocaa	I love Jude Alexander and I love Naomi but I don't know if Allison sounds all that great with it.|`|i2V17yi4aa	i dont like the names "jude and naomi" the middle names are fine|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Sorry don't like Jude    Girl is very very lovely|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Jude Alexander is awesome.   LOVE Naomi, not so keen on Allison. But it sounds okay. :-)|`|Elxuvon8aa	not to fond of jude I knew a guy by that name he disliked it He was in the USA from England where it was more accepted he just did not like it here in high school.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I love Jude Alexander.  Not big on Naomi.  Maybe try Allison Naomi Hawthorne.  I like Allison Noelle myself.|`|JXXZIsBvaa	Jude Alexander is nice,   I don't like Naomi.|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Nice. I had a really good friend named Naomi, so it is a positive name to me.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	boys name is really nice  not to sure of naomi|`|IqNLR5BBaa	Yes
xRJQSNJeaa	Yes. It is totally normal and I hate to be telling you this. But most three years old have the whole attitufde thing going for them. There are stages that evey kid goes through from about the age of two to about the age of four sometimes until they get in to kindergarten. Because it's terrible two, terryifing threes and fearful fours. It's a proven fact as an Early Childhood educator that the children go through these times in spurts and there are good times and bad. There are ways you can make the behavior go away such as time-outs and no toys are TV have always worked. Anything that he could picking up on is at preschool or daycare he is seeing these behaviors and imitating at home also another thing to do is sit down and discuss with him that behavior is not acceptable and no good. Also you might want to speak to his daycare or preschool teachers about reinforcing these behaviors int the classroom and what not. But hold in there because this mini storm  will blow over. Good Luck I hope I helped :)|`|AA10153923	Everything starts under your own roof.  Make sure that this behavior is being reinforced at home too.  If at home he is disrespecting you, he will in public too.    Me and my brother in sister usually would act better with strangers in public rather than in our home. (although we had a lot of respect in the home) We did not want to embarrass ourselves, we knew mom and dad would punish us and embarrass us in front of others. Not to the point that it would be mental or emotional abuse, but they would say things that stood out to us. We never would want to be embarrass again.   Dont let him out of your sight, hold his had, do not give him freedom in public places, and if he wants it he must prove it. He know that he rolls his eyes, sticks his tongue out, crosses his arms, sighs" are not correct. Hes gonna need to learn the hard way, a lot of positive discipline.|`|5bfacd3c22e6c2a612d7643aa306d6a7aa	i have learned that if you take away the one toy that he plays with and will not let any one have or if you don't let him do something that he loves to do and tell him that he can't do the thing he loves to do or play with this one toy that is special to him until he starts acting right and not doing all of the bad things he does. but this attitude is common in most 3yr old's. If he goes to preschool mabey he is learning this action from kids at his preschool.|`|sr7XHvBKaa	YESSSSSSSSSSS! it is!|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Say nothing walk away and ignore it.|`|aWckGacbaa	you get down to their level, tell him he needs to behave and if not he is going to lose ( pick his favorite thing) for the day or a few depending..and make sure you do it. when he is good praise him a bunch but when he is bad you need to make it a miserable time for him when he gets home so he connects it together...the first rule is that mama needs to happy...kwim?|`|PvPPivLJaa	My 3 year old sticks her tongue out at me too, tells calls me "sneaky butt" which is something I assume she learned from daycare and all sorts of antics to prove her little independence.    A lot of times, I don't let it bother me. If she sticks her tongue out at me, i'll pinch her nose (not hard) and ask her who does she think she is? She smiles and eventually does what I ask her.     If she gets seriously out of hand to where she's just being a complete mess, I will definitely drop down to her level and let her know with my voice and eyes that it is not acceptable. She usually cries profusely afterward because i've given her ego a little knock down, but she eventually does what I ask and I give her a big hug and kiss and let her know I don't like to scold her, but she will mind me one way or the other.    She's getting how it goes a little more every day. It's going to take some time.|`|lmWqwpygaa	The long way around is to reason with him. This takes a lot of time and patience. If you have the time....then maybe thats better.  If you don't, then the spanking is the next best way. But it should be done at home first....then after the child "knows" what a real spanking is, maybe only the threat of one will make him behave in public. Sometimes you have to spank them in public. Real spankings work-period. Play spankings, and or spankings disconnected from the  misbehavior cause more problems.|`|krQiDGCHaa	If you're somewhere fun in public, like a playground or some other entertaining place for him, you get down on his level and say the following in a FIRM but non-yelling voice. "You listen to me (insert name here).  That is inappropriate and NOT okay.  If you (insert action here.. make a face/stick your tongue out/roll your eyes) at me again, we are leaving and going home immediately, and you will be taking a time out."  If he does it again, follow through with your actions.    If you're in public somewhere like running an errand: "That is inappropriate and NOT okay.  If you (insert action here) again, there is going to be punishment when you get home."  If he does it again, follow through.  For instance, take his favorite toy away when you get home, or take away his TV privledges.  Whatever you know will bother him the most, take that away.    He needs to learn to mind his parents, and attitude is SO not okay.
7gde2DRraa	I used the Holy S**t I NEED AN EPIDURAL NOW method!!!    lol|`|hmLzX9CJaa	I actually went on epidural. Since I went on 8 hours labor and that was midnight. I actually was so restless and my body was like shaking to death. So in order for me to rest a bit I went on epidural. When I woke up , I had my baby already beside me. I was really slept during the operation.  BTW, I was with a midwife in Maternity Hospital.|`|wURg3jBcaa	I was planning on a natural birth in the hospital- no drugs and a doula.    Everything changed when my daughter was breech and couldn't be turned- so it was a scheduled c-section- something I didn't want to have happen, but sometimes the choices are made for you.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I used  a midwife in a hospital. It was the perfect middle ground. I had planned a drug free water birth and things just didn't go as planned. My water broke and labor never started so I ended up induced. After 7hrs of induction and back labor I took the epidural.     I had the more natural approach of a midwife and the low intervention rate, my birth would have been a c-section with my obgyn I had been using before. I was still in a hospital which made me feel safer. I still had access to doctors if it was needed.    The only other way I would consider doing it is at home. I really beat myself up for taking the epidural and kind of wish it wouldn't have been an available option. The infection risk is much lower at home as well since you aren't with all of the icky hospital germs.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I had a hospital birth with a midwife, with pethidine, gas & air and the epidural as pain relief... lol.    Pros: I was at the hospital in case anything went wrong, I was able to have any type of pain relief I wanted (I wasn't wanting the epidural but the pain got too much!), the midwife was really nice & didn't end her shift until i'd had my daughter.    Cons: I wasn't allowed to eat during my labour cos of the epidural, I was so hungry... lol. On the ward after i'd had her it was noisy due to 7 other mummys and babies being on it too, it wasn't comfortable and I didn't enjoy it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I used the "I'm 35 and my water just broke at 36 weeks so the chances of me getting through this without a c-section are 1000 to one" method.    I don't think I want another kid, but I almost want to do it again so *some* aspect of it could be what I wanted.  Like, any aspect.|`|xK6wehG7aa	I gave birth at a hospital because I had pre-eclampsia.    Pros: I was in a hospital if anything went wrong, I was able to receive the care I needed for my rising blood pressure    cons: It was noisy and I couldn't relax at all, I kept being told that if things didn't hurry up that I would have to have a c-section|`|faPKwClPaa	I'm with the first poster -- I went with the 'How fast can the anethesiologist get in here?' birthing method.    I eneded up as a c-section due to no progress being made.  I had an inkling I'd have a c-section, but you just never know what's going to happen...|`|ggETPqedaa	I was going to do a water birth, though it ended up to be a c-section when no progress was being made. Though the baby wasn't in any distress.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Hospital birth with OB.  I'd gone through Lamaze classes and hoped to avoid meds, but a very slowmoving, long labor left me too tired to continue, so I opted for an epidural after about 18 hours or labor.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Hospital, with midwife.  Induction, entonox and then epidural (+ entonox at same time, epidural didn't really work).    Next time I want home waterbirth with midwife in attendance.    Pros: It was fast, but I didn't like the hospital stay afterwards  Cons: Induction meant hard, fast contractions, epidural didn't work.  couldn't move about, so couldn't try and take pain away that way.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Baby  1 was an emergency C-section after 30 hours of labor.    Baby  2 was a VBAC    Baby  3 was a VBAC    C-section is a good alternative to quickly remove mother and baby from a dangerous situation; however, the VBAC was so much better.  I recovered much more quickly and was more aware and involved in the whole process.|`|Is4WEXUJaa	I was in the hospital with my midwife as I was scheduled for induction. I was allowed time in their spa tub too, not quite a water birth but it was relaxing. :)     Pros: was there if something went wrong or wanted an epidural (which I did but by the time I wanted one it was too late). I also had that spa tub lol    Cons: It was noisy and busy with all the other laboring moms that night.. they were packed!|`|aCLQXdB0aa	I had no choice at all,i mean don't get me wrong i had a choice and a plan till we got a BIG snow storm and we were stuck in the house!!!!  So i had a normal vaginal painful birth at home thank god my midwife was there.i had a water birth till i kept putting my legs together and kept getting yelled at so i had to squat on the floor but that didn't work for me so i used the hands and knees position and my midwife used the bathroom so my mom delivered the baby and she didn't want to pull her out so i had to push everything out...OUCH|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I chose to give birth in a hospital because I liked the idea of knowing that in the even of an emergency I was already where I needed to be.  My son wound up getting stuck and we ended up with an emergency situation.  Luckily they got him out in time using forceps.  It was very comforting knowing he was in a hospital where they could help him.  My second was born at the hospital as well.  She wound up getting stuck and I was given an emergency c-section to avoid the complications my son had.  In all honesty every woman is different and you don't know what may happen.  I am 5'10" with a large bone structure but my pelvis is not designed for a vaginal birth.  Who would have thought someone of my size would have this problem.  I always think of the worst case scenario.  I have heard women say that "I only live 10 minutes away from the hospital so we will be fine in an emergency".  When it comes to child birth 10 minutes can mean the difference between life and death.|`|nBlSS6HUaa	I had my daughter in a hospital in Ohio. I had a natural vaginal childbirth! No meds once so ever! As for the midwife...didn't have one... why would I or anyone else choose someone to help me through my labor that isn't a DR? Weird to me! Anyway...I loved my labor and delivery! Can't say anything bad about any of it!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I gave birth naturally in a hospital.  No drugs, no IV but I did let them monitor the baby here and there.  I had planned on a water birth but my labor was too fast.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I had to be induced so I gave birth in the hospital.   And I tried doing it without the epidural but the contractions had me crying they hurt so bad so about an hour after active labour started I had them give me the epidural lol.   Which I'm very glad for because she had turned the wrong way and I couldn't push her out so they had to pull out the good ol' forceps. However they kinda killed the effects of the epidural so that was a major downside for me.  The pros are they caught on to the fact that my pushes weren't actually doing anything so they were able to fix that. And I was able to get the epidural lol  The cons are you don't really get any privacy at all in the hospital. Nurses are always popping in and checking on you. While I was in the hospital the nurses kept waking me up to ask me questions!

KolPO87Raa	She needs to see a child psychologist. The behavior you describe is consistent with a child that has been molested. Your niece needs help, it may be an ongoing problem. Good luck|`|hY0cb2xRaa	Take her to counseling. Her past is a problem and she needs to understand that and be normal like other kids..|`|UUpsa35Daa	Being overly touchy feely and sexual at this young of age is a sign of sexual abuse. You said that she was touched when she was younger...that's probably the cause of it (but not ruling out something else that was never discovered).    Right now, have all of her visits with kids supervised just in case. I would suggest to her parents that she get some counseling, going to talk to a psychologist, to talk about what's going on in her head. She could possibly grow out of it, but even if she does...it'll get worse before it gets better and then she and/or others could possibly get in some trouble.    Getting her to talk about it and deal with all of the issues battling in her head right now is what should be done.|`|WHmTmAb1aa	When I was 6 I was always playing kissing games with girls.

rhPCJfeuaa	I would take her to the doctor that put the tubes in her ears.  My daughter's ear drum was perforated when she was two.  I believe her hearing in that ear has remained a bit sensitive.  They even say that the drum can remain a bit weakened and may pop again under the right circumstances.  I had to put plugs in her ears whenever she went in the pool or in a sprinkler for 2 summers after that.    Either way, without a medical degree and the right instruments, our speculation isn't going to ease your mind or help your daughter with ehr sensitivity.  Seek a medical opinion, if for nothing else than to possibly make her more comfortable.|`|zhk8o514aa	An superhearo with super sonic hearing! Whooooosh!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Of course you should get it checked.|`|Gem96NQyaa	If typical household noises, like the vacuum or loud speech, are causing her physical pain, then yes, you should certainly get it checked.  That's not in any way normal.

E6T9DPT9aa	No. Especially as you cannot spell "with". Disgraceful to be honest.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|eEK3m1aXaa	No, I don't believe it is ok, by any means.  First, the 22yr old and the 14-15 yr. old are in completely different stages in life.  Second, the 22 yr. old will most likely get in some kind of legal trouble, especially if the parents of the 14-15 yr. old finds out and isn't accepting of the relationship.    I'd say, forget about the whole thing!      ~_~|`|swbS13Xmaa	No.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	If you're really desperate and want to go to jail sure why not.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Only when pigs fly, and still then, no.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	no not really.|`|69DjSUVAaa	No 14-15 year old is far too young for you.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	only if your a paedophile|`|jPlUycx0aa	EEWWWWWW! a 22 year old shouldnt want to go out with a 14/15 year old. Thats Gross. He/She is a pedophile|`|PoHpSqwwaa	Definitely not. The guy's a pedo...|`|QSodlfMraa	nope dude thats jail bate.|`|1l04qpOKaa	No way--that could be jail time|`|4kX61Y97aa	ideally not the best thing to do because as a mature adult to go out with a teen if you split up they could say you had sexual relations when they were under 16 =/ personnaly i do think its wrong always try and date someone your  own then you cant get accused|`|ONAgORxhaa	no,sorry but its not.the difference in maturity between a 22 yr old and 14 yr old is immense-however grownup the 14/15 year old seems.Its not only illegal but morally wrong.the 22 yr old would be taking advantage.however when the 15 yr old is 22 he/she can make up there mind to date an older man/woman with out crossing the boundries of good taste and common sense!|`|N24wkFROaa	er no you pervert    please do not touch him/her or that will be statutory rape and you will go on the sex offenders register and go to jail, but since your a paedophile i don't give a f**k about you. SICKO.|`|M7lOK6DWaa	No. The older person could serve jail time. Especially if they had sexual relations. That other person (22) would be considered a pedophile.|`|zSABr7praa	Not only is not ok, but if the relationship becomes physical, it's illegal.|`|LBHQkBnkaa	Only if you are tired of fresh air and can't wait to meet your fellow nonces in prison.|`|O8XjkCjxaa	Definitely not! A guy that age only wants one thing and he's obviously not a nice guy if he can't get it off people his own age.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	no no no no no no no|`|GGH0HVdvaa	No! its wrong|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	NO!!!    You will eventually be pressured to have sex with the guy!!    When that happens, he will be committing Statutory Rape!!|`|ozATw7s0aa	what would a 22 year old want with a 14 year old?    other than sex|`|lcxyOS7uaa	Not unless the 22 year old wants Jail time.|`|ZU5y3OVVaa	Not really. The 22 year old is either immature or manipulative. Either one spells trouble. Do you want a boy / girlfriend or a) someone who is a baby in an adults body - b) a control freak who wants to use you in some way.     As you get older the age difference isn't so important as you have both had time to mature. Lots of young people are flattered by attention from older people but they should be building relationships with people their own ages.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	id have to say no to that. id only say yes if the person was 18|`|f3LrMhqWaa	no first legally, if you engage in any type of sexual activities you could be charged with statutory rape!also, mentally the 14-15 year old will not be as mentally mature as you. socially, it will be seen as wrong as well,go find someone your own age!|`|QGP930C6aa	NO... my mate did that and he got 8 months (and they didnt sleep together)|`|Bgzq0K1Iaa	No, it's not.|`|YdbpwkFEaa	no thats so rong im 15 and think all the 22 years old mor fit than the 15 years but dont go it|`|09xCfB9Faa	Dont listen to other people if the case it was a 23yr old with a 30 year old people would accept it, ok so it doesnt look good, but it depends what the 22year old wants from a 15yr old. jus dont let it get too serious if a 22yr old was havin sex wiv a 14/15 yr old they are commitin a crime! But dont listen to other people some 22yr olds look 17 im sure you know what is right n if u thought it was u wudnt on wrote the question.gd luck x|`|u5F22mEbaa	absolutely not...|`|b9e7mvusaa	no|`|C7jrdNb3aa	NO!  Of course it isn't. The 22 year old should date someone their own age.. same with the 14/15 year old.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	No|`|SnoKfIKOaa	No. It is illegal for sex to happen then for a start, and also that is a HUGE age difference at that age. It is like child abuse, well not LIKE it, it is it!!|`|EJN79jlTaa	HELLL NAW THTS JAIL BAIT|`|cBC20tjaaa	no|`|VYMOwgc3aa	Oh God no.    Not at all.    |`|tX6kUdmDaa	no thats well pervy.

And that 22 year old is going to really hear it from the 14/15 year olds parents.|`|9poYqbnjaa	na i don't think it would work and the 22 will go in jail.|`|Ft78AcWjaa	Some 14/15 year old girls look older than they are and can be very attractive.    However technically it is illegal if the law find out so my advice is to stay away from any jailbait.    Look for those who are 16+|`|3HWV0AkKaa	NO!!! he or she is not even old enough to take care of himself or herself let alone be in a commited relationship. not even a stupid casual relationship. plus its illegal!   p.s. especially you, you dont even know how to spell with!!|`|L1g6ZnkXaa	no..|`|2JZ9vzMMaa	no. it's illegal. it's a form of rape. and it's just plain creepy. wait a few years if it's a love match.|`|YcCquky4aa	LEARN THE SPELL    nope it aint   perv|`|aHYengrwaa	no especially as the 14-15 year old isnt legal if the law finds out he will be prosecuted as peodophilia and child abuse sexual grooming and so on|`|FUYB889Caa	NO!!!|`|5wt0En1Zaa	Yes...and no..  If you really love him and he loves you to it's ok.  It isn't really ideal though  This is because most big age gaps don't work.  You're in different stages of life.  The best thing to do is be friends with this person or maybe wait when your older then it wont be so bad.  Are you going ou with him/her now?|`|HoU7Vjngaa	no this yukky blech|`|tZeNU4G1aa	not in america at least.....|`|9c664e07f8c2007897e3697258c8ca68aa	no it is not ok!|`|SAVkfNs4aa	no no no, your why im a virgin

AjFA8qIxaa	Count 28 days from your last period. If it has been more then 30 days ( give it two days cuz even with the pill most ppl start a couple days after the 28 days)  then you're late.   If you think you can take a test then .  There are also early pregnancy tests - they can tell you from the first day of your pregnancy. But beware they might give you a false negative, since your pregnancy hormons might not be enough yet to show. There are also tests that can tell you exactly how many days you have already been pregnant ( cool, huh..lol)  Try clear blue.|`|G01hkXhPaa	One question to you, what is depo? Anyway, about the possibility of pregnancy, here are a few symptoms you might want to look out for while trying to remember the last day you had sex, the day you started your recent period, when it ended and any physical changes to your body. After this, I also suggest talking to a doctor as well:      Signs of pregnancy include:      Absence of menstruation (Doesn't always mean you're pregnant. Could be something wrong with your utereus, among other things.)  Morning sickness (nausea and/or vomiting any time of day) (I get this sometimes when I'm on my period. -_-)  Frequent urination   Tender, swollen breasts   Darkening of the areola (area around the nipple) and raised glands around the nipple   Blue and pink lines under breasts and on abdomen   Food cravings (Girls get cravings during their periods, too.)    If I remember correctly, the first signs of pregnancy are possibly two to three weeks after conceiving. However, I heard some women simply don't get the typical signs at all and I have a friend who didn't get the majority of those signs even when she was at least 6 months pregnant. Some of these signs can also be related to another health issue. Anyway, the best way to know is to check with a doctor.    There is more to it, but if you want to find out more, check out my source link.
YwaZMnnGaa	no but it feeds me faster.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	that's not how it works, silly!    it's like that saying about the peenish....it's not the size that matters...|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Every woman has a different milk storage capacity regardless of breast size.  Breast size is dependent on fatty tissue, not milk sinus number/size.|`|sv4guUQNaa	For any one over the age of 13, the term is breast.  And the answer is no.|`|lXE75yQjaa	WOWSA...I am sensing some serious boob hostility here, Judass. Being a certified boob expert (I have two, ya know)..I would have to say no. Size has nothing to do with it..it's how you use it. Hope that helps.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/milkpr...  Storage capacity: Another factor that affects milk production and breastfeeding management is moms milk storage capacity. Storage capacity is the amount of milk that the breast can store between feedings. This can vary widely from mom to mom and also between breasts for the same mom. Storage capacity is not determined by breast size, although breast size can certainly limit the amount of milk that can be stored. Moms with large or small storage capacities can produce plenty of milk for baby. A mother with a larger milk storage capacity may be able to go longer between feedings without impacting milk supply and baby's growth. A mother with a smaller storage capacity, however, will need to nurse baby more often to satisfy babys appetite and maintain milk supply since her breasts will become full (slowing production) more quickly.  ! Think of storage capacity as a cup - you can easily drink a large amount of water throughout the day using any size of cup - small, medium or large - but if you use a smaller cup it will be refilled more often.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I'm 27, have two kids and have breastfed for a combined total of 22 months and I say BOOBS.     The answer to your question is no. If you doubt that then make friends with google because I am more qualified to answer than you dear:)|`|e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	No, what a large breasted woman has more of is fat tissue - and that has nothing to do with milk production, I am afraid. If you are an "AAA cup" your breasts will grow to a B when full. If you are B to begin with they will grow to a D when full. For the "almost flat", that is 20 times growth, and for the other one it is only double - but the difference from the "idle state" is actually the same ;o) And that's the milk.    Something like that...|`|kzYHnrLSaa	no|`|AA12127418	no|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Boob size does not matter when feeding babies.|`|dI1umvklaa	Well I couldn't breast feed. Every time I tried I almost suffocated my babbies.    *cries*|`|gx4s68s8aa	No- size doesn't matter.  Actually it is a little harder to breast feed if you have really big boobs.  Not because of milk or anything, but because when your baby is an infant it can just be a bit difficult latching them on and dealing with your big breast size.  But breast size (small or large) has nothing to do with supply etc.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u r supposed to be 13 i think; but anyway, size of the breast isnt supposed to interfere with milk production|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	nope the size of the breast has nothing to do with how quickly the make milk- it would be a woman with smaller breass or a smaller breasted woman. i had d's and nursed fine my sister has As and nursed fine|`|snUDfcfgaa	I have no information for you, as my C cups have never fed babbies... at least not the infant type.  However, I do think this is a very good question.  A star for you!
GGH0HVdvaa	He sounds really mean, you don't need to waste your time with someone like that. You may feel like you "love" him, but it sounds more like he has a hold on you, and someone who really loves you back wouldn't make you feel this way.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Tell him the truth, even if it hurts him!  Why?  He hurts you all the time and you ignore it in the name of love.  Wow, that's some powerful emotion.  It's really going to be something when you marry the guy.  He'll walk all over you and you'll just love every step.  Wake up Girl.  Be the person you're meant to be.  Not someone's door matt.|`|avVdKiWKaa	I'm trying to understand why you would "love" such a self-centered prick.  I guess the sex must be good.  If so, use him and then lose him.  Quid pro quo.  Find a new bf who is capable of returning love.   They're out there.  You just got to find them.|`|E3yOmel9aa	You are unhappy with him, your personalities do not match and you feel like you can not discuss how you feel with him. It should be easy to decide what to do.|`|LP7ox8cKaa	are u gonna dump him jst coz sm ppl over here said so..?  ppl who maks use of phrase like "there r other fish in the see" & all are morons.    abt ur bf...sm guys r jst not comfortable wit wat they feel.  they think showing feelings is not a guy thing.  Jst tel him abt wateva u wrote abv in a way which will not hurt his pride.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Sounds like he's depressed and wants to bring the whole world down with him. Try talking to hm and tell him if he doesn't straighten up that you are leaving! And it might take a few days or weeks of being gone for him to realize that what he had with you was special and then he'll some crawling back begging you to forgive him. Trust me! Guys are dogs like that sometimes!|`|YHrATVTEaa	first of all your boyfriend is supposed to help you when you're upset not be the cause of it and if he's upsetting you to the point where you cry and are depressed you need to tell him as soon as possible and even though you're 'in love' with him you probably not planning to marry him so its got to end one day and you can do so much better !! it might be hard but you'll get over it and maybe he'll even say he'll change and you'll be aright or you can find someone else x|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Sounds like you need to ditch him. He doesn't sound like he is worth any effort.|`|iwYu32N2aa	If he makes you feel like that why are you even with him? There are plenty of fish in the sea that will be a better suit for you.|`|2vH6VktWaa	Awww!! Don't get upset! You should tell him how you feel!!|`|mimykKnhaa	hun, guys like that never change. it will only get worse, believe me i dated one. you may love him, or you may love the idea of him. you  need to break it off, and believe me, when you get yourself a real man, you will realize you never loved him in the first place. you deserve better.|`|0Z4tqTIMaa	can i just say that if you trust your significant other then you shouldn't be jealous... thats what my gf says, and it makes sense.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	You don't sound pathetic, he does. He sounds like a real looser.     Tell him outright what you think of his infantile behaviour and say that if he doesn't cut it out you will leave...if he keeps bringing it up say "that's exactly what I mean when I say you are juvenile." If he STILL doesn't quit it then I think it's time to move on, tough as it will be there is somebody better than him out there for you.    You sound like a good person and also pretty mature, he sounds like a spoilt little boy. And I'm sorry to be the one to say this but he also sounds like he has it in him to be a future "wife beater." I've studied men like that in college (and been with a few myself) and I pride myself on my ability to pick a manipulator and abuser out of a crowd.    Good luck and I really hope you can find the strength to leave him and get a guy who knows how to treat you. xxx|`|x3NIn6rSaa	If he's causing you pain.  Break up with him.  Time heals everything.  It sounds llike your relationship is sinking you down  Not raising you up.    Hang in there love (:|`|7rEMTohxaa	you should tell him if it is something that hurts and upsets you, make sure he knows how much it hurts.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	yes you should|`|OfGSF2vmaa	Tell him how you feel.    If he can not comprehend or respect your feelings    and he is hurting you then I would not be with him.|`|GNgp759Yaa	yes tell him, if hes doesnt listen then i dont think there is any point in you carrying on the relationship|`|GbLmBcIoaa	Of course you should tell him.    Remember this common truth about dealing with men, and your life among them will go much easier:  Hints do NOT work!|`|Cl4AfJPcaa	you need to tell him and if he acts like a jerk over it get out of the relationship. My ex was like that and he ended up beating me. DOnt let it keep goin on|`|hdzXwdPjaa	He sounds like a eal jerk...idk how you can go on loving him...but that's you.  Anyways, you have to tell him EVERYTHING, even the fact that if you let him know how you feel, then he might start rubbing it in. Then, if he doesn't listen, that's when you know it's just not gonna work out. But if you truely do love him, there must be a reason right? So if the reason is that he loves you deep inside, then he'll understand, and probably try to change. Hope this helps, feel better [=.|`|TDoLKtlVaa	Yes tell him the truth! You'll never know what he'll say until you've asked him. You don't have to ask him to change, he might just need to be more considerate.. he also might not know that you're sensitive or hurt by him.. If he doesn't want to cooperate and he just keeps hurting you, you can't stay with him! You wouldn't be happy... you should give him an ultimatum and tell him to apologize or think before he speaks. This isn't fair to you, and you have to let him know that. Good luck.|`|hZWup7xXaa	you should try to be as honest as you can with him. i know its kind of hard but you should never feel this way with the one you love. i don't know what else to say but i hope i've helped and good luck hun. :)|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	You should tell him and you should dump him, because you love him doesn't mean you have to put up with a situation like the one you are in. If you are in a relationship like that it's better for you to get out of it now, if you're scared of your boyfriend and he doesn't care about what you have to say then why would you want to stay with him? Love is blind and can lead you to do dumb things, so use your head and figure out what is best for you, I'm sure that if you leave this guy you would be able to find another boyfriend in due time.|`|QBNRbODBaa	DUMP HIM!!!    He's a jackhole and you deserve better. Boyfriends, or anyone else you consider a friend, shouldn't scare you or make you feel bad. That isn't stubbornness, by the way. It's called being an insensitive jerk.    -->You do not sound pathetic.|`|bjuaDTahaa	I've been in the same position as you so i know how much it hurts... he clearly likes being in control and likes that he can be nasty and get away with it so to speak...talk to him but let him know ur not a push over...good luck x|`|5ss2Ok9saa	Well I am having like the same type of ploblems with my boyfriend. We have been going out for 6 months and the first like month we started dating he was perfect but then it all changed.But I think you should just sit him down and talk to him about how you feel. And really when you think about it is it really worth the trouble? I love my boyfriend and he says he does but how he acts towards me I sometimes think he doesn't..The truth does hurt sometimes but you are going to have to tell him sometime just before he hurts you and if you need anymore help email me or even text me (770)841-6082|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Yeap tell him :]|`|R5ILa4Imaa	If you read this letter if it was posted by some one else what would you think? Would you not be saying that the boyfriend is a jerk and that the girl should ditch him. Why do you undervalue yourself to put up with that kind of treatment from him. He is an evil control freak with no respect for you. Please can you imagine the rest of your life with him being treated like that. Sorry he doesn't love you so please be strong and move on with out him.|`|8PRMu5nHaa	Obviously you are unhappy. Dump him.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	Ok if you're scared of him and you are depressed that maybe you should think of how much better off you would be alone. I don't understant why women get so caught up on guy'a that obviously don't care or at least act like they don't. You would feel so much more free and alive without this guy. Sure it will be tough for the first few weeks but it eill eventually feel so much better. You will look back and ask yourself why did I waste so much of my time and effort and hunny time is money.|`|jToi0zjJaa	With every relationship COMMUNICATION IS KEY! If you can't communicate, there IS NO relationship. If you can't talk to him and honestly tell him how you feel, he is not the man for you. Cut your losses now. I know you love him and it will hurt, but you WILL heal and find yourself a man who DESERVES you and will treat you right.     Try counseling if you are determined to stay but a relationship while it has its ups and downs, is not supposed to STAY down...    Think REEEEEALLY hard about this, hun...
R4dSJbtQaa	It could be your egg trying to implant.  I understand how you don't want to get your hopes up.    Hope this is it for you and I'm sending your lots of sticky babydust.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	sonds like "middleschmertz" or ovulation pain... its too soon to be implantation, i think? good luck!|`|75l2smfCaa	If it were me I would assume that I was ovulating then. Good luck tho!!! Baby dust!
gGW7K9U5aa	Well, its worth a try to see how he does. Basically, just keep introducing the potty to him. Since hes so young I would buy a toddler toilet. After a bottle or sippy cup, wait about 15 minutes and just have him sit on there until he goes. He will definitely let you know if hes ready or not. I was completely potty trained at 15 months old as well, but I had 5 brothers and 2 sisters. My older brother who was 2 1/2 at the time wasnt even potty trained yet when I was.  Give it a try and see what happens.|`|vue9NOhYaa	When?  Probably in about 18 months to 2 years. Nothing you write here suggests that he's ready for potty training, and given his age, he almost certainly ISN'T ready.  (The sort of 'potty training' that works at 9 months is basically mother training-- you put the child on the pot every half hour around the clock, or everytime he grunts or makes a face that indicates he's about to have a bowel movement.  This may save a few diapers [which may be valuable in societies where laundry is difficult], but doesn't teach the child anything.  Few children have the physical ability to control their own bowels/bladder much before 2 years, and most kids train between 2 1/2 and 4 years.    How?  Wait until he's actively interested, and then try whichever method works.  Some kids do best with 'naked training' (let them run around bare with a potty nearby). Others just need a few tries sitting on the potty and they've got it.|`|44OH7Si6aa	It is very difficult to potty train a child that cannot communicate that they need to go potty. You can take him to the potty frequently and hope for the best, but he can't fully train untill he can communicate his needs to you easily. Typically 18months is a good age to begin, but some aren't ready untill they are closer to age 3    Here are some signs you can look for to tell if he is ready (from babycenter.com):  -Is coordinated enough to walk, and even run, steadily  -Urinates a fair amount at one time  -Has regular, well-formed bowel movements at relatively predictable times  -Has "dry" periods of at least three or four hours, which shows that his bladder muscles are developed enough to hold urine.  -Can sit down quietly in one position for two to five minutes.  -Can pull his pants up and down  -Dislikes the feeling of wearing a wet or dirty diaper.  -Shows interest in others' bathroom habits (wants to watch you go to the bathroom or wear underwear.  -Gives a physical or verbal sign when he's having a bowel movement such as grunting, squatting, or telling you.  -Demonstrates a desire for independence  -Takes pride in his accomplishments  -Isn't resistant to learning to use the toilet.  -Is in a generally cooperative stage, not a negative or contrary one.  -Can follow simple instructions, such as "go get the toy."  -Understands the value of putting things where they belong  -Has words for urine and stool.  -Understands the physical signals that mean he has to go and can tell you before it happens or even hold it until he has time to get to the potty.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Whenever he is ready.  Boys take a little longer than girls, so don't rush him if he is not ready.|`|047IPSovaa	Let him potty train himself when he's ready.    'Few kids in kindergarten have not been potty trained|`|ivg0lRUraa	Its hard to say since all children are different, and it's not something you can rush on them without screwing em up down the line. You can just try it for a little while and see how he does. My son is 2 and is just now getting it down. Its not something you want to rush|`|rOFteEdlaa	i would say buy the potty, the training pants and if he knows what the potty is for and to pull his pants up and down well then he might be ready if not give it time not all kids are potty trained at the same time, i know i was 12 month when i was, my sisters were closer to 2 years old my brother was almost 3 and my niece was 9 months and our mom made it worse by pushing us to use the potty so we ended up not wanting to use it(my brother was the one who trained me he is 14 years older then me so i trained young since he was my only caregiver and he was persistent on showing me that big girls pee on the potty ETC) i refuse to push my kids to use the potty if they don't want to but my older girls were trained at 2 years old and my youngest is being trained right now|`|1dueLOdvaa	Um 11 months is a little on the young side for potty training.     They usually let you know when their ready.    They will start to become more interested in the potty and they will not want to be in their wet or soiled diapers.    Because he can walk and say ma ma and da da does not mean hes ready for the potty.|`|AA12127418	i think 11 months old is too young my sons doctor told me notx to start till he turns two|`|VVAvKCIVaa	If he seems like he is ready then I don't see why not but don't get to upset if he dose good and then goes back to not doing it anymore.    The best way I found it not only fun for my son but also easy for the both of us was to take a cheerio put it in the water and let him see if he can get it. I know it sounds crazy but it does work. Not only was that fun to my son but it also helped him learn to keep it inside the toilet. But do try to make it fun for him.|`|sbKWMMv9aa	PUT HIS FACE IN IT.  Oh wait, did you say "son"?    nevermind|`|CoSdW7xQaa	oh geez, I thought you really meant 11 year old!  Well personally, I think 11 months old is a little too young to start potty training  but every baby is different so if you think you and your baby are ready then go ahead!    Best of luck!|`|4ksa4lhWaa	You can start now there's nothing wrong with giving it a try BUT don't exect to much at first till he's a little older.      Most boys around 14- 18 months when they get it down. And I'v known friends with boys who were 2+ before they would do it.      Good Luck|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	sounds like you were a potty genius! when he wakes up dry in the morning and shows an intrest in pottying he is probably ready but if you get a potty chair now and he wants to use it great! my older son did all those same things and still didnt train until 2 1/2. usually i would say it is easiest around that age but you just never know-maybe you will get lucky!|`|SNllynBiaa	11 months is a little early but you can start talking to him about it. Maybe when he is about 18-20 months you will have a little better luck. When he does go make a big deal about it and reward him for going in the potty. Buy a potty book and read it to him.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Can he walk?  I don't think you can really potty train a kid until they're accomplished walkers.
7HzfgRmwaa	oh my!! What are you waiting for?!?! I think about 28 weeks I had everything but the carseat and I got that early Jan!! I'm ready to go and ready to start washing things this week!! I'm 36 weeks on Wed and ready to also start praying this little boy comes VERY SOON!!!    Good Luck to you!    **Oh! And i started actively shopping when I was around 17 weeks!|`|b3CwObBdaa	36 weeks and i have a big pile of  'stuff' and that's about it.  Eventually I will go through it.  Just not something that interests me right now.  I bought all the stuff, just have to clean it all and put it away.|`|gx4s68s8aa	No- I am 31 weeks.  We have lots of stuff left over from when our first child was born (she is 2 and a half) but there are some things that we need new, or things that we want this time around.  And we have things in storage that at my parents house that we need to get back and see if it is still in good condition.   I just started going through the process of looking at my daughter's old clothes and seeing which ones I want for the new baby girl.    The biggest thing we haven't done is pick out a name.  That is stressing me out big time.  My husband doesn't seem to be a rush about it.  And every name I come up with he doesn't like, so I am at a loss.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I'm 37.5 weeks and we have everything we need at this point. It's not like we've been sitting on it for months though. We did a big shopping blitz about two weeks ago to pick up everything that hadn't been given to us.    All that's left to do is mount some shelves on the wall in the nursery and get the second car seat base installed.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I am just 11 weeks along, haven't bought anything major yet. Just clothes and have looked at breast pumps and baby furnature. Not planning on buying anything major until after we know the sex of the baby. I am the type of person who is ready days/weeks/months in advance.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	WHY dont you like to have anything ready? because you like scrambling around with a brand new baby???? weird! oh well....|`|euUZZcM3aa	I'm 22weeks, and I still haven't really shopped for my baby girl. We're saving money up so after the babyshower we can get anything we need that we didn't get at the shower. We've bought some bibs and shoes, and friends of ours plan to give us stuff already, but aren't near having everything we need. I'm so anxious though!! Congrats to all of you pregnant women!!! :]|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	im 32 1/2 weeks with twins. i'm expected to deliver anytime between now and a couple of weeks. i have most everything ready for my little ones, except for some little stuff.|`|miPubuDYaa	I have nothing ready (except for a bassinette in the living room) for two reasons and I'm 26 weeks pregnant. 1) My shower isn't for another 8 weeks and  2)  My family tradidion is to wait until the baby is born and then family memebers do everything for you.    I'm not happy with the second reason at all, but my family is superstisious. Thier reasoning is what if god forbide something happens to the baby.     I'm going along with it because I'm having a c-section and know i'll be in the hospital for at least 4 days. enough time for them to prepare.|`|t6OGh0Edaa	Hi, I am about 32-33 weeks along and I still don't have everything yet.  I have 3 showers coming up since this is my first baby and so I am waiting until after that too start buying the other things I will need.  I have started stocking up on diapers a long while ago and love to buy things on sale ahead - like clothes and stuff to take care of baby.  It is so exciting but I have just tried to practice restraint - have to wait and see what all comes from the showers!  So, in short no I don't have everything!! Good luck! :)|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I'm 28 weeks and don't have anything ready. I am hoping to hear from a new apartment by the end of the week and if we get that I can finally start to try and figure things out. This is my third child but I still don't have anything because we thought we were done and got rid of EVERYTHING. My mother in law is going to throw me another baby shower but she scheduled it for April 2nd (my due date is April 23rd) so I think I'll have to wait till the last minute to find out what I am going to need to but myself.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Nothing. I'm 23 weeks today. I am at a high risk of early labor due to a heart-shaped womb, and I'm too afraid to start shopping now. I'm going to wait until I'm 28 weeks along and the baby would most likely live if born. Call me superstitious!    On the other hand, I have been cleaning and organizing and putting up shelves. Just nothing specifically for baby.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I am 28 weeks and I have everything except the carseat and I'm telling everybody that I dont have one so I can get more than one for all of our cars and the babysitters car! :)    It was actually fun getting stuff together for my daighter, but people think I am overdoing it, but I am only having ONE child so I'm having fun!|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I'm 34 weeks and 4 days pregnant today. Our 1st child just turned a year old on Wednesday so we basically already have everything. There are just a few more things I need before the new baby arrives:    -Dreft detergent  -New baby thermometer (the one we had is no longer working)  -Newborn and size one diapers  -baby wipes  -new bottles just in case I have to pump  -aveeno diaper rash cream (just in case)  -portable crib (our older son's crib converts to a toddler bed)  -portable crib mattress  -water proof mattress  -storage baskets  -baby tylenol and gas drops  -maxi pads for me  -Night light  -Sling  -Another carseat (for our older child)  -high chair for our older child (he was using a booster seat which will be for the new baby)  -bath cady  -Nursing pads  -More baby washcloths  -Umbrella or double stroller  -More baby music    We already have tons of clothes for the first year, caps, mittens, bibs, burp cloths, socks, onesies, towels, toys, pack n play, swing, boppy pillow, bouncy seat, walker, breast pump, etc. I'll be 35 weeks on Monday and that's when I'll be washing clothes and packing my hospital bag...|`|tRNwh2yxaa	I am 33 weeks, and pretty much everything is ready.  I just know that once you hit that 8 month mark, you may not feel like doing anything except for lying around.  Don't put it off too much longer, because you want to spend those last few weeks eating ice cream, and writing thank you cards, not assembling a crib!|`|LiPoEBenaa	Wow, I'm a little bit of a worry wart...but I'm done. The nursery is finished and the only thing I have left on my list to get is a baby thermometer. I got the last of everything I needed at my baby shower this past weekend. I would start getting stuff now! What if you go in to labor early? I have a good friend of mine who is on strict bed rest due to pre-eclampsia. She developed it just a few days ago and has already been to labor and delivery twice! I would hate to come home and not have a place for my little one to rest!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	At 12 weeks we did our baby registries and started buying clothes.  We also check out the clearance merchandise in the baby section of every store to look for great deals on things we will need later.  I am 16 weeks now and would have everything done except that we have to wait for our baby shower.  We have the bedding and nursery decor and five bags of clothing, but we can't buy much else until we see what we get at the shower.  I love being prepared early!|`|W0d6NsGBaa	I am 37 weeks....I am almost done with the nursery....will be finishing that up this week. All her clothes are washed and hung up. I have bought everything I need and its all clean and ready to go. I could not imagine having nothing done before she arrived!

L'unica cosa magari vai quando devi comprare dell'altro cos limiterai la vergogna infilandoli tra l'altra roba che compri.

63b11e8f6fd39d78c7cfee71167581ecaa	That sounds really obsessive If you're awake 16 hours a day that means you have to be texting at least once every 2 minutes. A) Who has that much free time? and B) Who are you texting all day? Don't bother talking to her about cutting down kids -myself included- never realize how much we text and cutting down to us is minimal but, we think its a lot. Just tell her you're cutting the plan down to only so many per week/month or only unlimited to these people. Show her the bill when she goes over that'll have an effect on her seeing how much she costs by texting.|`|GdhShV7Vaa	this is totally normal for your child even at her my daughter is 18 she got her phone 4 weeks ago she texts 1,000 times so far how do i know? i check her account i mean its totally normal but she should have her mind on homework collage or school if she still does school or is in collage and if u dint like that she is testing so much tell her if she wants to text she can only text 50 times ADA for the limit one time my daughter TXT 88 times in a day do its not going to give your daughter any trouble like shes on crack or anything cut the chill lets teens do what teens do my rule for my daughter is do not taboo smoke or do drugs her curfew is 1030 she does something bad gets grounded for two weeks but she never did the only thing that she ever day bad was late for her curfew once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and many more but if your aught er is not in school and all she does is text then tell her to go outside get air or something i am trying to say taxing is NT a bad thing but not technically a good thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|hXQjnPuGaa	400-600 a day is not normal. The  most I've ever sent in one day was 200( I average about 75 perday, that day there was a lot going on), and people call me an obsessive texter.    I don't think it's really something to worry about though, unless she's neglecting the other things in her life. |`|FiUprYsvaa	I send about 300 a day.   Over 2000 a month.    She is just having convos with her friends via text. Text messages add up very quickly, especially if you are texting back and forth with a few friends at once and especially if she does it every day.     Normal is in the eye of the beholder. Its fine as long as its not affecting her at work or school.     But she is 18 and at college so she is no longer under your control so there isn't much you can do about it.|`|XQk73tiOaa	Haha yesss.  I'm only 15, but my friends and I are exactly the same.|`|Xh1eI6KOaa	That is pretty ridiculous.  But text messaging is the new popular way to communicate.|`|b0yNkuUjaa	Absolutely!! Kids these days no longer talk on the phone texting is way more in.|`|ukwEzumdaa	yes. normal. |`|ddNqm6V3aa	i fink its  not normal at all she should be busy in studies or work at this age I am sure that she got someone who she texts to u better found out before it gets too late|`|VX8vnM22aa	Well it would be normal if she was a little younger but at work!?! That's not too good.|`|azIA2rmRaa	The 400-600 part. Not so normal.  Obsessive texting. Very normal for this generation.|`|4Z7z3CL5aa	umm...there is no way i send that much! i know some people do, but i honestly don't think i would have that much to say. i can't imagine whats so important to send that many! i don't think its normal.|`|5dvAclmVaa	Definitely a lot of texts but for an 18 yr old this seems normal. Texting is all everyone wants to do now. No one picks up the phone anymore to make a call.    Hopefully she has unlimited texting|`|yftgJMaQaa	Wow, I'd say that's probably too much.  I did 100 in one day and I barely got anything accomplished.      If she's in college and just entering the work environment I'd reminder about prioritizing.      On the bright side, she must have a lot of friends : )|`|iHnorEAwaa	It's completely normal to text, but 400-600 a day is not.  That's about 17-25 texts an hour.  I think I send that much in a day.  (I'm seventeen.)    Maybe I'm just friends with a lot of people who don't have cell phones/texting.|`|gSv9qk95aa	Totally normal.  I do the same, I'm doing it as I type this haha and it's sad.|`|HnqRAqtTaa	I'm seventeen and don't text, pssh I don't even own a cell phone. However, I know many teenage girls who text like 24/7, I overheard a girl on the bus saying that her average is 15000 texts a month.|`|9b8WXwTXaa	I don't think that's normal for somebody to text that much. Thank God for unlimited texting or you would be broke. She must be the world's fastest texter, and her fingers must be in very good shape.|`|9mKunwmMaa	Yeah I no a lot of people who text so much. Texting is better then calling because of scientists finding out about how talking to much on one is causing cancer|`|ygPusaDWaa	OMG that is totally normal!    i text like 1000 or so a day.   but i have a sidekick so its easier for me to text so fast.    lay off a lil.  shes a teenager!|`|wpUDVoMSaa	thats not normal..  600 per day?|`|sybMFVRcaa	yup yup  i hope you have unlimited....lol|`|EMjR8DQGaa	Sadly, yes this is normal.|`|bOIl6MGXaa	well yes it is sweetie!!! that's the best way to bug your freinds!!!|`|qgpBbzOBaa	10 to 1 says 50% of those are dirty texts. Thats ALL my ex and I did.|`|kOvAy4t0aa	Sounds like a pretty shallow life.|`|1IMLVGT2aa	VERY excessive I think. We have 3 kids (ages 11, 12 and 13) on our plan and we have opted out for them so they don't text!!|`|5kjSp4Y7aa	yes its normal you dont have to worry|`|ZYICyUAGaa	That does seem like a lot, but not totally out of the norm.|`|bMPyOigpaa	depends on how many people she is friends with, if she has a lot of friends than no, if she only has 4 or 5 than yes   |`|BIxQcd3Waa	defnitely normal  my record is 25,164 in one month    and im 13 :)|`|fq9CqhUYaa	i would say it is. thats alot but i guess if you have time on your hands then yea its totally normal. |`|lTsPX04jaa	600 a day.. eh thats over a little|`|KSc287ddaa	it is normal but i am 17 and i don not send that many.|`|i171LlfTaa	Its pretty normal if shes one of those "popular" kids.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	She isn't a kid anymore Mom, 18 is an adult!  Yes it's normal, but not a good thing.|`|nkZdtXXhaa	That is a BIT excessive, but I'm not really surprised.  Texting is addictive.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	For kids today...  Probably.    Kids are constantly texting in class, whether it's allowed or not. ** shrugs **|`|vJEatJFPaa	yes. im 21 and am a txting nut. i have verizon and we have unlimited txt...for some reason its easier keeping in contact with people this way!|`|qBmhyFXtaa	600 a day?? A bit extreme I'd say. I only send like 3000 a month! :D|`|NNki7qiFaa	yeah..  but even I don't send that many texts..|`|4tArWetUaa	Well I think that is a bit more than normal.   Perhaps take away her unlimited texting and get her 1500 a month or something. That is WAY to much for one day.    If she goes over, make HER pay for it.    I pay for my own cell. I think that kids need to start pulling their own weight and not rely on their parents to pay for THEIR things|`|AA10341425	yeah i text alot! and im a guy|`|mazNEiuyaa	Yes it is so normal. I text all the time. Infact my boyfirend had to make our plane unlimited text bc i was going over and it was way more expensive to go over then to change your plan.So you might want to consider that if she text that much . I cost me 2.50 for each text that i went over so thats why he changed it for me. I text more then i talk sometimes. But yes to your answer. And i have a 16 yealr old niece and she text alot to .
sQpVPj0paa	My experience (as an anesthesiology resident) is that many people don't really like the way that the IV or intra-muscular medications make them feel. Some people feel tired or loopy, and many say they still feel the pain, it just doesn't bother them as much. For some people it works just fine, mind you.     At my center we use a patient-controlled device (ie push the button) and will turn it off when delivery is imminent. This is because the medications (fentanyl and remifentanyl) can make the baby sleepy or decrease her rate of respirations when she's born. Fortunately these drugs are short-lasting and can be reversed if necessary. In centers where they're still using demerol/pethidine, which last longer but potentially have more side. There are no long term side effects for the baby for any of these drugs.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I had Nubain but no epi. My baby had no problems, although it can cause respiratory distress in some babies (as can the epidural). It did nothing for the pain except make me not care about it and relax me in between contractions. Had I not already been awake since 4 a.m. by that point (I delivered at 11 a.m.) I probably wouldn't even have had that, but I was pretty exhausted.     I think this next time I'll even refuse that, since it really doesn't block the pain and I felt everything anyway.|`|VClxXNs3aa	I had stadol, and I wont bother with it again in the future - It didnt help my pain at all.... my baby was fine, I ended up getting an epidural when I saw the stadol wouldnt help.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I refuse to get an epidural. But when I had my son at age 16 I was in labor for 30 hours and they talked me into getting some pain meds. through my IV. I will never do that again!! Not only did it not help with the pain, but all it did was make me loopy and sleepy. I don't remember half of anything after they gave it to me, even the delivery. I pushed for 45 minutes. I was so tired and weak afterward, all I wanted to do was sleep. I feel like I missed out on those precious moments after birth with him. The baby was groggy but okay. So 9 years later with my second baby, I decided all natural. So much better! I was awake and alert. I pushed for 15 minutes. Felt great afterward. No fatigue, no recovery time. So again I chose natural for my third. Again everything went wonderfully. I pushed twice. No recovery time after the birth. So I plan on all natural again with this baby. The pain is intense at times. Mostly during pushing. But that only lasts a little bit and it then it is over.|`|tRNwh2yxaa	I took an IV several hours before I delivered, and it made me really, really high.  By the time it wore off, my labor was very intense and I wasn't prepared for it because I had been so dazed.  I wound up asking for an epidural towards the very end.  My baby was okay- she was a little gray, but she had also had the cord around her neck.  She pinked up as soon as I breastfed.
Uy8ntukjaa	You can tell the sex of a baby at about three months because that is when their genitals start forming fully. If she went to a clinic they have already shown her what her options are. There is really nothing you can do to convince her not to have one if she is decided. Unfortunately it is her decision. As to not getting mad or blowing up at her just tell her you can't agree with her choice so you'd rather she not talk to you about it anymore. It upsets you too much.|`|iAtnlKf5aa	the only way you can be supportive of your friend's dilemma and not compromise your beliefs is to offer her another choice. ask her if she has considered adopting out her child. a lot of people want to adopt.          however, if she chooses to have an abortion, try not to be judgemental. remember, it is her choice, even if you disagree w/ that choice.|`|E7ISlaYJaa	In my opinion, it's not your place to persuade her not to abort the baby.  It's her life, her baby, she and guy's decision.      What about adoption? It doesn't have to be an abortion, or keeping the baby.  If her reasons for not wanting a child are because she wants to be "famous", she really won't want an abortion haunting her.      She doesn't need you to persuade her,  as a friend you need to be there with her to help her get information that will help her make a decision that is right for her.|`|9sfeFdI8aa	Legally it's her decision. However in most states even if the mother is on her way to an abortion clinic and is murdered, the murderer is usually charged with killing the mother and child. I know it's off topic, but can't help but find that interesting|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	You cant convince her not to or anything else. You have told her your views and that is all you can do.ln the end it is her decision even if you dont agree with it. Just try to be there for her if you want to, if you dont want to support it then dont.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Show her a video of a 12 week abortion.  Seriously!  If that doesn't change her mind, then nothing will.  There is one in particular that I'm thinking of- it's called "The Silent Scream" and you can find it on youtube.  Here's a link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjNo_0cW-...  Clinics will do ultrasounds but I don't think they can tell the sex of the baby at 12 weeks.
KEIQix4Maa	....Yes, you can.  Nobody will consider you a run away.  It may be more difficult to get gainful employment, housing and utilities, but you can do it.|`|FTW82Wumaa	Nope. 18 you can. If you leave now, they can call the cops and have you brought back home. Also, you have to be 18 to rent an apartment.|`|bae3b34f8cfcdb7878e0d8bfe7de1948aa	You have to be emancipated. As far as I know, there is no state that legally allows you to move with the approval of your parents at 17. Search emancipation and see if they have any information on your state. I doubt this will go over well your parents.|`|ed25bf373713e43686b2626ac2dfb0deaa	Sorry I can't help because I'm in Australia but you can move out at 14 or 15 and the only thing the parents can do is go to the police station and DoCS and they will tell your parents, there is nothing at all they can do.|`|AA11155768	Have you considered attending a college in another town or state?  Sometimes parents do things that upset us and there's nothing you can do about it but make the best of it. The best thing is to slow down and weigh your options. What could you accomplish by running away from the problem? What will you do once you are in Tennessee? Will you have enough money to support yourself in case you don't find employment right away? etc.     Attending college would be a much better option. It's the same advice I gave my niece when she wanted to get away from home. She's now 20, making good grades, has an apartment with one of her classmates, and self-supporting. She's also much happier in the long run!    Good luck!|`|zgooUZ1zaa	You actually can move out.  It depends on if you want to take certain steps like trying to become an emancipated minor.  Which means that you can live on your own, but that take time and by the time that you go thought that process you may turn 18. Another option would be to try and get accepted to a college early. Which means that you would be out of your household.  You also could try and just move out , but since you are a minor you would have to have your parents permission to get a job which means that you may have a lot of extra headaches such as rent utilities and bills.  The best thing to do is to hang in there and enjoy the time that you have, making someone else be responsible for you. Cause when you turn 18 you are responsible for yourself.|`|db02bcc2eeac2a1b17eed769a65dd718aa	nope ntb 18|`|klMshAQMaa	i think you have to be 18 to work legally   so you just migh want to wait till you turn 18.|`|bQq1QL4xaa	Yep. You're 17. You can legally move out.     EDIT: I live in GA and you are allowed to move out at 17.|`|hg0ce5uEaa	i want to move to tennessee too. i think your still underparetnal controll untill your 18 though.... good luck you can make it. stay strong and focus on your dreams!|`|9HZ1endAaa	yes. basically, depending on where you live, u can file for emancipation and the govt will review your case. if they think its appropriate, you are legally free from your parents' responsibility.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_em...|`|MSGixNibaa	You're only a year away from total freedom (in a sense). Get a fastfood job and start saving every penny, then head for Tennessee on your birthday. You can do it. :D|`|E94q1IrUaa	you ahve to get emancipated
619a2003fc4308b68dc4b581fb6eaa7caa	I have the same problems and I am 34 weeks its your body getting ready for labor|`|Gr78AFvyaa	Its just a part of being pregnant. the pain is ligaments and bones stretching and getting ready for labor. sit back, relax, and take a nice warm bubble bath while you can! you don't have to much longer to go.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	this is perfectly normal your body is just preparing for the birthing process.  as long as your not bleeding everything is ok.|`|wBpennsMaa	Your body is preparing for labor lucky! I am 36 weeks and 4 days and still haven't experienced dropping/settling. I'm going to be induced.
AA11155768	As the first poster mentioned, it sounds like reflux. See your pediatricion. Until then, make sure your son takes in as little air as possible during feeding and make sure he's in a semi-upright position during feeding.  Burp him well (over the shoulder making sure his stomach is at shoulder level). It's the shoulder pressure that actually helps encourage burping and try for a second burp. Also, avoid laying him down after feeding and don't overfeed.     Good luck.|`|MjashZnvaa	You should take him to the pediatrician, he could have reflux. |`|9t171ji1aa	sounds like he has reflux. take him to the dr and get it under control and he will feel alot better.|`|WJe4yS1Taa	You mean spits up. That is normal all babies spit up & get hiccups. If you are real concerned contact your pediatrician.

I've also seen Jeanine.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I would say Janine. I've also seen it spelled Jeanne and pronounced "Jin-een'"
RPszYGXkaa	Well definitely within 2 - 3 weeks.  It is good that some progress is started, but you could be that way for weeks.  It is true, labor happens when it happens!  It could start tonight or 3 weeks from now.  Best wishes.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I was 2cm dilated and still didn't have her for another month.  Sorry but you may still have a couple weeks left.  Good luck hun|`|lzUF22l0aa	honestly dont listen to anyone im 35 weeks and ive been 1 cm for 4 weeks it doesnt mean anything. But heres some hope it could all happen at once. The baby will come when he or she is ready but you could try walking i have heard it does help. Good luck hope your little bundle comes soon i know how terrible it can be.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I don't think it means much to be honest.  I'm from New Zealand and they don't do internals on you before you go into labour to check how dilated you are.  I think it sets you up for thinking you are going to go early when you might not.  Just be patient and the baby will come when it is ready!!  It can be anytime between 38 and 42 weeks on average.  Good luck!|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	you may or may not go early.  I was dilated to 3 from about 36 wks wiht my first and still had to be induced at 42 wks|`|nPiYCgWLaa	Technically it could be another few weeks. I'm 40 weeks right now and have been dilated since 28 weeks. I had preterm labor issues, but obviously they were able to stop the labor! I'm just saying that you could very easily go to your due date, or you could go into labor tonight. You just never know. Try walking and sex to get things going. Both of those things seem to be moving things right along for me! Good luck...
GZrR0uxjaa	it could definitely be too early...for some women they dont get a positive till about a week after their expected period, so either wait a few more days or week and if no period, test again, make sure you test in the morning with the first urine of the day, thats when the hormones are at their highest good luck!|`|NaYb4CnGaa	your morely likely to receive a false neg. then positive so wait a few more weeks or go to a doc and have a blood test done, it can tell you now and its alot more accurate. Good Luck|`|GZNhWblzaa	my test was wrong so test again in a few days|`|Hhifw93laa	give it a couple more days then try again or go to the doc it sounds like you are prego God Bless|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Those do sound like some pregnancy symptoms you could have just tested a little early. Wait a few more days and if you still havent gotten your period test again.|`|sxmQSpagaa	give it two weeks and test again. only you know if there's cause for suspicion. did you have unprotected sex around the middle of the month?
zrhrJQvtaa	For daytime they make these watches that he can't tamper with that remind him to use the bathroom. For night time I think Pull-ups or Goodnites are fine because there are a lot of kids his age that wet the bed. I would still talk to his doctor for both issues.|`|AA11155768	Please be careful with some of the advice that was given. The best advice is to discuss this with your doctor. There could be physical or emotional reasons for his problem. Whatever you do, do not blame him or punish him for it. If he has anxiety about going to the potty, have him go with another child near his age or a little older, perhaps an older brother or cousin that he looks up to, to 'show him the ropes'. Also, don't let anyone else know about his problem unless it is absolutely necessary. This could end up being embarrassing for him and only worsen the problem    Good luck and God bless!|`|83t9G4gcaa	What does your ped say about his behavior? Perhaps identifying stressors which exist in his life and then taking steps to resolve that stress may help. I have a friend who's son soiled his pants throughout elementary school It was suggested that the child did so because it was the only thing he felt he could control in his life.  Allow your son to go pull-up free over the weekend and if/when he soils, put him in charge of doing his own laundry... not as punishment, but as a way to show him he's now the responsible party in making a change.|`|D8gFfDwuaa	Only drinking water is very unhealthy.    Limits drinks before bed - from about an hour. I went thru the same thing and i remember dying of thirst, so if he really needs some let him have some.    Wake him up every 3-6 hours. Just to make him go potty.     There is a pill but he is still too young.     Pull Ups are good for now but try to wait him up. |`|iVVtBjhXaa	Our daughter was having the peeing problem.  We told her if she does it anymore, we take away her tv privileges.  It worked so it must have been she was doing it for attention.  Is he having problems in school?  |`|vHV8HQmGaa	well my aunt got her kids to be potty trained by letting them pick out their own underwear/boxers. they didn't like the underwear my aunt bought for them, so they didn't care if they got them dirtied. but then they started picking out their own spider man underwear, they never peed or pooped in them since...|`|Qt6rTy5faa	Take him to his doctor ASAP. There may be a medical reason for this.    Good luck to the poor little guy! |`|SZcOWswyaa	this could be because he has bad dreams so if that is true than try talking to him |`|eEr6hUD4aa	Make him getting use to waking up and going to the bathroom or never mind|`|UgZq1pXjaa	Keep the diapers on and see what the doctor thinks|`|on8kswmeaa	THis is a problem that may be due to bladder issues, I have a 13 year old who has bladder problems (these are permanent and will never go away). You need to take your son to the doctor asap. My daughter has to wear diapers
9Y1W2bTaaa	I do the same thing with my niece and nephew. You may think it doesn't count with me because i'm a girl, but it's absolutely fine for guys too. I don't really feel like I will want kids of my own for many reasons, but when I'm around them I just get all happy and like to spend time with them. For halloween I even went walking with my sister and her daughter and was holding her hand too, I kinda felt like I was even hogging her :)  But I think it's a combination on what the 1st person said and they make you feel happier and lift your spirits that you can't help feeling that way! I've even considered one day having kids because of them, but then i realize it's completely different when they're your own! ;)|`|BrRc8IPraa	No it's not strange at all, and you shouldn't seek professional help. Well I mean if you really wanted to you could I guess. But it just means that you have that fatherly instinct, and you're lucky to have it!     Plus, girls dig a guy who's sweet to babies. Or at least I do. :)|`|Mr9VHZ2Gaa	It is a totally normal instinct to act like a 'parent' around young children. Your nephew is lucky to have you around. Boys need many good role models around so you should feel good about being there for him and helping him learn about the world.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	It's natural to take a parenting role when you're around small children. They're so innocent and curious that you want to keep them safe from things you know can hurt them. |`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	I think it's normal for a male to have this feeling.  I hope that when you really become a father that you'll be a great one.  I've never been an Aunt, have friends with young kids and that's how I feel with their kids.  It doesn't make me abnormal.    As long as there isn't any sexual desires or deviance happening to the child then you're normal.|`|c51o7yqtaa	Does your nephew have his dad in his life? If not, then I'd say that it would be perfectly normal to want to look out for him and give him that father figure.  However. Children can have many different role models. Boys really need a good male role models, I believe, in order to help ensure that they become good men.  That's the reason there is the Big Brother/Big Sister program.|`|AA11155768	It's not strange at all. You are just being a proud uncle. I was the same way (still am) with all 5 of my nieces and nephews. Congratulations! Just don't have any children of your own until you've finished your education and are financially secure.
14pjwQPLaa	You know, most schools give you the same amount of time to make up work that you were out -- for example, if you were out for three days, you have three days to make up work.  Check your school's policy on that -- the teacher sounds like he is being a real jerk.     Go to your counselor or principal and explain what happened, that you tried to work it out with the teacher and he was uncooperative, he didn't give you a straight answer when you asked for the homework, and you are willing to do the work, but he won't allow you to.    On the other hand, make VERY sure of your timeline before you go to the counselor or principal.  It's a little unusual for a teacher to assign a project that is going to be worth almost half of your grade and only give you three days to do it -- which means you may have known ahead of time that the project was coming up if you were paying attention?    Hint:  If you know you're going to get screwed on the grade, then be proactive and tell your parents BEFORE report cards come out -- as a matter of fact, discuss it with them NOW, and ask them to come with you to the principal when you discuss the problem.  That way, there are no unpleasant surprises and you might have an effective advocate.    PS:  75 is not a great mark, but being grounded for 4 months is a little extreme . . .  |`|H4OlfmOaaa	talk to a counselor and see if you can get a different math teacher... that way if you do better your parents will realize it was the teachers fault.|`|AA11155768	Wow, this sounds like something I would have written at your age. I was also sickly while growing up.    First things first, make sure you are doing absolutely everything you are suppose to be doing to make sure you succeed in school. Being sick a lot makes it harder to get the work done AND makes it easier to make excuses. This is where you have to push to succeed.     Second, if you know your parents aren't going to accept your reasons for not making better grades, it's time to go to another responsible adult. Try your schools guidance counselor. Show him/her your work and explain why you were unable to get it turned in on time. Make friends with the students who DO pay attention in school so you'll always know what needs to be done. You should also be able to speak to your guidance counselor about the situation with your parents. He/She could request a conference with your parents to review your school work and grades and offer suggestions to help with your special needs.     Whatever you do, don't sit around and let things get worse. If your counselor doesn't offer to help, seek out an Aunt, Uncle, Grandparent, family friend or neighbor.    Good luck and God bless.|`|TkT2oKAfaa	I know what you mean, I hate math.|`|p4wW3Dpnaa	You need to talk to your counselor and principal about this.  They should be the most help.    Or tell your parents the situation, and make them take to the teacher.      The teenagers at our school ended up getting our math teacher fired because he was such a jerk! He wasn't right for the school AT ALL. Keep in mind I go to a charter school ran by hippies, hehe!|`|qENyQSnNaa	  you r right  u r not your brother.  I wanted my kids to do better too.  there is no right answer except the truth.  Perfection was only there in God.  Your brother isn't, your folks aren't  and you are aren't.  School is not your strong side, but, there is something you are good at.  If you know what it is, bring it to their attention, and for yourself....develop it  
VfmwKkGwaa	It sounds a bit like a miscarriage to me,but i would find another doctor and get a second opinion.|`|AA11155768	Are you trying to get pregnant? Are you on any birth control? It could very well have been a very early miscarriage or just a false positive...especially if you are on any medication. |`|Dhig2g6Kaa	its normal for your period to be different every month, but still doesn't explain the one pos pregnancy test, but then it turns out to be neg.... i wish that i had more for you but i don't,,,,|`|oRJ3GpUtaa	I would go have a blood test done then you will know for sure...I personally wouldn't trust a test that costs 99 cents.|`|S545jx81aa	I agree you should get a blood test done. False positives are rare but possible. but just to be sure i would have a blood test done and if it still says neg. you can ask for an ultrasound and see if they will give you one, that is the only way you can tell for sure.... good luck. 
AA11155768	Is your sister aware of this? If not, pull her aside and let her know what you've observed. It's up to your sister to take action at this point. Make sure you are approaching her in a non-accusatory manner and don't bother trying to tell her WHAT to do...you just need to make sure she is aware of it. If your sister fails to respond and you feel the child is in danger, then you have a responsibility to report this to child protective services. |`|14izGC5qaa	how about, u hold him and when he wants to take him give him to him the way your suposed to hold a baby      yes you should tell your sister, its best for the baby|`|MNyYWoFfaa	Tell him that studies have been done that if you don't give an infant support on their neck an head it can affect them later on life (which is true).|`|Mr9VHZ2Gaa	Definitely voice your concerns. As long as you are sensitive to your sister's feelings being honest is the best approach. Let her know how you feel and that if something happens to him and you didn't say anything that would be much much worse.    You could always show your brother in law different 'techniques' for holding a baby :)    But remember it is their baby...they may not listen and you shouldn't push it once you tell them your thoughts and feelings otherwise they may start to push you away.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	just show him how to protect his head or i wouldnt let him hold him til he did.
lDS11bJHaa	If your mom tells your sister about her findings, she is going to be very hurt and her trust will be broken. If you guys dont' have a close enough relationship to talk openly about it. Maybe have your mom bring up the subject of sex and pregnancy, and asking about birth control. If she is sexually active now, she isn't going to stop just because your mom found out. I would say this. "I know you are sexually active, and I want you to be careful. How would you feel about taking birth control?" Just make sure your mom has time to cool down before she does this.    Hope this helps|`|nbSp469Waa	Why would your sister hold a stick in her purse that someone else pee'd on.  That's gross.  You mom should just ask her if they are her's and if she says no, your mom can't prove that she is lying, and if you sis fesses up to them, then your mom should be thinking about putting her on birth control|`|3MwyejO7aa	Sit your sister down and you talk to her.  I think she would hear it better coming from you than from your mother.|`|4QTHSTbbaa	well etleast she wasnt pregnant.   You might want to ask her about it and get her on birth control.|`|AA11155768	This is a very sensitive subject. How old are you? It might be easier if your sister found out from you and then goes to your mother for a chat. Otherwise, your mom should definitely speak to her. If your sister is having sex, a pregnancy test would indicate she's not being very responsible. Your mom has approach her calmly and in a non-accusatory manner and with an open mind. Your sister will be angry but this is not something to be ignored.|`|9gv1B73kaa	I think at 17 years old, it should be within her rights to get pregnant or not without her mothers input.   asking about it is one thing,  but i dont think she has the right to actually say anything negative about it.
rNvXWMOMaa	Put him over your knee and give him a spanking,  that's what a good parent would do.|`|b8VHk8FXaa	if u dnt believe in spanking ur so i think that u should punish him in ways like takin a toy every time he does something like cursing.and he will eventually realize that its wrong.and if u take him to counselin wit u and ur wife he may hear things that u dnt want him to but the bright side is that he may realize that mommy and daddy arent perfect and their are consequences for ur actions as well|`|TQge2oBVaa	Well, I first of all think that swearing is not exactly "adult" behavior. While adults do it, it is actually very childish to curse more than very rarely. He is probably learning it from you, but kids are learning things like this at a VERY young age in school now. I answered a question just the other day about a kid that was the same age telling everybody how to have sex. I think you two should get couseling that teaches you how to argue in a healthy way. You don't want to mess up the kids life by getting a divorce. Yes you need a job, but she needs to know how to start an argument about it, and you need to learn how to counteract her argument, all in a respectful manor. That is one of the hardest stages of marraige, but for the marraige to go well, you need to tell yourself that you are above falling prey to it. What do you mean by taking him to counseling when you and your wife "go"?    EDIT:    OK, I just understood that last sentence which changes my answer a little bit. FOCUS your counseling on arguing healthily. And ask your couneslor if he can help you show your kid that cursing is bad, and that the fights don't relate to him. You should definitely take your kid with if the councelor can help with this.|`|VNXeiDZKaa	I also think that you should focus on healthier ways to argue and be able to show this to your son. Tension is bad for any child, but seeing it being resolved in healthy ways is also healthy and they learn to do this from you. It's possible he learned it from you, but just as likely that he learned it at school. If this is the only way that he's acting like an adult, then I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just be sure to outline the consequences for him for swearing at you or in public because, usually, they're going to swear anyway, just not where you can hear, once they start. Also, if he's swearing at you or in other ways acting like an adult, then sorry to say, he's been learning that he has to in order to deal with you or situations he finds himself in. Children don't take on adult roles unless they feel they have to. Personally, I view swearing as an emotional expression, though when dealing with someone I care about, swearing is kept to a minimum in tense situations due to the fact that there can be an automatic emotional response that the person is either angrier than they really are or may become verbally abusive. The threat of such things can often lead to more misunderstandings and overreactions than the actual verbal abuse. What I mean is, I might swear, but not AT the person. |`|ky7BXYecaa	It's as simple as teaching him that its great to know these words and know when others are being bad, but using these words also leads to others thinking you're bad(AKA consequences). To "ween" him off swear words you might want to get a cookie jar filled with scraps of paper each with a different chore written on it. When anyone in the family uses a bad word they must take one chore. It also must be remembered that words are words and it is only an opinion of society that these combined letters are "bad".|`|eRVRWwkBaa	Stop swearing because he is learning it from you. And since, if I am understanding this right, you are already going to counseling why don't you ask your therapist? And do talk to him and tell him you love him and you love each other and it's grownup problems and not related to him. He is a kid but kids are smart and I'm quite sure he hears everything. Things are rough now yes, and if your home a lot of the time why don't you spend quality time with him. Many parents wish they had more time to spend with their children and you have the opportunity now take advantage of it. |`|sw2R5A9iaa	your child is modeling behavior, so look at his role models!  ignore behaviors that you don't want to encourage and get rid of the TV.  society asks that our children grow up too quickly.  slow down.  get some marriage counseling and start respecting yourself, so that you can treat your family members kinder.|`|AA11155768	Your son is definitely getting this from you. In some states, using profanity within hearing range of a child is considered abuse. Shame on and you and your wife for behaving like children. Couples should NEVER use profanity in an argument nor should they throw objects at each other. Matter of fact, yelling is also completely unnecessary and inappropriate. Think of what you are teaching your child. Marriage is hard work at any stage! You and your wife must learn appropriate ways for dealing with your anger immediately. Your son would not need to attend counseling with you and your wife unless there is no change in his behavior after Mom and Dad improve their behavior.    Please work diligently to improve your behavior before your son reaches the point of no return! Good luck and God bless!|`|o6uwV66jaa	It's a learned habbit . .  smarten up and your child will too.|`|wihrLsUKaa	Children will mimic your behavior 100%.  Also if they are in a household with a lot of yelling they will think that is normal human behavior and will carry it over to all of their relationships.  Most of the time causing the demise of relationships.     As far as you not having a job at work right now, the economy is terrible. Those in middle management jobs are feeling the loss first as they are considered "expendable".  However, you never ever want to put each other down in front of the child.      You really should be careful about this.  This type of behavior will help mold your child into the adult just like ya'll are acting like.  I know from personal experience, My parents fought and yelled and cussed all of the time, hence when I got married I treated my husband the same way.  Difficult lesson to learn I will tell you that!  On our two year anniversary my first husband asked me for a divorce, looking back, I am surpirsided he put up witj me fo so long.  Please consider getting your child counceling, and the two of you counseling.  You own the innocent one in the family.    I really wish ya'll luck and the maturity to put your own selfish causes based on your marriage. Please please think of the little child that you may be potentially ruining for the rest of their lives!     I really wish you two luck!  When my husband I were having problems, (my current one's), it would scare my child to death and so both his father and I would have to reasure him that everything woud be ok. that it was NOT his problem to solve, and more than anything, both of his parents loved him dearly.   My best wishes to you and your family,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2b0jHiJXaa	Yes, your situation is stressful.  Yes, you feel like you want to run away.  Should you do it though?  NO!    The bond of *unconditional* love between a parent and child is the strongest, most wonderful in the universe.  Please don't abandon that because things are tough right now.    You think that things are hard for you right now, and they are.  But please think about how hard it must be for your Mom right now too.  Try to imagine what it would be like to have a daughter whom she loves so much, but have no way to support her properly because of her disability.  Try to imagine the pain that she must have to endure every day.      If the situation was reversed, more than likely, your Mother would NEVER abandon you.     It is only in the recent 20th century that people started to abandon their parents as soon as they went off to school.    Believe me when I tell you that once she is gone (passed away) it is too late.  Once she is gone, she is gone forever.    My beloved Mother died in 2001 and not a day goes by that I don't wish that she were still alive.  As I watch my own beautiful daughter grow up, I am sometimes overcome with pain that she will never know my Mom.    Please don't shut her out of your life like others have suggested.  She is the ONLY Mom that you have and that is worth more than all of the gold in the world.|`|ZEO7RhGzaa	I know EXACTLY what you are going through.  I'm dealing with the same stuff with my mom.    I know it's hard to deal with, but what your mom really needs is your support.  You're probably the closest person in her life, right?  Take that as a compliment :) If she is in that much pain, she can't go out and get a job, but you can talk to her about getting a job at home.      My mom doesn't work either, and mooches off of my money(and my dads! they're divorced!). I'm only 16 and get minimum wage..it sucks but I feel almost like I owe her and that it's the right thing to do.    but I agree, your money is YOUR money. You earn it, you get to keep it.  She has no right to take it from you or make you feel bad for not giving it to her.|`|AA11155768	Sadly this has become all too common in this day and age. First, please don't do anything irrational. It's going to be hard to stick it out until you graduate high school but you must. If possible, find a part time job, volunteer work, or after school activities to fill some of your time. It'll give you a break from home life and will be rewarding to you when planning your future. Second, find a college in another town. Check with your school counselor to see if there are any scholarships you can apply for that wil help with tuition. Don't forget to research grants also. You want to avoid student loans if at all possible. Third, find support in other family members and friends. Getting through this will be easier if you can find a willing ear to vent on. Go to college and work hard. Plan your future carefully. Set a goal to finish school and buy a house by the age of 25. While in college, get a credit card with a low interest rate and keep it put away for emergencies only! Save money wherever you can and keep a real budget.    In a few years, you'll be completely independent of your mother and will only have to deal with her on holidays and birthdays.     Please note, your mother is an adult, you cannot change her and it is not your fault that things are this way. I wish you the best!|`|U8GwHmDiaa	The person above is 100% right.|`|r9EzmntWaa	dude smoke some weed it makes everything better, she should too, itd be good for her pain|`|10311365789606113f4eb728aaeb5c30aa	don't abandon your mother. i know this whole thing must stress u out completely, and u have to let her know that. u need to tell her that u need to concentrate on ur grades and u dont want to be poor when u are older and u want to be able to help her and she cant make u crazy because once u are 18, ur money is ur money and not hers and u dont want her to drive her so insane that u wouldnt want to help her, u want to be able to because u love her but she cant treat u like this! say all this very calmly and privately. your life is your life. but your mother is your mother. you have 2 options:    (A) - run away from home and leave your poor mother to die, as well as abandoning all hope of ever graduating and getting into a good school with no money or highschool diploma if you become a street kid, never talking to your mother ever again and once she becomes seriously ill or worse from the pain you caused her of leaving, u will be miserable your entire life.    or...    (B) - find a comman ground. help your mother. understand what she is going through. but tell her you need to be able to focus on your grades and school because supporting her is so important to u when u are older, even if you are no longer legally responsable. and do just that. help her out. find a way for her to get money, maybe get a nanny or something to help her around the house better if need be. just don't abandon her. go to college next year, but think about leaving her. is it better you leave or stay? would she honeslty be able to make it without you there with her? can she live alone? maybe she really does need help. help your mother. make choices. but please remember to make the right ones.    hope i helped :)|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	Okay first, your money is your money. You need is for school. You need to tell her that, and she needs to understand that. As the adult, she needs to be willing to help you pursue your college dreams. It would be wrong of her to accept money that is not hers.    Secondly, your mother needs help. She needs to talk to a doctor, who can refer her to someone who can help her with her mental problems. Talk to a guidance counsellor at school to find out about possible low to no-cost community resources that might be available for her.    Good luck, I hope it all turns out well for you.|`|joMS61Qfaa	wow. I feel for you. My mom has seriouse depression and I go through the same thing. She too is a single mother. I am only in ninth grade! I dont get out for years. My mom isnt working eather. So we to are on welfare. If I knew how to help you, I would, but right now Im just trying to figure things out for myself.   I am normally a straight A student, and I got my report card todaay and I have a c- and c's. I cant concentrate either. When you find the answer, wich I truly hope u do, would u let me know too?  Hope it works out.   -Kaitlyn
AA11155768	This does not appear to be a serious post but just in case, I will respond.     Children make mistakes and they don't always listen. Don't forget, you were her age at one time yourself. Your daughter is sexually active and there is nothing you can do about it. Part of being a parent is loving our children unconditionally. How would you feel if something happened to your daughter and grandchild because you were angry and put her out of your home? How would you feel if you never got the chance to see your grandchildren?    Ask your daughter to come back home and work on the relationship you have with her. In the meantime, make sure she gets the proper care and finishes school. I hope things work out for you.|`|ZEO7RhGzaa	I would have done the same thing to be honest.  There is no way I would be supporting my daughters baby, it's not your fault she got pregnant.  She should have respected your wishes and talked to you.  It's her fault and she needs to take responsibility.    I do agree that you should support her, but you DO NOT have to help her financially or otherwise.  It is up to her to support this baby, not you.|`|mkshF2Pfaa	Ha... You know, it's nice to see that parents are so supportive these days, particularly when their children are in times of need. What do you think this will accomplish? If you want a very potent distance between you and your future grandchild, I guess you've got that spot on.    You're not parenting- just the opposite. You're ignoring the situation, living in denial, and you can despise me for saying this all you want, but what do you want her to do? Not get pregnant? It's too late. So deal with the situation, make the best of it, and be the responsible adult- take care of your daughter when she needs you. If you don't, you were never fit to parent in the first place.|`|14pjwQPLaa	"Let me know when you are ready . . ."  Hello?  She had started having sex -- how much more READY did she have to be?!  Telling her to "keep her legs close" is a little like closing the barn door after the horse has run away.    If she's over 18, then you legally have no responsibility for her and she's going to have to figure this out herself, with or without you.  If she's under 18, then legally, you are still responsible for her.  If you can't have her in your home, you have to support her elsewhere.     I can understand why you are hurt, because she did something that you didn't agree with, and you feel like you are being asked to condone something that you strongly disagree with.  But you can either choose to cut your daughter out of your life forever, or figure out some way to get over your hurt feelings and keep some sort of relationship with her. Parents are often hurt when our children take paths different from what we would have chosen for them -- but ultimately, it is their path to walk.|`|m6gkEzkhaa	if you feel bad for that.. imagine how she feels...  if it feels right then she should have all rights..  at least its better then having a pregnant 15 or 16 year old..she has that sense doesnt she?  why do you feel hurt? you're the one who dumped her..this is when she needs your help the most and you let her down..in the worst way  at least she told you she was pregnant, expecting support and help  she didnt have to tell you but she did|`|10311365789606113f4eb728aaeb5c30aa	what your first mistake was is that u actually gave her permission to have sex. u said, let me know when you are ready ill take you to the doctors and get birthcontrol. that's a mistake. it makes it seem like its in theory okay for her to be having sex and even if u tell her to not to, if u tell her u will get her birth control u are basically promoting the fact that it is an option. your fault there.    if she is keeping the baby, u should be supporting her. u should have her grounded and have her under constant watch but what's done is done. they had sex. your daughter got pregnant. now deal with it. you're her mother. and even though she made possibly one of thee stupidest mistakes a teenager can make, it's up to the parent to help her until she turns 18 and is legally out of her hands. at 18 u can throw her out. under that, you shouldn't. just think of the child. i know if i had ever gotten pregnant under the age of 18 (or 19 or 20 or probably 21 and not married and still living with my parents) my parents would saayy that they would kick me out but once the deed is done, they would probably support me and either get me an abortion if i am under 18 or help me to deal with the consequences. a good parent wants whats best for their child AND their child's children. even if their children themselves are in fact still children. u have to help your daughter. u have every right to punish her but it honestly won't do anything really. the deed is done. now its time to think about the kid.    also, this matters alot too. how old is she? and is she still with her boyrfriend?    hope i helped :) good luck.|`|KL24imFBaa	you are a terrible mom. period. how would you feel if that were you? i hope she never forgives you. you were hurt> how about your unborn grandchild? to know that their mom was thrown out while pregnant? you need help|`|Jb9FsdrGaa	She made a mistake, but she is still your daughter and your responsibility...assuming she is under 18. Make her get a job to help pay for things, but don't completely cut her out. If you don't help her at all, your basically setting her up to fail. She cannot work enough to support a baby and get a good education at the same time. If you help her, chances are she will get a good enough education that she can get a nice job, and be able to support the baby herself one day. Maybe she can even pay you back!|`|yXmUmFJOaa	Since it is too late for birth control I wouldn't kick her out. Well since you did already I would have her come back home. You don't want your child running around the streets with a baby in her belly worrying sick about her. As upset as you are with her she is going to need your help. You need to help her become ready to become a parent. Don't dictate her life but offer your support. Take her to parenting classes, counseling, Start looking at day cares. Take her to the doctors. As much as you are upset with her you have to accept the fact that you both need to set that aside and think of that baby. Hope I could help and best of luck!|`|Jke03iFmaa	By kicking her out your distancing yourself from your daughter and grand-baby. Show her that you care for her, TALK! She'll need your help and will be willing to listen if you open up  to her.|`|H9iwiLBsaa	You are horrible if you think throwing your possibly pregnant teenage daughter out because you are too selfish to help her in her time of need. This just proves your definitely not a good parent because as a mom, you are supposed to love and care for your child, no matter what. The fact that you threw her out, makes me think u just dont want to have to pay for her and the baby. IF it was you, how woud you feel  if your mother threw you out? Look at this from her point of view. You didn t mean to get pregnant but you did. It was an accident. So are you going to be thrown out becaus you made a mistake? It's pathetic these days how horrible parenting has gotten. It's sad how you wont help your child that looked up to you only a short time ago. I may be only a young teenager, but I understand enough. And more than most people my age, and apparently more ethics than you. You need to get yourself in to gear go back to your daughter and GROVEL, and beg on ur knees for her to forgive you. Because that just shows, if you dont, that shes better off with otu you. She needs someone helpful and better than you, now more than ever.  |`|nKUyy2WLaa	You're disgusting.

DtN08e6gaa	Mongolian birthmarks, which are often on the butt, can be grayish.  They fade in time, generally by the second b-day.  They're common enough and totally benign, but no, not all babies have them.|`|DVceuScvaa	My son was the SAME way! It was dark gray- and when he was first born, I thought it was bruising from the birth? Lol. But it stayed, but faded with time.    He's 18 months now- and his gray butt is all gone. It didn't seem like it, probably from looking at it daily during diaper changes- but suddenly it was gone! Just hang in there a little longer!      Edit: I must've skipped over the light skin part- I didn't see it. My son is biracial- so he is light skinned too.|`|AA11155768	It will fade over time.

Take a picture for the baby book before it fades!|`|I3N26tAYaa	its probably just his birth mark|`|demzNLi7aa	I have never heard of that before in my life. I would talk to a pediatrician.. You won't find an answer on here most likely.|`|MH4kr3fJaa	not unless their alein.  haha jk not that i no of.
NQgz5F2Aaa	I have 2 that have been doing that lately - a 1 yr old and a 22 month old... I just started making sure that I put tighter underpants (from my older son) over their diapers/// the snap onsies help too - I hate teh way they look with cloths, but it makes it hard for teh babies to unsnap teh buttons to play with their poop|`|Al4c3Zgdaa	yes it happens.   Put her down to nap after she has pooped if possible and make sure she is in sleeper pjs or something that would be harder to get off.    I had friends who had to put sleepers on their twins backwards because of this yucky problem.   Good luck.|`|CmxJdPh2aa	i don't think this is necessarily means its time for potty training, just means she's curious and able to get in there. my son did this a couple times and he is just now potty trained, he's three. the poop play happened closer to 18 months, and i def. don't think he would have been ready to potty train then. you just have to make sure when you put her down that she can't get into her diaper and/or can't get it off.   not every kid does this, but its pretty "normal." there's nothing wrong with her, anyways, just one of the joys of babies. haha|`|npuavjABaa	lol aww how cute.  well sometimes its cute and sometimes its not lol.  my daughter does that but shes 15 months old.   i think shes very curious cuz my neice is almost 2 and shes enjoys playing with poop i dont know why its so funny but gross at the sametime.  try and teach her say noo dont touch its dirty. make it sound like its dirty. so she wont get sick.  and so she'll want to go to the toliet instead.|`|8iCTkmbIaa	IT is fine, i have the same problem with my 2 yr old too. He will sleep for about an hour, then wake up, pull his dipie (what he calls them) off and paints the wall, and his crib, AND his butt. and body and face.    The thing that works for me is, i pretend that he doesn't have anything on his face or body, and i get him a rag and a bucket of water, and i shut the door. The first time i did it, he looked at me like, what do i do??????? But the second time i took the rag, and i wiped the wall, then i stuck in the bucket, and wiped his boodie. (it was frozen water) and i left. He got it, and i checked on him every now and then...      BUt if that didn't work for you, i tried other things too one time i---    got a ice cold bucket of water, and i dumped it on his head, then i let him stand by the window and air dry. then he had to go and clean it up.|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	haha had it happen to me once....then it was potty training time.....or ur going to have to find an outfit that she isnt able to get off....lol isnt it gross when they do stuff like that!!!|`|en5e64Puaa	It means you need to start her potty training.  I've been told that once your baby starts taking off her diaper then they are ready to learn to potty train!!!    Good Luck!!!|`|TeLlekpdaa	My kids take theirs off sometimes too. I put it on backwards when they won't leave it on. Or put some clothes on her that are hard to get to the diaper with.|`|TmyTBCzeaa	well she dosent know yet so of course she will not know  better so of course it is normal|`|a7xhpJZiaa	we have to keep shorts on my 11 mo old son, when he hears the bath running he will try so hard to get it off     he loves to play with the velcro I wish they still made them sticky|`|AA11155768	This is a good indicator that your child is ready to start potty training. Usually the first clue is when your child wakes in the morning with a dry diaper.
C5ne8yKeaa	CIO or the Ferber method.  I rlly don't know what it's called. I googles it and everything! srry|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	My brother-in-law used to do this. After extensive test (30+ years ago) they discovered he had a blood disorder. Basically this disorder caused a lack of oxygen in the blood which caused him to pass out. He wouldn't always cry when it happened though..sometimes he would just stiffen up and freeze..then pass out. Call the doc for sure.|`|AA11155768	First, I'd speak to my doctor about it at the next visit to make sure there is nothing else wrong. Once she passes the doctor's inspection, it's time to work on how you discipline your child and teaching her more effective methods for expressing her feelings. Toddlers throw temper tantrums out of frustration and it's up to us parents to find an appropriate method for dealing with it without getting frustrated ourselves.    Good luck!|`|I3N26tAYaa	uhh crying urself to sleep?|`|Vw8GdpxLaa	My friend has a two year old that does the same thing. The doctor says that there is nothing wrong with her. She just crys so hard and so aggressively that her body just goes into over load and turns off.    FYI I am not sure that that is true I want her to get a second opinion but that's just me.    And no she does not let her scream like that without trying to console her. She just throws that big of a fit some days.|`|YPuVx2Niaa	I would call it passing out.  I would try to find ways to avoid letting her get to that point.  It isn't healthy for a child to cry that hard.|`|OhlX6eWaaa	I have no idea what that could be. If i would you, i would try to ask your doctor.|`|WyRfOHz4aa	I have never heard of this. Its called "call your doctor really quick because this is serious"|`|Bx6EkDCPaa	The Ferber Method...    Or some may call it Child Neglect!
5M8kRqQ8aa	I think you should see your OB within the next few days so he can check to see if your contractions are causing you to dialate more. I can tell you from experience that pregnancies with frequent, powerful contractions throughout go early. Two out of my three were this way. I gave birth at 29 weeks and 36 weeks. The 36 week pregnancy had the strongest and most frequent contractions.  If your OB says you're contractions are not causing you to dialate you can relax, but either way, stay off your feet and close to home.  My personal feeling is that you will go early, but no one can really know how much. Good luck.  Also, at 32 weeks already, your baby will be fine even if its born today. |`|ao4r5aPuaa	you should probably stay off your feet as much as you can.  you are 8 weeks from full term. this is considered a premature baby.  there can be complications, such as lung/breathing problems for the baby.  what is your doctor telling you???|`|vbqu3rBEaa	this is my first pregnancy and im almost 33 weeks. about two weeks ago i was having pressure and painless contractions. went to L&D and i was dehydrated. ive been drinking plenty of spring water and havent had any since that day after.|`|AA11155768	They sound like Braxton-Hicks contractions but you should really be calling your doctor if you haven't already. Doesn't sound like you'll make it to 40 weeks though.
5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	My son was about 4 when he totally stopped.  He would do "quiet time" every afternoon where he would fall asleep about half the time before that for about a year.    My daughter stopped about a month ago at 23 months old.  It's not because she doesn't need it, she's just very very aware that her brother isn't taking one and doesn't want to have to do anything her brother isn't doing (he's 5 now).  This leaves us with an extremely cranky toddler monster for about and hour before bed time each night.    I'm so envious of you, I miss that little break in the day during nap time.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	My youngest isn't quite 2 and I cut out naps about a month ago. She would stay up till midnight or later and wouldn't sleep past 6 am when she would nap. She has been an awful awful sleeper since the beginning, so anything to get her to sleep at night.   All my kids were done regular naps by the time they turned 2. I will deal with the crankiness at dinner time to ensure that everyone gets a proper nights sleep. |`|AA11155768	Children usually need naptime up until the age of 5 or 6. I've seen how grouchy they can get without one and I sympathize with you. I've included a link below which shows suggestions for the amount of naptime a child may need.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	I'm 58 and I still take naps.|`|zrBzRYI8aa	My little brother is 3 and just stopped a few months ago. Only because if he naps he wont go to bed at night time at all. |`|bd2affbfcb216a0067cbf336ceff00b3aa	They usually stop when they are around 5 years old. Some kids stop at 4. I have a child care center and...   4 year old class: 3 of 18 don't sleep at nap time. The 3 are all about to turn 5.  3 year old class: 1 of them stays up out of 15- He arrives late every monring  2 year old class- all 11 of them sleep.  1 year olds- all 6 of them sleep.  If they don't need the nap, they won't sleep.|`|mW2txXHOaa	My daughter is 5 and she stopped when she started school. But they still take power naps in school.|`|JsOhSwc2aa	I stopped around 3|`|e3WI73tfaa	My daughter will be 4 in Dec. She stopped taking naps at about 1 1/2. She usually sleeps 13 hours at night. Since she was very small we've been strict about getting her to bed at the same time every night, about 7:30 or so, and she wakes up in the morning at about 8:30 like clockwork. |`|R0bU1kMtaa	Napping is a wonderful thing at 3 years old.  My preschool class has 1 1/2 hour naps everyday and kindergarten has power naps.  At 3 they are growing and learning so much there little bodies still need a rest.|`|SBChwz88aa	All y children stopped when they went to school.  Mother of 4 & raising 2 granddaughters 23 & 7 months
t0peLI9zaa	My mother was weeing the bed until she was sixteen. I'm still going through it and I'm almostt fourteen! I try not to be ashamed, but it's so hard. I go to sleepovers, though. All the time! Most of my parties are sleepovers and nobody even notices that I wee the bed. Just wear Goodnights. They only go up to a certain size though, because apparently bed-wetting is common until you reach a certain age. If you're really skinny, you could get away with normal diapers that are less expensive but... I would go with good-nights or Depends, lol. Have fun and just wear baggy boxers or pants when you have a sleepover, they're hardlynoticeablee. what I do is I change when most of them are asleep and just pretend I'm getting up to go get a drink to eliminate ANY suspicions. You don't notice in the dark, anyways. I'm sorry if I'm rambling but I feel so much better that someone is out there asking the same questions I used to! There IS medication out there, but it didn't work for me. It might work for you, though. You just have to tell ANOTHER nosy pediatricion about your problem. But good luck, anyways. Please go to sleepovers, your problem shouldn't get in the way if you do the right things before-hand. (Just have a little bit of water when you're thirsty before going to bed, and wear some Goodnights for godsake!)  Hope I helped.  |`|5w5mJQoYaa	I'm not going to lie and say it is common but it's not unheard of. so don't go creeping yourself out and making yourself believe that you are the only one this has happened to!   About a year ago (when I was also 13) I went to a friends sleepover and even though i had no recent history of bed wetting i completely soaked the mattress with urine and it stank!   The biggest thing was how embarrassed I was But i explained to my friend how much it shocked me and she hasn't told anyone and she really comforted me at the time (and of course borrowed me a pair of knickers!)   You will probably start to feel really depressed that you feel that you are unable to go on sleepovers or trips away but look on the bright side hopefully this wont last Forever and when it stops (fingers crossed) everything will be fine.    i would suggest going to your doctor though as I am sure she/he would be more than happy to prescribe some drugs that may help you to end this problem once and for all!   There are many options available for you and you should really start trying them as soon as possible because you seem to be missing out on a lot as you cannot experience as many things as children 'our' age can. So i would definitely recommend making an appointment as soon a possible ( you may be embarrassed- but getting rid of the problem now is the best was forward! |`|UgZq1pXjaa	It does suck if you let it get to you.  I was one like Silly_Girl and wet the bed for a very long time, even longer that her.  I was also one of the skinny ones able to wear regular diapers and was diapered for a very long time until I stopped.  But then and even now when I look back, I would much rather wake up in a wet diaper at age 16 than a wet bed.  There are so many people out there that wet the bed and of course its something that no one talks about.  I did a research paper in college, the diaper manufacturers make just as many adult diapers as they do baby diapers in all types of sizes and kinds, from tape tab diapers to pull-on diapers like the goodnites.  The need for adult diapers is actually growing faster than the needs of baby diapers.  Pampers has already made one new larger size seven diaper and in my opinion in the up coming years you will see as size 8, 9, and probably a size 10 diaper.  Its something that used to be the OMG keep it hush hush but its happens to more people than you think and more common these days.  Too many people make a bid deal of older kids wearing a diaper when all a diaper is plastic underwear to protect the bedding.  No big deal.  |`|tFjBztJwaa	my mom wet the bed til she was 14   it happens, you just gotta control it|`|db02bcc2eeac2a1b17eed769a65dd718aa	not common but there r some people who do it  try this  when u go pee go hard then stop all of a suddon for lke 5 seconds do this often it helps make blader stronger|`|hWSzVMZMaa	Not common...just don't drink a lot before you sleep. |`|PHVDwHfSaa	im not sure... are you ejaculating?|`|HQHO7RlCaa	well maybe because you masterbate too much, so insted of masterbating at night try early time and thats what happen to my son|`|Osn1xpu6aa	not it's not common.  Don't drink anything before you go to bed, and try to pee before you sleep.|`|3YJRqFGJaa	its not common but it happens dont drink anything before u go to bed like dont drink anything at least an hour before u go to bed and go to the bathroom rite before u go to bed |`|Q87djE0laa	i remember i was asleep on my mums chair and i was dreaming i was having a wee in the woods next minute i woke to find i was actually weeing and my mum and sis was in the room oops. dont have anything to drink 2 hours before you go to sleep and go to the toilet before you go bed |`|JsqMSU9Haa	check with dr, i think there is medication to help you with that|`|by7H31Djaa	That is not common. So you really need to get advice from a doctor maybe see if you can take something for awhile until you get older. I dont wet the bed but i have to pee way too many times than the normal which sadly keeps me from drinking water Lol|`|nkZdtXXhaa	Look, it still happens to me like once a year and I'm not too much older than you.  You'll eventually outgrow it.  Just be extra careful about drinking water and going to the bathroom like A MILLION TIMES before you go to sleep.  If you find yourself at a sleepover and you've wet the bed, go get a glass of mountain dew and spill it over whatever gets wet.  Then, place the glass on your sleeping bag, as if you kicked it over, and go back to sleep.  When you wake up, they'll think you kicked over a mountain dew and they won't mock you quite as much for it.    Seriously, it will get better with time hon'.  Good luck.|`|ACR40sTCaa	no it is not, if you want to go to a sleepover, buy some diapers to be safe, and use those. dont drink a lot before bed either|`|FrvvvzuKaa	It could be the fact that you have a bladder problem. I have a small bladder and often pee every hour. If you control the amount of liquids you consume it should get better. |`|s8nX1kXPaa	It's not very common, but some people do it. What you can do to help is wear Goodnites (absorbent underwear designed for kids that wet the bed), don't drink anything before you go to bed, and try to pee before you go to sleep as well. Even if you're not sure that you have to go, still try. Make sure that your bladder is empty before you go to sleep. If you wake up in the middle of the night, go pee. Bedwetting happens to both young and old people, so don't be ashamed of it. You might also want to invest in a waterproof plastic cover for your mattress.|`|zgooUZ1zaa	This could be common but it also could be the sign of a problem.  There are some steps that you can take to not wet the bed such as do not drink anything 2 hours before bed.  Also make sure that during the day you drink plenty of fluids in order to empty your bladder.  Also if the bed wetting continues maybe consult your family physician to make sure that you don't have a problem with your bladder or to make sure that you don't have a problem with night terrors or anything like that.|`|AA11155768	There are LOTS of people who have this problem. My niece just turned 15 and just recently stopped wetting the bed. I hope your parents have spoken to a doctor about it. If they haven't, they should.     People who tell you it's not common or to just stop drinking before going to bed have never heard of it and don't know what they are talking about.     You can use pull ups or adult diapers. Just remember, you have nothing to be ashamed of and it's not your fault. You WILL outgrow it!    Definition  Enuresis, or bedwetting, is a very common problem in children and teenagers the world  over. It is estimated that enuresis occurs among  10% of 6-year-olds  3% of 12-year-olds  1% of 18-year-olds    Good luck!!

jlrb0ZXoaa	i think there is significant information saying that natural mothers milk is healthier than formula. unless youre a drug user of course. research it and give him the facts.|`|44OH7Si6aa	You tell him that's fine, he can choose not to breast feed the child but you have decided you will be. It isn't his decision, it's not his breasts. If you want ask your doctor for some pamphlets on the benefits of breast feeding and give those to your boyfriend or you can print articles out for him    http://www.womanshealth.gov/breastfeedin...  http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/895_brs...  http://www.usbreastfeeding.org/Issue-Pap...  http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-breastfe...|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You do it anyway and say "This is my body and my baby." Just because his daughter wasn't breastfed should have nothing to do with this child. If he's going to be that immature and controlling about it, then he might not be worth being around. Sorry!    It's not really his decision. And he can still feed the baby - just pump into a bottle. It's your decision, and if you want to, do it. To heck with what he says!|`|i8Ch743Laa	You just tell him you're going to do it. It's your decision,not just his. It's a mutual thing,I think it's better for the baby,or maybe show him some information where it even SAYS it's better. I just won't do it because I'm uncomfortable with it.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	Realistically, it's your choice, not his.  It should never be his decision on whether or not you breastfeed your child.  Other than the fact that his daughter wasn't breastfed, what is his reason against it?  Does he even have one?  The best advice I can give is to stand your ground, explain the reasons why its best to breastfeed, why you want to do it, and don't back down.  Do listen to his reason, but honestly, you should do what you feel is right for your children.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	What is his problem?|`|OBn4a7rzaa	tell him your breast feeding and thats it.

I mean come on what is he thinking does he know how much money that will keep in his pocket book, not to mention how much better it is for his child. I guess bring him to a breast feeding class cause he sounds ignorant about the matter.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Tell him he's out of luck, and hand him pamphlet upon pamphlet about the benefits of breast feeding, for both you and your child. If he still doesn't go for it, have you talked about expressing and then giving breast milk in a bottle?     If he's completely not budging on it, tell him to suck it up, and breast feed anyway.|`|cEXzXkqnaa	You just do it...it is not his choice. It is what is best for the baby...Show him online research about how it is waaaaaaaaay better than formula|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	That is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard of !    your child should be denied the benefits of breastfeeding because his daughter wasnt ???   Sounds a bit controling to me.    what do you mean he WONT let you ?     How can he stop you is my question ???    Since when is your boyfriend in charge of you ?|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	I dont see how he can stop you..|`|NrOJ24hSaa	Breastmilk is by far the best for your child and even though I'm sure his daughter turned out fine you should always do the best that you possibly can. Go online and research the benefits of breastfeeding (trust me, there are PLENTY) and show the information to him. Hell, even show him a can of formula and right on there will be a label that says "Breastmilk is always best" or something to that extent. If he still doesn't agree, have him talk to your doctor (or even better an expert in lactation). If nothing works, remind him of the hundreds (maybe thousands) of dollars you two would save by not buying formula. If he doesn't give in, I would just do it anyway. Whats best for your baby is whats best for your baby and that is that. Good luck :)|`|zATQaiwIaa	Even though you guys are a couple it is ultimately your choice - buy him a book or if he needs it simple > print out a bullet type list of all the benefits of breastfeeding.  He is more than likely just very uncomfortable with the whole thing.|`|tYETR23Xaa	how can he stop you?|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Tell him it's your body and you'll do what you want.  His daughter wasn't, but all THREE of yours were.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Too bad for him! What is he going to do about it if you decide to breastfeed!? lol  You can always compromise and pump your milk to feed the baby. However if you're adamant on breastfeeding because of the bonding with your baby, than your boyfriend is out of luck.|`|6a5558f10437d4175355a4810795a8a6aa	well, first of all its free.  second, its your child and your breasts.  he shouldnt have a choice.|`|PfIywLLyaa	Um, I think that is your decision, and there isn't any ring on your finger, and that is probably what I would tell him as well. Do what you want. When he starts giving birth, he can make the decision!|`|goNi28Eraa	Tell him about all the benefits of breastfeeding.  Also, the biggest plus I find with breast feeding is the fact that it is FREE!  Formula is so expensive!  Think of all the money you can save by feeding the baby the way God intended!
SHEjVIrUaa	yeah you can get pregnant without having full intercourse. happened to my friend.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Unless you have been told by an Angel, that will give birth to the Son of God.  Yes, that is a basic requirment.|`|0LHw7Ve5aa	Penetration doesn't have to occur, but it's pretty rare to get pregnant without it  If the guy ejaculates near the vagina then semen can get into it and therefore pregnancy can occur  Hope I helped :)    EDIT - before a guy actually cums, semen still does leak out a bit, and so you could get pregnant from that as well as when he actually orgasms|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	No there is artifical insemination and even if the guy cums down there there is a possibility you can get pregnant its a slim chance though|`|2BEMSGPdaa	It has happened in the past. 2009 years ago.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	To get pregnant sperm needs to meet an egg. If you have a man put his penis inside you even just for a second and he releases any precum then you can still get pregnant off of that, but it is still considered having sex, just not finishing. Also you can have a man ejaculate right next to your vagina and sometimes the sperm can find it's way inside and get you pregnant. That is very rare, but it can happen.|`|3Z9nQIaoaa	Of course not. We as human beings are not asexual creatures. If we were then we would have no use for men and the male gender would have all died out and females would rule the world. But since we are sexual creatures we must have the male to fertilize the egg in order for use to reproduce.     What you have read lied to you and please spell you correctly.|`|7xit1ogxaa	All that needs to happen is for penetration to occur. Once penetration occurs it is considered sex, it doesn't matter if it lasts for only 30 seconds or 30 minutes. It only takes one sperm to become pregnant.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	if semen gets near your vagina there is a small chance it will enter you and you will get pregnant. I havent ever heard of a real life case where this happened, but everyone says it can.|`|juraRlbkaa	Nope, you can just hold someone else's and BAM, you're pregnant.|`|AA11660242	No. There is such a thing as artificial insemenation.|`|cEXzXkqnaa	If sperm somehow gets into the vagina, you can get pregnant. And i guess you don't need to have sex to make that happen. But you would have to deliberately place sperm in there for it to happen...|`|ZC4YGzrQaa	You could get donated sperm. Girls get pregnant when sperm go into an egg in the girl's body. Unless sperm is tranmitted into the egg, you can't get pregnant.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	yes, if he rubs it around that area some sperm can travel to your cervix.  i would just keep it away if you don't want to use a condom.  you should always use a condom unless you are in a commited relationship.  he can get you pregnant without having an orgasm.|`|6rRZGKxoaa	in most cases, but you can have a (what i call) a tube baby like this person did : http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090131/ap_o...|`|hvvzalAeaa	no -- but it is soooooo rare..|`|wGTxHpjvaa	Yes you have to have sex to get pregnant~ You have to have sperm and egg!|`|4IBR4Bh4aa	There's only one way to find out...|`|YseGAHIfaa	sperm has to enter ur vagina someway.. not necessary via intercourse.. no|`|8f23a4206101dec944da03ad28d56bc5aa	Fooling around and even pre-*** has sperm in it and CAN get a girl prego.  Doctor told me this when I went for some birth control when I first got married.
fV6ChBxmaa	Well being that you haven't really given much to go off of, I'd say discharging is normal, especially as the pregnancy goes on.  Some women get it bad through out, but pretty much all women get discharge towards the end.  You have to remember that pregnancy is all about changing hormones, and that in turn causes discharge.  As you get further along, the discharge will get thicker as internal ways begin to prep for child birth. But being that you didn't say anything about your specifics, you can always ask your doctor. If your shy to talk about it face to face, call a nursing line as ask over the phone.  Then you don't even have to give your name.
AMyZvgcVaa	Have her take a At-home pregnancy test! Good for you for being the responsible man and marry her! My boyfriend didn't do that to me!|`|EXhVHMAlaa	The chances of her getting signs like this so early is highly unlikely.    Increased urination usually doesn't occur until later in the pregnancy when the baby starts pushing against the bladder.  Morning sickness wouldn't occur this early either.    Take a test to be sure.  Be safer next time.  God bless.|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	First of all you should take a test to confirm whether she is pregnant or not and then I guess you will need to tell your parents. Just remember that as long as you are both going to stick by each other then everything will work out ok. I'm sure your parents will be supportive in the end, it may take them a little persuading tho!     All the best xx|`|4a13445dac8b2d3af3c8f0b2efe782adaa	Well i think you sound like a very mature young man. Try and sit down with them after the positive test of coarse and start by saying you know what you have to do,  and say "if you guys dont want to support me right now its okay i just wanted you to know what is happening" They will realize hopefully you are being a responsible man and taking control of the situation. Tell them you are getting a good job and doing what you have to do to take care of your child. and also what you may want to do is give them praise and say i know what i should do because i had the best teachers... lol try it all|`|o0wHfmUzaa	well honestly i don't think you should marry your gf unless you r Absolutely in love because the result of being married for the child is that the relationship will NOT last long because there is no love
AA10080206	a child will come out of you|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Take a pregnancy test!|`|pwC0bEmHaa	u don't need to tell after 3 months ur stomoch will tell u|`|qN5iVvAFaa	there are always signs... your body should tell you, if not, Take a Test!!!|`|pIBOSkfsaa	Some symptoms may include.  morning sickness, emotional, urinating frequently, and sore breasts. But even if you have all these symptoms the main thing is not getting your period,  get a pregnancy test if you have missed you period, they are highly recommended and very accurate.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	if you are old enough to be having sex, then you should know that you normally dont get a period if you are pregnant.|`|dg6wd8ufaa	pregnancy test!|`|yXiyhD9zaa	u may feel nausiated ur breast will get a bit bigger or sensitive. Ur more tired and moody than usual. An at home pregnancy test is very accurate.|`|FoH5cY0Raa	missed period?    nausea?     sore or swollen breasts?
PFO1jxZGaa	all babies stop eating so much at around one. They are self regulating their eating and at that point their growing is slowing down considerably. If he continued to eat as before he would be really fat soon. I mean they more than double their birthweight in the first year, if they kept doing that you would have 80 lbs three year old :)   Its perfectly normal. Just give him all varieties of food and he'll be just fine and he will go thru growth spurts when he will chow down enormous amounts of food|`|JP2h62qiaa	why don't you put a couple of tater tots down on the tray and see if he will go for those. He is probably over baby foods or anything runny/mushy. He wants variety mom. Make sure you are only giving him about 4 ounces of formula or if you are weening to whole milk then 4 ounces of that in a cup with some food.  My son loves fish sticks. I would give it a try.        It could also be his teeth coming in too.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	Maybe he is full from formula and juice|`|okp0CMc3aa	he probably wants more grownup food, feed him whatever your eating, when your eating it.
52bAHCaUaa	I was terrified!     My daughter was born 3 months early, and spent 91 days in the NICU. So going home, from having all this help and basically everyone telling me what I could and couldn't do with her, such as feeding her and changing her(clothes) it was so different! I absolutely love it now that she is home of course, but it so different!     I haven't really had any experience, my sister is 9 years younger than me, and I'm 21 now, so that didn't help me out a whole lot. I think for the most part we just watched her sleep and wondered if we could actually feed her when we wanted!!|`|7gde2DRraa	Strange...he wasn't due until mid January and he was born on Nov 5th.  After 5 weeks in the NICU he came home.  It was nice but it just felt so unreal!  I was surprisingly not as nervous as I thought I would be.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	It was difficult. I was sleep deprived as I hadn't slept before my labour, nor did I overnight. I struggled with breastfeeding, couldn't bend over cos i'd had an epidural.... so no it wasn't what i'd expected.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I had absolutely no experience with babies. I wouldn't even hold other people's babies. Just didn't care for them much.    When I brought my son home, I set his carseat on the floor because he was sleeping. I stared at him while my husband set up the portable crib we were going to use for when the baby was downstairs. My husband finished setting that up, gave me a kiss and took off to pick up his first son. He had to drive a ways and wouldn't be back for 2 hours.    I stared at my kid until he woke up and made the little fish movements with his mouth like he was hungry. I carefully removed him from his seat and carried him to the bedroom to nurse. I laid there staring at him while he nursed and just couldn't believe he was mine. I was just in shock. He fell back asleep while nursing and I was still laying there staring at him when my husband and stepson got home.    I don't remember much else about that day, just being tired and in pain from the c-section scar. We took some pictures of my stepson with his new brother. That's all I remember.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	It was stressful. I had an emergency c-section and hadn't planned on recovering from major abdominal surgery and taking care of a newborn. Things got better day by day, but that first night was pretty rocky. Although, now that I look back on it, it was easy by comparison! Good luck!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Everything was fine, He slept and ate all day and got diaper changes...that was about it.|`|HvALvdc7aa	My 1st day home from the hospital my mom and husband were with me so I had alot of help. My 1st day home alone with her went fine. She did nothing but eat and sleep. Don't worry, your maternal instinct will take over. Its pretty amazing .|`|vsFJZRkGaa	i hadn't expected to come home to a messy house and a half painted cot!!  lol  so i got to work cleaning up the place and painting his cot while my husband went to work.  i was surprised by how much my baby slept - i had to wake him for each feed for a fortnight. and how energetic i felt.  yes, it all came naturally without any problems :)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Hmmm if I remember correcty I ogled my little girl, fed her, ogled her some more, changed her diaper, more ogling, put her down to nap (most likely under the watch of my ogley eyes) and maybe did a few chores like cooking and dishes.|`|XYvOg5Juaa	I must say I too was anxious about how would I manage with the baby after I get back home. I thought that the hospital staff is well trained and if you need help, they are always there by your side.  At Home, how would I get the same treatment?    But I admit, It all went just fine. I had a cesarean and could not get out of the bed easily. My Mom was at home to help me and I am thankful to her for doing the cooking and cleaning. But you can cook in advance and keep the food in the freezer.      Surprisingly my baby and I slept really well at home. The sleep was much better than the hospital and we both felt quite relax and refreshed. The recovery was better at home. I was mostly at home for 40days and didnt do much housework. I was feeding the baby and bathing the baby.     I am sure you too will be alright. SO DONT WORRY  and YES!! THINGS COME NATURALLY    Good luck|`|RmFVYkxeaa	It was scary!!! I had NO experience with babies, and things DID NOT come naturally. It's very much a learn on the job, job. But seriously, in about a week I had the hang of it and got into a rhythm. I was scared to pick him up because I had no idea how to do it! I even buzzed the nurse button in hospital and got them to come pick him up and hand him to me (silly, I know). At least she told me off (I was only 21 at the time) and then nicely showed me how to pick him up a few different ways. The nappy changing - after a few days you'll be a pro! The feeding, if you're breastfeeding it'll take about a month until your supply settles down and attachement is fully established and the sore nipples are gone - then it's easy street, especially when it comes to night feeding. I couldn't imagine how stressful it must be letting your baby scream while ypu make up and heat up a bottle. My babies woke up, I picked them up, lay down in bed with them and fed them straight away, they'd feed until they were done and would fall straight back to sleep! It was also stressful figuring out if they're too hot or too cold, another blanket? or take one off? but you'll figure it out : )|`|DLDweOcYaa	I had my baby at 12:51am on a Wednesday morning.  I went home that afternoon around 4:30pm.  The night was the hardest and longest night of my life.  My baby wasn't breastfeeding properly so she was screaming because she was hungry.  I had to express milk into a syringe which took me ages to do!  I ended up laying on the couch all night with my baby laying on my chest.  Needless to say I was very, very tired by the next morning.  It did get better though.|`|RoEyFm5yaa	MAGIC! LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.WAS LUCKY THAT IT ALL CAME SO NATURALLY.I WAS BLESSED WITH A VERY WELL BEHAVED BABY WHO WOKE UP EXACTLY EVERY 4 HOURS TO BE FED,CHANGED AND PUT BACK TO SLEEP.SHE WAS AMAZING BUT IS NOW MAKING UP FOR IT AS A TEENAGER! IF YOU ARE JUST HOME WITH NEWBORN THEN HOPE IT'S GOING WELL AND IF THINGS AREN'T COMING NATURALLY,IT MIGHT JUST TAKE A BIT OF TIME.GOOD LUCK.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I was very nervous.  My bf got called into work because they had a last-minute shift change and everyone else refused to take the shift so he only had time to take us home and then he had to run out the door to go to work for a few hours. So here I was sitting at home with my first baby while he was at work trying to convince someone to take the shift for him so he could come back home!  He wound up only being gone for about an hour and a half but I was pretty nervous being alone with her that soon lol  But overall, that hour and a half actually wasn't as bad as i was expecting. She slept for most of it, raised a bit of a fuss when she got hungry and then she was fine after she ate.|`|uCLenopbaa	the first day wasnt to bad, things did come naturaly. baby slept a lot, but woke up often.  the second day was worse, all i remember was falling asleep breastfeeding waking up to my baby kicking because he could hardley breathe. it was so horrible.. the third day go even worse. i was majorly sleep deprived and over emotional. i couldnt fall asleep because i was so tired i was worried that i wouldnt hear the baby cry.  his dad took two weeks off.. so that was helpful.. but he slept alot, and didnt help me as much as i expected. i was doing almost everything on my own.|`|ed72c617bb10153eb98393db9edf6b5aaa	I was anxious and I felt this rush of energy that I cleaned everything so that she wasn't breathing in any bad germs..even though I cleaned prior going to the hospital|`|AwvWBROlaa	It was nothing like i expected... baby wasnt too cute as i thought... hahahhaa newborns are not that cute...  but sooo precious... i was extremely overwhelmed. It was a brand new life i had to take full responsibility for long time..  Baby was crying constantly but all she needed was to be held... when i held her in my arms she stopped crying.. then i knew that this life needed me more than anything... its a good feeling =)  I had no idea how to raise a baby! i didnt even know diaper sizes, how to make milk, bath and just about everything.. i did alot of research online for the most part and other things just came within time.. i think nothing about raising a baby naturally comes.. even if you think its the right thing to do you will always have doubts and worries that you might be doing it wrong.|`|MQ34YW28aa	It was wonderful having him home. 1st baby too. Had my husband and my mom was down helping us also. I had a csection so it was hard for me to really help with him, which made me sad :(  I wanted to change his diapers and be able to feed him comfortably and I couldn't. But it was still great to have him home, i was waiting for sooo long to meet him and see what he looked like and he sounded like. And yes everything comes totally nautral to you, it's weird. lol
pwu9xzF8aa	i fell pregnant within the first week after my miscarriage. i am now 4 months pregnant. my doc told me it was better to wait, but beautiful to try straight away- so i did.  it is "better" 4 your body 2 wait, but the desire to have a baby can greatly outweigh that!! i wouldnt have gotten over my mc until i was pregnant again!  good luck!!|`|UxG6CkU2aa	It is very likely, especially after a D&C. Because the lining of the uterus is in perfect condition for a fertilized egg to stick to.  Sorry about your loss, I have had 2 m/c's and was able to get pregnant very quickly after both.|`|26A1Q3eqaa	its crazy you need to let your body experience at least one normal period after a m/c i had one in october and am 8 weeks now i had 2 normal periods if you ask a doctor they will tell you the same, good luck just be patient
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	No, your fine. Good Luck!|`|780ByZVEaa	nope|`|jNYEi0CTaa	Uh...no? Not unless it has toxic chemicals, but then I hope you wouldnt be putting it on your face if it did.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	no no no.  i use creams on my face and i use body lotion and body sprays like crazy.    don't worry too much you can't do everything perfect while pregnant and nobody expects you to either.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	no hun cream has nothin to do with affecting the baby youll be perfect fine and unless its had a scent that cant be used around pregnancy but other wise than thattt ur fine|`|GZrR0uxjaa	nope i use them right now, talk to your doctor is you have any concerns, some acne medication could possibly be harmful in the first trimester of pregnancy...good luck!|`|gga2mwFIaa	No youll be fine.
Jswomud7aa	Totally, Congrats!|`|4lpJRXYsaa	yes very normal|`|t8HPCzrOaa	yea this is all normal in pregnancy dont worry ull be fine congratss|`|vKvNDPbDaa	yes, this is all normal.  soon the nausea will start so enjoy your eating now.|`|kUuVFkZiaa	Absolutely, I have the same symptoms and I am 8 weeks pregnant. Except I don't have much of a appetite. Congratulations! Hope the best!|`|4P25mrF1aa	Yes very normal.
HclKftzAaa	ahahaha    I was TTC for 2 yrs. We were about to start clomid treatment. When the provera didn't start my period after 2 weeks, i took a HPT. it was positive! ZOMG! Then i took another one that arvo- it was pos! (Which i was amazed at, cause you know first morning pee and all that). then i took another one the next morning- it was positive too! Then i had a blood test on the monday and got the results on the tuesday. Positive!    I insisted on a dating scan- and sure enough, there was my little squishy, with their egg sack, all snug and cosy in my womb. *teary*    I am now 31 weeks pregnant- and some days i STILL can't believe it! lol. I get a big kick from squishy and think 'oh yeah, there's a baby in there!'    So no, you're not the only one to worry that someone will jump out from behind a curtain and shout 'hahaha! got you! you're not really pregnant!!!!' (candid camera style).    Even though i know it wasn't enough to convince me i am going to tell you that with 4 BFPs, i'm pretty gosh darn sure that you're pregnant!    GRATZ!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	If the clinic did a blood pregnancy test then you can rest easy that you're pregnant.|`|85vDqn6naa	No i was worried about the negative being wrong, LOL, don't worry sweetie you are prego, come on get happy!!!!!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I think you have nothing to worry about    I tested a few times cos i thought the tests were wrong - i didn't fully believe i was pregnant till my blood work came back!!     Congrats|`|HGDVgyJTaa	I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure the odds of 4 hpt's and the one at the clinic being wrong are slim.|`|gga2mwFIaa	Dont stress as of right now you are pregnant but the more you stress the higher your chances of going through a miscarriage. I am going through one now at 10wks and I wouldn't wish it on my worse enemy. Relax and take care of yourself you have a blessing inside you cherish it and be happy. Congratulations!!
qH3pVH7Paa	maybe for the first few months but obviously not later on. maybe u might wanna be a bit careful though i wouldn't cus the 1st few months you have to be the most careful.
RPszYGXkaa	Congratulations on your little girl!!!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	So what is the question, congratulations on your girl.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Congrats!|`|HPRlEWu1aa	awww! congrats!!!!!!   that gives me hope lol ... im going in for an u/s at 15w5d .. im hoping they will be able to tell me|`|AA11764194	I came to know I am having boy during my 13th week US.. so it is possible    Congrats.. enjoy your pregnancy and little girl|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Cool, they will also do a US at 20 weeks and then they will confirm it for you again too.  Congrats!|`|97e755fe7f3c18b6cabd7abbcfa7ba43aa	LUCKY! I am 14 weeks and they will not even do an ultrasound until 20 weeks to determine the gender! I am so excited, but wish I could know NOW!!   Congrats!|`|uiRdhx3saa	awww. congratulations. you're so lucky. i'm 18 weeks and went for an ultrasound on monday and couldn't even find out because baby sat indian style the whole time.|`|AA11823077	At 12 weeks your baby has defined sex organs.  Most of the time they are too small for the U/S tech to tell for 100% sure.  I suppose you could get lucky and find out if the baby was in the correct position.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Congrats!!!|`|4X7miUCaaa	Congrats, any names picked out yet? first baby?|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	I did a thing when I was pregnant with my daughter and it came back correct. I can't remember what company that I used put they were correct on the gender of my child. I think that i was about 13 weeks thought when I found out. But anyhow... Congrats on your up and coming baby daughter!
8XjJzj7Naa	It doesnt sound like pregnancy, maybe an infection such as UTI. Pregnancy tests vary anywhere from $1.00-$20.00 it all depends on where you purchase them. I highly doubt you would feel symptoms already from sex that occured just last night, but theres always that chance.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Depends...name brand ones cost a bit more but you can get one for free at planned parenthood or some dollar stores sell them and they are just as good.|`|3Ncriah6aa	first of all if you had unprotected sex last night you will not know if your pregnant for about 2 weeks you are most likely feeling naseus from something else. and it depends on what you buy i got ept 3 pack and it cost i think around 20 dollars|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	You can get $1 tests at the Dollar General, but if you just had sex it will not show up yet.  Wait till your period is late.  Other tests run from $7 up into the $20s|`|pwu9xzF8aa	a pregnancy test would be useless to u right now.  You could have a UTI, or something else going on down there- if u r having sex and hurt when u pee, u should see a doctor to rule out any STD's.  Or maybe you were just too rough??  use protection- its protects u from a lot more than just babies!|`|bSZK2tVtaa	There at Walgreen's or walmart and the dollar store they are all different prices some up to 25 dollar. Also if you were pregnant you wouldn't be feeling the symptoms  that early if you just had sex last night.    Good luck     Sara|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	It would be too soon to found out if you are pregnant and it happened last night.  If it hurts when you pee you may have a uti.  You should go and see your doctor.  But if you do want to take a pregnancy test you can go to a dollar store or Walgreen's and pay between $1 and $15.|`|p3d3E75oaa	from 1 dollar to 30 but if you just had sex last night don't bother|`|Uy8ntukjaa	They usually cost about $17 but you can get a free one at your local Planned Parenthood. It won't show a pregnancy until at least 7 days after your missed period however so you're going to have to wait it out.|`|DNygQdmVaa	first off if you just had sex last night a test wouldn tell you weather youre pregnant or not, its way too soon.  and 2nd you wouldn be having symtoms already.    symptoms start around 7 weeks, and you can test in about 3 weeks.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Uh yeah.  Why didn't you use a condom - I know, I know, stupid question.  But I think condoms are given out at clinics for free whereas pregnancy tests aren't always free...  but if you go to a special "free" health clinic you might be given a test for free.  The dollar store sells them for a dollar but it won't work until about 2-3 weeks from now.  Meanwhile, look up the symptoms and self-diagnose yourself.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	you wouldnt have symptoms this fast.. it my be a urinary tract infection but tests are usually 7 dollars, but they are a dollar at a dollar store|`|gga2mwFIaa	They usually range from 5-20 dollars depending on which one you choose. You can also get them for a dollar from the dollar store they keep them behind the counter and they have worked just as well as the more expensive ones.|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	If you have a medical card then you can go to your local health department and pay only a dollar or two or it maybe free. But if you dont have a medical card I do believe that you still can go without having one. But the price wise I would have no ideal how much that they would charge you. You can also try dollar stores. I think I paid like 3 or 4 dollars for mine. And it was a cheap verision of the pregnancy test and it worked just perfectly fine. But if you are willing to pay more than there are some expensive ones at Wal-Mart. Hope this helps.|`|3BhPab1Oaa	if it was last night a pregnancy test wont be effective until a missed period|`|VESdMODnaa	If you had sex lastnight you would not be feeling the effects of pregnancy yet. Painful urination isn't even a symptom of pregnancy, that sounds like a Urinary Tract Infection. Although with the nausea it sounds like it could be an STD.|`|G7EUr6kCaa	They cost about 9 bucks for 2, they usually come in packs instead of single. You could also go to your local health department or planned parenthood for free, i would recommend the second because it actually sounds like you may have a uti or an std. Hope this helps!|`|ZaFhP9Uiaa	You would not be experiencing any symptoms the very next day after having inter course...its way way to early!!!    If it hurts to pee then you may have a bladder infection which can also cause nautia!    You can get pregnancy tests from some dollar stores.  I would make an appt with your doctor though to see if you have a Urinary Tract Infection!  That sounds more likley that that is what it is and anti biotics will help that.      Dont worry, UTI's or Bladder infections are very common in girls.  They are not caused so much by just having sex.  The wrong soaps or a bath can also bring them on!  No big deal!|`|eA93MJj4aa	Impossible to be feeling symptoms now. TOOO EARLY. They cost como $9-$25|`|gBEq0zo5aa	A pregnancy test doesn't work until you miss a period ( or a day or two before) there is no way you could possibly know you are pregnant right now. It even takes a few days for the sperm and egg to meet and for the fertilized egg to implant in the uterus. If you do miss a period, then take a pregnancy test (about 2-3 weeks from now). They cost anywhere from 5-17 dollars depending on brand.|`|dxTwHB1yaa	You wouldn't be pregnant already...or at least pregnant enough to warrant symptoms.     And you can get them at the dollar store...it's anywhere from a buck there to $17.00 at Wal-Mart or a grocery store.|`|jTAWyIzqaa	Aint you in luck. I've been trying for a while, so I've been a POAS (pee on a stick) pro for a while now. But to help answer you they are usually 7 or 8 bucks. You can get the cheaper brands such as Equate or the dollar store brand. They register the same hormone your body produces when you concieve. EPT or First Response, I found a 3 pack of them for $15at Wally World. But I would probably wait till I missed a period till I checked, just to be sure. It helps to by the multiple packs. By the sound of your question, your pretty desparate to find out so you'll end up needing more than one. Hope this has helped some. Good Luck!
AA11661606	I'm 30 wks too! So far I have a couple stuff that I bought because they were really cute and I couldn't help myself. But I'm waiting for the baby shower. That way after the gifts I can see what else I need. If you already had a baby shower I would check to see what else there is left to buy.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	By the time i was 30 weeks i had almost everythin bought and ready for my son, i like being prepared, Hope this helps, :D.|`|bK5f2p38aa	I have nothing but the car seat, the day that my girl is born, daddy and big brother (28 months old) will go shopping, LOL! and then we'll go all together...
8z03BV5Saa	Hi. I am actually pregnant right now with twins. And my parents weren't teens when they had my sisters and I. I don't think the statistics are true. It's just all these judgmental people who make up stuff.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	My mom got pregnant with me at 19...and had me at 20..  And i got pregnant at 14..and had them at 15..|`|L1zHF8HXaa	my mother had me at age 27, and i am sixteen years old and i am pregnant, its nothing to do with your parents, it has to do how you were raised/morals, the way i was raised was alot different than how my mother was raised.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	my mom had me at age 30, i had a child at age 19. i'm sure if a mother had her daughter at age 15, she may feel like she cant control what her daughter does when she hits that age so she just lets whatever happens happen.  my mom was pretty strict with me but i still became a teenage mother. it depends on the person.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	ya it really has nothing to do with it. my mom had me at 17 and i'm pregnant and i'm 21, young yes but a decent age to have a baby wouldn't u say? if anything it was knowing that my mom was super irresponsible that kept me from doing the same thing, i mean i didnt even lose my virginity till i was 18. so **** those statistics. it's like the ones saying that children of single parent homes are more likely to become prostitutes or drug addicts i hate stupid assumptions like blaming parents for your choices. u know when something happens to you that it was your decision, blaming it on numbers is something people who've never been there do to rationalize wat they can't explain themselves.|`|5f6XnInEaa	My mother had me when she was 26.    I had my son at 19.    The two do not correlate at all.|`|lZgiFW80aa	my mom had my older brother at 19 and me at 21 and i had my first kid at 19. but i dont see it having anything to do with my mom.|`|uPlJVJrjaa	I think it depends on your upbringing. My mum had me at 23 and I know that i want to be a young parent because of the bond my mum and i have. I want to be a 'with it' cool mum like mine!|`|b6fIIIhZaa	Im a teen mommy of 2 and my mother wasnt She waited till she was 24 years old and was married and she had me planned. My boyfriends parents however were in highschool when they had him|`|5BiVD3tbaa	my mom had me at 20 and I had my son at 19    interesting question.. never even thought about it
9op65iQVaa	this sounds so crazy...    but if it's true....whats done is done dude.  Listen,  first of all, you have to talk to your parents about it.  Secondly, make sure it's  yours.  You never know how many times she woken up drunk with another dude next to her.  Sorry, i know thats your friend but  you have to be 100% sure.  Ask Maury.    Running away isnt going to solve anything.  I know your only 17 and that is why you need to speak to your parents fast.  Someone needs to help you and guide you on the right direction.  Good luck and I hope all turns out well.|`|mG6Pu12Paa	Well, you are a father now.  Along with that comes responsibilities and bills.  Diapers, formula, clothes and all of the rest.    But it also comes with a brand new life that is entrusted to you.  Who will love you unconditionally.  The first time you see that child and hold it in your arms you will forget all of the negative things.|`|soFpywFcaa	be a man dont run away umm talk to her find out what she wants to keep it or have and abortion then go from there|`|VD4JgFnGaa	FACE HER FAM THATS ALL YOU CAN DO DONT RUN AWAY CUZ YOU WILL REGRET NOT KNOWING YOU BABY|`|CL4p7fccaa	Mmmmmm tricky one - are you SURE she was a virgin before you - or that there was no one after you ?    Sounds horrible I know but you do need to make sure you are the father - and the only way to do that is with a paternity test after baby is born.    I would suggest talking to YOUR parents first - you need there support & advice on this one - its a biggy.    You could ask your parents to come with you to talk to the other family for support.    Best of luck.....|`|iLvYbl5Jaa	idk 3 weeks is really early tell... But its not unheard of. No dont run away thats just gonna get you in trouble...|`|0dFLjJ1Uaa	You should do what you think is best. there are plenty of options for you and all you have to do is go to a pregnancy center and figure out if u should get an abortion or keep the baby or do adoption. You should talk to your family because your parents know what is best, and it should all work out.  Best of Luck|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Basically both of your childhoods are over.  You have to be adult now and be responsible for this new coming life.  You've got lot's of good advice.  Pony up and you'll do fine.  Let love and ethics rule.  Do the right thing.|`|3XFZHhWgaa	This is a very hard situation. Firstly, please try NOT to consider abortion. Secondly, speak to this girl about it and what she thinks you both should do. If both of you have no clue what to do, then start talking about it and think of a solution. Telling parents will be hard, but they will have to know sooner or later. Maybe, if your both not ready for parenting, offer it up for adoption.    Good Luck.|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	You guys made a mistake and now you both have to be responsible for your actions.  Running away won't make the problem go away. You have to be brave and talk to your parents and her parents. Both of you have to decide what's best for you and the baby.  Talk with her and find a way to work it out.  Good luck.

Then the answer would be yes.|`|Gc4GMyIEaa	whattt tubeee??|`|rpgYCVMLaa	I think you mean ONE tube.  No one has really tried to answer your question, so let me be the first.  I have one tube myself.  I was pregnant in november of 2008 for the first time, I am 26 years old.  They had to rush me to hospital for emergency surgery because I was bleeding internally.  They had to take my baby and my left tube.  I can still fall pregnant through my right tube.  The only problem I have is that I have a rare blood type which fights against my fetus'.  Other than that it is totally possible, so don't fret. You can even still have children without any tubes at all.  Through places like IVF, which are covered by health care now. Good luck sweetie.
AA12095483	You need to contact your doctor pronto. You may be pregnant, and with the spotting and the weird pains, you could be having an ectopic pregnancy. It's critical that you get this checked out pronto, because if the tube ruptures, you could have massive internal bleeding, shock, and yes, people do die from this. Worry about what to tell your boyfriend later, but get to your doctor right away. or check in to emergency.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	It shouldn't be that hard..if he's shocked then he's ignorant..the only reason they should be shocked is if they didn't know babies are made when people f*ck each other. So I'm guessing you  fill him in on "the talk" before you tell him...haha. Well just tell him straight out hes gonnna support it whether he likes it or not, its his baby 2. If he doesn't like it then tell him to suck it up haha! good luck|`|G1j3Ja5Iaa	you need to take a test and find out..and just go from there. and if u dont wanna be pregnant, you should be using a condom EVERYTIME or get on birth control..|`|QVfoY6WYaa	you could just be about to get your peroid. take a test! to find out for real then take it from there.|`|9op65iQVaa	well until you take a test you wont know for sure.  You sound as if you have some symptoms.  If you like, you can wait a few more days or a week and see how these symptoms progress.  But monitor yourself well and test.  unless your period comes down.  Good luck.
aLyJe1b3aa	...yeah|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Better not to drink soda anytime but especially when pregnant.  The soda part chelates minerals and especially calcium from your bones.  If you don't have enough minerals in your diet, the baby will take them from your bones.  So take you vit/min tablets and don't drink soda.|`|8RfmosODaa	I dont think you can drink alot of caffeine when you are expecting, its not good for the baby.|`|T48smu01aa	Yes...its fine a soda a day is fine :) if you want a better staright answer then ask your doctor or midwife....mine said one a day is fine!|`|01vMpHkWaa	Yes you can but be realistic about it  meaning, not more then 2 cans a day    i just had some pepsi :] calms my stress and anxiety|`|nukcYkR9aa	you are what you eat....and your baby will become what you eat, too. His/Her life depends on what you eat..so be careful! don't have too much soda.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	yeah|`|SZ0rG2QCaa	yes u can but jusst limit it to  one every other day cause if u have to much of it, it could effect the health of ur baby|`|3XFZHhWgaa	Yes you can but in moderation because the amount of sugar in them. Also, dont drink diet, fake sugar is not healthy and also try to drink caffiene free, but I was told around 2 cans of soda a day with caffiene is okay.|`|cfdooGylaa	Yes, in moderation (one can a day).|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	One soda with caffeine a day probably won't hurt anything. I just switched to caffeine free pepsi so I don't have to worry about it. Tastes the same to me. You shouldn't drink a lot of diet though, bc of the artificial sweetener in it.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Sure. Just avoid the diet kind,the artificial sweeteners aren't recommended. Just limit the regular ones with sugar and caffeine.|`|207dFmdHaa	no, not really, the caffeine isnt good for you|`|hUdKYtegaa	only caffeine free like you cant drink mountain dew! im always craving that haha!|`|OquJHwDcaa	You shouldn't because of the caffeine!|`|SRlzo5yXaa	yeah ?|`|uukU9078aa	soda is poison in either case.|`|HgMaoYIvaa	Yea, you can drink soda......(wha.......why would you ask something like that.............)|`|NwIjasICaa	no, but u can drink root beer cuz it has no caffine in it|`|x4uGfC4oaa	You can have one can of soda or one cup of coffee per day. Caffeine is a drug too, and it can harm the baby.    Try to get some caffeine-free soda.|`|lIXxTXKgaa	yeah but i would recommend staying away from it because of the high suger it contains its better if you stayed away|`|7fQ24aQQaa	Pop is fine, but there's a supplement, like Fiji water, called 'Fuda.'

But not all the time nor everyday|`|RJ8Jf73Vaa	You can you're just not supposed to have more that 200mg of caffeine per day!|`|slgYd4sEaa	yeah dont drink alcohol though|`|soFpywFcaa	yes you can but they saw not to much because of the caffeine try sprite or other sodas like that caffeine free|`|4X7miUCaaa	You shouldnt drink a lot of it when you are pregnant, however, i switched to caffeine free pepsi and have like only one, two at the most a day.  I splurged and had a small starbucks while I was at the mall tonight..I couldnt help it..gotta have that "pick me up" sometime, especially when u do daycare, like me, lol!!|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	NO ITS FORBIDDEN... lol jk go ahead|`|eemmWU0Haa	ahh yeah...!|`|a2OMNEzJaa	whatever isnt healthy for you isnt healthy for you babe.|`|x09r4OVdaa	Yes, you can drink soda when you're pregnant...    But, just don't overdo it! Don't drink too much, but maybe drinking half to a full can should be fine :)    Hope I helped at least a little! :D  ?Bri|`|0gLec1VPaa	It's just soda, of course. But I agree with the person who said the thing about the caffeine, too much is bad for you, because it can affect your child. It's a little bit like alcohol, just to a much weaker extent.|`|DkEYzONuaa	If you can't I am in trouble.  I just watch how much I drink.  I didn't have any with my first pregnancy but with this one I am not as disciplined,  I think some is okay.|`|MrP3k7LQaa	you can just not alot because it bad for the baby i watched it on doctors|`|iFjT3zTpaa	one of my best friends is pregnant..she asked her doctor about drinking soft  drinks and coffee and he said that it he does not suggest it because the baby might have a with drawl or addiction to it when he/she is born..hope i helped|`|3ievmSkcaa	Why would you drink it at all? That stuff has no taste or nutritional value, therefore being a waste of money. Drink juice instead..... mmm yummy juice.|`|BR7pYF2Haa	You can but it's unhealthy for you and the baby. Unborn babies do not need caffeine.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	You can but try not to drink to much caffeine or sugar too often,  You can also buy things like carbonated juices, mineral water or ginger ale which have no caffeine and are low in sugar.  Root beer while not low in sugar is another alternative to caffeinated sodas.  there are also caffeine free alternatives to most Sodas but they are usually diet and contain NutraSweet and other artificial sweeteners that in high doses can cause cancer.        Almost all sodas have a caffiene free choice but here is a list of some that are also artificial sweetener free:    RootBeer  Gingerale  Fresca  Fanta Strawberrry  Fanta Grape  Fanta Orange  Seven Up  Sprite  Sierra Mist Original and Cranberry Splash    I believe that you can have about 300 mg of caffeine per one day.|`|VT8WH71uaa	Yes, you can drink a caffeine free soda. I would drink a clear soda like sprite or fresca.|`|dOZksInfaa	I was just watching the t.v show The Doctors and a lady ask a similar question, but about Coffee.    Basically, soda has caffeine and it is not good for the baby in large quantities. It does to the baby what caffeine would do to you or me, i.e raising your heart rate. So if you can, try to cut it out of your daily diet or limit to one regular sized cup. So the doctors say anyways.    Hope this helped and best of wishes!|`|1UD6eEvwaa	Your only allowed a certain intake of caffiene a day. Im not sure the ammount but over this amount can cause some possible harmful effects. I havent heard of any other problems with soda though. So maybe go with the caffiene free, find out that limit from your doctor and stay with it, or steer clear of it just to be safe. It is up to you.|`|luuFs6wPaa	When i'm pregnant, I never take any carbonate drink because it will effect with my baby.|`|b6cuytMyaa	Only some.  i only know of a few like Sprite, Fresca , Fanta grade soda, fanta orange soda & fanta cherry soda.  None of those have caffeine in them.  if you have a favorite soda look on the box or can to see if it contains caffeine.  hope this helped!  :o)|`|mLbydsVIaa	yea just in moderation. try to go caffeine free if possible.   i drink soda every now and then..  coffee and soda are something to try to drink in moderation..not all the time. if so..go decaf..alot of caffeine isnt good for you and the baby..but doesnt hurt every once in a while|`|kJUqjNoKaa	From what I understand your supposed to keep the caffine level to a minimum while your pregnant. Soda itself is fine as long as it's non caffinated. Most gingerale's are, by default, non cafinated and I know major brands like Pepsi and coke have non caffinated versions available.
wiAVa1H5aa	You're fine as long as you replaced the Nuvaring on the day you removed the old one - and don't skip replacement.   No need to test really, but if you're really worried test 20 days after you think you ovulated (which you did not).|`|yfcJwQr8aa	if your within 5 days of your missed period it could be correct.  Then again the only sure fire result at that time would be a blood test.  Wait till you have a late period of about 7 days then take one|`|fzjePK5Haa	You'll have to wait until your period is late to take the test. In the meantime you can look for some of the more obvious early pregnancy symptoms. Many of them show up even before you can take a pregnancy test.   Here's a great article that explains exactly what to look for!  http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recogniz...|`|0RoI6OXEaa	Normally You have to miss a period before taking a test. I would give it another week and wait it out. You did have some kind of barrier method, so hopefully that helped.
Zy07f0Zwaa	You will only get 1 year. It is unfortunate that you just missed out but you are not being disadvantaged in any way. There was probably never going to be an ideal time for Woolworths to announce their decision because someone would always feel disadvantaged so it is just bad luck.
BIDy92Dwaa	The green-yellow colour yuck smelling vomit is called 'bile' (stomach acid). You vomit it up when there is nothing else to vomit up because there is no food or liquid in there to come out first. I used to get it a lot when I would have food poisioning or gastro. Eww.  It is normal so don't worry, and you won't harm your baby by not eating as well. iyour baby is like a paracite and will take whatever i can get from you, so in other words you will jsut feel really weak from the baby taking everything.|`|QrZcKRsDaa	It's called "bile"..it's stomach acid. Same thing has happened to me.|`|FSPAKELyaa	yip its bile, it tastes so so bad.  im still getting that 3 mornings a week at 33 weeks argh yuk.
hXoUFWL1aa	Thats okay. You still have 3 weeks to drop.|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	She just means that your bub hasn't 'dropped' yet. This is perfectly normal and varies from woman to woman. Some women will drop earlier and still have their bub's late and others will drop the same day they have their baby! Don't worry too much! If you spend a lot of time laying down or sitting down gravity is probably taking a little longer to do it's job. Try going for a half hour walk each day!     All the best xx|`|6AKKwrujaa	that is completely normal, my first didn't drop till about 39weeks and my second was just before i went into labour ...don't worry and good luck x|`|JEnsHADCaa	Hi! Congrats!    Yes! Yes! Yes! It is quite normal! All women and their pregnancies are different; some babies "drop" early on in the pregnancy and some (like all three of mine) won't "drop" until the day they are born. But if you are concerned here are a few exercises you can try:    Pelvic rocks -- On hands and knees, rock your pelvis up and down 20 times.     Pelvic rolls -- Think like a belly dancer and roll your hips around and around 10 times, then switch directions.     Lunges -- Put one foot on a chair next to you and lean sideways towards that side, then straighten up, 10 times, then switch the chair to the other side.     Squats -- If you can't get into a squat without help, have Dad/Hubby support your weight on the way down, or slide off the sofa into a squatting position. Try to keep your feet flat on the floor, slide them out farther if you need to.     Please be aware, that once baby dearest does "drop"; the amount of discomfort felt in your hips does significantly increase, as does your chances of Braxton-Hicks.    Don't rush things, let them happen and enjoy them! Best of luck to you!      Hope this helps.|`|M7cHcI0Eaa	yep its fine - some babies don't "engage" until very late on in the pregnancy.  Baby is fine although no doubt your having a hard time breathing - It gets easier when the baby moves down a bit - Good luck|`|BEXwAnxwaa	Every baby is different, some drop into the pelvis earlier than others, some wont drop until they are ready to come out, you have nothing to worry about. My son dropped quite early on but my daughter didn't drop at all until she was on her way out. Im now 36+3 weeks pregnant and my babies head is 2/5ths engaged, proof that each one is different.  hope that helps.|`|mXTmpeNRaa	yes your fine,my daughter did not drop until 7 days before she was born and she was 3 days late

I think it would be a better thing if you just went through the delivery, with the whole idea of a surprise element! After all, what's the most important thing, the health of you and the baby, regardless of the sex of the baby!!! Good luck to you! Prayers and thoughts, all will be well!|`|f924b12f4cdbe98ad9506308bb5d9c77aa	Actually, yes, they now have a blood test that you can do at home that will tell you the sex of your baby.. its expensive as all heck, the kit itself is 25 bucks, but then you have to pay an additional 275 dollars to have the test run by a lab.  THe way it works is you use a lancet (like what people test for blood sugar with) to prick your finger, you put some blood on the test card, you Fed Ex the test back to the lab, and they look to see if the maternal blood sample contains any XY chromosonal DNA.. if its present, they know that the fetus is a boy, if there is none, then they know the fetus is a girl.  When you do the test, you cannot have anyone of the male gender in the room at all, cuz then you can cross contaminate the sample and get a false male result.  I've got a kit although I havent paid to have the test run yet, because in all honesty, i think id rather go have a 3D ultrasound done for less money.

But I will answer anyway. Yes sex can be fun but not always it has to be special to be enjoyed, and you can have fore play with your clothes on but sex is without clothes. You can fall pregnant from the first time you engage in sex and you dont even have to penetrate to fall pregnant so remember that.

I'm 17, 5'6", and 120 and people are starting to get scared that /I'm/ too thin.  I'd go to a docotor if I were you. He can look at your body weight, height, and build and tell you what you need to be.    If you want to model, I don't have a problem with that, per se. But, if it requires you be unhealthy, find another career choice. You are only 15, you don't need to have a career now.

395ba13b6215bd11920db288b39e6959aa	Your sore breasts and leg cramps may be side effects from the shoot, side effects from your period, or side effects from stress aka worrying so much.    I am a bit confused about the part with your period, but I can assure you, if it was 2 and 1/2 weeks long, you aren't alone. I get mine up to a month before the shot is due and they can last three weeks.

Talk to your doc. If you are having the negative side effects of it, perhaps look into getting an IUD. Those are normal side effects of depo. My friend on it had her period every 3 months & it lasted about a month. It either causes great regularity or great irregularity. I had an IUD. Extremely effective. They last 5 years. No pills, shots, foams, condoms, etc.. to figgit with. To ease the leg cramps eat nuts, pistachios, almonds, bananas. The IUD will also make your period nearly disappear after a few months. I'd call your doc for their opinion cuz I'm not a medical person.

Mi hija cuando era muy bebita dormia unas pocas horas por dia y a la noche tampoco dormia de corrido. La gente me recomendaba que no durmiera de dia para que a la noche no se despierte. Asi lo hize y no solo que no me dio resultado sino que se desarrollo un poco menos de lo normal. Al tiempo una amiga me recomendo un libro que se llama "Duermete Ni?o" en la que te explican como hacer dormir a tu bebe. Lo hicimos como indicaba el libro. Fue un poco angustiante los primeros dias escuchar a tu bebe como llora, pero a la semana, y despues de 6 meses de no tener un sue?o normal,  empezo a dormir como corresponde. Los consejos del libro no lo hize al pie de la letra, sino algunas cosas la modifique. Al correr de las semanas su caracter habia cambiado, estaba de muy buen humor y era una nena encantadora.

Duermete ni?o, ba?arlo, cantarle, acunarlo, q se duerma conmigo y pasarlo a su cama... de todo! Yo trabajo y he venido casi sin dormir porque se despertaba hasta tres veces en la noche. Solucin? no hay. Cada nene es distinto, tienen sus tiempos. La pediatra siempre me deca que cerca del a?o y medio hacen un cambio madurativo muy importante y ese es el momento para ense?arles cosas como por ejemplo, que aprendan a dormir solitos y toda la noche.  Hace una semana q mi hijo duerme toda la noche. Como lo logr? Despus de ba?arlo le doy de comer. Jugamos un rato, le canto o bailamos, le cuento un cuento haciendole voces o caras y el se re mucho. Cuando le digo: Ahora a dormir que ya es tarde, el solo va hacia su cuarto y me pide q lo acueste. Ya entiende.  Solo te puedo dar un consejo: Paciencia y no te pongas nerviosa, ellos lo sienten. Tampoco es bueno q los dejes llorar (tambin lo prob) porque se angustian y despus te cuesta ms q se calme.  Suerte.

I bounced back quickly after delivery|`|65381a83ca0c2dcabbdc32f212074135aa	For my first pregnancy, I enjoyed swimming right to the week prior the delivery. Depending on how the baby's position is, walking 4-5 km almost on a daily basis may not be as easy in the third trimester..I mean, I waddled rather than walked since my second baby's head was really low then! But generally, low impact exercises shouldn't be a problem for any pregnant women who are medically fit. If in doubt though, talk to your doctor/gynaecologist.

No te preocupes te lo dice una madre q ha sufrido mucho por esto y q al fin hace poco acepte la realidad, no te tortures, q nada ganaras, mas bien gastaras tus energias y perderas la paciencia.|`|3380afe892c414d9d46bcfcbc9f3b2c6aa	El metodo de no darle nada hasta la proxima comida ,te aseguro q con algunos ni?os no resulta efectivo ,les da lo mismo no comer y asi lo unico q se consigue esq coman menos con el riesgo de q a la hora de obligarles no puedan comer x q su estomago se hizo mas peque?o .Yo cuando mi hija no quiere comer x algo uso el metodo de si no comes  no tendras tal ,x ejemplo  o si comes toda la comidita despues tendras un huevo kinder x ejemplo le digo y le pongo encima de la mesa para q vea q es cierto.Cuando fue creciendo usaba mas  el metodo de hablarla para q razonara ,le decia mira ves q grande es fulanito ? claro come mucho y es fuerte y ya puede hacer muchas cosas (algo q tu hijo desee hacer ,montar en bici,ir al colegio,etc ) y tu dentro de poco podras hacer esas cosas verdad hijo? claro x q comes mucho y te haras fuerte como mama y papa . Es igual la forma q uses el caso es q no se agobie con la comida y q no la vea como una obligacion ,puedes comprarle una cuchara nueva con forma de animal o mu?eco o lo q sea q sea diferente peque?a y especial para el y le dices bamos a comprarte ua cuchara especial para q comas x q ya eres grande y fuerte y veras como puedes comer tu solito y le dejas q lo coma solo a ver si asi se anima ,mientras come le cuentas algo q le entretenga ,un cuento , una historia ,de la abuela ,del abuelo ,de sus primitos ,algo q llame su atencion ,sin darse cuenta se lo comera y no le costara si esta entretenido.Sigue buscando el metodo hasta encontrar cual te resulta x q todos los ni?os son diferentes y solo practicando sabras cual es el mejor para el .otro metodo  es le pones  en el plato menos cantidad para q no le de cosa ver tanta comida, si ves q no resulta haces al contrario le pones mas de lo normal y le deces solo la mitad ,si se la come estara comiendo lo q le corresponde aunq para el sea menos.|`|5f3a098e3a6067f1e481eabdcca36a50aa	MI Gorilita tiene 20 meses y come de todo desde chiquito a veces cuando no quiere ,como delante de el y se le antoja y despues acepta la comida dale agua o jugo en su vasito cerca de su comida , sientate con el a comer , juega mucho con el famoso avionsito ,la hora de la comida tiene que ser divertida!!!!|`|b1a2b1d410f89fafa54e625fca6e0b75aa	MIRA CADA NI?O SE LLEVA SU TIEMPO Y CADA UNO  ES UN MUNDO NO DEJES QUE TE AGOBIEN CON QUE  AHORA LE TOCA ESTO Y DESPUES LO OTRO   YO TENGO UNO DE 5 A?OS Y HASTA LOS 2 A?OS  Y MEDIO NO COMIO NADA SOLIDO ENTERO Y QUE   ESTA DE MIEDO MIDE  1.25 Y PESA 30KG Y LLEVA LA  TALLA DE UN NI?O DE OCHO A?OS Y AHORA COMO DE  TODO NO TE AGOBIES UN BESO Y SUERTE|`|4b0329e7e456c40ea37d6228161c2d1eaa	La verdad eso de hablar espaniol es relativo ya que aunque lei 3 veces la pregunta aun tengo dudas! Te refieres a que le quieres introducir alimentos mas solidos? quiero decir no papillas ya? Mira si es asi yo tengo un bb de 17 meses y desde lo 10 meses ya no come papillas, lo que hice fue picarle muy finito verduritas como zanahoria, brocoli, coliflor, papa, calabaza etc. y ponerlas al vapor hasta que quedaran suavecitas y luego hacer una sopa normal de pasta con salsa de jitomate agregando caldo de pollo con pequenios trocitos de pollo y luego virtiendo ls verduritas para que queden aun mas suavecitas, asi que aunque no mastique muy bien esta todo tan suve que se va acostumbrando a masticar ya luego puedes poner las verduras menos suaves pero nunca crudas! hasta como a los 3 o 4 anios, puedes hacer una buena cantidad y refrigerarla cuando la recalientes puedes agregar quesito que gratine le encantara! y habras cubierto al menos 3 de los grupos alimenticios de un jalon. Hablando de frutas el platano y la pera son muy buenos ya que son suaves y las peras Barlet les encantan a los ninos por dulces y jugositas partela en cuarterones quitando la cascara y el corazon y luego dasela a mordidas, una vez que le agarran el gusto a la comida comen de todo, no esta bien ya lo se pero mi bb come hasta chile, eso si le encanta la comida de grandes! si no te come la fruta y tienes extractor de jugos hazle un buen jugo con unas 3-4 frutas combinando los sabores, no adquirira la fibra pero al menos las vitaminas y los minerales. Trata de darle comida que el tome solo con sus manitas como galletitas para nino dulces, o crackers, algun cereal pequenio que no se le vaya a atorar, etc. Suerte con tu bb|`|6c1c337fe7869f1549df88040e927e03aa	1o dale la comida que le toca, busca algo que le ayude a comer.  2o Si no quiere le das el segundo plato si es luego le toca otro sino hasta su prxima comida nada de nada. Le das lo que le toque, sino come ms come menos, y al final te acabara comiendo, cuesta un poco pero ten mucha pacincia, por que son ms listos de lo que parece, como ya lo hiciste una vez y le cambiate la comida te lo volver hacer.

8320586775a9ac69ad095ef26516eb32aa	In 2000 I started having problems with my heart, it had been "fluttery" for about 4 months.  The doctor did a stress test and complete blood work.  After talking for a while, he asked if I could be pregnant.  I laughed.  He did a urine pregnancy test.  I was!  I had a ultra sound done the following week and found out I was 20 weeks pregnant!  I never considered a fluttery heart to be a pregnancy symptom, but my fluttery heart will be six next month!  I had none of the symptoms I had with my other two kids.|`|243f21ed9d302d0240502b2f9f09c1fcaa	whenever I'm pregnant I get EXTREMELY sleepy and tired all day  if i sit for more than 5 minutes at a time a fall asleep..once i fell asleep while i was cooking!!!!.. right in the kitchen leaning against the counter i woke up to the sound of the smoke alarm...i had to throw my pan away!|`|AA11455719	Yes!  I have 4 children: ages 6, 4, 2, & 1.  When I suspected I was pregnant with my last daughter I took two home pregnancy tests that both said negative.  But I didn't believe it because I know my body & after having 3 kids already plus one miscarriage I've been pregnant enough times to know.  If you know you are then most likely you are.  Trust yourself you know your body better than any doctor or test.|`|AA12303291	I have three children. I knew with all three of them when I was pregnant b/c I had very bad morning sickness. Sorry, I wish I could help. If you think you might be pregnant don't guess, go get a test girl!  Best of luck to you!|`|e4fe44286a6ca2b6e9a14f435f5ee995aa	I have two children.  I knew before I was pregnant because of the fatigue it hits HARD and everyone I speak to has this symptom if no other.  My breasts dont hurt until way later but I also have mild cramping WAY before my period thats how I knew as well but it was the fatigue that gave it away EVERY time.|`|ec61b688c1f39fbcfc469305b9fe45daaa	I knew right away I was pregnant with all three of my kids.  I could not stay awake during the day (I normally never took naps). I also had full feeling from the start.|`|AA12185963	I didnt have any signs of pregnancy this time, ( my third baby). I just knew.|`|f87b49d97828b4858f5bf6b10fa08cebaa	I had a knowing feeling the first two. Just a dif feel to my soul/heart. I can't explain it.It was weird because I knew I was preg by these feelings. I never knew when I would have a period and sometimes went 2 mo without or 4-6 wks on one so I couldn't tell by being late! I wasn't supposed to have a 3rd due to  problems from the 1st. My family went to the lake to camp for a few days before I was to have a hysterctomy.  Swimming and walking up a steep hill made my side hurt really bad but I figured it was just the female problems at work! Anyway I went to have the surgery and the dr. told me he couldn't do it because I was preg! I cried b/c I had already made peace with only having two babies.I hadn't had any of the rare feelings with her but that may because my mind was on having to have the surgery and from being so messed up physically anyway.Well I had the little girl I always wanted to add to my boys and when she was 2 mo I had the surgery!Best wishes with yours!|`|AA11801298	When I was pregnant with my son I had very bad morning sickness that followed into the second trimester.    I'm currently 18 weeks pregnant, and I have absolutely NO symptoms (other than the expanding/nonexisting waistline).  The only thing that makes the pregnancy seem "real" to me is the fact that I can now feel the baby move (for the last 2 weeks), and I had an ultrasound done and saw my baby.      Hope this is what you're lookin' for.....

AA11407961	Yes, you could be pregnant, or you could *get* pregnant from unprotected sex.  There is absolutely no way to know if you are pregnant until at least 8 days (and sometimes up to 3 1/2 weeks) after sex because it takes the fertilized egg at least that long to reach the uterus, start implanting, and produce enough HCG (the hormone detected by pregnancy tests) to cause any physical changes in your body.    If you think you might be pregnant, I would suggest you stop taking the Pill entirely until you know for sure.  The main ingredient of the Pill is estrogen, the same hormone that was involved in the DES scandal--which caused various types of birth defects.  If you are interested, do a Web search for "DES daughters".|`|AA11602885	Sometimes after coming off and going back on the pill it can cause breast tenderness.  Yes you could get pregnant, always that chance even if you didn't miss your pills.  Most women will have a couple of months of infertility after stopping the pill.  It took me 6 months to GET pregnant after stopping.  Everyone is different though.  i would advise to continue to use the Pill through its course and see if start your period. I would also advise that you use a condom the remainder of the time that you take the Pill.|`|2af42c3e2a4aaf1d4386d5936cfda3e0aa	there is a chance of getting pregnact... but if you started a fresh pack of pills them your period might not come for another month, so if it is late don't freak, make sure your use protection for the next month or so...|`|7f8ab26d3f500f4da901928824fe9dbcaa	sore nipples could just mean that your body is readjusting to the pill.  Until you have been back on the pill for at least a month, you should use a second form of protection.  I would advice you call a doc. to see if the meds would hurt the baby, I dont know that one.
AA12025958	I babysat a 3 yr old when I was pregnant with my daughter...I also had a 2 yr old of my own....It was miserable trying to keep the kids busy, not letting them beat each other up, making them share, and all this in the middle of summer. I then had my daughter, and two weeks later started watching a 10 mth old...needless to say, it didnt work out. There was too much fighting and the little girl wanted to be held all the time which I couldnt do since I was holding and breastfeeding my newborn pretty much 24/7. My advice to you is if you have to babysit, take alot of "me" breaks especially when the kids are napping (hopefully at the same time) and if it gets to be too much, put your child in the crib, and the child your babysitting in a pack and play or other area that keeps him/her safe and take a breather. As long as the kids cant hurt themselves then they will be fine while you take a minute to yourself. If you dont have to work, dont do it....babysitting two younguns can be more stressful and not worth it. Good luck.|`|AA12062396	Try having a 12 month old and a newborn (both yours) and you're a single mom.

AA11210405	Congrats!  I am at 14 weeks today, too! Anyway, those pains are very normal.  Your muscles are stretching more than ever ( and preparing to stretch even more! ) Go get a book called " what to expect when you are expecting" by Heidi Murkoff.  It's the pregnancy bible and will help with all these questions. Your question as well as many others that you would not expect is in there.  It's excellent in describing all of these little things that worry moms and help distinguish when something is "normal" or not.   Good Luck!|`|AA12084255	More than likely it's round ligament pain.|`|55a0b44ae232d5e463255c61a889ca78aa	It's normal.  The fetus is probably pressing against an organ.  You're not hurting the baby.|`|4d6e711dc5787acb3d47123e971e9d4aaa	It's Normal and it is not hurting your baby...

Your muscles are relaxing and everythign is getting shifted...you will be starting to show anytime now if you aren't already.  You may also get some cramping...nothing to worry about unless it doesn't go away or if you start spoting.  Soon you will miss this...instead of pain when you sneeze, you will pee :-)  You are fine!|`|AA10568752	Yes its normal. im 7months and i expreince the same thing
AA12185963	It took me forever to figure out that's what it was! you know how when you have the hiccups your stomach kind of jumps. To me it felt like little bitty kicks but I could tell that it wasn't kicks. Its like the baby is lightly bouncing with each hiccup. It felt funny, but cute.|`|AA10427515	If your baby is really active, it can be difficult to tell, but usually with the hiccups, you can watch your belly jump at regular intervals. It will feel different than a kick.|`|847fc4fde6fbb833a77d9a8046ec785baa	it feels like little bumps. They're more consistent than the baby kicking.    You'll learn the difference.

Congratulations and good luck!|`|d77ece5f77194c95da1208f7b4e0a13aaa	I think you'll know when it happens. You will feel a twitch in your abdomen - the rhythm is similar to when you have hiccups, but the feeling isn't as strong.

You will know...|`|AA10142580	Yes i can... if feels just like someone inside of you is hiccuping!    But don't worry about what everyone say's!!!    Because the position of the baby & how small the baby is does play some part in being able to feel them or not!!!    Some women don't ever feel when their  baby's have hiccups... and that's ok!!!

94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	yes and no. Getting it off your chest may help end the crush. Sometimes it just hurts because you are keeping a little secret to yourself. So if you hear yourself say it outloud then you may realize you really don't like him as much as you think and you can move on. Atleast you realize he is mean to you. So you can keep your wits abou tyou.  For one the girlfriend: why would you want a boy who would date a girl he doesnt' like?  If he is mean to you now, think about once he realizes he can be because you like him and aren't going anywhere.  So it really doesn't matter if he likes the girl or not. a jerk is a jerk.  If it would make you feel better to tell him then do it, if not then i would say NO.  there are worse things then him not liking you, you could end up with a total jerk!|`|AA11780203	Why do it when you know he has a girlfreind?

AA12185963	Key things to remember about hCG levels:  About 85% of normal pregnancies will have the hCG level double every 48 - 72 hours. As you get further along into pregnancy and the hCG level gets higher, the time it takes to double can increase to about every 96 hours.   Caution must be used in making too much of hCG numbers. A normal pregnancy may have low hCG levels and deliver a perfectly healthy baby. The results on an ultrasound after 5 - 6 weeks gestation are much more accurate than using hCG numbers.   An hCG level of less than 5mIU/ml is considered negative for pregnancy, and anything above 25mIU/ml is considered positive for pregnancy.   hCG is measured in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/ml).   A transvaginal ultrasound should be able to see at least a gestational sac once the hCG levels have reached between 1,000 - 2,000mIU/ml. Because levels can differentiate so much and conception dating can be wrong, a diagnosis should not be made by ultrasound findings until the level has reached at least 2,000.   A single hCG reading is not enough information for most diagnoses. When there is a question regarding the health of the pregnancy, multiple testings of hCG done a couple of days apart give a more accurate look at assessing the situation.   hCG levels should not be used to date a pregnancy since these numbers can vary so widely.   There are two common types of hCG tests. A qualitative hCG test just looks to see if hCG is present in the blood. A quantitative hCG test (or beta hCG) measures the amount of hCG actually present in the blood.                 Guideline to hCG levels during pregnancy:  hCG levels in weeks from LMP (gestational age)* :    3 weeks LMP: 5 - 50 mIU/ml   4 weeks LMP: 5 - 426 mIU/ml   5 weeks LMP: 18 - 7,340 mIU/ml   6 weeks LMP: 1,080 - 56,500 mIU/ml   7 - 8 weeks LMP: 7, 650 - 229,000 mIU/ml   9 - 12 weeks LMP: 25,700 - 288,000 mIU/ml   13 - 16 weeks LMP: 13,300 - 254,000 mIU/ml   17 - 24 weeks LMP: 4,060 - 165,400 mIU/ml   25 - 40 weeks LMP: 3,640 - 117,000 mIU/ml   Non-pregnant females:   Postmenopausal:       * These numbers are just a GUIDELINE-- every womans level of hCG can rise differently. It is not necessarily the level that matters but rather the change in the level.|`|55a0b44ae232d5e463255c61a889ca78aa	Your pregnancy hormone level.|`|AA10115827	HCG is a hormone that the fetus produces. It goes up the farther along you are. The bigger the baby gets, the higher your hcg level goes. The doctors can actually tell about how far along you are by those levels.

It's kinda cool,|`|02ddc7641cef40602e3b8a40349c42f7aa	HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is  the hormone the embryo releases after implantation.  You have to take a blood test and this is not only to show you are pregnant but also to see if the pregnancy is progressing well.     It doubles every 2-3 days. The numbers are very wide and different in every pregnancy.     If you are not pregnant it will be lower than 5.     if you are, then the level will grow in thousands. lets say 5000  at 5  weeks  .  It grows till week 9-10,  up to 200000  then it drops  to  3000-100000 2nd and 3rd trimester and stays that way.    It is bad if the level is OK , then  it goes down  1.)      or   doesnt double  (2) .   It shows a comming  misscarriage (1). or an ectopic pregnancy (2).    This means that you have to take blood tests every week or every 2-3 days if you are concerned.|`|ee8e8c18fa17d461a824ec2f91d835b7aa	Human Chorionic Gonadotropin  is a hormone found in a womans blood or urine as early as 10 days after conception.  www.conceivingconcepts.com   You can read up on the whole thing.

No puede estar embarazada ya que el ovulo estaba demasiado maduro como para fecundarse con el espermatozoide, asi que si al dia siguiente menstruo, eso significa que no hubo fecundacion, ya que el endometrio estaba desechando la capa que seria la placenta, en caso de embarazo, no habria sangrado.|`|deaaf9e19b0c5e2593c643def7ee2031aa	PSS PUEDE SER KE SI DEVIDO A QUE EL OVULO SE ABRE  PARA EMPEZAR SU PERIODO DE MENSTRUACION|`|eb35049c486b5d6792faedd7230de6bfaa	Si puede, no quiere decir que lo este, solo que la mestruacin indica que el ovulo que estaba listo para ser fecundado termino su tiempo de espera, entonces no pas nada con ese, pero viene otro y escuche en programas especiales sobre esto que durante la mestruacin si es posible embarazarse.|`|f3d2899b91695cec5a6d77aac8ee872eaa	Si lo que dices es totalmente cierto, no estaria embarazada la pregunta es ... es cierto lo que dices?|`|b30f3f5174bb2e0eae4dc2ca2f7c1edfaa	bueno amigo dejame decirte q muchas personas toman eso de la mentruacion como un metodo anticonceptivo pues segun la informacion q hasta  ahora e leido ese es un metodo no 100% confiable debido a q en el cuerpo de la mujer se encuentran 2 ovulos y no siempre bajan a la misma ves en la mentruacion asi q puede haber probabilidades q ella qde embarazada si no utilizaste alguna otra proteccion extra|`|dd2fb3c16b0e13a0fda53ef7c8187fdeaa	no de ningun modo, ya ovulo y no puede quedar embarazada,si esta embarazada abri los ojos porque hay gato encerrado|`|36c3433d7840b0d03e75b7419ae7ca87aa	Improbable pero no imposible.|`|b163383d63774deaff5033da6ee57604aa	porque no hacer una prueba de embarazo en un laboratorio asi seria mas confiable saberlo|`|5006a927a6d91d18623c75405541599caa	Despreocupate, no tiene ninguna posibilidad, estaba dentro de sus dias infertiles|`|9c3b3e583af640271566390c5d6c3eb5aa	por supuesto que si es uno de los dias en q mas riesgo tiene de kedar embarazada|`|1e9ca6184dee1cad2a43c128e0c562a2aa	no     lo  creo  y   aproposito     USA  UN   CONDON    ala proxima  haci  no  nos  haces  esta  pregunta  otra  ves  dentro  de  un  mes.......    actua  con  rresponsabilidad !!!!!!!!!  no  te  estoy  rreganando   te  estoy  aconsejando   ok......  piensalo........|`|e9cf1af2155fd84d42f3dbf07ac9a27aaa	PRESIENTO QUE VAS A SER PAP    FELICIDADES!!!!|`|266699205ac3d00a1146ec60ca9fbcdaaa	claro que no|`|AA10681564	Siempre, absolutamente siempre hay riesgo de embarazo, en cada momento del ciclo el riesgo es diferente.

El hecho de que a uno no le atraiga una prctica, no la vuelve una "cochinada" , son prejuicios... y algunos, como la chica que pregunta, las utiliza como prctica anticonceptiva.  Respuesta:   No, tcnicamente es imposible que quedes embarazada durante tu menstruacin porque el tejido que servira de "colchn" al huevo fecundado se est desprendiendo... es ms... el huevo a fecundar se desprendi das antes de ello... pero ten cuidado, rara vez , pero ocurre que en menstruaciones muy largas (de siete das)  y si se tienen relaciones los ltimos das, hay una posibilidad de que un nuevo folculo haya madurado y se desprenda del ovario, entonces s...  tambin toma en cuenta que hay estados de ansiedad que te pueden provocar un "falso embarazo" o sangrados intermenstruales que pueden ser confundidos con la propia menstruacin y entonces s es otra cosa.

No come?o vai doer um pouco por algum tempo. Mais se vc ja teve rela??es com ele algumas vezes, ja n?o era pra estar sangrando. Se esta sangrando  por que esta machucando.  A posi??o pode influenciar, se vc esta sentindo dor, mude de posi??o.  Dica: fassa amor com seu namorado sempre no papai e mam?e, at vc n?o sentir mais dor, depois, que vc ja n?o sentir nenhuma dor, vai testando outras posi??es.  Va com calma que o sexo  muito bom, mais tem que ser prezeroso pra ambos, n?o apenas pro homem. N?o deixe que seja um sacrificio fazer amore com seu namorado, mais sim um estimulo pra vc!!

If it's because she afraid, get a can of air freshener... vanilla is soothing and helps with sleeping... tell her it's scare repeller and let her spray it just once.      Or    When my oldest was 2 we had the same problem.  We did that and added a ritual good night message:  "Sweet dreams I love you, Angels watching over you, I love you Good Night".

Is there any reason or just because she's used to it and you let her.     *When she comes to your room, take her back to her room kiss her goodnight and go back to bed. If she comes in again, do the same thing. You may have to do that several times a night. If she goes once without coming to your room reward her. Tell her she is such as big girl etc. It also may be an incentive.   *Give her a fairy (any stuffed animal) and tell her the fairy will watch over her and be with her all through the night.

3a15a185741af8118978069daa9d695daa	I'm happy you lost all that weight. Good for you. Get used to the staring thing. Boys, especially in High School, are gonna look. They always do. If you are looking for a boyfriend, and he's someone who keeps staring at you, confidence is key. Go up to him. Say hi. Ask him out if he's too shy. See if he'd like some help with his homework or if he could help you out. See if he wants to catch a movie. It nice that you think you look good, but you have to portray that you know you do and have the confidence to stand up for yourself. Whatever happens, don't let any boy or man control you. That is something only you can do. Don't dress and be sexy for the boys, dress for you! Anyway, you'll do fine. Stay sweet and be yourself. Doesn't matter what others think, as long as you are happy with you, that's what matters. I was a curvy thing myself in high school and had the same experiences. I wasn't fat by any means, but had curves. Boys will look. It's instinct. Anyway, good luck and if you want more tips, IM or e-mail me. I'm more than happy to help. Good Luck hun!!!!!|`|AA10673599	Who says that a guy have to make the first move?

Expect for take the ball into your court. If you find a guy attractive and are interested and notice that he's try to eye you. Go talk to him and see what's up.        My own opinion is that it takes some guys time. I was such a flirt back then that this was not a problem. Girls were only upset when I didn't flirt with them. Probably because they thought I was making some statement about them. Which I honestly can't remember if I was or not.       Find out who you are and think about what are qualities you are looking for in a bf. Then find the boy, but word of advice; Women are usually disappointed with the bf because he didn't live up to the imaginary image. Be reasonable with what you expect, be safe this high school and not the end game, you have years and years to go, and don't worry, relax enjoy life and people will want to be with you because they will want to know why you're so damn happy and relax.        Don't just use your curvy body to get a boy or you might end up in situations you don't want. Use your mind also, find someone you want to be good friends with. In the words of me the formerly screwed up high schooler, I was only chasing the girl with the honey on her lips. Then I found the girl with honey in her mind and that was a trip. She actually had something to say was intelligent and cool to be with. She set the standard on what girls and later women I wanted to date.       We ended up good friends after the relationship. This was my fault was like a dog at a hydrant convention back then. Had to be constantly date to keep up my statis as truely untameable. This type of person you should probably stay away from. I was nice in high school I knew my boundaries but dating was not for real for me. I knew I wasn't going to marry any of them so I dated to experience the kiss and then moved on for the next.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Go wash your mind out with Holy Water. Bad Girl!    They are noticing you but at this age boys are afraid and yet extremely horny. They don't talk to you because they are afraid of how you will react. You don't talk to them because you are afraid of being labeled a sl*t. You also know that all they want is to get inside you. It is not a fantasy that is puberty, the mad rush to claim one's sexuality. Clue, if you do that is it.    Be greatful that they like the way you look. Be more greatful that you like the way you look.    As for flirting, ignore it. The less childish you let them behave the less childish they will behave. Soon they may even look past your t*ts and *ss and look into your eyes to see how beautiful you truly are. They need to get to know the you inside and not just the inside of you.    Be open with your friends about who you are and be good to others and pretty soon the you that is you will be more attractive than the you that people see when they see you. Believe me you will like the new you better so will they.    Oh yea, it helps if you have something to say when you finally do talk. Figure out what it is you want to do with your life, what thing you like , what things you don't and wha you believe in. otherwise you will sound like a blithering aire head.    Now stop having impure thoughts and go read a book, and not one of those trashy girl magazines or cheesy romance novels. Try reading "Illusions"  by Richard Bach.

La magnitud de estos signos y sntomas de embarazo puede variar en cada mujer. Por ejemplo, el atraso menstrual es un signo importante en pacientes cuyo ciclo menstrual es regular, pero puede no serlo en una mujer que experimenta habitualmente retrasos. As mismo, los sntomas caractersticos del embarazo suelen ser ms notorios en el primer embarazo de la mujer que en los posteriores.   Como dice anteriormente, los sntomas dependen de cada mujer, y pueden o no existir. A algunas les aparecen desde el primer momento sin ni siquiera haber tenido todava la falta.  Personalmente en mi primer embarazo no tuve ningn signo y en el segundo todos los posibles y desde el momento de la concepcin.

f0e23dc077ba403f1629b7d953d51a4aaa	Your parents love you very much and you are not grown yet. If when you turn 18 or older, you could go and stay with her and get to know her. When you didn't know she was your birth mom, you had no desire to get to know her better. So, it is not like you saw something special in her. Remember... your adoptive parents are your true parents and your birth mom gave birth to you. So if you didn't have a desire to go stay with this "cousin" before you knew who she was, you should wait until you are older. Being adopted is not any different to your parents, than if you were their birth child. To them, you are their baby forever. They chose you...how blessed you are! You will never have the relationship with your birth mom that you have with your parents. Let them finish raising you and guiding you through life! God bless you!|`|856816016826d88ced090db2423ab842aa	I personally think that would be fine, actually A REALLY GOOD IDEA. Maybe you could be both of their daughters since you still want your mom. See if your mom wants to take you back?? discuss it with them and see how they feel!! good  luck!!|`|c82d41ad2a8a3cb76084f1d708d3589baa	yes it wud be a good idea|`|dd4c979cb723a3dc109d94a77d112486aa	I really think that you are too young to understand all of the things that go along with an adoption. I don't think it's a good idea to just jump in and try to begin a relationship. You need to talk to your adoptive parents and make some kind of an arrangement to get together and get to know one another before you even think about spending a summer with her. Don't invite yourself either. It may also be beneficial for you to see a therapist too before you jump into things.|`|a68687f0f9530d1ef44aaecc894212e6aa	I am considering giving my baby up for adoption and I have to be real. If I do give this child away...I know I wouldn't want it back.    If you were able to sit and talk with your birth mom...then you know that she loves you. Find her reasons and it will help you to find closure. I don't think there is anything wrong with it. Get to know her but don't leave home for her. Spend some time...but not a whole summer.    And don't spend money on a therapist or anything crazy like that. You sound like a confident, rational, and loving human being. I see no abandonment issues in you and I think u are extremely mature for your age. You don't need someone doing any psycho-analysis stuff on you to figure that out.|`|99b4cf88ece722c9db633d1b5a81e87faa	Stay with your adoptive parents.  I would if my mother gave me up.|`|AA12059569	Have you ask your birth mom if she would like to spend a summer with you?  If she is all for it then you need to go to your adoptive parents and tell them that you would like to spend time with your real mom just getting to know her so you will know more about yourself.  Tell them how much you love them for taking you and raising you but let them know this is something you really want to do.|`|6abc9bcdf88bb01291b9d037264d5604aa	Has she invited you to come stay with her?

Don't forget who raised you!|`|f088fdbe8439419e4fbb8a496d7d5dadaa	well get her phone number ,e mail and tell her how you feel|`|c0f46f82e2e9e94b7f54e6854e7c8b90aa	I'm not sure about that... it might be too much too soon.
d93569f577829db1c895d0867a499a44aa	First and foremost, quit trying too hard... anxiety over conception/no conception each month can act as a block to even the enjoyment of the act.    Focus on the feeling between you... raise the magic and the desire with the thought of creation of life being only the fire starter! lol Strong, lively babies are created best with passion, not determination.    Check out this link  http://www.ovulation-calculator.com/fert...  for some herbal teas to increase the physical health and likelihood of pregnancy as well.    Make sure your husband does not shower or bathe in excessively hot water... tends to kill the sperm somewhat. Restrict sexual activity to about every three days... increases the number of sperm in most men. Use your morning temperature to identify when you are ovulating too.

Advise her to get tested...  but just know that when you first start using OrthoEvra, your periods WILL be a bit screwy, so a little deviation from her "normal" period is to be expected.  Just to be safe, she should probably get tested, though.  If it turns out she's NOT pregnant, she needs to wait until the end of her next period to put a new patch on... and this time, make sure she changes it every week on the same day!!  :)

(PERODO FRTIL    D para saber quando voc est ovulando:  - Temperatura do corpo aumenta.  - Ocorre elimina??o de uma espcie de muco vaginal.  - O desejo sexual aumenta.  O perodo frtil corresponde aos dias em que a mulher tem uma chance maior de engravidar e vai depender da dura??o do ciclo menstrual dela. A ovula??o (libera??o do vulo pelo ovrio) marca o meio do ciclo menstrual e geralmente ocorre em torno de 14 dias antes do primeiro dia (incio) da prxima menstrua??o. A ovula??o representa o perodo de maior fertilidade da mulher. Calculando o dia provvel da ovula??o, ainda temos que levar em conta uma "margem de seguran?a" de 5 dias antes e 5 dias depois, onde existe risco grande de gravidez.)      3- A sua menstrua??o atrasou mais do que o normal?    4- Voc sentiu sintomas de gravidez?

Go into human resources or ask your boss for the correct forms to fill out, your MD has to fill them out as well so have them ready when you go 4 a check-up so that you do not have to make another trip. Also, your employer has to keep your current insurance up for a certain amount of time while you are away. There is a lot more to the law than we all think. Do not expect your employer to tell you any or all of your rules and rights either. Every state has their own office that deals with this.

AA11808736	A plula do dia seguinte deve ser tomada o mais rpido possvel. S funciona se for ingerida em no mximo 72 horas aps o sexo.   preciso tomar duas plulas, num intervalo de 12 horas entre uma e outra. Quanto mais cedo a mulher ingerir as plulas, melhor: d mais tempo de evitar que o espermatozide fecunde o vulo. Caso isso j tenha ocorrido, as plulas fazem com que o vulo n?o consiga ser implantado no tero, o que impede a gravidez.  Como todo mtodo, h uma margem de falha: mesmo se ingerida de acordo com as recomenda??es, ela n?o consegue evitar a gravidez em 2% dos casos. Outra coisa:  mais eficiente quando a mulher usa a plula o mais rpido possvel, de preferncia logo nas horas seguintes ao ato sexual.|`|e6dfeaf7e24714ace8e2baee58ece4ecaa	em duas semanas ela j naum tem efeito!!  o efeito  confavel em at 12 horas, aps esse perodo de 12 em 12 horas sua efeccia cai, at 72 horas h chances menores de fazer efeito.  o dano que ela causa ao bbe  a morte....  pra voc, depende do seu organismo...  nesse perodo de 2 a 3 semanas, existem outros remedios que ocasionam o aborto, e n?o mais previnem a concep??o, porm estes remdios s?o extremamente perigosos pra voc...|`|5ad8ff20fa3e3843cf9beb1b0d2d2452aa	at o dia seguinte, caraplida!!!    ou n?o teria este nome, n?    j que VC se pr-ocupa tanto com o tal de "aborto" - porque? porque? - n?o usou camisinha?|`|9ec77a73e1e50ca3a5a72cb89e3619e8aa	o nome j diz , dia seguinte|`|2d79025d6e1cb900a0d19ad4c55fb912aa	O efeito na realidade, ocorre at 120 horas aps o coito, no entanto  mais eficaz nas primeiras 72 horas ps-coito. Existem 2 mtodos: o mtodo de Yuzpe, q associa etinilestradiol ao levonogestrel, em altas doses, ou o mtodo progestnico isolado, constitudo de levonogestrel isolado, tambm em gde quantidade. O mtodo de Yuzpe  mais barato, porm o do levonogestrel isolado  mais eficaz (85%, contra 57% no Yuzpe).     Note q em 120 horas ps coito, embora ainda funcione, o efeito  menor. Nesse caso, o mtodo contraceptivo mais eficaz  a inser??o de DIU de cobre (99% de eficcia). ATEN??O: o DIU  introduzido pelo ginecologista. De qq maneira, procure um ginecologista de sua confian?a para melhor orienta??o.     Em termos mdico-legais, a plula do dia seguinte n?o provoca aborto.

Then a year later had my son, and he would drink twice the amount of "Boobie milk" my daughter did, then when it was time for the baby foods, he would eat almost 3 jars at one meal, or two of the bigger jars..and drink a huge entire bottle of it, and he ate this like 6 times a day, just mass meals.. My doc said hes all good and to this day hes the healthiest non fat and sweetest thing ever.

My sister-in-law was 7 months along before she even knew she was pregnant, simply because she kept having periods.|`|f9f5eb7a2590ee5242a18dc42abeef7baa	Very small chance.  Your body might be adapting to the  HCG (pregnancy hormone).  It might be spotting too.  Have yourself checked.  :)  Congratulations and good luck.|`|c104992f5b53dbbbde165f065376218caa	yes its very possible. always use a pregancy test kit to find out.|`|6a0706001d705b83e9a23cf12ee30595aa	Yes it can happen.

You know what, I should listen to my own advice, my husband is lucky to get it once a month.|`|3236f5358eeeaca5a9260bfc660166abaa	Everyone is different.  You'll have some weeks with no drive, then some weeks you'll have Extreme drive.  Don't fret this is a part of pregnancy, everything is unpredictable, I'm sure your hubby is affected by this too.  Mine was affraid of sex...affraid to hurt the baby.  HE sounds very understanding.  Things will change.  Congrats and good luck.|`|fe35f8ef5680eaad17889a4ff0a6a2f5aa	Your hormones are CRAZY right now!  Don't feel bad that your "drive" seems non-existant.  Every woman's body reacts differently to the hormones, and this is the way your body deals with it.  Mine on the other hand, was quite the opposite until AFTER the baby was born.  Then my "drive" drove off for awhile!!

Although most people tend to say they have this problem in the first trimester and are feeling much better by the second trimester there is no standard for normal or not.  Talk to your doctor next time you visit.  Until then be grateful you have such a wonderful, understanding husband.|`|c539a4a322f3617e661edf39c6a33e8baa	Your not alone.I am 24 weeks pregant right now and I don't wanna have sex with my husband and  I only see him on either every 5 days or every 10 days due to his work.

But if you want to be on the safe side, just relax and try not to stress.|`|6840c914614061ccb9e25e592600ed41aa	It's common to have cramping and spotting in early pregnancy around the time period would normally start.  That was my first sign of pg both times, feeling like my period would start but then it didn't.    Try not to worry too much - I had spotting that lasted a month my first pregnancy and my son is just fine.  I know it's hard not to worry though.|`|a427f71cba4f6be3dc98c55a63d8c870aa	Yes, I had exactly the same situation happen to me.  I continued to spot well into the third month.  Just make sure to rest whenever possible.  Lie down with your feet up and be sure to eat properly (after the third month you shouldn't lie on your back any longer).  I would even lie down during breaks and lunches at work.  I even remember lying down in the accountants office while having my taxes done.  I had this until around the forth month and then the symptoms cleared up and all was fine.  My son is almost a year now and he is doing very well.    Just remember though (and this is the only thought that got me through that emotionally horrible time) if you do happen to miscarry - then there was something seriously medically wrong with the baby so it would be for the best.      Good luck - I'll be thinking about you.|`|6e3a0e1c135ec086e105ec4783f6a1bbaa	I had the same thing happen with my first baby. I bled very slightly and convinced myself I could`nt be pregnant.

c941910df625e0b24af1e39f7e3195c7aa	Go to the doctor.  Even if you aren't pregnant, your doctor needs to figure out when you aren't having your period.  There could be many reasons--from stress, anorexia, ovary problems etc.|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	You should go to the doctor. I had a friend who got negative blood and urine tests during the first three months of pregnancy. And even if you aren't pregnant, it's not normal to miss your period like that (if you are regular); and it could lead to serious problems; even infertility. So I wouldn't bet on another test; I would go to my doctor ASAP.|`|ea320a52c38617683876ade694b13537aa	not always, it should say on the box, but you do still need to go to the doctor.|`|1eede7af1952b33e16d9841bfdc4d4f3aa	my cousin took four of those things and came out neg every time.  now she has a beautiful son.  they can be wrong.  it says so right on the box.  but this could also be stress.  see a doctor and have a blood test done.|`|0f0d1b056af8fb0938992dd93449a182aa	it may be stressed related, you have been through a lot lately. but still go to the docs to confirm the results. a simple blood test will give you the answers you need.  i don't take much confidence in the home tests.  there not always accurate.  call the docs to get your labs.  have a blood test.  Good luck.|`|AA11481893	If you look at the box the test came in, it will tell you the percentage of how many work. They are not all 100 percent, but most are 97-99 percent accurate.  Best to go see the doctor, because if you're not pregnant, you need to see why you're not bleeding.|`|98369a8cabc8dc907c4faf7b7a31a206aa	Home tests or doctors tests??  Home tests all say to have a back up done by your doctor.    See your doctor and get checked out.  It could be false negatives or stress or something you haven't ever thought of.|`|AA11587746	Go ahead and go to the doctor and get a Quantitative beta-hcg blood test.  The amount of pregnancy hormone varies from woman to woman in each stage of pregnancy ... so sometimes peeing on the stick just doesn't cut it.  I had 2 negative urine tests before I got confirmation, and I'm 5 1/2 months pregnant now.  The blood test is for sure, and at least going to the doctor will calm your fears and let you know one way or another.|`|f67a3d78af7f40fc0fee7194267b32ddaa	don't worry, if you tried 3 different tests in 3 different days and they were negative- you aren't pregnant... anyhow, go to your doctor to check your health... maybe it just stress..  good luck|`|731220fae8767c87861713c0cad544d1aa	I would suggest going to see the doctor because if your pregnancy test changed to possitive that fast then you are probably pregnant.|`|3fd716ab194ce6c668a300314d6be37faa	all information you could ever want to know about pregnancy tests check out   http://www.peeonastick.com/  they even talk about brands and their accuracy rate and their false positive rates or faults negative rates.|`|e0e682b7757f5ff4b4bc4ad0beeee007aa	i took 3 test b4 i believed it but my first one took a while b4 it turned but ur best bet would be to see the doctor asap!!! cause even if u arent pregnant maybe they can tell u why u havent had the monthly and i just missed one month but in my case i am pregnant!!! if u are congrats a baby is a very special gift!!!!|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	They don't always work you should go to your doctor for sure.
10ead7b8e7d76a307156e2aed3f8b98aaa	Yes you could be pregnant. Yippy!!! for you and your man!!! The 'period' you had could be the implantation of the ovum into the wall of the uterus and this could cause the bleeding, I just thought - what if it is twins lol!!!|`|2d0d6c58ccc9359265c2888aafcbbce2aa	Okay I must correct one misconception and this is for every woman that has ever stated this, "You CANNOT have a period when you are pregnant!!!" Think about it logically, The baby embeds in the uterine lining.  What is your period?  It is the shedding of the uterine lining.  So how could you possibly shed your baby's lifeline and still be pregnant????  You can spot and it may seem as though your having a period but it's not.  Your baby is connected to your blood vessels so loss of blood (old) is not uncommon but it IS NOT a period.  As for your period being short this month, it is extremely normal to have longer or shorter cycles from time to time.  Mine are normally 4 - 6 good days.  Last month it was only 3 days and mostly just spotting.  TTC causes a lot of stress and stress can definitely delay or change your cycles.  If you spotted 2 weeks later then that was probably ovulation spotting.  If you believe that you achieved pregnancy at that time then you should wait and test until your period is 1 week late to ensure that your body has produced enough HCG to be detected.  Hope this helped and good luck TTC|`|d0bc24bfa7e23229460b39cd83fc04a9aa	this cud be a problem pl go see ur doc right away
AA11519759	Are you hoping to be pregnant? A Blood pregnancy test measures HCG the hormone that is produced when you are pregnant. A blood test would have determined that you were pregnant 1 day after conception and now we are in October going into November if you are pregnant by now you would've gotten a positive result. If you think that you are pregnant then you should request an ultrasound and if there's nothing on the ultrasound then you are definitely not pregnant.|`|10ead7b8e7d76a307156e2aed3f8b98aaa	Go and see a doctor, you may have an infection or you may be having a miscarraige, remember your health comes first at this stage

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	I wouldn't.      If the penis is underdeveloped, called "micropenis", it's STILL a baby boy.  If the vagina is overdeveloped, usually macroclitoris, it's STILL a baby girl.    In cases where the sex is really 'indeterminate' ... there are no openings, very little development, conflicting inner sex organs ... I would leave things in the genital area as they were, and do a blood test to determine what gender to raise the child as.      If they wanted to have surgery to make them conform to what's 'normal', that's a decision for THEM to make, not me.  I'd encourage them to decide whether surgery was right later on, maybe in the teens.    That is certainly what happens when doctors do surgery on babies' genitals and later find out that they picked the wrong sex.  People who honestly were BORN the wrong sex were exposed to the incorrect hormones while in the womb, making their brains develop to be closer to the opposite gender.|`|AA11226053	It is is almost always due to a "micro pennis"  in which case the dna is that of a boy but if steroids do not work he will never be able o have asex laife, so the parents are then given the choice...a very hard one|`|8cf073c8d02a950808d1b0b9467e41cfaa	you could have the chromosones checked & go with that result|`|217dcae0520846ca12d6c9d672a4a1fbaa	That is an interesting observation.

There have been so many people whose parents chose their sex and later on in life they are miserable. I would leave my child the way they are and when they get older let them make the decision themselves. As far as chromosomes go, you cant really distinguish by that either. There is sexually amiguous condition where a person is physically a male but has female chromosomes. And vice versa, a woman can be physically normal but have male chromosomes. It isnt common, but it does happen.|`|6dfad5b735f569c5a8844e84a5b55ea8aa	And the child was miserable their whole life. You can have a blood test or something to determine the gender.

Babies do not like the feeling of the water on there face due to the fact that they try to breath, and suck some of the water in. Also some babies try to keep their eyes open and the water in their eyes is uncomfortable.|`|1b2fa7bc49d8bb7c54e5cdd88ca4685eaa	do you like water poured over your head?|`|AA10297372	hey  he doesnt like it stop hurting him|`|c191a1db9947f5b3f34697b6f6d4543baa	I ALWAYS LET MY OWN KIDS POUR THE WATER OF THIER OWN HEADS AND THEN I WOULD DO SOMETHING OR SAY SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM LAUGH.

I would just move things around a little to wash and put them back.|`|e1fe6f13947922ae4d95bce3340f2344aa	when you are giving my baby a bath I always wash her hair first by just putting a little bit of water in the tub and then I add the soap to her hair and lay her down and then pour the water slowly over her head not getting it in her face. If you don't want to wash hair first then let water out of bath and then add a little bit of clean water in the bath and lay him or her down and wash it that way.  If that doesn't work use a damp wash cloth .  Also I tried sticking something up on the ceiling so they can look at it while you pour water on their head (make sure you don't get water or soap in their face.)|`|f52319ba0b3376c8c00a7f7c6c947dbdaa	I blow on my baby's face before I dump the water.  It makes them hold thier breath.  That is what I was taught in swimming class.  This way, they won't breath in any and gives them a warning it is coming.  Also, make sure the water isn't too hot.  You face is a little more sensitive then the rest of your body and if it was wet before his face will be "chilled" and the water will feel hotter than it really is. (like when you put warm water on cold cold hands, the water feels burning hot).|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Babies often don't like the feel of running water on thier faces and jump or cry when you pour water over their hair to rinse it...   I found blowing on my babies face so they close thier eyes just prior to pouring the water helped...      As my children grew older I gave them a wash cloth to hold over thier faces as i did the rinsing....  Most kids outgrow it by about age 3-4 as they begin doing alot more of thier own bathing...    My sister used a rubber ring crown thing to place around thier head seperating thier hair from thier face so she could wash thier hair with no water getting on thier faces...

Your best hope would be that all the sperm somehow died in that 15 mins and that she has totally miscalculated her ovulation dates. Her getting her ovulation dates wrong are way more likely that all the sperm being dead.  I would get away from her as fast as possible. If she isn't pregnant she will do anything to become pregnant.

I mean with antibiotics that could be a scary thing but if you told the doctor that you were on birth control and they still gave the medicine to you then i wouldn't worry that it would effect the efectiveness. And if you have already been on birth control for a while now, and the ring all of a sudden fell out i don't think you have anything to worry about. The hormone from the birth control is already in your system. So just from medicine and an accident you shouldn't have anything to worry about. But there is always a 1 in 30 chance of becoming pregnant from that. But i honestly don't think anything will happen.

At about that same time, I was no longer able to wear any of my normal clothes that didn't have either an elastic waist band or a very, very low rise.  I got away with wearing a couple of sizes up for a little while but had to give in and finally get maternity pants a couple of weeks ago (I'm at 20 weeks as of today).

I had no idea it was coming...it just happened.    The doctor had to break the rest of because it had only broke around the top part of the sac.    The most important thing is that you check to see if your water is clear and odorless.  If the fluid you see is brown or green, make sure you tell your doctor the colour when you call.

a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	If you do not chart or monitor your fertility in any way, and you think you may have conceived, you should wait 19 days (or longer) after having sex to test. Why 19?! Sperm can live approximately 5 days in the proper environment; if the sperm managed to live until you popped an egg, the actual conception could have taken place several days after the sex act that got the sperm there. To make sure you're not testing too early, assume the sperm had very long lives (5 days is considered a very long sperm life) and that conception occurred then. Then allow 14 days for the embryo to implant and develop enough hCG to show up on a pregnancy test (96% of pregnant women will test positive by then.)  http://www.peeonastick.com    Brown discharge is old blood.  Pregnancy Symptoms  Early Signs of Pregnancy   Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy; however, one of the most significant pregnancy symptoms is a delayed or missed menstrual cycle. Understanding pregnancy symptoms is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience pregnancy symptoms within a week of conception. For other women, symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy symptoms.    Implantation Bleeding:  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping.     Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.    Delay/Difference in Menstruation:  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period. This symptom is commonly explained by other reasons. If you have been sexually active and have missed a period, it is recommended that you take a test: Find a Free Testing Center or Order my pregnancy test    Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.    Swollen/Tender Breasts:  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen.     Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.    Fatigue/Tiredness:  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception.     Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.    Nausea/Morning Sickness:  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.

Backaches:  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.    Headaches:  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.    Frequent Urination:  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom.     Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.    Darkening of Areolas:  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker.     Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.    Food Cravings:  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.  http://www.americanpregnancy.com|`|99b688e76b75f46b8a5d14d59066d8b5aa	You must be pregnant!

Good luck.|`|e4854b021e6de946d10e59292a425b42aa	Sounds like it's a distinct possiblity.  Invest in a pregnancy test and check it out.
1c140a2168708b9527fa442e9ae67082aa	That is a huge stereotype, if you ask me.  Men who cheat like this are COWARDS and nothing else.  Oh, selfish.  I forgot to add selfish. :)|`|3EhoJ42zaa	well men who cheat on their girlfriends when they're pregnant, are not men at all.  And why say all men?  My man is not that way.  He has to be the sweetest most caring man alive.  I'm sure there are many other women who say the samething about their men.  Just quiet a few guys out there who are like that, but that's why you need to discuss having a child before getting intimate and make sure he has never cheated before and means well.  Trust me, all women can tell if their men are bad, it's just we refuse to believe it.  Good luck|`|AA11155768	These are men who will cheat anyway. They are only using the pregnancy as an excuse.|`|64972e0c2f444e729f2f59c633721d8eaa	I wish I knew. Mine cheated in a huge way and then even asked me to move out when I was 5 months pregnant. I haven't spoken to him since, and he hasn't even asked about the baby. I think in some ways, it's because they're just not ready for the responsibility of a baby, and try to cling to something that isn't responsible, ie cheating. But it still sucks.|`|11aef39e4836852ce90b8760353f1b60aa	I'VE NEVER DONE THAT, BUT IF YOU ASK ME IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A SUDDEN BREAK IN INTIMACY AND POSSIBLY OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR DURING THE NATURAL MOODYNESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN YOUR HORMONES ARE IN FLUX, IF I HAD TO GUESS. ITS BEEN KNOWN TO DRIVE A FEW OF US AWAY IN THE PAST.
AA11613544	No.  Many women experience "implantation bleeding", which indicates that she conceived.  Also, some women still have period-like bleeding early in their pregnancies, or even longer.  It just depends.  When in doubt, see a doc or clinic.|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	Any time sperm is involved, there is always the *possibility* of getting pregnant (especially if your cycle isn't regular).  If you got your period than it is most likely that you are not pregnant.  If you do not want to get pregnant, you need to ask your partner to use a condom with spermicide or you need to abstain from intercourse (he can ejaculate, just not in or near your vagina).|`|e49084a8c695191de51fa20957c89aaeaa	normally I would say yes but you never know. There is only one way to make sure 100% that you don't get pregnant and that is not to have sex.
AA10561400	NONE|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	No time is ''Safe"" Be protected always !!!!!  Precaution is better than cure !!!!!!!!!!|`|jR5kvXgeaa	none - there is a chance of getting an std and sperm can live for up to 7 days.|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	If you don't want to get pregnant, or possibly a disease, the answer is zero!  There is always the possibility of pregnancy with unprotected sex (tho some times of the month are less likely than others).|`|2LcyVsrlaa	Q: What do they call people who use the rhythm method?  A: PARENTS!    Also....AIDS, Hep B, Hep C, Herpes, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Crabs, Cervical cancer, PID, HPV, Trichomoniasis...and so on and so on...    If you are stupid enough to be having sex as a minor child and not using a condom, you are going to end up sick or pregnant.|`|AA10796300	you can do it any time but if u want to prevent pregnancy ALWAYS use a condom.|`|Z1EPM5jeaa	you should acctually always use a condom unless you are trying to get pregnant because there is always that risk of getting a STD|`|a2241d9e0f57b29fa67b98f6ffbf458baa	none, you cannot tell without a doctor to tell you by tests, when you arent fertile. its not for long either. dont do it. if you are sure he is std free you can get on the pill. have each person tested for an std, you NEVER know. you dont just get them from sex and not all guys tell you the whole truth. dont hae unprotected sex unless you are ready for a lifetime of baby-needs-you!! i did have unprotected sex thinking im invensible and only 3 months later i was pregnant.|`|Tx7mLg9Zaa	There's no such time as a safe time. You can get pregnant at any time of the month. Always use protection.
