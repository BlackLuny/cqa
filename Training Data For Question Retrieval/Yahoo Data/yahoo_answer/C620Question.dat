20090204225826AAWVBPr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal to get attached to the people you kiss?	I have had sex with only one person and got extremely attached to him. Since he and I broke up, I made out with a guy two nights in a row and now I really like him. The problem is that he is a manwhore and sleeps around so I guess there cant be anything there. How can I not think about him? I feel as attached to him as if we slept together or something but we only kissed. Is this weird?

20090204230140AAx5IgB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How come girls never make the first move?	Whenever I see girls starring at me during lectures/labs or across the hall or even in the elevators not one ever said hi or introduced themselves.   They always stare at me and every time I see that they are.       How come girls never make the first move?   This isn't just happening in college was high school too.      I'm willing to go up to them and say hi and introduce myself and maybe talk a little bit. But I just wait sometimes to see what the girl will do.
20090204230239AA4nFZE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies do you call guys who are ugly, and you're not interested in "nice guys"?	I'm confident, smart, funny, and charismatic. I treat ladies well other than the occasional teasing to have fun with them. I'm also not a pushover or doormat, and not afraid to say what's on my mind no matter how cute the girl is. However, sometimes girls have said you're nice, but... I know I'm not "too nice" so does that mean she's not interested in me cuz of my looks?

20090204230639AAO6CdK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is brief arm-to-arm rubbing a sign or just an accident?	i like this girl but i don't know if she likes me, but she's revealed enough to me that i can tell she doesn't have a boyfriend. we walk together to our cars until we separate to our own respective cars. and we reveal more and more about ourselves without the signs of attraction. on many occasions, outside of class when we're just waiting for class to start, i'm playing tricks on her and she laughs.    when we turn in our homework, and we have to wait in line to get it corrected, before we can leave, she looks at me for reassurance. and many times, i say, "well....we work together pretty well. i'm sure we'll do fine again this time."    and each time we're waiting to turn our homework in, we touch arms, and when we touch arms, my testosterone level just SOARS!. maybe it's just out of body position that we touch, or maybe it was an "accident", but i certainly enjoyed the touched.    what do you think?

20090204230524AAdbqGi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I have your opinion on a poem?	Good/bad feedback..suggestions? Thank you in advance!      When things go silent,   I find myself thinking of you.   When things go dark,   I see your face smiling at mine.   My heart races, but tears come to my eyes.      We are at a crossroad,   Deciding whether to stay or go.   We either give this everything we have,   Or we end it for good, close this chapter.      I don’t want to look back and regret,   Just like two years ago.   But I know myself,   And I know I will think about you   Even twenty years from now,   Wondering what could have happened.      I have to take the leap.   Open my heart, eyes, ears, and soul.   Experience the closeness I want to feel,   Like no one has ever given me.      Before, I ran away, moved away,   From anyone who got too close.   I was horribly afraid of opening up.   But now with you, I feel different.   I am ready to take a risk   And throw my reservations aside.      You think my opinions are strong,   They are.   What you don’t know?   That I am willing to put my beliefs aside   Just so that I can support yours.   To make this relationship work.      I know the hardship, I get it.   What relationship isn’t hard?   Religion is important to you,   It’s a part of you, a part I like.   You are passionate about your beliefs.   Why would I try to change that?      We aren’t married, we don’t have kids.   Why are you thinking so far ahead?   Stop living in the future, live in the moment.   I am right here waiting,   But I can’t wait forever.

20090204230607AAPSyb3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls do you do this too?	I seem to have noticed that whenever i stand i tend to bend my one leg a bit and keep the other straight, i mean i dont really stand like with both of my legs straight as it doesnt feel comfortable to me. Do all girls stand like that?    I wonder if i learnt this behavior somewhere or is it just me? because   it kinda looks like you are trying to be hot or like posing for something, but its very natural to me.    is it ok to do that.

20090204232444AAOtrJi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Aunt flirting again.?	I posted this not that long ago but now more has happened.         Anyway, I went on msn a few mins ago and my aunt began flirting with me again. She started telling me that her "husband " was asleep and she wanted to see me before she went to sleep. she kept telling me that she wants me to come over right now and "plow her" This is very weird for me because she's family, but in away i want to say yes. it was really awkward before when she started touching herself... but iwas aroused. She keeps asking if i want her like she wants me. This all happened out of the blew. I dont know why of all people she chose to like me, her family member, but she does, and i have to admit, i'm thinking about hooking up with her. but i dont know what the family would think, and i dont want to ruin her marriage either. she said she just wants to have a good time with me for now, till i'm legal and she can leave her husband for me. i know if she ever did that or told family about her feelings for me they would disown her, and possibly kill me( yeah, at least one of them probably would attack me) She sent me a video of her doing explicit things just a few mins ago. moaning my name in a low voice while her husband was sleeping. As of now, I'm somewhat interested in what she has to offer, but i'm nervous. She keeps saying how bad she wants me in the video. she said she'll be willing to do anything with me. I'm 100% i'm going to go for it now, but I'm just not sure when. Me and my mother happen to be staying over at her house tomorrow. she said she wants to wake up early before her husband and my mother so we can shower together... and then cook breakfast in lingerie for me, and then top it off by sleeping together in the kitchen before everybody wakes up. As much as this thought interests me, I'm scared to get caught. And i feel what we plan on doing is kind of wrong. What should I do? Be honest, guys, would you go for it? She's sort of abig women. but that's just more to love imo.

If a guy that you knew (not well but knew and talked to here and there) that you work with who you have a hunch likes you said this to you, how would you react: "Hey, (girls name) I know your gonna go off to college and all but there's something I like really need to let you know. I know were not like great friends and I wish I could have got to know you more, but I just wanted to let you know that ever since the first time I saw you, you've been the girl I thought about each day. Even if it were for a minute a day, I always thought of you. I haven't seen a girl as beautiful as you since I saw you and just needed to get it off my chest that since the beginning, I always wanted to be with you. It just like bothers me when I keep things in like that and I just wanted to let you know. Well good luck in college, I hope your happy and just know you deserve the best. Take care"         **I didn't tell her this yet, and it kills to not let her know how i feel      She knows i like her and she's a friend, im not a stranger. were just not best friends but were friends. i've talked to her before, y is it creepy

Do you ever wonder if some of the questions here are being asked by opposite parts of the same couple? If two of these questions aren't being asked about the same dispute, one by the guy one by the girl? That just occurred to me as I was going around; these questions start to blur together after a while, and I think it is entirely possible I could answer two questions about the same situation in one night and not notice . . .
20090204233207AAtJkQM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i ask if i can go along with them or do you think they would not want me there?	Ok, next week is our sports carnival right?   and there are these 2 girls who live near me. Im pretty good friends with them.      I want to arrive to the sports carnival with someone, instead of just myself cause i feel a bit lost and im not sure where to go and all that.      For the past couple of years they have had this kind of 'adventure' thing they call it and its just basically they have fun trying to get to the carnival. They were really excited about it when talking about it today on the bus.      I was thinking that maybe i could go along with them except im a bit too afraid to ask.   Normally i would be totally cool with asking except they make such a big deal over this thing its like their 'tradition' and they have done it for the past 2 or 3 years.      Im not trying to become part of their group or whatever i just need someone to go with.       How should i word the text to them? and do you reckon they would sy yes to me coming along??
20090204232425AAe81S8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I still fight for the girl... even if our first date just lasted 49 minutes?	okay, so this girl i dated ones... she had to leave early coz she gotta pick up her sister from some ballet class that got dismissed prematurely coz the instructor didnt show up.      anyway, after the date she texted me, telling me she had a great time xoxo. i responded that we should do it again and longer next time she said of course!      2 days after that, i texted her, she is still replying fast after several exchanges... i asked her out again. she said she'll be very busy that week. i responded and told her well, just let me know when you're free so we can hangout again. that's the last text, and she didnt reply since.      its been 2 weeks now, still no response from this girl, is she just waiting for me to ask her again? i left the ball on her court, but she seem to have just didnt play with it.      this girl is drop dead gorgeous, prolly that's the reason she doesn't really 'chase' men, i'm average looking myself, but im pretty sure she gave me a chance coz of our sorta good connection and my personality.       anyway, any advice would help... is this the end of us? or should i still have to fight for her? i really like her...
20090204232718AAkyPrz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	FOR F- SAKES! What;s wrong with me and how do I get out of this one alive?	Ok, basically, I'M TOO BIG A FLIRT!      I nomally don't get girls, but whenever I do get a girl to like me, a bunch more seem to hop on the train. Here's how it started...      I started out liking this girl on my bus, then I started getting like, 5 other people liking me.  went out with the girl on the bus for a few days, then I broke up with her to date this other girl. Then I was flirting with 2 other girls.       One just liked me and one was dating my friend, we started getting really close and we both let eachother see eachother... parts. She said she couldn't handle flirting with me cuz she love Vince. She said she was sorry for leading me on and we agreed to stop flirting.       THEN I started fliritng with the other one alot.. I ended up asking her out and I was STILL dating the second one.       Now today I was flirting with an ex that I've not talked to in a while. And whaddya know, I ended up asking her out. I am now dating 3 girls at once, this all happened within 1.5 weeks.       I don't like cheating but I can't help myself, I'm like the male version of a whore. The 3 girls are totally unrelated, but 2 of the girls talk to me on Myspace, so they'll figure out that I'm dating at leas one of the others eventually, this is 100% guaranteed going to end up in a whole ****-load of heartbreak. what do I do?????

20090204232519AA98lGo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does She Like me!? & What Do I Do Next From Here?	Okay, well first off I am a grade 12. And not until this year I have become really close with this girl, although we've never gone out. I mean close as in texting constantly, flirting at school, hanging out, and even on a few occasions alone. Before you think im in the friend zone for good realize I never made my move 1. she has never kissed anyone period/ever had a boyfriend (which makes me hesisitant) 2. my bestfriend liked her way before I did. This girl has a great sense of humor however she's can be anti-romantic (although can flirt/touch, etc) which im assuming is because of a lack of experience. However now that I asked her to graduation (prom) and she said yes, things are good and I will make my move if you guys think I should. I flirt with her much more then anyone else and she gives me more attention then she does to any other guys although she's definitly clever enough to show that I have her (if she does in fact like me/wants to start something) and she seems to always think i'm into her one friend - who i am also close with but there's nothing there (which i find out - she doesn't tell me). I feel the smaller the group (us and a couple, or just us) brings out the best in her but i just asked her to grad a week ago. Just asking her to hang out alone won't just make her think I don't like her friend and that I'm in to her cause she analyzes things negatively. Does she like me, and how could I find out forsure if she does/doesn't? & now that I've asked her to prom, what do I do from here? Please put as much input as you can, every idea/comment/suggestion is appreciated greatly. THANKS.

20090204232339AAFTI4X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i be the bigger person?	Me and my ex had a pretty messy break-up and have not talked since. He broke up with me. I now have a class with him. To make matters worse i don't have any friends in that class, while half the class is his friends. Usually we just ignore each other in the hallways and such, but when we are stuck in a class room i find it awkward. I know his friends know all about me. I have a few friends from his friends but they hang out with him so i can't really talk to them that much.      Should i be the bigger person and just talk to him? I don't want to seem needy or anything. I can't really make friends with the other students since they have their own little circle of friends and would just stare me down. I just don't know what to do. So far i have been the loner person just sitting by my self, but this so far it has been making me misarable. I have plenty of friends, but none are in my class.      Ps. Its a PE class.
20090204232441AAaUg84	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Friend with benefits with someone's boyfriend?	I met this guy almost three years ago, he wasn't in a relationship when we met, he and his girlfriend were broken up, so we started talking for about a two months, then he moved out of state and I told him I just wanted to be friends with him, eventually we ended up sleeping together and he got back with his long term girlfriend, and I stop sleeping with him, but anytime they broke up we ended up starting a friend with benefits fling, eventually they got back together again and the fling continued either through text messages or emails, this has been going on for almost 2 and 1/2 years now,he lives with his long term girlfriend now. I know it's a lust and physical thing, but I ended up catching some type of feelings, but I'm well aware that he would do the same thing to me if we hooked up. I want to walk away now, and not be a booty call, and at the same time we do have a good friendship and I don't want to ruin our friendship. I know it's wrong people so please keep your derogatory comments and negative comments to yourself.
20090204232506AAyN3SD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she have feelings for my guy?	Okay so my boyfriend and I have been together for a year now. We trust each other, dont get me wrong, there is just something that bugs me lately. He has a friend who is a girl, and they have been friends for awhile. They went out on one date right before him and I got involved, but they both agreed they were just friends afterwards. So I think this girl is really sweet and I like her but things seem kinda strange. She messages him ALL the time, and texts him quite a bit. Like a lot. They work together as well so they hang out a lot at work. I tried to look at it through another perspective. I had a best friend that is a guy, but I didnt message him that much. I dont think anything would ever hapen between them, not only does she have a boyfriend, but my guy loves me. I just would like to get another POV. Any opinions?

20090204232540AAdeoUh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My roommates don't like that my boyfriend spends the night, what should I do?	Hey everyone. I'm a Junior in College and so are my roommates. They're very innocent however and 2 of them have never had a boyfriend and the other one has but she hasn't ever done anything with him. I've known this guy for a while, 12+ years and we just recently started dating. He's been over 3 times since December and has spent the night every time. We don't even sleep in my room which I share with one of my roommates, we sleep in the living room. They just told me that they don't like him spending the night because they don't know him, my roommate doesnt like the smell of his cologne in our room (since it stays on my sheets after he leaves), and then they also say its kinda motherly in the sense that they don't want him to do anything to me.       Now I totally understand their mindset, but we are about to be 21 in a month or two. I want him to spend the night but I don't know how to tell them. Any advice?

I am in another university in the same state. He wants to come here to spent weekends with me. We already found a motel. But he just told me things might not work out, because he has to sign out and his dorm mom asked him to get his parent's approval call. I just felt upset. I don't know why there is such a ridiculous "policy" in the damn Christian university.

20090204233516AAGHO40	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help on a girl I have a huge crush on?	Im 15 and this girl i like is quite younger than me. She's grade eight and im grade nine. I have all academic classes with her, every other day. I also hang out with her and her friends during lunch. Her friends usually talks to me but she doesn't seem to be able to start a conversation with me. I used to talk to her a lot but as the days passed, I became more shy talking to her. I can't even make myself say comments like you look nice today. Whenever i make myself say those, I have second toughts. She asks me questions though, like what time is it or what is our math homework etc. but she doesn't ask me anything like how is your lunch or something or do you have a sibling. Her friends usually asks me those kind of questions (all girls). Also if she ask me a question it always starts with "Hey (then my name) (then the question). is this a sign that she doesn't like me?      Eye contact is quite weird. I see her staring at me then quickly stares at another guy. I know she is not the flirty-type. Maybe my eyes are just playing tricks cause i use my peripheral vision.      anyways, how can you tell if she likes me?      Other than that, i can't remember what to add anymore or i don't know what to write anymore.

20090205035937AAuvK19	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my x-friend mad at me for nothing?	My friend just suddenly exploded at me for no reason the other day, telling me I flirt with her boyfriend and have a poor personality. I didn't say anything back to her until I denied everything she said. I absolutely, positively, have never flirted with her boyfriend. She tried to apologize, but told me she had meant everything. And then she started blaming her actions on different things, like her Grandpa being sick. Next, she bombarded me with party invitations to "make up for it". I'm sick and tired of what she is doing, so I didn't go to the party. What do I do next?

20090205035130AAKCf21	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother-in-law is destroying our relationship?	My mother-in-law has a peculiar problem.She doesn't want me to have her SON be my husband. It goes like this...we,ie,  my husband and I are married for over a year now after we dated for 5 yrs. We dnt have any problem among ourselves but we are slowly moving away from one another because of my mother-in-law. Because of less space in my in-laws house my husband had bought a flat for us to stay after marriage, but we dnt get time for one another..the reason for this is...we have to go to my in-laws house every single day. If we dnt go for dinner for one day, my mother-in-law almost sobs in front of her son. This is becoming too much for me. I have been doing this for 1 whole yr. I had put up a question before with this problem and it was suggested by all the people who answered that we should slowly withdraw from our in-laws, slowly reduce the no. of days we go there, or tell we are too tired to go etc. I have tried every single possible way. My husband will never hurt his mother and he pressurises on me to adjust. I am sick and tired of adjusting. I love my husband and I know he loves me too. I also know he is in a big mess trying to please his mother and wife, but I am too disgusted of this setting and want to change my life. We both had decided that we wont go to our in-laws place every day but we will go there every week end, but my mother-in-law seems to be very cross with this settlement and complained to my mother that we are ignoring her. The worst part of this whole affair is we are slowly moving apart from one another, we have sex only once a week in the weekend as we both are working people and we find it hard to keep awake after a hard day of work. We come back home every day at 12 as my mother-in-law wants to sit and chat with her son every day. Please help me. I want a intelligent response to this which if I use in my life will not destroy any relationship but will solve this problem.

Last night, I came back to my house with my boyfriend after watching the replay of liverpool - everton...going off the point here. Anyway...the lights were still on downstairs and if my housemates are in they usually turn them off before they go to sleep for the night, so I assumed (stupidly) that they'd gone clubbing or something whilst I was gone.    The three other girls in the house are good friends...I'm just here to make up numbers for the rent but when I came downstairs in the morning one of my housemates was giving funny looks to another behind my back (I know because the other was confused and asked what she was on about). I don't know how to handle this!? I am so embarrassed...lol but I can't help it, although it wasn't that loud I could have been more quiet if I was aware...what would you do?

20090205043025AAWRvNV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Threesom friendship help! (please answer! 10 points!)?	Ok, get ready for a long explanation/story. So I have these 2 friends. let's call them friend 1 and friend 2. at the beginning of this year, we were all put in the same class. there was a problem though. apparently, none of our new teachers knew about what had happened a couple years ago (in a different grade). That was a horrible year. There was brattyness, peoples feelings were getting hurt, people telling secrets, and so on. So this year, at the beginning of this year, Friend 1 and Friend 2 and I were all "together" as if we were a clique or whatever you call it. (except MOST of us weren't mean). So going back a little bit, me and Friend 1 were BFFL'S last summer. we would constantly get together, have sleepovers, and life was awesome. (except for tons of fighting we would do) friend 2 would still hang out with me; but rarely. But, me and friend 1 noticed that towards the middle of the year, we started noticing that friend 2 wasn't really what we thought she was. (well at first she was nice but we assume she learned SOME of the bad behavior from us. and our experience with fighting from the summer). So whenever we would get in fights (all of us) 2 of us would always gang up on the other one. usually the other one was friend 2 and me and friend 1 were a "team"). But suddenly, me and friend 1 came in to school one day with matching shirts (exactly the same). after that day, friend 2 kept CONSTANTLY copying us. our style, our phrases, our ANSWERS, EVERYTHING!! so now, it's really awkward and SOO ANNOYING because friend 1 and I really don't like her but problem is is that she's in our class..so it' can be hard to avoid her. we probably will both still have an "in school" relationship with her until we get out of the same class together, but what am i supposed to do? (if you didn't catch it, friend 2 is the one i'm asking about, she's the mean one) Friend 2 is bratty, she can't make decisions for herself (she asks for our opinion first), and she says stuff behind people's back! For example, she recently had a "get together" with one of her new friends. well yesterday, her new friend and my other friend were explaining something to the class, and afterwards friend 2 said something really mean about her new friend. to make it easier for you awesome guys to answer this tough question, here are the main 3 things i'm wondering: 1. Why does she copy EVERYTHING about us and how can we tell her to stop? 2. Do you think she's jealous of me and friend 1? how can i explain that to her? and 3. are there any good combacks for when she says something mean? thanks SO much you guys! and this isn't the whole story, the whole story would take up a bunch of room. hope you guys can answer the questions! THANKS!

20090205042720AAR8oyw	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Im so scared about my wedding! Its traditional punjabi and I have no idea what to expect! HELP!!!?	My bf proposed recently and Im so happy, but its just occurred to me that his family and him expect there to be a fullscale Sihk punjabi wedding back in india (he's indian, Im australian).  We're young, and we cant afford to have a wedding here in aus and another in india. The flights and gifts for everyone will send us broke even if his family payed for the actual wedding.    I always had this dream for a simple, elegant small scale wedding. Im not big on being the centre of attention so much, and I always imagined just close friends and family, and a really beautiful, personal ceremony. I come from a pretty modern kind of family too, and Im not overly fussed with tradition, and I am not especially religious.    But in India his family is big, and well known so the wedding could easily be 300+ people, it will be like 5 days of celebration, lots of religion, lots of ancient traditions and nothing 'understated' about it.  And worst of all, these people are all strangers to me! Iv never met them because Iv never been to india to visit any of them before. Iv been studying. Maybe my mother and little sister will fly to india to be there, but my friends are students or just starting work, and the rest of my family probably dont have the financial means to fly across the world for a week. Im going to be basically alone. Traditionally I wont be with my fiance before the ceremony, and we definately wont be alone  together at all with so many people around.    What the hell am I suppose to do? Im petrified of being alone and in india with strangers. I dont spek the language and I really dont understand lots of the traditions. Im so stressed Im going to offend someone accidently.  How am I going to enjoy my wedding at all? And how can my dream wedding compete with thousands of years tradition and the expectation of an entire family...and culture???

20090205042658AAv6mFP	Family & Relationships;Family	Can my husband's niece keep him from visiting his dying mother?	My husband's mom is dying from cancer. She didn't want the entire burden to fall upon my husband so she split family duties 3 ways. Our niece was assigned to make health care decisions and my husband and nephew will be the co-executors when his mom passes on. Our niece and nephew, who have ingratiated themselves into my mother-in-law's life, have kept us from knowing that she was in the final stages of her life. There is much family history of disagreements, but my husband and his mom have kept in regular touch and frequently visited, along with our children and me, until the past few weeks and have a loving relationship. His mom has a history of getting angry and not speaking to various family members for weeks at a time. She didn't speak to her own sister for over 10 years and there have been times when she wouldn't speak to her daughter (who passed away 6 years ago) or our niece. Everyone has had their turn being in the doghouse.       From what we can figure out, she told the rest of the family that my husband didn't love her anymore and that we never called or visited her, even though we shared holidays, dinners, shopping, laughter, and regular visits, etc and had what we thought, a good, loving relationship. I guess she did this to get them to come see her more often and feel sorry for her. And they evidently believed her and see my husband as an unfeeling monster.      Now that we know she is near death, our niece is refusing to let us see his mom, and her husband called the police on us when we came to visit and told lies that my husband was dangerous and had violently threatened them and probably would kill his mom. It was absolutely surreal to have police suddenly enter his mom's bedroom, hands on their guns, and see my husband, who has never laid a hand on anyone in his life, be strong-armed, his arm wrenched up behind his back, and marched out of the bedroom. This was after they asked him to come with them and he agreed calmly and was walking peacefully from the room. We had no idea that they had been called and told these lies until later. My husband did have a few moments with his mom to say farewell before this atrocity occurred. They even were able to laugh together and share good memories. But he will forever remember this time as being violated by these relatives and 6 police officers who thought he was a violent criminal, based on lies.       Anyway, we are not sure how to protect ourselves from further attacks and lies by these family members. We will probably not even know when his mom actually passes on. They are refusing to provide us with the names of his mom's attorney and they are camped out in her house, along with the hospice care workers. We had asked her for this information during discussions about what her wishes for her care and final arrangements, but she always said she would give the information later. She never got around to it. We have no way of finding out about her condition. What are my husband's rights and how can we protect ourselves from these evil vultures who are only interested in his mom's money?  We are not the least interested in her money as we both have good paying jobs, savings, and investments. All we have ever wanted was to share our lives and love with her. My husband is heartbroken over this whole situation and we have no idea what to expect. At this point, he does not want to try to visit his mom, because he's afraid that the police will be called again and it will be too upsetting to his mom. Her mind is just fine and she was alarmed at officers suddenly appearing in her bedroom. My husband doesn't want that for his mother and doesn't want a confrontation with the other family members. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
20090205042721AAtMbXz	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do about my friend?	A few months ago, I dyed my hair from blonde to midnight black. I realised that it went really well with the particular eye colour I have (a silvery blue) and when the dye finally washed out, I decided to have it dyed black permanently. My friend got some contacts a few weeks back a similar shade to my own eye colour. This week, she dyed her hair black like mine. The reason I decided to go for the new look was to be original (there's a lot of imitation around where I live). I really don't mind her taking hints and tips for herself, but I think it would be better for her to adopt her own style and be original. I don't know what to do about this, as I don't really like confrontation and don't see why I should have to think up a new look.   This may seem like a really shallow question but I don't want any obscenities or anything.   Thanks xx

20090205045306AAddJzR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I deal with this - I always have to bargain with her to see her!?	Sorry - a bit of a ramble   i've been with my gf for over four years now. I managed to pursuade her to live with me at uni and we had two great years being with each a lot, sharing our lives etc.    After uni, we both moved back to our parents for a little while. She is still there, but I moved out with a friend in to a a flat. I really wanted to live with my gf again, but she refused saying that she wanted to save up some more money/sort a job out etc. I was upset by this (she had a job, albeit not her dream one - and had enough money to move out) but I also kind of understood her position so respected it.   Now I have to share her with her mum all the time! She never comes to my flat without some pursuasion. And if she does come here, then there's always a time limit. E.g. she has to leave by 6 on a sunday.   I just feel that since we are both mid-twenties, both in jobs, and have been together for a serious amount of time, why does it still have to be like this!   I feel like i'm constantly having to wait around for her.   What do you think? Am i in the wrong? Should she be a little more willing to spend time with me? Is there a compromise we should meet?   It's really getting me down.

20090205044134AAFcZKi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do men manage to do so well for themselves?	I live in a condo. The family next door have two daughters. One grew  up, went away to study, came back in a year and got married. She  brought her new husband to live with her parents. The parents just  redecorated it, and their condo is like a new expensive pin. The new husband is about 23-24, huge, 6'6, well fed, with every fist the size  of a football. She is pregnant now, with a big belly, he does not work. She works, and I saw her in the evening dragging big bags of groceries home, to cook him a meal. He lounge around, watch their new  expensive plasma TV, plays music, invites numerous friends, who  shout, smoke near my door, in all the times of day and night. Sometimes they finish as late as 1 a.m. He discusses life and  philosophises. He does not work, apparently, because he did not find  THAT job. The jobs that were offered to him were all beneath him.  When he finds that perfect job, with little hours and a good pay, where they would appreciate his genius, he would work hard. He does not do any chores, too, because it's not a manly thing to do. Meanwhile, he has good free lodgings, free tasty food, sex, everything cleaned and washed, entertainment, friends and so on. And he goes around as if these people OWE him, and if he did a huge heroic deed when he married. I just thought that if I married and moved with in-laws and did nothing at all, just ate, watched TV, played music and invited my friends in, I would have been out if a week, if not quicker. But men manage to pull it off and enjoy themselves. How do they do it? What is the secret?

I know it was my fault that it started because I did not want to pick up a mess that my siblings made that I keep having to do. Long story short, Both my mom and dad said things that really hurt and I did the same. I cried while we were fighting and for 2 hours afterward. I manage to pick up what they wanted and cleaned my room in record timing and then I cried some more on my bed which led me to fall asleep. I woke up two hours later and stayed up till 3 am. I feel so bad so bad and I m hurting in the inside and I dont know what hurts more, the things they said to me or the things I said to them. I hurt both of them but I had hurt  my dad more.

20090205044930AAhdJWC	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I over-reacting and being jealous/possessive?	My partner and I have been together for just under a year now, I love him very much and know he feels the same. Before we met he fell for a girl who chose another man instead of him which left him very hurt. Since then they have remained very close friends and this girl is still currently with the other man that she chose. My problem is that they used to text each other continuesly, I mean 20+ times a day, nothing flirtatious that I know of though. This bothered me, we argued over it and the texts calmed down to just a few. She always turns to him when she has a problem, it's always a very serious problem aswell, such as Cancer, splitting up with partner, ill parent/s. I just can't seem to believe all this as there are no signs of cemotheraphy, no days off work, and after a serious operation you would expect that!! I feel she is lying to get the attention of my boyfriend, whos always goes running to help. I don't feel they are completly over each other, and I feel threatened by this. I have asked for the contact to stop, which I know is alot to ask, this hasn't happened but 'she will stay away' for a while to give me a break. I just can't stand this bond they have as I really feel it's not healthy, for my boyfriends feelings aswell as my own. I feel like I am competing with this 3rd party in my relationship and have worked myself up so I now feel very jealous. But am I right to feel this?? HELP!! Thanks

Have been married for 12 wonderful years.  My mother has never approved of my husband or the fact that we have 5 children.  All of which she has seemed to grown to love after arguing with me while I was pregnant with each and everyone of them.  Telling me how bad of a choice I made.  We raise our kids on our own live on our own she just thinks its to many kids.  My husband and I wanted 6.  So we are pregnant again! YAY!! My mother and I live in different sides of the country but she will be here on vacation this Friday and I haven't told her I am pregnant because I wasn't in the mood for the negativity.  Well needless to say I am huge as I am due in May and would attempt to avoid her but its almost impossible as she will be staying not to far from my home.  A friend of mine gave me the advice to hide it from her (stress full) My husband says grow up its our lives (then I have to hear what a failure I am and how can I love another child and I don't have enough time in my day blah blah blah balh) then I was thinking to call or email her and tell her to deal with it.  What would you do god I feed like a 13 y/o she has always had this effect on me.  We aren't close about anything!!! She is like my judge and Jury! Please no wise @ss comments.  I need help!

My fiance said he would like to go somewhere different to make it special but as we are paying for some of the wedding and building a house, I think we would be better taking the barbados trip.   What do you think??

I know she's not a lesbian and she never will, but i really want to talk to her or just want her to notice me (the popular doesn't hang out with the nerd), SO, in the Halloween prom in my school, I disguised as a boy (since i'm a tomboy and i'm tall and have low voice, acting like a guy is pretty easy to me) and ask her for a dance in the prom (all students wear mask so she doesn't recognize me). So we dance and talk alot, we had a really good time, then she asked me my name, i said "i'm a big fan of you", after that, we dance one more time and she didn't ask me about my name again.the next day, i heard a rumor that "she likes some guy that danced with her at the prom". I don't want her to wasting her time and feeling into some dream charming handsome prince, and that "prince" is actually a girl.    I have a friend, he and i were best friend since we were 12. Now, he suddenly walk up and says  "I know you dance with her last week, and i'm gonna tell everybody. YOu damn lesbian running around fooling people."    I don't know what to do, i now have to obey everything he say otherwise he's gonna reveal my secret . What should i do??????:???????????????      please help me ! thanks you guys a lot

This is after a pregnancy in our relationship in the past, WHERE HE LEFT ME! I was hurt, alone and scared. My step-mum died, and I had a mental break down. The doctor advised I abort for my health. (I already have a son, and it was for his sake too. I wasn't recovering and he needed me)    After all this, we a year later got back together. Recently after much talking and even counselling, he said "lets try for a baby"    It took alot for me to do this, but I agreed. I so want another baby.    He cheated on me with a work colleague when we were trying. I found out... WE are broken up. I emailed her and told her everything, and she DOESNT CARE! THEY ARE STILL SEEING EACH OTHER!    I am devastated, hurt, and feel humiliated and like a fool. Please help...

20090205061033AA6JEyu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do some women detest a guy who wants to marry a virgin women?	I was recently engaged to a young attractive woman. We both are 25.      After a couple of dates I found out from one of her friends that she lost her virginity to her ex bf at 15 and that she still sees him sometime.      When I confronted her about this she said "It's no big deal. He is just a friend". We could not come to terms with our relationship and some differences and so we both walked away.(No dumping)   Later she and some of her friends started posting facebook comments and that I am a loser who wants to marry a virgin and a bunch of lies.      I myself am a virgin and I believe it is better to not marry someone that lacked patience and dedication to wait till marriage.      What is your opinion?   ps: No bashing please, if women can be really picky and demanding why cant men be a little demanding.

20090205064026AA22TvL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you guys think about open marriage. After 20 years, would you let your woman or man have a fling?	What do you guys think about open marriage. After 20 years, would you let your woman or man have a fling? Would you allow a sexual encounter on the side to explore? I know everyone will start saying its cheating, but a lot of people cheat and the other person never knows and marriages continue because it was just sex, a release that needed to happen. It doesn't mean the person loves the other person less.       Its just if the couple let each other do it...maybe once or twice in their life time/ in their marriage, there wouldn't be as much divorce?      Yes, cheating is bad and I don't like it either, at all, but it happens, we have to accept it and it is both for men and woman.       What do you guys think?      Plus, when you're in the later stages of life, does cheating mean less or more after a long marriage?       I just want to know what people think!      Thank you!

20090205061640AAmwb40	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Valentine's Day, my bf made plans to work for Fashion Week, he wants me to meet him there in NYC. Should I go?	The thing is we were supposed to go TOGETHER to NYC for an art show and he was supposed to just hang out with me on his birthday which is two days before.  He will be busy volunteering at Fashion week on 2/14 and 2/16 etc.  This is a big opportunity for him to make other connections he needs for his career so like I dont want to ***** about it but I really wanted this time to be about us not him working for once! He is trying to get a job with Ann Taylor in NYC also as well.      I guess I just thought he could have told me sooner, granted our plans were not formally made but still I told him like a month ago how I never had a good Valentine's day before so basically if I do not meet him in NYC, I wont really get to celebrate in all honesty.  The next day he wont be working but he will be in NYC for the next few days! I have his gifts he says he doesnt like the gifts lumped together with his bday and V-Day but he will leave for NYC on his bday 2/12 so wtf I have no other choice.  I am confused. Please help.  What can I do to make both parties happy? My bro lives in NYC btw so I could stay with him assuming I bring warm blankets, sheets etc. Its a bit of a hassle getting there though by myself at that.  Costs Money which I lack. I live in central NJ.  I would need $30 for train fare/subway $$ for food etc.  I figure if I go out there I might as well do some networking myself

20090205061402AAJEj63	Family & Relationships;Weddings	If you not going to the wedding- how much should you send to them?	I was looking at her registry but everything is so expensive for $25- I could send one mug or salad plate- when Macy's is having a sale.   I wanted to buy something because I didn't want to send check because I can't spend too much and didn't want to look cheap.      How much would you spend- it's my husbands step sister- he wasn't raised with her or anything so it's not like it's his sister.  Their parents just go married basically- and neither of them lived with that parent.

Without boring you to death with the whole story, My Father bought a building and has gradually turned it into a retail center with a huge variaty of goods to buy, from clothes, kitchenware, outdoor sports to a coffee shop its massive. The problem is with it being a new business we have to keep costs down, which means understaffing the place.   I am the Manager and look after everything from the admin to the ordering and genral running of the place, I am covering at least eight to ten peoples jobs.   The problem is that I am only doing the jobs to 50% of what they should be done, I am getting myself into a state, Its just becoming to much for me and is consuming my life.   I have suffered from depression for many years and just recently I broke down and have been signed off sick, I am crying at the drop of a hat and am suffering from terrible pannic attacks, Im sick and my head is in a mess...   Its a family business and I feel I cant let them down I dont think that anyone els would do my job on the money on offer.    Do I put my health first or stick it out and try and just see how things go ? I feel desperate right now and totaly lost ..

He talks too much that it gets on everybody nerves. yesterday this woman told him to hush, and to stop talking. I was talking quietly to the girl next to me about drawing , and he asked us "why did you guys not invited me in the conversations"? We both looked at him funny. She said "we are talking about drawing" he said "why did you guy not invited me in though? i understand why is he so annoying. He likes butting in to other people's conversations. Augusta talks to the guy next to him about whatever and Dave will try to get in that conversation with them. Augusta just looked at him in a mean way. Is Dave looking for attention?
20090205062002AAczlsd	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Donating money in lieu of wedding favors?	My fiance and I were discussing wedding favors. I've been to plenty of weddings were the favors were just either left behind or thrown away once you got home. I don't won't to waste money on something that people don't care about. So, we thought about donating money. I lost my father 5 yrs. ago to Brain Cancer and my fiancé's aunt was recently diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. I've been reading about donation online and it's been mixed feelings. Some say its good while others say no. Has anyone ever done this at there wedding? Or any advice to give to me? Also ACS has a scroll they can print out to give to the guests to tell them about the donation but its pricey, anyone have suggestions on how to let the guest know what you have done? Thanks so much :))

Last year I met this dude - things weren't going well with my my husband so I really flirted with this guy made him c um a few times with this and thats how I managed to wrap him around my finger.      Time moved on I said how I would like him to ***** me and how I had already thought about it without him there time moves on and we get closer and what do you know I tell him I love him - seeing I dont love that fearful husband of mine.      Thats when I stopped communicating with him ha ha ha ha, he tried a few times to get back into contact and I said I was busy lol obviously I wasnt but he didnt know that, its been several months now and the guy has made many efforts to contact me lol and I know the lapdog will be there when I finally get out of this nightmare of a marriage cos I can just whistle and call him by the petname I used which often made him c um.      Sure I've distanced myself from him not replied to anything hes sent but I feel guilty and have regrets about this all I of course used the line that I would never see his life rejected and sh!t.

Okay, so my boyfriend goes and stops at this girls hair shop all the time he calls her and talks about her a lot.

I felt rather awkward. But he never thinks nothing about it and that I should be okay with it but he would never think it is okay if I would do that! If he goes to a party and I don't go this girl is always all up on him in all the party pictures. And not to help matter she does have a reputation as a go around-er. But my boyfriend gets mad if I say something about her. I just don't know what to make of all this!

I met my bf on Okut and thats how our relation started.He lives in my city,is of my caste and loves me alot.So do I.We trust each other and plan to get married too.He seems to be very serious abt me.   He is Graduating from Mumbai while I am a student in Delhi.   Actually he is really very handsome and got all gorgeous girls (models) in the past.I am not that good looking though I am good natured.      The PROBLEM is that my ELDER brother says not to be serious about him.And I am crazy abt my guy.My brother says not to trust him so much coz we met in Orkut and we are in a long distance relationship so maybe he is going out with some other girl there and we have been in relationship for just a few months and I trust him as if we've been together for years.Bro even says that guys just make gfz to F*** them and then leave them.He says that i am very kiddish, a bit immature and very emotional and that my bf knows that I am very emotional so he says all those senti things and i am impressed by that and then i start worshipping my guy.      Now i am feeling a bit insecure.I trust him even now bt when i think abt all that my bro said I'm scared if all that he is saying is right my trust would be broken and i would be shattered.      But my heart says that my bf genuinely is a wonderful person and loves me.   And I love him alot.         I have met the guy.......he is genuinely nice....he met my friends,my cousins and my mumma too.....came to my house also.   he was on leave for two months...we met practically every day and had a gala tym together      But I respect my brother and love him too.I have always followed what ever he has said till now.      What should I do?   Do I believe my brother and be suspicious abt my bf?    or   DO i trust and have faith in my bf like i've always had?      Should I tell my bf what ever my bro said to me?      i

The reason was she kept me in dark for two years regarding her pre mariatal relationship with a married guy. I could not trust her anymore and broke up.   May be she really loves me but i cant trust her more.What all lies can she tell in future and also a doubt that if she has pre marital she can also have extra mariatal relations.   And if i cant trust her even if i accept her back we wont live a fruitful life and our future wud be ruined.   She is forcing me to be back. She is not eating properly, neither cpncentrating on studies and acting as if she has lost all hopes.She does not have a father.   What i did to her was because of her mistake.   But if it affects her future i would be feeling guilty.   help me!!

20090205060204AAGt8pj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would marriage help with custody battle?	My girlfriend and I were friends for years and while she was in a short relationship she became pregnant after 1 month.  She kept the baby and we started dating while she was pregnant and the other guy was too busy having a good time with his buddies to help her out through it all, although he wanted to be a dad, he didnt want to show any responsibility to prove he would be a good one.    Now my girlfriends baby, Natalie, is 7 months old and the father wants to gain some custody of her, but neither of us want that... at all... he moves from place to place constantly(its his way of not being homeless), goes out playing poker and drinking often, I dont even think he would wake up to a baby screaming if he were alseep.  We're both scared he will get a lot of custody and horrible things will happen.   Question:  If my girlfriend and I got married now (rather than the one more year we were going to wait) would that help our chances at all? It may be too soon, we know, but we both feel it would be better than the alternative by leaps and bounds.  Ive been there for Natalie since day one, and ive known my girlfriend for years since before all this. Please give us some advice if you can.. Much thanks!!

20090205053623AAW0x5X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you forget about a lover?	I don't really want to forget him... I loved him for years, since I was 9. I still do but he doesn't love me. He's not even bothered to talk to me anymore. We used to be best friends. Neither of us could live without the other. But one time I left him for a month with no reason whatsoever, I don't know what was up with me then... And after that, it seemed like we didn't even know each other anymore! We began to drift apart more and more until he just stopped talking to me. But I still love him. I never stopped loving him. I know it's my fault but I don't know what to do. I stay up at night thinking about him, I walk around thinking about him, I just can't seem to let go. I'm usually optimistic, I know I'm too big to cry. But he was the one who saved me from myself time and time again, he was my life. I still keep whatever that has to do with him, I look at him each time I see him, it's like I don't want to let go! I don't want to forget him, I want to continue loving him, but I think it would be better for both of us if I just let go. It's been almost a year since he stopped talking to me. I need to let go but I have no idea how. Advice please?

20090205061046AA6zkg8	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do in this situation?	I recently met a person who is still in uni, and she kept telling me how bad she's doing in some of her classes. I did okay in uni, so I'm not really sure what to say. I tried to be positive but she kept saying that its more complicated and she won't tell me why. So basically, my question is what do I do when someone is talking about their bad grades and expect me to say something comforting? WHAT DO I SAY??? also, what if they turn to you and ask how you did? if you did better, do you lie or tell them the truth? sometimes when I tell the truth, they get defensive and feel that they can't relate anymore. so what do i do? I want to help but I want to make sure I don't hurt them more or insult them.
20090205055635AAJYjva	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would a chronic unfaithful liar have to be desperate to get 'fixed up' & go to Cambodia to bring back a wife?	My ex is my ex for one reason; He was always lying, and always promising to quit his lies. He lives with his mom at age 37, who also raises his kids. For a few months we dated, (I was only seeing him) while he professed his 'love' to me, even though I kept safe, and kept my heart closed off due to his lying, and a few months back I decided to move on, dating other people, and told him so. I am a honest person, so I always told the truth, even though I felt it didn't matter as most of what he told me was a lie. He got me a cat when we first met, as a gift (Which I have a signed paper saying it is MY cat) and so I let him still come around, bringing me cat food, etc... His jealousy and insecurity were painfully obvious though, and has been another reason for me to back away. Recently he came around, saying he missed me and wanted to see me again, and I got weak and let him come over. Then I found out by accident he is letting a customer's Cambodian wife fix him up with her relative, who lives in Cambodia and speaks no English. He lied to me (of course) but finally admitted that he is going to Cambodia, and that she is a younger virgin, bla bla bla... I knew he was dating, as I have been dating too, but something about this makes me sick. Maybe the people just want to get their relative over here, if so he is being used for that, maybe he just wants a submissive woman to do his cooking and cleaning and everything. Even his own Mom (who he lives with) said she wants nothing to do with this woman. I am moving on, of course, but this just really made me sick... I know he probably thinks he is getting the cake and gonna eat it too, it just makes me see him as weak and desperate. I guess any Sally Smith or Jenny Jones down the street won't date him for long either, seeing as he can't tell the truth if his life depended on it.

20090205060235AAbAS5o	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My wife stays home sick from work for smallest things.....?	My wife has the habit of staying home sick if she has the slightest stomach ache or does not feel up to par.  For the past 2 years she has burned through her vacation because she has stayed home here and there for no reason.  If kids have a day off from school for "presidents day" or some other holiday she wants to take off.  Thus resulting in her having no time left at work to take for family days or vacation.  She also has a hard time making it to work in the morning on time, she cannot seem to get up out of bed on time even though she is going to bed early.  How do I help motivate her?  How do I tell her that we all go to work with a stomach ache or if we feel under par and that we just fight through it?  I dont want her to use all her vacation so we can do stuff as a family?  What do I do?
20090205060538AAD52nM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm very against marijuana.My fiance' smoked 4 times since we r together & he knows how I feel.  What do I do?	I don't want that in my life, and when I told him that the first time he respected that and said that its not important to him.  He has since moved in and we are getting married in 2 weeks.  He found some marijuana in my freezer that belonged to a friend of mine.  He smoked it and no longer took me seriously when I said that I don't want that in my life.  Then he smoked the other day and I said that we cant get married anymore.  NOW he is taking me seriously and now he says he will never do that again.  Can I trust and believe him again?  Am I over reacting to say that if he still wants to get married then we will have to go to counseling?  I don't want to risk him not taking me seriously again!  I love him very much and he is very upset that he has hurt me so much.  Can I forgive him?  Or would that be stupid?

20090205064705AAYVWLL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I even say anything?	Not long after we got married his ex started calling him and stirring up those old emotions. Playing the "ex games" as I call it. I couldn't believe he'd be that stupid because she is quite the mess (several children from different dads since their divorce 8 years ago) but he really seemed hooked.  I was pretty sure I was out the door like yesterdays garbage and she would be quickly moving right in. That seemed to be her strategy and it was going quite well it seemed. (She is the mother of his child and he was madly in love with her-she ran off with another man etc so "to a very small point" i understood.)  A few weeks ago out of the blue she slammed him with extra child support and bills.  The look on his face..he could barely talk and I had to leave the room b/c I was laughing so hard.  Since then they do not talk at all and he seems to be coming around and is constantly telling me what a wonderful wife and person I am and he is so grateful.  Should I even bother saying anything to him? I think the lesson was learned...??

20090205062205AA9xnYz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Daddy Drama -- Advice Please?!?!?	Hey everyone, I am posting this in hopes that I can make my ex-roommate and good friend (amanda) feel a little better.  Amanda has a 5 month old son with her exboyfriend, Jason. They were only together for 3 months when they found out that she was pregnant. They were both living away at college, which happened to be his home town. He packed up everything in order to follow her back home to be with her family. Her parents offered to let them stay in their house for as long as it took for them to get their feet on the ground. Their son was born and is now 5 months old. In late January, Jason told Amanda that he was leaving her. It was a complete shock to her. She never saw it coming and was really confused. He told her that he was depressed and that he wanted to make things work but he just needed to be away from her for a while. Amanda expressed to me that Jason suffers from depression, just like his father (who is a manic depressive) and she believed that maybe he had just hit a low and just needed some time away from her. She said everything else in their life was normal before hand (they still had a sexual life, he told her that he loved her, and he was a fantastic father...everything seemed normal when he dropped this on her). He promised to go see a therapist for his depression and told her that he wanted to be with her, and thought that maybe since they were together for only 3 months before they were pregnant, he felt they didn't get to know each other. He moved out, and moved in with a friend and then only came over to see his son about 2 times a week. Amanada was upset by this, since their son was very attatched to his father and she could tell his mood and attitude was changing. So about a week or so later, Amanda finds out that Jason is going on a date with some girl he met. He also told her that he changed his mind and he didn't want to see a therapist. Last night he told her that he didn't want to be in her life anymore, but he wants to be in his sons. He said that he doesn't love her, and that he had found someone new. While all this was going on she found out that he had taken out 3 credit cards in her name (how he got her info...we are unsure...they were living together so I am sure that it is possible) and that he had racked up debt in her name.   She wants to move on, and get past this. I was just wondering if anyone else has been in a similiar situation and what you did to resolve things...or at least make things better. I am just being supportive and trying to be there for her. Does anyone have any advice for her? I don't know what to tell her.... Thanks!

OK so i have been engaged to this wonderful guy for 5 months now and we have been together 4 years prior. and his brother recently got engaged.

20090205062531AA11K62	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is my friend avoiding me?	It seems as though everytime i ask a question nowadays its about this particular friend...      Ok, yesterday he wasn't in the best of moods and when i asked him what was wrong he started to tell me...trouble is he couldn't talk for long because we had a lesson to go to.   I tried again later but again we were interupted due to the very short journey between lessons.   Today we are off school due to the snow, so i decided to text him to let him know that i'm here for him if he feels down again and he said he appreciated it.   I then asked him if he wanted to come round my house for a bit...he said he needed to stay at home to look after the 'little uns' i.e his brother and sister who are 15 and 12.   I just text him to go on msn to ask him to help me with something, as soon as he helped me he said 'ok g2g the little uns need feeding'      I may be being naive but 15 and 12 year olds can be left in the house alone for a few hours and even get themselves something to eat.   I've met his brother and sister and both are more responsible than they should be at their age.      So what do you think, is he trying to avoid me? Maybe he thinks i know too much about him and i'll think bad of him?

20090205063149AAApIB8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has my boyfriend fallen out of love with me?	I've been debating lately if I should stay in this relationship that I am in. I've been with my boyfriend since Oct. 2005, and we had a daughter in Nov. 2007. I think he's fallen out of love with me a while back.. and now I believe it's causing me to fall out of love with him also.      Last year, for my birthday in Oct. and Christmas he didn't get me one single gift. Not a big one nor a small one. Just absolutely nothing! I bought him something for both. I bought him a nice jacket for his birthday a year ago and he's NOT wore it once.       I stayed home for 2 years with my oldest child and while I was pregnant and after my youngest was born. During that time he worked and supported the family. However, during that time he wouldn't take care of me as in making sure I had money or the things I needed. Like my car battery died. He kept saying he'd get me another one. The car sat out in my front yard for 6 months. I ending up buying my own battery saving up money here and there people gave me for my birthday.      I wanted to go back to work after I had my baby and he didn't like that idea. Every time I mentioned it, he would get mad and start screaming "Go! Go! If thats what you want to do then!!" I ended up going back to work when my youngest was a year old. I also was working on getting my degree online, but I ended up having to quit cuz of some pregnancy problems. I've not yet went back and every time I talk about going back to school, he gets all mad and says I don't have time for it. He doesn't seem to be supportive of anything I want to do to better my life.       And I don't know if this is normal after being together for 3 years, but he shows like no affection towards me. He never wants to cuddle & be close to one another. His kisses are awful. It's like a fake kiss. No meaning in his kisses. And getting intimate with one another is almost nonexistent. He's always too tired, not in the mood or busy watching tv. Sex once a month is pathetic.      So, are these all signs telling me that my relationship is basically over? That he's no longer in love with me? I am so depressed right now. I just don't know what to do. I'm afraid that if I do break up with him, it's going to come back and slap me in the face.

She then proceeded to say I owed her some old debt of $160 and on and on. She doesnt feel like I need the money but I do..I need to be able to move next weekend.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 year almost and it just doesn't feel the same anymore. I understand that he comes from a low income household and he's busy with academics and wrestling afterschool, but is it alrgiht for him to not even plan anything out for our 1st year anniversary? I've always accepted the other monthsaries when he didn't give me anything most of the time because of the money issue, but couldn't he at least make up something inexpensive/sentimental/surprising for once? Am I being greedy? I just need some answers. I planned out a movie and dinner for our 1st year and I asked him if he was doing anything on that same day and he said "No, it's your plans. You can take me anywhere." (well, it was along those lines) I felt like I am the gift-giving/mastermind of surprises/ the guy of the relationship while I'm spoiling him every single monthsary and now it leads to a 1 year anniversary :( helpp.
20090205064237AAdqIig	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are my options in court for my ex marrying me while he was still married to another woman?	I married an american in Georgia May 2003 before returning to Australia where I worked as a youth worker on good income. I gave up my job and the car I purchased outright 16 months later when my visa was approved. A week after arriving here I found my husbands divorce papers from his first wife which were dated November  2005. I was devastated and confronted him but was given a BS story. For the next 2 years I tried hard to make it work because I had nothing to turn back to as I had given up my secure life in Australia and was completely without money and resources. I just had nobody to help me. Eventually the drinking and drug taking was more than I could bare and I gave up my low paying job in accounts because I was physically and mentally exhausted dealing with a bad relationship with an alcoholic. I asked for a divorce and he put me through hell and i had to flee to my daughters house. All the promises he made to pay off debt and mutually share assets were pure lies. I have no car, no assets and nothing but debt with no way to pay it. Meanwhie he taunts me and laughs at me after he just bought a bar and restaurant.The marriage was not legal in the first place so does the divorce decree stand? Can I take him to court for bringing me here on false pretenses? I am absolutely destitute and have no money for an attorney. I do not know the law system in this country or where to find answers.

20090205083622AANMJRC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's your opinion on Marriage at 18?	I love this boy. We are both 17. We are well off. I will still be in school though after i turn 18. I don't want to get married right after i turn 18, i just don't want to still be in school. also i don't wanna get married at 18 and end up pregnant and in school still. He wants to get married asap. i want to wait a while. i know i want to be with him i just don't know if 18 is such a good age. what is your opinion on the age ... you could pursue me. idk. i want to make him happy. it really doesn't matter to me i just don't want to get pregnant. and i don't believe in birth control either. i think its a form of preventing a baby... just like abortion almost but that is a different story. so... got any advice on how long we should wait or not wait. We have been together for 2 years. so its kinda like high school sweet hearts. but im so scared of change and divorce (my parents were miserable for 18 years then finally got a divorce but all the kids were dragged into it and well it was just horrible) i just don't want that to happen i mean i guess there isn't much preventing that but ugh... just plz make me feel better.             points are available for You!
20090205080712AAXP6lS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to convey to my fiancee clearly and without being mean that my boobs are not toys?	I love my fiancee, I adore him and we have an amazing time together.   I love having sex with him and while in bed I like it when he handles the ladies. But out of it it annoys me to no end!!!      We can be watching friends in the couch and he start squeezing or prodding or flicking my nipples and while I love him and find him attractive this IS NOT a turn on. I tried to explain to him how annoying it is, I tried doing it to him and he admitted it annoyed him and I explain clearly that it feels the same way as if he sat down and flicked my nose through an entire episode of Lost.      Short of cutting off his f*cking hands (which I am sorely tempted to do) I dont know what else to do to make him understand that MY boobs are that.. MINE and they are not TOYS and more importantly NOT HIS TOYS to play around as if they a stress ball or putty to handle when he is bored... what do I do?! Is really getting on my nerves.

20090205085411AAyadxQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can we take this further?	I met this really nice guy. I like him alot. We have great conversations. He is brilliant. I have feelings for him, and he says he has them for me. His close friends are a group of women who are very vocal about the fact they do not like me. They disagree with my point of view on topics that do not involve my relationship with this man...and frankly are none of their business. He is aware of my feelings and agrees with me completely.   We can't spend time together where they might see us because they can be very catty and try to pick fights. I could care less about their rantings and threats...but it makes him uncomfortable. He says he has spoken to them about it. They don't show him the respect of dropping it. So now...when we hang out it is alone and in secret. I don't like it. I respect his friendship. I don't want to interfere or make things uncomfortable between them. I may not like these girls but he does, so I was willing to play nice. I promise (for me at least) jealousy is not an issue. I have mostly male friends myself. There is nothing wrong with it and if any of them were to come to me, in protest or concern about him I would listen to their opinion. I would likely follow their advice, but...men are protectors. They look out for me. I realize they don't need a woman to fight their battles. And, they realize humiliating me by attacking someone I am with is immature. I would never ask him to chose...but by keeping me a secret from them...hasn't he?

20090205083635AAlsvYW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think my ex husband has a problem?	He tracks my questions and answers and even answers my questions. He contacts me on a regular basis to argue about who was right or wrong in our divorce even though its been over a year and I've remarried. I think his behavior is odd, obsessive and even disturbing. He finally started seeing a counselor (yesterday was his first session) and first thing this morning he has to IM me to tell me what his counselor said. I told him bluntly that I do not care about what she said, nor do I want to hear about it at any point and time. I have asked him to leave me alone, but he doesn't seem to get it. I have tried blocking him on here, but for some reason he is still able to answer my questions. He doesn't call me or come to my home, but yet he still finds ways to make contact. Any ideas?

20090205071940AAqrT9p	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it okay to buy a smaller carot diamond at first?	Im in the market for an engagement ring for my  soon to be fiance but i had originally wanted to buy ,like a 1.5 carat or 2 carat .(us guys we feel more macho or feel we are not worthy if we don't give our girls a big rock or stone) i know that is just a myth but its how we feel . (i know that if she loves me she would love whatever i get her!      so my question is if i bought like  3/4 or 0.76  carat or .7 or .8 carat or 1 carat       a much smaller diamond opposed to a 1.5 or larger carat at first then upgrade later to something bigger closer to the wedding or a anniversary i was thinking of getting something like this first:          http://www.mondera.com/Diamond/diamondpr...          or this one       http://www.mondera.com/Diamond/diamondpr...          so again my question is ,is this common for guys to buy a smaller stone for an engagement ring but then maybe by the time the wedding rolls around to trade in for a larger stone (just make sure the setting can accommodate for a larger stone)      let me know thanks

20090205073620AAsrg6X	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is is rude to not want to be a part of mass text fwds?	Would it be considered 'childish', 'dumb', or 'teenager-like' (this is what I was told) to not want to receive obnoxious text messages from a friends husband?      I have a friend who's husband sends out mass fwd text messages. I have only gotten 2 and even when I received the 1st one (about a month ago) I texted back, 'please don't send me these texts'. Last night I got another text. So I called my friend and we talked for a little bit about what's going on in life and what not, then I mentioned the text I got and if she could tell her husband to please not send me texts like that. She was totally offended and said I was being childish and it's 'only a text message, what's the big deal?'. I asked what the big deal is of just leaving my number out on those mass fwds. to which I was told 'I was looking into it too much'.......I was being very nice about everything and said, 'I thought I would call and be civil to just ask if he could omit my number from the mass fwd list, that's all.' She was so offended that she hung up on me. Honestly I don't get e mails or texts any other time from her husband, but does that mean I have to change my number just to get it to stop or just keep sucking it up when I don't want to get them? And I can't block his number or I would have.       She is emotionally unstable and I am really the only person who ever was a true friend to her. Should I just leave it be or what? I mean what is the big deal with asking not to get texts like that anymore?

Son? (under 21 but 18+)    If you are part of the specified couple, what do you think your parents would think? (considering you're in the age group above) what about your friends? how long would you wait before telling people you met online?

I was doing a scan on my laptop a few days ago and a keylogger popped up. I was so upset, I thought somehow a hacker or something got in and was stealing my credit card numbers and social security, passwords...   My boyfriend walked in the room and I said "someone put a keylogger on my computer!" I didn't even suspect him, but the GUILTY face gave it away...      He told me a few months ago (We've been together for 1.5 yrs) he was feeling paranoid- but couldn't remember why- and he put it on- but never checked it...      I didn't know how to feel about it- today I am basically "over" it, but I don't know- invasion of privacy or a "right" as he put it....???

20090205081452AAC7n10	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How many married couples have played this little game?	Ok- I thought it would be fun and cute to have my wife dress very sexy; next, we would go to a popular singles bar, but separately. We'd pretend we don't know each other and I would watch as other guys tried (unsuccessfully) to pick her up. Eventually I'd step in and chat her up; we'd talk and flirt, maybe even kiss; then I'd take her home with me.      If you're married and have played this game, how did it go? It sounds really fun!  I'm a little concerned I might not like seeing other men hit on my wife; but otherwise I like the idea.
20090205072740AAd3ojU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys...........is he trying to hurt me???????????????	i was dating this guy for a month and he then confessed to meeting another girl when he was on vacation two weeks ago who he likes more but they live in different countries but if it wasnt for her he'd make me his gf and he doesnt want a relationship. i told him i felt  mislead cuz he was very respectful of me the way a guy acts when he really likes a girl. i'm glad he was honest and didn't play me but i told him i am hurt and dont want to hang anymore. he then clarified that he thinks i'm sweet and cool and he wanted to remain frendz. so i said alrite thinking that we'd never speak again, move on in a way you know but have no hard feelings. a week later after nothing he calls asking if we're still cool i said yes because i was already getting over it. i mean we just dated. then he said he made the other girl his gf. so they are long distance. why would he say that. he then asked if we could still hang out as buds cuz he thinks i'm cool and very easy to talk to. so i said yes. but it still bugs me a bit. he's a christian like me we're both virgins so he wouldnt "use" me i know but is he trying to make me jealous or does he genuinely want to be my friend. Why does he still wanna hang out, i'd think if he has a gf he's forget about me? someone plze explain.

His vechicle is down right now so I am thought it would be nice to allow him to use my car to seek new employment. Well, I called shortly after he dropped me off so I could remind him to take my car payment to the bank (I gave him the check this morning) and I asked where they were (he has our daughter with him, he said he was picking up his brother b/c his borther wanted him to take him somewhere. 1. His borther has is own car, 2. What if my daughter's dad was at work, I'm sure he would drive himself.       Situation 2. I may not be with my daughter's dad or anything like that but he talks to his brother's baby mama everyday via text message (it could be harmless) but I've heard of those stories of brothers sleeping with their brothers mates. Just the thought of it, ugh.      My family thinks I am really hard on my daughter's dad and should give him another chance. We've been through a storm and back but right not I need some space from it all. Have I allowed my helping him get in the way?      Thank you for your suggestions.

My hubby always asks me to masturbate for him because he likes watching, but the thing is I don't masturbate like porn stars do where they look all sexy; before we got married when I wanted to get off I'd hump this little pillow I have and it felt really good!

When I first came, she reminded me that I was unemployed every single day. She always tells me that I need her for food, shelter, etc. She says I don't appreciate her and I can't survive without her.      Well I was offered a job to teach English in Japan, and I'll have to live there for a year. One of the things I had to submit were my transcripts, so I was waiting for them in the mail. They were taking a VERY long time to come, and then I found my transcripts hidden in my mother's bedroom! She's keeping them from me so I can't go live in Japan!      If she wants me to be an adult and independent so badly, why is she trying to keep me here? Should I tell her I found my transcripts in her room? I left them there and I've been asking her if she got them in the mail, and she always says no.

20090205071146AAA7ozh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm lost here. What would YOU do?	There's this guy. And about a year ago, we met at a football party. He seemed really interested in me, and he gave me his number and told me to call him at the end of the night.   I never called him (Because I'm a chicken. x] ) But he had added me on Myspace, so we messaged each other ALOT. Eventually he sent me a message that said "PLEASE call me. I'm dying over here."    So I did, and we hit it off so well. We ended up talking 24/7...and he asked me out.   I turned him down, mostly because I thought I was in love with someone else. He mentioned again months later, and I rejected him once more.   Now, a year later, we've started talking again. I just saw for the first time in a year about one month ago. And man...he looks good.   I've thought about him everyday for the back 13 months. I've liked him for so long...but now that I have the oppurtunity to talk to him, and become his friend again, I don't know if I should. He hangs out with another girl alot now, and it intimidates me. Should I ignore him? Should I call him? We only text now. Should I become his really good friend again, or should I just jump the gun? What would you do? Help me!

I graduated high school early to get a jump start at college AND just to get away from an abusive (verbal and physical) father. There's really no turning back to go to back to high school. College is right around the corner for me. I could stay at home but i just can't stand the abuse and depression he brings. Everything is negative to him it's not doing good for my image, mental health, social life ect. He'll call me down from my room at 2am in lecture or b*tch at me for a few hours...really sucks with sleep since i don't get to sleep until 12 usually anyways and then have to be up around 7 am sometime 8. But, with all the economy stuff going around...would moving actually be worth it? Or should I just stick it through for about 3 more years...which, all the "hell" would continue until I'm moved out...he is a scary man lol the cops don't even dissagree with him very much :( wasn't home at 11..oh god did the police bring me home, ugh! embarassing!! So, just wanted some opinions...   thanks   just for added info: I'm going to college..well, yah, for law enforcement, not really sure what branch i'll take though, have about 2 months to really decide before i start lol. But, when i was younger wanted to do cosmetology....spent A LOT of time with my aunt who is a cosmetologist, so, that was a HUGE influence..so, idk, might even somehow work that in and do that for a lil bit of time, go back and forth between the two or something lol but, idk, getting mixed remarks of weather it's a horrible choice or good choice you know..but, thats not the issue here lol
20090205065752AA9GxSq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it possible to come back from the point of no return in a unhappy marriage?	My husband and I have been married for 7 years and we have had problems since the beginning of our marriage. He was emotionally abusive and neglected our marriage for the most part. I believe in the vows I took before god and this is why I'm  having such a hard time dealing with my emotions. My spouse doesn't know how to communicate and has never tried to work with me on our marriage problems over the years. I have begged him to work with me but he ignored every concern I ever had and told me I was turning into a nagging wife.      Now after being strong through his abuse, late night drinking bengs, him going to school, raising two young babies on my own I'm done. I told him I wasn't in love with him and I wasn't sure if I ever could again. We have been ghost to each other the past month and I don't know what to do. I am in college full-time and a stay a home mom. I want my marriage to work because of my feelings towards divorce but I don't know if there is hope. I feel so lost and my spouse seems to somewhat trying to help us but he still doesn't communicate with me. He does this love me attention crap that makes it more frustrating. He'll lay on me in bed or try to hold my hand and I just want to smack him...Please what do I do I am still young in my late 20's with two young children under 8.

20090205072839AAqa9Ar	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Boyfriend pressures into sex?	I have a boyfriend i known him for quite some time . Both of us are Christians. My boyfriend used to pressure me into sex in the past that's kind of why me and him broke up in the past but now he was begging me to come back to him because he loves me and he said he won't ask me for sex no more so I decided to give him another chance.   However now things changed again and he told me that it's just for now that he won't ask me for sex and if i don't do it with him he will cheat on me. He is a Christian and he said he knows it's a sin and all but then he keeps asking why am I being selfish and won't have sex with him. He said humans are not perfect and they sin.   I really don't want to have sex although I'm not a virgin .. but that was my mistake in the past and I learned my lesson and I gave up sex but my boyfriend just won't understand it. I'm only 16 I could get pregnant, I could really mess up my life.   I don't know what to do about this, could some mature, older and more experienced Christians give me some advice please?   thank you. People who are going to be immature don't bother.

20090205065751AASQ741	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be worried that my fiance continues to hang around certain people?	Ok, here's the story.  She moved back from SC 1 year ago.  She had some old friends that she hasn't had contact with in almost 4 years.  These were her best friends growing up.  These 2 friends have been involved with meth and other shady behavior.  My fiance has 3 kids and is a teacher at the local elementary school.  I told her my concerns about hanging out with certain people and even though I trust her not to do anything crazy I don't trust that they won't put her in a dangerous or risky situation.  She went out with one of these girls a few months back and ended up spending the night at a guys house with her friend.  Her friend drove and ended going over there for a booty call, or so I heard.  My fiance also said one of his friends was all over her and forced her pants down (this was a totally different issue) then she said her friend intervened and had sex with him to satisfy him and he would leave my fiance alone.  Maybe I just have a shred of doubt in my mind.  Maybe some trust issues with what happened last time.  We talked about it and she openly told me about this a few months after the fact.  I just hope i'm not being naive.

If the one person you devoted all you're time to told you that you make them feel like shyt?   if the one person who you felt was the only one there for you, deserted you?   the one who you fell madly for, left you to fall.      and now, you're sitting here writing this question, for everyone, and anyone to answer, becuase you don't know exactly waht to feel.      Should I hate the person? I feel like shooting them.   For putting me through all this, and then at the end, saying sorry, like that'll fix all the problems in the world. For telling me to leave them alone, and then saying later on, they'd find me.      I should of stopped after their frist mistake. I should of never put effort into it.    Becuase now, now i feel like , like a *****' cat that feels like she has one life left.         this is not really a question, more like a vent. but you can try to answer :]
20090205082641AAdJGhQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Child Custody Case , I need your Help?	I had a strong case against my son mom for child custody. The judge ordered us to go to investigations based upon the allegations we made against eachother.However, the investigator said he would give my son to me based upon the allegations and proof I had. Anyhow, the investigator mentioned to me that maybe I should work things out with my sons mom before our next court date (3 months later) Because if we did work things out we can drop all cases against each other, being she wanted full custody and I wanted joint.       So I took his advice and worked things out with her.In fact I lived with her during those three months and even put her and her daughter on my medical and dental insurance. I paid for the food, my son’s diapers and pretty much everything. I paid for her other car to be fixed so i can drive it to work.       Anyhow 3 months later come court date; she was my ride. We were both getting ready in the morning at her apartment. As I was getting my son ready she decided to leave with out me. We were supposed to drive to court together. And go into court explaining we had worked things out so everything can be dropped.  But no, she left me behind and I did not make it to court. In fact I walked outside locking the door holding my son, and she was gone. We waited 3 hours before she came back outside, because we did not have any keys.       Therefore, the judge ordered me pay 2500 dollars of her attorney cost, and now I only get to see my son every other weekend for only 2 days. She left me behind, and didn't even wait for me. Now if i want to submit my allegations against her i cannot go through investigations, I have to go through Child Protectve Services.          She lied to me and played me obviously. I did not want to take my son from her, I really loved her and wanted to make things work, but she had other bad intentions.       Anyhow what can I do, I was fighting this alone and initially I had a strong case but now in the eyes of the court I’m a dead beat dad. That is not the case, I love my son and tried working things out with the mom. What can I do, how should I approach this. How long do I have to appeal??? Any advice would be great.       Thank You
20090205074102AAKnHxf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can we help the people we love most?	I refer to those people who suffer from any disease. How powerful is the moral support in such cases?   Here's a case: My grandmother suffers from physical diseases, which have caused her mind problems. there's a long time now and she feels like stranger among the others, often cries and shouts. She's very sensitive, because she hasn't any contact with the outside world. She can't walk on her own feet.   Do you think that the best way to make her feel better for a few is not to remind her the bright past that she had?

I find it so hard most days to get through the day.       I love both girls dearly and no I'm not depressed, I just feel like all day I'm saying, no not there, pick that up, tidy away, don't scream shout, etc etc!  They aren't the naughtiest of girls and are quite normal its just I feel like I want to be on my own sometimes (quietly!)

20090205070647AAC8uMm	Family & Relationships;Family	Looking for unique ideas for Valentines Day for kids, husband. Help?	Hi!       A little history. I am married with 4 kids and looking for ideas for a unique and hopefully not too expensive Valentines Day gift for everyone.      What would you get or do for a husband of almost 29 years? We've already gotten each other just about everything imaginable. We really don't need anything in particular, and what we do need, we can't afford (A new bed! Ours hasn't been updated since we got married. Lol) We already have dogs, cats, fish. He has a ton of dvd's, cd's, clothes.. etc.     We have two little girls. One is 10(11 in May) and one is 5(6 in July). I was looking for ideas on unique gifts/ideas to give them for Valentines Day. My 10 year old is in the between stage, not mature enough for the big girl teen things, but doesn't want the lil kid things either. The younger one will be fairly easy.       I also have two boys. The 27 year old is married and gave me two adorable grandbabies ages 5 and almost 2. Do I do something for everyone seperately? Do I buy him and her one gift to share and seperate the kids? Do I just get a big 'family' kind of gift? Or would that be considered tacky?       My other son is 24 and single. He's easy to buy for. So I have ideas there.. but I am lost on everyone else.       Valentines Day was never really big in our family growing up, but now that I have my own family, I always try to do something special for every day that I can. Holiday or not. But I'd really like to make this one memorable.       So anyone have any advice? Let me know. Thanks! =)

20090205074036AADMYFS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think she was hung up on this guy from the beginning?	Before my ex and I got married she did inform me there was another guy that wanted to marry her.  She told me he wasn't an issue because he couldn't provide for her and her kids.  She accepted my ring and pushed to get the marriage license however at the last minute she backed out of wanting to get married.  Do you think this was to show the other guy here is a guy that will step up to the plate?  We ended up getting married and she would still go back to her hometown to run into him instead of spending time with me.  This guy apparently made some changes and she left me and married him.  Did I have any chance or was I a way to get this other guy to step up to the plate or just to get what she needed for a short period of time?

20090205065316AAH2xKL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i text him again, or would i look clingy?	Hes a proper LOVELY guy, hes deffintley not a player. We been speaking on facebook quite alot and hes shown interest in me :) like saying sweet things ,and hes said im really pretty and says things like 'hopefully il see you soon'      Ive spoke to him in person 2 times, first time was ok, we bumped into each othr at the bus stop.      weve started texting each other but i ALWAYS have to text first (i even had to ask for his number), its so annoying. He texts back, and seems interested and happy to speak to me hes quite flirty on texts aswell. He takes a while to reply sometimes .. but thats boys for you.      I needed to pick something up from his college earlier this week, so i asked him if i could catch the bus with him, so i met him at the bus stop in the morning. we got on SO well. we was making each other laugh, had a good chat .. was really nice :)      I want to ask him to go cinema, or something for next week. but how do i do it?      I always text him first i dont want him to think im needy or being pushy, but i really like him and i dont want him to go off me or find someone else. I dont want to ring him i HATE speaking on the phone.      Do you think i should text him like   'hey how are you? what you doing this weekend etc etc.   and then on the next text ask him if he wants to do soemthing next week like cinema or something?      oorrrr .. im thinking he may not want to go cinema becuase it would be like a date, and he seems quite shy and may be put off .. or just want to get to know me as a person first.   so i could ask him if he wants to meet me after college or something and he can come get my piercing done with me if he wants?      If he likes me he should say yes right? even if hes shy?   if he says no, or makes an excuse, he doesnt like me ?      and if doesnt reply, i get the picture.
20090205065555AAZXRSs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why did she get so pissed off at me?	My long term exgirlfriend and I split up one year ago, when she dumped me (I was overseas on work for a few months) via the phone and married some other guy, some ex of hers 5 months later. It hurt so bad, and still does. I still dont know what happened, she later told me she thougth i had no intentions of marrying her (we were together 3 years) and she got desperate. I tried to get her back when she split with me, but she never changed her mind.      I was cleaning out my closet and found so many things of hers that she left with me, stuff like cosmetics, books,etc Instead of just throwing them in the trash, I was still so upset and sad, I decided to mail them to her parents house (I dont know her address). I didnt mail flowers, just her old possessions.      The next day, she called my 2 best friends on the phone (she didnt call me) and they told me she was so pissed off at me, that I should have just trashed them, etc. Then her sister called me as well, yelling me, etc. I was the one who was DUMPED in a terrible way when she married someone else, I NEVER called her since she was married (but she called me several times) and never mailed her anything before. I was too upset to even talk to her (but she called me and emailed various times since she got married) Why was she so angry? She is married to some other, why even care what I did? ONe year after her marriage, why? I still feel terrible over this, it is too hard to describe. I do love her, and wish I didnt but I do.

My grandfather is currently in a local hospital to get his medications adjusted. The doctors have recommended placing him in a nursing home after his stay at the hospital.  He is unable to care for himself and it is a family affair to see to his daily needs.  My grandmother is still alive and they have a home on about one acre of land.  The both recieve Social Security and are on Medicare, not medicaid.  Someone has convinced my grandmother that if we place him in the nursing home medicare will come in after he dies and seize her home and land.  I wouldn't think they would take the home with her still living there.  Is it possible for one of the family members to purchase this home to protect it from this?  Thanks!

I am seen as the enemy and I am at a complete loss as to how, or if,  I can do anything.

We've known each other for years and have been living together for a year and a half although I put him out last summer because he didn't have a job and I suspected him of cheating.   We messed around while broken up but barely two months ago he asked to come back home so we could try again.  Maybe foolishly I let him because I suspect he's been cheating already.

He's already stayed out all night once & he comes home at 3,4, or 5 in the morning at least twice a week & sometimes he'll disappear for 2 hrs or so and not answer my calls & when he calls me back he just says he's on his way back home.  We're good friends but he says I'm becoming too possessive & I nag him alot.  But he has his freedom and does what he wants.  His childish behavior is driving me crazy.

20090205075447AA6IETZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I trust that my boyfriend isn't doing anything innapropriate with his female friend?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 7 months.  He has a 4-year-old son (never married), has always claimed to be open and honest with me because we've both been cheated on in the past and both have insecurity issues.  He says he would never do anything to jeoporadize what they have, particularly because of his son.      He went to college late, so everyone was significantly younger than him (he is 31.)  He had a close female friend who he was in study groups with, she used to watch his son for him (when he was a baby), and she was married the entire time they have known each other (she is now 23.)  She had been in the military, and called him back in the Fall to tell him that she is getting divorced (she was in St. Louis at the time, we live in PA.)  He went outside to talk to her, claiming that he was respecting her privacy because he didn't think she would want me hearing her personal details about the divorce.  She knows that he has a girlfriend, because they are friends on Myspace.  For some unknown reason (I swore I would never be this girl), I looked at his phone a few weeks ago and saw texts back and forth between them, one of which included her saying "I stopped by your house but you weren't there." (he stays with me the weeks he doesn't have his son.)  I confessed that I looked at the phone, which he was obviously and rightfully angry about, and he said that's just how she is, she's just that friend who stops in and that's what she used to do back when they were in college.  At this point, he said she was only in the area temporarily before going back into the military.  She stopped by again one night when I wasn't at his house, and he allegedly told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with that (since I've never met her and wasn't there) and asked her to leave.  He told me that she never said anything to him about coming over that night, she just stopped in.      We are on a family cell phone plan, so I can see both of our lines.  When our cell bill came out, I looked at that particular night and they had texted back and forth AND she had called him about 20 minutes before she stopped by.  Questioned him about it, he said she never said anything about coming over, and was of course angry that I looked and was being untrusting.  Well, I looked at the rest of the phone bill and it appears that they call/text each other pretty frequently.  The calls aren't for very long, and he claims they are about him helping her find a job, because now she is staying in the area for good.  I looked back through the historical phone bills and it looks like they've been doing this for quite awhile....what particularly bothers me is that they were texting at 1 am one night that he was out drinking with a friend (he did come home to me that night.)  It also looks like they've had this texting/calling relationship while he's dated other girls seriously too.  Now that he knows I can see the phone bill (when he first realized that I could see it since we're on the same cell plan, he got freaked out for a second then said, "it doesn't matter, I have nothing to hide"), I'm suspicious that they're messaging on Myspace (I will see him online, then go off, then she gets online....guessing he's sending her a msg, she gets an e-mail notification, then goes online to read it.)  When we talked on the phone last night, he told me that she had texted him that morning, but neglected to say that he was on the phone with her when I called.      I'm not sure what to think.  I know I have trust issues from past relationships, so I don't know if it's that or if my gut is trying to tell me something.  He tells me that I need to trust HIM, and that even if she would cross the line, I need to trust that he wouldn't let it happen.  I feel like she's being disrespectful of the fact that he has a girlfriend, but I don't want to be that girl who asks that he end the friendship.  She is only 23, so maybe it isn't even crossing her mind that she's being inappropriate.  Any thoughts?
20090205073009AAOu1iB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I write my husband's girlfriend a letter?	We are going thru a divorce but he still comes over sometimes and we have sex. I think she should know. I do enjoy the feeling of taking him away from her and being the other woman. I know you will all tell me I shouldn't have sex with the ex but it's seriously exhilarating for me to be the other woman. I feel like I am doing the same thing to her as she did to me. She knew the whole time he was married. He also has another thing coming in this divorce so don't think that he is getting away with anything.
20090205073657AAbnAdM	Family & Relationships;Family	Problems with In-laws... don't even know where to start...?	Me and my boyfriend been together for like a year now.. there were problems, consequences... plenty of them.. and now we are finally together and a few months ago i was involved with family ceremony and that's how it starts.. at first i thought it's a good start to hang out with in-laws so than i could feel secured and get to know them.. first couple of weeks i was struggling and i finally got thier attention that i was there.. and i thought i was getting along with almost all of his folks well... i have to say i'm asian.. and my boyfriend's family is kinda highclass royalty.. so i tried to fit in so hard.. and that could be the problem.. because i didnt know who i was anymore.. In that world, people are incredibly manipulative, persuasive, phony... and you have to be one of them or out.. and then when i realise that this is nonsense.. so i stoped and tried to be me again.. the real me..  and that's how the big problem kick in..    His sister's friends are incredibly rude.. and one of them yelled at me the other day about the door... and i was so upset so i told my boyfriend and he's a great guy he's always there for me so he kinda told them off then his sister is mad at him and also not talking to me.. that's one..   the other day i did a concert in province ( I am an MC ) so when about to start to show i was asking the director of the program for the Video CD because i want to watch with my boyfriend.. and he said it's not allowed too... so i kinda mention his name's boss ( which is my boyfriend's sister in-law) but i did mention in a good way.. i believe this is what i said "That's ok then.. I can ask my boyfriend to ask his sister inlaw.. thanks" i said in a nice way i believe.. and that guy went straight away to the sister in law and told them stuffs.. which i'm not really sure what that is and this is what i've been told that i said to that guy in time " You should give it to me or i could just go and ask from your boss my self " and now she's mad at me.. my boyfriend's been trying to compromise this issue but i believe she's not interested. and she wont talk to me...      Maybe it was my fault? Maybe I've come out from the wrong foot? Maybe i dont fit in? Maybe i don't belong there?       Should i be that phony manipulative girl like them? or do it my way and got mistreated?       PS. I'm not rich and i'm really poor.. my point is i'm nothin like them at all..

I discovered this and he admitted it.  He uses this account to join facebook groups that have adult content and pictures of half dressed/skimpy dressed girls.  He said he didn't want me to kno that he was looking and enjoying these pictures.        But he also added some of these girls in the pictures as friends...some of these girls sent requests to him but he also sent requests to some of the girls too.        How would you react?  I am really confused!!!!  I feel betrayed but he says that they are "Just pictures" to him......  But to me, when you are sending friend requests it suddenly becomes a interaction between real people even if its via the computer.  Advice?

20090205074609AAiBwml	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Boyfriend And Me.. I'm not so sure I'm happy anymore?	I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year now, and I'm not so sure I'm happy anymore...     We are pretty different from each other, and I go to college 45 minutes away, while he stays home doing nothing (although he does have a trade just not looking for a job yet). All he does is hang out with his buddies and smoke weed and play video games everyday. I don't like that he smokes weed and he said he does it because there's nothing else to do.     We have a different group of friends, and I like to go out partying and dancing, but he never wants to come with me, although he loves going drinking with his buddies... He also did cocaine behind my back before and I later found out, asked him about it, and I said I would give him ONE chance and if he does it again I'm not staying with him, because that's not who I am.    We also don't get along very much anymore... I know I love him, but I don't like the things he does, so does that mean I'm not IN love with him? I think we are just so different and I pick out the little things that I don't like about him. I want to stay with him, but am I missing out on other things in life by staying with him ?

20090205075537AAh9oaD	Family & Relationships;Friends	Are we drifting apart? Can you help me stop this?	Hi,  I have this friend, and we're really close. She's a grade above me. The first time I met her was when I joined a school musical and we met each other. At first I had a secret crush on her, But now I just want to be friends. The musical rehearsal lasted about half a year, every Thursday. We became really close. That was last year. This year there's no musical. So we have no class or activity we do together anymore. In the beginning of the year, we were doing fine, seeing each other everyday, hugging each other, joking around etc.   Now we're slowly drifting apart, we see each other less often, and for not as much time. We don't hug anymore, she doesn't even touch my arm or hold my hand anymore, like she's scared to touch to me. She used to be excited when she'd see me, now it's like I'm just like everybody else, I'm not as special to her. I feel like the only one putting effort into our friend ship now.  What should I do? How can I stop us drifting apart? I she bored of me? How can we stay good friends?  Thanks so much guys! I really want to hold on to this friendship

20090205081612AA75mvt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would domestic relations lie about a paternity test?	I have this friend who was dating two guys. She ended up getting pregnant to one of them but she wasnt sure which one. the one guy made descent money and the other is a str8 up mooch. The baby came out looking exactly like the mooch. however the court ordered paternity test said that the father was the man who made descent money. because of the baby and the mooch looked so much alike, he asked for another paternity test. Not only did the courts tell him no, he received a court order telling him that if he attempted to get another paternity test he would be put in jail. to me this sounds scandalous. do you think the courts are lying about the results of the paternity test based on which guy made more money?

20090205083419AAJXzwZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long distance relationships.?	I started dating a coworker in December 2006. It was long distance for 3 months and then I moved back to where I met her. She moved in to my place a few months later. Things were great for about a year, but we decided to take a break in March 2008 because we spent way too much time together (lived and worked together). We both ended up sleeping with other people, but got back together in July 2008. Then she had to move away for 4 months for work, but we tried to make it work. I was a little skeptical and I guess I wasn't into it as much as I should have been because I was worried about us breaking up again. Sure enough, we did in December 2008. I found out she cheated and lied to me and ended it. She then took a job in a different city in January 2009. We didn't talk for a few months, but she started calling me again a few weeks ago. She wants another chance and to try the long distance thing again. I do still love her, but is there any way I can trust her now? It was hard for me to take her back after the initial break and we have both been with other people again. Is there anyway this can work? She wants me to move to be with her, but I have a job and house and that would be very difficult.

Where online can I meet new single women and strike up good conversations with them and possibly get to know them?      I'm 20 years old, I live with 4 roommates and I just got out of a not so good relationship. I got a decent job and I am still in college.      Pretty nice guy I guess.

20090205093355AAN4jAA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cougar Hunting? 23 Y Old V-Card Holding Friend?	Hi, I don't want to get with any older women really, I don't care how well they know what they are doing... but I have a friend.    Just to get that out there I'm 24 and I have slept with multiple women...    My friend is 23 and is well... yeah inept... no women. no men either.    he spent a couple thousand dollars at a strip club last weekend... and I need him to knock that off because this isn't the first time... no matter how hard I try or how great of a layup I get for him, it doesn't work.    Notes:    He is a physics teacher/geek   He has no central vision and wears glasses to correct it.    thinning hair near the front and center.    He never knows what to say.    he is a little heavier, but like in the front stomach only?    He is hairy as a werewolf.       NOW! What can I do to help him? I was thinking cougars might be the last resort... any chance someone knows where there is a cougar bar in manhattan?
20090205081757AAplm9c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any coffee drinkers out there?	What are your thoughts on coffee? I'm not necessarily interested in Starbucks foo-foo coffees, just your basic coffee you make at home and your different additives... IE: Folgers, Tasters Choice, Maxwell House... and which blends... If you buy only Starbucks off the shelf to make at home, I want to know why.      Drinking coffee is as personal to me, as having your favorite mixed drink, yes the one that contains alcohol. That first one and about    the first have of your second taste delicious... There's a distinctness about each of these that makes us choose them over and over.       I like Yuban Dark Roast... it's got a flavor that appeals to me. However, I get tired of the same old thing and have found myself buying smaller containers, and trying out different brands lately.   Like currently, I have Folgers Medium Roast in my pantry. I like it, but I like a darker roast, I've found... Folgers isn't the worst I've had, but it's a trusty stand by in a pinch.       Anyway... I'm interested in others opinions or suggestions of coffees to try, and why do you like them? :o) Thanks!

20090205081629AAjroE0	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do u think this is a good wedding photography package?	Let me start by saying that i live in nyc and this photographer is based in manhattan. He is a profressional for 30 years and its actually the one that in charge of taking all the schools pictures around the area. Ive seen his work and its extremely beautiful and professional. I say this because i knoe you need to see the work and make sure you are not deling with a phony.   So for $1600 he gives up to 10 hours of work.   A 12x12 40 page digital album   A 20x30 picture including frame with pictures of our wedding. To hang in your living room or wherever you want to put it.   2 11x14 pictures with frame for both set of parents   A total of up to 20 (in my case 12). 8x10 pictures in a leather folder with name imprintes in the front for the bridal party.   25 thank you cards with pictures   And 200 pictures in a 4x6 album.    I booked this photographer yesterday even though i knew i wanted him because i had seen his work in another wedding i have been to. My fiance thinks the price is pretty steep but i believe the price is actually below what it should be for nyc standards. Do you think this is a steal like i do?

20090205091956AAMGweI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does lazyness warrent abuse?	Sometimes I get lazy and don't clean for a while.  Eventually things pile up and I do a total clean sweep.  My partner gets frustrated when I let things go when it comes to the state of the house.  Last night he was so upset that he got physical with me.  My dog tried to protect me and he got physical with him as well.  I woke up this morning with bruises and am thinking of taking a few pictures just to document what happened.  My dog is limping.  I am entirely dependent on my partner so I do not have the option of going to a hotel as I have no money.  Furthermore I do not think I have the courage and strength to leave.  None of this would have happened if the house was clean.  Therefore it is avoidable.  I just don't know what to do with myself.
20090205092040AAO8WXP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If he's busy with work, will he be annoyed if I want to talk?	He's a bit older than me though we're both in our 20's, and he has a pretty demanding job, whereas mine is pretty stress-free. We've only been seeing each other for about a month, but since I have a lot more time on my hands (and I'm a woman), I think about him a lot and want to talk more. But, he's so busy that we usually can't even hang out until the weekend arrives. Unfortunately, I'm out of town this weekend so I won't get to see him until next (and I'm crossing my fingers that he asks me out for Valentine's day).      So I'm asking... would a phone call after business hours today be annoying or OK? I don't want to bother him.. especially since we haven't spoken since Monday.

20090205075829AAc40St	Family & Relationships;Friends	Confronting a friend?	I've been friends with this girl Jenny for about a year. We've gotten very close and I consider her one of my best friends. There is a guy I've gone out with a few time and who I like very much, named John. He called me very late the other night and told me I needed to call Jenny because she was out at a bar and had called him and was trying to line up a booty call, and saying that she was jealous that he liked me, etc, etc. He seemed a little embarassed and would not repeat what she said word for word (I'm assuming it was very explicit) but did ask me to check in on her because she sounded completely wasted. I thanked him and told him to go back to sleep. She did not answer my call. I'd spoken to her earlier in the night and knew she was with friends and hadn't driven so I left it at that and went back to bed myself. I'm disturbed by this because I would never in a million years do that to her or any friend. We're adults in our early 30's, not stupid kids. She kept texting me yesterday and asking me out to dinner and asking me to call her but I'm not quite sure what to say yet. He'd rather me just put it in the past and pretend like it didn't happen because it's a little awkward. Apparently she texted him yesterday and apologized and he responded no biggie, just don't do it again. I feel like I need to address this because she needs to know she can't do these underhanded things to me and think I'll turn the other way. I'll continue to be her friend, but I won't ever forget this happened. My trust for her is diminished to some degree. My question is...do I say something? If so, what?

To all the people are on YA looking for advice regarding their spouse that won't have sex with them (for whatever reason, usually the 'excuse' is low sex drive) -       While you are spending your day thinking about the problem, looking for advice, being upset, frustrated, confused and putting all kinds of effort into trying to fix it........what do you think your spouse is doing?      Do you think they are thinking about it too?      Do you ever think that while you are being tortured by this issue, they are having an affair w/ out a care in the world, leaving your emotions in the dust?      I never see anyone on here saying or admitting they won't have sex w/ their spouse.......so what are these spouses that won't put out doing???      I would love to get the perspective of people who WON'T have sex w/ their spouse but they are no where to be found!      What do you think?
20090205073854AAl8ZkR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My father had an affair over 20 years ago?	My father just told me this last night. It happened almost half his lifetime ago, before i was born, i am almost 22. The only reason he told me was because i am currently seeing the daughter of the woman he had the affair with. We both go to the same university, what are the odds...      Anyway, he told me this because i cant let the relationship get serious for my mother's sake, which i understand.      I never knew this about my parents because they got along so great my entire life. When this happened, my dad moved out and the two of em got counseling, and obviously the marriage was repaired. I still have as much respect for my father as ever, in fact might have more because he made the effort to make things work and he had the balls to tell me what happened and was ashamed of it.      I just need help to get through this i guess. any advice will do..

Over the past 30 years we have grown into almost complete opposites.  Yet for the sake of family and love (I love him as my brother but I can't stand him.) I need to see him occasionally.  When we get together it is obvious we despise each other and after awhile the barbs start flying.  It may sound immature but that is the reality of it.  I have thought of a heart to heart but he is a cold fish.  He would probably just simply say, Oh, I didn't know there was a problem.  And before long the insults would start flying again.  How can I make it better?

20090205090135AATyfrX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is This Over-Stepping Boundaries?	Recently my supervisor confided to me that due to the economy her family is really hurting, financially.       Her grown son and his girlfriend and their daughter live with her, my supervisor is divorced and doesn't make a ton of money. Her son is "disabled" hurt his back and cannot work...or should I say won't suck it up and work at a gas station or McDonalds to make sure his daughter is fed.      She told me she only eats one meal a day. This breaks my heart. She's such a nice lady and doesn't charge her son rent or anything.       Our company handed out Christmas hams to us and since I'm single and live alone I never made mine and don't really care for ham anyway.       Would it be too much to offer her the ham? I don't want it to come off as charity but if I say I have no room or need for it, would that be ok?
20090205075225AA1XGhq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Pretending to be "perfect"?	There's a guy in my composition class who says that he has perfect pitch.  I have noticed him naming notes when they are played (and he's not looking) and getting them right.  Unfortunately, I have perfect pitch too.  Regardless, of the trait that we supposedly "share", the guy gives me the cold shoulder.  He even rolled his eyes after one of my performances at a concert. (I congratulated him after his performance).  Also, unfortunately, I think that I know a secret about him.  (Every morning, he walks to a piano and plays a note before class and keeps singing it.  I think he memorizes a pitch and uses that so that everyone will think that he has perfect pitch in class.)      However, one day, he began to act nicer.  A week afterward, he asked if I would play the piano part to one of his compositions.  I agreed.  At the rehearsal, I realized that my part was much harder than all of the other parts and the room was filled with all of his friends. He conducted the piece at a very fast speed, faster than it was labeled.  When I made mistakes, he would glare at me and smirk at his friends.      Why is he so mean to me?  I don't treat him this way!

20090205075454AA0BeQH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What the hell is wrong with everybody?... or is it me?	Everyone I know thinks their lives have to involve babies in some way. They want to have as many as they can when they know full well what is involved ($$$$$$$$$$$$).  They think they are so cute and everything they do is precious but its not really, or maybe I'm just a heartless bastard who isn't capable of feeling the "joy" a kid brings everyone else. I'm tired of everyone telling me it will be different when I have my own but that can apply to a lot of things, like if you drive a car that I don't like you can't tell me it would be different if I drove the same car... if I hate yours I'm gonna hate one thats mine.

20090205080448AAyvK5W	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I make my husband feel good about himself?	I have criticized him for years and he finally found the appreciation he deserved somewhere else. Now that we are working on our marriage and he says the affair is over, how do I make sure he knows how wonderful I think he is. I say good things to him all the time, but I don't think he believes how great I think he is. Probably partly because of the guilt he feels about the affair and how much it hurt me. I wrote him a poem and could tell he liked it alot, but I've got years of making up to do. So what actions can I do to help him feel it. Don't say sex, because I'm already doing that, whenever he wants

20090205081654AA54Dy4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How normal is it to be led on?	I'm not very experienced with women so whilst most guys take 20 seconds to ask a girl out it takes me a lot longer (about a week in this case).   I asked a girl out on my course at university who I knew for a while for a coffee, her friend joined for the first half then it was just me and her. We talked for a bit and got on really well. I would have asked her out earlier had she not had a boyfriend and I thought she had broken up with him.   I found out toiday that she got back together with him before we we went on a "date" so obviously I feel really embarrassed that she led me on and I'm sort of avoiding her (her friend told my friend she spent the night with her bf last night).   Does this happen a lot? This is the second time this has happened to me and I've asked out 3 girls.

20090205090926AAAv4Ww	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell my girlfriend to not hang around certain friends?  I really shouldn't have to...opinions please?	I would never tell my girlfriend to not go out with a certain person but I'm stuck in this situation.  She has a friend I'll call Sarah.  Sarah is a known meth head (says shes off) but continues to hang around some of those people and she does do some drugs.  About 4 months into our relationship my girlfriend went out with Sarah one night.  Sarah drove and they ended going back to one of her "user" friends house.  My girlfriend said that a guy forced her pants down and she started crying and then Sarah had sex with him instead so he'd leave her alone.  And Sarah said she'd take my girlfriend home in the morning.  Ok, i heard about this 2 months after it happened and I wasn't happy but I'm not going to call someone a liar either.  I told her if Sarah was really her friend she would have taken her home immediately.  She said yeah I know but she is going out with Sarah again this weekend.  My girlfriend has 2 children and is a 4th grade teacher at the local elementary.  I told her she doesn't need these kind of friends because of the situations they could put her in.  She said "I know but I don't have any other friends that like to go out"  I just asked her to please drive this weekend and if she didn't to call me and I'll get her.  I dropped all my friends who were like this when my daughter was born (i had 2 like this but with weed and they were really just bums).  Another thing is they were childhood friends.  My GF moved to SC 5 years ago and just moved back in Jan 08.  They had no contact during those 5 years.  We've been dating since she moved back.  Do you think she's just desperate for friends or very naive?  Or maybe just maybe feeding a bunch of BS about what happened that night and knows exactly what shes doing.  I'm about to tell her that if she wants to be with me and have a future than she shouldn't associate with Sarah.  I know how destructive those people can be (some do turn stuff around) and I in no way want to be involved or have my children involved.

20090205073449AAn2fcZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband asked wife, "What can I do to make you happy?"?	I currently have a problem with myself and mine and my husband's marriage for 11 months. I find myself coming home to him complaining about something and I really need to stop that because everytime I complain about something, my husband gets irritated and we end up in an argument. I try to feel what I am feeling right at that moment, but I can't control my emotions and feelings and we end up fussing at each other. I just want some help of trying to control my feelings and emotions without me bursting. Even when I'm mad at him, I want to control myself and let it go. I want my husband to do soo much for me, he asked me one night, "what do you want me to do to make you happy" and I told him we need to spend some time together, I like cuddling, holding hands..etc... Well there is more than that, I love when a man writes me a love note and tells me how much he loves me out of the blue, or gives me flowers, helps around the house instead of napping, cuddles and holds me while we are watching tv, falling asleep in his arms, giving me kisses when we are together at the house or in public or riding in a car together and listening to me when I'm happy, sad, stressed, or mad. I just want to feel all of these, those are my most wanted things from a man, and I'm never going to have another man because my husband is my soulmate and I'm never going to leave him. I read up online about stuff a husband can do for a wife and it had all of the above, so I printed it out and this morning when I woke up, he woke up to, so right when I was leaving for work, he got in the shower, so i grabbed that piece of paper that had all of the above and I wrote on there "Baby, when you asked me what can you do to make me happy, all of these wonderful things would make my day, these are things I would love from a man (you). I love you" and I put it on his pillow... Was that too much to ask?..... I just wanted to give him options of what he can do to make me feel like the happiest woman on earth when things around me seem overwhelming and stressful. I really need help so I can keep the spark in our marriage and not a divorce. Was that crazy to do that? or what should have I done? I really want to be happy in this marriage, I don't want a divorce and he asked me what can make me happy and I gave him different things, was it too much to ask?

20090205091836AAfrnZN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating advice about a girl at work?	Ok, need a second opinion before I take things further about a girl @ work         Theres this girl at work who i like allot & we get allong great every since I started working there, just before christmas. She started seeing this total looser (married army man who never told her he was married with 2 kids) anyways she loved him allot and then he went back to his wife. The week later I asked her out on the saturday for a bar meal/cinema treat her like royality picked her up paid for everything perfect gentlemen. Monday comes we go back to work & she apparently gone back to this armyboy. Now I was that disapointed in her I think it showed because i was cool with her... Its my fault I should of asked her out again for a second date when I dropped her off but I didnt want to rush things.      Now 2 weeks on, shes announced she's single again so the relationship has ended & I really like her should I make my feeling known by asking her out for another date or tell her over msn that I think shes absolutely gorgious & I'd love to take her out? or what should I do!       I think if I dont make my move am going to regret it! Problem is we work together so if I tell her how I feel and she turns me down it's going to be awkward. Also if she does agree to go out with me this weekend should I send her some flowers into work or even to her house the next day? She's proper hit me on my feet, never felt like this about other girls. I was talking to her the other day about if she's been put off by blokes now and she said "not at all" & I said has any1 asked you out yet and she said "not as such". So am worried ill miss my chance & maybe she knows how I feel and is waiting for me to ask her out? its a guys job afterall and I do have the car and means to take her out... Oh its a mess!      Thanks for your replies guys!
20090205091924AABN34t	Family & Relationships;Family	Help! want to move out!?	I am 20 years old and my boyfriend is 21. I have an associates degree in general studies and my boyfriend has his associates in culinary arts. We plan on moving 3 hours away from all of our family. My sister, her husband, and child live in the basement now and i need to get away from it all. We dont know what to say to our plans about our plans. We have been together for 3 years and he has already bought an engagement ring. I dont have a real "career" set up yet but i do have some college education to show. Do you think it would be hard on us to leave and move to another state and buy a home and start our life?   Thanks in advance!
20090205092025AAlrdlD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do my girlfriend flirts with other men right in front of me??? HELP!!?	I am 24 and my girlfriend is 22 we have been together for 3 years. She is Spanish and I am English. I live in Spain but my Spanish is not good.      At the weekend we went to go and see a mutual friend (spanish man). My girlfriend went on an exchange program to the UK for 3 months last year and she lived with him and two other girls (I was in Spain).      We stopped by to see him at his house for just under an hour. He speaks English but chose to speak only in Spanish. I get on with him but my girlfriends body language worried me.      When she was talking to him she played with her hair, put on lip-balm slowly while looking at him, crossed her legs towards him and bounced her leg at him repeatedly. She hung her shoe off her foot seductively pointing at him. She tossed her hair around as well. She turned herself almost completely away from me and sat across from him.      This worried me with the time spent abroad with this man although I see him as a friend. I find it disrespectful to me. I think my girlfriend will do this with other men she is around as well.      Does this suggest something more with this man or other men? How can I prevent it from happening, without leaving her?      She says they are just friends. If I bring this disussion up with her she will get angry and say I am insecure.      I became worried when she was abroad. I questioned several times about some other men and situations but she said they are 'just friends' or nothing happened. Her friends there say nothing happened but would they cover for her?

I am living with my boyfriend, and his ex wife had custody of his two children, and my boyfriend called DCF on her because she was living with my brother and they were beating each other, and drinking and drugging, while neglecting the kids.    )We had not seen the children a good month in a half when he called, she would not let us see them.   So now I have to take these stupid classes which I don’t need..Why is this? Because his ex wife is a loser, that didn’t work and stayed home all day and did drugs and drank? Since I will have my assessment completed and my boyfriend has completed the substance abuse classes all we have left is parenting which will be started buy next court date you think the judge will drop the case..Even though the mother is taking some classes, but still drinking and not visiting the kids …We didn’t have the kids when they took them away from her..and I was the one that told him to call DCF???????? I would of hired an attorney but we are not married and my insurance won’t cover an attorney for him. DCF is all about taking money its sad.I can take care of those two boys much better then his ex, I make way more money and I don’t drink. Very sad.

20090205095638AAbY0CD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How marketable am I being divorced with these issues...?	Hello, this is a bit of an odd question, but here is the situation:   I am 41 yr old man, married three years to a 37 yr old woman.  For the duration of my marriage we have been trying to conceive.  Yada yada yada, so it turns out I'm sterile (since birth). My wife is extremely angry that she wasted the "twilight of (her) fertility" w/me and has even talked about leaving to try w/ someone els.  On her better days she can talk about donor embryos, going to counseling, etc.  My point is this: if I were out there, after 6 years off the market, now fully knowing I am infertile, divorced for that reason, how much more difficult would tha tmake it if I were simly divorced at 41?  BTW I am college educated in a somewhat lucrative and recession proof (medical) career, am otherwise in perfect health, live in an urban area, work out regularly, in style, in shape, let's just say I have definitely not let myself go. Can't show my pic for obvious reasons.        As I stare into the possiblity of being out there again, I wonder what my chances are of finding someone who would be willing to date and eventually marry someone who is infertile.  This means she would have to be open to donor sperm or embryo from the git go.
20090412122127AA4nExt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I made my girlfriend cry in front of my friends?	I know I'm going to get a lot of hate mail from some losers who have nothing better to do than take cheap shots at great people like me. Let me get started off by saying she said that my picture looked scary and refused to put it up on her Facebook. I called her a worthless and useless person to the earth, and said "Jen, you contribute nothing to the world expect you're stupidity and ignorance." My friends laughed but I was kinda sad that she had tears in her eyes. She isn't going to have sex with me at all anytime soon. I was offended when she called my picture scary.

We live in MO and he lives in CO she is wanting to pack up and move there.  She is expecting for him to agree to him living there half a year and here half a year.  To me this is not logical.  She is choosing to leave, not being forced.  The child is 14 so he is not a baby.  He can make some choices on his own.  Dad obviously does not want him to leave for he has Friends, family and everything he knows and loves is here.  What kind of options are there.  Any web sights that might give good advice??

20090205081408AA8ZFxq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does my man have to masturbate and look at porn?	Me and my guy have been together for over a year and a half.  He is 29, I am 27.  We do not live together but I stay with him about 4 nights a week.  I have told him that the sex we have is satisfying to me, but apparently not to him.  His sex drive is higher than mine so he masturbates when I am not around, sometimes while watching porn.  I feel like he is cheating on me with these porn stars and it hurts me.  I'm afraid he wants girls that look like they do.  He doesn't do it alot, but I don't want him masturbating (especially to porn) at all.  I think he should wait for me to be there.  He says it's normal for guys to do this and I shouldn't take it so personally.  The sex we have is great, and he even tells me that when he is masturbating he is thinking of me, because it turns him on to fantasize about me doing dirty things.  He doesn't always look at porn while masturbating, sometimes he just does it because he feels the need to "clean the pipes" everyday or every few days.  But I don't want him doing it at all, it turns me off and then I want him less, so our relationship suffers.  I don't know how to keep him from doing this.

20090205082504AAQMzRL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Un-happily married- when does one call it quits?	We've been married for 7 1/2 years, and my wife and I have absolutely nothing in common. (How we ended up together is a different story)       When we got married, we were both in our mid 20's. Today 7 1/2 years later I feel this was the largest single mistake I made.       There is no chemistry in our marriage and almost nothing to look forward to. I'm a very worldly and outgoing person, and my wife is opposite that.       I'm ready to move on; the only thing holding us together is that we have 2 boys, aged 6 and 3- which I love very much. The last thing I would do is want to hurt them in ANY way. A broken home can be devastating to children- but on the flip side a unhappy marriage affects children as well.       The question is, which is worse >staying married unhappily for the sake of the children or divorcing and having the kids live between their parents lives.       Anyway you cut it, this is a unfortunate situation; the question is which is the lesser of the two evils.       Therefore I reach out to you fellow Americans (and non-Americans alike) what is your honest and truthful opinion?

20090205083813AAOcL0w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating someone older, please help. pleaseeee :(?	okay, i'm almost 13 and he will be 17. I understand the age difference is big, but i really have feelings for him. I'm very mature for my age and so it makes the situation different. We are both okay with the age difference but our parents aren't. This may sound crazy because i'm so young but i really think i love him. He isn't using me because i've dated him over a month and we haven't even done anything. My mom doesn't know about it, and it really bothers me. He wants to talk to my mom and tell her how he feels about me but i dont know how she would take that. do you think my mom would just make us break up, or do you think she'd actually let us stay together? i guess what im asking is, what do i do?? we broke up for about three weeks and i was just starting to get over him and now we're dating him and idk if it was a mistake or not. so, please help me out. :)   thanks.         As a side note, he wants to get married right when i get out of school, and the way i know him he doesn't kid about stuff like this. so he's pretty serious about it. also, ive never really been a kid, i've always been mature and idk if i'm growing up to fast by getting in this relationship because it can get prettty serious i'm sure, idk i mean maybe i should just take time off and be a kid. but idk i really like him. so yes i'm in a ******* pickle, please help.      i'm not planning on having sex with him. and its not really serious. its just dating. i'm not planning for the future but what i mean is it could happen not that im going to put everything into it for us to get married, what happens happens. i just i dont want to miss out on anything by dating him.
20090205082136AAoQR91	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What to do to get her back? what is possible in the future?	My girlfriend and I broke up a little over a month ago after 3 years. She is talking/with this 24 or 25 year old guy in the army. She is 18. We just recently started talking again about 2 weeks ago. We hung out mon and tues and ran. On mon she kissed me. I know that she still feels something for me and she says she misses me. Idk what to do. She said on tues that she didn't want to hang out much cuz it was like we were together again and she said that she thinks that her and the other guy will work out. He tells her he loves her but they havnt been together that long and she doesn't tell him that. Every night she calls him, he is getting drunk and she hates that.    Idk what to do to show her that I'm here for her now and he isn't. I don't want to just forget about her and move on. What can I do to get her back?...

20090205082948AAbzgL4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls...May I have your honest opinion about this?	I don’t have a whole lot of dating experience, but I do wonder if what I did was normal or not—from a female perspective.  I had gone out once with this girl, then we had a second date.  She invited me over to her place.  I asked to use her bathroom, and when I went in, I discovered a pair of her undies on top of a hamper.  Since she lived alone, I assumed that they were hers, and the thought crossed my mind to take a quick whiff to possibly get an idea of what I might be getting close to later.  Do you truly think that this is weird or abnormal?

Not a long time I know. But the thing is my last relationship of 3 years ended about 3 months ago. I miss my ex like crazy sometimes. She saw us at my families skating rink together and left then was caught crying there the next day, what does that mean. She broke up with me? I begged her to come back. Is it now that she can't have me she want's me? I'm afraid that if i catch wind that she wants me back I won't even give the new girl a fair chance.

20090205082304AAHlwoZ	Family & Relationships;Family	EVIL older sister!!  help?	okay so heres my story. home schooled by my mom all my life along with three sisters and one brother..oldest two kids are in college and ones close, she goes to college classess (the ones you take before you get to college) and so shes not home early in the morning.  okay so my older sister (im thirteen she's fiveteen) she acts like a three year old alot though.  Okay so shes a COMPLETE computar-holic. I love the computar don't get me wrong. but she's CONSTANTLY on it..when my mom is not looking shes reading or watching something on the computar. my mom notices alot but not all the time and sometimes i tell her that shes not doing her school work..but she gets mad at me because its none of my businees, my mom said that she would take care of her addiction, and put a limit to how much time shes on the computar.  She's only done something like twice.  she said that she needed to stop being on the computar constantly and do something else..  well my sister is lazy and the computars the only thing she can find to do..so those two times when my mom told her to do something else, she heard me talking to my mom so she knew it was me..she got really mad at me, but she didn't do anything really, all she did was talk to me and try to make me feel sorry for her.. like, "Mom got mad at me and told me that I need to do other things than computar,,,,she won't let me use the computar THANKS ALOT!!!!!"   what a baby.   anyways she's always on the computar.....SO,......question number one...how do I get her to stop being SOOOO addicted to the computar and loosen up and not be so grouchy?  (she stays up late and is always tired and ANGRY!) and question number two....Okay so we have a piano in the same room as the computars and its like two feet from the one she uses..I LOVE playing the piano its so much fun!!!  I play all the time composing or just randomly playing some song.  Its one of the few fun things that I like to do when I'm really bored.   But today when I played she freaked out and was all YOU ALLWAYS ON THE PIANo !!!!!  its anoying!!!!   (btw since shes on the computar watching videos, my piano drows her videos out...and just bugs her)  so my mom said that i should onhly be able to have an hour a day,,,whenever i want to play piano and kate can go somewhere else.   (that's during school she means i should have an hour to practice piano every school day) but i like to play all the time once school is over.  but i think that she wants me to ohly have an hour)  how is this fair???? my mom needs to get her off the computar and let me play the piano.  she's the only one that really gets annoying and mad at me playing.      okay well I guess that's it...i know its long and I ramble but she bugs me so much!!! and she acts like a little threee year old all the time...when my mom went to another room I told her way to go!!! you just kept me from doing one of the few fun things I like to do when Im bored!!!!!!!  and i talked to her about how it wasn't fair....i only got like two sentences in though becuase she turned her ipod on so she wouldn't be able to hear me,.....and my mom asks me why im so sad?!???  this isn't fair!!! and what do i do about those two things?      PLEAASEEEEEE help!!!!! she bugs me so much!!!!
20090205082808AAQKKhR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I feel about my girlfriend wanting to be an exotic dancer(stripper). Should we end the relationship?	I am 19 yrs old she is 20. She is a beautiful girl, she is in college, and we have the best relationship in the world. We have been dating for seven months and back when we first met she told me that she had danced at a club before but I did not really think anything of it. She feels that being an exotic dancer is the only way for her to make money in the struggling economy because she can not find a decent paying job. Although I am really in love with this girl the question I keep asking myself is do I really want to be with a stripper? She keeps telling me honey its only temporary until I get a real job I promise but who knows when that will be? How do I deal with this situation?

20090205082710AAGmfcI	Family & Relationships;Family	Parent is spending the childs deceased fathers social security check on herself drugs, gambling and boyfriend?	My sister is a junkie and was not with the father when he passed away. Her son is now 10 years old and receives social security checks from his fathers work history. He is not receiving care from her, he has been receiving care from my mother his grandma more on than off for as long as I can remember. She is spending the money to do drugs, gamble, motels, and on her boyfriend (fathers cousin) to keep him around and happy. The boy loves his mom who is in and out of jail due to drug use and theft. She was living with us all and was kicked out recently due to her drug use and jail time for suspected theft. How do I approach a change in the care of her son for these checks to go towards someone who is consistently having his best interests in mind. This would be my mother, his grandmother. She has been supporting him and his needs for years and still will be I am sure.
20090205082817AAeswhA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do tou think she likes me?	there is this girl who i use to like, and i had tryed to get her to like me for mouths and i wasn't getting no where. So i gave up. but  i have been watching her and her attitude when around people consist on: being mean to me, messing with me, making jokes about me, calling me names, all in a hate and love kinda way, but when i am alone with her she is nice to me, she offers stuff, asks me to do thing nicely, asks for my opinion and so on.

She's absolutely crazy about him and was distraught when he asked me out. I dont really like him bbut he keeps asking me. Its getting  annoying.      But there's more. For some stuid reason, Laura's other friend Sarah has asked Robert out so that she can break up with him in a month or so and get Laura to comfort him then he should ask her out. I just told Robert plain and siple that Laura likes him and he already knows.      I now know that he isnt worth anything if he's going out with Sarah even though he knows that Laura and sarah are best mates, and that laura loves him but i need to tell laura and  dont know how to. If i just come straight out with it she'll hate me for telling Robert and Sarah about how she feels and if i dont tell her and she finds out she'll be angry i didnt tell her.

20090205083735AAUDB7Z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My fiance told me some personal secrects, should i trust her?	Well, my fiance and i are getting married this coming september. At first, i didnt think she came with too much baggage. she has an 8 yr daughter from someone else. Well, yesterday night she told me two of her personal secrets, since she said she didnt want to any secrets  between us. Anyway, one of those secrets made me in some ways lose trust in her.       when i met her she said she seperated from her daughters father years ago and they varely spoke, like whn their daughter was two. Anyway, yesterday she said it didnt happen that way. She said, she kept coming back to him to sleep with him again and agin and again. Some times she would spend a week at his house. She said she only did it because she was lonely and wanted to get revenge on him for cheating on him. She she slept with him and with other guys. Anyway she says the last time they were together was a year and half ago, and that she has no feelings for him anymore. SHe said the reason she stopped going to him was because he was going out with another girl. And she promised she would never cheat or go back to him. ANyway, i dont what to tell her or if i should forget about it since this was all before she met me. And im the first serious relationship she had since her ex.       THe other secret she told me was that she was raped by her father when she was 11. Im the only person she ever told this. SHe said she never told her family because she didnt want to break up her parents. she says her father raped her various times when her mother went to work. right now shes 25 and says she has forgiven her father, but she says her father never said sorry or has spoken to her about it. They both talk to each other like it never happened.  I dont know what advice to give her since they both live in the same house.       Anyway i need some advice and comments thanks! }         points for best advice.
