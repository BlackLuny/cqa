MM8rqTMtaa	I'd like to know how "Buy American" doesn't affect trade with Canada.  That doesn't make any sense.  Why did Obama tell them that?
6sjphNcPaa	I'm surprised it's as high as it it. It's only a month and it will tank further! There is no way Obama will have a 2nd term. This deficit/economic "crisis" is now his baby!|`|2kgTdNRQaa	I don't expect anything different from Faux News.|`|PCVJg5ieaa	Ripping off a Wendy's commercial.  Fact.|`|4Aauh87yaa	No wonder at all. He's in way over his head now.<br>  <br>  We were all wondering how poorly an inexperienced community organizer would do as president. We don't have to wonder any more...|`|w38AedkFaa	Obama will have approval rating of about 40% by the end of summer.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	shhh there are still people that are overjoyed the Dem's are in power i want them to keep bragging about victory until its to late|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	He is screwing up.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	I hope he only serves one term. Also, if Palin runs I think she should just blame it all on Obama, like Obama blamed it all on Bush. Then I think they should call for an investigation of Obama, just like the Democrats did with Bush. I also wouldn't mind seeing Sarah Palin on tv every day rather than Obama (uh...umm..duh..uh).<br>  <br>  Fair is fair. Change we can believe in......|`|r6JskEtxaa	I don't think Fox is a reliable source when it comes to polls.<br>  <br>  I never listen to Fox News especially when it comes to opinions|`|KF48OjyDaa	haha...as usual, Fox gave you half the story...he is only losing ground with Republicans...here is the same poll broken down by party<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/obama_job.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pollingreport.com/obama_job.h...</a>|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	I think it's funny that you see a dip from 65% approval rating to 60% as a victory for the GOP.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	I already got my Palin 2012 shirt.|`|j38mlGvZaa	Fox News...hahaha.<br>  <br>  I thought maybe you got your source from a place of intelligence.

It is considered propaganda in the journalistic world.    I'm a journalist and if any one uses Fox news as a news source, they would be fired.  The National Enquirer is considered a better news source.  So that should tell you what the real world thinks of it.|`|nlwJlHpdaa	Of course foxnews is anti-Obama.<br>  <br>  What are the pro-Obama news sites saying?<br>  <br>  The truth is probably somewhere in between.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, you might want to research what the word fact means and how it differs from the word opinion.|`|86jsHmOVaa	Obama's approval rating is nearly as high as Palin's tax bill..|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Huckabe & Palin 2012 !|`|oU1OH9Usaa	We saved the country in the 30s after you did nothing to help it, and it looks like were doing it again

I bet you even forgot that it was McCains buddy Gramm, a registered Republican, who said that.<br>  <br>  Yeah that sure is some super "free thinking" and "open mindedness" you've got going on there...take a statement which clearly ties in with one specific observation and twist it into a blanket statement. Instead of being honest and admitting that Holder's statement about cowardice was within the context of the subject he was speaking about...you lay it out there like Holder was saying Americans are cowards in everything they do.<br>  <br>  And by all means, please do just get out of the way and let Liberals take over, we could get a lot done in this country without a bunch of whiny bitter losers obstructing progress in this country.<br>  <br>  Again...your such a free thinker, while you are busy obsessing over abortion do you ever stop to think for even a second about the children that have died, been left homeless, or lost their parents in the Iraq war?<br>  <br>  Or are you the typical repub, your caring is only extended to the unborn children of the world and you could care less about the children dying or suffering in a foreign country?...What you really care about is that YOU "feel safer with Saddam out of power"....selfishness, another commonly found trait among Repugs.<br>  <br>  Funny too is how you seem to think that just because Liberals support the right to choose who people can legally marry, then ALL liberals must be either gay or lesbian and the population would drop to nothing. Sorry to burst your bubble but I support the right for gay people to be married...I am not gay...and my wife just gave birth to a little boy who I am quite sure is going to be a future Liberal. :-)<br>  <br>  You posted a question yesterday and gave the best answer to a guy who saw Holder's statement as something sinister, the guy was afraid the Government was about to force people of differing races to mingle on the weekends...so you people have a problem with the government trying to tell you who to associate with yet you also WANT the government to tell people who they can or can not marry.<br>  <br>  Can you free up your mind enough to say "Hypocrisy"?<br>  <br>  So lets get it straight....Republicans want Government to stay out of the lives of Republicans but you want to USE Government to intrude upon the lives of people whose lives Republicans disapprove of?<br>  <br>  Can you open your mind up enough to say "Double Standard"???<br>  <br>  Peace to you free thinking person...|`|0nZHAaQDaa	no we'd be in a lose lose situation as no workers no taxes no nothing we'd not have stores to purchase form we'd all be playing video games in mom's basement, or lining the exits on freeways with signs that say help me out I'm too lazy to work money for drugs and booze|`|1amF7oNwaa	WHAT IF WE CANNOT REPAIR ALL THE DAMAGE THAT WILL BE DONE?|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	You don't care about anyone but yourself.

If women want to abort, how does it affect you???<br>  <br>  But I agree with you on one thing ... if we all became liberal, this world would be a better place!!!|`|DLvHWOo7aa	I posed this question some time ago.<br>  <br>  If liberal policy is so doomed to fail you'd think putting up with it for 8 years would be a small price to pay to eradicate it. <br>  <br>  The only logical solution is that the right wing knows we would win and it would destroy the republican party forever because of the paradise we would create.|`|frDcAqyWaa	kinda yeah, the liberal way takes a long time tho, because you have to debate laws and set norms and that takes time.  The time lag the only real down side|`|r6JskEtxaa	Because some people can't take care of themselves<br>  <br>  And we can't let them just die
u1bFsnCPaa	The left spend so much time in college, experimenting with mind altering substances, they think they're enlightened. If you get into a an honest debate with one, however, they only shout over you, screaming "Bush sucks", or "better then 4 more years". I recently got into an online debate with a kid from Brown University over the stimulus package, and he offered not one fact to back up his many statements. When it ended, he wrote a 3 paragraph "response", and each paragraph ended by telling me to eat a very specific body part of his, and to kiss a very smelly, pale part of his body.<br>  <br>  To me, this was disturbing, and not just because of his vulgarity. I was disturbed that a political science major had to revert to name calling and play ground antics because of his inability to get his point across. But not once did he stop and think, "perhaps my point is wrong, maybe I'm looking at this wrong"... instead, he drops some bombs, and ignores my response.<br>  <br>  The immaturity level of these people, kids and adults, continue to amaze me.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	I watched a documentary last night on HBO called RIGHT AMERICA: FEELING WRONGED - SOME VOICES FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.  Nancy Pelosi's daughter made it on the campaign trail with McCain.  She stuck mics in front of the crowds and asked them questions.  Not one person she spoke to were able to state why they wanted to vote for McCain, they just spouted off the rhetoric about Obama that Republicans used to try and discredit him.  That is a fact.  The ignorance of those folks astounded me.  That is the loyal Republican voter base.  They weren't stating facts, they were spouting garbage vehmently and loudly and with much emotion.  One guy CRIED about how bad Obama would be for this country because he was a terrorist.  Huh?  That sound well informed to you?|`|NQYKzv7faa	Because they feel that all those things republicans know, such as that lower taxes are better for the economy, are just racist redneck folklore instead of common sense.  Consider that all of academia and the news channels and hollywood tell they are smarter that republicans daily, so they believe it.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Most liberals are legends in their own minds Bob .

You have to register that as well, and there is nothing in the bill of rights guaranteeing your right to private transport.<br>  <br>  get off the crazy train and realize that guns are deadly weapons.  it's in all of our best interest to have them licensed to people who should also have to be trained in how to (and how not to) carry them, clean them, store them, shoot them and most of all, how to keep them out of the reach of their kids.<br>  <br>  please remember, big brother was in a book.  of fiction.  there is no massive eye watching you, just a bunch of bored feds listening to your phone calls.|`|ZWnUXirVaa	H.R. 45, otherwise known as "The list of people from whom we will confiscate guns."|`|lHDff8Braa	If you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Isn't that what the gun people always tell us?|`|AA10962298	Wait a minute till your link works....|`|UHTcpdkVaa	I'm kinda amazed (ok, not really) that they think they can do that.

Considering more kids die from football and/or pools than guns - perhaps they should license football helmets and water wings too.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	The bill is about licensing of gun owners.  I suppose if you also think having to have a license to drive a car is an invasion of privacy, this bill is also an invasion of privacy.  But I don't think that.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	That bill is a violation of the 2nd Amendment.

1CIOPwR0aa	noo because obama doesn't like cheeze its ...................|`|lgW9kz82aa	That is actually a great question.  I think that it did technically in some ways prove that America is no longer a society dominated by racism.  Ultimately though, I'm not so sure that MLK ever motivated black Americans to take control of their own lives.  I would argue that most black people are no longer incapable of being successful because there are much fewer barriers.  But still, blacks tend to be poor, tend to have children without fathers, and a high proportion of them are incapable of surviving without government assistance.  No, I don't think that was the dream of MLK.  You can blame it all on the system or racism, but I don't think most blacks that were honest with themselves could say that the failure of the black community in recent years is solely because of racism.  I think that if black Americans want to fulfill the dreams of MLK, they need to stop looking for someone to save them and start building a better future for themselves.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Absolutely not,  In Martin Luther King's " I have a dream " Speech, One of the highlights of the speech was when he said , And I quote " I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character " Now I ask you to be brutally honest, Do you believe African Americans voted for this man based on the content of his Character ? Or the color of his skin ? I think if you were brutally honest, You would have to admit to the latter . Prior to this election, No one had ever even heard of Obama, He did nothing of any great significance, And yet African Americans overwhelmingly voted for him , If not for his color , Then why ? It certainly wasn't because of his record, Or history of accomplishments, Because he has not history of accomplishments. Some blacks even admitted to the fact that they voted for him based on his color, I have had African Americans openly admit to me, That every African American they know, Voted for this man based on his color . Many have deemed this election as a victory in overcoming racism, Voting for a black man based on his color, Is not overcoming racism, That is racism  ! God bless.|`|fnXN6cKSaa	Because MLK didn't have a dream about a black President.  He had a dream about the end of racism, when black and white people, and all shades in between, would treat each other as equals.  Obama's inauguration as President is a step in that direction, but it's only one step on a road with no end.  It will be a long, long time, if ever, when human beings treat each other as equals.  We don't even treat all people of our OWN race equally, let alone people of other races, creeds and colours.  We have to aim for that of course, but I fear it is unattainable for the foreseeable future.  Martin Luther King's dream remains unfulfilled.|`|Iptnp2zCaa	I do not think that Obama should be referenced as the savior for MLK's dreams.  MLK dreamed for equality for all black people.  True, some of his dreams have been fulfilled.  Black people are not longer required to be segregated on the bus, in schools, or in public areas.  However, they are still judged in certain arenas.<br>  <br>  One of MLK's dreams was that black people "will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."  How many times do people look at a black person on a dark street and shiver?  Assuming that all are bad?<br>  <br>  True, by sheer will, plenty of black people, such as Obama have persevered.  But don't forget, his mother was white... He was raised by white grandparents.  Did that help him in his success?  maybe, maybe not.<br>  <br>  I would like to see Obama succeed or fail based on his actions.  Not as an answer to MLK's dream.|`|y6YHdUzfaa	No i do not think that Obama's election was fulfiling of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s dream.  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s dream was that everyone be treated equally and the world could be a place where no racism existed and brothers and sisters could get along.  Obama getting elected was not sufficient enough to make up for all the racism and hate going on in the world.  <br>  <br>                            Sorry,<br>                                      Shane|`|62d419570572377e88e6cca8cc106a30aa	No.  Obama was elected BECAUSE he was black.<br>  <br>  Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned a world where people would be judged by their character and not their race.  Many black people will not deny that the only reason they voted for him is because of his race.  That is still not living in equality.  It's just black people doing what they condemn white people for doing.|`|ciQFlpuLaa	no. Martin Luther King did not promote anyone's skin color. he wanted us to judge people by the "content of their character" ...last year, 97% of blacks voted for Obama. did they listen to Dr. King's words? obviously not. many Obama supporters simply wanted a black president.|`|R7Hexutqaa	It is a manifest sign the dream is on its way to complete fulfillment.  However the racist hate directed at Obama and his supporters - even though they are small minority tell us the dream is not yet fulfilled.|`|KiDq2xNiaa	no. MLK's dream wasn't to have black people in office. for that matter it wasn't affirmative action. no his dream was no one would care about race. for some that dream has been fulfilled for years others were still waiting on.|`|RhDPB70Baa	Somehow I doubt MLK wanted a socalist dictatorship.  Don't say it isn't a dictatorship either, because the democrats in Congress obey their savior's word as law.|`|supRA4eOaa	King wanted people to be judged by the content of their character........<br>  <br>  Obama was elected because of his color.|`|DRDdUhQ2aa	Don't get me wrong,I respect Obama as our president,however I think African American people enjoy the same rights and equality now,before even a black president was elected.|`|euYwRXCMaa	no because obama isnt qualified and he was just elected on popluarity. nothing is being accomplished.|`|0816304797066153784f125d3c7f1337aa	in some ways but it could also make his dream get a bad reputation if he doesint follow through well enough..|`|n9HAc3H2aa	It started MY nightmare.|`|jRpT3a4waa	In some ways it did, because this country voted for him and it proves that we're not racist like the whole world thought.

King's delivery of the speech on August 28, 1963, from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, was a defining moment of the American Civil Rights Movement. Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters, the speech is often considered to be one of the greatest and most notable speeches in history and was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century by a 1999 poll of scholars of public address.[1] According to U.S. Representative John Lewis, who also spoke that day as the President of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, "Dr. King had the power, the ability and the capacity to transform those steps on the Lincoln Memorial into a modern day pulpit. By speaking the way he did, he educated, he inspired, he informed not just the people there, but people throughout America and unborn generations."[2]<br>  <br>  At the end of the speech, Dr. King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised peroration on the theme of "I have a dream", possibly prompted by Mahalia Jackson's cry, "Tell them about the dream, Martin!".[3] He had delivered a speech incorporating some of the same sections in Detroit in June 1963, when he marched on Woodward Avenue with Walter Reuther and the Reverend C. L. Franklin, and had rehearsed other parts.<br>  <br>  the answer is yes|`|MVY8xhXlaa	No- I believe Martin Luther King would be for someone who can lead and unite rather than push a leftist agenda and divide.  Everything Obama does, he first mocks Bush and Republicans (like he can't stop campaigning), and then he "tells" us how it's going to be- like it or not.  This is leading?  This is NOT a dream leader.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	No. Martin was a Republican. He would have voted for McCain. His thought would be not to elect someone by the color of their skin, but the content of their character. McCain had the character.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	No. MLK did not say, "I have a dream that a black man will be President... and that's it." His dream was equality and the end of racism, which has yet to fully occur. Racism is, unfortunately, alive and well.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	In part... Dr. King's dream wasn't a Black president.  It was fair opportunity for everyone.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	No, because according to Holder, we're all still cowardly racists.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	No - I don't think so because Dr King never said anything about free pie.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	...well i'm sure it isn't what lincoln expected...

Just what I thought.|`|h3K3HP7iaa	nope hes keepin things under wraps|`|AA10124897	No, his transparency is questionable... There are several executive orders he's signed that has stayed hidden...

And it's so much fun to watch him tip over Bush's attempts to turn this country into a republican death camp.  <br>  <br>  In the first few hours, Obama reinvigorated the Freedom of Information Act which our Li'l moron Bush killed the second he got into the White House all those LONG 8 years ago!<br>  <br>  Oh!!! Watch the sparks of democracy fly now!|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Truthful...no. Open...yes. His socialist policies are right out in the open.

Ry61ViNZaa	This is what the poverty pimps like Sharpton do.  If they don't scream racism when ever they can, they will not continue to be supported by the losers that follow their lead.  And then the cash dries up.<br>  <br>  As for the cartoon, when I saw it I never thought of Obama once.  I immediately laughed at how they incorporated an out of control ape to this out of control spending package.<br>  <br>  I never even thought of a person at all.

You dont have to give up what u believe in- i mean its all image and marketing.

One of the problems with the "recovery" we had under Bush during the early part of his presidency, and one that has dogged him since, is that his recovery was a "demand-less" recovery.<br>  <br>  Demand never increased again, which means demand for goods wasn't there.

ZWnUXirVaa	You falsely assume that all jobs created would be product manufacturing jobs.<br>  <br>  You also fail to account for the existing jobs that have been outsourced to foreign countries due to the confiscatory corporate tax rates in the U.S. If you want to keep jobs in the U.S. make the U.S. a competitive job market. It's not that hard to understand.<br>  <br>  REPLY: Just becasue all businesses sell a product or service doesn't mean all jobs within the business are production related.<br>  <br>  Nothing in Econ 101 states that a business must accept a certain level of demand. A successful business will find ways to create additional demand for their product. Perhaps the the new job created is in the marketing department?|`|IJTcGIG7aa	Supply side VS Demand side....<br>  <br>  One of these has been given all the love since Reagan.<br>  <br>  This is why our middle class is in tatters and the manufacturing base of this country has disappeared.<br>  <br>  This is why our stock market is bloated and all the markets are crashing, the top has too much....so it doesn't help the supply side either, that the demand side (PEOPLE) are suffering.<br>  <br>  Wages have only gone down since the 1970's.   Families that used to survive on one income....all require two working parents + a load of debt now.   <br>  <br>  We need to build good jobs, a strong economy built on the WORKER, before all else.|`|de711i5Vaa	The key is new business. And since the USA has a 35 percent Business tax charge compared to, say Ireland, who has only a 12 percent charge, if you were to open a new business where would you put it?|`|AA11163314	Business tax cuts stimulate the economy in two ways.<br>  <br>  The first thing they do is lower the cost of producing the product.  Lower prices not only increases demand - but makes those goods more competitive against imports.<br>  <br>  The next thing these tax cuts do is that make owning or expanding a business more profitable for the owner.  As a result more capital will be invested to create and expand businesses.<br>  <br>  Look at this way.  A 10% across the board tax cut means that a business can cut the price of their product by 5% and still make the same profit.  This equates to more of our goods being exported to toehr countries and - more jobs making those goods.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Not really.  Most of the extra money goes to shareholders in the form of dividends or as bonuses for current employees.<br>  <br>  Businesses bring on more employees either as a result of increased business or in preparation to launch new product lines or services that will generate additional income.<br>  <br>  It's common fallacy that tax cuts create jobs.  They don't, not to any significant numbers.  A $1 tax cut generates about $1.02 in economic activity.  Most of that is from redistribution of that to shareholders, and most of THAT winds up in additional investments.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Companies in a stagnant market will not hire more workers, at least not for that market and their existing product(s).  However, they may hire workers to add new products and/or expand into new markets.  <br>  <br>  Two big parts of our problem in the economic area are free trade agreements and corporate taxes.  <br>  <br>  We allow low-wage countries like China, which is a fellow member of the WTO, to sell here, but we can’t sell there because our costs are too high for us to offer competitive prices.  Our minimum wage is now $6.55.  It will increase to $7.25 in July.  China’s workers earn less than $1.00 per hour. Also, land, buildings and equipment (and everything else) are more expensive here than in China, due in part to our labor costs, and we have a lot of government regulations and reporting requirements that add up.  We have environmental regulations, which are expensive.  China does not seem to know what such things are. China subsidizes its industries and manipulates its currency, both of which are violations of WTO rules.<br>  <br>  Many people talk about our corporations’ “exporting” our jobs to foreign countries.  But it’s our government that has done that through its free trade policies.  If you want to buy a new toaster, do you want to buy a domestically manufactured one for $19.95 (bet you can't find pne) or buy it at Wal-Mart and pay $9.95?<br>  <br>  I won’t belabor the issue of our corporate tax rates because even if we eliminated corporate taxes entirely, we would still not be competitive with China and other low-wages countries.<br>  Some of our big accounting firms are into outsourcing.  You give them your tax information and they transmit it to India to have your return prepared.<br>  <br>  During World War II, our automakers produced the planes, jeeps and other equipment we needed to fight the war.  What will we do if we allow our automobile industry to collapse?<br>  If we don’t do something, and soon, we’re not going to have to worry about hiring domestic workers.  There won’t be any jobs for them.  We need to quit the WTO and put quotas on foreign-made goods.  That will create some fierce arguments among some of our trading “partners,” but if we don’t, our economy is doomed.|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	It doesn't they took the money and kept laying off.|`|5fFgrET8aa	The same way not carrying a 50 pound bag lets you walk farther and faster.

The last time there was such a vast wealth gap in America was right before the Depression and it was a major contributor to it|`|AA11518835	You have to remember that price and demand are functions of one another. The more demand, the higher the price.<br>  If businesses get tax cuts, then they have less overhead and the price of their products can come down.<br>  Right now, depending on how measured, the US has either the highest or second highest corporate tax rate in the world, and that does not include state and local taxes. If just the Federal Corporate tax rate was eliminated, prices would drop by an average of 30%. That is a huge amount.<br>  <br>  As far as hiring, you hire if you can expand. But if the taxes are too high, you have too much overhead to pay and you can't expand. <br>  <br>  You make money by hiring people so the revenue of your business can increase. You certainly can't operate 2 stores with one worker.<br>  <br>  You say "You only make money by selling product. Not by hiring people". But when you hire more people you can sell more products. That is so obvious I can't believe you asked.<br>  <br>  And last, Jay would hire ten people to move ten 50 lb. bags. That way he can make more money by selling more products!<br>  <br>  It isn't as though margins in the US are that good, and that is why it would be a great benefit to lower taxes.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Every single argument you make ignores the fact that price is a function of demand and vice versa!  If you lower a price, the demand goes up. If you raise the price demand goes down.<br>  <br>  That is called "market price" and you should have learned it in Economics 101.<br>  <br>  If you try to sell a candy bar for 3 dollars, very few people will buy it. If you try to sell the same candy bar for 10 cents, everyone will buy it. Demand changes because price changes.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	It's all tied together my man. You cut taxes on businesses so they can lower their prices. Do you actually think the companies keep their products the same price when they are taxed more? No.<br>  <br>  If they can lower the price of their product, then more people will buy it. Supply and demand has always worked. Then when businesses sell more products, they will hire more people to help supply these products. Then those hired people have jobs, get paid and in turn go out and by other goods and services.<br>  <br>  You also keep more business here in the United States. If you tax a corporation more...where do you think they will build a new factory if they have a choice of paying higher taxes here, or going to Ireland and building there? Hmm, that's an easy one.<br>  <br>  It's always worked that way and Democrats hate it because it puts the power in the peoples hands and takes it out of the government.<br>  <br>  Added: To "think about it". So you own a company and you have never increased your product price when your tax went up? Yeah right! We're talking about increase or decrease in taxes, not whether you pay them or not. I think you are not telling the truth or you have other people doing your work.|`|FkGSikg2aa	The idea is to give buisnesses a tax cut so that they have more available funds for payroll, and if it woks out that way then the company can increase their payroll account, and therefore enlarge their employee base. It usually doesnt work as planned, and all it ends up doing is helping the ultra rich buisness owners get a little bit more richer, its a trickle down theory that was created by republicans that has proved time and again to be an inadequate solution to tough economic times and hardships|`|X2rxQopOaa	There are businesses thriving in this economy. When you decrease business taxes, it puts into their coffers more capital. This capital is invested in upgrading equipment, buying a failing competitor or expanding to new markets. All these cost money and that capital would flow from business to create business. This is the only way to generate long term jobs and is proven to increase tax revenue. JFK and  Ronald Reagan knew this.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Apparently you didn't learn anything in economics 101, Other then what the liberal socialist who probably taught the class wanted you to learn . Taxes take revenue away from business son, And if that tax burden is lifted, That company is better able to retain it's current workforce . <br>  God bless.|`|m0T0ywc1aa	Never understood that one myself.  I have a business and I never held back on production to avoid paying taxes.  Seems to me the tax cut would have to be more than the wage paid to hire someone you don't need.
Ca8i226Xaa	Yes, since the party in charge of our country is basically a Socialist party, it makes me nervous whenever they get their hooks in American businesses. I put much more trust in the GOP to let go of control of businesses when a crisis is over. The Dems may just keep control of the banking and auto industries when the crisis ends.|`|eHjk9di0aa	While not the most pleasant places to go, both the DMV and the post office get the job done.<br>  <br>  Not only that but I think there should be a shake up in the banking industry and that the government should give all the paperwork the once over and cut out all the discrimination and outright fraud.<br>  <br>  Add -  the government has handled our money just fine, when you are owed money you get it and when you owe them they get it, again it might not be pleasant, but oh well.<br>  <br>  2nd add - if you want to mention the number of people that are owed money by the government then I get to mention the much larger number of people that have been screwed over by the banking system.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Fear not.

The de facto nationalization--and Iagree, that's what it is--isn't new. Banks and other financial institutions that become insolvent have nationalized temporarily from time to time for the last 85 years. The process is a temporary one. If the bank can be made solvent, it is eventually restored to the private sector. If not, it's assets are sold off to the private sector. Either way, the feds don't stay owners.<br>  <br>  The first time this happened --though on an informal basis--was in 1933, when the outgoing Republican administration had refused to take any action and allowed the banking crisis to reach critical.<br>  <br>  The scale of this particular nationalization process is much larger, to be sure. However, we have President Obama and the Democrats in charge. That's reassuring. If the corrupt Bush administration wee in control of this, this might well turn into a real (that is, permanent) seizure of power.|`|QNvBY1Wgaa	No, not for now. Our country is trashed by greedy business owners trying to convince you that the government taking responsibility for their laissez fair attitude and fixing the problem is a communist conspiracy.<br>  <br>  No, I'm not saying government control is a good thing, but CEOs cant be trusted to run their business fairly any more. in time we'll get back to good old capitalism.|`|6JGls96Eaa	If you did your homework, you'd know that the post office is just about the most efficient business on planet earth.

Problem is when government starts providing all your wants and needs, the only thing you will get are a portion of your needs and no wants.<br>  <br>  The only thing Obama is doing is creating a massive amount of debt that will fall on the shoulders of the next generation.|`|1a10b6b1127b07e424d93d828a3444d8aa	Because anyone with a modicum of understanding knows that government spending and private spending are 2 different balls of wax.<br>  <br>  Now is precisely the time to add to the debt for a couple of reasons<br>  1) the interest rate on the debt is below 1% so it is as close to free money as possible<br>  2) government spending revs up the economy<br>  3) more debt to crush your kids is only just since you have gone out of your way to crush their future anyway|`|84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa	In the last month my income has dived by about a thousand dollars per month.  Bummer for me.  On the other hand for the last several decades I've lived well withing my means.  Against all the advice in the world I paid off my home, own my car free and clear and dumped all of my cash into safe and secure bank CD's.  Basically I have a low enough overhead to get through the 'hard times'.  I'll probably spend less, but not that much less.  The difference will be in savings.  From an average of $1,000 a month to savings it's going to be more like $250.00 a month.  I have no reason to borrow so that's not an issue.  On the national scene it's a different story.  Huge numbers of people cheered when the Bush Junta engaged us in two back to back wars with no natural stopping place....using borrowed money.  People forgot the biblical admonition of the 'seven fat years and the seven lean years'.  Now we're in the 'lean years', yet the bills and the needs go on.  Doing nothing certainly won't prevent further loses, but keeping at least a minimal number of wage-earners employed won't hurt.  I don't like further debt, but if you recall we were called 'un-american' when we insisted that we stay out of Iraq....Iraq, more than any other reason is the wedge that prevents us from dealing with our current financial problems.  If not for Iraq we'd have plenty of money to tied us over.  Granted, more debt will hurt us...but doing nothing will hurt even more.  If borrowed dollars will slow down this crash and keep people working then we're going to have to do that.  The next time someone suggests a war using borrowed money, grab 'em and pull their pants down, and certainly don't elect them to public office.  No kiddin'!|`|diDNl3BFaa	Go take a class in the difference between micro and macro economics please.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	The federal economy doesn't work like my household budget.<br>  <br>  Why do so many put this bogus notion forward?

I have always believed that the GOP's claim of a "big tent" rang a bit hollow. I'm one who believes that conservative principles benefit everyone, and I would love to see more black folks working in and with the Republicans. When you look at most regular black Americans, and listen to the things they believe in, it's difficult to understand why they religiously support the other party, a party which has promised them gold and given them manure for the past 60 years.<br>  <br>  Look at the marriage amendment in California this past election day. The majority of black and minority voters voted for keeping marriage between a man and a woman. To many of us, this is one small indication that deep down, most folks in minority communities (those who work, support families, have an education, etc) agree with conservatives on many issues. <br>  <br>  Abortion has always been a big issue in this country. Conservatives and Republicans generally tend to come down on the pro-life side. What I fail to understand is how the black community can support a man who regards having a child as something of a "burden" or a "mistake", and who supports abortion in any condition and even paid for with taxpayers dollars....when it's a known fact that a far greater percentage of black children than white are aborted in this country every year. There are entire generations of black babies that have been eliminated. Can you imagine what some of those babies might have been able to accomplish if they lived? Black Americans look at the days of slavery and Jim Crow as a deep wound in the history of this country, and they're right. Well, those things have been eliminated through our culture because of a lot of hard work and sacrifice. Why, then, do we continue to allow the holocaust that murders millions of black children before they even have a chance to be born?<br>  <br>  But, now I'm venting...<br>  <br>  The Republican Party needs black outreach. They have failed in this regard for years. maybe Mr. Steele's approach, while a bit novel, will get some people's attention.|`|YkseyT7zaa	You mean doing the same thing expecting different results isn't working?|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	Why draw the line there?

That the only reason Obama got it was that he was black.  And that now they will join the Republicans because Steele is black.<br>  Like...'See how much we really love black people"<br>  Its not going to work, streetwise, is streetwise.|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Republicans could start small - try telling the truth about something unimportant....

Let them know a little (very little if best) of what is going on and ask them to continue working with you whether or not your company moves them out. Have them ask for you and you alone. Too many clients to do that? Try sending a mass email or letter to them all. Of course, this option will only work if you have maintained strong relationships with your clients.<br>  <br>  I really recommend the last option. Above all else, however, continue to work hard because the transition period probably won't last for too long. It's not worth losing all of your clients because of a fear of losing some. Good luck.|`|ce6vV42Laa	I was in a simelar situation with a company I worked for. I was there for 3 years and a new manager was appointed. Since his appointment staff turnover went trough the roof and I ended up resigning myself. Sortly after my resignation, the new manager was sacked. <br>  I would agree with the previous post. Don't resign, but go over the managers head if you can. Good luck with this. <br>  One more bit of advice, try not to let it upset you too much. It's only a job.
JthubNIsaa	The Government is concerned about civil unrest and has an operation in place to handle any such. [It was originally set up to handle the possible disturbances when Obama either won/lost the election] They should be concerned going forward. I give it about 18 months maybe 2 years.

If they feel that he will be a danger to the child in any way, they could prevent that.  However, no matter how much he hates "you", the courts are acting on behalf of the child.  So, if he doesn't hit the child or he doesn't do drugs or he is not a danger to himself or the child, then the courts will grant him visitation.  However, what you can shoot for is "supervised visitation".  <br>  But overall, just because he said what he said in the email, that is not legal justification that he is denied visitation.

4a2b4c38598195f530e54c08fa3e232aaa	I am really tired of all these answers saying that Obama didn't write the stimulus.  Seriously, people.  He didn't actually get out and write with his own hand writing.  But it was his recommendations and got the stimulus bill written.  Please stop repeating Rushisms.  <br>  <br>  And answer to you question.  No I don't think it would still be okay.|`|AA11581903	Bad taste is unfortunately common now and people in the media are always too quick to comment on things. This is what happens when news media and entertainment mix...<br>  <br>    You have a situation now where news is packaged to try to get a laugh or get noticed. Its not enough to comment on things as they are anymore but rather to make it entertaining so that ratings will go up or papers will sell.<br>  <br>   Its not o.k. but it is now the norm in how we perceive the world. This draws attention which in turn gets a publication or program more money. Inappropriate behavior or material draws our eyes and ears.<br>  <br>    The chimp comic is no different from a skit on a sitcom or some off handed comment on American Idol. It is simply to draw us in.<br>  <br>  None of it is right but it is virtually impossible to escape it.|`|G2auAv1Saa	If we did live in the America you describe in your question- no I don't think anyone other than animal activists and anti-gun folks would have an issue with it and it would be for those respective reasons.<br>  <br>  -I do think that was the tacky part about it, is that this incident just happened and the woman is still in the hospital in critical condition.<br>  -I don't think this was directed toward Obama, according to the text it was directed toward the writers of the stimulus.<br>  <br>   I think this writer did it in a poor manner but I guarantee you, he knew it would get attention, sell a few more copies and put his name out there- and he was right!|`|l5cxmTb9aa	I'm not black so I suppose my opinion will be discounted. If there was never any race issue I don't see where it would be an issue. If the same thing played in Denmark 5 years ago after a similar political upheaval and Chimp attack it'd be a real stretch to call it racist.<br>  <br>  I suppose many younger people have never heard the line about a million monkeys with a million typewriters so that may be in play here too. It's been so long that I can't even remember the exact quote.<br>  <br>  EDIT: A lot of people are commenting on whether it's in bad taste. Taste is totally subjective so I can't say. People told jokes after the two shuttle disasters. Bad taste?<br>  When will we start regulating what is appropriate? I read a report on MIchael Moore's movie lies today. It's so full of lies and midirection that it's embarassing. Should it be censored also?

It simply meant that the monkey that wrote the bill was shot and killed and another one would be needed in order to write anymore of these types of bills. It was a joke. Putting it another way, a trained monkey could have written the thing. Of course, the libs had to make it a racial thing.|`|09aGRz8paa	no, the cartoon was not okay it's wrong on many levels and it's lame.<br>  <br>  what if the lady that was attacked saw it - oh wait, she can't see it because she has no eyes and you can't explain it to her because the chimp ripped off her ears.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	The liberals have called Bush every name there is and made fun of him since day 1.

2lFRYr8Eaa	Not illegal, but very hard on many cars.  The anti-theft devices are often included in the key head, and the ignition has to connect with the proper key.  I not sure how it works but a key itself will not start the car.<br>  <br>  My daughter bought a Honda, used, that had such a key, but the ignition went out, the guy had the device taken out of the key and placed in the steering wheel so that the car thinks any proper key is the right one.

He need to ask to the ship Corpsman to send him to the VA Hospital for a MRI or X rays.|`|OiAl6w48aa	I don't see what there is TO DO at this point.  First off, the military does not have any duty to inform you every time he is injured on the job.  Its the military - by definition its hazardous.  Second, the fact that he was not properly diagnosed does not mean that you have any rights to sue.  If anybody was harmed by this, its your husband, not you.  Third, as far as him being fit for duty, there's been no findings yet, so there's nothing to contest at this point.  <br>  <br>  For now, I think you have to wait and see how it plays out.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	KEY ISSUE: If they try to remove him from duty, he should not sign anything that does not include 100% disability. Not 99% or less, 100% is the key! You have no legal right to sue, on his behalf, as long as he is mentally competent and alive.|`|raImBqwraa	He is entitled to disability compensation from the military. You aren't entitled to s**t. You cannot sue on his behalf. Dependents can only sue the military for injuries THEY incur because of the military (Usually malpractice at military medical facilities). <br>  <br>  Hope your husband gets taken care of by the VA - let me know if he needs any help with that. I work in a law firm that is very, very good at filing and appealing veteran's claims.|`|JSFCkne8aa	Go back to school and learn how to properly form a sentence.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	You can try to sue but you will probably not win your case.  What you can do is have your husband's neurologist write a letter explaining what is wrong and how this is a direct result of something that happened while your husband was on active duty.  Your husband can then go to the legal office at his duty station and they can arrange for him to receive a portion of his pay for the rest of his life (and possibly some convalescent leave if his Dr. writes that in the letter) because of the accident.<br>  <br>  One of my husband's friends (husband is in the Air Force) is getting 50% of his E-5 base pay as a civilian because his Dr. said he has sleep apnea.

If you have any medical issues, you won't get a large enough award to do any good.<br>  <br>  Hire a lawyer and go to common pleas court.<br>  <br>  If you do sue on your own, make sure you sue everyone you can think of (KMART, the manager of the store that day, etc.)  so you don't loose out on any of your claims.<br>  <br>  You will most likely be facing KMARTS attorney's, depending on the corporate structure of the company.  However, KMART and the management service may be represented by the same company.

AA10447191	Universal means within the US.<br>  International means out of the US|`|AA12365543	Why should they get tax funded healthcare? All Africans do is leech off other nations rather than better themselves. Let them solve there own problems rather than extend it with more "aid" that just gets put in corrupt politicians swiss bank accounts|`|zI3YXvGLaa	in this case universal refers to just the US.|`|5781cee19923e98aad5a257688d6e71faa	there is a lot of nastiness and hatred here.<br>  <br>  First, it is a silly question since universal healthcare refers to the application of healthcare to all those living in the US.<br>  <br>  "Universal health care is health care coverage that is extended to all eligible residents of a governmental region and often covers medical, dental, and mental health care. These programs vary in their structure and funding mechanisms. Typically, most costs are met via single-payer health care system or national health insurance. Universal health care is implemented in all wealthy, industrialized countries, except for the United States.  It is also provided in many developing countries and is the trend worldwide."<br>  <br>  About the 'illegal immigrants' comments, which are completely misleading and unfounded ignorance - have you actually done any research as to how much 'illegal' immigrants pay in taxes?  and how they are essentially propping up the Social Security system?  Please do your research before disseminating racist nonsense.<br>  <br>  As for Africa, there are many countries on that particular continent.  We give aid to most of those countries, including aid to prevent diseases and create better healthcare facilities.  So do many, many other countries.  The reason so many of these countries still lack basic healthcare has to do with corrupt leaderships and wars that have devastated areas that were previously prosperous.  Many of these countries are still recovering from the colonization by Europeans who did a great deal of damage with their divide and conquer rule.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	If rights are equal then there can't be a right for someone to incur bills that others will be forced to pay.<br>  <br>  If you support universal healthcare fine but don't then insist that you support equal rights - you don't.    Somebody has to pay for it.   That means whoever has a right to it without having to pay for it is being elevated above those who have to pay for it.   That's not equal.   Thus to support "universal healthcare" is to oppose equal rights.<br>  <br>  And why does "universal" mean "in the US" - why doesn't it mean US CITIZENS?<br>  <br>  There are allegedly 41 million people in the US without health insurance.<br>  <br>  There are between 12 and 20 million illegal immigrants.<br>  <br>  There are millions more poor legal immigrants who lack health insurance.<br>  <br>  Here's a big tip - over half of the ranks of the uninsured in the US are NOT CITIZENS.<br>  <br>  So STOP calling the issue "Americans without health insurance."

Many Liberals saw clearly that Repubs were fixing the books to falsely give themselves justification to invade and go to war with Iraq.

I am one of the few people who doesn't have the worries that most Americans do & I never paid attention to politics until a year ago. I have always been against doing anything that involves treating someone in a way I wouldn't want to be treated. No, I would never want a loved one to go to war or end up with any of the consequences that can come from this. So I am a liberal against war. In the past four-six months my focus has been on the economy more than the war. I thought things were being taken care of in the highest & best way. President Obama did not start this so I don't hold him responsibile for any of the mess he is cleaning up. I think if you think liberals don't care it might be that we are people who may not have the time to keep up with everything as well as you & many others are able to do. To say we don't care b/c of the person's party in charge is ridiculous though. I have seen President Obama do so much in the month he has been in office that I guess I am not going to jump all over him about anything which again has nothing to do with him being a dem.

DnzL2zWQaa	You are right, the sense of entitlement is out of control.  Owning a house is not a right.  If you don't make enough money to qualify - you shouldn't be able to buy one.  Same with every other item on your list.  <br>  <br>  However, as long as Obama is in office, this sense of entitlement will get worse.  I don't believe we should share the wealth - you get what you deserve.  Everyone has an equal opportunity to get educated, find a job and save money to accomplish goals.  If you derail yourself - you have no one but yourself to blame.|`|5hxWSezPaa	There is no such thing as an "entitlement" except for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You have to earn the rest.|`|YJ2S747oaa	Maybe bankers need to have a sense of morality and ethics, too. STFU.|`|cMHxg372aa	Yes, the entitlement mentality in this country is totally out of control. However, it is the wealthy who possess it; those who believe every dime they can skim off in the financial markets is "earned," and that they are entitled to it.<br>  <br>  "We have people buying houses, cars and other things they have no ability or desire to pay for."<br>  <br>  Hmmm... Interesting. It's almost as if ability to pay is willfully neglected. Perhaps it's because output needs to be distributed in accordance with contributions to production (hence stagnant incomes and rising indebtedness), and this phenomenon occurs because the rich have rigged the financial system in their favor? It's either that or the glorious free market has failed to allocate resources efficiently.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	Yes. The fact that Wall St., banks, large corporations,etc believe they are entitled to our money has gone far enough. Time to take their lumps like everyone else.

Cannabis isn't. Why? Because Cannabis can be grown from the comfort of your own home, therefore, impossible for the government to regulate fully and tax appropriately.

uvWH4Ioyaa	The death of a person accused of a crime terminates all further criminal prosecution. If a claim is made in civil court for damages as a result of conduct that could be prosecuted as a crime, the estate of the decedent can be held liable for those damages.

You are innocent until proven guilty and the state has the very heavy burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	No U.S. jurisdiction will try a dead person for a crime.

But it offended me, not because I am a Republican, but because I am a soldier. I administer a lot of oaths for enlistment and reenlistment I have always considered this a solemn duty. I once attended a reenlistment ceremony where the Navy LT officiating giggled his way through giving the oath. By the time I finished with him after the ceremony he knew to take these things seriously. They mean something. And they especially mean something to the soldier receiving the oath and his family members.     Sorry, little rant.|`|bmCInR5qaa	No.

A:~)|`|G2auAv1Saa	It is fascinating really that democrats think this. I have listened to his show about once in my life and many of my friends have never listened to him. My parents never heard of him until democrats started claiming this. We as a whole don't really listen to him or value his opinion that much. Some things I have heard him say make sense, but they are overshadowed by all the crazy things he says and the way he says them. I heard a news report yesterday trying to figure out why people are saying this and no one could find a Republican who listened to him... just Democrats.   Saying he is the think tank of the GOP is like saying Jesse Jackson is the democrats think tank.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	He isn't.  The Democrats fascination with Rush Limbaugh is mind-boggling.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	You are welcome to your opinion.    And we didn't need Rush to warn us about Obama.

Rush is the think tank, why?  Because all those other "think tanks" on the GOP side have been totally ineffectual.  Rush has pulled the whole cart when any progress has been made.  And he has made considerable progress!    And  Rush is physcho.  Yes, you spelled physcho correctly.      The dictionary definition of "physcho", which I remember from playing street ball in Trenton for fifteen years, is a person who gets into the head of the opponent, who f**ks him up big time.  Rush is definitely physching Obama.      Great question, I HOPE you like my answer!   If not I can CHANGE it.|`|ShhOXGuQaa	do you mean the physcho who is making 400 million dollars??? don't bite the hand that literally feeds you...Rush, unlike all of Obama's appointees, pays his taxes so all you democrats can milk it for all it's worth..YOU'RE WELCOME!!!|`|7ny2EjjHaa	Did you mean psycho?

The 17th amendment did away with this by allowing for direct election of senators (yet who really votes for senators in off years?)     One of the 1st two articles in the bill of rights (the other had to due with Congression pay raises) that were not adopted limited Representatives' constituents to 30,000.  The Representatives' duty was to protect the right of the electorate.    There was also an electorate who cared about issues and valued what they had at stake and didn't let US Weekly popularity contests decide who they would vote for.    Too bad we've fallen away from these ideals.  If they were re-instated, there would be no need for term limits.|`|SaxjkMbSaa	Yes......Obama's term should be limited to the same 143 days that he served as Senator.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	Yes, but the problem is that it's a state issue, and though some states will propose this, others will not.

If Barack Obama had applied for a CEO position in the private sector with only 143 days of experience; Obama would have been told ' come back in 10 years when you get  more experience and apply again '    So.....America  should have known enough to tell Obama ' come back in 10 years after you get  more experience and apply again '.|`|k6hicodfaa	Ah, you also mentioned education and training.

For example, as we have seen, some individuals who have had executive experience have run their companies into the ground.

An individual who possesses intelligence, good ideas, knowledge, the ability to analyze, vision and who has energy may be an excellent choice if given the opportunity.

Also, if someone becomes a lobbyist after working in the administration, they are prohibited from lobbying the administration for 12 months on matters on which they worked.    Dsachle was not a lobbyist. He was an adviser and not registered as a lobbyist.  He has however stated that he would recuse himself from matters that presented a conflict of interest.

There is not much to help the mortgage foreclosure problem, and it seems like some unnecessary pork in it. I'm a liberal, not a socialist, and  at this time I would have a problem supporting this.|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	Lets look at it like this:    Mother: hey timmy, I was wondering if they taught you at school what socialism was?  Timmy: Yes mother, they said it would save the country and help everyone.  Mother: okay, we're going to start praticing it in our house. So give me all your toys back.  Timmy: (horrified look) WHAT?! why!? no. they're mine!  Mother: There are kids out there with no toys, besides we're now socialist so everything that is ours belongs to everyone else as well.  Timmy: can we stop being socialist now?      Next example:    Dad: hey timmy, what do you think of this mim wage thing ? they want to raise it.  Timmy: I think it's great! When I'm albe to go to work I'll make 10 bucks an hour at least! that's so cool and fair!  Dad: okay Timmy. . . what do you think the company's think of it?  Timmy: doesn't matter what they think, my teacher in school says the company's are run by evil mony grubbing men.  Dad: So lets say it was you running a company. . . you had to pay 10 people 10 dollars an hour.  You look at your stats and you can run your area with only 6 people. Would you keep those 4 people and bring up your own profits?  Timmy: sure, more money for me then.   Dad: When it's time for you to go get a job all those companys will be firing people and not hiring, so. ..   Timmy: You mean I wont be able to get a job??  Dad: most likely not an intro level type job.   Timmy: then I don't like that idea.    From my point of view:  Do i really want 500-1000 dollars going to non-taxpaying people and illegal immgrants? NO.  Do I really think that spending money you don't have creates money and jobs? NO.  Do I really think we're in a great depression? er. . . history tells us No we're not, gov't is just trying to scare us into thinking we are. But yes we are in hard times. ..  there will always be hard times, that doesn't mean we need gov't to bail us out every time. The American way was to work hard for you want.    During the great depression The Dem Party decided to toss money at it to get it to end (omg, you mean we've ALREADY tried what they want to do and it's NOT NEw?? damn those history books, now I know why Obama doesn't think history is important.)  The man who ran the treasury department at the time of the great depression said: "we've tried throwing money at it, we've thrown more money then ever at it. . . it isn't working."    So all my views come from the FACT that everything they WANT to do now with this package has been tried. . . and has FAILED.  It's all in the history text books.      Btw. .. I'm from neither party, I don't hate Obama, I just don't think he's good for this country, he's great for himself and getting himself ahead.|`|iFWppBSQaa	I think the keynesian model of "spending" your way out of trouble no longer carries the weight it once did. This current crisis has highlighted the need for fiscal policy to have equal effect on the population not just those who are immensely rich.    The current policy of bailing out those company that have lost billions due to poor credit management will be unsustainable and will burden future tax payers whom are not to blame. However, at the moment it seems to be the only option to keep liquidity in a failing financial system.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	I think it's a big old pork entree with a small side of stimulus|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	it won't work and will hurt us people who have saved money instead of borrowing by making the dollar lose its value.

If they were truly going to "give us back our money" then why don't they just cut out the middleman and just not take it to start with in an attempt to stimulate the economy?

Absolutely ridiculous.|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	thumbs down on the stimulus package.|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	This bill is nothing but a spending bill and it does absolutely nothing for the economy.

He admitted that this bill has a lot of crap in it and that they are unsure if it will stimulate the economy.  Then why did you vote for it you idiot!|`|DNaMIcomaa	I am very concerned about the supposed amount of so called pork that has been injected into the bill.  I want a long term Democratic majority and adding pet projects into something as important as a stimulus package is not going to get votes in 2010.     I am also concerned that there is not enough "bricks and mortar" job creation included in the bill.Getting the middle class back on it's feet with GOOD paying jobs should be the first priority of an effective stimulus package.Tax cuts alone will only create the same low paying jobs that we have been getting since the eighties.    Another concern is that NO Republicans voted for the bill in Congress.I am very concerned about partisan gridlock ,something that Barack Obama said that he would work to break in his campaign,and when I see one party in Congress vote strictly along party lines that tells me that Republicans are not willing to give up the antics of the last thirty years.At least 11 Democrats voted different than the majority.    I am also concerned that IF there is pork in the bill. How much of it is pork. Republicans claim that 66% is pork or non-stimulus.A claim that I doubt. But what is the truth why is it so hard for politicians to abandon ideology and partisan posturing? Tell me and the rest of America the truth and ALL of you forget about party for the good of the country.|`|IBXElKCTaa	Short and sweet... Stupid plan with a lot of nothing...

The United States is too fond of killing people in order to achieve its objectives. You call it war, but today's wars are not about professional soldiers fighting and killing each other. It is about killing people, ordinary innocent people by the hundreds of thousands. Whole countries will be devastated. War is primitive, the cavemen's way of dealing with a problem. Stop your arms build up and your planning for future wars.     2- Stop indiscriminate support of Israeli killers with your money and your weapons. The planes and the bombs killing the people of Gaza are from you.     3- Stop applying sanctions against countries which cannot do the same against you. In Iraq your sanctions killed 500,000 children through depriving them of medicine and food. Others were born deformed. What have you achieved with this cruelty? Nothing except the hatred of the victims and right-thinking people.     4- Stop your scientists and researchers from inventing new and more diabolical weapons to kill more people more efficiently.     5- Stop your arms manufacturers from producing them. Stop your sales of arms to the world. It is blood money that you earn. It is un-Christian.     6- Stop trying to democratize all the countries of the world. Democracy may work for the United States but it does not always work for other countries. Don't kill people because they are not democratic. Your crusade to democratize countries has killed more people than the authoritarian Governments which you overthrew. And you have not succeeded anyway.     7- Stop the casinos which you call financial institutions. Stop hedge funds, derivatives and currency trading. Stop banks from lending non-existent money by the billions. Regulate and supervise your banks. Jail the miscreants who made profits from abusing the system.     8- Sign the Kyoto Protocol and other international agreements.     Note: this is actually a letter from Dr. Mahathir to President Barrack Obama.|`|0982b83a0496946be27e0be6e067b757aa	Immediately become a neutral country same as Switzerland.

That definitely crosses the line from a democratic government to a communist government.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	The democrats are working on documents to eliminate term limits, yes|`|xaV4LGBAaa	if so it will not happen|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	There is talk about a proposal to repeal the amendment. I doubt it would pass.    Scary thought tho...could end up with a leader like Castro or some other nut job.|`|AA10465540	That is a rumor that has circulated about every president that has taken office since FDR.|`|nhFsl1JTaa	This bill has been introduced by the same group of democrat and republican congresscritters every congressional session for the last couple decades. This is not an Obama-focused bill, just like it wasn't a Bush 43 bill, and wasn't a Clinton bill, and wasn't a Bush 41 bill.    But could you even imagine Bush being able to STEAL election indefinitely?  This country may not survive 2 stolen terms there is no possible way the country could have survived another 4 years of Bush.    I have no idea why these same Congresscritters keep trying to get this bill passed.|`|R7Hexutqaa	This is no different than Republicans proposing an amendment to allow a naturalized citizen to hold the office in order to accommodate the Governator.    This will go no where for a variety of reasons.  Among them:  1.  The 2 term limit has served well.  (But in the end was probably un necessary - what President could have won a third term in the last 50 years? Other than Eisenhower we did not have a 2-term president until Reagan.  Reagan was slipping into Alzheimer's, Clinton burned all his Political capital in Monica-Gate, Bush had the lowest of low ratings)  2.  The amendment if passed would likely not apply to the sitting President, but be reserved for future presidents.  This takes the 'conflict of interest'  issue off the table.|`|d48b0cce8366a9573fefff374501246aaa	Noway!|`|BHBQPFzlaa	No, this is not true.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	I knew it, before the vote. Bloomberg set the precedent.   It will never happen.   The "stimulus" package has less than 40% approval...
5HYabirzaa	Yes, it is very unfair and wrong. A lot of people tend to abuse their power just to make their "team" look good. I hope they do a thorough investigation, and boot the boss out.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Are you sure many agents aren't "bilingual" Mexican descent and turning their backs?|`|Ar7swtCPaa	First they actually have to allow these people to be able to effectively do their jobs. Immigration is out of control and somewhere along the line it needs to be controlled. There are laws that are being neglected to appease a few...|`|XRYAfxpTaa	It is the influx of illegal aliens to this nation that is and has been out of control for years. The capabilities of enforcement agents should be enhanced. There should be a national quota to remove all persons illegally in the US.|`|BgExwcvMaa	Of coarse you are omitting the fact that most immigration raids stem from ID fraud investigations. But then that would diminish the point you're trying to make, wouldn't it? How many times has the Highway Patrol been accused of quotas for giving out tickets? However in California close your eyes, throw a rock, and you will more than likely hit a business that hires illegals.|`|LRbxal5Faa	It is a tough problem that is showing the cracks and strains of decades of hoping it will go away if we ignore it hard enough. Instead, big surprise, it has consistently gotten worse and worse until 150 arrests and two prosecutions a month is next to nothing for a Canadian border patrol. It is absolutely nothing for a border patrol on any stretch of the Mexican border.    Before your heart bleeds all over my keyboard, what do you know about the impact of this phenom in the countries south of the US border? Do you know about the millions of abandoned families? Do you know about the gangs being formed by children who are being raised by money instead of parents? About elderly grandparents who are doing their best to raise the abandoned children without the benefit of family structure?    Yes, it is undoubtedly an ugly solution. It is still not as ugly as the problem - on both sides of the border. Do you have prettier solutions or are you just looking for an opportunity to criticize from your armchair?|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Why would this put US citizens at risk of arrest? US citizens can prove their status very easily.|`|bA4ucVDTaa	yup! and it makes my stomach turn just thinking about it.|`|zgmMoDmIaa	This Questionis out of control, its a statement not a Question and if I were to answer I would say NO|`|lnzcL1nfaa	people that are in control should be monitored a lot closer so stuff like this doesn't happen. I'm surprised that this didn't wait to be aired until a Politician's family member was falsely arrested.|`|BVhIrPeAaa	This is very disgusting and it is abuse of power.|`|wMh38OzVaa	Obama is going to fix everything Bush did and get our country back on course.So it has been predicted/so shall it be.so says the Demacratic party|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	I believe most law enforcement agencies have quotas.  The reason is to keep them at peak performance, and make sure they are not just riding around sight seeing.  As far as "this agency is about looking good". They'd better be. Apprehending illegals is their job!    EDIT: Gwen r- you made a very good point about the impact of the family situation in MX.  I will add one thing. What messge are the parents giving their children? Money! Money! Money! " Money is so important I will leave you with whatever relative will take you so I can go make money and buy you things you don't need".|`|qZ1wEDPpaa	Typical.... You see something like this and right away jump on the implications for your beloved illegals..    Real Question should be..    Are Americans pissed off that illegal immigrants are causing a loss of civil liberties?|`|FpioJ7F5aa	Nope.  They don't arrest American Citizens with identification.  Clearly we have an emergency situation down on the border... carry your I.D. until we get all of the fence in place, and we control the inland areas.  But then.. you should carry your I.D. anyway!!    No problems with it.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	No|`|I8M5kw5Saa	no and I would like to take it further for every illegal that a BP picks up there should be a monetary bonus.And if you are an American you will have nothing to worry about now would you.I bet we would have lots being sent back then.Maybe I will call my congressman tomorrow and give him this idea.|`|trQ4vqx4aa	Nah, it's cool.
7jNYqtWOaa	Chaplains have great people skills and listen well, which is what detectives do...they also know how to extract confessions that are legal.    I'd still recommend being a military cop first.  At least you'll learn law enforcement as well as state and federal laws; things that are important as a detective.|`|AA10709853	it will neither help nor hurt.   your military service, regardless of MOS will be the thing in your favor getting into a Police academy.   that and some require a 4 year degree.|`|AA11593134	What does chaplais assistant to do with being a detective? I think those two are as different as they can be...!
AA11163314	The only people who will benefit will be the special interest groups that support the Democratic Party.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	This will be nothing like the Bush stimulus bills. We will get nothing except higher taxes.  Thanks to everyone who voted for Obama.|`|AA11106831	The politicians because they will say that they did something.  As for part two you have got to be kidding.|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	As the stimulus is currently written,Government will benefit the most and I'd be willing to bet that not one penny is ever paid back.     It is worth taking the time to read the plan and you will be amazed at what a joke it is.|`|Q7ovix19aa	The government will benefit because you won't be paid back.  The will give your money and keep any repayment.  You and most other people don't try to stop them so they continue that practice.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	The funds will not be paid back to the people, we will owe more money to pay off the increasing debt.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	The government will benefit the most

DEglvDGDaa	yes absolutely true the grand mufti commanded the largest non german division of the SS made up of Bosnian muslims who butchered serbs hence the balkans war..    they also personally escorted hundreds of thousands of gypsies, jews, slavs to the gas chamber.    they even had their won flag wuch was the palestinian flag interwined with the swastika    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Waffen...    http://stosstruppen39-45.tripod.com/id10...    http://www.tellthechildrenthetruth.com/g...    http://video.google.com/videosearch?oe=U...|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	nope they had to be Germanic peoples    I don't think being a Muslim German was a very common thing back then    Sorry I am German and a Muslim|`|aIakDSstaa	Yes there were Bosnian Muslims in the Nazi SS, they were called Hanjar (Saber) Division many were hand picked by Hitler himself. They fought Yugoslav partisans in Bosnia. There were around 70,000 of them.|`|i6d582PFaa	no that's a lie    empire of the city    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0KzMrneE...|`|C8Djjxqkaa	The Waffen-SS maintained several "Foreign Legions" of personnel from conquered territories and countries allied to Germany. The majority wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix Waffen instead of SS. Racial restrictions were relaxed to the extent that Ukrainian Slavs, Albanians from Kosovo, and Turkic Tatars' units were recruited. I wouldn't call that "many."|`|sLEdPDkHaa	yes and when it comes down to it some Muslims have the same cause as Nazis|`|eSodtiniaa	Other answerers are wrong. it is well documented that there were a number of SS Muslim Divisions.  http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/yugoslav...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Waffen...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Waffen...  http://freerepublic.com/focus/news/74715...|`|44AkhdRnaa	Yes there was a Muslim SS division.    SS Handschar    "the Germans were hoping to rally the World's 350 million Muslims to their side, in a struggle against the British Empire. The creation of a Muslim, albeit European Muslim Division, was considered a stepping stone to this greater end."|`|a0YeSoBEaa	the 13th waffen mountain division was made up of muslims in its entirety|`|jbE1nWqzaa	Not sure... but there is one thing common in them - hatred for Jews.|`|m2zXOREJaa	They were all Asylum seekers in 45.lol|`|wxcmnFEKaa	There were from Bosna, but not really a large percentage.|`|61YfPllfaa	Yes it is true. and they wore a red fez instead of a forage cap.....sounds bizzar?....well its true.. Hitler had quite a number of muslim divs.......not just SS.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Yes, they allied together.  The Nazis and Islamofascists actually have a  similar goal.  They both have hegemony and their own master plans,  just the Islamofascists have a "religious twist."    While Hitler and his army were defeated and "checkmated" by allied forces, the Muslims that allied with Hitler weren't even "checked."     The modern world has had problems with Communism, Nazism, and now Islamofascism.  One cannot make peace with a hostile regime to Western values, but defend against those values we reject, and sometimes go to war over it if the other party becomes hegemonious.  The German civilians were not immune to allied bombs when we targeted Hitler's troops, and neither are the Muslims. Civilians that supported the Hitler regime casualties were in the MILLIONS.  Societies are responsible for the monsters they create, and they suffer the consequences of their own actions, or inaction. We went to war with Nazi Germany and defeated them, Reagan stood up to the Russian Communists  and did a Cold War stand off and finally decided to disarm, and now the decision is being made what to do with the Islamofascists.

Even allowing that to be an overstimate, this means that 99.75% of troops enlisted in the Nazi cause were not Muslim.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Absolutely false - no muslim at all.|`|aCdya2qkaa	I like to make a correction    In 1943 of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin el-Husseini reviewing Bosnian-Muslim troops - a unit of the "Hanjar (Saber) Division" of the Waffen SS which he personally recruited for Hitler.|`|hkLdUjznaa	Yes - the SS recruited 2 divisions from the bosnian muslims in WW2.|`|35b87fceeaf43fa20d38991c7cd6a746aa	There were Muslims from the Balkans in the Waffen SS - not really large numbers though. An example is the 13th Waffen Gebirgsdivision der S.S.|`|liJKE5B2aa	A large number of catholics.|`|AA12181502	I'd like to concur with ello guvo & doctor deathrow,  Himmler apparently approved as they saw fighting to death as a way into heaven!  By this stage in the war the initial criteria for the Waffen SS had largely become a joke, as theres no way these dudes could have proved Aryan lineage for 5 generations!|`|jqLWuLkDaa	Yes, absolutely.|`|bOOk0WV7aa	its a lie.
EPqnB7Epaa	Relax, all the Republican Senators are trying to do is get some of the excessive and unnecessary spending out of the stimulus package.  I don't care what your party affiliation is, surely you can see that some of this money is NOT going to the intended cause of stimulating the economy.|`|VBunjbhKaa	They know it is bad and they dont want their fingerprints on it.  Are you suggesting they do what they think is wrong, just to go along with the crowd?    I dont know why it matters so much to libs anyway, because the republicans arent needed to pass this through.    btw..........I am happy that they are FINAL:LY listening to their constituents.|`|SSLekPAnaa	I applaud my reps. for impeding Obama. Nothing good will come out of this stimulus package. Even Democrats know this. Obama's approval rating is sinking faster then the Titanic! The GOP's is rising? And why do you think this is? Americans are finally getting it, that the Democrats don't understand what is going on, and only the GOP does.|`|2aERh7hlaa	I'm glad to see the house GOP standing up and in one voice say NO! to the Dem's wish list and with public support eroding for the stimulus It places the blame on the majority for not coming up with something that the public believes will work....Keep up the Good work guys.|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	They are standing up for what we believe to be right and true.  They are allowing the Dem.s enough rope to hang themselves.    We look at historical facts such as Clinton's NAFTA sending all of our jobs overseas and know that his actions were the foundation for today's economy.  We see this current "stimulus" package and recognize that it's laden with pork for Dem.s pet projects that offer up nothing towards helping the economy out of the slump.    We're not quick to jump on whatever bandwagon happens around the corner.  And, the last thing you would want to hear is our crying about having been lied to after we voted in favor of and then watched it all fail to achieve the intended goals.|`|AA10124869	The Republicans needed a serious reality check on getting religion about conservative/libertarian principles (the two have many parallels as made evident by Reagan in Reason magazine in '75).     The persistent desire to be "Democrat light" didn't bode well for them in 2006 as well as in 2008.    The House Republicans were dead on in opposing the Obama stimulus bill because having done so, while at the same time offering a plan of their own, draws a clear and distinct difference between the differing ideologies of each party whereas this distinction was less profound previously.    The Senate Republicans on the other hand are showing signs of once again going "Democrat light" in trying to "tweak" the Obama stimulus plan to such an extent that they'd be able to vote for it.    They should oppose it to (again while at the same time offering a different plan of their own).|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	When the Republicans were in power no one asked the Democrats why they were trying to stop legislation they didn't believe in.  I find this new idea that Republicans should kiss the new President's bootie even if they don't agree with him beyond disturbing. What they will achieve is representing the 48% of this country that is fiscally conservative.  They deserve representation too even if they're on the losing side in the end.|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	It is about time they showed they have some balls.   They need to oppose this rampant spending and the move toward socialism or as conservatives we will vote their sorry butts out of office.  I hope they continue to obstruct any plan that jeopardizes our liberties or the constitution.   In order for the Republican party to remain legitimate they must stand up for the values and issues of conservatism.|`|botH6rIQaa	The stimulus bill is loaded with pork,  which is not an uncommon practice in our government,  However,  this legislation was designed for government aid to failing financial institutions.  Hidden in this bill is 600 million for new government vehicles,  1 billion for updating heat and air conditioning systems in government buildings,  and many more.  To eliminate the pork and trim the financial aid is the proper thing to do.  The aid should be coming in the form of tax relief and checks to the people,  given that,  the economy would rebound quickly.
0TT5q0cUaa	you should have seen what happened when the nuclear deal was in discussion. the parliament becomes a reality tv show with alliances.|`|cWuumdy7aa	presently There are two alliances UPA and NDA. Before the poll they will try to get as many allies as possible based on seat sharing basis.But after the poll in case of Hung parliament the group with larger seat will try to woo various parties to come and join as post poll allies|`|rCr3uqt9aa	Yes and they should made compulsory to follow the alliances till next election so that people of India will not be cheated.   Post poll alliances is nothing but horse-trading .political party betray people by forming coalition with political rivals .Example : people of west Bengal voted C.P.M against Congress the mandate was clear against congress  but what C.P.M leaders Prakash Karat and party did ? They have refrain mandate and supported congress in centre.(Voters of Bengal helplessly watching the drama .What else they can do after casting their vote for C.P.M  with faith ? ) This and so many unprincipled alliance takes place after poll. People casts their vote once in election but M.P and M.LA can use this power several time for own profit ignoring people and their mandate.|`|9SgoJ4aDaa	not necessary|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	It is most unpredictable thing b coz politicians change colours fast like chameleons.|`|GllB4mPZaa	U R on the right track.They should do it.But upa has declared to not do so.I think nda w'll do it.Others r looking for the horses to ride.|`|7uVjp0QKaa	That is what they keep doing all the time .|`|4cc1b8d74140b7740c7010fde32f09d9aa	Alliance, for what??   To gain the power(every party is fearing to loose)?   To get hold of the Public Money paid in taxes(every party is accepting that it is good to eat the money together with opponents rather loosing this chance by fighting)?   To exploit the 70% common countrymen?    There is no effect on Indian common people rather parties make alliance before the elections or after it. They are most likely to change their decision once offered a "best price" by other group of corrupts, criminals & money hungry 'so called leaders'. Most of the small political parties are looking to make alliance after the election because that way they can bargain more for power and money.    No Party in India represent 'INDIA'... they only represent different casts, religions and categories... all they are trying their best to divide the common people of India for their own means. This was exactly done by the 'Englishmen' and after 1947 congress and followed by other parties. Today, evils are united (or trying to be unite) but 'goods' are not, WHY? Because 'Goods' are always ruled by evils and evils are not letting them out of the problems of Roti, Kapra aur Makan. They never wanted and will never want to sort out the issues related to common poor people who mostly are good.    What I want to say is "WE, COMMON PEOPLE OF INDIA MUST MAKE ALLIANCE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS AND CHOOSE GOOD PEOPLE".|`|jgRRsG8Daa	Long,long ago and much earlier political parties formed alliances to   fight elections and common enemies in the political arena.Nowadays,  there are no alliances but(what I prefer to call)gangs.They gang up to swallow smaller parties.Presently there are three gangs with a fourth one looming large.The NDA,UPA and the UNPA.The new front or the back (because everyone has to watch his back which is where the knife is sheathed) will include the three film star parties of the south.Vijaykant,Sarath Kumar and Chiranjeevi have their outfits.Of the lot,Chiru's party,known as Praja Rajyam seems to be a front runner and  a dark horse likely to make its presence felt with a bang.The other two turned out to be damp squibs.Rajnikant may also try his hand but is  scared that he will get drubbed which may then sound his own death  knell.With the rebels(those who will be denied tickets for the forthcoming elections by the major parties)joining the fray we can expect the fifth gang to take birth.We can then see a regular gang war   but the winner may not be able to take the spoils because there will be nothing to take.Everyone will end up as the loser,with the people being the biggest losers.
dSbAz63baa	Never compare a marine with a Ranger. marines are trained to be the first in an all out offensive, Rangers are trained to sneak in sneak out and never be seen. Were on a completely different level. Go marines, Excel become Force Recon or go Army, Excel and become a Ranger. Never settle being basic in any branch.    Edit:) If all marines were infantry, they wouldn't have the 0300 Infantry (MOS) Thats a complete insult and many marine infantryman will agree. There's a huge difference between a "rifleman" and a "Infantryman"|`|3xTNOevjaa	Join the Navy, and become a SEAL. They goto combat alot in Iraq and all, it should be best for you.|`|NZuJR79oaa	In today's Military the Marines are used most often for combat. Every Marine is an infantryman first and their specialty second.|`|i6d582PFaa	watch this first    empire of the city    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0KzMrneE...|`|LwPcGpAOaa	Evan, you should meet a couple of vets in person and talk about what its really like to see combat.  Its not all glory like on TV.  Its pain and suffering and you will not be a hero.  Most likely you will not be fighting for freedom you will be fighting for the political agenda of who ever is in office.  I respect all that have served.  This is just my view.  Good Luck.|`|tvQStwpGaa	Alright, I don't mean to rain on your parade or anything, but realistically I (I'm sorry if I offend you) really don't think many people can be SEALS or army rangers or force recon. The people you see on TV aren't those guys, it's the grunts. The guys that walk around on foot and raid buildings. The guys who give children candy and get blown up. We are where the strength of the US military lies. In the grunts. If I where you I'd wanna be a USMC grunt cause there ain't no better job.|`|7jNYqtWOaa	I agree with John, you can't beat the Marines.  They get the most difficult and prestigious missions.  Army Rangers often have a more classified mission so you don't hear all the details in the media.  Same with Special Forces, or SF.    Don't just pay attention to the media.    My suggestion is that you decide what you want to do long-term.  Being infantry is great and you'll be guaranteed lots of deployments to places where they don't like Americans, but most people who do the rough missions end up requesting reclassification due to medical issues; infantry and Rangers and SF are hard on the body, even a man's body.    The one bad thing about the Marines is that they are infantry first.  It's tough to pursue an education as an enlisted man because you are always expected to be a Marine first.  In the army college is stressed more, but even here an enlisted man is not given as much time off to pursue an education as an officer is.  And don't even consider getting married as the Marines and Army are hard on marriages.    Living conditions for both army and Marines is about the same:  bases suck!  The Navy has better living conditions.  Promotions in the Army are the best, though.    I thank you in advance for serving our country.|`|UDak8Zm1aa	Not only are marines trained to be infantry first, us army folks go to basic training to learn how to be an infantry man. Me I am a 21B that is a combat engineer. We do alot of stuff that infantry does but we do it with explosives and a wide variety of different tasks. We could be raiding houses, defending a base camp, blowing up unexploded bombs and the list continues.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	The Navy Seals are like an exacto blade.  The Marines are like a sledgehammer.  If you want to be the hero go Army and tell them you want 11-B (infantry) or go Marines and tell them you want 0-300 (Infantry).      If you go Army you can apply for Special Forces.  If you wash out you'll still be Infantry.  If you go Seal and wash out, you'll be a sailor.  It should be noted, Marines can go to SEAL training.      The US Military is NOT a peacekeeping force.  They are trained to close with and kill the enemy whereever the politicians and voters say they are.|`|t58rc9tCaa	Son the only army you ought to join is the Salvation Army. Iraqis want the GIs out, Obama wants 'em out, America wants 'em out. Why risk your life just as the war is about to end?|`|w9iFqTgTaa	If you want to be the best and serve with the best, go Ranger. They have a multitude of missions as well as are used by many as an avenue to move into bigger and better things like the Green Berets for example. And you will have plenty of oppurtunity to go to those high speed schools such as, Airborne, Air Assault, Halo School, Pathfinder, ect..|`|dJdf92Xfaa	Each branch does combat, only on different levels.  Just depends how "Up close and personal" you want to be.    Marines - Overall as a Corps, very dedicated, loyal, trained well in combat in almost all career fields they have.  Infantry wise, they are the first in, can suffer many casualities, and are trained to attack an objective, secure it, and maintain it until support arrives, generally an Army forces to take over.    Army - Overall we all get combat training, not nearly as good as Marines get.  Infantry train all the time, day in day out.  Army today though relies more on tanks and helicopters to do the bulk of the fighting before our troops go in.   But there is only so much equipment can do, so then your troops are put at risk in foot patrols, checkpoints and other vital security measures.      Navy - Push the button, fire the missile and watch the impact on a screen.  Not much "in your face" combat.    Air Force - Similar to Navy but more involved with joint strikes with other services.  US rules most all air conflicts and from there, the bombers take over.    Now I didnt mention specialized forces in this because they are a special breed, and I dont mean that in a bad way.  Army and Marine recons are those guys that sneak in extremely hostile areas to put that laser on a target for the smart weapons.  Army Rangers, SF, Delta; highly trained in covert ops, very "up close and personal".  But they are trained to get in quietly, complete the mission, and get out without leaving traces.  Seals are the same.  Unless you know specifically that your interested in one of these specialized units, combat you can get just about anywhere.|`|otUmPr3waa	Become pararescue. They do search and rescue missions. So when our beloved Marines and Rangers are shot down and need some help we go in and get them out!!! This is a sweet job, but not for everyone.    Good luck|`|CLOtMCwSaa	First and foremost, in order to get to go and see that combat, you have to get thru your basic and ait, at least that is what we call it here in the army. Second of all to go and be like a ranger or a seal, you have to go thru specialized courses, which require survival training, to the extreme. Make sure that you look into it real good before you get into it. Might not be all that its cracked up to be. I have been to Afghanistan, and I know what you mean about combat, its a rush. I love it, I can't wait till I go back. Hope that helps.
Q7ovix19aa	Yep, but once you take power from someone else you try to stop the next group from taking yours.    The anti-Federalists created our Bill of Rights for protection against the Federalists who took control after the British were gone.  They realized the problem wasn't British, it was all humans.  Like every creature, humans instinctively take territory to control.  Some want all of it.    We have the right to sweep out our leaders when they become too much to bear.

The problem is the liberal priests and bishops who are responsible for protecting the Eucharist and shepherding the faithful...they need to take their faith and the Church seriously. <br>  <br>  I have never heard of a petition though...and I'm not sure how that would work. The Church is not a democracy that is influenced by petitions. The teachings on life, on mortal sin, and on not receiving the Eucharist, are all written and known to anyone who cares to pay attention. There is nothing to "change" with a petition. You'd have to be able to force the priests not to give them communion...and that would be tough.<br>  <br>  ADDED: As far as separation of Church and state, that does not apply in this situation. This is not the Church telling people how to vote or what to believe, only stating that if you claim to be a Catholic, you must abide by the Catholic Church teaching. If you do not, you are not Catholic. The Church has every right to tell "Catholics" how to be Catholic.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Church and state seperation in politics is what is followed---IN POLITICS.<br>  In Church, it does not need to be because then it would be the government imposing it's rule on the Church which would be doing exactly the opposite of seperation.

JuCUl0lJaa	Don't panic. The moron who lived in the house before you owes out money, and people are trying to trace them. The debt is tied to them, not the house. Just return the mail to sender, and if the bailiffs come around, all you have to do is show them I.D. with your name and address (like a driving license) that proves you now have legal rights to live in the house, and there is nothing that they can say, do or take from that property.
DFJ9m4WKaa	If you go to traffic court you can make your case to the Judge. Unless it is completely obvious you were in the wrong, you have a fair chance at fighting the case. If you had a wittiness on your behalf, that would double your chances of success.<br>  <br>  But you'll still have to pay the court fees, in some states. And the cost varies greatly. Basically if the cost of the court fee is greater than the ticket, the only reason to fight it is to keep it off your driving record. You also still risk having to pay for both court and the ticket if found guilty.<br>  <br>  With you're mostly clean driving record I'd say you have about a 50/50 chance, but I'm not a traffic law expert either.<br>  <br>  Ps it doesn't matter if the ticketing officer shows up or not. If the court room is provided by a written testimony against you, its just as good as if the officer was in the court room himself.|`|upIrlDm5aa	No you wont win the case, your only chance of winning the case is if the ticketing officer doe's not show up to the court case.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	i dont know ive never been pulled over by a cop|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	I really don't think it will work.  The only person that you could convince with your story about why you didn't perceive this to be an offense deserving a ticket was the cop.  You had your chance when he pulled you over.  In effect, whether he listened and didn't believe you or simply had already made up his mind that you should have been more aware of the surrounding situation, he thinks that you deserve the ticket.  When you get to court, unless you have some additional evidence that would explain why your view of the situation was different than the officer's, then the judge is most likely going to side with the officer.<br>  <br>  Even though you have received a ticket before, you may want to go to court and go through the process, especially if it is in a different jurisdiction than the first ticket.  They may still allow you to do a driving school or something like that, but do not lie about the first ticket as they may have your record anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|a37cc61e403f0d20764cd4a57c4b871baa	Any other state....50/50.

qCmhX7w0aa	I think if the govt. or govt employees starts doing its work properly, this problem can be solved.    1) All the govt employees (Police, Judges......) should declare their and their relatives assets before joining. Anything above their salary should be ceased by the govt.                                 or    The salary ( Cash) of the govt. employees should be slashed by 75%. Facilities should be doubled e. g. free schooling, lodging, food, medical,vehicle, .................. in a govt. institution, as per the post of the employee. Availing it should be mandatory. Thus the condition of govt. institution will improve.  2) The job security should not be there.  3) Commission ( like in sales)for completing a job by a govt. employee should be paid by the govt.. So that they keep on looking for doing a job.  4) The govt. employees, who have taken a job should be held responsible for not completing it resulting termination / suspension of job.  5) The biggest and the only problem is the judiciary system. Judges should be appointed in huge numbers. They should be paid commission by the govt. for giving a decision or completing a case. Putting pressure on lawyers to complete the case in max 4-5 hearings. Time ( max 2-3 mnths) between the hearings should be decided by the parties. if the case is against a govt. employee he should be remain suspended.   6) The name of the petitioner and the respondent should be hidden. So that the judges may not feel the pressure in giving a decision.|`|f5ac3c161d787224f6fa6334a5675d50aa	we are human being,we have to protect our life.No judge will take that decision , and live peacefully after that.

a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	There are many laws on the books already. Gun control only affects those of us who abide by the laws anyway.   More gun control does not keep guns out of the hands of criminals but instead creates more of a criminal market for guns.   Most of the new ideas they are proposing would have very little effect on reducing gun violence anyway... the ideas are out there to appease the gun lobbyist groups.|`|TbMXb5YFaa	I'm a correctional officer and I can tell you this.... Criminals who are killers will kill with whatever means they have available. More gun laws just punishes law abiding citizens and career criminals are not law abiding.|`|AA10933085	NO, the only peaple that will abide by the laws are the ones that will not use a weapon in the wrong way.  The 'bad guys' will use weapons no matter what the laws state.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	if you place laws banning or restricting guns what makes you think criminals would abide by them? youd only be taking it out of the hands of law abiding citizens NOT murderers.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	We should require all law abiding citizens to own a gun for their own protection.|`|dVQdswtTaa	No, the areas with the strongest gun control laws have the highest level of gun violence. If there had been a single armed person during any of the most infamous gun massacres, they would have been able to end it quickly, instead, all anyone could do is run or beg for their lives.     Look at it this way, murder is illegal, the highest penalties are reserved for those who take life. If centuries of laws against murder don't stop killing, why would a gun law stop it? By definition, a person who murders another person is a criminal and therefore disregards laws. The idea that you could pass a law and stop them is laughable.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	No, if we do that then only the criminals will have guns. I say no gun control whatever, class 3 included.|`|8MUj24s6aa	No.    This says it all.    I got this from another answerer on Y!A  This is a post from an Australian police officer...    Hi Yanks, I thought you all would like to see the now available data  from Down Under. It has now been one year (12 months) since gun   owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal  firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing  Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.     The first year results are now available:  -Australia-wide, homicides are up 6.2 percent;  -Australia-wide, assaults are up 9.6 percent;  -Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent);      In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up      300 percent as compared with the last one year period when private      ownership of a firearm was legal.     (NB: the law-abiding citizens did turn in their personal firearms,      the criminal element did not and thus criminals in Australia still      possess their guns.)   -While data for the 25 years preceding the confiscation of privately  owned guns showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms,    this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months as criminals   now are assured their victims will be unarmed.   -There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults   of the elderly, while the resident is at home. Australian politicians are   at a loss to explain how public safety has  decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in  successfully ridding Australian society of guns.'   -This story of well intentioned government intervention in the   rights of lawful individuals to own and possess firearms won't be seen in the  mainstream US media or on the American evening news. Senator Obama   who advocates a similar confiscation in the US will not be reporting   any of this to you. But, the Australian experience speaks for itself. Guns in the   hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws  affect only the law-abiding citizens.    Americans may want to take note before it's too late!  http://www.gunowners.org/hlr-au.htm       "The laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."  Thomas Jefferson    http://www.youtube.com/user/DOUGandFRIEN...|`|kQSSz2X2aa	NO!!!  Stricter gun control laws result in higher crime rates. Criminals don't obey the laws, but law abiding citizens do. It would leave the innocent defenseless.|`|UDak8Zm1aa	No cause how are we going to make new laws when we can't enforce the ones we have on guns.|`|NZuJR79oaa	No. we should have no gun control.  The reason we have the second amendment is to if necessary replace a hostile government, as our founders did.  When only cops have guns its a police state.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Yes!  I work on my gun control every week at the range.  I can hit center mass at 25m one handed with my Glock 22 97% with 50 rounds.      I encourage everyone to improve their gun control.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	how about just bullet control instead?|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	Aside from the fact that the 2nd Amendment exists, let's look at this:    There are currently more than 25,000 "gun control" laws on the books throughout the United States, yet guns continue to be used in violent crime.  Why pass more laws when the ones already in place have proven not to work?    Drugs are illegal, yet America still has a drug problem.  Obviously, simply outlawing something isn't the solution.    And for the granddaddy of all "NO" answers, which is something that I still don't understand why all the anti-gunners don't get:      GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION WILL  ONLY BE OBEYED BY LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.  THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IN OUR SOCIETY WILL CONTINUE TO IGNORE IT.      ANY "gun control" law - no matter what it is - will ONLY be effective if the citizens obey it.  I kinda think that the criminals who use guns in the commission of crimes are gonna pretty much ignore gun control laws, don't you?  Besides, it's not the law-abiding citizens you have to worry about - it's the criminal element.    This is a simple fact of life that I just don't understand why people don't get.|`|3caq6SFxaa	For what reason would we need them?  Law abiding citizens use the current system and have background checks done on them and they would follow new controls but the simple fact is criminals don't and wouldn't.  The system proposed in the House of licensing fees, initially set at $25 per weapon, does not include any safeguards to what the fee will be in the future-the licensing is for five years but the fee is annual and in the future would be set by the Attorney General with AG Holder already stating more then once he does not believe the Second Amendment applies to civilians and in his opinion the Supreme Court did not say it did in the Holder ruling.  He could simply keep raising the fees until people could not pay them and then the previous law biding citizens either become felons by breaking the law or give up that Constitutional right.  The government did not take away your right to own firearms just taxed it out of the reach of most citizens.  The current system is good though I do think some things need to be strengthened or changed-the inability to check mental health records was done by liberals as an invasion of privacy and misuse of medical records but I think those should be reviewed but not by a government assigned person as again the politics would allow them to disqualify everyone for "bad thoughts".  Interesting that it was attempted last year to add PTSD as a disqualifying mental illness, lifetime ban, and at the same time the doctor backing it said all combat and most military personnel suffer from it to one degree or another so that would mean a soldier can carry and M16 in combat but could never own a single shot 22 personally.  The current system is pretty good and it is not fool proof but no system ever is fool proof.  I would add that most countries that have started national registration in the recent past have quickly moved to confiscation of first one type of firearm and then another until the individual has none.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	The current gun control laws should be adequate, if only the criminals would obey them.    Federal law restricts purchase age to 18 for rifles and shotguns, and 21 for handguns. Background checks are required to keep felons, and the mentally ill from buying guns. Many states have even stricter laws.    I don't know what laws would make the slightest difference. I have owned and used guns my entire life, and so have all my friends, and not once has anyone been hurt by them.     Guns are not the problem, and gun control is not the solution.|`|nooi0ldjaa	if you outlaw firearms then only outlaws have them.  and by taking away my chance to defend my self you make their job way easier...and when a job is easy more people want it!|`|5wej1TKDaa	No, that would only lead to what they're trying to prevent...more crime.

9tcv3TiWaa	Has he gone to the Navy College office and talked to the counselors there? Sometimes they will have the best information for him and that can include which college is the one to go to that will give the most credits.  It sounds like they are not really looking at the education he has received already.    yes colleges can give and should give credit.  When my spouse went to start up he got over 30 credits for all the training he had received.|`|AA11593134	I am in the Air Force and might be different for Navy... But go to his base (or post?) education center and ask the advisor. I got a lot of credits from basic training, our technical training (I don't know what it is called in the Navy)... But yes, expecially if he's already got Medical courses and experience, I'm sure you should get credit for them.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	He may be better off looking elsewhere.  Has he taken his certificates of completion to them showing what he has done??  Also, have him speak with the folks at the education offfice on the base.  They may have some more guidance for him.  And, who knows... the person he spoke with may be clueless.  They may have someone who specialized in dealing with military transcripts. (I know the university hubby goes to... every time he does another AF course, he has to send off the paperwork to one particular counselor, she does nothing but deal with the military)  And he's wiped out quite a bit using his military training... whether job or leadership related.        Good luck and keep at it!|`|VdaQ2Vo0aa	It depends.  Most of the credits I received were for electives.  I did receive some for English but that was it.  I had to take most of the general classes.    Plus, just because you have classes does not mean they will fit into every degree program.  For example, anatomy might not fit into a Business or Criminal Justice degree.    Shop around for a college that will give you the most credit for what your husband has. If he wants a BA or BS and the college gives him enough credit to complete his electives that is nothing to complain about.     Sounds like you need to do more research and really figure out how college works and how classes work in a degree program.|`|AA11163314	I have dealt with this situation myself.  Most colleges will grant credits for general education requirements but not for the 'core' classes relating to your major.    The way it was explained to me was that they will only allow credit if that class exactly duplicated theirs.|`|IPDCi1Wtaa	Have him try the following site:    https://smart.navy.mil/smart/welcome.do    He can print out his transcripts and see what he is eligible for.  He will be eligible for things as small as a gym or health credit all the way up to the more advanced courses.  I am an AD (aircraft mech), and I have been able to get credit for MOST of my training, and things I didn't think were important.    He can look at the site, and also have official transcripts mailed to the school.  If they do not accept any of his military experience, then he needs to find another school that does.  There is no reason to pay for school and classes that have already been taken!  Contact Navy College or either he can go there himself on base, and speak with someone from personnel.    GOOD LUCK!!|`|Ln5XNno3aa	It depends on the School he goes through, I go through Central Texas College, and once I took 2 classes, the looked at my military training,and gave me college credit for the things I had already done.

You have no rights to anything unless he gives you a POA; and that still may not give you any right to act on the property.    You need to take everything, including your grandfather, to a lawyer.

T2zD3FS6aa	Depends on where you live. I don't think you can in any of the United States without your parents permission at your age, and only in a few with permission. But seriously, what's your hurry? Wait a few years or so. You have your entire life ahead of you and marriage is supposed to be forever. Even with no-fault divorce a bad marriage usually means a few years of misery. Wait to get some better perspective on who he is and on who you are.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	You know what...bless your heart.  I'll tell you what dear, if he'll marry you then yes you can.|`|AA11206283	With your parents permission in some states yes.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Yes you can but since you are under 18 you have to have you parents consent. They will have to sign papers for you saying you are aloud to be married. The only thing is, you wont be aloud to be married to him, since you are not even at the age of consent yet and  he is legal. he would get in big trouble for being with you.|`|AA10295984	Yes you can, but only if your parents consent to the marriage. Honestly, I got married young and it was the dumbest thing I ever did. Fortunately, the marriage ended in less than 3 years and I moved on with my life.|`|ZivgciCLaa	dang honey that is way to yound wait till your 20 just wait your life will getscrewed up like my sisters she got married at 15 and boom bad things happened she just wasnt ready to handle a family.|`|KasFZL7laa	depending on what state you are in, and its own laws, you should be able to with the consent of your parents.    i don't know why you would want to though.|`|2esGKO2Caa	nope and i hope he's not having sex with you right now because if he is; he will be in trouble if someone wants to prosecute him.

And you cant have sex either or he will get arrested and labeled a sex offender.|`|oNb8RqTEaa	Do not do it. If you love each other that much you can wait until you are 18. It varies from state to state and depends on your parents too.|`|iT31pFLqaa	maybe in tennesee, but i doubt it....|`|MW5EJxKNaa	At fifteen, you can get married, but you need parental consent.

Would you approve someone who travels or someone who stuck to one place? Traveling makes sure that the person will be denied or make sure that it will take years.    Three times? It is not going happen.|`|AA10887916	Very unlikely, as this is unlikely to remove the reason for refusal of the US visa.|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	Traveling to other countries has nothing to do with getting a US visa.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	No, the US will not compromise visa requirement standards due to the lesser requirements of other nations. Her only option is to eliminate the disqualifying factors and after 3 denials, that could be quite difficult.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	sorry but she will likely  be denied again.
3WYcPsm4aa	Active duty can apply for lasik eye surgery.  There are conditions, however.    You have to go through the optometry clinic, and be approved by them as a good candidate.  You have to get on the wait list for the approved military hospitals.  (There are only a handful that do the surgery)  You must pay your own way there and back again.  Depending upon the branch, you may have to use your own leave.  Some will allow a permissive TDY, others will not.    ETA: Wait lists vary from hospital to hospital.  We were told  the same thing... that it's best to do it while we are over here, as Landstuhl doesn't have much of a wait list.  Stateside there can be quite long lists.|`|IPDCi1Wtaa	You can get it, however, there is a LONG waiting list.  I have a cousin that put in for it, and her wait was 3 years..that time still hasn't come up yet.    Hopefully, you are not going to join the military in hopes of free corrective surgery.|`|VXfB4If3aa	I don't know about the Navy but I'm in the Army and stationed in Germany and we've had three people now in over a month get laser eye surgery done and they weren't on a waiting list either.    BUT:    after you get it done you're on a profile for like a year....you can't swim for a year. you have to wear sunglasses for a while after the surgery, you can't do field training and other things on the job...    You're allowed one free surgery in the Army.  Not sure if it's for the military overall but I know you're allowed one surgery in the Army.  So if i were you ~ i would research it and/or go talk to a recruiter and make them look into it.|`|LwPcGpAOaa	Once in the navy you could get the lasic eye procedure.  You would have to be in the military and complete all your training for another job before you could get this done.  Then you could apply to be a seal.
ABmZYbDZaa	The user name is your SS and the pin is a four digit number. If you don't know it then you are going to have to reset it.     I'm going to assume since you only use it for taxes that you either are no longer in and are just waiting for your last W2 or that you're retired. Either way loosing your pin number is a very bad idea.

That is welfare.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	how is this? the people from the CBO, obamas people, said we would be better off in the long run if we just do nothing. this bill creates over 150 new agencies, this money that funds them will run out and then those jobs will have to be funded or cut.how do fund those jobs then, raise taxes. this bill grows the gov substantially. we have had worse economic times and did not need this kind of money. more than half of this money will not be spent until after 2011, how does that help us and the CBO says this bill will cause inflation that cannot be avoided. best idea, let it correct itself. do not reward bad behavior by punishing the ones that followed the rules and giving money to those that caused the problem.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Round up the illegal aliens and send them home at their own expense.<br>  <br>  Use the death penalty and save money keeping these prisoners alive for decades.<br>  <br>  Take ships out of mothballs and use them to house prisoners in the ocean somewhere...no need for guards or other prison personnel.

S1Q1mVgJaa	Im not sure about FL, but in TN the state would have a case. They have physical evidence and an eye witness testimony (I assume the victim was a witness). However if the owner of the property and victim/parent or guardian don't press charges then the defendant is most likely  looking at a disturbing the peace charge. But I don't know all the facts. <br>  <br>  p.s.

Bush made Nixon look like a Choir Boy. Get over your sound bites Con.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Straw man question.  You start with a wrong premise, a condition that does not exist.  Name a single tax increase Obama has signed into law.  The stimulus bill decreased taxes both for individuals and for small businesses.  <br>  <br>  Why are you so ignorant and happy to stay that way?  Yeah, it's criminal to pass a bill that attempts to repair the infrastructure, lowers personal income taxes, and protects jobs by funding failing states.<br>  <br>  Edit: Navy505, since the only money being given to persons directly is in the form of a tax cut, how will those 44% get ahold of theirs?  The average American will be given an additional $13 a check in their takehome pay.  It is true that there are working people who pay no income tax.  Should they then be forbidden to get that same $13?|`|u23sBafTaa	They haven't seen the light yet, this Pork laden package could very well be the thing that puts us under !  Why they can't see that the Democrats are playing them for fools and stealing there money.  I know there are a lot of hard working democrats the same as republicans, I just don't get why they don't see that this is just rampant spending and we are the ones who are going to pay for years for it !  I understand the welfare people loving it it caters to them,but all of the rest of us are going to very little good things from this !<br>  <br>  Everyone who said that they are getting tax cuts, is that your $13 dollar a week, read the package , wait in the next 12 to 18 months we will be hit with what they call the maxium tax program , it was covered this year, but, they can raise it anytime they want to and it is about $2300.00 a family a year !|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Obama hasn't raised taxes, and if he does I've got news for you: running a government, stimulis packages, bank bailouts, and foreign wars cost money. I suspect you cheered these various programs when President Bush implemented them. Now you are going to whine when the bill comes due. For 6 years the Republicans controlled the House, the senate, and the administrative. They showed no fiscal restraint. <br>  <br>  POT, MEET KETTLE.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	He hasn't raised taxes at all so I'm assuming you are listening to Rush Limbaugh, where facts mean nothing.<br>  But how we are going to pay for all this crap is a good question.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	How am I being taxed to death?  Please elaborate and also let me know how the stimulus bill is criminal.  What elite special interest groups are running this thing?  Yes, there is pork.  That's the way it works.  There are also good things in there.  I personally would like to update our infrastructure so I can drive across a bridge in Minnesota and not have it collapse.  I'd also love to see them update the air traffic control system that has been in use since the 50's.|`|peeNituyaa	What is criminal is your stupidity!  The man won fair and square.  How about giving him an opportunity and see how it turns out.  Right now, he is doing no better or worse than anyone else would, give it time.

That's time you can't get back!|`|iZDsMCghaa	Wow, I agree wholeheartedly!<br>  Not much is more upsetting than dishing out so much just to be slapped in the face when I need a little boost.

The remainder of the people who voted for Obama think he is going to make them a part of the 44% as far as not paying taxes but getting "Stimulus".  The ones who didn't vote for Obama know he is going to make them a part of the 44%, but not because their income went up.<br>  <br>  The great lie of Socialism is that is elevates the poor.  However, Socialism doesn't make everyone equally rich...it makes them equally miserable.  In addition...Socialism's logical end is Communism because Socialism relies on voluntarily allowing yourself to have the same as everyone else...but it's Communism that has to force the people to go against human nature.<br>  <br>  "Greed is good"<br>  Gordon Gecko|`|a8r4Lodaaa	I would suggest a little more education regarding policy, economics,  banking and financing.

The Republican party I will admit needs to be turned around.  It was time for a change. I support Obama 100%, and I will do what is asked of me by my President to help place our country back on track.   <br>  <br>  As Kennedy said himself....ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU, BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY!<br>  <br>  That is a profound statement, and Americans need to come together and support the President.  Because after all, if it works out to our better interest, will anyone still complain?  Is anyone who does not support Obama going to NOT accept a stimulus check?  I doubt it.<br>  <br>  Regarding the economy, to fix the problem we are in will take money, time and patience.  It will definitely take everyone to help the economy along.  No matter how much we think not spending is going to turn this thing around, it does not help. <br>  <br>  And besides every American represents a special interest group...YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL IS A SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP!|`|AA10126668	I guess the same reason republicans supported a man who was actually 'KILLING" us to death by sending us to fight in illegal wars.|`|McfrauFnaa	yes. it is. but democrats just wanted bush gone incidentaly i still think obama is the antichrist but thats a whole other topic|`|535812a50f219760f8422e72a97882abaa	same old government same old  government<br>   obama is just bush squared|`|K71Qoakwaa	"Taxing us to death"?

I've included a link to the law.  Also a link to an attorney, you should have one present.  I would suggest that you turn yourself in where you live to see if Florida will even extradite you, it will depend upon their case load, the evidence against you and how far away you are.|`|Qiq1Ht0Saa	It all depends on the evidence and if this is your first offense.  Do you have any priors?  By turning yourself in, you will be considered cooperating with the authorities and they will be favorable to giving you minimum time base on your past priors.|`|AA11599407	That would depend on if it is a misdemeanor or a felony, misdemeanors usually get jail time but felony charges get you in prison.

You are to take all statements and turn them in your favor before the jury so that you can convince them that you are correct and the other party is incorrect.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step 1: Summarize your major arguments by highlighting what each witness helped you prove. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Step 2: Summarize the Law and how it helps you prove your side.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Step 3: Summarize the Case Law and how it helps you prove your side. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Step 4: Reiterate how the Jury will be serving Justice by siding with you.<br>  <br>   <br>  For examples:<br>  <br>   For Attempted Murder CASE (United States v. Martha Monroe):<br>  <br>  Practice writing a closing statement for the defense by filling in the blanks. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, Martha Monroe suffered from Battered Woman Syndrome, and is NOT guilty of First Degree Murder, only guilty of defending herself from her brutal husband.

From voir dire through closing argument, his contention was that he was a killer and if he had intended to kill Ms. Foster, she would be dead. For example, appellant's counsel concluded his opening statement with the following words:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  And ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I submit to you that John Michael Sides, Jr. has killed before. He knows how to kill. And if he intended to kill any of those people, they wouldn't be here testifying today and we'd be here at a whole different sort of trial.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  [?19] This approach to the case continued in appellant's closing argument. The gist of the argument was that the State had failed to prove premeditation. Further, a considerable portion of the argument consisted of suggestions of what appellant, an experienced killer, would have done differently had he really intended to kill Ms. Foster. In rebuttal closing, the prosecutor referred to the above statements, and then said, "[t]hat is a line that the inmates tell each other when they're unsuccessful in attempts to murder somebody." Appellant objected to this comment as not being based on the evidence, but was overruled.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  [?20] Appellant's objection is summed up in the following quote from his appellate brief:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The prosecutor's comment was an unsupported claim that the jury could assume that the Appellant, as a prisoner, automatically had the intent to kill Ms. Foster. The comment was particularly prejudicial in light of the Appellant's theory of defense, his lack of premeditated intent to kill Ms. Foster.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  [?21] The purpose of closing argument is to allow counsel to offer ways of viewing the significance of the evidence. Ross v. State, 930 P.2d 965, 971 (Wyo. 1996) (quoting Browder v. State, 639 P.2d 889, 893 (Wyo. 1982)). Claims of prosecutorial misconduct based on a statement made during closing argument are measured first by viewing the statement in the context of the entire argument and second by reference to the entire record, "and hinge on whether a defendant's case has been so prejudiced as to constitute denial of a fair trial." Arevalo v. State, 939 P.2d 228, 230 (Wyo. 1997). Counsel are to be afforded wide latitude in the scope of closing argument. Vigil v. State, 926 P.2d 351, 359 (Wyo. 1996). On appeal, the district court's ruling as to the scope of permissible argument will not be reversed unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion, and then only if a reasonable probability exists that, absent the error, the verdict would have been different. Arevalo, 939 P.2d at 230.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [?22] Here, the prosecutor's comment in rebuttal closing was nothing more than an innocuous response to appellant's defense. Boiled down to bare essentials, appellant's counsel said, "He could have killed her if he had wanted to," and the prosecutor replied, "that's what they all say." When placed in the context of both closing arguments, and when viewed in light of the record as a whole, it simply cannot be said that this exchange had any effect upon the verdict. This was not a close case; the record fully supported the result. For example, while motive is not an element of attempted first-degree murder, the existence of motive may be probative. Grabill v. State, 621 P.2d 802, 808 (Wyo. 1980). In the present case, the jury could infer motive from appellant's prior problems with Ms. Foster, and his vocal complaints about her earlier during the day of the incident. In addition, appellant took a weapon with him to confront Ms. Foster. He threatened to kill Ms. Foster. He attacked Ms. Foster with the weapon, stabbing her twice. He cut her rescuer. Then he practically bragged to the jury that he was an accomplished killer. There is no prejudice here.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You are the defense in this case log correct? I hope so.|`|AA12205273	A closing statement is a summation of your argument, plus you want to hit them hard a statement that leaves the audience thinking about your case.<br>  Forgive me for saying so, but it's a little sophomoric to try father Abraham.

The only problem is we don't want her to become the next Hillary.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Why don't you just stop watching shows with people who are out to put others down & start being a decent person. No, she is not fair game for criticism. She has no intention of costing people their lives. That is the only reason anyone should be critical. Dems put up with Bush knowing he was a failure at everything he ever did & his father started a war to take his crooked brother's S & L robbery out of the news. Bush robbed our country of trillions but he did it by borrowing so that now we need to borrow just to stay a float, which me might not be able to do. Michelle Obama is a lovely person & I don't know where you hear she is helping to make policy but I would question your info. if you have a troll like this. Watch mature people on the news once in while or all the time if you want to stop being so aggravated. You are putting out all this false negative energy & then wondering why your life sucks so much. You have be the person you want to have in life. If you can take someone as classy as Michelle Obama & see want to put her down you are not seeing clearly at all. You can put down anyone you want but remember that as you do this for no reason other than to build yourself up you are actually putting yourself down more.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Of course she is fair game for criticism, but why bother?  She's not the President.  If Obama ends up being impeached for trying to subvert the Constitution (which he has already started to try to do) or "asked" to resign for the same reason, what his wife says won't matter.|`|D5tIByciaa	criticize all you want, that's what we do|`|pgdTmT6caa	I just want them gone period.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	She may help make policy but he still calls the shots.

I'm talking about enouogh shares that they got to sit on boards of directors.  In the early 1980's (I forget which year), there was a report that their income was such that they had to pay 110 percent income tax!  Yes, that's 11 SKr in taxes for every 10 SKr they made.

It simply means that many more services are funded through tax dollars -- health care, education, etc.  The government doesn't run businesses any more than in the US (um, with the exception of health care insurance, i guess).  And the term socialism doesn't have any meaning in terms of personal freedoms, except taxation.|`|lvyEnAtAaa	By the standards of every nation but ours Western Europe is composed of capitalist democracies.  They all have social networks based on collective action that are designed to moderate the effects of their market system.    In the politically ignorant and indoctrinated USA we are taught to ignore such nuances and call everything collective socialism, so by our narrow standards they are all reds.
HZ9YfIMOaa	The Israeli election is a response to rocket attacks. Right-wingers will not surrender their land for nothing. Similarly, right wingers are more likely to respond to rocket attacks than left-wingers. After Israel was bombarded by rocket attacks for months and their government waited so long without doing anything, people became desperate. The worst case scenario is a decreased friendship between Obama's liberal adminitration and Israel, but I think the friendship between Israel and United States will remain strong.|`|jEYZkIrhaa	Actually they're pretty left-winged when compared to American politics.|`|IqUbpid6aa	Not even the worst case: The US will be pushed to war again for the radical Zionists..|`|bTguVXMjaa	Let's see: right-wingers in the United States defend our support of Israel by claiming that "it's the only democracy in that part of the world." So the Israeli voters elect a liberal female, and the powers that be push her aside and put Benjamin Netanyahu, another right-winger, in her place. I'd call it a right-wing coup.

The kids to day need to be taught some respect .|`|aCdya2qkaa	I think its good imagine somebody driving, especially women drivers they can only drive straight, then out comes a snow ball hits the windscreen, very dangerous. Well done police, arrest these kids. They might even have hidden knives in these snow balls.|`|9abmY3GZaa	pc (politically correct) puppets|`|YeXcm7Sqaa	The person/s who wrote that law must of had a snowball thrown at them when they were at school years and years ago and now they suffer a psycological extreme fear of snow and thought that if they had ever got into power somehow they would put a stop to that..... Come on ... how effing ridiculous ???? Imagine your kids having a criminal offence for that ...|`|gTMpu7V7aa	As long as the kids are just throwing snowballs at each other - fine. If they're chucking them at moving vehicles or at elderly people, women with small kids or disabled people - not fine.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Good thing too.  Knowing kids these days the snowballs probably had rocks hidden in them.  As usual of course the police have to waste their time on this, when it should have been the parents keeping an eye on the kids.|`|XR03jIndaa	Did you read it at all or just look at the headline and make assumptions? It says they are cracking down on kids throwing snowballs at CARS and DAMAGING them.   You think just cause they are having fun who cares what they destroy? If it were YOUR car wouldn't you want who did it punished?   And what of the ones throwing them at MOVING cars? thats ILLEGAL, so just cause they are kids having fun who cares if they cause an accident that hurts or kills someone. they are just kids, right?    Perhaps you should read all of what your talking about, and think before you say something stupid.|`|AA10925759	Sure it is all about throwing snowballs at cars. Not a bunch of kids just throwing snowballs in a field.     I have lived in a bunch of places such as the US, UK, Germany and Sweden where they arrest you for throwing snowballs at cars.     The driver could be startled or it could take their attention away from driving if only for a split second. There can be an accident meaning property damage, insurance and all of that.    Near where I live now (US) a few years ago some kids were winging snowballs across the street from each other. One hit a car, the diver swerved (snow equals wet road). The driver hit one of the kids and the kid was crippled. But the driver herself slammed into a tree and later died. And this was a low speed thing.     On a lower level one snowball can make quite a ding on a car. With fixing that and a total paint job (so the paint matches all), rental car, time off of work to deal with it and and such it adds up to quite a sum. Lets see what a parent has to say when they get that bill.     Again all kids have to do is be smart about it. The police are not going to arrest those who are just throwing snowballs at each other away from traffic.|`|8piMa0ARaa	It's a joke!, what is the world coming to when you get arrested for a snowball fight?.

Perhaps they should arrest the parents for not raising their children to be better behaved.    If some little monster damages my car with a snowball, the police arresting him would be the least of his worries.|`|hwuguK98aa	As many other people have said on here, there is nothing wrong with kids snowballing each other, I did when I was a kid! But, as many others have said , it's not right say for them to be throwing snowballs at innocent people eg as Rikster said, an elderly man. What has he done?! Dont forget that a stone could quite easily be picked up in the snow and cause an injury. I think in these instances, their parents should ground them if they do it to people other than each other. The police should only be involved if they are throwing snowballs at cars, as I know only too well (especially as an advanced learner driver), how frightening it is as a driver and you are targeted.    I actually had to get the police the other day; I was on the train coming back from the weekend having seen my partner, and all these football hooligans got on (not all were, but I would say half were drunk and disorderly). They were intimidating other passengers, including myself, and urinating on the floor in the loo. When I went to use the toilet, they were so intoxicated they forgot to lock the door, and started shrieking and being abusive towards me, and making crude comments. I felt so vulnerable and scared I got the guard, who took it seriously and called the police, especially when one of the lads had made a disgusting gesture about his penis to me. One of the policemen was so kind, the other saw me as a timewaster, and insinuated it was MY fault for "accidently" opening the door when they were on the toilet! Pathetic.     I reckon though that the police should only arrest young people when they pose a danger to car drivers or people such as the man Rikster mentioned. Other than that, they should leave the poor guys alone, and be on the lookout/take anti-social behaviour such as I have mentioned more seriously.|`|AA11327323	Snowballs? That sounds like a innocent little game, who could that hurt?                     What is a snowball? You scoop up a handful of nice soft snow and shape it like a base ball.

But Boy George blew it.|`|DBIKou8faa	Bill Clinton is an egomaniac.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Clinton and all democrats forget they are to blame in this recession. Clinton had become very unpopular by 1994. Breaking his pledge to cut taxes and failing on health care reform convinced Americans to vote Republican in the 1994 mid-term elections. Congressional Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich of Georgia created the contract with American, which proposed changes in lower taxes, welfare reform, tougher anti-crime laws, term limits for Congress, and a Balanced Budget amendment. Republicans won a stunning victory, gaining 54 seats in the House of Representatives and 8 seats in the United States Senate, for the first time in 40 years, they had the majority in both houses of Congress. In their first 100 days the House passed the Contract with America, however, the Senate and many of the President's vetoes defeated many of the proposals, including a balanced budget amendment. <br>   <br>  In 1995 President Clinton and Congressional Republicans fought a bitter battle over the new federal budget. Clinton vetoed Republican budget proposal, claiming they cut social programs. Speaker Gingrich believed that Clinton would back down and approve the budget. If not the entire government would shut down because of lack of funds. Clinton allowed just that, and by doing so gained political capital by successfully blaming that shut down on Republicans. Soon afterword, Clinton and the Congress reached an agreement to a balanced budget. <br>  Please Clinton may have been able to do better than Obama but it's a little to late. Where was bipartisan back then!|`|AA11828439	He NEVER said the Reps should "Bow down to Obama"! That is just a LIE!<br>  He was more fiscally conservative than the BUSH administration.

As your grandfather is still in charge of his faculties, and does no appear to have any terminal illness - no one can "put him down".      We do need right to die laws in our country.  I want the option of being able to say - "I have reached the end of my life and I wish to end my suffering."  Life is about quality - not quantity.  I would rather have six good months left and go out of my own accord, then have 6 years of suffering.

Targeting low-income neighborhoods for mortgages was unethical but not against the law.  But the main issue is whether we should continue to give more chances to repay.

You don't become a successful bank by making bad loans, and before you make a loan, you're supposed to assess the risk of default.

6OLiuM9Gaa	The initial reason was Hussein's inhuman treatment of his people... kind of like Hitler did to the Jews, and his repeated violation of the conditions under which we withdrew from Desert Storm.    The incentive was the constant harangue from Congress, the people of the US, and from the rest of the world for not getting the job done right the first time.    The impetus was 9/11. The people of the US were, for one brief, shining instant, united as a nation.    So, Operation Iraqi Freedom was undertaken. Congress voted to put troops on the ground in Iraq.    Ok, Hussein's captured, given to his people who tried him under Islamic Law, convicted, sentenced, and executed him. Time to come home,right?    Absolutely -- if one doesn't understand war, politics, or people.    In war, goals change on the battlefield. In politics not everything is what it seems. And some people are greedy.    On the battlefield the goal was "Iraqi Freedom." That would mean a government in which the people had a say.  With Hussein gone, a lot of little Hussein wannabes scurried out of the woodwork like the cockroaches they are seeking to pick up where Hussein left off. They have no interest in the Iraqi people or their freedom. They're driven by their greed for power and wealth (just as was Hussein). So we had to stay and keep the dogs at bay while the people had an election. Election over -- time to come home... right?    Absolutely -- if you don't understand war, politics, or people.    On the battlefield, goals change constantly. The objective is, as you might recall, Iraqi freedom. But, having a government, and never having had one before, these people really didn't know how to go about setting up a stable government. The maniacs (Hussein wannabes) were livid. They couldn't even get elected to Minister of Porcine Feces Removal. The undertook to sew hate and discontent by terror. Knowing they hadn't a prayer of getting Muslim support for their overthrow of the Muslim government of Iraq, they undertook to blame the US for all their troubles. They said, "Sure we capture, torture, and kill civilians. But it's the fault of the US for being here." And the ignorant believed them. Their real motive was purely political. They need to sew the seeds of fear. When they take over (as they hope to do one day -- when we leave), they need the people to tremble at the mention of their name. That's the way they want to rule Iraq. It's called terror. That's why they're called terrorists.    Why don't the Iraqi people take care of themselves? Great idea. But how? Nobody's ever had any freedom. Nobody knows anything about defending it. So, while we hold the dogs at bay and help them form a stable government, we undertake to train their military and police.    How long will that take? We can train a guy off the street in a couple of months. Well, sort of. We have a guy (or gal) 24/7 for a couple months. At the end of that time, the recruit is trained to be less of a threat to those along side whom he or she fights and more of a threat to the enemy. Then the recruit is sent to a some other training in some specialty necessary for the modern modes of combat. At the end of those additional two or three months, the recruit is turned over to seasoned veteran leaders who will pound into him or her the best way to do stuff so that when the stuff hits the fan, he or she will do it that way.     The problem in Iraq is that we don't have their "recruits" 24/7. Therefore it takes us five times as long to train them. Furthermore, they have no seasoned veteran leaders. It takes decades to accumulate those. Why? It's a culture thing. You really don't want us to go in and impose our culture on them... do you?    Decades? We'll be there for decades? I don't know... but I hope not. These people are unlearned, but they're not stupid. The war in which they find themselves certainly must increase their motivation to learn how to fight. And they are taking over more of the responsibility. Time to come home yet?    Not quite. We have some of the best trained soldiers in the world over there trying to train them. When those soldiers are convinced that the Iraqi military and police forces are ready to go, then we can start pulling out. For a few years after that, I think it would be prudent to keep a few thousand troops in the area just in case the new military got in a little over its head. But if we pull out too early, there's a good chance that the terrorists will still be able to take over. If that happens there are three very bad results. Eventually we'll have to go back to finish the job we didn't complete the first (or second) time. And that time we'll have to fight people we trained... or trained by people we trained. And finally, they'll believe they beat us once and they'll be convinced they can do it again... and they'll be right. They'll be wrong about the military, but their assessment of the American people will be right on. The American people, when they say, "When the going gets tough, the tough get going," they mean, "When the going gets tough, the tough leave."    One of the troops over there with whom I chatted said it this way. "My orders didn't say 'get the guy who wanted to hurt my daddy.' They didn't say 'find WMD." They didn't say 'get cheap oil.' They said 'Operation Iraqi Freedom.' That's why I'm here."    If anything, all the intermediate goals are like finding the five dollar bills. And, it we achieve the goal of Iraqi Freedom, we'll have some pretty incredible results. Our military will have finally been allowed to finish a job unlike in Korea, Vietnam, and Desert Storm. And, hopefully, we'll have a stable Muslim government we can support in the same way that we support Israel. And, hopefully, they'll be friendly towards us... as is Israel... most of the time.

For years Rush spoke out like crazy against drugs, often stating how anyone buying and selling should be locked up for life...  Clearly he simply falls in the same catagory of many other Americans.      This isn't a critic of him as a person.  Psychologically speaking its just often easier attack an external problem publicly then deal with ones own personal problems internally.
t3QAaSN9aa	Your numbers are off but regardless, in liberal states, Obama won the majority of the white vote.  In southern states, naturally, the percentages of the white vote for Obama are quite low, thereby skewing the numbers.     Almost all African Americans would have voted for the Democratic candidate, anyway, especially after Bush, so that statistic  means nothing.     So the answer is No, and you have absolutely no basis for this deliberately provocative question.  If race relations in this country are to improve you certainly won't be helping.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No.  45 percent of whites voted for the President, not 40.|`|c848061b89b79ec53411715c54766887aa	Oh brother.

How many Black Bankers are there?|`|VV7zNqQbaa	Why don't people ask the same questions about white elected officials who did not receive a majority of black votes?

Obviously not true:  Alan Keyes also ran for President and no black people voted for him.|`|97VqHCIRaa	NO.

They will not allow a white man with 20-30 years experience if a black or other minority wants the job, regardless of that minority's exp.   Pair that with Obamas own statements, and you have a definite YES to your question.

8a3bb05fac18cc11e58899cd0251e212aa	Geez, did anyone read the article?    It was about compromising between Reps and Dems on the economic stimulus using both Keynesian and Supply-side approaches to the economy to help.  Good for Rush, at least he's not telling people "I won, I trump you" King George maturity displayed by Obama.    People blame Bush for the failure of the last bailout without realizing that the Dems were in Congress and had control over where the money went...right into their pockets.|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	Wow.  A lot of objective commentary here.  The question raised was about Obama mistakenly (either wilfully or ignorantly) stating that the differences between Democrats and Republicans regarding the economic stimulus were "modest".  The differences are fundamental and monumental.  Democrats want to stimulate the economy by handing out money to everybody and anybody.  Republicans want to cut taxes to let people keep more of their own money.  I would say this is more than a "modest" difference.      As far as who is right, you need to look no further than 2 examples: FDR and Reagan.    FDR did exactly what the Democrats want to do now and it did nothing but further the depression.  It wasn't until the U.S. got involved in WWII and the manufacturing industry skyrocketed that we were able to pull out of the depression.    Reagan inhereted arguably one of the worst economies on record and turned it around by significantly cutting taxes. This caused the greatest economic growth the country had ever seen for over 2 decades.      What needs to happen is job creation.  The government does not and can not create jobs without taking more money from tax payers.  The private sector, however, CAN create real jobs.  They won't create jobs, though, if they think their going to be taxed into oblivion.|`|w4V0jOpbaa	'Republican(s) want to stimulate economic growth?'    Well, you could have fooled me!    Democrats want to stimulate economic growth by spending on infrastructure.    Read and educate yourself:  http://www.theweek.com/article/index/928...    From the article:    Attack of the Zombie Republicans    So after all the bipartisan ambience generated by the White House, the stimulus package passed the House of Representatives without a single Republican vote. The President says hell win over some Republicans in the Senate, but Arizona Republican John Kyl claims GOP support there is already eroding.    They wont admit it, but like the de facto leader of their party, Rush Limbaugh, Republicans want the President to fail. Their argumentsif one can dignify them as suchare by turns petty, dishonest or ignorant, ahistorical and ugly.    The pettiest point was their complaint about the modest funding for birth control in the original version of the House stimulus bill. Heaven forbidor at least Pat Robertson doesthat the poor would have access to family planning. So at the Presidents request, the provision was removed; the funding will come later in a different piece of legislation.    At least their quick, cheap hit on contraception lacked the intellectual slovenliness of their other objections. Once and future presidential candidate Mitt Romney told the GOP House retreat that the size of the recovery package threatened to set off hyperinflation. Either he was intentionally deceptive or, like George W. Bush, he slept through economics classes at Harvard Business School. The danger now is not inflation, but a descent into deflation. An economy with a paralyzed private sector needs public spending to create demand, production, and jobs.    But spending wont work, according to the conservative oppositionists. Look at the New Deal, they say, it failed! This Republican fiction assumes that in 1936 Americans suffered from mass delusion as they reelected FDR in a huge landslide. Apparently voters hadnt noticed his conspicuous failure in office.      Get it?|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Democratic President Obama's proposed policies are very similar to Democratic President Carter's policies.     Particularly proposals to tax and spend.   Carter also had  a Democratic Congress during his term, as well as media support that helped him get elected despite a lack of experience.    President Carter's tax and spend governing style destroyed the US economy, according to historical accounts and economists.     IMO, the present proposals from our democratic leadership will also damage the economy and prolong a recession.      Hence, IMO, Republican McCain's proposals were more realistic and were more likely to put the economy back on track.  I do not consider the differences modest.     Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia page on Jimmy Carter and the economy under his term:     "Ultimately, the combination of the economic problems, Iran hostage crisis, and lack of Washington cooperation made it easy for Reagan to portray him as an ineffectual leader, causing Carter to become the first president since 1932 to lose a reelection bid, and his presidency was largely considered a failure."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carte...    Also here is an excerpt from a ten part series describing Carter as America's worst president ever and outlining how Democrats still embrace policies similar to Carter's:    "In 1976, (when Carter was elected)  Americans thought they were sending an outsider to the White House"    Today, the same policies so thoroughly discredited by Jimmy Carter's disastrous presidency define the Democratic Party."    http://canadiancoalition.com/forum/messa...    People seem to have forgotten that the economy was doing very poorly during the Carter administration and that the media's support also helped get Carter elected, despite a lack of experience.    Many liberals who voted for Carter were later embarrassed.  This opened the way for Reagan, a  Republican.  Carter served only one term losing his re-election bid to Reagan.     The economy did well during Republican Reagan's term.     Read about it here:    http://canadiancoalition.com/forum/messa...    Carter also had a weak foreign policy approach and a reputation for subordinating US interest to foreign dictators.     Here is an informative link regarding his relations with dictators:     http://canadiancoalition.com/forum/messa...    Jimmy Carter was also ridiculed for his handling of the 1970s energy crisis. True enough, he didn't cause it. But he did make it much, much worse.    http://canadiancoalition.com/forum/messa...    Also Carter was supported and promoted by the media during his campaign and that helped him get elected and gave him very favorable ratings in opinion polls, despite the weakness of his proposals and their negative impact.     From Wikipedia: "The media discovered and promoted Carter. As Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book The Carter Presidency and Beyond:    What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media.    It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carte...    Carter's proposals failed to strengthen the economy despite a Democratic congress, according to historian Julian E. Zelizer.     From an article in Harvard business by Julian E. Zelizer a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School:      "Jimmy Carter found that all the political skill and savvy in the world did not compensate for lacking strong constituencies.    There were moments when this shortcoming did not matter, particularly when he still could rely on the momentum of his election. But as times become rougher, lacking coalitions was devastating."    http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/cs/2008...|`|seeRRQkraa	Are you aware that the "bail-out" rammed through by the Bush administration put BILLIONS of dollars in  BONUSES into the pockets of Wall Street CEOs?

When there is a national debt, every tax cut (which is not met with reduction in spending), every increase in government revenue, every dollar spent by government adds to the debt.

Now the Democrats are.  The differences is the depth of the recession we are in now, and what we need to to do pull out of it.  We need jobs, not tax cuts.  No amount of tax cuts will encourage business to hire unneeded workers, and until the country gets back to work, even the employed won't spend for fear that next month or next year they may lose their job.   We need to understand that the tax cuts need to be tightly targeted to increasing production here, not overseas.  I don't think that can be emphasized strongly enough, and it hasn't been done yet. By either side.  Hiring lags behind demand.  Since business isn't hiring, and in fact is laying off in huge numbers, the government has to do it or see the economy land face down.  No one wants that.  Hire Americans, for American jobs and we will pull out.  Give business tax cuts to continue to build foreign factories and we will never get out.

Recessions are a result of the end of economic expansion due to new product introduction. Whenever a new product is introduced to the world an economic boom results. Cheap mass produced autos brought the boom of the 1920s. War production brought the boom of the 1940s and early 1950s. Passenger jet production and space exploration brought the boom of the 1960s. Personal computers and the tech explosion brought the boom of the 1990s.  When these new products reach market maturity, a recession follows. The recession of 2001 was a result of tech market saturation on the worldwide market. Recession only abate when a new growth engine emerges. The government interfered with the nature market forces by creating an artificial growth engine: housing. By changing banking laws and allowing investment bank to invest in mortgage securities, the government allowed investment capital to be diverted from industrial development to mortgage debt. As a result, all investment capital went into the creation of debt, mortgages, instead of the creation of wealth thru new production.  Since 2001 there was zero capital invested in new IPOs the likes of Microsoft and Apple. There was no investment in American entrepreneurialship. The investment has solely been in debt, which is why we are in the situation we are in.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	Recessions are natural, and required to fix the problem governments create. Government should take no action to 'fix' them, because they simply nullify the cure.    Government policy drove up housing prices for example, and the recession lowers them to their natural prices. The same goes for other sectors effected.    Recession, and deflation is good for the citizens. Its bad for corporations and those who benefit from government intervention. Its bad for politicians who have million dollar investments in companies who directly benefit from their votes to steal citizens money and fund them.

The best way to get America permanently out of this mess is to increase middle class wages to the point where artificial stimulation of the economy by loosening credit (as has been done by every administration since Reagan including Clinton).

Certainly not in my book.|`|ymZsdMcAaa	Hillary is always doing something.She is working tirelessly to help the globalist break Americans will so it will be easier to bring us into the new world order.|`|K71Qoakwaa	Her very presence is repairing the damage to International Relations perpetrated by the Bush Administration.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	I think none of us has any idea what she is really doing, any more than we did with Condoleeza Rice or Colin Powell, or etc. etc.  Things happen at that level that we never hear about.|`|4Aauh87yaa	I feel sorry for the foreign people who have to actually meet her face-to-face.

NkEHCHsOaa	They have a history of support of democrats, and this type of thing is just pat for the UN. They are made up of countries which want to tear down the US, and democrats help them do it. They are allies against the strength of the US.<br>  <br>  Why did they do race surveys and all that in the LEAST racist country in the world?<br>  <br>  Why did they do a skewed reverse engineered quality of life farce of a survey to put the US quality of life below other countries in the survey, when that survey's criteria is so obviously cherry picked it's laughable?<br>  <br>  Because they wished to sway the election to help those who sell out the US, so they can feed off the fruits of our hard work and efforts for free, which the democrats help them do.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Whats that have to do with the election?|`|TYGgRjqDaa	You are surprised by this?  They have been close to this for a while.  Would this information have impacted our election in ANY way?

We are "working" with Obama.    Some Republicans want a stimulus package, but want to take out some things that won't create jobs.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Republicans just elected a black leader for their party.

They wanted to delay the porkulus package because they're fiscal Conservatives and that's what they do, cut out the pork.    Is every disagreement about race?  Grow up.|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Maybe it has to do with politics Ya think? Oh that's right the libs worked with Reagan and Bush Please go back to school and stop the racist bs|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	LOL - you should join Long Haired Freaky Person as a stand-up comic.    Republicans had no problem cooperating with Condoleeza Rice, JC Watts, Walter Williams, Alan Keyes... oh, but I forgot.  Since they're Republicans, they're somehow less black than President Obama.|`|avWArdYbaa	OMG.  Wow.  Wow.   This question is so laughable.  If not "cooperating" you mean not passing that joke of a bill, then the issue is with political disagreements.  NOT RACE.    Read the bill and you will understand what a good thing Republicans are doing by not signing off on this bill.  Here...I've pasted a link for you below.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	They want to be able to have clean hands for the 2010 and 2012 elections if the stimulus fails. I guess it doesn't matter to them how bad it gets for us common folk, losing our jobs, our savings and our hope for the future. It seems they can't be bothered to care about anything except their own personal power and prestige.    Not a good way to improve their reputation and reach out to new voters. The Republicans need a wake-up call, or they'll go the way of the Whigs. America does not have the patience for all this partisan crap right now. They're just digging their own graves.|`|iLkSVmSqaa	Race has nothing to do with it.  It is his policies.  He's a crook.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	Of course not.  It's a party thing.  Repubs don't play nice.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Here's some hints for you  Clarence Thomas  Rebublicans supported him for SCOTUS appointment  Dems called him Uncle Tom    Condoleeza Rice  Republicans appointed her to the most powerful position a woman or Black has been been appointed to  Dems called her Aunt Jemima    Colon Powel  Republicans appointed him to the highest military position any Black had ever been appointed to  Dems brought out the Uncle Tom reference again    Who exactly has the highest track record for discrimination again|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Because he's a communist and he's going to destroy everything this country was built on.  I hope they fight him tooth and nail and until their last breath!|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	No, you aren't.  Your question itself points to the reason that Republicans won't work with him, he's a Democrat.  Race isn't the issue here.|`|QGuxbItCaa	Obana is in a race?  What race?|`|xhpAiWPvaa	The problem is not our government but who is behind it always trying to make the parties fight so we dont actually open our minds to each other.|`|ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	wow you have to be kidding .... it might be because of his ideals like any other election ... but believe what you want|`|qYbFMRcUaa	its politics, not race.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	No.  They're against spending another trillion dollars on a plan that doesn't work.  Most of them were against Bush's stimulus and he was white.|`|9HdexsSCaa	"If President Obama was Republican, the Democrats would work with him"    Yeah, right. They were trying to string up the last Republican president from the minute he stepped into office. You are living in a dream world.|`|DyORD0Zkaa	to tell you the truth in reallity i think it is a slight reason because of his race but it is mostly because hes not from their party so they want to make his life really difficult|`|r6bEJNlyaa	There are also Dems against it too.  Or did that slip your mind.|`|AA11614944	I knew this would come up. It could not be that the "stimulus" package is just a huge spending spree to pay back liberal supporters? No, of course not, the liberals have to bring race into it.|`|OklApvU6aa	are there clan members in the senate elected by the democrat party....yes!    there are none in the republican side|`|cCwO36Ubaa	That could be. This is a new era for the nation and with change comes fear but I think it's because they don't think the stimuless package will work|`|TaHPzDIwaa	If Obama was white, Republicans wouldn't work with him. It's not race, it's politics. This was the same problem Jimmy Carter faced - people think Carter was a bad president but he was just undermined by bad Republican politicians during his administration.|`|Gwi2lCQHaa	No, it's because of the bad bill he is pushing.  Democrats had a chance to work with a Republican President and despite that President's continual efforts to reach out to them they refused..|`|ftbIWNydaa	Not really.  It is more about them being on the other side of the isle   than anything else.|`|NS7T70xLaa	Nope|`|sGpEe35Haa	Your racist comments are not needed. What you are seeing is a result of to much pork that Obama promised not to have. Besides many republicans voted for Obama too. Peace|`|iDq0PuSfaa	The refusal to cooperate is over policy not race.  Nancy made sure the house repub could not participate, they had no choice.|`|YTJ5Upneaa	This is a ridiculous question, why do you want to throw race in the mix? It has nothing to do with race it has to do with politics. Republicans and democrats have always been and will always be at odds with each other. If you think Obama is any difference than your naivety is really showing through. For one this stimulus is really just a big list of wasteful spending wrapped up in what he wants to call a stimulus, I hope they fight hard enough to get the waste out of this bill, and get true stimulus in.|`|ODTe2l77aa	Some of them.  But mostly, I just think they don't like him because he's a Democrat.    They would've probably been the same way had Al Gore been President.|`|TKbYavhzaa	Nah, I don't really think so, they're just sore losers.  And it's the house that really won't play ball; the senate is alright.    Hmm, I keep getting thumbs down, so I guess I must be wrong.  They're racist.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Yes that it. It has nothing to do with wanting to waste almost a trillion dollars.    Whats it like in that simple little world?|`|oojO4WAraa	No, it's not because of race.  It is because Obama is a democrat and the other guys are republicans.  Partisanship.  Sucks for Americans.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	It couldn't possibly be the fact that the Stimulus Package is loaded with money designated to programs that will not stimulate the economy, could it?  Nope, it has to be about race with you people.  How simple-minded.|`|BquqToGaaa	No. I don't see it. This is more about power, and making sure Obama doesn't get full credit if the stimulus package works.  Plain old politics, no racism.... yet|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Ya Betcha|`|wbIEau0qaa	ofcourse not, its just plain party vs party deal|`|B6c7BeDnaa	hardly.|`|w95ffy31aa	You're way off base.  Look into the so called stimulus package and you'll see so much waste there.  That's why they're opposing him. Anyone who thinks it makes sense to waste even more money in these economic times knows nothing about economics.  I would think a person is racist if they use the phrase "typical white folk", I'm sure you'd agree with that.|`|8ae90b5d4244804d72f29cc2c4f6d3bbaa	No.    They are true believers in capitalism and think that the best way to get out of a recession is to grow your way out....    Check it out:    http://online.wsj.com/article/SB11467030...|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Oh of course, It couldn't possibly be anything else. You people call everything under the sun racism.    You mean like Democrats worked with George Bush. How soon you forget.|`|3UTlASavaa	If a green eyed person does something stupid and I comment on how stupid it is that doesn't make me biased against green eyed people (in fact I actually like green eyes).  I am biased against stupidity.  You seem to be confusing concern over policy with concern over race.    Of course there are individuals in all walks of life who are biased against other races.  You can find examples constantly on both sides of the equation (my favorite "I can't be racist - I'm black", of course you can if you see every issue as one pitting black against white!).  This clouds the ability to see the real issues.    Republican concern over the stimulus bill has been clearly delineated.  The bill is a political sop to traditional Democratic causes and will not stimulate the economy in any significant way (unless you have given money or organized voting blocks for Democrats).  I have been pleased with the clarity of the Republican comments on the bill and their opposition on rational grounds.    Time to take off the blinders and look at what is actually being said rather than assuming that any criticism of the government is somehow due to race.|`|LMPK5WBaaa	Ohhhh cmon.... are you serious .....|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	opposition isn't racism

Is Obama really trying to make things better or does he have some deep desire to drive this country into ruin?  If so, he's doing a great job so far.

Attorney General Eric Holder's law firm represents 17 Gitmo terrorists and he is a driving force behind the closing of Gitmo.       On Inauguration Day, Obama granted only ABC News an interview, after they paid him $2 million to sponsor his DC Neighborhood Ball.       After three days in office, Obama ordered an attack on homes in Pakistan. Twenty-one people were killed but only five were reported to have been terrorists; the rest of the incinerated and dismembered victims were children, their moms and dads, and other civilians, according to the New York Times, the AFP, the AP and many other news sources.       On 23 January 2009, Obama demanded that GOP leaders stop listening to Rush Limbaugh or else things would not go well for them during his regime.       William Lind, a powerful defense industry lobbyist, was appointed by Obama to be deputy defense secretary, despite all the rants and promises Obama made about never appointing a lobbyist to a position of power in his regime.       On 23 January 2009, Obama lifted the ban on federal tax dollars funding abortion mill operations in Third World countries where eugenics are now again used to control the population.       Two days after seizing power, Obama signed an executive order to close Gitmo, making it clear that the comfort and happiness of the terrorists therein, and Europe's opinion of us, are far more important than national security and the lives of American families.       Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refuses to reveal all of the big foreign donors to her husband's "foundation," but the Washington Times says huge sums of money came from the People's Republic of China via a secret 2006 stock transaction.       On 24 January 2009, despite his hundreds if not thousands of pledges and promises of total transparency in his regime, Obama held a secret closed-door meeting with his economic advisors as anger over his $1 trillion "economic stimulus" spending scheme, refusing to allow the media and American people access to what was discussed.       On 26 January 2009, Rep. John Boehner revealed that Obama and his Obamanistas in the Congress had added language in the Democrats' stimulus bill that would allow Obama's infamous voter fraud organization, ACORN, to receive billions of dollars in federal funding under the farcical guise of "neighborhood stabilization activities."       On 26 January 2009, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice, stated that the Obama regime seeks direct negotiations with the terrorist regime of Iran.       In a shocking insult to our military's heroes, on 20 January 2009, Barack Obama became the first president in 56 years--since its inception--to skip the Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball, which is held in honor of Medal of Honor recipients, Purple Heart recipients, paralyzed veterans and other military heroes. Obama did, however, find time to attend the Neighborhood Ball, which was filled with Hollywood's ultra elite.       On 26 January 2009, with hat in hand and apologizing for the United States, Obama gave his first formal television interview as president not to an American network, but Al-Arabiya, saying America must stop "dictating," a move and statement that was immediately seen by extremist Muslims as a sign of sure weakness and fear.       James B. Steinberg, whom Obama nominated to be deputy secretary of state, told the Foreign Relations Committee in writing that Americans have a free speech right guaranteed by the Constitution to taxpayer funded abortions.       On 26 January 2009, Timothy Geithner was sworn in as Obama's secretary of the treasury despite having serious tax problems and having had an illegal alien housekeeper.       On 27 January 2009, Obama, for some reason confused, attempted to walk through a window to get back into the White House rather than using a door. There were no calls from liberals to have him take a urinalysis to determine why he did this.       The Obamanistas added $325,000,000 to the economic stimulus bill for a program to teach Americans how not to get the clap and other STDs. More additions:     The Obamanistas added $1.5 billion to run a contest to capture carbon.       The Obamanistas added $45 million for ATV trails.       The Obamanistas added $572 million to create 1,235 Coast Guard civilian jobs at $460K each.       The Obamanistas added $4 billion for Obama's voter fraud unit that is under federal investigation for massive fraud.       The Obamanistas added $3.5 billion for new education facilities.       The Obamanistas added $200 million for DoD alternative energy vehicles.       The Obamanistas added $600 million for new government cars.       The Obamanistas added $134 million for hospices.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	I support the Office of the Presidency.

I'm not sure he wants to call the police if she does, though, since the situation's bad enough, unless she's violent or threatening toward him, in which case, he would be able to get an order against her.  But you're right for not passing on the messages or info.<br>  <br>  Your mother may have rights to court-ordered visitation in some states, provided she has a close relationship with the children, and her son does not object, should she be denied the children completely.  However, I strongly caution that as a very last resort.  The children will benefit from you and your mother having as good a relationship with their mother as possible.<br>  <br>  So, hang in there, hun.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: She's either very immature or emotionally unstable.  Either way, your brother's better off to keep his distance.

Firstly, it is not "the Government" but the judiciary that remands people for trial - under separation of powers it is a judicial, not an executive decision.<br>  <br>  Up here in Scotland, if you're facing a serious charge, such as murder, rape or terrorism offences, then you must be indicted within 80 days of your committal (which is within eight days of your first appearance). You must appear before a judge to tender your plea within 110 days, and where appropriate, your trial must start within 140 days unless, with permission of the court, either prosecution or defence are granted an adjournment on cause shown.<br>  <br>  In effect therefore, twenty-one weeks should be enough time to prepare and prosecute most serious cases. Extensions to six or seven months being granted by the court are not unknown, but it's very rare indeed for someone to be held for trial for longer than that.|`|fyhl3TQgaa	Two weeks maximum, imagine if you were wrongly accused of something, and no evidence could be found, you'd feel gutted if you were locked away for no reason.<br>  <br>  The magna carta: 'To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice'.|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	In the case of enemy combatants, until the war is over.

This includes upholding  Constitution (state, federal and municipal where applicable)  and upholding the laws and treaties which as an elected official they are bound to do.    The point is that political decisions can be criminal decisions, and becuase a politician has taken and oath he or she is bound to a higher standard.  They are accountable to the people and their actions absolutely should be scrutinized.    True democracy only functions when the people have knowledge of the intentions of government, and have a say in how their government is run.  Failing those very important things, democracy ceases to exist and we are left with oligarchy  or dictatorship.|`|gO1iAm99aa	Q. What's the best way for a politician to do almost nothing (of consequence) for most of their term, while having a "high & mighty" iron-clad, indisputable excuse for that nothing?    A. Either lead, chair a committee on corruption/crime/wrong-doing of one of your own, (talk about a Good-ol-Boys Club) be an investigator for, look over the "facts", make determinations, advise, partake in a discovery "task-force/farce", call witnesses, conduct interviews, and generally play with yourself for four years.    Don't fall for it again people, it's a "Hey look at me I'm doing something" SCAM.   Vote yes or No on the first day. If guilty fire them, make them permanently ineligible for further government service, yank their pension, sell off their assets to re-pay fines & penalties or to pay back stolen monies. Hard time, no country-club jails for hard crime.    Just like they do for/to us.|`|U50orfPhaa	No but he will probably get Tony Rezko pardoned and Kirkpatric maybe some terrorists too..|`|AA10465540	Janet Reno was investigated.

OiAl6w48aa	Just given the historical rate, I would think there is a good chance of the birth mother being awarded primary custody since she is not an unfit mother, and the fact that the child seems to want to return to her.  However, given how your husband has stepped up to the plate and taken care of him and been involved in his life, I would assume that he will receive some form of joint custody and will be allowed generous visitation over weekends and vacations.<br>  <br>  So long as both parents show a willingness and ability to productively participate in a child's life, the modern court view is that both parents deserve as much time as possible with their kids.  Obviously, there needs to be some balancing of the interests since kids have to go to school (and you can't be moving them back and forth all the time over the school week) and things like that, so one parent always ends up with "more" time with the child than the other parent.|`|RgO3Sn38aa	It's a tough call.  Nothing is better than a two parent home, but if the seven year old says he wants to be with his mother, and she is a good mother and provider, then chances are the Judge will rule in her favor.|`|23c99fcd4aa2aac54a97abdb713c5f5eaa	Alot of court's are now awarding joing physical custody. If this child want's to live with his mother and she can provide better care then that's where he needs to be. Personally though I've gone to school and raised 2 children at the same time while also holding down a full time job, I could never just have visiting time with my kids it would kill me, so it's hard for me to comprehend how someone could give up their child for that in the first place.
Jwk7Ib2vaa	It means that you are using your right to not answer the question at hand for risk of admitting guilt (incriminating yourself).<br>  Although this doesn't automatically mean you are guilty, a jury may take that as a sign that you have something to hide. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA11206283	You don't incriminate yourself.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	You stop talking to cops who try to fool you with their questions designed to incriminate you guilty or not. So by these clowns reasoning anyone picked up suspected of a crime, guilty or not is automatically guilty for not admitting to guilt. So you're at home watching TV and the cops break down your door and you refuse to tell them where the loot is buried even though you have nothing to do with the crime you're guilty only for not saying you did it. Interesting.<br>  I always thought the 5th simply means you don't have to admit to crimes you didn't commit.|`|AA10258539	Of course you can.

For example if you get pulled over and your drunk, you can choose to not take the alcohol test and choose to plead the 5th. Yes the cops will arrest you, but they cannot charge you with DIU. This is because since you elected not to take the Alcohol test they dont have any proof that you where drunk. This works, I have asked lawyers and police officers, and both have said the same thing. But police officers get pissed off because they cant do anything. This are our rights and they cant violate them.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	you automatically look guilty.

I want to see the evidence before I judge the man, its called innocent until proven guilty and its the American way.  I think the prosecutor deliberately tainted the jury pool because hes hasn't got the airtight case we have been led to believe.  Usually they say "No comment, the case is active" not "here boys, listen to three minutes of tapes without context and hang him high."    I don't know if the guy is guilty or innocent, I just know something more than him shooting off his mouth stinks out there.|`|WDWtHcK4aa	Everyone knows it  Chicago politicians make me sick they are filthy rotten pigs that happen to be smooth talkers.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	There are politicians from Alaska and from Louisiana and Texas that are  trying to give those from Chicago a run for the title.|`|SahUDTLnaa	Yes we should ban all Chicago politicians like they were rattle snakes. because they are worse.|`|AA10465540	The capitol of Illinois is not Chicago.|`|plZFYzlZaa	Dude...Gitmo is WAY not cool.

I would tell them where the local homeless shelter, soup kitchen and food bank is.<br>  <br>  I live in a large city and this is common (although they usually ask for cash).  I've known people who did this for a living.  Yes, they made a good living at panhandling.  They'd dress in ragged clothes and go to work just like I did.  Only they made more money and their income wasn't taxable.  One man made about $35k a year and I knew a woman who made a little over $40k a year.  Of course this was all net income.<br>  <br>  I've see the scams every day.  Once, I gave money to a man and then watched him go to the drive through and buy a bottle.  Another time a man at a grocery wanted cash and I offered to buy him food.  He went outside to my then-boyfriend in the car and told him that I said to give him five dollars.  There's a couple near the interstate that pull the ploy about running out of gas and needing money for gas.  They've been in the city for over a year pulling that one over and over again.  And then there is the guy about a mile from here that stopped me (while I was driving) to ask for cab fare to go see his mother who was taken to the hospital.  Not-so-surprisingly, he stopped me three times in a four month period with the same story each time.  For a while I always had drunks on my front porch in the mornings.  Sure, I offered to take them to the shelter but none of them would go.  Ever.<br>  <br>  I know there are legitimate people in need but I can't fund every bum in the city.  I volunteer my time at the homeless shelter and donate to the food bank.  I am more than happy to let people know where these resources are.

Whoever is telling you that is spinning you.  There was precious little manufacturing going on in the U.S. before NAFTA.  Do you know why?  Because of two reasons:  <br>  1) Extreme Environmental regulations <br>  2) A tort system that allows anyone to sue companies without regard for the merrits of the case and astronomical jury awards.<br>  <br>  Here is an example.  The auto industry in America needs components and chemicals to produce their cars.  But, the process to manufacture many of those components produce toxic waste.  As happened in my own company, after doing everything possible to midigate that waste there there will still be a modest amount that has to be disposed of.  <br>  <br>  Well, environmental regulations required that we package it a certain way, hire a Federally licensed waste hauler and dispose of it in a Federally licensed landfill.  However, after we comply with all of those regulations, if any of that waste for any reason at any time in the future leaks out our company will be still be liable.  So, if the hauler spills it or the landfill mishandles it or if the Federal mandates in the landfill were inadequate or even if a meteor hit the landfill and splashed the waste around, we would be on the hook.<br>  <br>  Whether you believe in environment controls or not, such regulations are not designed to contol such industries but to insure they go out of business.  Now, pretty much every process that is in any way dirty, is no longer done in America.  So, either our remaining manufacturing companies get their components from some other country or they do not get them at all.<br>  <br>  Ironically, when those processes were performed here, not only did it provide employment but it allowed us to control the pollution.  Does anyone believe that in third world countries that are now performing those processes they are taking any sort of measures not to pollute the earth?<br>  <br>  So, despite the best of intentions by Liberal Environmentalists, they have not only forced jobs out of America but guaranteed at least a hundred times more pollution will be produced elsewere.<br>  <br>  *|`|J0YS28Ysaa	impossible. communist china are the true capitalists. the chinese gov stays out of the private sector allowing them to keep manufacturing costs and labor costs low. this passes on the saving to the consumers = the USA. obama should have let fannie mae and freddie mac fail, and allowed the real estate catastrophe to end. yes it would have been a worse recession but it would have showed our foreign trading partners that we are committed to the preservation of the dollar. they have no faith in us now. china has already commented on how irresponsible we are and that it would push for its citizens to invest domestically. this will bring the US to its knees. obama is only making it worse<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  and china is not dependent on us. that is a lie the gov tells you to keep you spending your goold old american cash so that they can borrow more to finance our growing debt<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  kudos jacob- thank you for enlightening everyone here|`|pGAUjHwvaa	I am sorry for being such a dolt, how exactly did the republicans "give" China its industrial might?

He was redirecting the fight to Afghanistan and other spots around the world-again nothing more than the SecDef had proposed over a year ago.<br>  What others are saying, is correct-in a limited way.  To get the nomination-AND have a shot at keeping the Dems united he had to court the left-wing of the Democratic Party (the people who would otherwise have voted for Nader or someone like that had Clinton been nominated).  The single best way to garner their votes is to say something about a speedy withdrawal. If you watched the Dems debate, you might remember this issue was one that Hillary Clinton really pummeled Obama on...|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	I watched closely. Obama got his top secret briefing on a Thursday, and the very next day started acting and speaking more and more like Bush. It seems that presidential candidates do not have the information to make credible promises. The people do not have enough information to make credible choices, either. Generally the information is withheld under the claim of "national security risk". Ironic isn't it; the idea of national security makes our *national* form of government impossible.<br>  <br>  We see it in all aspects of government, from law to lobbying.

He has consulted with General Petreus, and with the Pentagon about draw down strategies.  And he is reviewing them, and he will make the right decision.  He doesn't want to send Iraq spiraling into chaos, and the men and women in uniform serving there don't want that either.|`|FsBUKc1vaa	He said he would still listen to the generals because, as just a campaigner, at that time he did not have all the information.

I listened very carefully to the campaigns, and what they each said.  Obama always said that it would be done carefully, at the pace of 1-2 brigades per month, but always based upon the conditions on the ground for the safety of the troops.  I always heard him say he hoped it could be done within 16 months (which would be 2010, by the way, there are only 12 months in a year).<br>  <br>  I guess you really don't understand how withdrawing the troops is done.  It's not done but just pulling them out, it's done by allowing each Brigade to finish out their tour and not replacing them with someone new.<br>  <br>  The withdrawl has already begun.  Those extra 17,000 going to Afganistan were already slated to go to Iraq.  So those Brigades that are leaving will not have someone new to replace them.  That is withdrawing them.<br>  <br>  He also always, always, always said that the real fight is in Afganistan, and that they would be redirected there.  Although we won't have two fights going on, so hopefully the deployment tempo can slow down a bit.|`|VeWD8Io2aa	Sorry richgeasey, but if you watched the video he did. I heard "Two Brigades a month" and "out by Mar 31st next year". Before you post try and get all the facts.<br>  What you saw over the course of the election was a politician using the popular belief at the time to endear himself to the public. He never had any plans to bring troops home. Hell a first year intern in the national security advisors office could have told you it was impossible. Logistically and realistically.  He told everyone what they wanted to hear. Now I do think that maybe he went into it trying to keep that promise, but on "day 1" he entered the oval office and learned how things really work. Now he has to dance the "Patomic two step" along with everyone else.|`|IDZTtipeaa	As one person pointed out, he is keeping in line with his promises regarding Iraq (if you listened to his entire speeches instead of cut-up Youtube clips from 2007 where he says he wanted a withdrawal, then put forward legislation which was eventually voted down).<br>  He said he wants a phased withdrawal and proposed time-lines, always contingent on approval from generals on the ground and safety of Iraqi's and our troops.<br>  <br>  Certainly there are promises he has circumvented and disregarded (an unfortunate and not excusable part of all campaigns), but this is not one of them.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	And this SURPRISES you?<br>  <br>  That a politician would say whatever he thinks people want to hear, in order to get elected?<br>  <br>  I'd be more concerned about Iran putting satellites into orbit, or North Korea doing missile tests, or Russia rattling its saber once again -- all these challenges to America's authority, and Obama likely won't do squat to stand up to them...|`|TSsT8QGgaa	i have often wondered how MANY years,,,and how MANY elections will it take for people to realize that politicians say things during campaigns that NEVER come true,,,things that they change.  that and i will NEVER understand why people try to debate an issue with youtube as a reference.

Basically, the only thing you have to be responsible for is your bed, your clothes, and your body. the rest of the time your told what to do, when to do, and how to do it. so no responsibilities. I also had some good RDC's (basically, drill sergeants) so that probably made it better, they would yell at us a lot yeah, but they would also joke around with us. <br>  <br>  Ship life - Ship life can be both fun and hard. We were deployed for 9 months, the longest at the time when we were deployed. You really get to know people when you live with them for 9 months and the farthest you can get away from them is about 400 yards. It also causes you to be more empathetic with people as well. you make a lot of good friends when your out to sea, unfortunatly most people lose touch when they transfer. I've been to more countries, and been drunk in more countries, than anyone i know, other than my father, but he was in the navy when they actually pulled into cool places.  <br>  <br>  If I could go back and change my mind about joining, I wouldn't.

I would recommend you work with a broker that allows you to store the gold with a 3rd party.<br>  <br>  Some will try to sell you a plan and store your gold but I would stay away from them. It becomes too easy for them to get reckless with your assets. Stick to a 3rd party. <br>  <br>  Lastly, stay away from Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) or any other paper note that only claims you own gold. If you don't have possession of it, you don't own it.

lPwdDpxgaa	Neither - because I know from personal experience ALL about politics.  No politician is a 'free man (or woman)'.  All are selected, groomed, and controlled by someone else.  The term is 'king-maker'.  These people have their agenda, and choose candidates who will best promote that agenda.  Sometimes the 'king-makers' have both the Democratic AND Republican candidates in the same race, in their pockets (example - the last presidential election).  In order for you to accurately form an opinion, you need to know who is behind the candidate and what their agenda is, in spite of the rhetoric you will hear from the candidate.  They are owned, lock, stock and barrel, and if they do not follow orders, they will be removed.  The favorite mantra of the 'king-makers' is "I put you there, and I can bring you down".    For this reason, I do not belong to a political party because I know that  they are just 'fronts', and that partisan loyalty is for the naive.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	When I first registered to vote at 18, I registered as an Independent.

Under some circumstances, the concepts developed by Republicans are best for what ails us. At other times, the Democrats should be in the leadership position. Both parties have their good and their bad points...and their own views. And it also depends on who the party leadership is. Not all Presidents follow a strict party line on all issues...so that is a factor also.    And one other factor that I consider is the number of either party in the house and senate. I do not like to see a vast majority being held by either party as I believe it encourages partisanship and encourages run away passage of bad bills...either side.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Independent - I'm not afraid to stand on my own.

56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa	In a communist country the State (Govt) owns all the resources and no private property ownership is allowed. The State de facto means the Communist Party at the helm for ever. There is no election and no dissent view to the State policies are allowed. Just like a private dictatorship, here a group of party men shall dictate the laws - not just of community consequence, but private life like marriage and child birth, because they have an impact on community commitments (to feed and shelter etc).     You would have heard how in China people can not get married or bear a child of their own volition and there are regulations to allow certain number of marriages and child births annually.    Well. To brief, there shall be no personal liberty  to choose your job and place.. to express your ideas particularly on govt policy, religion etc. For the communists do not consider religion necessary but as evil that impose irrational prescriptions..    But the salutary features are the planned growth and development of the nation.. In a democracy we see how the elected govts struggle to implement any programme due to the opposition to every measure from some quarter.. The private liberty is often misused to stall any productive efforts.. This problem is not there in a communist country..!    China had made its high population as an asset to achieve lot of things.. It produces cheap materials using the people - even the prisoners.. It does not complain the population as a burden (though through its regulated child birth efforts the further growth has been minimised)..    But the few at the helm of administration are after all humans and could be too autocratic in imposing tough laws.. no question could be raised.. The courts are manned by party men and any anti govt activity would be considered a serious treason and the accused person heard in a summary trial and sent to labour camp (as prisons are called)..    Of late, the communists have also partially embraced the capitalist strategies of allowing private / foreign investments for speedy growth of economy.. but there are still regulations to limit the investments etc..    Every ideology, socialist (communist in political parlance) or capitalist (democratic) have their merits and suffer some serious defects in actual implementation due to the basic weakness of people who use them..     If capitalist economy under democracies encouraging private enterprises suffers from acute exploitation of the common people (work force exploitation according to communists), the socialist group is too regimentative and lacks incentive to private merits and contributions.. in work, art or thoughts..     However, the world has seen corruption at high levels in democracies as well as communist countries like China.. Only thing is the facts will not leak from a communist nation easily due to absence of free Press..!    India tried to adopt the merits of both and opted for what was called "mixed economy" or politically as "democratic socialism" which did not make much headway.. Mr Rajaji criticised the Congress (which gave the ideology and ruled for a long time at the Centre and in many States) as Permit Licence Quota Raj mentioning the three important features considered as "safety valves" to curb private monopoly / domination, as actually contributing in practice to high official and political misuse of the powers and encouraging corruption..    Years later, from 1990s the Congress itself has adopted Free Enterprise under WTO agreement as Economic Reforms and bade good bye to socialistic pursuits.. Thus Mr Rajaji's dream of free economy has come true.. but you find the evils of exploitation already cropping up..! We have alway to choose from one of two evils..! (conversely every merited activity is corrupted to evil by our greed..)    Hope this brief helps..!|`|gLXzVbm8aa	Cuba has communism.

Communism is is a socioeconomic structure and political ideology that promotes the establishment of an egalitarian, classless, stateless society based on common ownership and control of the means of production and property in general.      The concept is ok, but it doesnt work b/c people dont act that way.  90% of people live close to poverty and the top 10% are very corrupt and have everything and then some.  I dont think its evil though, i lived in the country that had that system for a while.  As an everyday citizen its ok, you have enough to feed the family, free healthcare, etc...but that's about it.  You cant really strive for anything higher b/c it doesnt exist for the regular working class.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Communism is just the lack of private property.  You don't own anything.

Capitalism and neo liberalism advocates the free market thereby the fittest will survive (Jungle Rule).

Cuba is classical example. (Soviet Union was an example in  the past).

Spending taxpayer money like it's water, when it hasn't proven and likely will never prove that it is going to help this economy, is the dopiest thing our government, our darling President, has done yet.<br>  <br>  He has a lot of nerve telling mayors what to do when he has made an asz load of terrible decisions thus far.|`|2932956ec7662d7544675f368775f540aa	If he did not tell those Mayors straight up that they will be held responsible for the accounting and use of the funds then they would merely taken it for " Business as Usual " and went on their merry way wasting and squandering the funds on pet projects and into various associates pockets, as they have always done in the past. When you make it clear up-front that if you screw it up you will be held accountable then perhaps they will actually use the funds for the intended purposes.

By the way 50 years ago the age of majority was 21 that did not mean it was illegal to date a 20 year old.<br>  <br>  You won't be able to marry her in the US until she turns 18, however, as she is close to 18 the police will be less likely to deal with her in a runway situation.<br>  <br>  IF she signs out of school or gets a GED then you won't have to worry about truancy either.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	why (besides the obvious) would you want to be with a girl who is 17?  i remember being 17, and my girlfriends were friggin' nuts!!!!  talk about immature...|`|95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	The following answer comes from a Catherine NeSmith, Executive Director of AARDVARC.org, Inc. to a question similar to yours:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.expertlaw.com/forums/showthread.php?t=51437" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertlaw.com/forums/showthre...</a><br>  "...Correct - the age of consent in Ohio is 16 (see 2907.04 Unlawful sexual conduct with minor). If the minor was 15 or under, an age differential would apply (for example you can't be an x number of years older than her if she were 15, in Ohio). Since she is of lawful age to consent, it's not an issue.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER - until she reaches the age of majority (18 in Ohio) - her parents still have total legal control over her, including who she gets to see, date, where she goes, etc. Be emotionally and legally prepared for her parents to forbid this relationship. If they do so, and things get ugly (or if she should get pregnant), all sorts of OTHER problems are possible for you - including restraining orders, and possible criminal charges for things like contributing to the delinquency of a minor, harboring a runaway, etc. <br>  <br>  Things NOT to do:<br>  <br>  1) Get her pregnant (contrary to popular belief, this will NOT legally emancipate her - it will only give her MEDICAL emancipation to determine medical care for herself and the child - period). If her parents don't approve of this relationship, you can be certain that they will keep you two apart via legal means. Yes, you'll still likely get visitation with the baby, but that visitation WON'T include her until she's 18. <br>  <br>  2) Take for granted that she's using birth control, just because she tells you she is. Biggest and longest running scam on earth. NEVER EVER believe a teenage girl who tells you she's on the pill and can't get pregnant. Wrap that rascal - every time.<br>  <br>  3) Keep her from fully applying herself to school. She needs to be there everyday, and actively working on her education. Don't let her skip school to hang with you - it'll hurt her education, and give the parents ammunition against you, including possible criminal charges as noted above.<br>  <br>  Things TO do: (assuming the parents still let her see you)<br>  <br>  1) Respect that her parents are still her legal guardians, and she must live under their rules until she hits 18. You can either make things funner for you, but harder for her at home, or more responsible for both of you, and an easier time for her at home. You might be facing a big hurdle in her parents - and the only way you'll have a chance in overcoming it is to show that your interest in their daughter goes beyond wanting to bang her until the cows come home. SHOW that you have HER best interests at heart, and that you're not just thinking with the lower part of your anatomy (cause that's what they're going to think). HELP her to stay in school, do WELL in school, stay off drugs, be home when she's supposed to, etc.<br>  <br>  2) In case you're wondering, the age for consent to marriage in Ohio is 16 with parental consent, and 18 without it."<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  You really need to get a speedy divorce (if you haven't done yet) before touching that girl. Adultery charges by dating a girl under 18 can get you in serious troubles: delinquency of a minor or interfering with custody of a minor for example; and don't forget your ex will get the best part during the divorce if the Judge find out about you dating a 17 years old girl.<br>  Also don't forget that in theory you can go to jail for adultery (rarely enforced this days but you never know).|`|AA11065140	In Ohio, the age of consent is 16, so no, you are entirely within the law.<br>  <br>  Personally, I find it unfortunate that any state would have their laws say it's okay for a minor to have sex, but it is what it is.|`|f6qmRicQaa	Legally it all depends on the age of consent in your state.  If it is 17 then no, you can't get in any legal trouble.  That being said you need to think of the moral ramifications of dating a girl (note I said GIRL) who is not yet fully matured.  And no 17 is not fully matured.  If you really love her then give her a few years to experience life, or you will regret it because she will change on you eventually too, it's called maturing.|`|qwaWd14vaa	You left your wife.

Your picture will be on the sexual offenders website and any job you get for the rst of your life will know also. So do what you have to do.

9FSHsHrNaa	One of the Army Generals on News yesterday said that the causalities in Iraq have almost come to a stand still, so I guess round 1 of the war against terror has been won!<br>  He also said that the War in Afghanistan is going to make the war in Iraq look like child play....<br>  <br>  Harry Reid is one of those who can only claim victory on the success of someone else!|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	No one won the war, its done pretty much what I always thought we would do, we declare we won, and leave.<br>  There are still daily shooting and bombing.  The country isn't safe or rebuilt.  There are terrorists now where there hadn't been before.<br>  And despite elections there isn't peace between the differing factions.<br>  But now we won.<br>  Just in time to go into Afghanistan, and maybe this time get Osama?|`|1pB2Cr6Faa	Our brave men and women won the War, while Reid sat around playing with himself.....|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	I guess moveon.org said he could change his opinion.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Link please.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is the war was not won or lost.  The enemy is in the process of relocating to Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  Please do not think of Iraq or Afghanistan as discrete, singular "wars" that may be won or lost.  We are fighting a real enemy whose goal is a caliphate (you can look it up).  This battle will go on for a long, long time unless the US (Obama, perhaps) can get the cooperation of Arab/Muslim nations to fight the enemy with/for us.  The battlefield will be Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, Kashmir, and so forth.  When that ends the action will move to Africa.<br>  <br>  We are in the top of the second inning.  Nothing has been won, or lost, yet.  With the possible exception of our moral leadership.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	it was pure hate of Bush regardless the troops while i think we can win in Afghanistan even if Obama is in charge, see the difference!

Her family did not get up there and make public speeches about politics for her....not like Obama's wife did. Obama's wife put herself right out there in the open and then people wonder why she was criticized.<br>  <br>  Plain fear.

84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	You will go to jail for assault, not fighting, and have that conviction on your record.  If you go out of your way to pick a fight with him the fact that he hits first will be immaterial.  When you directly seek a fight, he is entitled to defence, and so long as he doesn't pull a gun or knife, you will never be able to prove he started the fight.  You sound like a punk, and that is what you will look like in court.  You will also totally alienate your mother, she has already told you to butt out.  If you go ahead with this juvenile plan, enjoy your time with your new room-mate, Bubba, the 250 lb guy with the tattoos.  If you drop the soap, leave it on the floor.    Now I have to ask, what were you doing on the solicitation pages of Craigslist?|`|2JJLYSAKaa	This piece of &^*% is not worth it.  Not worth it.  You go to his house - you are provoking the situation and it doesn't matter who hits who first.  He is not worth it.    What good is this going to do?  You will be arrested.  You don't know how this is going to escalate.  Gun or knife.  You will be rotting in jail with charges - you are only 18.  This 43 year old is going to be out and messing around on your Mom.  Get your mom out of there.  Why is she staying with this garbage??|`|FdA7zXfcaa	Hitting you first is not true. You can still goto jail even if he hits you first. You both will end up in jail.  You will be seen as an aggressor or "starter" because you went to him.  If you want an honest and mature answer for your question then you should do nothing at all except maybe give the information to your mother. She deserves that.   If you goto his house and get arrested then she has to deal with loosing her husband to other women and her son being in jail. I think that one is enough, dont give her the extra burden of dealing with you in jail.    Your mom will appreciate it more if you just tell her and let her deal with it.     DONT GO TO JAIL YOUR MOM IS GONNA NEED YOU FOR SUPPORT.    Good luck|`|Em88Qn3Oaa	DH is also me and I agree with me. Support your mom!!!!!!!!

ZEbyBqZ1aa	Actually the officers sole reason for pulling the kid over was expired tags.  That clearly was a lie which means he officer had no reason to pull him over other then profiling.  Profiling someone is illegal but is very hard to prove almost impossible... you can only look at the trends with regards to race and traffic stops and believe me their very disproportionate and the trends have actually been used in a profling case against New Jersey state troopers.  Theres a disproportionate rate of pulling over African Americans when compared to other races and theres no explanation for it other then profling.  You can't do anything about it legally especially since you didn't get in trouble.|`|jfEjTjL6aa	put the cell phone away, turn the stereo down, quit dressing like a clown and drive the speed limit they will leave you alone|`|shtP63traa	Nope.<br>  <br>  It's non-issue.

What exactly is it the cop did wrong? He can pull you over for any reason. You were shaking, it was your first time and now you think you're going to get the cop back? It's people like you who make it worse for everyone else. You want sue for anything, you want to cause problems and make things worse because you didn't like being pulled over and that's why laws get changed. <br>  <br>  Chalk it up to experience and quit being a baby. He did nothing wrong. You're going to have a lot of worse experiences driving in your future.<br>  <br>  What he did was NOT "illegal" and the only thing "offensive" is your post.
jJhItbu7aa	Possibly, there is no real way of knowing unless you go to MEPS for the Army.

Talk to an Army recruiter and work with them to meet requirements. In the end it only benefits you to loose the weight. "truncation" is not a good thing to have in a "fit" service!|`|Fj2Wo2M2aa	Re code of three simply means you have to wait a certain ampout of time before trying to re enter that particular branch of service. Most of the time a recruiter will ask you to write some sort of letter to their station commander asking for a waiver and also depending on what the code is for show some kind of progress. For instance if someone got chaptered for overweight and got the same code he/she would have to show progress in weight lose like maybe one weigh in a week or two.. thats just an example
nwMBfgcdaa	Attend an information presentation.   Contact the locate recruiting center for dates and times (you can get that inforamtion on the site below).  <br>  Then you write the exam.  It is a multiple choice test (114 questions), designed to evaluate your potential aptitude for police work. It measures seven skills that are essential in completing the duties of a police officer: composition (spelling, grammar and vocabulary), comprehension, memory, judgement, observation, logic and computation.<br>  If you pass, you move on.  Before they needed alot more people than they could get, you used to have to score in the top 10 percent, so passing didn't mean you would move on.  <br>  You have to complete the PARE test (physical abilities requirement test?), it is six laps around an obstacle course with jumps, stairs and controlled falls.  Then you push/pull an 80 lbs weight in six arcs each.  Has to be done under 4:30 to pass, 4:00 to graduate (i think, something like that)<br>  Then you have your interview.  <br>  At one point you will complete a  polygraph.  They will send you a book that you fill out all the questions.  It pretty much covers anything that is illegal.  You tell them what you did.  Then the polygraphist reviews the book with you, then you will be put on the polygraph.  They don't ask you all the questions, but the questions are pretty general.  You are only actually on the polygraph for maybe 20 minutes but the whole process takes about 3 hours.  <br>  Someone will complete background check on you.  There is also a psych test and the usual health tests.

Esoteric computer skills are always in demand.  Of course, U.S.based, desk bound analysts are always employed.  These are usually university graduates specialized in specific geographical regions.  Forensic accountants are also valued.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, the clandestine nature of the job will entail quite intrusive background checks to ensure that you don't have questionable allegiances contrary to U.S. interests and that you have no financial or moral weaknesses exploitable by adversaries.<br>  <br>  In short, if you're quite willing to kiss your privacy goodbye, that's a plus.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Now.... no problem.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	If you have an illegal immigrant nanny and cheat on your taxes, you could be appointed to run it!

SPsYrJJEaa	BLACKBURN V. ALABAMA, 361 U. S. 199 (1960) -- US Supreme Court Cases ...<br>  United States Supreme Court Cases & Opinions ... But this case is novel only in the sense that the evidence of insanity here is ...
SPsYrJJEaa	Spousal rape is part of what feminists call an epidemic of rape--date rape, acquaintance rape, random violence rape. Women who lobby to change rape laws do so with the true perception that the vast majority of rape assaults are committed by perpetrators women already know. For this reason, spousal rape is a major concern of feminists and other social reformers. In fact, spousal rape is especially insidious when one considers that the victims continue to live with their attackers.<br>  The definition of rape will be examined so that a clear understanding of past and present law is possible. Next, a discussion of the history of spousal rape as a current issue will show how much of a non-issue is has been for those critical of the entire concept. Finally, a survey of news articles will show the extent to which spousal rape is indeed an important issue, and not what some critics call, "a contradiction in terms."<br>  <br>  Rape can be defined as an act of aggression in which a person is forced to participate in a sexual act against his or her will, or, for various reasons, is not able to give consent. For discussion here, spousal rape will refer to women who are raped by their husbands, because rape victims are generally women. Discussion will include only heterosexual husband and wife relationships, although it should be noted that lesbian and gay partnerships follow the same patterns of abuse as do heterosexual unions. In such relationships, cases of spousal, or "partner," rape go e<br>  <br>  . . .<br>  ried women have been raped by their husbands. Shiro and Yllo noted that 'when talking about a problem of these dimensions, it is no more fair to say that marital rape is always a savage attack than it is to say that it is always a bedroom squabble. We are talking about a spectrum of which both of these are a part. It is apparent from the above argument, as reasonable as it is, that spousal rape cases would be harder to prosecute than general spouse abuse cases, unless the woman could prove battering. Thus, the feminist definition of rape as always a violent act would not hold up to the scrutiny of a conservative, "well-reasoned" argument. However, to water down the definition of rape as a violent act is to risk dismissing it entirely, as the infancy of spouse abuse reform will attest. While police and community attitudes have improved concerning rapes by strangers, there is still little sympathy, understanding, or support available to a woman victimized by her husband. If a conviction for spousal rape does stick, most likely it will be for battering, which may be the only sign of rape.!!|`|vl0HWTDJaa	I'm not sure which country you're focusing on but in the UK I would:<br>  1) talk about the wife originally being seen as the husband's property so he could do what he wanted<br>  2) look at R v R - which decided for the first time that a husband could rape his wife (but they were separated). As a sidenote - there was a storyline on a soap at around the same time involving a similar situation and public surveys gave the impression that people thought it shouldn't be seen as rape!<br>  3) look at cases where rape was prosecuted even when couple weren't separated<br>  4) compare sentences and conviction rates in these offences compared to general rape<br>  5) look at any other relevant legislation, policies and journals|`|WD6uLJxvaa	I wouldn't. I am confused as to why women act like stingy beotches after they get married, why dont they want to have sex with their husbands?|`|tXrtRFoNaa	find a mosque or a muslim and ask them to define it too you, they don't believe in it. The rest of america does believe that rape is rape married or not.  If the only way to get your spouse to stop is by calling the police, then call the police.  Mike Tyson spent 3 years in prison for raping his wife, so I guess it is a reduced sentence, much like date rape is a lesser crime than just grabbing a woman off of the street and raping her.<br>  Don't know if thats what your looking for but hopefully some of that is useful|`|b9QvIoFDaa	weirdd..
jHUAfrojaa	My boyfriend is a Marine, and trust me girl, you are lucky to have your man only fifteen minutes away from you. My man is currently in Maryland but will be in New Orleans here in a few days. That's an eight hour drive for me. Anyways, it's tough at first. You are going to miss having him with you and all that jazz. You get through it with your love and patience. Realize that when he goes to his station, he might not be able to call you every night. He might be able to web cam the night you really just need to talk to him. Last night was the first time in almost a week I got to web cam with my Marine. That's not bad, considering he isn't deployed. <br>  Did you know he was in the Navy when you started dating him? If so, then you knew what you were getting yourself into when you started the relationship. (I hope that doesn't sound mean.) Just be strong, realize what he is doing is very important to him. If he can't talk that night just say okay I understand and find something to get your mind off of him. When my Marine was in boot camp, I got myself a job, went to summer school, joined a gym, I did anything to get him off my mind. It's hard, no doubt, but I'm pretty sure you can make it. I mean, my boyfriend and I had only been together for a month when he enlisted but I stayed because something deep down in me told me that I had to stay. The love I had for him grew tremendously and even though we went through hell before he was in the Marines, I stood by him. He always tells me the number one thing that stood out about me was that I was willing to wait for him, unlike other girls who were willing to just dip out.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  BTW I wanted to be a nurse too. :)<br>  But I decided being a teacher has always been my calling|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Truthfully, if you just started dating and he is gonna leave soon.<br>  <br>  Then most likely the relationship won't last.<br>  <br>  You won't have time to develop the relationship to the point where it could last, before he leaves.

tcUXitYJaa	unless it has changed you must jump in the pool from 5 ft, tread water for 5 minutes, and then swim 50 yards using any stroke to include dog paddling ( I did!)..i have never heard of anyone having to jump in from the 10ft mark for boot camp. practice before going away to boot camp...when treadin water just keep kicking your legs and you should be fine (just practice with a buddy). then you can dog paddle to the other end, like i said i did. you will get better the more you swim. good luck!|`|EOYzlInRaa	ok so this is what the navy book says<br>  enter water feet first from a 10 foot platform and remain alfoat for 5 min.<br>  <br>  <br>  during in water time swim 50 yards using any stoke or combination of sstrokes..<br>  <br>  >>>>>good luck its not a hard test though|`|i1gesbh5aa	My boyfriend was telling me about this test while he was in.

Do whichever stroke you want, but make sure you can tread water for 5 minutes.|`|9I3wHIdraa	I think the best thing for you is to go practice at the YWCA or some pool.  Just get in and float on your back and move your arms around at your sides.  You will stay afloat as long as you keep air in your lungs.<br>  As you get more confident then jump in from the side of the pool, let yourself sink and while holding your breath you will see that you pop up to the surface.  Get past the fear and you will be OK.

I've never heard of him.  <br>  <br>  Oh, here's a brief bio:<br>  <br>  "Rory Emerald is a serial prankster who's modus operandi is placing fake classified ads claiming to have found bizarre items. Some of the things he's claimed to have found include "Laura Bush's gold cigarette case and lighter, a two-headed kitten, Eva Peron's inauguration gown and diamond scepter, Leonardo da Vinci's original paint brushes and palette, an ice sculpture of SpongeBob SquarePants and a life-size wax figure of Herman Munster."

Kelo went to court, claiming that taking her home and giving it to another private developer to build a commercial business was not "public use",<br>  <br>  New London argued that because the proposed development would generate more taxes than the homes that were there, taking the land was a "public good", and legal. The Supreme Court agreed with the city, and they condemned and took the homes.<br>  <br>  The developer, however, was unable to secure financing. The existing homes - large luxury houses with private docks fronting the river - were all demolished, and what was once a gorgeous high-end neighborhood is now a deserted building site used only by hookers and junkies.<br>  <br>  Richard

Well the hot food part may be but they do not only get one meal.  The other meals might be MREs but they have food.  They also have snacks and other foods available.  You could send some non-perishable food items but there are other things that most would rather have.  Things to do in their off hours.  Books, tapes, DVDs, games, crafts, etc.  Those are really appreciated.  Phone cards are also appreciated.  And just some letters from home.  No politics or current events.  They would rather hear about normal, routine things.  It keeps them grounded and focused on what they are fighting for.  So tell them about a movie you went to see, a new restaurant you visited, how the dog ate the chicken you fixed for dinner, just every day things.<br>  <br>  I think it is great that you want to do that though.<br>  <br>  You can find lists of things you can send but again, be aware that they can buy most items or they have them available.|`|ILgk3OLOaa	Your friend sounds like an idiot.

ruE1llE2aa	You are being very stereotypical of rich people. Most of them have been the people who 'built the boat' or 'built the houses' and they worked very hard to move up in life. Usually when you catch them lying around in their boats, is when they are in the prime of their life. They have earned their fair share (which they worked for) and now they are enjoying it. I believe that is criminal to try to rob them of their years of hard work. Perhaps you should meet some truly sincere wealthy people before being so quick to judge. I would recommend you go to school and get a proper education. Knowledge leads to money. Then you will see if you are still a liberal or not. Did I fail to mention that their was a survey saying that conservative republicans donate the most to charitys and the homeless?|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	I would think that most will pay the taxes and gripe about it.  Take one less vacation a year, keep their mercedes for 2 yrs before they trade it in on the new model, whatever.  I believe they already do hide their money elsewhere, ship their jobs overseas and cut benefits.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	All they can do is hurt themselves in retaliation.|`|e1z8pHfmaa	I love this attitude, it shows a complete misunderstanding of human nature and the perspective of the rich.<br>  <br>  It is like that tired old argument that if you raise taxes their will be no incentive to work.  It's BS and here's why...<br>  <br>  We are all in the same race.  People compete with each other it's our nature.  When your neighbor gets a new toy then we are envious... we want one too.  That is true whether you make $50K or $500K a year.  Where you are confused is in thinking that the guy making $500K is IN ANY WAY comparing his life to the guy making $50K.  He's living in his $2 million house and comparing his life to the guy NEXT DOOR not the guy down on the other side of the tracks.<br>  <br>  He and the guy next door don't look at the same cars or houses or boats as the guy making $50K and he and his neighbor are in the SAME tax bracket.   <br>  <br>  He's still keeping up with the Joneses.... and that requires that he spend some of that money.  The only difference between him and the $50K guy is that no matter what he's still rich.<br>  <br>  No "rich" person is going to just STOP working and spending.  They just won't.  They ALREADY moved their manufacturing overseas (open your eyes) and making money at that point is just a way of keeping score.  They might choose to hold off a while on that house or boat because  the economoy is rough OR they might get a great deal right now and go ahead and buy.<br>  <br>  Conservatism is based ENTIRELY on the fallacy that all citizens can be "rich."  When you stop and think for only the briefest of time.... it should not be hard to figure out why this is not even THEORETICALLY possible.<br>  <br>  Liberalism seeks to set a floor for standard of living FOR ALL.... while Conservatism has been trudging along under a completely FOOLISH philosophy for decades.  Now explain to me how it's the LIBERALS who are shortsighted.... while you stand in the ASHES of an economy brought down by a CONSERVATIVE President.<br>  <br>  P.S.  The Dow today reads as though the Bush Presidency NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.  Any money you made in the market during those years has evaporated.... because it only existed on paper.... paper created by FOOLS who thought that EVERYBODY could be "wealthy" by American standards.

ec6d6526154860f9cab361f34526d848aa	Television grossly distorts the actually daily lives and duties of police officers.<br>  <br>  To be a crime scene investigator, a detective, you have to be a sworn officer requiring you to be academy trained and certified.  But your entry into detectives will not happen until you work a beat for many many years proving you are sharp, hard working, and have a knack for dealing with people.  You might - I mean might - make it to the detective division after that.  But upon entry into detectives, you start over - working less important/lower priority case before you hit the big ones and the big ones get assigned to you by the same ways you earned your way into detectives - hard work, proving yourself and that knack for people thing.<br>  <br>  Now another person you see on those shows is an evidence technician.  The guys who collect evidence.  They may or may not be sworn.  Non sworn do not attend the academy but you have to find an agency that employs them.  Mine has some left over from years past, but we only use sworn now.
f6qmRicQaa	I watched this documentary about sex offenders, and some people who maybe shouldn't be classified as sex offenders.  There was one man who when he was 17 he had sex with his 16 year old girl friend and the parents flipped out and charged him with statutory rape.  He plead guilty and now is considered a registered sex offender.  They interviewed the girl and her parents and they were so sorry for reporting him, the dad said looking back he wished he hadn't.  His life is ruined.  He gets harassed by people who find his name on the list and call him a pedophile and a pervert, because this list doesn't say the circumstances involved.  It's one of those tragic things that result in the toughening of laws for the REAL perverts and pedophiles.  An unfortunate consequence, but the alternative is letting a real perv slip through the cracks.  I think that if a man rapes a woman his name belongs on the list for life.  If any adult sexually abuses a child their name belongs there for life and they should take all the consequences with it.  Even after they serve their time.  As far as I'm concerned I think rapists and child molesters should qualify for the death penalty, period.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Nothing.

This is one area that the UK has it right on!    EDIT: BTW, I am not a Brit...just another American here.|`|441GSyaMaa	I think that that's a bad idea to be honest. I mean then a lot of people won't be able to move onto college/ university (to become doctors, lawyers etc)_ as they'll be in the army and could potentially die. I know that there are a *lot* of jobs in the army, but hey. Plus it would be so expensive for the government... to pay for everyone, all their equipment, housing etc.     Plus we live in a free country and that would go against democracy...    I can see why people think it's a good idea, but it's not like we're going to short of people who want to join the army, or going towards a major war...|`|MNja3iwMaa	Brilliant idea.

Britain has a professional Army who are proud to serve. Force people in and they will rebel causing more problems than soultions.   less unemployment? maybe, but how much will all the new barracks, training, uniforms, vehicles and equipment cost for these guys, and they'll need to be replaced every two years with fresh intakes. it'll cost more than keeping them on the dole!|`|st8xI1Wuaa	Well alot of right wing fascist....stuff is in the making....look at the way freedom of choice... has been taken away already as in  this illegal smoking ban ...so why shouldn`t national service come in .....not as if the people would realise...or notice...look at the way the wets have taken to this act of Nazidom....instead of fighting it...saying no not just to the labour ...mp`s no to whole lot of the ba-tards ....they should publish their names and pictures...so the british people know who not to vote for next time....government of the people my ****|`|fF1WbPltaa	As a male who did do national service, I know it is a good idea. It takes young males off the streets at a time when they are tanked up with testosterone and gives them something else to think about. It could also provide a task force to help the country in so many ways as well as giving the participants a structured lifestyle and a chance to experience things and places they might never otherwise see.    The way some of our young women are acting now, it would be a good idea to include them!    P.S. I am not an BNP supporter.|`|AA11705909	No we do not need NS. It would cost far too much, more than imprisoning youth offenders and the cost of their dole. We are on the lower slopes of a bad recession and cannot afford such luxuries.  I know the hang 'em and flog 'em brigade would love it, but we cannot afford it.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	I hope National Service never returns for it will mean that too many people who are totally unsuited for combat are forced to spend say 2 years in abject misery. Why not offer better rates of pay and conditions and attract the most suitable candidates.|`|nRnokrwKaa	NO I do not believe that national service is a good idea. I think that if I want to serve the country in the army or in any other way for that matter then I should be able to do do it by choice, and not be forced into it.   And as for all these arguments saying 'it makes you a better person', 'its character building', etc, I would debate that to my grave. What is a better person? someone who is organised to the extent of anal retention and can strip an assault rifle in two minutes? Someone who is used and treated as just another cog in the machine of Britain? No, people in modern Britain need social freedom and intellectual development most of all, and national service would provide neither. It may well teach you to love a rag on a pole and an old bint in a palace, but I do not believe that is constructive. People do not need pride in their country, they need pride in themselves! Then they can live their lives in peace and not have the country's social demands put upon them left right and centre!|`|44PoKKMmaa	no it is not a good idea, if they would have continued it then it might work but for two reasons, you pull any old proper wana be gangster off the street and after a week or two shove a sa80 in your hand and say fire what is he going to do, also he could not be forced to take part in activities because "there is no bullying in the arny :P)    second, it would be a disgrace to soldier and people who want to be soldiers, the brothrhoods you form would go away because you do not no if you can trust the person next to you because he does not want to be there    hope this helps|`|inhmBXvfaa	That national service might instill some discipline and respect in young people isn't an altogether terrible argument but there's probably better ways to do it than to train them to kill to people. And thinking about it does learning how to kill people by being shouted at on a daily basis really teach you respect? Respect who? People who shout at you? Certainly not the poor people you're being trained to kill.|`|gDxVZ0pLaa	I think National Service stopped for those born after 1939 and the last National service man had to serve 30 months instead of 24.  I did my national service in 1957 and as far as my parents were concerned it did me a world of good and perhaps it made me a better person due to the experience during the two years.  Would it work in this day and age, I would say NO.  I have to agree with some of the earlier comments we now need professionally trained personnel in this age of modern weapons.Personnel that want to serve the country and not be compulsory drafted into the services.  There is a huge difference between wanting to serve and having to serve.|`|Dx0TitUbaa	I think 'norcot' has it about right.   National Service does not necessarily have to be military, nor does it have to be for 2 years or restricted to males only.   However, I consider military style discipline to be absolutely necessary in order to curb those who would consider themselves to be outside the system.    I believe that society in general would benefit from the instilling of self-discipline into the youth of today.   They could be employed on projects of use to the country;  those who flunked school could be given another chance at basic education;  they would all benefit by learning comradeship and group dependence.

It is a trespass and the owner must get a court order for possession of the premises.  The owner cannot use violence to enter the property or to evict the squatters.  If a squatter is evicted the owner of the property has a legal responsibility to take car of any possessions that the squatter left behind until they can be collected.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Well 1 thing I do know is that if you squat in an empty house for at least 3 years, then legally, the house is yours.

xrRZeROmaa	If the trash was outside the place of business, ready to be picked up by garbage service, then it was no longer the property of the business.  If, however, the trash can inside the business had not yet been dumped into the outside bin, it was still the property of the business, and subject to recall.<br>  <br>  Trash cans and bins outside residences, or businesses, on the public streets or alleys, are subject to search by anyone with the balls to dig.  They are available for anyone to empty into their own container, and go through.  If in the process of searching through the trash,  someone should come across stolen property, and purloin it, It is still considered stolen property, however.  <br>  <br>  In your listed case, I suspect the license was taken from the trash prior to it being emptied into the exterior bin.  I doubt however if you were the culprit, or the arrested party, as you seem to still be employed, and still up to 1000 tricks.<br>  <br>  Thank the Lord, for entertainment value if nothing else.|`|XCn2dK1laa	B/c technically,trash belongs either to the government or to the business.

The problem is that you're supposed to buy your own, and if you used someone else's then the state doesn't get the money.

2lFRYr8Eaa	A blend.  Seems like you have been reading Ayn Rand.   If not, do so.  The two theories are polar opposites.  Egoism is the right of the one to the exclusion of the rest.  Utilitarianism is the right of the masses over the one.|`|Yzcptoagaa	They are similar in that they are consequentialist philosophies concerned with "utility" or benefit.  Otherwise they are opposites.    Ethical egoism is the idea that the only morality is to do what is in one's own best interest.  Utilitarianism (although it has many varieties) is essentially the idea that the correct moral action is the one which results in the greatest good for the greatest number.    Thus, ethical egoism is essentially selfish, whereas utilitarianism is essential altruistic.

However, because people started getting smart and buying more fuel-efficient cars like the Democrats encouraged them to, now they aren't making enough tax revenue (which is a complete BS premise). So they figure not only can they make more money off taxing our miles, but they will be able to track you as well.<br>  <br>  BTW, it was a Republican that proposed this idea.|`|AA11404742	Did you read the article you linked to?

I can say that if you believe a govt database could possibly be any WORSE at protecting patient privacy than the current hodge podge of written records scattered thoughout clinic, diagnostic center, hospital, insurance company, and who knows where else then you need to talk to health care professionals about what the current situation is. The call for reform here didn't happen in a vacuum; the current totally unorganized system neither serves patient privacy nor facilitates better patient care.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	NO!|`|TFdKrkP2aa	They already do.|`|3M6GuYOzaa	that beats having a private firm who will sell them to anyone holding the records.|`|VV7zNqQbaa	As if they don't already?|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	why not, they all ready listen to all my phone calls....|`|19L99wvCaa	They already do, HIPPA laws or not. I'd rather have mine there. It does not mean that anyone can access them without your explicit permission. To do so is a federal crime.|`|AA11593971	Actually, I just heard a lecture by a company that is being consulted on this subject. The back-ups to ensure privacy are amazing. The patient has total control over who can (or can't) see his/her records. The system is totally HIPAA compliant. Digitalizing medical records makes TOTAL sense and will eliminate many dangerous (and costly) medical errors and help increase timeliness of treatment. I am NOT an advocate of universal health care, but this is an issue that I can totally support... and is long overdue.    PS: Check out "Health Vault" ( www.healthvault.com ). It's the model being looked at.|`|AA11041009	Maybe, if they finally allow me to smoke marijuana in peace.|`|97VqHCIRaa	If you think anything is still secret you are kidding yourself.    I'm shocked that records haven't become completely digital yet...|`|3HEsdw3Gaa	No.  But I'd trade that information for reliable payment of my medical bills any day.  My insurance company is unreliable and always tries to deny claims if they can find an excuse.    There is already a central registry for all medical insurance claims and information about any medical conditions you might have is maintained and shared by the insurance companies through the Medical Information Bureau.  The IRS can require you to provide receipts for any deductions you claim and Medicare is closely supervised by teh government.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	No I really don't.  I'm not really sure why other than I don't want someone telling me that it is mandatory to turn over something that belongs to me to the government.  Next thing we will all have a micro chip implanted (like Hilliary wanted to do) and the control will be ultimate.  No, I think I will keep my medical records to myself and continue to pay for my own health care.  I don't foresee that anything the government takes control of being a good thing.  They pretty much stink at everything they do.  Trust me on this...I will opt out  until they have to physically force me.|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	All I want from the government is to pay me back what they took in S.S. and payroll taxes and then LEAVE ME ALONE.    I would rather pitch a tent in the woods than contribute anymore to corruption and the high & mighty lifestyles of the rich, famous and politicians.    Why can't they just give us a level playing field?  I don't mean black, white, Christian, Muslim, gay, straight.  Just leave us all alone and we can work our problems out without all the indebtedness and corruption.  Most of us just want to mind our own business, not hurt or judge others, protect our families, etc.  We do not hate or judge.  We accept our neighbors and friends as long as they are not impacting our lives and this is where the government errs:  the pit us all against each other and stir up dissention where none exists.|`|fEnKOqJvaa	no. the answer is no. becuases is lossing are righ as a  civilian also you can have them in court and get big money from the hospital and doctor becuases by law no one can't get you record with out legal documents. if the usa administration do somenthing like this. it will be momey in you're hands it is a law agains that, and it was past from the pentagon years ago. they can't ternd the tables when some one elses did.it call doble jepardy)

Theres straving children in africa she'd say.  Be grateful you live in this country.  I was raised patriotic and with a love for this country.  It makes me sick to see whats happening.  I've been around long enough to know something just isn't right.  I've never felt arragant or have seen the need to apoligize for this country.  How dare obama say that.|`|kjTEbi8yaa	I could care less about the U.S being popular or liked I want us to be respected and feared!     And Yes we are a weaker nation since Obama took office.|`|JgVYkiQLaa	Why do so many cons want to be feared?    I think it's stronger now because more people like us than when Bush and his criminal band were in power.|`|NcWDp30Baa	Yes we are weaker and looking worse every time Obama opens his mouth !  If the liberals think people like us better because of Obama they are naive !  they don't like us any better they just like the fact we have someone more like them running the country, you know misery loves company !|`|GIBCLSuYaa	well if liked and strong is not an option I'll take feared and strong. better than weak and fearful.|`|4bb9634fc5a91b36fafd38e3fba80eecaa	must be having a, into me world day again,  throw your fear some other direction ,  oh little one|`|3GXYel3Kaa	I am sorry to be critical of what could be an interesting question, but you have really poorly conceptualized and phrased it.  What constitutes weaker/stronger in real terms?  You are essentially equating fear with strength and liked with weakness.  Neither is true.    Liked and strong moreover has never been true of the United States or any other power in the past.  Like so much else in history, it is a matter of degree. It's not a simplistic either/or situation.     Perhaps you want to think about rephrasing the question.    Cheers.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	No we are stronger.    How is that feared and strong neocon BS working for you - 8 years, trillions of dollars and negative results later?    Sooner or later, even shills must face facts: the Bush neocon years were a complete failure.  And a costly failure at that.|`|ABCuhBwFaa	Yes. No question.    Perception is everything. Clearly Obama's policies and rhetoric has embolden all the bullies on the block. China all of a sudden is pushing the envelope with military expansion and veiled "financial" threats. Russia has amped up their rhetoric and Iran has laughed at Obama's overtures with grand displays of their nuclear progress.    Obama's worshipful bow to the Islamic monarch was like a dinner bell before the beasts. Not only did it betray his unbelieveable naivete, but it also connotes his weakness and indifference toward his nationality.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	No doubt we appear weaker. Russia has breathed a sigh of relief because of the dead F22 program. And North Korea is still laughing at us because we didn't blow their missile out of the sky.      Right Toms, they have really stepped up with troops in Afghanistan, NOT.      SFC  US Army  Retired|`|GWz5KDTwaa	I hope we are weaker.  I want the defense budget cut by at least half.  We need the money for Universal Health Care.  Plus, with a smaller military we will be less likely to enter into stupid wasteful wars like Iraq.  Being "weaker" will lead to us being less arrogant and the by-product of that will be that we will be liked.|`|AA11963685	No, we are not weaker.  We are stronger for having reached out to repair the damage that was done in the last eight years.  There are few things that point to strength like a person willing to admit mistakes and vowing to correct those mistakes.  That shows strength of character, and his strength in doing this reflects on all of us.  Sorry, I don't agree with you that "liked and strong" cannot co-exist.  The only days that are over are the days of being completely hated, by even our Allies.  They aren't completely won over yet but now they are willing to forgive if we mend our ways and act like the responsible world leader we used to be.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Yes, weaker and soon going to get even more so. It's all part of the setup for that traitor Obama to hand us over to the new world order without us firing a shot.|`|aXSjRwEVaa	Being liked makes us stronger (allies are more willing to lend a helping hand).|`|7EkeIcw4aa	Take a look at the Somalia pirates/terrorists. More than likely they will get their 2 million dollars from the taxpayers.

Weak:  Seems people fear al quaeda and the taliban more than they do the United States.  feared?  only because of nuclear weapons  liked?  by some, but not many.    and we had a president whio clapsed the hand of the same king~~and led him into the white house as if to engage in a game of playstation,   rather than to discuss the Saudi influence ~~ or Supposed influence~ in 911.  People have a right to bow to whomever they want. Queen Elizabeth is a Queen, and yet to me, she is just another woman who lives off of the backs of her people.|`|Lq4306a5aa	Strong countries tend to form solid alliances with other strong and loyal countries.    K, here's what you do.  Go to the library and look up WWII and see "Allied Forces".    In fact, look up every war we won and lost and count the number of allies we had.  Pretty clear.|`|Dpzk9w0Naa	No, I'm currently living in Mexico, and I can tell you for sure we are respected more now than a year ago.|`|QCEHA6d6aa	As fare as I know their are still countries that dislike the United States even after President Obama left his seed. And as for the United States being strong well that would depend on how other countries perceive our nation. As fare as I know Iran and North Korea look at the United States as a joke even after President Obama tried diplomacy.
K71Qoakwaa	I think he will.<br>  <br>  1)  They don't work<br>  2) They cost too much<br>  3) It would repair relations with Russia and stop them from causing trouble in retaliation.|`|b97IpZBOaa	Russia sees Obama as very weak.<br>  China sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Cuba sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Iran sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Iraq sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Pakistan sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Haiti sees Obama as very weak.<br>  France sees Obama as very weak.<br>  England sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Spain sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Mexico sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Columbia sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Venezuela sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Greece sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Israel sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Germany sees Obama as very weak.<br>  Dubai sees Obama as very weak.|`|AA11210239	There is nothing smart about doing that.

AA10482044	Kind of glad not to be in the only country throwing away its freedoms; people devoid of any courage don't deserve any freedom so it's alright for him.  For everyone else we have a camera on every corner now on every poor side of town in the UK and it makes little difference except that you never see a copper again, the people you worry about wear hoodies, really dangerous people look exactly the same as everyone else making the next 'cause' facial recognition systems all linked.  Can't be long now before we have to submit a daily itinerary, wear a helmet to walk in case we fall over and accept cameras in our homes w. the knowledge that someone is always watching..|`|0nZHAaQDaa	No its  out of 1984 ! Daley is Obama's godfather by the way|`|3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	We already have surveillance cameras on most street corners here.  However, if they are turned on, there is no one watching them.  They are supposed to take pictures of cars speeding through the intersections and issue traffic tickets automatically and send them to drivers through the mail, but I've never heard of that happening to anyone.  That's why I think they're turned off or not being watched.  Daley is dreaming anyway if he thinks he can stop crime.  You can use technology all you want in an attempt to increase safety, but it won't stop crime.  Criminals will get more sophisticated.  As socialism continues to infiltrate our country unemployment will rise and some people will become so desperate that they will commit crimes whether the cameras are watching or not.  I suppose they can still use the technology to catch the offenders, but the dead people are still going to be dead and the streets will still be unsafe.  Cameras don't work, period.  Surveillance cameras don't stop people from holding up gas stations and convenience stores, and they don't stop people from running red lights either.  But I suppose they will create more jobs, because we need people to watch the videotapes.  They can create a Surveillance Tape Viewer Union too.  See, there's a silver lining in every cloud.|`|vRY2vExRaa	He's not advocating putting them in homes.

8A0JdS7Xaa	Phased out. We went from the really comfortable OD cotton fatigues to the less comfortable permanent around '78-'79 and they made the subdued insignia mandatory shortly after. I got my first woodland BDUs in 1987 and they were pretty much mandatory by 1990. Chocolate chip DCUs for DESERT SHIELD and then the three color DCUs for certain deployments over the next decade. The abominable ABUs came after I retired in '02. And if it were up to me, everyone with an office job would wear blues, all mechanics would wear OD fatigues, and only people who spent more than 60% of their time off of paved surfaces would wear any sort of "combat" uniform.    And has anybody noticed that from 100 yards the ABUs look just like a badly faded set of green fatigues?|`|AA11163314	They were replaced by uniforms that last longer, are easier to clean and maintain, are more comfortable to wear and provide improved fire resistance.|`|QdzecSwdaa	They were replaced by just the opposite m1a1.........the new Uniforms SUCK, they are hot, heavy, and an idiotic design.  The USAF has new uniforms, call ABU's, and I am still wearing the old BDU's because the new one are horrible. Even in theater I refuse to wear them, DCU's are way more practical and more comforitable|`|p6viL2Bmaa	My dad is a Vietnam Vet and asks the same question about fatigues.  The military moved on to better, more durable uniforms over the years.  Now we all have our own digital camo uniforms.  And as Tom pointed out, the new Air Force ABUs aren't all that great.  They are cheap to maintain, wash and wear.  But they are way too thick.  Especially when deployed to the desert.  But I still rather them over the BDU.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	They got phased out in the early '90's to be replaced by the BDU.  Dad had the old green fatigues, and even the older yet tan ones!  Meanwhile, hubby is on uniform type  3 in his career.  Hopefully this will be the last one!

Calling a black man a "monkey" has been more or less a racial epitaph since the days of slavery. There's a big difference in referring to George Bush as one and referring to Pres. Obama as one.<br>  <br>  Also, the fact that the monkey in the cartoon was gunned down makes light of the fact that Obama is and forever will be a target for assassination by a certain segment of American society and that's not a topic that should be made to be "funny." In fact, the cartoon almost seems to encourage the aforementioned violent act.<br>  <br>  As far as Holder's "coward" comment, I think that the election of Barack Obama by large numbers of whites shows that he's out of touch with current times. He's still thinking with 1960's mentality.|`|iVU7beMuaa	Wouldn't it be great if he stood up to these intimidation tactics?|`|GOpDGnsXaa	The Post shouldn't have apologized that disgusts me.<br>  Just because people are ignorant and don't understand why should a paper apologizes for ignorant readers.<br>  F U C K this socialism|`|W0VL46gDaa	see, I heard the coward remark before I heard about the cartoon..<br>  <br>  So the first thing I thought when I heard Holder's comment was, oh great- people are going to be making a huge "racist" issue out of this.<br>  <br>  And when I saw the cartoon I was wondered, why this was made into such a big deal.... I actually thought, at first, that it was supposed to be towards Bush (since he was portrayed as a chimp for so long) It never made me think Obama or Racist at all.<br>  <br>  I dont think they should have been forced to appologize- people need to remember the ole saying "Sticks and Stones"|`|SlhuFfuZaa	This administration is a contrast of terms and doctrine. A thing is stated one way today and the complete opposite the next. What is illegal yesterday is legal today. This is the confusion factor by which they will keep any who are not up to date from minute to minute in a state of limbo. By doing this when they begin collecting souls for their collective communities few will realize they are sending them to an internment camp as prisoners of the Obamanation, which is an abomination in, not only our eyes but apparently, the eyes of real socialists.<br>  Holder is just another racists idiot who needs to be tarred and feathered.

2zGSdDvIaa	Economic problems, as I understand them.<br>  <br>  1.  Mortages.  Home mortages kept going up and up to the point where middle class america could no longer afford to buy homes in traditionall middle class neighborhoods.  This created a large housing bubble.<br>  2.  Banks were forced by govt to give low interest loans to people with iffy credit ratings.<br>  3.  Auto unions and other unions have been pushing thier industries very hard for very good compensation packages.  thus these companies raised the price of their products and began farming the labor out over seas.<br>  4.  Govt spent more than they were taking in for too long.  Even with record govt income thanks to lower taxes, the congress spent money (republicans as well as Democrats) like there was no tomorrow.<br>  <br>  All of the above put together with many other factors of greater and lesser degree combined for a perfect storm.<br>  <br>  Now, the housing market is collapsing.  Starting with middle class america not being able to afford  middle class neighborhoods then the prices started to drop the bubble burst and price drops accelerate.  People wait to buy homes because prices are dfropping and they want better deals.  Then the home you are in no longer has positive net worth (you owe more than you can sell for) and you can no longer move.  those who have to move sell at larger and larger losses.<br>  <br>  People with bad creidt default on loans.  the banks take those homes over and sell below market price.  This in turn drives market prices even farther.  Realestate market goes to he#!.  <br>  <br>  Investment balances in real estate, a primary source of real value for banks and major corps goes away.  <br>  <br>  Taxes continue to increase.  People have less buying power.  With less buying power more companies are forced to lay people off.  Less people at work, more on un-employement, more bankrupcies, more laon defaults, more govt debt......<br>  <br>  Its a nasty cascade that seems to be accelerating.  With luck it will stabilize soon.<br>  <br>  The stated intent of the stimulus plan is to pump cash into the economy and create new jobs.  If all goes well you stop the decending cascade and start the economy back up again.  Although this has been do regularly with the govt. it rarely works as they want it to.<br>  <br>  <br>  Does this help?|`|C5AhlEY5aa	To much corp. greed.

Now if that is true, what the heck are these darn stimulus bills all about anyway?  I'm not saying this will right it self again, but that would mean in about 5-6 months, we should have started to see a turnaround "on it's own" without the government butting in and taking charge of it all, and putting ALL OF US in debt for years and years to come.

Another problem is that we deregulated banks and financial institutions and allowed them to lose literally trillions in bad loans, which are guaranteed by the govt. so they must be covered by the taxpayers.  <br>  <br>  Consumer confidence is way down, meaning that people aren't spending money because they're not sure they'll have their jobs for long and they're worried about losing their houses.  Consumers not spending money means that companies can't keep making stuff so they have to lay off employees.  Which raises unemployment and contributes to lower consumer confidence.<br>  <br>  Basically the Republicans want to fix this with tax cuts.  But it was tax cuts that got us into this trouble.  The Republicans think more tax cuts are going to get us out.  They also gave big amounts of money to the banks, but with no conditions on what to do with it, so lots of bankers just gave themselves bonuses and went off on big expensive vacations.<br>  <br>  The Democrats want to fix it with government 'investment' in things that return more than we invest.  Things we need anyway like infrastructure maintenance (roads and bridges), building schools, etc.<br>  <br>  It's very hard to get good, straight information because everyone is biased towards one party or the other. This is a time of very strong partisanship.  So Republicans will criticize -anything- Obama does and will try to obstruct the Democrats' plans.

He and his cronies should have been reading Adam Smith instead of Marx. If they had, they'd know that a free-market economy has a way of healing itself. Of course, they have to look like they're "doing something," so they'll throw some stuff at the wall and watch it slide impotently down.    And it will come at a crushing expense to all of us.    They will discourage free enterprise and punish entrepreneurship, whether they mean to or not.    They will quash our 1st Amendment rights in the name of "fairness."    They will do their best to reverse the marginal gains we've made with the 2nd Amendment over the last few years.    They will endanger our sovereignty by insisting on open borders and negotiations with tyrannical regimes. They will falter when force is required, whether it be military or diplomatic. They will make us appear weak in the eyes of the world, and they will kowtow to the United Nations, an organization that serves no irreplaceable purpose on the world stage.    They will do their best to pack the Supreme Court with "progressive" justices. In case you don't know, "progressive" means that concepts like individual rights and habeas corpus are anachronisms.

You know what? it's not the BNP I can tell you that, compared with the mainstream bunch of fraudulent Dagons (leaders/a god of the philistines) the BNP are very placid. The reason for the rise of the BNP is not the out right open corruption and fraudulent activities of both our houses of government but a simple logical conception ie they are listening to the British people and want the same thing we do and that is to survive. The BNP is trying where the closed Dictatorship ( there is no difference in political ideology so to vote for any of the mainstream parties you vote for the same) has closed its ranks to the thoughts of the people. The last time this happened it was Parliament against the king in 1642, now its Parliament against the people that is a dangerous explosive mixture especially when the people have had enough.

The negation of the Holocausto is centered in a tie irrational hatred with the anti-semitism. Those that denies the Holocausto ignore the numerous tests that guarantee their existence and insist on which it is a myth invented by the allies, the Soviet Communists and the Jews to achieve own objectives. According to the “logic” of they deny which it, the allies needed the “myth the Holocausto” to justify their occupation of Germany in 1945 and “implacable” the persecution of the Nazi defendant. In addition they insist on which the Jews needed the “myth the Holocausto” to obtain generous payments of Germany for indemnification and to justify the creation of the state of Israel. They insist, then, in the existence of a great conspiracy that involves the winning powers of World War II, to the Jews and Israel, and whose aim is to spread the Holocausto after own aims. <br>  One of its strategies is to affirm in simplistic form that if can discredit a fact of the Holocausto, all their history also can be discredited. They most of close the eyes to the tests of this historical event and they are concentrated in three specific arguments that, according to them, refute the reality of the Holocausto in their totality. First of all, they argue that since there is no not one document that describes to the Holocausto or with the company/signature of Hitler ordering its execution, everything is a deceit. In order to endorse this argument, they reject all the tests that appeared in Nuremberg. They denounce that the genocida intention of the Nazi state and the thousands of orders, memorandos, notes and other registries that document the process of the destruction are an invention. As they cannot endorse its arguments of which the documents are apocryphal, they affirm that its content was misinterpreted in deliberate form. In addition, they insist on which the allies used tortures in order to obtain the confessions of the responsibility of the slaughters and that the witnesses of committed Nazi crimes against the Jews lay motivated by personal interests. Secondly, those that deny the Holocausto insist on which “the few” Jews who perished died of natural causes or that state executed the Nazi them in legitimate form by real crimes. They affirm that the Jews and the allied powers exaggerated the amount of Jews assassinated during the war. Practically all the historians agree in which in the Holocausto they assassinated themselves between 5.1 and 6 million Jews. Whenever erudite legitimate historical sources and trustworthy demographic methods try to need this amount using, those that deny the Holocausto say that vagueness in the exact number of deaths within that rank unanimously accepted constitutes a test that all the history of the Holocausto was an invention and indicate that the amount of deaths of Jews during World War II has been exaggerated. Finally, they assure that the Nazis did not use gas chambers to kill the Jews and deny the existence of the extermination fields. They focus his attention on Auschwitz and they think that if could deny the idea that the Nazis used gas chambers in Auschwitz to kill the Jews, it would be sufficient to also discredit all the history of the Holocausto. They want that the historical event is reason for debate. By mainly, they aspire to being considered legitimate carriers of a solid historical argument erudite. They long for a public space to show what they call “the other side of the question”. The Americans who deny the Holocausto frequently imitate the forms and the practices of the scholars, in order to be able to disguise in front of the public the nature of their opinions. Often they claim to be specialistic in the Holocausto, but their credentials are examined, are specialistic, if they are it, in other fields nonrelated to the subject. Arthur Butz, a American who denied the Holocausto, was professor of engineering in the University of the Northwest (Northwestern University). Fred Leuchter, also American, declared to be specialistic in the construction of gas chambers for executions, but a British court determined that such affirmation did not have foundation. Those that denies the Holocausto generally place footnotes in their writings to mention the publications of which they think like them. They are in force by pseudoacademic conventions. The Institute of Historical Revision of California (for Institute Historical Review in California), center of the movement of negation of the Holocausto in the United States, published recently until an pseudoacademic newspaper with articles written by important figures of this movement: Arthur Butz (EE. UU.),
48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Your premise is incorrect.  It is not lawful to drive in violation of the speed limit just because everybody else is doing so.  It is true that when the speed limit is below the maximum limit (usually 55 or 65) the fact that everybody was going at a particular speed may be evidence that the speed was "reasonable and prudent" (the "basic speed law')and thus not in violation of the law, but that does not mean that a speed which is NOT "reasonable and prudent" is lawful just because everybody is driving dangerously.  A speed in excess of the maximum speed limit is always illegal, no matter what anybody else is doing.    So, it is not lawful to speed, and it is not lawful to cross the double yellow line.

9myfqAyRaa	Since we are speaking of Rush, you are correct. I look at a person such as him as the enemy of the average American. They place themselves on this holier and better than thou pedestal just asking to be knocked down by their own personal doings. They preach one thing and do something completely different. It's all about money for these people. They do not care about the philosophy they espouse, they say the things they do because it makes them popular with republicans and the more popular an instigator like Rush is, the more he can command in the area of legal tender. After all, isn't that what people like him really care about?    The republican party just refuses to change their course. They are indeed well aware of their situation, neither Bush or Cheney attended their own national convention and I'm sure it was a mutual agreement on both sides not to attend. They just refuse to take any accountability or responsibility for supporting the Bush/Cheney administration for eight years. It's like what they did, didn't happen, the democrats taking control of congress is what caused our mess.    Unless republicans change their tone and stance, they are dooming themselves to being the minority party. To be completely honest, they are starting to sound downright American. Calling their fellow congress members socialists. They know the damage they are calling upon themselves from the rest of the country but once again, they refuse to take any responsibility.

Rush is an entertainer - and the fact that a talkshow host is virtually the ONLY voice espousing conservative values is the true tragedy of the GOP.      Conservatives are very ANGERY at the flaccid spineless tax raising RINOs like Schwarzenegger & Lib Dem @ss kissers like McCain.    Then we have morons like David Frum who thinks the reason Conservatives are letting Republicans take a beating in the polls, is because Republicans just haven't kissed ENOUGH Lib Dem @ss.    Understand?  Republicans can win if they actually RUN  a Reagan or Buckley.  To win the last election Democrats literally had to collapse the economy & change the election rules.       Letting Independents vote in Republican Primaries prevented the election of a remotely conservative candidate.  Changing the election rules gave Republicans the painfully moderate McCain.   Who the Dems felt they could beat.  McCain was literally chosen for his ability to lose.    Of course McCain didn't know this,  so when his VP choice of Conservative Palin started to turn his poll numbers around, the Dems had to trigger an economic collapse to win.  (How convenient that everything went magically to hell in October)     I'm a Californian who's always voted Republican.  But quite frankly I wouldn't vote for Schwarzenegger again if he were running against the reincarnation of Karl Marx.    I am a Regan/Buckley/Rand/Rush conservative NOT a Republican.  And if the GOP thinks it hasn't gone Left enough - Goodbye & Good Riddance.    Of course that said, McCain was more a Democrat trick than a Republican choice & Arnold S, was a Hollywood Actor married to a Lib Dem, so no giant surprise he turned out spineless.    Also the 'Myth' that the GOP just hasn't gone left enough, always seems to come from those who hate the party to begin with....      ....don't they all just sparkle when some right wing fool agrees with them.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	Frum makes two critical errors in his thinking.  First, he focuses on Obama's veneer, his appearances.  This is truly the primary divide between the left and the right when it comes to Obama.  The left focuses on the image the media have painted of him being this cool and flawless leader.  It's important that this image would not be even close to possible without substantial media support.  Not only do they give the guy passes, they viciously attack anyone who even questions him.  They rarely discuss the man's policies or even his philosophies outside this general set of near- meaningless platitudes that he gives in speeches, but are sharply different from his actions.  The right, meanwhile, focuses on what policies Obama has and will enact.  Actions speak louder then words for them.    The other mistake is the feeling that Limbaugh is the leader of the Reps.  He's not; Michael Steele is.  Limbaugh is an outside commentator who specializes in pointing out the inconsistencies, the lies, and the hypocrisy of both the Dems and the MSM.  Naturally, the media have painted an ugly picture of the man.  How much is deserved, I don't know.  I've never met the guy, but it's fairly obvious that there's a substantial double standard.  Which, given his skewering of the MSM, isn't surprising.

He put weed on the lowest possible importance list. Every year here we have hemp fest and people walk around and smoke joints and whatnot and the cops leave people alone. In the state of washington there is a bill in each house that would decriminalize possession of 40 grams or less to a simple infraction.

So now, the second half is supposed to go towards rewriting loans to hopefully stem the tide of foreclosures.  Will it work?  I have no idea, but I do think that it stands a better chance of solving the local community problems than the first half did by going towards retreats, CEO bonuses and dividends.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	they got to repay ACORN and welfare folks who wnat to buy what they cant afford, Obama rewards the irresponsible at the expense of the responsible|`|e19ukSO0aa	Because it would cost the country MORE money in the long run if we didn't do anything at all.<br>  <br>  Sucks, but that's the way it is.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	The 9 million families being helped are not getting anything for free, as you are implying.  The money will be spent to help the lending institutions modify the mortgages - which is very much like a refinancing.  I assume that the money will be spent on closing costs so that the bank won't lose money and the mortgagors will not have to come up with a lot of up-front money (which would be impossible for people who have lost their jobs and can't find new jobs which pay enough to make the pmts.)  The modifications will lower the interest rate and lengthen the life of the loan.<br>  <br>  If you take out a half million dollar mortgage, you will have to qualify for it - as I assume you can - and make regular payments, just like the people who are receiving govt-funded refinance deals.<br>  <br>  One justification for the aid is that if homes are saved from foreclosure, then the value of the neighboring properties will not diminish.  In other words, if a few of your tax dollars helps some of your neighbors stay in their homes, then your property will not lose its value.  So, the mortgage stimulus will help another 100 million people, or more, to keep their property values from sinking.<br>  <br>  Hey, if you really want to take out a home equity loan, now is the time to do it.

yvPA8FSsaa	Your premise is flawed.  No one bailed "wall street" out.  The Bail out was for investment banks that were ruined due to bad loans that they were forced to make by the Federal Government.  They were not in trouble due to their own greed.  That is the Liberal spin.<br>  <br>  What bank would willingly lend its money to a person who was not qualified?  Even the "greedy" argument makes no sense.  If one mortgage in ten defaults, it seriously impacts the lenders profitability.  No bankers, especially greedy ones,  want to lend money to someone who may default.  Obviously, they were forced to by Democrat Policy started under Jimmy Carter, again, with good intention.  But as is always the case with Liberal programs based on good intention, they normally end up doing more harm than good.<br>  <br>  If Wall Street collapses, there goes everyone's pension, most States funds, most Cities funds and most every job in the country.  When politicians speak it can cost you money.  When Wall Street speaks, I suggest you listen.<br>  <br>  The point the man was making was that the Government has no money.  Whatever money they give to save someone's house they first have to take from someone else.  His question is, if they are going to bail out people you bought more house than they could afford and got behind on their payments, why should those of us homeowners how are current have to pay or why should renters who don't even own a house have to pay for their mistake?<br>  <br>  If you pay rent, do you think I should be able to take some of your money to help me pay my mortgage?  That is what the government is doing and that is just plain wrong.  <br>  <br>  *|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	Nor should we save people who borrowed more than they could afford for larger homes than they could affort with nothing down and then penalize those who are sacrificing by investing with down payments, paying average homes in average neighborhoods, paying their mortgages, the home owners insurance and home owner taxes.<br>  <br>  I could sure use the money the government will take from me to make some repairs on my home and just to fix it up since I've been paying for it on time for over 10 years.

I think that many folks are losing perspective on the whole thing.  Please try to keep in mind that there's no provision in the stimulus that's paying off people's homes and giving them a free ride.  They're still going to have to pay.  I wouldn't think it was necessarily a bad thing to help homeowners stuck in bad loans for homes that are now worth much less than they paid for them... if I thought it would save them.  The problem is that many of them can't afford the homes even at their adjusted value with a near zero fixed interest rate.  Of course, buying them out of their debt altogether is a horrible idea, as they would learn nothing and probably still end up in financial trouble down the road.  Forcing the re-negotiation of the terms and value of their loans isn't going to do any better for many, IMO.  They're still going to be living in more house than they can afford.  At some point, they'll fall behind again and the loans will go into default anyway.  Of course, some will be saved and that's not so bad.  Most people, individuals and businesses alike, don't learn from their poor decisions.  I think that something needs to be done to help our economy.... I'm just not convinced that what we're doing will work.  I'm also thankful that I've paid for my home and don't have a mortgage.  I'll take my situation over those being bailed out any day.

w0eRRsoVaa	It depends on what he tries to do.  Some states are passing laws requiring technology that doesn't even exist yet to be used when the reality is that people who really want to kill someone, will kill them using a weapon that comes in from a different state or country.  I believe most States, if not all, have a ban on full auto weapons, and different types of ammunition, but again, people smuggle those into this country from just about everywhere.      Micro-stamped bullet casings are pointless if the person police's their brass thus, nothing is gained from it.  He can't take the rights away thanks to the Supreme Court ruling, just as much as no one can take away abortion rights because of the Supreme Court ruling.  Gun laws are done more at the state level than at the national level.  We'll just have to wait and see what he tries to do and hope he listens to those of us law-abiding citizens who hunt and choose to protect ourselves and our families.|`|1JeO54hzaa	The President doesn't have as much control over such issue as Gun Control and Abortion. Congress receives much funding from the NRA and as such are very unlikely to go against them - indeed i believe they are the highest spending pressure group towards Congress.    Furthermore it is up to the Supreme Court Rulings to decide on issues such as this that concern the constitution. As the supreme court is mainly consisRepublicanebulican (if not now, then they were in nomination) judges, and as such are more likely to swap toward their right-wing ideology on such strong issues as this. If one keeps in mind that Obama could be in effect chosing the next 2 or possibly 3 successors to the Supreme Court, then one could see the Court swing to the Left. This however will not be a sudden change, it would probably require a second term from Obama.|`|52cGZS3caa	I don't think the President will personally affect the current gun laws. The Congress is the body that has the say so for that. I would like to see a ban on automatic, high powered weaponry (the kind only the military and police should have) and "cop-killer" ammunition, but I don't even see that in the future as the Congress is pretty much under the finger of the NRA gun lobby.
fSlZQzS4aa	Stimulooting is not something allowed by the Constitiution.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	N o, the Constitution limits the power of gov't for a reason.  Which is why Obama wants to amend it.  He wants a dictatorship.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	The Constitution neither explicitly allows it nor implies it. The Constitution specifically limits the the power of the federal government and then says that all other powers go to the People or the States. Most of the stuff the government does now is specifically unconstitutional and illegal. This is why we need a new revolution to put them back in their place.<br>  <br>  Unicorn: Assuming everything the government does is constitutional just because it's the government doing it is just plain stupid.|`|a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa	No, but constitutional authority is something no one on the Hill has been bothered by for over 40 years.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	No. I don't even think anybody in Congress has read the Constitution|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Apparently...yes.|`|cJPtKAU3aa	Nothing in the Constitution talks about stimulATING the economy.

If single mothers don't get money, their children will suffer.|`|Fy54FMemaa	Apparently the people making statements like this have been lucky enough to avoid layoffs and all round bad luck. Why do you have to generalize a group?<br>  <br>  A couple buys a house based on thier income. They both make good money, own shares in stock and have 401K's. Mom gets sick and cant work, dad needs to support the family and bills. He picks up a 2nd job to offset the difference, recession sets in, his 2nd job makes cuts and last one hired, first one fired. Mom's perscriptions are not all covered by insurance... kids are still growing, need new clothes, shoes etc... not to mention they enjoy eating. Dad tries to get extra hours at his primary job, guess what, recession not only restricts that from happening but actually cuts back on the hours he already has.... is he panicing yet? No, not yet... he has a plan, he will keep looking for another job to compensate the losses... is he having luck.. no. He cash's in a 401K for some cash (forget their stocks, thats long gone). The elect bill comes in, he makes partial payments on it just so the lights stay on, gas bill comes in, he basically does the same thing... morgage bill is up, he gathers all his p's and q's to make that note... he just barely made it. What happens if he loses his job all together? What happens to this man next month? He is doing the best he can, he is not lazy, he loves his family but the forces are working against him right now.<br>  <br>  This is the reality of our country right now. This is NOT to say there are not lazy people out there because there are, however, we cannot generalize people as a whole based on their parts. <br>  <br>  **** Not everyone who needs help got themselves in trouble because they bought things that in the long run they couldn't afford, many people fell on some hard times, these things happen.... by looking at the greedy answers left by some. I'd like to know, how many of these people go to church and put money in the collection plate, or put change in the salvation army bucket during Christmas... or any other charitable organization... guess what, that money goes to the less fortunate! So if you think that people shouldn't get handouts because they are lazy, I guess your greedy selves will be holding onto your money when the opportunity to help out crosses your path.|`|a4XA69uGaa	yeah I know what you mean, like paying for those bankers to have an exclusive hunting trip in Britain at a very expensive resort, when they were begging for money and saying they didn't have any. <br>  <br>  Then we go in and bail them out!|`|ciQFlpuLaa	they want those irresponsible people to have more kids, so in the future, the Democrats will have more supporters!|`|VSmQWuhEaa	It breeds dependence, which becomes a permanent base of political support.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	It has been both parties.

That's rich.... just like a conservative to keep redefining liberalism as "everything bad that has EVER happened."  It takes a stunning amount of ignorance to make such a comment.... Obama has been in office ONE MONTH today.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:   As if to prove my point as to the conservatives blaming liberalism for EVERYTHING.... someone who failed Roman history blames LIBERALS for the fall of the Roman Empire.  <br>  <br>  How one can be ignorant enough of history to come to this conclusion simply shows that we should put MORE funding into schools not less.  Then again since the ignorant ARE the base of the Republican party maybe there is a reason Republicans don't want new schools or to assist our young in educating themselves.  <br>  <br>  Genius.... there WAS NOTHING liberal about Roman society except perhaps their attitude toward sex.... and the Empire fell due to attacks from outside of the Empire and a dispute over power which led to it's split into East and West.... now back to class.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Because we are in an era of new responsibility....NEW RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY RESPONSIBLE!!!!

A mandatory belief is unconstitutional. Despite my view on that i do believe that prayer SHOULDN'T be banned in schools. I believe that the FCA is a good program for kids to get involved in religion at school in there own way and they usually make it fun for the kids so they will want to show up and have fun with other people who have the same beliefs as them.

Who is going to compose and deliver the prayers? Whose God is going to be prayed to? As President Obama noted in his inaugural address, the U.S. is a nation of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists (along with dozens of smaller groups), and the non-religious. Would members of minority religions be compelled to participate in Christian prayers? Would everybody get a turn, so that sometimes Christians would have to kneel facing Mecca and praise Allah? From a practical point of view, it would never work. One of the very, very best ideas the Founding Fathers had was the separation of church and state. They recognized that entanglement between the two was bad for both of them. That was true in the 1700s when nearly everyone was some variety of Christian, and it is vastly more true today when the gamut of religious beliefs is much wider.|`|ss3QPHKIaa	Absolutely not.

iVU7beMuaa	As has been said before, and will be said again, Obama didn't write this bill.  Pelosi and Reed are the authors.  <br>    <br>    But had it been about him so much the better.  This is politics, and characterizing a politician as a monkey is anything but new.  If a president and congress want to go bananas spending our money they should expect to be called out for their monkey business.  <br>  <br>    Calling someone a monkey can be racist, but not every comparison to a monkey (especially in politics) is a "racist rant."  It is revealing, however, to see how quickly some people will "connect the dots" and find racism (e.i. monkey + stimulus bill must = Obama).  Part of ending racism now is taking things in context and not always seeing racism at first glance.|`|k5WdChc7aa	Did you read the cartoon?<br>  <br>  "Looks like they'll have to find someone else to WRITE the next stimulus bill".<br>  <br>  Since when does the President write bills? I'm pretty sure he doesn't - he signs them. Do you even understand the political system of our government and how bills become laws? Because if you did, you wouldn't think this cartoon was racist either.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, it's "monkey" that is used as a racial slur against black Americans. The animal in the cartoon was a chimpanzee - which not even closely related to monkeys. So even playing the race card on that level fails.<br>  <br>  Get over it. A bit over 50% of this country voted Obama into office - and the "black vote" only accounts for 12% of all voters. That means the majority of votes that put Obama into power were "white votes". Sorry - the race card has just been stamped *V*O*I*D*.|`|4b9a85a6035089657723b2a7f272c834aa	Another "boy who cried racism" post. How original. Oops, I said "boy." Is that racist, too? The problem is when people cry racism for every tiny little possible thing, the real acts of racism get diminished. Are you really upset over a cartoon? Get over it. Bush looked like a chimp, Obama looks like Curious George. It's just the way it is. How do you think racism will ever be overcome in this country when people always have that card at the top of their deck?|`|QGBSOpt7aa	IF Obama wrote the stimulus, you MAY have a leg to stand on...<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, Obama didnt write it.

It is now 2009.  GET OVER IT...<br>  <br>  You tell me what years you were forced to pick cotton in the fields for no pay, and you yourself were a slave, and I will gladly appoligize.  the fact is, this Slavery race card has been played for far too long.

First time I saw it, I laughed, not because I thought about Obama, but because I found it amusing that they were saying the stimulus package was so horrible, a monkey could have essentially wrote it. Now, Obama never crossed my mind (maybe thats because he didnt actually write the stimulus package...), and I was surprised when all these liberal racists started whining about it.<br>  <br>  From my point of view, I'm not the racist one here. I found the comic funny for non-racist reasons, and I feel I'm not racist at all... I see everyone equally. However, those that are complaining about this comic are the true racists... the first thing they see is an insult, which shows they still don't see themselves as equals to everyone else. This could be because they think they are better than everyone else, or think they are owed something because of past wrongdoings, it doesnt matter why. That fact is, they are the racist ones here, as they don't see themselves as equals. <br>  <br>  To the people who found this insulting: Get over it. You are not owed anything for actions done to you ancestors. Move on, get a life, work hard on your own, and stop looking for government handouts and attention from the media... the majority of us really don't care anymore, and are getting tired of this...|`|AA10106002	Since I think monkeys are intelligent, capable of amazing things and appealing, does it mean Obama is none of those?

Maybe you're not that persuasive after all. Maybe if you try again and call them racists it will improve your odds.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	It was not about Obama because he didn't write the stimulus bill.

That's what this cartoon is referencing.<br>  <br>  that and the poorly written stimulus bill ( which Obama DID NOT write) as well as the Chimp that was killed in Conn.  The only reason people are considering it racist is because they are looking for racism wherever they can to make a fuss.<br>  <br>  if you think Obama wrote the bill then your an idiot. the cartoon was clearly talking about the Writers of the bill and not the guys that signed it.<br>  <br>  i am an advocate for equal rights and free speech. i also try to endorse a better education, which is something you seem to need.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Oh lord... grow a pair please... the only people that thought there was racial conotations to it are racists anyway...

There has long been this public image that all the 'big bosses' in public and private organisations were Masons and would look out for other Masons. In an attempt to deny and disprove this, they went to the other extreme and started to disadvantage and discriminate against Masons.

It is obvious that the brethren will do all they can to protect the honour of the craft, but it would be done legally and before any dishonesty came to light.

The Church's are a bit over whelmed trying to help these families sense our community has been hit hard here too in the South West . .<br>  I am very glad that Obama made that statement to the Mayors in our country. You would think that Republicans would approve but then again not they way Republicans have been acting now days I guess.|`|htSZsds7aa	Yah know all presidents spend spend and spend some more.

They fly into Iraq and rescue the injured and fly them to Ramstein,Germany AFB Hospital then back to Alexandria, VA. It is very rewarding, he says, I know that he loves his job, he in now stationed here at home, but I would say the air guard is a little easier than the marines. I had a friend who jumped ship with the marines. With the Air Guard right now they are offering a $20,000 sign bonus, and they will reimburse some college, and you can also work towards your masters degree. My husband has been in since he was 18 part time and full time for three and half years. The retirement is good, and when the economy sucks, you still have a job. It takes a arm and a leg for someone to get fired. You will always have a job with pay, unlike everything else, and retirement benefits. With the way the world is, besides being in the health field this is the only sure thing for a job for now. Hope this helps. If you have questions, find your local Air Guard recruiting Office. Air is more professional, Army is a little rough around the edges.|`|BGPfLOmYaa	Who said "I ain't no Marine, I am a soldier"..WHAT!!?? Are you serious??

Show me Wall Street is ready for making money and not a short term money grab|`|fofzdoROaa	The word "profit" is open to several interpretations. It could mean to earn interest (or yield) on capital investment. Or it could mean to get rich due to taking the chance to exploit the community in some way, perhaps due to be monopolistic in ones control of the opportunities.    I suspect Obama was referring to the second kind and not the first meaning. What he wants is a price reduction to reasonable levels where the amount of benefit to the monopolists is not excessive.     In any case as far as Wall Street is concerned there are no profits to be had at present, the opposite is more likely! So what else is this statement but pretence or rhetoric?|`|rV1uAtt3aa	It depends on whether or not you believe we all deserve to benefit from our economy.  If you do, then big business and maximizing profits is not something you should believe in.  Clearly having all of our eggs in a few massive corporate baskets has left us at the edge of oblivion - which is why we can't allow some of these companies to fail; and when companies try to maximize profits the money winds up being spent on private jets and golden parachutes instead of jobs and responsible environmental practices.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	America has already been run into the ground.

uoBoo8ouaa	If I remember correctly (it was several months ago), the beeps were equally spaced and repeated approximately 6 - 8 times in a certain tone before switching to another frequency or level or ear and then starting over again.  Make of that what you will.    I'm not too good at hearing, at least that's what my last girlfriend has told me, so it may have gone past that 6 to 8 tone mark.  Hope it helps|`|kbz5S3waaa	You'll be find, press the button even if you think you heard something, it will sound like one of those ringing noises you get in your ears naturally - still push the button. (my husband is legally deaf in one ear and he still managed to pass that test?)|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	Unless you actually have hearing loss (and your Dr should have told you if you did) then no worries, the hearing test actually tests at levels and frequencies beyond normal hearing levels just to ensure the test is accurate and capture the true range of an individual.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	Don't worry too much if you had low-frequency hearing loss. Sometimes it is temporary due to a cold or something like that. Loss in the low frequencies are called conductive hearing loss. Sometimes is it more serious like a tumor in the ear. Usually it is from sinus drainage or inner-ear infection and it clears up.    If your doctor didn't seem too worried about it or send you for other tests then it was likely a temporary thing.    Some times a ruptured ear drum can cause it or something called swimmer's ear.  As long as there is no damage to the ear you will usually have better hearing the next time you take the test.    It is the high frequency loss that is worse. that is the sensory type and is almost always permanent.     I am a certified hearing conservationist and I work in an audiology clinic. When I was in the Navy I did hearing tests. I was a Corpsman.    They will test your hearing agian at MEPS. There are certian frequencies around 2K-6K that they look at most closely. Those aren't the low-frequencies you are talking about.

5ef5912f6a90f654f9ff6a1087d77a18aa	I would tell all Americans that people who don't work don't get bonuses.  I would NOT give $ to companies that do not know how to manage the enormous amounts they already had.  I would put $$ directly into supporting companies to create jobs and nowhere else...not into STDs, birth control, etc.  There are already places for that.  I would cut every last non-essential item in current government spending, use the $ to boost the military and or its resoures. I would offer reduced loans indefinitely only to those who served our country, others could find subsidized housing if necessary.    I would ask American people to write to me submitting their ideas on where money is  being wasted in great amounts and any suggestions they had as how to eliminate this problem.  There would be a $10,000 reward on those that were selected.  (Distributed on a first come/first serve basis...Where many were compiled into one idea that was acted upon, the $ would be evenly distributed with 5 being the limit so each person would get at least $2K)    Finally, I would ask each American on their taxes if they would be willing to donate $50 of their tax refund to the veteran's hospitals if the government matches the donation.|`|Y7WgMgBxaa	I believe that the reason the American public is in a deep-freeze is they, we, all know where all the money is ending up. And we are sick of it. They want us to pay to fix our roads. What the hell were they doing all this time. When they had some money they avoided the "need" chores like the plague. Now that we are "broke" we need to spend all the money that was "wasted" when we were "rollin' in the dough". Everyone "at the top" of ANY company or gov. agency that is failing and need help, need to go. Just like it is in the "real world". No "golden packages", no "pat on the back". You screwed up, your gone. When this happens, and the public can see their will being exacted, then you will see the "spirit" that it will take to recover. Not before then. We are just pouring gas on the fire with these types of bail-out packages. If I were the President, I would, at least, try to "set things right" in the eyes of the American people. We deserve it.|`|b81H0vlYaa	I would set more restrictions on the people receiving welfare and free housing.  If after 6 months of this aid, you have not made an effort to better yourself then you would stop receiving it.  This would stimilate the economy two different ways.  I know there are people who truly do need this, if you failed the 6 months, then there would be a period where an agent would come to your home and assess your needs, then your aid could continue for whatever amount of time the agent feels is necessary, including lifetime.  Also, you will not get any more aid for having more than two children.  If you cannot support them on your own, then you do not need to have any more.  If you can't afford day care while you go work at McDonald's, go to work at a day care, usually they will give you free child care if you are an employee.    Meanwhile all of this is happening, the middle class, such as myself and my husband are working over 40 hours a week each and barely making it because we are being taxed to death to give money to someone who is not even attempting to better themselves.  They are just content in looking for their next handout.  I pay for insurance but cannot afford a CT scan, that I need, but if I didn't have a job or insurance, I'm sure I could get it for free.    Also, no government money should go to illegal immigrants living in the US.    You can say this is insensitive, but that is the way I feel right now.  I know of way to many people that are "milking" this and are not even looking for jobs who are fully capable of working.    One more thing, tax big businesses more and small ones less.  It is harder for a smaller business to thrive because there is taxes on their taxes!  They are the heart of our economy, not these huge companies that paid their employees too much and are now needing bailouts.  Why are we bailing them out, so they can make the same mistakes again?  That money should have gone to education or hosptials, not a huge company.|`|tv4xKsoraa	io farei quello che sta facendo Obama in Usa|`|Souvww0maa	1)  Issue an executive order for IRS Audits for all members of congress and all appointed positions - judges included.    2)  Issue an executive order freezing IRA audits on the middle class for 2 years (This is so the IRS has plenty of auditors for the congress and appointed officials)    3)  Explain to congress why their earmark package contains no stimulus and that real economic growth comes from private investment, not wasteful government spending.    4)  Ask congress to create a stimulus bill containing only stimulus involving tax cuts to corporations, private citizens and investors.|`|EMWrT6imaa	Teach MR.

Tell Nancy Pelosi and her crew that you'll put the names of every rep responsible next to each earmark and hand it over to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and any media outlet that requests it if they don't toe the line.    Then propose a 6 month payroll and income tax holiday for the American people as a stimulus package.  I doubt he would have any problems getting popular support for that.  Otherwise if it doesn't pass, all the names of the reps that voted against it will be made VERY public.    Send a Nimitz class super carrier to park off the South Korean peninsula.     Fund the Alaskan National Guard Anti-missile defense systems.  Missiles are not going to come at us from across the Pacific or Atlantic, they'd be sent over the arctic circle.  Middle eastern and North Korean missile threats neutralized. Help Japan and Israel by giving them Patriot missile batteries as well.|`|8rGZFBKOaa	First, I'd bring in the snap cup.     Secondly, I'd inform both the House and the Senate they will be taking a pay cut and if they don't like it, they can quit.     Thirdly, I would go to each of our great and wonderful fifty states and appoint everyday, ordinary U.S. citizens to be members of my administration - NO ONE from Congress, NO politicians - just regular folks without agendas and favors to pay back.     Fourthly, I'd take every single bill to the people and have each and every line read out loud on prime time television. I'd give out the telephone numbers and email addresses of every Senator and Congressperson for the people to voice their opinion. I'd include an additional phone number and email address for those citizens who don't trust their state politicians to do what they tell them to do. I'd report the number of calls made by each state to each Senator and House Representative and what they are calling in favor of or against.  I'd report this information directly to the people on prime time television.    Fifthly, I'd send out a check to each and every citizen of the USA every 6 months to actually STIMULATE THE ECONOMY (citizens with money, spend money...... sssshhhhh...... for some it's a secret.)    Sixthly, I'd insist that each and every child under the age of 10 has free healthcare, period, end of discussion, don't like it.... then YOU apply for President.     Seventhly (As President I can make up words if I want), I'd have a monthly "Serious Issues" phone in and talk show on topics that affect us all - abortion, racism, sexism, religion, corruption, etc. Rush, Hannity and O'Reilly will always be welcomed guests.    Eighthly, I'd make it so you MUST produce a thumb print and signature in order to vote. No thumb print, no vote. No signature, no vote. Don't fill out the voting form right, no vote. Can't count right, you're fired. Cartoon characters, dead people and bottom of various lake dwellers registered as voters, whoever registered them..... fired.  Spin your ridiculous explanations somewhere else.     Ninethly, No more voting "present" in the House or the Senate. If you can't take a stand for your state, then you don't deserve to represent it! Yes or no, period!     And Tenthly but not final........ I would make English the official language of this great nation (if it's not already at this writing). Free English classes to all U.S. citizens (teachers of these classes would be given course credit toward their degrees of choice or some other kind of credit which I would be open to any and most all serious suggestions.)

The media might make a huge deal out of this, but that doesn't mean that we can't use our own judgment and remember times that we haven't done something correctly.  I would bet that 90% of Americans have purposely fudged their taxes at some point, and these guys seem to have done it inadvertently due to a misunderstanding, yet we are going to publicly flog them.    Isn't it time that Americans started to use some judgment and discernment about the things they hear on TV?

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	If you actually study history you will find that government never functions well when one party controls everything. This is because there really is no need for bipartisan sentiment in order to move the agenda during these times. I would not count on a lot happening which is deemed bipartisan over the next two years.

We have different political parties in this country to ensure that not one agenda is pushed through.  Everyone asking or expecting everyone in the US "to get along" is being unrealistic.  The country basis is on freedom, we are all free to believe what we want and express ourselves in non-violent ways.  HaHa.

JxYLnTGiaa	The economy is very tricky. I don't think the Government can do much considering this is a capitalistic country.<br>  <br>  It's all about supply and demand. Keep in mind that demand for homes, goods and services were high for the last 8-10 years because of CREDIT. Everyones was buying everything on credit... college, homes, cars, clothes, vacations, etc.<br>  <br>  So when everything got out of hand and people could not pay back their debt, credit lenders went belly up. So now its hard to borrow money for most things. <br>  <br>  So if you can't afford anything and you can't borrow money to buy it... guess what? YOU DON'T BUY IT.<br>  <br>  So this means demand goes DOWN. When demand goes down, productions slows down and people lose their jobs. <br>  <br>  This is what has happened. It will have a very bad effect on the American standard of living for a very long time to come.

CowgOqXTaa	White won.    Samsung ran an ad that featured (with the consent of the shows producers) a "Wheel of Fortune" set from some time in the future, the hostess of which was not Vanna White but a robot in a blonde wig and sating gown.     White sued, arguing that the robot was 'evocative' of her role on the show, and that she was therefore entitled to compensation for the use of her likeness. The District Court disagreed, holding that Samsung had not used White's likeness in putting a wig and a gown on a robot.     White appealed to the 9th Circuit, a three judge panel of which held that the robot was intended to remind people of White's role, and that it therefore was a "likeness" of White, and they remanded the case back to the district Court. Samsung asked the 9th to rehear the appeal en banc, and they declined. They then asked the Supreme Court to grant cert, and they also declined.     The case was never reheard by the district Court as, after SCOTUS denied cert, White and Samsung settled out of court.    Richard

You should consult the contract.... generally there is a provision for how much advance notice must be given and it makes an exception for emergency repairs.<br>  <br>  If you think the former guardian is not in compliance with any of these things DO NOT set up "booby traps."  They are not legal anywhere for any reason.<br>  <br>  You can set up a camera....perhaps with a motion sensor.... and once you have evidence that the landlord is violating the lease you should be able to break your lease and get out of there without monetary consequence.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you just need a reason to break the lease... and this would be your potential way out. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|WD6uLJxvaa	You can set up a camera.<br>  <br>  You can either set up a web cam that you can access from other locations or you can place a hidden camera to record while you are not there.
2lFRYr8Eaa	Go to court.  Dress neatly.  Do not confess anything up front.  Find out what the indicated plea offer is.  If you like it, then take it.  Plead No Contest, if they will take that plea.  Do not get angry.  I you do not like the plea offer (this ties to the plea, since if you confess, it can come in against you, if the case needs to go to trial).  <br>  If the offer is bad, ask if you can talk to a public defenders.  Public Defenders are trained attorneys at law, and they can help you make a decision.  Plus, anything you say to your public defender is protected and can not be used against you, it is known as attorney-client privilege.|`|AA11206283	Odds are you'll get community service and maybe an AM class<br>  <br>  Dress well<br>  <br>  Show remorse and respect.<br>  <br>  Apologise; even if you don't mean it|`|1KGXts5Daa	When you say "I have court Monday", what do you mean??  Do you know?<br>  <br>  Is Monday your arraignment?  Your pretrial hearing?  Your preliminary hearing?  Your trial?<br>  <br>  I am going to assume that Monday is your arraignment.  At the arraignment you will be given a copy of the complaint, informed of the charges filed, advised of your constitutional rights and asked to enter a plea (of either "not guilty", "no contest", or "guilty").  <br>  <br>  Do not follow the advice of anyone telling you to be prepared to apologize to the victim.  She will not be there.<br>  <br>  Do not follow the advice of anyone telling you that the court (the judge) will feel disrespected by the fact that you are not represented by legal counsel, or that the court will be "harsh" with you because of it.  That is bad information.<br>  <br>  There is a saying in the field of law: "Anyone who represents themselves in court has a fool for a client".  However, you are well within your legal rights to do so, and the court will not take offense.<br>  <br>  There is no need to apologize to the judge for serving as your own counsel.<br>  <br>  The advice about dressing nicely and showing proper respect is very good.  Judges should always be addressed as "Your Honor".<br>  <br>  Do not expect to have any conversation about "anger management class", or any type of sentencing at all (if you enter a plea of "not guilty", which would be my recommendation).  <br>  <br>  Do not expect to relate any detail of the confrontation with the other female which led to your court appearance.  None of that is a part of an arraignment.<br>  <br>  You will be asked to enter a plea.  You alone (at least for now) have to decide between one of two (I am removing one) options.  You may choose to plead either: "not guilty" or, "no contest".<br>  <br>  I highly recommend consulting with a criminal defense attorney prior to your court appearance; not because of the severity of the charge, but because of possible future repercussions which you are not even aware of.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1HLPznZhaa	I hope you learned a lesson.What you did was deplorable...

You may have a fine or you may not depending on how the judge looks at this..You are 18 years old and entering the adult world..Start acting like an adult..Good luck|`|56917efc2d4323a083e26002e4c680fcaa	I don't think your chances are good at avoiding a little jail time and it is not because of your crime. It is for disrespecting the court. Do not represent your self, you might believe this is a minor thing but judges are harsh when they think they have been disrespected. If nothing else apologize to the judge and court first and then to the lady you spit on. Good luck.

And if you make a mistake it's do it all over again.<br>  <br>  Add to that numerous other evidence from other cases coming in at the same time, the back log of old evidence to get to and then there are priority cases.<br>  <br>  CSI type shows are good at showing what is possible to the point they now don't revel exactly what they really do to keep criminals from using it to destroy evidence.<br>  <br>  I'd love to see a real CSI show shoot like 24 from the time they are called till the judge's gavel lands in court.  Most people would get bored watching a program that runs for six to eight months straight.|`|RQvLrKMXaa	It depends upon whether the police dept. in your area has the facilities for processing forensic evidence.  Very few communities have the resources for expensive testing equiipment and the evidence has to be outsourced to either privately owned labs or to the FBI lab in virginia, which can take up to a year to receive results.|`|95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	The reason is the heavy load of work and how understaffed they are (that lab might be getting evidence from every single small & big towns so that's a lot of work); it's quite normal to wait over six months or more if your case has a low priority; criminal investigations are usually given priority over non-crime related evidence so sometimes yours can get pushed back.<br>  <br>  Do not pay attention to those 8 or 12 weeks number you were given, that was just a guess not a promise. Also unlike what we are shown on TV, lab results take time and a lot of work. It's not like putting a drop into a machine and five seconds later you get a print out with all the details.

m6C3pgChaa	I'm curious, is he deployed or is he just stationed overseas?|`|3caq6SFxaa	You can force him to do what you want when he returns from overseas; most laws have exceptions to forcing things right now when a person is over seas but that protection is while overseas.  Was written to protect military members from various things done badly in the past and some times interferes with some thing necessary but over all is a good law.  Hiring another lawyer will not help and what you need to do is wait until he is back-you can file for support from the date of birth so would be reimbursed for your expenses if he is the father.  You can also get a dependents identification card for the child and the child would be eligigle for medical, dental andhealth care through the dependents care systm.  You would not be and the purchases using the identity card would be restricted to things for the child.|`|zSABr7praa	Those in the military are protected while over seas, like another posted, they can delay any proceedings until they return.  My brother in law is a Lawyer in the Navy (Jag) and my husband is a 1LT in the Marine corp.  I'm very well aware that they have to report any civil disputes that they have to their superiors.... They have to report speeding tickets! Your lawyer needs to contact them and fill them in on the situation, at which point you'll probably be informed that you'll need to wait until he returns here.  You can always sue for back payments of child support, the court could actually order them anyways.<br>  <br>  That's a rough situation, I wish you the best.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Another significant protection under the act relates to civil proceedings. Service members involved in civil litigation can request a delay in proceedings if they can show their military responsibilities preclude their proper representation in court. This provision is most often invoked by service members who are on an extended deployment or stationed overseas. "I would recommend a service member contact the unit or installation legal office immediately if they receive notice of court proceedings against them," Lindemann said. "Civil court proceedings can involve very complex issues and no one should do anything, including requesting a stay of proceedings, prior to seeking legal advice." <br>  <br>  To learn more about these or other provisions of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, contact your unit or installation legal assistance office.|`|vD7HquRgaa	dang, that sounds pretty shady. Perhaps you should of got to know him better before you wound up getting pregnant by him. In anycase, you need to wait to the service member is back in the united states. If it's crucial that you get it now, i.e the kids sick and it needs blood, something like that you could contact JAG and they'd actually help you. Other then that, they'll probably tell you to wait til he gets back. Right now it's your word against his, you don't know if he's the father yet, and if you do know you don't have proof. If there's a lawsuit against him AND he received the paperwork, i can guarantee his CO already knows about it; which in that case, if he hasn't acted on it yet (the lawsuit) then he's probably doing something pretty important overseas and you'll just have to wait til he returns. Don't hire a new lawyer, you'll be wasting time and money. Just wait it out til he returns. If he is the father, you'll be eligible to receive childsupport from the date of the childs birth, so whether u get it now or 5 months from now, itll be the same amount.|`|AA11917018	Call his JAG office..|`|AA10709853	as long as he is deployed you can do exactly NOTHING until 90 days after he returns from the deployment.  <br>  <br>  he is protected under  SCRA. fro any and all legal action while deployed.   Not like he can submit a DNA test while in country anyway.|`|tDZMJue9aa	do you know where he is stationed, find that out and then get in contact through your lawyer with the legal office there, yes he is protected while stationed overseas but they also wont let him slide on his responsiblities, and what good is an id card if your kid is 23 and military people can stay overseas as long as they want....lets get real the law is in place to protect them not to let them hide from their responsibilites...so continue to fight, go through your welfare office etc and put his name down if you get anything for your child he will have to pay it back when the test comes back that says yes you are the daddy and in the long run he screwed himself hard
BImIMnbzaa	They were called leggings, and yes they were.

Data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the International Comparison Program (ICP) (a cooperative venture coordinated by the World Bank) and the U.S. Census Bureau allow a nonpartisan, factual assessment, says Marsden. <br>  <br>  Economic growth:<br>  <br>  U.S. output has expanded faster than in most advanced economies since 2000. <br>  The IMF reports that real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent over the period 2001-2008 (including its forecast for the current year). <br>  President Bush will leave his successor an economy 19 percent larger than the one he inherited from President Clinton. <br>  This U.S. expansion compares with 14 percent by France, 13 percent by Japan and just 8 percent by Italy and Germany over the same period.<br>  The latest ICP findings, published by the World Bank in its World Development Indicators 2008, also show that GDP per capita in the United States reached $41,813 (in purchasing power parity dollars) in 2005; this was a third higher than the United Kingdom's, 37 percent above Germany's and 38 percent more than Japan's.<br>  Household consumption:<br>  <br>  The ICP study found that the average per-capita consumption of the U.S. population (citizens and illegal immigrants combined) was second only to Luxembourg's, out of 146 countries covered in 2005. <br>  The U.S. average was $32,045; this was well above the levels in the UK ($25,155), Canada ($23,526), France ($23,027) and Germany ($21,742).

How can we continue to make all countries in this world love us and respect freedom if we don't have military bases in their country, support their suppressive leaders or give them weapons and money?  Plus, everyone knows that all world empires endure forever and are financially sustainable.  <br>  <br>  Second, he wants to make me (us) responsible for our own actions both socially and financially.  Like that is ever gonna happen.  If the government wasn't there to tell me that something is wrong I would be doing it all day.  If there was no war on drugs I would be shooting up this minute while burning tires in my wood stove.  If the NSA was not listening to my phone calls I might say something stupid.  If the government didn't take payroll taxes from my check how could I possibly retire or pay off my home?  I would be spending that extra money on drugs and tires to burn in my stove.  The government needs to save me from myself.  <br>  <br>  Third, this wackjob wants to end the Federal Reserve and its monopoly on our money.  Whats wrong with a private organization in control of our nations wealth?  We don't need to know the details on what is happening with our money other than we need to spend more of it!  Our children and grandchildren might spend all their wealth on candy and we need to stop that now by spending it for them on our prosperity, mistakes and lifestyle.  Also, if the Fed didn't keep interest rates artificially low I might have to save money instead of borrow it.  If I had to pay 15% interest on my third mortgage I might reconsider taking out that loan to buy my 3rd new Cadillac Escalade rolling on 22" blings.<br>  <br>  Finally, I heard him today say that he does not think that printing new money out of thin air is true capital creation.

We need to gather our friends close and stand for what we believe and believe you me, it will be challenged.

Most military units have a set inventory and there is a specified set of equipment issued based on your job within the unit.    However I understand that in the past, in some special forces units they are able to select from a list of personal sidearms but I believe that they were required to purchase them on their own.

The "special" weapons, as it were, are due to their positions in the unit.  For instance, on a patrol, a soldier or two might carry a SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon), as their position is the Machine Gunner.  In addition to their standard weapon, some may carry a rocket launcher as additional ordinance.  Obviously, considerations are taken...they are not going to overburden a soldier that couldn't carry a SAW for a 30k ruck.

Personal attributes of the soldiers have no bearing on the matter.|`|AYZxWD36aa	Weapon assignment in the US Military depends on the soldier's/marine's specialization. With the Marines, everyone is trained to use either the M-16A4 assault rifle or the M4A1 Carbine. Even with that said, it depends on each man's specialization. Sniper/Scouts are different from Designated Marksmen.    Usually, in each squad (10-20 soldiers/marines), there is at least 2 soldiers with Light Machine Guns such as the M249, 1 or 2 with a DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle), and the rest are normal riflemen carrying an M16 or one of its variants. A few men in each Platoon (4 or 5 squads) are Combat Engineers, carrying either a submachine gun or an assault rifle, a shotgun, and sometimes an AT-4 or Javelin anti-tank weapon system.|`|AA11156037	The service/ unit Table of Organization outline which persons will carry which sidearm, rifle or other weapon     (BTW in the military, GUNS are called WEAPONS).

hcc8fq7jaa	Listen to the people defending their icons! Funny, if a Republican were caught cheating on their taxes, wouldn't they be all high and mighty about it? Imagine the 24 hour a day news coverage on that! The fact is, when the little guys like you and me and even the other posters don't pay our taxes, or, as was suggested, make "errors", we can be fined and/or imprisoned. When congressmen or senators (of either party) cheat, it's ok, because they have connections. Rather then making it a partisan argument, we should ALL demand higher standards from our "representatives".|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Its not fraud, they paid taxes for all those years, they didn't pay the full amount as the IRS figured it differently than they did.  It happens all the time.  Fraud is a different deal altogether.  And evasion is when you try not to pay at all, these people did pay their taxes.  Some of their deductions were not upheld and they were found to owe more than they paid.  Again, if you are an adult you have heard the same story a dozen times.    If a Republican were caught, I'd feel the same, the tax codes are a mess, they are a mess for everyone.  Trying to pin this on one party or another is just dumb.|`|rVPrhd26aa	90% of people commit tax fraud and most do this without knowing it, I'm sure if a lawyer were to look at your filed taxes this year they would find one tiny thing you wouldn't even realize and call it tax fraud. Because of technical wording and other issues these mistakes happen all the time. The gov doesn't actually investigate your taxes, they don't have the time or man power to actually look over every person's taxes, they just write your check. they only investigate things that seem fishy, or celebrity/government officials to create media frenzies.
nbibIzC5aa	You definitely need to get an attorney because filing an answer inappropriately could lead to a summary judgment being ruled against you (you lose without a trial).  There are ways to get an attorney to help you.  Do some research for free legal aid.  Many states have associations which provide free legal assistance in many areas of the law.      If you decide to do this yourself, an answer is simply that, an answer.  In the petition the plaintiff will state the facts of their case against you.  It may start identifying you by name and where you live.  It will then lay out the facts as they believe it and will end with the judgment they seek.  The trouble with filing an answer yourself could lead you to agree with a statement in their petition which eliminates your right to dispute the issue of fact at a trial.  So read the petition well.  Its ok to agree if the fact is a true statement in which you wish not to dispute in court.  If you do disagree with a statement on the petition but do not know the facts, then state that as such.  The wording does not have to sound as though you have a working knowledge of the law.  Lastly, you must address each issue presented in the petition.  If the petition has twenty paragraphs, then each paragraph has to be addressed.  If a paragraph is skipped then it is treated as a agreement of the issue and thus you cannot challenge it in a court of law.  So if that first paragraph has your address and its correct, just state that it is such and move on to the next paragraph.      If you are concerned with how your answer looks, simply format the answer in the same form as the petition.  This will also help you when answering each of the issues in question.    I cannot stress enough that you should get an attorney.  An attorney will look for any exceptions in the law which could get you out of this situation.  They will answer the petition and will know which issues to dispute.  Another reason why getting an attorney to help is because you cannot expect to have the judgment against you thrown out due to a lack of legal knowledge.  An attorney may also help you be declared as an indigent defendant in the court which means that the court fees would be waived.    **This is not legal advice nor should it be treated as such.**    Hope this helps.|`|eebe66a3a4bd4b0bbf8c0da45b2f62abaa	Know your rights:  Google "Fair Debt Collection Practices"    Also:  Do not admit to the debt to anyone.  phone, letter, etc.    You have a right to have the information that the creditor has.  request it from the court.    the owner of the debt (providian) may have sold the debt to another party for collection.  so, don't be worried about it being a different company.  Just do the three things above and good luck.|`|Gezfmghuaa	Your first step is to call CACH and see if you can work out payment arrangements.  If you can, just make the payments and you'll be fine.  The court case will be suspended as long as you do.  It's in both of your interests for them to do so.      As someone said, you can also request verification of the debt, but it sounds like they provided that with a copy of a valid final bill.    If you cannot come to an arrangement and are taken to court, the court can impose a judgement on you, and the creditor will be able to put a lien against any property you have.|`|pRSJrGQDaa	Request the Court to order the other party to provide the details of analysed transactions up to date for your account/transaction.

You need to check out sol for your state on credit card debt. if its passed the sol make sure you state this in your answer. If not passed sol you need to check out the state law about contract.

AA11494150	Requirements are determined by state law and department policy, so they will vary. Some states require a college degree, many only require a high school diploma. They all require a police academy, which is usually about 5 or 6 months long.    Many departments have a website with recruiting information. Do an internet search of a department in your area, that will give you a good idea of what is required.|`|mDDUsNG9aa	Most Departments require a certain amount of college usually a Bachelors degree or a combination of credits and military time, once you go complete the hiring process you attend the police academy some are live in some are not and the time in the academy is about 6 months of intense training.

Then to proclaim that we should all remember that Daschle is a man of the highest integrity and knows more about health care than anybody else.   Yeah, that's why he got paid millions for consulting for companies that he would then be regulating????  No conflicts of interest there.  Nooooo.

The tax error was resolved five months after the lien was filed.|`|vFHXrOHNaa	Since 33% turnout to be Tax Evaders? How about Audit of 537+  as Executive Order Number "XYZ"?  Now we have three people confirmed who evaded taxes and two of them are most likely going to be part of the Obama Cabinet.    Why not President Sign an Executive order IRS Audit of all 535 in the Congress and Himself and the Vice President Plus their Spouses for Tax evasion or illegal alien employees. and this shall be repeated every four years and shall look in to the legally allowed 7 years in the past.    I am not talking about just the Cabinet of the President, I am Talking about 535 members of the Congress and President and Vice President and Their Spouses if they own their own business and file separate taxes. (John McCain & Cindy and Barak and Michelle for example)    This for the entire Federal Legislative and Executive Branch.    And this is to repeat every 4 years.    One thing I forgot was USCIS audits as well.    IRS performs over 120000 Audits of Citizens mostly small business owners. these need to be put a stop on until all the congress is clear of their Audit.

dJdf92Xfaa	Not 100% sure but only 1 can claim DEERS for them.  I think it depends on who has custody of the children and where they live.    If your children live with you and your husband permantly, then your husband should be the one claiming DEERS and BAH.  The Marine should be paying child support only, not collecting BAH.|`|WpxhXXKMaa	How does your husband get BAH for your kids? Did he legally adopt them? Is his name on their births certificates? I'm confused! He should get BAH for you being his dependent because you are married, not for his step-children!|`|xjb72SOpaa	That's a unique situation that needs to be addressed with both the Army and USMC Personnel and Finance Offices. It depends on who the children reside with that would determine if both parties are even able to claim BAH for the children. Your husband would still receive the same amount of BAH because of you. There is one set rate for BAH, no matter how many dependents the member claims. But for the purposes of ensuring that what each party is doing is legal, definitely check with the appropriate on-base agencies.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	The dad has to claim them not your husband, when my hsuband was and I was dual military I claimed my kids and he claimed his (he was payign child support for his kids) around tax time he only claimed my kids on taxes. I think your husband can only claim your kids on taxes and not for BAH, because your hubby doe snot provide your kid's with the ID cards and if anyoen finds out, the **** will hit the fan and you will owe the Arkmy alot of $$$!|`|LwPcGpAOaa	All I can tell you is that both of them cannot have them on their DEERS and collect BAH on them.  Why does your new husband need to do this.  He can claim just you and still get the same BAH.  Let the kids father claim them.  They are his kids.|`|G6yyceAxaa	since your husband is the primary caregiver and the children reside with him  their dad will not be eligible for basic allowance for house with dependents,    he may have a support order that says he must provide health insurance, however it should be modified because both your husband and their father are members of the military. (basically they have the same insurance, and it is being billed twice for the same participants)    he may get BAH without dependents because he does have to pay child support.
dUWqW27paa	Be a man and turn yourself in. NOW kid! If you go to any installation, they will take care of the rest. Don't run from this. If you have to do jail time, do it. Do what is right and honorable. That might get you leniency. You have done the deed, just face the music and do something that your kids might be proud of you for. Take your punishment like a man. That is how you can be a good role model not only to any future kids you might have, but to any cousins, nieces, nephews or neighbors. It is time for you to stop this train from coming any farther off of the tracks. Don't do anything crazy. Just go in there and take care of business and soon. The sooner you can stand up and say, OK I screwed up and I wanna be a man and I am going to take whatever they give out, the better you will feel and the sooner you will be able to heal. You will be glad in the long run. I hope it all turns out for the best for you.|`|AA12164888	You can turn yourself into any local law agency as a deserter.

Bonus on the first one is people in your original unit get TDY to drive up there pick you up, and drive back.    But regardless you would be prosecuted at the base you were stationed.      If you left while they were deployed, more than likely you're looking at some jailtime... probably less than a year... Or they'll just boot you out and call it a day... depends on the commander.

So far, Obama has successfully rebuilt relations with our allies and established some diplomatic channels with our enemies. In other words, he more or less brought us back to square 1.     The War on Terror represents an excuse for unjustified war, torture, and ignoring international law and even the US Constitution (as the Supreme Court has ruled in some cases involving Gitmo). OCO is not catchy, so it will not get the same amount of play. It will some become a symbol of American intransigence and aggression.

It might seem like an immoral thing to do, but hey, it's politics; that's the name of the game.    I'm a liberal (hell, I'm so far left that I can't drive a stick) and I hate Hollywood liberalism.  Hollywood actors and rock stars all act liberal either because it's what they personally believe (which is a rare case) or because it's been "cool" to be liberal and famous since...well, forever.  It's hard to look "cool" in Hollywood being religious and, for lack of a better term, fairly rigid.    But rest assured; Hollywood liberals don't represent us.  "Your average Democrat" is liberal because that's their genuine political belief.  Hollywood liberals are "liberal" for the sake of maintaining an image.

They may be bulding these.    Here is a quote I pulled from an article about green celebrity homes:     "With more than enough money to spare, celebrities do not have to think twice about the environment. But, nevertheless, they do. Some of the top celebrities in the game are living life with eco-friendly choices and gree homes. Celebs like Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Ed Begley Jr. all choose green homes over saving their green.    Leonardo DiCaprio has to be one of the most noticed of all eco-friendly celebrities. His home offers a wealth of features aimed at saving the environment and mother Earth. The latest green addition to his home is a $3200 green toilet. The toilet is a combination of celebrity flare and the upper echelon of green technology.    Brad Pitt approaches living green is a totally different way than Leonardo DiCaprio. Brad Pitt pays millions of dollars to help other renovate their homes and their lives in a green and eco-friendly manner. Just recently Brad Pitt paid more than $5 million to up and start a green town renovation for charity. And as if this donation was not enough, Brad Pitt and partner, Angelina Jolie, are in the market to buy an island just to promote greener living.    The most green of all celebrities has to be Ed Begley Jr. Ed Begley Jr. tops the charts when it comes to changing the way we live in our homes for the sake of nature. From bicycling his way to a perfect piece of toast to competing with his neighbors and friends to have the best energy panels on his homes roof, Ed Begley Jr. lives as close to nature as he can without giving up the four walls of his home.    Some celebrities have moved from living the lavish life of excess to living a green, eco-friendly existence. When it comes to gadgets and gizmos for the green home, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Ed Begley Jr are at the top of the green game.

If you are 18 or over you have no choice...your going to jail or prison.|`|jb3f475Raa	well, its been said that juveniles are more violent and somewhat more dangerous than adults but, both juvies and jails can be pretty violent. it seems that offenders tried as adults are usually behind bars for a shorter time than juveniles and its easier to get time cuts in most jails.one downfall in going to a jail instead of a juvie would be that your record will never be sealed or expunged unless you stay out of trouble and pay for it to be cleared about 10 years down the road.but if you are a juvenile your record is usually always sealed. so it kind of depends on you.

He is stupid or he is evil. I'm sad to say, I think he is not stupid and he intends to do exactly what he is doing. <br>  <br>  Evil is being created by funding the murder of premature infants.<br>  Misery is being promoted in many ways, by slowing the economy more people will suffer. Poverty is being created by taxing the rich who, in turn, make employees work harder for less, they make customers pay more for less, They make shareholders earn less on investments. At every possible opportunity and speech, he incites people to envy the rich.<br>  <br>  Fighting evil. is not evil indeed, if good doesn't fight evil, evil will flourish and become stronger. He is promoting the world hatred of America. Could that be to say our example of fighting for good and freedom is not worthwhile? <br>  <br>  These are the decisions of a smart--well-educated, but evil, kind of leader.|`|TsjqzanQaa	So far, while I don't think that Mr. Obama is stupid, I think he's sadly lacking in ethics.<br>  <br>  His appointment of Geithner as Treasury Secretary, when the man can't or won't even pay his own taxes shows incredibly bad judgment, and that cronies are more important than justice.<br>  <br>  His attempted appointment of Daschle was only withdrawn after public outrage became too strong to ignore, and even Obama admitted that he "screwed up."<br>  <br>  If he screwed up with Daschle, then it's the same with Geithner, yet he retained Geithner.<br>  <br>  I don't agree that he's upsetting the balance of trade, as it isn't balanced to begin with.     We import far too many commodities and manufactured goods as it is.<br>  <br>  And our government's main occupation is "diddling" as you put it, where they shouldn't be.      That's one reason that America is so disliked in most of the rest of the world.       Our government has no business trying to run the rest of the world; we have problems here that we need to solve.<br>  <br>  Bad judgment and intelligence are two different things.<br>  <br>  Common sense has nothing to do with intelligence; look at our whole government and maybe you can see my point.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Yes<br>  Reading that description almost sounds like you're describing a terrorist...thats scary.|`|c1yTAGDFaa	I think its funny. The people who voted for him and voted for "change" are getting nothing. <br>  <br>  I wonder how many of the Obama supporters are furious at him for not holding true to his promises like pulling troops from Iraq and now he's even sending more to Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  If Obama would have done his homework, he would have seen that the Bush stimulus package did not work, now Obama has his own stimulus package, some governor's will not accept because it only favors minorities, and it has failed too. Obama goes to another country and folds under pressure over the "buy American" stipulation.<br>  <br>  How many times are we as Americans going to let this happen?<br>  <br>  Just because you are The President doesn't mean you are a financial wizard. Face it Obama is does not have the experience or intestinal fortitude to stand up for what he said or believes.<br>  <br>  Come on people get out of your own little rice-bowl and think about whats going on.<br>  <br>  I want my guns and freedoms, you can keep the change.<br>  <br>  Herb, get with the program and read a little.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	When did he side against Americans?    <br>  <br>  There is only one stupid man I see right now.

k2eNTeA1aa	That's a no brainer. We already have CA as a model. Look at the mess they got themselves into. Every state that is facing a financial crisis is dominated by liberals. This isn't just my honest opinion, it's a fact. I would opt for the United Conservative States.|`|PoJLz2fhaa	The liberal states, it's economics, New York, New England and the west coast are the most liberal places in the country, yet the richest too, maybe they're onto something. California by itself is the world's 8th largest economy.|`|HlTF3X3Baa	Well, the lawyers and govt. employees would flourish on the liberal side. Productive people on the conservative side.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I would flourish on either side because I'm fiscally responsible.  While I believe that the conservatives would probably have an overall better picture, neither would be without problems.  One big problem with many conservatives who espouse fiscal responsibility on the part of their government is that they don't practice it in their personal lives. There are just as many broke conservatives as there are liberals.<br>  <br>  Edit - @ shepherd - I'm in about as red a state as you can get and we're floundering.  The county I'm in is majority conservative and they're teetering on the edge of the largest county bankruptcy ever recorded.  Schools are closing across the state and class sizes have almost doubled.  Is that the definition of success?|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	I have a feeling that the conservatives would flourish since they would reward hard work.  The liberals would bring back the welfare state and reward laziness.  If you want to see a good example of this, look at what happened when Germany rejoined, the Eastern part was in poverty while the Western part was more successful.|`|nz8U5rNaaa	I really don't know. Lets do it and see what happens? The conservatives will even accept less than equal resources just to try this out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Constitution Party member.<br>  <br>  To the person under me<br>  <br>  You can't be the richest if you are in debt and broke. Just because they have a large economy doesn't make them the richest. People say the United States is the richest nation but we are in debt up to our eyeball.|`|RtHq6y78aa	I would FLOURISH on the Conservative side.<br>  Once the liberal side failed we could buy them for a song and make them all get jobs.|`|r3fmXySlaa	The conservative one obviously, because the liberal one would be so far in debt from their spending programs they would be begging the conservative one for loans.|`|b97IpZBOaa	OBAMA, PELOSI AND REID,<br>   MUST BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE.

The British were already fighting before the US entered the war, which was after Pearl Harbor. Study your history my friend. We are already waging a war on terror, if you like it or not.  Obama is continuing Bush`s troop surge by calling in 17,000 more troops.  But yes the New Deal was surely a bust/disaster to put it nicely.<br>  <br>  I dont think we will physically be in Iran as others are stating, but our bombs, rockets, unmanned drones surely will.

DypTl9Zdaa	It doesn't surprise me.  I said many times before the election that Obama is going to find a way to tax just about everything that we do.  Taxing mileage however is a big mistake.  Tourist towns, hotels and other businesses will take a huge hit because people will not be willing to travel as much.  This is not a good way to raise money in order to fund their roads and infrastructure.  Good grief...creating more jobs via roads and stuff was suppose to be in the stimulus package.

When are we the people going to wake up and say enough is enough.  People are sooooo happy about that .61 increase in tobacco taxes, touted as to encourage ppl to stop smoking, well, when smokers quit, where will the money come from, not cut backs, but just another tax somewhere (this is just an example of the mentality of our government).|`|0odpCqUGaa	Yes....and next how many windows inyour house--and for the air you breathe--and for using the sidewalks--and for being allowed to live--and for supporting illegitimate baby makers--and illegals who rap us--<br>  <br>  obama is turing America into kenya...trashy--poor-racist--corrupt--di...<br>  <br>  wright was right--God damned AMerica with obama.|`|LnWOSedEaa	I was just talking to my wife about this last night.

If this tax is enacted, then folks who work, won't go anywhere to spend money.  What will that do to our economy?  I personally will not drive to any location that I am already paying taxes to get there!  Obama is finding a way to create revenue for his agenda.  Taxation without representation is at work here.  We try to conserve where we can, but when that trickles down to us not spending money then that is not good enough for Obama.  If ever we need to contact our senators it is now.  We need not keep silent any longer, we need to act and show Obama he can't just do anything he wants.  Wake up America, please wake up.  Obama needs to realize that his travels across the globe with Iranians, and Kenyans do not reflect those of us in the US.  We are not some" other country" we did not get to be The United States by following the ideas of counrties who are in poverty, nationally speaking.  Before Obama is done, don't be surprised that everyone of us ia required to have a tracking device in our bodies so we can pay taxes on where we go.

There is NO TIME to let him complete this task.  It may be too late already.

The Clinton admin sold the premise that people in the middle east hate us because we are free and they aren’t.  Not true.  They hate us because of our actions.  Much of the world fights because of religion.  We don’t to any large extent and so we don’t even understand that.  If we would put a statue of Jesus in a vat of urine, we might offend some people but they wouldn’t kill the person who did it, or their family. <br>  <br>  Iran is not the biggest threat right now.  We can contain them.  They are surrounded by military bases and Sunnis who would kill them as look at the Shias.  Of course we don’t know what Israel would do so that is a mystery for now.  Training camps have pretty much moved out of Afghanistan and into Pakistan.  Since those borders are so vague, it was easy to do.<br>  <br>  We need to focus more on Russia and the other countries who still have open nuclear arms, and we need to get control over our borders.  We haven’t had an attack on our soil since 9-11 because they don’t need to.  They were surprised they caused so much damage with 9-11.  That’s enough for now and our economy and energy crisis is causing us problems that they couldn’t have enacted themselves.<br>  <br>  We still need to go after Bin Laden.  We knew where he was in the Clinton admin but we didn’t have the resources then (defense cuts).  Bin Laden needs to be taken out still because he is a charismatic leader who inspires and motivates, and he is smart.  However, he will probably die before we find him now.  We knew he was in Tora Bora (under the Clinton admin) but now he has moved into Pakistan and the people are more than willing to keep hiding him.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for us, Obama has now cut defense spending so we are back to the Clinton days again.

The recession that Bush "inherited" was a multI billion dollar SURPLUS, he turned it into a 38 trillion dollar DEFICIT.

I don't blame Bush for 9/11, I blame him for taking a country that was more united than ever before and dividing us like never before.  I blame him for trying to convince us that Iraq had ANYTHING to do with 9/11.  I blame him for handing out non-biddable contracts in Iraq to companies that he (and Cheney) clearly had ties to.  I blame him for not paying attention to us when we were telling him that something was askew with the economy, and he just denied it because all the people around him were making record profits & incomes through the stock market.|`|JkQKzW3daa	As a Liberal, here's what I think:<br>  <br>  I do not blame Bush for 9/11.  Did he do what he could to prevent it?  Nope.  Did he and his buddies benefit from it?  Absolutely.  Did he respond appropriately?  Not at all.  <br>  <br>  Bush did not inherit the recession.  He, and his policies, created it.  Our economy was thriving when Bush took office.  <br>  <br>  I'm not giving Obama a pass on the current state of the economy.  If he doesn't make progress towards correcting the problems, I will hold him accountable- the same way I held Bush accountable for the mess he made of this nation.  <br>  <br>  Just because a President is a Democrat, my views and expectations of a President will not change.  I expect the same from Obama as I would any other president.|`|AA11482024	I think most rational people are willing to look at the circumstances around a situation before assessing blame.

Terrorists get a lot of their money by funding illegal drugs and selling them. They get profit from drugs, and often grow them themselves. Also drug dealers will just get more money and all of the big dealers are VERY dangerous and bad people. Not to mention that drugs f*** up your body.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Drugs are legal, you have alcohol, nicotine, and all the pharmaceutical drugs,<br>  <br>  all the other narcotic illicit drugs are only illegal in order to put people in jail and create jobs for the other half to put them away, it also keeps unemployment artificially looking low and builds up the police state apparatus.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Legalize means it is ok for anyone to possess and consume.<br>  Decriminalize would be a better idea, but as you mentioned, moralists who think they have the right to control everyone else, would cry about it.<br>  <br>  I think we can do without legalizing drugs, but herbs wouldn't be all that bad.|`|zVGhHomRaa	Because, the moral connotations associated with the possession and consumption of 'drug's will be no longer existent. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, 'drugs' have been scientifically proven to induce negative effects on the body and it's functions.|`|alQ5wIVqaa	More drugs means more addicts.

Im not an addict or anything but I Have in my youth.  It is 100% natural and it comes from the earth.  We should really ban pain killers, cough medacine, peppermint flavored anything.  Rubber should be illegal.  Tobacco should be illegal.  It is only a double standard thats all it is.  Marijuana isn't Meth or Coke or Heroine.  Everyone says its a gateway drug.  Wine leads to beer bear leads to spirits and spirits lead to alcoholism.  Kids smoke cigarette in high school they think its cool, they try marijuana and then they like that so they try shrooms, meth and so on.  Everything is a gateway to other things you can't just cut on thing and say ok problem solved.  Television is a gateway to movies and movies are a gateway to violence and sex.  Sex in movies is a gateway to porn addicts.  See it can be done with ANYTHING.|`|N4Ct35GFaa	"morales"? maybe you should go to english class instead.  Drugs will not be legalized for various reasons. Marijuana won't be legalized because of the implications of hemp.  Harder drugs won't be legalized because they ruin peoples lives.  Do you seriously want the government to legalize cocaine?  Heroin?  C'mon man, get serious.<br>  <br>  On a side note, pot and shrooms should be legal.  But if you do them in your home it's not like you're going to get caught anyways.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	Tax the crap out of it. Our (the Canadian) government has been trying to do this with weed.

If they legalized drugs, and put a huge tax on them, dealers would still be in business, as we see now, with prescription meds. If they legalized pot, people would just grow it themselves. The government has too much to lose.|`|rzLGCrlfaa	well what drugs are you talking about if you want to legalize pcp then no that will cause more problems but pot then yes because most pot users are not violent<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  a 6 pack and pcp are a little bit different nobody's gotten drunk and pulled out all of his teeth and fed his face to his dog|`|mvb45FHHaa	That's equivalent to legalizing drunk driving just to get a few cars off the road.<br>  If we allow (illegal) drugs to be legal, then that just means everyone can obtain those drugs.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Legalizing some drugs has always made sense to me.

Then you'd have marketing just like tobacco and alcohol - primarily aimed at kids.<br>  <br>  Deriminalization would let us deal with drugs rationally.<br>  <br>  Right now our 'attempt' to stop drugs is interdiction.   A futile attempt to stop smuggling.   All this serves as is a price support - the risky transport is what makes a bag of leaves worth so much money.   Those higher prices are paid for with property crime.....furthering people's fear of the 'drug menace' and gives support to dumping even more money on the futile attempt at interdiction.<br>  <br>  What Republicans, and many Democrats, are afraid of -- the reason they support interdiction -- is that any RATIONAL drug policy would include medical care for addicts.   They HATE 'wasting' money on people....they'd rather buy jets to interdict, rather then care for the addict.<br>  <br>  Rational drug policy would break the marketing chain drugs go through.   No one is going to buy drugs for $100's on the street, when clean safer sources are available at market value ($1's).   Force people to go to government clinics for the drugs (for very cheap or even free), and offer counseling on the spot.<br>  <br>  By breaking the marketing chains drugs go through....children wouldn't be under the peer pressure that bring them into the drug culture (from recreational drugs up to hard core (Heroin, etc)).    Whereas now we have dealers who ACTIVELY PURSUE new users, we'd then have a dealer that actively works to get people off drugs.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, property crime - crimes committed in the pursuit of money to buy drugs at inflated prices - would drop overnight.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Now your talking!

You're also paying for irresponsible people with that.<br>  <br>  Considering many guns are stolen from responsible owners, maybe you guys aren't so responsible after all?|`|TFdKrkP2aa	I would support it 100%. What this will do is cut down on straw sales which is the main way criminals get guns. It also would build a whole new job sector in the gun rental business. That way you and your husband could rent a gun for the day when you go hiking or hunting or target shooting and not have to worry about it the rest of the time.|`|AA11424005	I believe in the Second Amendment.

If we did, we would probably be kissing his feet for protecting us. Mr. Bush did what he thought best to keep terrorist on their home turf rather than coming here and causing further turmoil for our country. That is what military is for. To protect and serve. To keep terrorism away. Personally, I admire Mr. Bush. He was a strong leader. He made the best decisions he could. Remember, the president is a representative of the decisions made by the house. The president alone does not make the decisions. The old saying "It takes and act of congress to make that happen" is true. The failing economy is not his fault. It is the wasteful spending of Americans and the credit companies fault. Too much money is given away on credit and then people file for bankruptcy so they don't have to pay it back. The economic stimulus from Obama is not going to be the cure all.

Ti0q1Btiaa	What a terrible price to pay.<br>  <br>  You didn't say if you have engaged an attorney on the DUI.<br>  If you received a citation I doubt that it will be dismissed, at least until the case is heard by a judge.  He/she is the only one that can do that.<br>  <br>  You can get a free consultation from many attorneys with no obligation to use them.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and especially with your loss.

You have the right to waive any flag you want, in any manner you want, on US soil.  You are given that right in the 1st amendment and don't need any other document to support your cause.  It's called Freedom of Expression, get ya some of it.
