20090307183123AAErcZj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Cramp like pain in side. 7 mos preg!!!!?	Im 7 months pregnant (29wks)  i have a cramp like/ stitch in my left side it just started today, it feels like when you run really hard and you get a cramp in your side know what i mean? i don't know if it was bc i was moving too fast in my store ( I'm a manager in a retail store) or if when i was coughing after drinking milk too fast i got cramp from that. i can feel my sons back pressing against my stomach, i assume that what it is that I'm reaching the point when baby is becoming bigger....anyone else had this happen...i get kinda paranoid sometimes that something will go wrong.

20090307191545AAyzfaG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Bleeding no cramping... 8 weeks pregnant... Confused!?	I started spotting this afternoon now I have upgraded to bleeding light/medium. This will be my third miscarraige since last January. I am confused because I am not cramping. My last two miscarraige the pain came before the blood and it was terrible but that isn't happening now. I had bad adominal pains earlier this week but thought it was just gas, it went away after two days. I spoke to my doc and he said if I want to I can go to the ER but they can't stop it they will just do ultrasound. I already had a schedule appt with him for Tuesday but he said he will see me Monday if the bleeding doesn't stop. I don't know what to think. I am not bleeding super heavy, which is good, and I am not cramping, which is good but none the less I am bleeding. My periods are usually worse then this. Could this be somthing other than miscarraige? The doc already has me on progesteone and 81mg asperine. Already had u/s at 6 weeks and the baby was in the uterus. Should I go to ER at any point? And if so at what point? Thank you for your input.

Since i found out i was pregnant, my boyfriend has been here for me and taken me to work everyday and stuff that showed he cares etc. We did have problems like this before i even fell pregnant, he would be out every day and night with friends coming home at 3am, he doesnt work, he's 'looking' for a job but i see it as he's looking for a job WHEN it suits HIM. And now I hardly see him, he's phone is a bit dodgy and he always has a low battery so there are times where i cant even get hold of him, he comes home 3 - 4 in the morning and acts like its NOTHING!!!!!!    Ive told him so many times he just tells me to shut my mouth :S he dont even call me to see how im feeling or if i want or need anything and he said to me today that im not in the stage where i need him all the time and that i need to f off and not tell him what to do.   i cry all day every day, i work my *** off and suffering from really bad constant nausea and all he does is relaxes and does nothing. I cant go out with my friends because i feel sick and well who would want a pregnant friend around who complains of sickness all the time.   I dont know what to do i feel so helpless, he dont realise, his friends are more important to him than I am :'( He always says im dumb and ridiculous because i cry over nothing and complain about strecth marks on my thighs i dont know what to do :( help me somebody

We are a happy family of 3, but the pregnancy was difficult for both of us, but now that I see our son growing so fast, I really want to have another. He is adamantly against it, and he hardly ever just flat out says no to anything. Is there any way to make him see how important this is to me that we at least keep it as an option on the table? And please don't answer with "stop taking your birth control and just get pregnant" because it is morally reprehensible, but I also have a Mirena IUC.

20090227101341AASQJVu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby Shower Sadness & Need For Advice?	I did not get a baby shower because MY family lives 3K miles away and there was so much jealousy and drama over pregnancies in my husband's family that caused problems throughout my pregnancy that I was uncomfortable having a shower thrown for me when the only guests would be his family - WAY awkward.  I had not lived in my new town long enough to have developed any friends close enough to throw me a shower.  My MIL would have thrown one but she would have driven a long distance and really her kids (other than hubs) were the ones I was at odds with AND the only guests other than his sister, mother and dad's girlfriend would have been the brother's inlaws.  My decision not to have one wasn't because I didn't want one but because it would have been painful and awkward.  Nonetheless, that this was the lesser of the two evils (not having one) has been a source of great pain for me to the point that now that the sister is pregnant and having showers I am so resentful.  There is a lot to this story that I can't type here because it is just too long and involves a lot of jealousy over my getting pregnant first which is so sad and rediculous.      Every time I look in my son's baby book and see the absence of a shower I feel depressed and miserable to the point of bitterness.       Is it appropriate (he is now three months old) to throw OUR OWN party to welcome our son or have we waited too long?  It wouldn't be a "shower" in that no gifts would be expected and the delay would be because of flu season.  Anyhow, maybe we waited too long.        I just feel like this was a monumental even in my life and it should be honored.  His arrival should be honored too.  Had I been in my home state I would have had tons of people throwing showers or at least attending a couple.  Please know it isn't about the gifts.  We could afford to buy everything ourselves.  It is just that much like a lot of women always dream of their wedding dress I always kind of dreamed of a neat baby shower with a pretty cake and games, etc. and that was robbed from me by pettiness and having moved to a place where only my husband's family lives.      Anyhow, any advice would be helpful.  What would you do?

20090227095026AAXTb63	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is My 4-Year Old Advanced?	My daughter turned four in September.  I placed her  in a private, all-day preschool at the start of the school year because she was so beyond what they were doing in daycare - crafts, playing all day, etc.  She was becoming so bored she was disruptive to the class.       She is thriving in her school now because it is challenging her.  However, my question is if she might be an advanced learner.  She is reading and writing in cursive, knows all about past and the present presidents.  Socially, she is as adept as a five or six year old.  People that meet her for the first time are surprised by her age because of the way she speaks; she has been able to carry full conversations with an adult since she was two.        Does this sound like she is advanced?  When I see other children her age they seem so much younger than her.  Should I have her tested and if so, where do you have the testing done?

January 24th It was the last day on my period (im on the pill btw) I had unprotected sex.On January 25th I started taking my BC pills like usual.

The day after I did the same thing..I did that the next week too, I missed a pill and took two the next day..Then I started bleeding, for a week. It wasn't time for my period So i just assume it was from messing up my pills. I haven't had my period since then. Its February 27th today..My boobs are sore, Im very tired all the time. I go to sleep between 830-930 and feel like I need a nap during the day sometimes. I've been having cramps. This has been happening since a week after I started bleeding from messing up my pills. But as of yesterday Ive been spotting. I have cramps that feel like im going to start my period, But its different..Its just spotting. Ive never spotted before, My periods have always been normal.

Then I started remembering a lot of other thing that have gone wrong in my life and i thought about cutting. I have close friends and an ex-boyfriend who used to cut because they were depressed, but im not depressed! This isn't me. I just started last night, so I can change this right? I'm asking for advice because I don't want this to become a real issue. I didn't use the blade of the scissors, just the pointy tip, which was pretty sharp. So i didn't bleed, i only broke skin a few times. Please don't judge me. Im a christian so I already know that prayer can help and that Jesus is there for me. I just...I don't know what to do. Help?

My dr confirmed my baby is very much head down & I've had fetal monitoring, ultrasounds, etc. & everything is ok with baby.  I just won't dilate!  Thanks

Years ago when Freddy vs Jason came out, my husband and I went to watch it. The place was packed with elementary aged children (from 5 to 12). The movie has sex scenes, vulgar language and violence.    Now, when Friday the 13th hit the theaters not too long ago, my kids said some of their school friends went to see it.    Obviously, some parents out there think it's fine and I'm really curious (not bashing) but why? How can a child so young even enjoy it? What do they get from it?

20090307205401AAIUF5q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How mature..... right?	My sons father has a girlfriend that he's been dating for about 5 months, her and I dont get along, and never have.       Today, I took my son to the beach and she works at an ice cream store behind the beach we were on. I took my son in with me to get some water to mix his formula, since it was the only place close... I was dreading it, but I just figured I'd be mature and just order my water and get out.       I walked in and she whispered into a co workers ear, then the convo goes..      Her: What do you want?   Me: Water please.   Her: Whos baby is that?   Me: This is my son, Brayden.   Her: Oh the one your trying to pin on my boyfriend?      I didnt say anything after that, I just paid and left.      Why do people insist on being so immature over nothing? I dont ask Braydens dad for ANYTHING. He doesn't pay child support, and has coincidentally seen his son 1 time. I just leave the situation alone.      So why on earth would she try to start drama?!       This is probably more of a rant, but it's really bothering me.

My periods are usually light to medium, usually 28 days apart. My cycle from Jan-Feb was 39 days though, I am not sure why. My period for March came on time though, 28 days after my last. But my period ended on the 4 and then on the 6th I had what I am guessing is some type of vaginal bleeding because it was a lot when I wiped, it looked different than my usual flow though. I had to wear a pad. Today I am not bleeding at all but I am having cramps on my upper left side. Any idea what is going on?

IF the mom is ALWAYS worried, stressed, financially very frugal and stressed, is it likely to pass the behavior to the kids. Money is there, but always saving and never doing anything together. Not even birthdays, vacations, going to beach or anything on a budget, just working all the time. Kids not allowed to take part in activities, but just stay  indoors at home watching TV.     Could the kids turn out to take life seriously???? always worrying and conscious about everything? Could they face social interaction challenges??    Its just school and home and that's it.

So I looked up a place that is close to my hometown that specializes in "Guaranteed Gender Recognition" Ultrasounds. They cost $99.      Im due on April 19. I dont know whether I should just wait it out since Im so close to my due date- Or have the ultrasound done. If I knew the sex of the baby it would help me prepare for its arrival better.

He is the one who is outgoing with no fear and always steals the attention away from my shy 4 year old.  It always ends up with him being left out and he comes to me for help.  I don't know how to handle this, I can't just tell them they better play with him or else!  I know there are plenty of things I can do that will encourage them to all play together and I do these things, but they all only last for a little while.   So my question is, how would you comfort your child in this situation?  What would you say to him?

I'm 26 and me and my fiance are not going to have any children for another couple years but my sister is 17, and expecting a girl. My sister's name is Stephanie Jay and her fiance's is simply Shawn. So far here are the names she likes,       Hervan Kate Jay, Noraline Sadie Jay (I like this one the most, but she dosn't like it as much), Felish (yes fell-ish) Katy Jay, Oranne Katy Jay, Kaya Jay, Anthony Jay (for a girl)             And that's all so far. Do you have any suggestions? What one do you like best? Im guessing she'd have black hair or dark blonde (dad has balck hair) and light skin.

20090307205614AANs1cd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What kind of tissue is not normal to pass during a miscarriage?	I just found out on Wednesday that I've had a missed miscarriage. Which is when the body continues with the pregnancy for weeks when the baby has already passed away. I was 11 weeks, the baby stopped developing at 8w4d. Since Friday afternoon, I've been passing a lot of tissue and large blood clots. Just now I went to the bathroom and tried to "push" a little to get some stuff out, and I felt something large come out. As sick as it sounds, I examined it to see if I was still passing large blood clots. This definitely was NOT a blood clot. It was about the size and shape of a lime with a little tube like structure on the tip of one end. It actually reminds me of what a small organ would look like... I'm very afraid, is this normal?!

20090307205927AASPrH3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do you do to train a newborn to know day and night?	For a week now during day time we are told to put the baby in he living room so she can feel he sunlight, the noise we normally generate. We also play with her and limit her sleep. At night we'd dim he light very low and be very quiet. This is to train her to know day and night. We're hoping she can stop jetlagging (be very awake at night and be very tired in the day).       However, this is not working. My baby still very energetic and won't go to sleep. Sometimes it takes me 3-4 hrs to put her back to sleep at 1am.       Does anyone have any suggestions what to do? I'd rather her be more awake day time then night time.

(also if there is alcohol it becomes a sleep over so no one drives drunk)   I am just really sick of not having a social life, and I am not into the whole little lets get together and dance to lame rap music while eating chips and dip.    How can I convince my parents to let me do more stuff.    Also I don't drink or do drugs etc.

20090307215735AApjjN2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	SUPER Itchy Skin Early Pregnancy?	I am 10 weeks pregnant, and I have super itchy skin all over my ankles and calves.  This is fairly recent, within maybe the last week.      But I've had this incredibly itchy, awful little spot right on the top of my head since I was like 4 or 5 weeks.  Its on-and-off but sometimes unbearable, I feel like I'm going to scratch my skin off!  It will last all day long for about 3-6 days at a time, then I'll get 1 or 2 days break & it will start up again.  Lately I've noticed some very slight bumps there, but no redness or severe visible rash.      I can handle this ailment, but my question is, IS THIS NORMAL??  Or should I see a dermatologist?      I've heard of itchy tummy in late weeks of pregnancy, but I'm not showing yet, I'm just nearing the end of my first trimester.      PS I'm 22, first pregnancy, & I was real skinny, and I am now growing pretty fast, (and eating 2x as much), but I am definitely not growing at all on my ankles or the top of my head!!   Thanks  :)

20090307213829AALHP44	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does this make me a bad mommy?	My daughter, Avary, is almost 11 months old.  She is VERY close to walking and has been for a while now.  Infact, I am quite sure she would have been walking 2 months ago if I worked with her at all on it.  I am a SAHM and I spend a lot of time developing all her skills through play and games.  She gets tons of love, affection and attention, however, I decided early on that since she was developing so quickly (hitting every milestone super early and was super strong) I would not work with her on walking for 2 reasons.  First, I have a ton of back problems and I just can't do the stooping down holding her hand thing all day long, and second, once she can walk I am going to have to chase her in the supermarket and everywhere else we go.  At this point she is goint to walk any minute on her own anyway.  I finally showed her how to stand behind her push car and walk with it today and she took to it right away and has been doing it all day. She is rarely around children her age (which I'm trying to change) so she doesn't pick things up from other kids, just me and family members - who I also forbid to teach her to walk.   Anyway, am I a bad mommy for not trying to help her develop this skill and just letting it develop naturally.  (I'm not saying I tie her down so she can't learn to walk, just that I don't encourage her or give her incentive to do so).  What do you think?
20090307222054AAT5Wxy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How did your labor begin?	Does labor have to begin with the little menstrual cramp-like feelings?  Can it be little pains in the vaginal area?  Or anything different than this and if so what?      I'm sorry to sound so ignorant as a mother or 2 already, but honestly....my first two were induced and I only felt one contraction between the two of them before the glorious epidural so I do feel kind of "new" in a sense.      I'm also curious if your baby will still be moving around when labor begins or if he/she will get very still.      Thanks for your help.

20090307214404AAcZGlM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Okay I need opinions on this. Parents to teens preferably!?	I want to know if I'm the only one who thinks my friends mother is crazy as all hell. We will call my friend Kat for this.      Okay, for slight background my friend Kat is 17, she has never given her parents any reason to not trust her. Never the less, Kat's mom is very over protective. She calls her like every ten minutes to check up on her. She drives around town for the sole purpose of trying to catch Kat doing something she's not supposed to. She'll drive by the place where Kat says she is and if she's not there she calls her and asks where she is and what she's doing and why she didn't tell her she left. If her mom hears sirens she calls right away and asks if she's okay and if she's in trouble. Now for the psychotic part, today Kat was taking a nap after she did her chores and her mom took her phone and went through it while she was sleeping. Her mom found out she was dating someone and literally went ape ****. She woke her up, screamed at her, and then went straight to Verizon to have her boyfriends number blocked. Kat is on complete house arrest and the only reason I know anything about this is because her little sister called me and told me what happened.       So, parents, would you ever do this to your child?? Even though I'm only a teenager myself I think the way her mom is acting is way beyond normal concern for a child. Input?

Well the next day i made an appointment with the Dr. and my Dr. didn′t do an ultrasound right away because i was only weeks pregnant.....she told me to wait until I had 8 weeks.......BUT I bleeded when i had intercourse during my 6 weeks of pregnancy......so i stopped and made an appointment with the Dr.....so she did an ultrasound and said the baby was fine there was no sign of miscarriage....!! The cervix was open so that′s where the bleeding came from....Ok...so I went home and each day my pregnancy symptoms were stronger and stronger....so i was taking my prenatal vitamins like normal until my 12th week of pregnancy I started spotting for three days then to bleed heavily with clotts so my mom told me to rest....so I DID....The next day i called my Dr.. and she told me to go do an HcG Blood Test....so I did and my levels were down for a 12 week pregnant girl.....She told me to go do another test the same day and the levels were dropping....she told me to go to the hospital for an urgent ultrasound...so the DR. came into the room and did pelvic ultrasound and looked confused....and said ¨¨How long did you say you were??¨ I was really scared and said ¨¨12 weeks 5 days today¨¨ !!? then he did the vaginal ultrasound and still look confused and finally said....¨Are u sure you are pregnant??¨¨ then told me that he couldn′t find a baby only the sac.....?? He said ok you can dress it looks like you had a missed abortion....BUT he wasn′t sure....Then my other Dr.. told me it looked like a blighted ovum....SO NEITHER OF THEM KNEW?? But i thought if there was no baby on ultrasound then i had miscarried.....So that day i started cramping in the evening and bleeding heavily with huge pieces of clots....and performed the D&C at night.....????Did I miscarry or what??

20090307223118AAaSybM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is he using me? (This is very long and drawn out)?	I'm 15 weeks and 2 days pregnant and somewhat with my boyfriend of 2years. I've provided mostly everything for him our whole relationship, cigs, place to live, food, transportation, etc. When he had a job he never wanted to return the favor. Because I stopped doing as much for him, I suspect, he hasn't been calling me as much. I even pay for the phone he uses to call me so I can have a way to talk to him since he has no job. Feb the 25th we found out I was pregnant and since he had talked about wanting a child for so long he said he was happy but then he starts pulling the no call/no show for days at a time. He pretended to have Strept and when I went by to see him today he was fine. He hasn't shaved or bathed in a while it seems, all he does is lay around the house all day his housemates tell me. But he doesn't call or check on me to see how me or the baby are doing. I've had to go get some tests done because they're not sure that the baby is developing correctly, I'm losing weight each week. I've asked this question a different way but with a little more info maybe I can get a few more responses. What do you make of this?

I have been living with my brother and his wife for years and this is where I want to be forever without dealing with my mother again.  Whenever she is around she's usually very drunk and nasty, but then that isn't very often because half the time I don't know where she is. I kind of hate her *** but the court that gave my brother custody says she can come around anytime. I want my brother and my sister in law to be the only parents I have. No more bizarre calls and no more drunkenness, I would even change my last name because it's embarrassing to be related to her.All I want is a normal life with the people who take care of me and really know me. I tried to write a letter for them but it sucked and I don't have the words. There's going to be a lot of money, time and fighting so with all that, how do I ask?

I am on the nuva ring and I have been doing my reasearch. The nuva ring is 99% effective and the condom is only 97% or some websites even claim 95%. He wants to start using condoms again because he's afraid of getting me pregnant and because before we started having sex i told him that if I got pregnant I was going to keep it. I am not ready to be a mother either that's why I am on birth control to begin with. At first I was ok with using condoms too but in a way I feel weird knowing that someone I love would not want my baby if that  1% chance would ever happen. What should I say to him?

We have to talk about the places as if we went on a one week vacation there, and what we did and saw, things like that. It's next Friday. I forgot to bring home my workbook, so I really can't work on it this weekend, The reason I forgot it was cuz I have so much other homework. I'm really nervous about this.

20090307235213AALKWCM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I ask him about it?	So i don't know if anyone online right now has read/answered my earlier questions, but I'm hoping for better input than the Singles/Dating section, because quite frankly, they suck!  I officially broke up with my boyfriend today, and it was mostly amicable.        However, tonight when I got home, I got onto facebook and his profile was already logged in, and at the bottom of the screen there were open conversations (from that chat feature that I don't entirely understand).  One of the chats was between him and the much older, married neighbor of his parents.  They were (graphically) discussing how they'd like to have sex and were actively planning a good time to do it. They exchanged phone numbers.      Here's my question--I know he would be mad that I was snooping into his profile, but I wasn't going out of my way to get onto his facebook.  Should I ask him about it or tell him I know?  We're expecting our first baby in May, and this woman is married with 3 kids.  I hate the situation for myself, but also for this woman's husband, who is unaware (and they are planning to keep it that way).  How would you ladies react?

Does baby have to be in a head down position to drop or can she drop feet first?      2. If she isn't head down at this point, does she still have time to turn?         3. Is there any way i can feel and see if she is head down?         4. I have been having sharp pains in my vaginal area and bum, does this mean i'm dilating more and if not what does it mean?

Dallas is 8 months old.  he started out on Neosure (he was 2 months premature) and at 2.5 months old we had to change him to Sensitive RS b/c of GERD and as a precaution (I was lactose intollorant as a baby).  This past Monday we had to change him again to Isomil Advance b/c he started spitting up really bad and it stunk really bad too (guess he was developing an allergy to milk this time - again, i was the same way).  Hopefully this will settle him down till I can get away from formula.      I know when I was a baby they had to change my formula like 4 different times and at one point I was even on goat's milk...

20090307223833AATO4yS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Swelling in my feet when I'm lying down?	So I already asked the doctor and she said it's normal, but it's driving me bonkers. It seems like when I lie down my feet puff up and then I can't get comfortable. But when I sit up and put my feet flat on the floor the swelling goes away. I don't know if I'm lying down wrong or what, but I need to get some freakin sleep and I can't do it sitting up. It's actually not just my feet, it's my hands too. It's almost like I'm cutting off circulation so they're swelling. But as soon as I sit up or stand up I can feel my hands and feet loosening up. Any tips on how to sleep. Obviously I'm sleeping on my side, usually my left side, but I always end up crushing a leg or an arm or both. And I have this, what is best described as tension in my abdomen where the baby is pushing against me and if I lie down wrong it hurts because my belly wants to go one way and my baby the other.

20080704141019AABoWW3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I was with a partner for several years and we never caught on pregnant. It's not that we were trying but we	did not use any contraception. I have an 18 year old daughter from a previous relationship and I had to have an emergency c section because I was in labour for hours and she had the cord round her neck several times. We never looked into why we had not conceived when we were a couple and now that I am single again I have doubts in the back of my mind wondering why if it was me or him. Is it possible to ask my GP to refer me for tests to see if I am capable of conceiving again as I am now a single person in the UK.

I'm 9 weeks and haven't had my acrylics filled since before I conceived (you can guess how bad they look LOL). I keep acrylics on because I have psoriasis and the acrylics allow me to scratch but not dig so it's either have a fill or have them removed (which means I have to soak my hands in fingernail polish remover for an hour anyways) and then keep my nails extremely short for the rest of my pregnancy. Does anyone know if fills are safe if done in moderation? Which is more harmful, a fill or the removal process? Thanks!

20090227112304AAVO3me	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I just asked this a few days ago, but...?	...I didn't get many answers.  I thought I'd try again!  Thanks and sorry to those that have already read it.      Has anyone been diagnosed with a bicornuate (heart shaped) uterus while pregnant? I'm 32 weeks along and was diagnosed earlier in the pregnancy. The doctor didn't act like it was a huge deal but told me that I would more than likely have to have a C-section (which is fine with me). We found out this week that I will for sure have to have one and are going to schedule it at my next appointment.      Anyway, I've been reading about my condition and I guess I'm really lucky to have had a healthy pregnancy. The statistics for people like me to get pregnant and stay pregnant are horrible. Also, I've been reading that this condition often causes premature births.      My question is, does anyone else have this and if so can you share your knowledge and experiences with me?

There is no time nor anyone to watch them for me to see a doctor about it.  At my 6 week check up, I got a prescription for Zoloft. I have been taking them but have not followed up with a doctor or mental health person.  I work part-time but I just feel so overwhelmed, sad and angry most of the time.  When I wake up in the morning, I can not wait until it is time to go back to sleep.  I feel like I am just barely making it through the days.  I love my kids so much.  Whatever this is, it is awful.  I have contemplated some awful things which in turn makes me feel guilty which brings about more panic, anxiety, etc. My husband works a lot and when he comes home he is also tired.  I just want him to take the kids.  They have been pooping, throwing up on me me, pulling on my clothes, yelling and just being kids all day and I just want a moment to take a shower.  I just want a moment with no screaming and pulling on my clothes hair, etc. Today is day 2, no shower.  My son has a double ear infection and I held him 11 hours straight yesterday bc he wouldn't let me put him down.  He might be teething too.  I need a break. Any advice?

He's in good spirits, and is eating well, but he's all stuffed up with a cough. The doctor said he's fine to watch at home, and only to bring him in if he develops a fever or becomes lethargic. I saw that Vick's makes a baby rub, but it's advised for babies 3 months and older. Any home remedies or anything?

20090307224455AAkPvUV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Was I a bad friend for doing this?	Weve been best friends for about 5 or 6 years and I feel awful that i ended the friendship.It all started this year when she entered 8th grade (im in 10th). She got this boyfriend who was 15 (she was 13) and still in 8th grade. He was a druggie, alcoholic and always tried to argue with me. We got into a huge argument over her being wit him and in the end she chose him over me. I didn't talk to her for about 2 months but she would still try befriending me again by iming me and stuff. She wouldn't give up and in the end we were friends agin. A month later we kept getting into arguments because of how rebellious she was. I started them (i didnt want to) because she started carving things into her arm , stealing, taking large amounts of pain relief pills, talking about trying out drugs and it all really upset me, she refused to stop and said I was trying to change her. Some of her friends even told me it was "Art" that she was carving things into her arms and told me not to judge her and to leave her alone. She also always lied to me, and wouldn't be honest with me because she was afraid i'd get mad and disaprove, which is true because half the time I did. (I feel bad about it now). She had lost her virginity to the 15 year old on New Years eve, when we were talking about her and relationships she admit to me that she had dumped her previous bf for the 15 year old because she knew she could lose her virginity faster with the 15 year old. I feel awful about this. She said I had to respect her more and that it annoyed her that i couldn't accept her for who she was. She was all "at least my other friends accept me for who I am." But the things she did just bugged me so much! I don't know maybe she was right and I'm a bad friend for asking her not to do any of that? I feel awful because I feel as if I did the wrong thing. Another thing is that my friend whose comp she used to log on myspace had went on her myspace becuase she forgot to log off there computer read through some of her messages and she told people i was her only real friend. I felt so awful afterwords that I felt like crying, since I called her a lot of awful things when we stopped being friends i tried to apologize but she said shes sick of it. Did I do the wrong thing?

20090307230919AAzTu8o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I am having many pregnany symptoms (I think). Preg test neg on 1st day after missed period. Can I still hope?	My husband and I are trying to get pregnant. My periods are usually very regular. Occasionally, it might be 1 or 2 days plus or minus but I have not missed a period in the last 10 years or so. I am about 31 yrs old. First day of my last period was 2/5.      We had sex on 2/14 & 2/15. I had some light bleeding on 2/16 that lasted for 3 days (light red changed to brown) which I thought was due to the intercourse on 2/15 (abrasions perhaps - It was quick & rapid. Nurse told I might have been ovulating. I do not know). I was "feeling" pregnant starting from about a week after the intercourse, I think. It started with lower abdomen feeling heavy/tight. It's like the feeling of pressure or tightness there or some sort of abdominal discomfort. Then on 2/27, I had some thick very dark brown mucus discharge of egg white consistency, which I thought to be a implantation symptom. My husband and I had sex again on 2/28 just in case I was ovulating late.       My feeling of pregnancy was growing all the time. Abdomen feels really stretchy. Gas and burps. The stomach feels almost alright in the morning but feels bloated and full towards evening. Frequent abdominal cramps (similar to AF cramps but lighter. But I very rarely get any AF cramps. Usually my periods are very painless. Only symptom I usually feel is sore and swollen breasts.) Also,  I think I am feeling hungry more often these days. More frequent hunger pangs (This, I could be imagining, I dont know). On 2/6, I felt very tired and fatigued. It continues for 2/7 AM but later I was feeling okay about the tiredness.      2/6 is when I was expecting my period (My period is usually 30 days including first day of last period and first day of current period). Today is 2/7 and I have not had my periods yet. I took a home pregnancy test (dollar tree brand) on 2/7 early morning and got a negative.      I am now very tensed and concerned.      1. Could I still be pregnant (I really pray so) though it is still reading negative?      2. In case I am not pregnant, what were the symptoms I am experiencing? Could anything else be possibly wrong with me?      3. I have frequent abdominal cramps for more than a week. I think I have started noticing those as early as 2/20. Can pregnancy symptoms start as early as this? I also experience a sharp pain sometimes on the right side of abdomen. I have been urinating frequently (But I always had somewhat more frequent urination. It just seems a bit more these days).       4. I am very worried about the abdominal symptoms. Cramping, pricking pains at times mostly on the right side, the stretchy feeling of stomach was initially on lower abdomen. Now it feels more on the upper middle stomach (after the breastbones in the middle). I feel easily tired relative to before, pant more easily when climbing steps. Could something else be wrong with me?      5. Did any of you have these symptoms? What were the results? In case I turn out to be pregnant a few days after, could this be a unhealthy pregnancy?      I am sorry to bore you with a long mail. But I just wanted to provide as much information as possible to help you help me.      I appreciate and value your time and help.

Everytime I go to the doc, it seems that I am left with moe questions than answers and I honestly feel like I am just money to them. The faster they push the patients thru, the more money they make.

20090307155527AA7oiPb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am afraid to tell my parents and inlaws I am pregnant.?	I am 21 years old and just got married late november. We found out a couple of weeks ago that we are pregnant with blessing #1, and are absolutely overjoyed, except at the thought of telling our parents. I know they will be dissapointed that we got pregnant so soon, and will worry that i wont finish school( even tho i definately will, didnt come this far to stop now).  To top it all off, we are living with my husbands parents until we save up enough to get our own place, so we are worried how they will react to bringing a new little person into the house. I know we are adults, happily married and capable of making our own decisions. I guess I am just nervous about everyone being upset or angry and ruining this joyous experience. My husband and I are very close to both my parents and my inlaws, so that in itsself is a blessing. I would just hate for them to lose respect for us. Can anyone out there offer some advice? We got 4 picture frames that say things like " I am the reason for the twinkle in grandmas eye" and " what happens at grandpas house stays at grandpas house" and we made four copies of my last ultrasound to put in there, so we are excited about the presentation...but not so much the reaction.    On a side note, all 4 of them adore babies and talk about grand kids all the time. They just asked us to wait 3 or 4 years b4 we get pregnant. we waited 3 months....

I wanted to write a poem to give to our families to announce our pregnancy. what do u think?         Ten little fingers,    and ten little toes,    A sweet little laugh,     and a tiny button nose.   Will you look like him or will you look like me?   What will you dream of growing up to be?   Our pumpkin will be coming soon,    Her precious smile will soon be seen,    We can wait for you to meet our baby,   She'll arrive on Halloween!
