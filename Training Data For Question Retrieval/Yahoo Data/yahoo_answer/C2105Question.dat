20090227061659AAFSudm	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What is the point of the money system?	It is obviously flawed.  We print money and charge ourselves to do so.  We loan money and charge interest when banks only need to have 10% of the money to back it.  What is that all about?  Let's say there is 10 dollars in the world and I loan it to you.  Then I tell you to bring me back 12.  How the hell does that work?  That is exactly what we do except on a much larger scale.  Can we just squash this system and start over?  All of the buildings and natural resources already exist anyways.  They aren't just going to up and disappear if we put the kabosh on the money system.

I am really confused by this because it seems that members of a Yahoo! Group that I belong to have changed their Yahoo ID's.   So when eMails are sent, they are sent with the header :   "Sent on behalf of Jody (Jody@ipswitch.com)", Then a week later The same Member will send a message and the header will have changed:    "Sent on behalf of J. Ipswitch (Jody@ipswitch.com)",   In this case  It looks like they Changed their Yahoo ID. Is that right? How do you make that kind of change? (those are made up names and email by the way)      I go to My Profile > basics in my profile and see "Display Name:"   How is display name used, because I don't see it displayed anywhere in my profile or otherwise.   I go to Account Info and I can't change the ID: though I know you can make Public aliases:   How do you use Public aliases?   Thank you for your thoughtful answers

20090304093145AA3CrZF	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Problems with Service	How can I contact yahoo customer care?	I can no longer access attachments. I can no longer access my business email from the 'all-new mail'. Even from Classic mail, I can't access my business email with any less than 5 clicks on the same link. I can't find a single phone number for Yahoo customer service. Their 'help' form is useless - the pull-down menu used to specify the problem area crashes my browser before I can select a choice, and of course it's required before I can submit the form. If this was free I wouldn't have so much of a problem, but I PAY for this service. For what?????

I have even reported a couple of obviously and extremely offensive questions / answers. Anyway, just wondering if I need to worry that my account will be deleted or suspended. Is there a specific number of violations that would cause this to happen? Should I be counting?
