But I'll say this - turnabout is fair play, and the Y/A AGW-proponents have dismissed outright anyone who has ever received funding from a non-profit that has ever received a donation or grant from a company in an industry related to energy.    I'll also say this - I am not a "denier" - I am  a skeptic.    I do not state affirmatively that it is not us.

As others have said, the simple truth is that every single time you label Global Warming Sceptics with the word Denier, you are making an ad hominem attack.    And you do that in pretty much every single question and answer that you give.    Lets be clear about this, I *deny* nothing. I simply look at *all* of the data with an *open mind* and keep finding things that simply dont add up. This leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming (and *especially* the part that says we are heading for disaster as a result) has not been proved beyond doubt and that there are enough problems with the theory to remain sceptical.    You use the term Denier due to the Holocaust connotations it evokes and the thinly veiled insult that goes along with those connotations.    Every time you use the word, what youre actually saying is these people who are sceptical of Global Warming who are like those evil people who deny that the Holocaust happened    If that isnt an ad hominem attack, I dont know what is!    And lets also be clear about that fact that almost every Alarmist on here does exactly the same thing and every one that does is also using an ad hominem attack.    So, as I said, you are a hypocrite.    And, *of course* no Global Warming Alarmist scientist has ever lied has he? (Michael Mann, anyone?)

Aenp9qUEaa	Sort out your rubbish. Organic matter e.g. potato peelings, left over food, tea leaves etc. can be transferred straight to a compost heap in the garde and used as a good, natural fertiliser for the plants. Aluminium cans, glass bottles and newspapers etc. can be taken to bottle and can banks and wastepaper skips. Find out where they are by asking your local council or library.      * Use recycled paper to help save trees. Everyone in Britain uses about 6 trees worth of paper every year.        Chlorine bleach is usually used to make newspapers and this pollutes rivers. Its better to use unbleached, recycled paper whenever you can.      * Take your old clothes to charity shops. Some are sold, others are returned to textile mills for recycling.      * Try to avoid buying plastic. It's hard to recycle. One way to cut down on plastic is to refuse to use carrier bags        offered by supermarkets and use strong, long lasting shopping bags instead, or re-use plastic bags over and over again, until they wear out.      * Don't buy over-packed goods. Many things we buy have unnecessary amounts of plastic and paper around them.    Rainforests    Rainforests are valuable habitats. About half of all the species of animals and plants in the world live in rainforests. Thousands of rainforest plants contain substances that can be used in medicines and the tribal people of the forests have great knowledge of them. Rainforests are being cut down to make way for 'civilised man', to grow crops and graze cattle, and provide timber. An area almost the size of Britain is burnt every year. Rainforests help to regulate the world's climate and atmosphere.    Ideas to Help        *        Never buy products made up of tropical hardwoods e.g. mahogany and teak. It is better to buy only pine, oak, ash or beech because they can be replaced.      *        Garden and flower shops sometimes sell        rainforest orchids that have been imported. If you buy an orchid, check that it has been grown in Britain.      *        Some parrots and macaws are unfortunately still        imported. If you want a parrot as a pet, make sure it has been hatched in Britain.      *        Eating a beefburger may be helping to destroy        the rainforest! Most burgers in Britain are made from European cattle. However, the cattle are often fed on soya bean and a lot of that comes from Brazil where large areas of forest have been destroyed to make soya fields. Before buying a burger, ask where the cattle came from and what they were fed on. Try a veggie burger for a change!    Pollution    The air, water and soil of habitats all over the world have been, and are still being,polluted in many different ways. This pollution affects the health of living things. Air is damaged by car and lorry fumes, and power stations create acid rain which destroys entire forests and lakes. When fossil fuels i.e. oil, gas and coal are burned to provide energy for lighting, cooking etc. they form polluting gases.    Oils spills pollute sea water and kill marine life; chemical waste from factories and sewage works, and artificial fertilisers from farmland, pollute river water, killing wildlife and spreading disease.    The careless or deliberate dumping of litter in the environment is not only unsightly but dangerous too.    Ideas to Help        * Use less energy by switching off lights when rooms are not in use, not wasting hot water, not overheating rooms and not boiling more water than necessary when making a cup of tea!      * Use a bicycle or walk instead of using a car for short trips.      * If you spot pollution, such as oil on the beach, report it to the local council. If you suspect a stream is polluted,        report it to the local Environmental Health Officer      * If you use chlorine-based bleach or detergents containing phosphates you are contributing to water pollution.        Try to buy 'environmentally-friendly' products.    The Ozone Layer    Fifteen to thirty miles above the Earth lies the stratosphere, a broad band of gases and one of these gases is ozone. It's only a small part of the stratosphere but very important because it prevents too many of the sun's ultra violet rays from reaching us. Too many ultra violet rays can give us skin cancer and destroy plankton, the important microscopic life in the sea. In the 1980s it was discovered that 'holes' were appearing in the ozone layer above the Antarctic and Arctic. CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons, gases used in the manufacture of aerosols and fridges, are believed to be responsible for destroying the ozone layer.    Ideas to Help        * Don't buy aerosols containing CFCs. Actually, it's not a good idea to buy any aerosols. Even 'ozone friendly' aerosols may contain harmful chemicals and spray cans are difficult to dispose of - they cannot be recycled. Pump-action sprays are a much better alternative.      * A lot of packaging e.g. fast-food cartons, are polystyrene 'blown' with CFCs.

Biodiesel is a solvent and will dissolve natural rubber.  Replace them with synthetic lines.  The same solvent properties will also loosen any sludge from your fuel tank.  Be ready for frequent fuel filter replacement until the tank is clean.  Depending what kind of oil the biodiesel is made from it can congeal at 40 degrees fahrenheit.  That means it is not a good fuel for winter use.  If you keep these points in mind biodiesel should work for you.  If you are making it yourself don't forget to pay your state and federal road use taxes,  unless the truck is strictly for off highway use.|`|uFQFRdczaa	If you have the 6.2 or 6.5 diesel engine already, no change at all.  If not--remove your engine, and drop in a 6.2 (1986-1991) or 6.5(1992-present) Detroit Diesel engine, came stock in the C1500 pickup.  It will bolt to the same transmission and will use the same motor mounts as the V8 gasoline engine, probably the same exhaust.  You will need to add a second battery, you can get all the hardware you'll need from the donor vehicle.  Of course you'll need to flush the fuel tank before you start up, you don't want to put gas in a diesel engine.<br>  <br>  You will notice an immediate improvement in torque, as well as an increase to about 22mpg on the highway--though less horsepower so slower high-end acceleration.  Any diesel truck can run biodiesel, no further modification is necessary.|`|0KmJwYunaa	You don't, properly transesterified biodiesel should have an average hydrocarbon chain length between 10 and 15 carbon atoms unlike waste vegetable oil which has chain lengths as high as 35 carbon atoms.   Unused peanut oil has a chain length of about 18 carbon atoms. Ideally, diesel fuel would be a mix ranging from iso-decane through iso-dodecane.   Kerosene is iso-decane.   Ideally gasoline would be iso-pentane, iso-hexane, iso-heptane, iso-octane through iso-decane.<br>  <br>  Transesterification is using Sodium hydroxide (Lye) to edit out a section out of the long hydrocarbon chains.   This works because Sodium Hydroxide reacts with oils to form glycerides (soap).   You don't want to make soap, you actually want to make as little glyceride as possible so you dilute the NaOH out with methanol before mixing it with the vegetable oil.   The glycerides will settle to the bottom leaving a mix of methanol and esters up at the top.  You check to see if all the NaOH reacted with litmus paper (NaOH is a base) and you measure the specific gravity of the stuff at the top to monitor the resulting chain lengths.   Methanol is corrosive so you don't want it in the fuel but like all alcohols, methanol has an affinity for water so you mix water in to cause the methanol to separate out.   This is called washing the fuel and after you thoroughly mix water into it, you let it separate into three layers, water, ethanol and biodiesel.   The biggest problem is disposing of the glycerides.<br>  <br>  People add those heated pipes and extra tank (for real diesel to start the engine with) in order to use unmodified vegetable oil.   If you do that, the engine will slowly but surely get irreparably gunked up much as an old frying pan gets gunked up.   <br>  <br>  It's a lot of unnecessary work to modify your vehicle for running on unprocessed waste vegetable oil and though you would probably be real proud of yourself for doing so, you'll be slowly damaging your engine beyond repair.
