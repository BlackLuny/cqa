He blames his mother for the death of his father(he died of an aneurysm) and says he wishes she would of died instead of his father.  He now has  a girlfriend but no job and is quite upset and disturbed.  Since he is 19 he said nobody can tell him what to do.  He stated to his uncle that he was going to kill them all.  I told the mom to call the local police, which she did., and was told they couldn't do anything and told her to kick him out of the house.

I have this very rare first addition of what is like, the bible of the free masons.The History of Masonry by Mitchell -1871. My father John Shelton, was a member and so were some ancestors. They built “Rural Plains” near Studley it is the oldest home in Hanover County, dating back to 1670. Sir John Shelton received the property on which it stands through a King’s Grant bestowed in 1609, and it has remained in the Shelton family since. It is the oldest home in the United States in continuous possession of one family. Patrick Henry married Sarah Shelton at “Rural Plains” in 1754. It was damaged by Confederate cannonballs during the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek in 1864 though it was never overtaken.  With this type of history should I sell even though I'm deep in debt? Will this secret society become angered?

Obama’s 3 Big Lies    His Plan to Destroy the GOP          Dear fellow American:       Let me tell you the real reason Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid pushed through the biggest spending bill in history – without proper debate, without Republican input, and without any public scrutiny at all.       Simply, they are trying to turn the United States into a one-party country and to put the Republican Party out of business once and for all.       The massive appropriation called a stimulus – some $787 billion of your money – is really a political war chest for the Democrats.       They want to change the face of American politics forever, and they want to use your taxpayer money to do it.       They want to use billions from our treasury to reward their political friends – and have huge amounts of cash to dole out before the 2010 and 2012 elections.       Some people have wondered why, if the country is in dire need of emergency “stimulus,” most of the money appropriated by this law will not even be spent this year.       Instead, spending will go on for five to 10 years.       There is no mystery here, as the answer is simple: These billions in taxpayer funds will fund the Democratic political machine for many years to come.

I love the new president, he is exactly what society needs, and is a perfect figurehead for the potential changes in the world.      But, his political background, and affiliation with one of the bipartisan parties, in truth makes him another cog in the machine of a government system that has made the rich richer, made the poor poorer, halted technologies, created a military state, and created a tyrannous regime.      can we believe in this change, from a representative from the democratic party?      what do you think?       and I think the short answer is capitalism and greed are to blame, once the champions of the free market are able to set rules ensuring their continuance, no one is in a good position to stop them.

I never really thought Obama would be elected, so I didn't pay too much attention to this, so hopefully someone can help.      How did Barack Obama explain away his preacher Rev. Wright who's church he sat in year after year and even got married by? Rev. Wright is the preacher who preached anti-white hatred, gave sermons titled "God Damn America", "The Racist States of America", and "The U.S. of K.K.A". He is the preacher who told his church that the government created HIV to kill black people.      I know Obama denounced him eventually, but why did he stay in his church for so long if he didn't agree with him? I am a Christian and I have left churches because the preacher was preaching hate, why couldn't Obama and his wife leave? Would Obama still have denounced his preacher if the media hadn't brought it up?         Honest answer from democrats would be appreciated.      Those are actual names of his sermons, btw.

My wife and step daughter are Russian, I married my wife in July of 2007 in Khabarovsk. We have been together for 5 years overall. I sold everything I owned and moved to Russia in order to be together with my wife and daughter. The migratory service there rejected my immigration petition because I'm an American citizen. Personally, I'm not prejudice or discriminatory toward anyone. Before I had to return to the U.S. in October of 2008 because my visa was going to expire, my wife and I traveled to Vladivostok to the U.S. Embassy there and filed and paid for our I-130 petitions and hoped to be joyfully reunited. Now they are trying to reject our petitions on discriminatory grounds. I even wrote to a congressman in Washington, D.C. asking him for help and thus far we have not received any help. I love my wife and daughter. We are a normal loving family and without a doubt, we belong together. I have waited all my life to love and be loved by this wonderful and precious woman, my wife. I treat her daughter as if she were my own daughter too. And now the individuals with the power and authority to reunite us are seemingly trying to divide us. This has brought about severe emotional distress and anxiety upon my entire family. Now it seems that the safety, stability and future of my family is being jeopardized by the very people I thought would protect and support the unity and future of my family. Now we need your help to overcome this obstacle and be joyfully reunited as a family in the near future. Thank you in advance for your support and kind assistance.

If you join the Air Force ROTC your sophomore year and carry it through to graduation, can you apply to medical school right away upon graduation and just have all your service years add up after you finally complete medical school and your residency?   Or will they make you do your service obligation before you can apply to medical school, then make you serve AGAIN after medical school and residency if you go through their Health Professions Scholarship Program and their Financial Assistance Program?

20090220190914AAAMpFB	Politics & Government;Military	Boyfriend coming home from Iraq- what to expect? why doesnt he want to see me right away?	SO my boyfriend and I were only dating a couple months prior to him getting deployed, but I feel like we have grown as a couple and I love him way more now than I did before he left. I truely feel like he's the one for me.      This deployment has not been easy for me. He doesn't know it, but there were a few times that I wanted to break up with him because of his un-gratefulness and his attitude and mood swings. He would get the naughty pictures I'd send and tell me "they're not skanky enough" or "i want naked pictures".. and let me tell ya, they WERE naughty and any other man in his right mind would've agreed. I was sending him like a package a week and I'd ask him if he got them and he'd say "yup" and never thank me... he'd go on facebook and write on people's walls but wouldn't reply to any of my emails nor would he write on my wall.... I would talk to him and he'd seem completely un-interested and not even happy to talk to me. When I'd try and give him his space or see if he needed anything, he'd just tell me everything was fine... so I think he was depressed and maybe going through something?!? IDK.      Anyways, I stuck it out for 7 long months and here I am still waiting for him. I wanted to be there the day of his homecoming but he told me he didn't want me there. That honest REALLY hurt me. His parents are flying out to be there on his homecoming day... He told me he didn't care that they were going and that he won't be able to spend alot of time with them because he's going to be so busy. He told me that he would rather have me come for when he can relax and enjoy spending time with me.       I understand that, and I know there's alot of adjusting to do... but WHAT man in their right mind wouldn't wanna at least see their woman right away?!?? I told him that I didnt care if he needed his space or whatever, that I just wanted to be there to hug and kiss him and tell him I love him.      I decided to fly out the following weekend and that way he'll have a week to adjust.... he will have a little time off to spend with me. I just fear that like another girl is gonna be there... or that he's fallen out of love with me..... or that he's gonna be so horny and bang all these girls that first week without me there...      maybe i am letting these thoughts get to me, but they are there and it's annoying me      Anyone ever experience this? Having to miss your boyfriend/hubby's homecoming??       Have you ever heard of them wanting to be with parents but not a girlfriend right away?!      Do you think there's another reason why he might not wanna see me so soon?      What should I expect when I see him?

20090220201558AAjL2kQ	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this an end run by the Dems to introduce the outlawing of guns in America today?	What do you think and state whether you are a "right to bear arms" supporter or not.      I disagree with it and say it is a violation of my rights.      In Illinois, gun owners may soon be forced to carry $1 million dollar liability insurance policy in order to own a gun. If they didn’t comply, their firearm licenses would be forfeited, and they could face jail time. The proposed legislation is sponsored by Illinois State Rep. Kenneth Dunkin, a former social worker. (Full text of the bill at the link.) It was introduced on February 6th.       What would the premiums run?! If the firearm owner can’t afford the insurance, or decides that it is simply crazy AND unconstitutional and refuses to participate, “the Department of State Police shall revoke and seize a Firearm Owner’s Identification Card,” thus making the the firearm illegal and the owner a criminal.      If Dunkin’s bill makes it out of committee and is passed by the Illinois General Assembly, a whole lot of people, identified through licensing and registration schemes, will have their firearms confiscated by the State Police. This is a blueprint Barack Obama and the bots will surely use to eventually strip many gun owners of their arms, Second Amendment be damned. Hey, it’s the Illinois way!      Gun ownership won’t be illegal, it will just be unaffordable. Drip, drip, drip.

On the other hand, if you don't have any plausible alternatives and you're just trying to block legislation for the sake of denying the rival party a political victory, that is something else entirely - not loyal opposition, just plain opposition.

If you serve in the military, you get free health care, free dental care, housing subsidies, discounted groceries, free food at the mess hall, among a whole mess of perks. Aren't these guys "young, unskilled and not deserving of such benefits?" I mean, according to Republicans? Some of these guys get injured and get major disability payments. I know a guy that makes $80,000 a year and he still gets $60,000 a year from the government in disability. How is he any better than a "welfare queen" from the hood?      Corporations make billions every year, but try their best to get out of paying taxes or anything to the government? Then, when they are hurting, they can go up to Uncle Sam and borrow money at will? Money these bastards barely contributed too, including their CEOs, that use organizations like UBS to hide their money in Swiss accounts?      Defense companies are justified in receiving billions a year from the government working on sham projects like the Land Warrior project, the OICW gun(basically the German Heckler and Koch G36 with a grenade launcher...why the need for additional testing?), the Comanche helicopter and the F-22 Raptor, weapons are LIKELY corporate welfare. Some, like the Comanche and Raptor, were in development for decades! If you can't see through the scam, you're pathetic.      Then the Republicans rewarded all their buddies during the Iraq/Afghanistan War(or, as the I read from the Marines in their magazine, "The Long War," lol). Halliburton, Black Water, Custer Battles and god knows how many others easily scored contracts over there, hardly a meritocracy, and very much a conflict of interest.      Then the Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich, while not thinking about how they were going to pay for this war.      Did I mention the bank bailout that you didn't hear a word of complaint from the Republicans about?      Why do people still listen to Republicans? Oh wait, they didn't, I forgot, we voted Obama in!

20090220195340AAzxOqS	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	A question for African Americans about police?	A friend of mine who is African American recently read the Baltimore, Maryland based book Homicide:A Year on The Killing Streets by David Simon. As you all may know Baltimore is majority African American and over 95% of the Homicide Unit's cases involved African Americans killing African Americans. Anyway, he took offense at the attitudes of some of the White Detectives regarding African Americans in the novel and I merely told him "As a Black man, don't you assume all White cops are racist a------s until proven otherwise." He angrily said yes and that the book merely proved what he always suspected about White Police. So my question is are African Americans offended when they hear White Police mention a problem they have with African Americans and would they rather prefer White Policemen who did or did not explicitly state that they hated African Americans in some way? I only ask African Americans this because most I have come across have a dislike at best and a hatred at worse for White Police. I know most other ethnic groups would rather not have a law enforcement figure claim to hate them but I wonder about African Americans because most I meet already think that all White Police hate them so I wonder with that in mind if they prefer a cop who openly dislikes them as opposed to a cop who doesn't openly dislike them.
20090220201024AAEOAnU	Politics & Government;Immigration	"we could never afford to ship 10-20 million illegals out of here" <what's wrong with my solution?	This just occurred to me. No idea if it's a good idea or not, but I thought I'd test it out over here to find out.       Estimates say we have 10 to 20 million illegal immigrants in America. Most agree, we could never afford to ship them out. Common sense says make them pay for it, but common sense also says they're flat *** broke and they couldn't. So we'd put up the cash, they'd be expected to pay us back, and.....they never would so we'd foot the bill.       Or something like that.       Here's my new idea:      Why not make them work off the cash and then be deported? Make them pay for their own living expenses, if they're not homeless anyway, offer them NO benefits or entitlements, make them wear a tether, and make them get a job where they keep little to none of the money, most likely in the manual labor sector.       Maybe they would make less than minimum wage, maybe they'd make minimum wage, or maybe they would be free to those who agree to have them in exchange for a higher tax rate or simply more taxes overall due to increased production. <I haven't really thought that out yet. But in any case, the cash would be paid to the government and would NOT go through the person unless the person gets a stipend too.        This idea just occurred to me and I have no idea if it's been discussed before. Is there any merit to it? And what are the problems that you see arising from it?      Thanks!

20090220203657AAz9AXW	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	War and Taxation... is it simply Murder and Theft?	Just to make a few points of clarification. War is not the only way to solve disputes... we could, for example, simply remove our god damn military bases from their land... also known as deplomacy. And a standing military does not provide protection, it mearly incites war... just like the cold war, (they have 200 nukes so we should get 400 nukes [ignoring the fact that everyone would be dead anyways]).      But to the point, is there a single difference in the slaughter of millions of people to a game of counterstrike? People seem to think war is some grand solution... no, war is a path favored by idiots hiding behind a desk if was was anything like chess, where our commanders often leave themselves in positions of vunerability... they would never declare it... after all, most wars end simply because everyone finally agrees that the past few years were stupid and that a truce should be made.      So is war murder? Is the act of deliberatly sending brainwashed people to their deaths and ordering them to kill others murder? Is the act of brainwashing that occurs, the murder of their own spirit, their soul if you will, also murder? Is the act of exterminating a group of disgruntled people, or even those who wave a flag of peace, surrender, and ask for diplomatic solutions... murder?      If war were sensible, then the actions surrounding war would also be sensible. Anyone, at any moment, can easily be killed. The methods of war are outdated, troop deployment only results in unnessicary casualties... If we have the capabilities of tracking a person via satalight, laser painting a vehicle from space, and launching a missile capable of dropping a single mine on said vehicle... why not do so? Why the extravagant proclaimations of war? If the goal in war is to kill a person... than KILL HIM, insurgent groups are more effective than this BullShit involving troops and beach heads.      As far as taxation? Tax doesn't support anything except war. Public education? You could do that... or you could go to a private school (yes, they can get expensive, but you pay the money in taxes anyways) Road Maintanince? Try toll roads. fire department and hospitals? Health insurance and home insurance could cover it... you could even have community fire squads.  neighborhood watches for police (which could be supported by charging anyone convicted the arrest and trial costs). But thats only local governments, why the federal government would need money is beyond my comprehension. (except, of course, with the "indirect redistribution of wealth in completely ineffient [polititian caught with his hand in the cookie jar] ways) (side arguing that wealth is a capitalistic value and as such is unneeded. If the federal government wanted to help it's nation it could eliminate wealth altogether... but that will never happen, will it?)      Either way, Just remember... We are no one, we are nothing... time will pass, seasons will change... but that fact will remain the same.

20090220192457AAjQvVW	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	If I was convicted of a misdemeanor in one state, can this be considered a felony in another state?	I was convicted of credit card fraud in Iowa.  The value was somewhere between $500-700.  In Iowa this was considered a misdemeanor.  I live in another state now (Mississippi) where this is most likely considered forgery or identity theft of over $500.  Both of these are considered felonies.  However, I am able to vote and own weapons....so what's going on here?  Any help would be appreciated.  The reason I ask is that I was hired by a state agency here in Mississippi and was terminated because they considered this a felony here.  It frustrated me because on the application it asked if I had been convicted of any felonies and I replied "No" because I haven't.  Is this going to be a problem in other states as well?  I'm currently finishing up a Ph.D program and am trying to go to medical school so this is really important!  Thanks in advance!

Hey Guys,      Recently I've been thinking about what I wanted out of life, I always knew I was born to be in the military, but couldn't figure out if I wanted to be 11b *infantry* or 31b *military police*, with some research I have noticed that MP would be the best path, now I wanted to know. A. In long term is this 6 year commitment in the National Guard going to pay off career wise * I obviously know how much pride I'm going to have doing it* B. My long term goal is to be in the SWAT team, what would I have to do in order to get there, and is the SWAT team I guess you could say a "career" or is it just another duty added to you being a officer, also if I am a patrol officer/SWAT member does that increase pay?

Jasper Johns took an icon with meaning and turned it into a bland object. He transformed a countries flag into a blunt symbol. His flags are very bold. The more you present people with an object of propaganda the more it becomes the norm.    To me these works showed me that the U.S. flag is just used as another tool for the government to feed us as a way to get the people to faithfully back a country despite it’s obvious flaws. These works throw the U.S. flag into the category of the 1933–45 flag of Germany.      My instructor replyed that it was a verry incendiary remark and wonts our thoughts on the subject.

He was supposed to pay me a portion of his retirement per our divorce decree.  He didn't.  I didn't file any paperwork on it until 4 1/2 years later.  His attorney is stating he said that we talked about it and I told him I didn't want the money because I was going to school and I didn't want to report it.  The fact is that I am still going to school and reporting it won't make a difference on my grants.  It's not that much money.  How long is too long?  There are a few reasons I waited.  One, money, I thought it would a lot of money to take legal action.  I wanted to keep the peace.  We were getting along and even talking about reconciling (perhaps getting out of paying was a motive for him).  I was told I couldn't get it because we weren't married 10 years and even if I could get it I didn't think it was going to be more than pocket change.  It's a little more than pocket change and it could help me out a little.  Ignorance mostly.  No excuse, I know but it is my reason.  I read how long is too long is up to the judge.  Anyone know how they determine this?

However, haven't they gone too far!  They come to your house and demand to enter and see your child.  If you say no, they call the police and tell the officer the child may be  in "imminent danger", so the officer makes you let them in.  What happened to proof and search warrants and constitutional rights?  If you let them in they demand to strip search your child , am I the only one who thinks this violate everything America stands for?  Even after repeated visits when they find nothing they can still keep your case open "until they feel there is no risk to the child", when is that when your child turns 18?  They don't come by for months and then they show up with the explanation that "well, you disappeared from our case load, but now your back", yep I feel real confident if a child was being abuse they would be protected!  When you finally get a lawyer because you can't figure out what is going on and they won't give you any straight answer regarding anything, they accuse you of having something to hide and tell you how guilty it makes you look!  Am I the only one that is outraged?  Who is watching these people?  It's like the fat mean girls from high school finally got a little power and now they're gonna play god!  But, since "they are protecting children" they can do whatever they like, however they like, with no explanation or consequence?  They take your children and  and use your fear to manipulate you, and you don't fight because you just want them to go away!  Well, wake up people, if we don't stand up for ourselves no one will!  DHS needs regulations, they need rules and the public needs to know what they are and have options.  Even the police don't operate with this kind of authority.  I want to change the system!  Help me!  If you already have something in the works I want to hear from you!  I want to make a difference!  I want children to be safe, and maybe if DHS focused on the really abused children instead of sticking their noses in everyone's business they could keep track of the children in foster care.  We need to put their focus back on what's important and quit letting them have free rein to do whatever they please.  After all, they do work for us!  If you have anything please answer or e-mail me personally AlaMagenta54@yahoo.com    I will not give up!

It's often said that taxes are the price of freedom, and we all know how they feel about paying taxes.      There's also a good argument to be made that conservatism innately stands in opposition to civilization, as it is an ideology which favors tradition and opposes social change. Of course, every society to ever fall did so because they remained stagnant, and refused to change as the world changed around them.      In addition, many (but not all, of course) conservatives seem to have a sort of hostility to science and rational inquiry, especially lines of inquiry which have resulted in the debunking of fundamentalist dogma. There's never been a single example of a successful civilization which embraced religion and superstition, and discarded science and scientific values.      What do you think?

Earlier today Obama said that he would be a watchdog over the spending of the money given to states and if they were not using the money properly he would call them out on it.      But when some mayors/governors said they wouldn't take the money for their state/city or that they would look at the ramifications for their city/state of taking the money and how many strings were attached to it before taking it, those governors/mayors found out that a loophole was placed in the bill stating that if they didn't take the money within 45 days local legislators could go around them and accept the money for the state.      Isn't them reviewing the strings attached to taking the money and weighing their need to take the money, being responsible? now they will be forced to take the money even if they don't think it is good for their people.

20090220213152AAvKmic	Politics & Government;Immigration	Do U agree with  this AZ rancher disappointed in U.S. support my country let me down what do U think?	My country has let me down." That's the assessment of an Arizona rancher who was sued by six illegal immigrants he detained on his property and turned over to the Border Patrol in 2004.                   On Tuesday an eight-member federal jury in Tucson threw out the claim brought by the six illegal aliens that Roger Barnett violated their civil rights when he detained them at gunpoint on his ranch nearly five years ago. The panel also ruled against the plaintiffs' claims of battery and false imprisonment.       But the jury did find Barnett liable on four claims of assault and four claims of emotional distress, ordering him to pay $77,804 in damages, $60,000 of which were punitive.       The Arizona rancher says he would not have had to detain the illegal immigrants if the U.S. government did its job and kept them from trampling across his property.       "My government has let me down. My government has let all of the American people down, whether they know it of not," Barnett laments. "They might think that it's their right to come in the country but it's not. There's [sic] laws and ways to come into this country, and it's not by sneaking across the Mexican border down there."       Barnett says the government has left him no choice but to personally detain close to 14,000 illegals over the years and turn them over to the Border Patrol. He claims that is why he has been a target of this lawsuit.       "If they're not going to help me, what am I going to do -- throw the ranch away? Back off? ....All these groups like [the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]...there's a Voter Action Network in Tucson, they're just a small group -- they don't like what I'm doing, what I'm saying. And they're trying to put a stop to me."       This is not the first time Barnett has been sued by illegal immigrants. Associated Press reports that his actions have resulted in formal complaints from the Mexican government against what it considers vigilante actions, and in several other lawsuits.                  http://www.onenewsnow.com/Legal/Default....

For example, he said he knew nothing about his radical pastor.  This clearly was a lie.  He gave conflicting stories within a few days to different groups about Israel.  Most recently, he said that the stimulus bill must be passed immediately yet waited until the next week to sign it.  That was a lie.  He said in the speech before signing the bill that it had all sorts of good things in it and no earmarks.  First, he had no idea what was in it because he had nothing to do with crafting it.  That was a lie.  Secondly, its full of earmarks so I can't call that a lie but ignorance and poor judgement when he throws out words.  Did he lie like this to his mother when he was a child?  I have a 13 month old and I plan to use the lesson of Obama when I raise my child and teach him that lying is wrong and the truth is always better.  I plan to use our President as a reverse role model; an example of how not to be.

20090220204628AAhqOpQ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Daycare trying to rob us help! Can I be sent to collections.?	Ok this is the scenario:      My two year old daughter was going to a daycare which we paid $310 for every 2 weeks at the beginning of each two weeks . She had only been enrolled in this daycare for about 2 weeks. She started to come home complaining about being hit everyday. So we talked to the owner about this and the teacher. Apparently some of the kids had been getting rough with her, but the school did not feel that is was necessairy to tell use about it. So after that we asked them to tell us when these thing happen cause obviously we want to know. So the next three days she comes home she has been hit by other kids. On the last day when i went to pick her up she was running around with her shoes untied, and she came home with poop stains, the poop stain thing had happend a few times already. So Monday i go in to find out that her teacher quit and the accountant was in her class watching the children. (now im not sure if she is certified or not but she  is the acountant.) So that same night I call to tell the owner we have decided to take our daughter out of the school and try another school, the owner becomes very angery and tells me "I DONT NEED YOUR KIND OF PEOPLE ANYWAYS" and hangs up on me. real perfessional right? so i try and try to call him back, no answer. 20 minutes later he calls me back and says that it is fine that we take her out and he will refund our deposit which was suppose to go towards this next month and he wont charge us anything, even tho we did not owe him anything. So 2 weeks go by and i recieve a lettter from him stating that since we did not give a thirty day notice we must pay for the full month of tution or he will be sending us to a collection agency. We did sign a form saying that we understand and agree to their policies in the student handout which does state that u must give a thirty day notice, but when i talked to the owner he made a verbal agreement with me. what should i do please help.

I was thinking about buying a useful blade because I do a lot of work in the forest, and it comes in handy. I've had a small pocket knife before, but it was extremely small (the blade was no longer than an inch, and about 1/8 - 1/4 inch wide), and low quality. It fell apart, and is now in even worse condition because I decided to fix it with Gorilla glue. I am under the age of eighteen, and I know that there is some laws out there that I know little about. How old do you have to be in order to purchase a quality knife? I know that small knives, like the pocket knife that I had, are legal for minors because they are too small to be considered weapons. What length is legal, and at what length does it become a weapon and illegal for minors? What brands would you recommend?

Officer showed up 45 min after my car slid into a ditch - no damage to anybody or anything. The officer witnessed nothing. Wrote me up for failure to maintain reasonable control. This is a 2 point offense. I am planning on fighting it - no witness as to my control or lack of control.  It snowed 5 inches that day, no plows or salt. Oncoming traffic edging into my lane, I edged as much to the right as I thought I safely could and slid into the ditch. I was driving WELL below the speed limit in 4 wheel drive.  How can the police officer assume that I failed to maintain REASONABLE control from witnessing only my car in the ditch - no damage to person or property. Aren't there a hundred conceivable reasons the car could have ended up there, at least some of which involved REASONABLE, in fact prudent, control.
