What's your opinion on technology, do you love it, hate it, wish it would go away, wish they'd back off of it a little bit or stop trying to figure everything out through technology/science/etc. ? I think it's good when you need to contact someone or look up information for school/work but then again i think it's bad because they kinda wanna go to far with this technology stuff, for example, i heard that over in Korea they learned how to clone people, omg why do we need to learn how to clone people are there not enough human beings on this planet as it is!?!? And then i heard that it might be a while before the FDA approves cloned hamburger meat/etc. (wtf!?) i don't want to eat anything that's been cloned, what if something is wrong with it, what if it's mutated and makes us all dysfunctional!?

20090203134453AAvMpGC	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	My Nintendo Wii needs repair but i really don't deserve to be charged ￡30. what can I do?   Care to read on?	Ok so check this: 8 months ago Mario Kart Wii gives me the reason to finally get internet so I can race online, so I take the plunge and get the whole broadband set up. it all works like a dream. From that day on, the stand by light on Wii is amber/orange instead of usual red. Can you tell where Im going with this yet? A couple months later I notice graphics looking a little bit messed, getting worse as the days go by. These are called 'artifacts' if you look it up. It turns out that when ever I wasnt playing on the Wii, it was cooking itself (just like leaving it switched on for hours or even weeks WITH OUT the cooling fan spinning) Graphics card now needs replacing. So any one owning an older generation of Wii, know the amber light is bad news and you must go into the settings and TURN OFF STAND-BY CONNECTION. its easy to find and should avoid all this trouble, which I don't expect from nintendo compared to the rushed 360.   So why don't I deserve so shell out ￡30 to send off for repair?   I've been saving Nintendo vip stars sins the begining (when GameCube came out in 2002) hoping I can spend them on something worth while, so Wii Points are just what I've been waiting for.   All my Nintendo stars add up to ￡30 when converted into Wii Points (and spent on Four N64 games) and Wii is months out of garuntee, so this just craps on all those hard earned Stars. My Loyalty for all these years has meant nothing in the way of pay back. Only thing I would have spent those Stars on in the Stars Catolouge was the Gold Link on Horse Figurine (costing 15000 and also equates to ￡30) which ages ago sells out before you even knew it existed. Whats ironic is that in recent months its been made available again and never shows to be out of stock when I check, as though to mock me because I spent just some of my Stars on Wii points, Which couldn't even be used anyway as the shopping channel no longer works unless you update the Wii (to prevent hacks I suppose) but my Wii has been unable to update for many months for some odd reason, I can be waiting 20 minutes then error comes up every time.   Bottom line all my Good looking Wii games look like crap,   Saved up stars seem totally wasted,   and all this because of staying loyal.   Sorry this went on a bit but i'ts very discouraging. But I think I needed to rant about this. Thanks for reading though.

I am trying to set up my Xbox 360 to xbox live using the black xbox adapter originally intended for the xbox. I know that this can work, but I have run into some problems.       Even though I have manually entered the IP address into the Xbox 360, it still fails to connect to the network saying "can't connect to your network using a static IP address". I am wondering if my computer using this address is a problem, but I don't think so because it persists even if it is turned off. I have also read something about MAc addresses and do not under stand how to unfilter the xbox's mac address (if that is happening). It may be my service provider (my apartment landlord provides free wireless internet to the complex), but I am not sure what to contact them about if it is their problem.      I have been unable to successfully connect through the back of the modem and do not plan to pursue that anymore. I am on my last legs as for solving all the problems that I have encountered. Any guidance, advice, or solutions would be appreciated.

20090203140404AAQmfPp	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Wii fit: possible to skip bmi 'screening'?	i don't believe in the bmi as a measure of health and 'fitness'. enough studies show that you're not going to die or be less healthy if you are below, above, or even WAY beyond what is considered 'normal' bmi (I'd probably place above, whatever). so my question is, i want to try and buy a wii fit for the workout, but i am not interested in being 'screened' according to the bmi standards. in fact i'd be annoyed if i bought it just to find out that there's no way around this dumb (in my opinion) measure. is it possible to skip that part and go straight for the exercises? thanks!

I couple of months ago, my scanner stopped working. My printer works fine, but when I try to click on the EPSON Scan program, a message appears saying:  "EPSON Scan cannot be started.  Please use the Troubleshooting Assistant to solve the problem.  Do you want to open the Troubleshooting Assistant?"    I have opened the Troubleshooting Assistant, but it doesn't help. I've gone through all the instructions, but nothing works. I know my scanner still works because when I place a picture on it, I can print the picture to a separate piece of paper. The light, or whatever it is, still works in the scanner. I just cannot open the EPSON Scan program.    Any suggestions? Please, I really need the help!
20090203141125AAWpagR	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	How can I sync a playlist from media player onto my itunes?	Well, its actually my moms.       Most of the music from Media Player transferred over automatically. But some were left out you could say. She then made a playlist of the songs she wanted on her Ipod that never got transferred, but they aren't going to Itunes.       I tried clicking File>Library>Import Playlist and then selecting the playlist she wants on there, but all it does is close the Import window... It doesn't give an error message, or any kind of message at all, it just pretty much completely ignores the command.       While STILL not showing up lol      Help please? [and please refrain from just saying "just use Itunes...we have that already, that's not the issue]      Thanks in advance   :]

Since the last few days, every time I plugged my iPod Nano to my laptop for more than ten minutes, my laptop just beeped and turned off by itself. (Yeah, my laptop is crappy.

And then I forgot that it's been more than ten minutes my iPod was plugged into the laptop, so the laptop went "Beep-beep-beep-sss..." and off.

I bought a Hitachi 50 inch HDTV about 2 days ago so this morning I went to exchange my standard cable box for an HD cable box, Now along with that they gave me the red, blue & green cables along with some red & white gold plated cables, I have the red/blue/green cables hooked up from the TV to the cable box but my question is do I have to hook up the red & whites ones too? Because they look similar to some red/white cables I use to have for my DVD player but the only difference I see with these cables are that they are gold plated, Sorry for the stupid question as I do not know too much about HDTV but thats what I would like to know if I have to hook up the red/whites until I get HDMI cables on friday.
