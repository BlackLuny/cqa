20090130150042AA6lR8d	Dining Out;Singapore;Restaurants	End of last year had this Miele Guide to rank the best Asia restaurants. Is the rating acceptable enough?	what is the standard or criteria to be the best restaurant?    How to recognise the food is good or bad?   I didn't try all the restaurants that rank the top, but some of the best restaurants I really doubt about their food quality, presentation and pricing. Some of the very high ranking restaurant chef, they don't even had a very good fundamental in culinary skills.   Personally I might not agree with the result, but anyway, all these top restaurants had a good relationship with the media, with the so call F&B convoirseur.
