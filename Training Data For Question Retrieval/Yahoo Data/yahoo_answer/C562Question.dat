I was one of those people always not trusting myself to know what’s right, then I realized that no one really knows what's right cosmically or relating to you, for you.  Do you think we’ve lost the ability to think for ourselves, it seems like if you’re not part of a group then there’s something wrong with you? We’ve become the drugged nation, we ignore the cause of the sickness and just treat the disease itself. This is my opinion, what’s yours?

20060720180624AA78MhJ	Health;Other - Health	My sister is 11 years old. She leads a generally okay life and she sleepwalks sometimes. What does this mean?	She sleepwalks rarely. She sleptwalked last night, 1:45am. She got out of her bed, but her eyes were still closed. She walked to the bathroom to urinate, and came back out and got a drink from the fridge. She sat down in a chair in the kitchen, drinking her iced tea. Her eyes were still closed. Then she sat there for a moment, and her head slouched and she started to snore. Then she walked back to her bedroom, and climbed back into bed. 15 minutes later, she got back up, eyes still closed, and walked over to the phone. She tried to dial 751-3185,he number of her next door neighbour's. She dialed 751-6408. Then she pressed the hang up button and put the reciever to her ear, and dialed 751-271396723, then slouched over. I woke her up, and put her back to bed. She explained that her throat was sore, and for some reason remembered getting a drink. Then the dream she had was that she heard a scream and a gunshot from the next door neighbor's. She dialed their number and then she woke up.

Another example is that i was waiting for a friend to call me back, and im just sitting there and he never calls me back, so i i/m him and was like why didnt you call back and he was like i just did and the phone rang twice and your dad yelled at me, and also yelled at you. i have absolutely no recolection of this, i dont think its short term memory loss only because i can usually remember things that just happened, please help

We hung up.      Fifteen minutes later, he shows up at work. When I asked him what he was doing there, he said he was sitting outside of his house and decided to come see me. He didn't remember calling me, or anything that we talked about. He swore that he wasn't drunk or high.       I gave him a quick field test--touch the tip of your nose to my finger, follow my finger with your eyes, and some other things. He passed. So his hand-eye coordination was ok, no apparent alteration of consciousness. He was NOT drunk or high.      But he said he'd been having some "zoning" issues, and other people were telling him that he had forgotten stuff (like talking to them already).

I had ANOTHER period on Febraury 21st, and it is still on. Am I broken, or is this all a normal cycle?

20090227142831AADg8lX	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Question(s) about Hypothyroidism?	the blood test for it, is it something they usually screen for when they give you a general blood test or is it a specialized blood test?       Is it something that suddenly occurs? Can children (13+) have it or can they get an acute case of it and then it progress??       I eat healthy 90% of the time and force myself to exercise even though I'm always blah and tired. I could probably sleep all day if you let me. I've been consistently gaining weight since puberty (uh 11 years ago)...       In general I feel like crap and I've felt like crap for a really really long time. It doesn't matter what I eat or how much I exercise I NEVER have the energy to do anything. I have to force it.. I've been forcing it waiting for these magic "endorphines" to kick in but nothing as of yet!       I have 9/14 of the symptoms listed on this website:    http://www.endocrineweb.com/hypo1.html       I know you aren't doctors but I'd really just like some insight on the problem (hypothyroidism) itself and maybe some things I can do to ease it up some!

I'm a little worried, because I remember reading that that can happen in early pregnancy, though a lot of sites are saying it just means you're ovulating and is nothing to worry about.      You see I went off of birth control for the first time in about a year (so maybe that's why I'm getting it?) But I did have unprotected sex once.      It was with my boyfriend of four years and I am not worried about STDs at all.

20090227142329AAe8Z1k	Health;Women's Health	Worried.  Constant Problems.?	I have had gynecological problems since I was 15 and warning now this is a little gross so don't read on unless you want to help.      It started off with a green discharge, heavy periods, painful sex, bleeding after sex, pain in abdomen, stinging/burning in abdomen. That sort of thing, I've probably missed some out. I've been swabbed for STD's, infections, always come back clear. I've only ever been with one person sexually and he's never cheated or been with anyone else either (guaranteed).      I've been doctors about this tonnes of times and they just say it's normal for me although I did get referred to the gynae's before but they just kept putting me on the pill, said I was too young for a lap (I'm 21).      I've been back to the doctors (seen a new one) and she really listened to me. I asked for a smear test and she said with a smear test, if the results come back abnormal you get sent to the colopscopy clinic up the hospital but because of the symptoms I have she's going to refer me straight there.      Please, has anyone got any idea of what this is? It's so controlling on my life and I'm rather worried it could be something really bad....like cervical cancer.      Any help would be really appreciated.

I could speak fine in our reading groups, but if we had to speak in front of the class I was a mess.  By 6th grade, I was stuttering all the time. I spend so much of my time worrying about school and if were going to have to read something out load that day.  I am so much anxiety and stuttering really holds me back from a lot of things.  Sometimes I don't even to my homework because I know that I will have to read an answer out load. I really try to hide my stuttering because I can't imagine what it would be like if everyone at school would know or even my parents.  I would do anything to get rid off my stuttering.  Can any one help?

I'm 34, my oldest child is 15 months, and I'm suffering a bit with a flabby tummy after 2 kids in 3 years :)      I eat pretty healthily - when I tried to count calories, I'm not exceeding 1500 cals/day. I eat vegetables with meals, don't snack, do have a sweet tooth, but don't indulge it that often!      I am however 13 stone or so, and only 5'0. This puts me in the clinically obese category.       I was born with club foot (both feet). Have had 8 operations on one ankle and 3 on the other. It's left me with chronic osteoarthritis in my ankles, which means walking etc etc very painful, and I'm on disability as a result. Swimming would be great, but with 2 kids and a husband who works odd shifts, it's not possible to get to a pool.       A variation on Atkins' carb counting worked for a while - I lost about a stone, then the weight loss just stopped. Slimming World & Weightwatchers (despite sticking very carefully to them) didn't work at all. Any other ideas to help me lose weight?

20090227142524AAONGDg	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Guys how would you feel if you really cared for someone that has an uncurable std?	I was wondering how anyone would feel if you met someone you really connected with , for example you have great chemistry, you finish eachother sentences, you feel eachothers energy and love being around and talking with eachother. I already know some idiots are going to leave rude comments, but that's obvious.    So, men or women please be honest and not be rude pleaseee . I met this guy and we love being around eachother and etc... it's my responsibility to be honest with him, i couldn't live with myself by not telling him and it's a moraly RIGHT THING TO DO !  so my question is, if you felt this way about a man or woman how would you feel if they told you they have an std ? i've educated myself enough to explain to him about how important it is that (that's if we do plan on making love ) how  i want to protect him , and that theres more to me than 1 negative thing. I try to be a good person, but i'm not perfect.    I would like some moral or even tell me your experience on how you told someone you cared for. And for those people who think negative about someone who has an std, just remember when you point 1 finger at someone, three are pointing back at you...do not judge anyone   Thanks in advance

Six months ago I had scaling done and just a few days ago I had the debridement done. From what I've been reading a debridement is very painful, requires anesthesia and takes a while to do. It also is usually done prior to a scaling/root planing. Mine was not only done after the scaling but only took about 20 minutes and wasn't painful and done without anesthesia. Are the two procedures done with the same machine and can a debridement be done in that short a time? I just found out from my insurance of the two different codes being used and was surprised as both procedures seemed the same to me. Should I be suspicious?

They dont give him vitamin's and supplement's which I believe he strongly needs to stay semi healthy with his Hep C. And they want on put him on drugs for his depression. The problem with that is they could give him anything they want and we'll have no idea what hes taking. Because I'm not with him I cant moniter how he's doing to make sure that what he's taking is actually helping him and not making him worse. My boyfriend has many issues one of them is not standing up for himself he let's other people walk all over him. And I'm not there to help. Im afraid he wont make it through this. He's been in for a year and has another year to go. Any suggestions? The people who work at the jail dont try to help they are all liars.My boyfriend was wrongly accused and had a  really bad lawyer. He shouldn't be in there! But there is nothing I can do.

20070331181400AAiD2Ae	Health;Diet & Fitness	Should I be concerned?	It seems like lately I feel sick after every meal, no matter what I eat, and even if I don't eat very much.

But then the cycle repeats and I still can't eat as much as I feel like I should. I think I'm gradually losing weight, and I don't think I should (I'm at the low end of the healthy range, and I don't want to hit the underweight range).

Solicitei ao médico um exame de mamografia. Tinha 38 anos a época. Ele tentou me convencer que n?o era nada, que eu estava stressada. Após o exame foi diagnosticado calcifica??es no seio direito. Automaticamente as pontadas passaram para o seio direito. Fui ao mastologista, este me pediu para retornar com seis meses para acompanhamento. Novamente houve uma interferência divina, eu entendi três meses, e foi a minha sorte. Com o diagnóstico precosse tive sorte, tendo sido diagnosticado um ca ductal, n?o invasivo. Tive que fazer uma mastectomia completa com reconstru??o mamária. Terei que tomar remédio por cinco anos, mas gra?as ao amor de Deus, e por eu ter conseguido captar sua mensagem, n?o foi necessário passar por quimioterapia ou radioterapia. Aconselho a vcs mulheres  a fazer o auto exame sem deixar de fazer  a mamografia e guardá-las para compara??o. Que os homens também observem... pois o seu corpo fala, é preciso saber ouvir...

I have been dating this wonderfu woman for the past year and we are planning to get married. The only problem is her daughter. Her daughter has OCD and other disorders (excessive, anxiety, etc.)      It hasn't been easy with her daughter. Basically, her daughter often argues with her mother and always blames her for her problems. Her daughter often crashes (depression) for days at a time and is very miserable. She is up and down (severe mood swings).       The difficulty I am faced with is the enabling part. There appears to be an "unnatural relationship" between her daughter and herself. Her daughter often crashes (severe mood swings), manic, etc.. and she treats everyone like trash when she gets this way.      She started on me yesterday morning about my two boys. I told her I was fed up with her waking everyone up (nearly everyday at 2am for help) because of her constant crashes. She told me to F-off and her mom has not spoken to me since.  Any help/ideas?

I got my period as usual, but thinking that I was goin to mess up my cycle, I inserted it back in on the 8th day( the friday I would have usually inserted in on a full 24hrs late). I had unprotected sex on the days following the friday insertion. Has anyone put their ring in a day late?       Is there a chance of pregnancy even though I've been on it for 3 months and have a regular 28 day cycle...I ask this because on their website it says that ovulation takes place within 13-22 days after the ring has been taken out.

She did the pill method where she went home and did it in the comfort of her own home.  Well she passed two large golf ball masses on the past Sunday.  After that all her morning sickness and pain went away.  Now for the past three days she has had pretty intense pain in the region above the vagina (You know when you cramp).  My friend asked Emily if it was cramps but she said she doesnt know what they are because she never had a ruff period before.  They have always been light and pain free.  She is bleeding lightly.  However she just took another prego test and it said she is still pregnant.  Well the clinic that she went to asked to see her two weeks after last Sunday to see if she passed everything.  Could it be possible that she still has hormones that say she is pregnant in her body?  Plus she started the Pill on Monday.  What do you think?  She says she hasnt had sex since before the abortion.  Please no NEGATIVENESS

20081003201813AAT45Wu	Health;Men's Health	My husband and our lack of sex life?..How do i get him to be more open in talking about this?	He is almost 44 and im 40 and we have been happily married 17+yrs with no kids...We havent made love since late february but we are both still very affectionate with each other with lots of hugs,kisses and lots of cuddling..We get along great,rarely fight,are still very much in love with each other and are totally devoted to each other and our marriage...We are both strongly against infidelity so neither 1 of us is cheating and neither 1 of us would ever cheat...We have talked numerous times about why we havent done anything but neither 1 has made a move...Whenever i bring the subject up to him and ask him why he hasnt tried anything his response is always "why havent you"...I guess i havent cause i have been waiting for him...During most of our marriage i am the 1 who has intiated the most and of course he is always ready for some "action" and has never said no to me and the times he has initiated i have NEVER said no to him and i never would cause i love making love with him...Also when i bring the subject up about not doing anything for how long i have asked him if he hasnt wanted to have sex and he will say "yea i have been wanting to" but yet he makes no attempt and i know i could and should initiate but im still waiting to see how long it takes him to initiate...Like i said i have been the 1 who has initiate the most in our marriage...What should i do about this situation and why if he has been wanting to do something why doesnt he just intiate something.      Of course during our marriage he has initiated but i am the 1 who has initiated most of the time and like i said he is always ready and willing and has NEVER turned me down.      There has been numerous times in our marriage that i have told him that he should initiate more often and he always says he will but nothing has really changed so i dont even bother saying this to him anymore cause i figure why bother if he wont.   He has always seemed uncomfortable talking about this stuff so its really hard trying to get him to open up.      We have always had a routine but satisfying sex life but a few times in the past before this current situation started i asked him just out of curiousity NOT cause i thought he was bored if he ever got bored with our sex life and wanted to try something new or different and he has always said "no i like the way things are"      When we met he was 25 and i was 21 and we were both still virgins.      He has NEVER had erection problems so im sure thats not the problem.      He has no stress in his life work is going great...He is not depressed or taking any medicines...He is always happy-go lucky.

20070622043406AA2o9ap	Health;Men's Health	I want every body to feal their back of their heads and tell me if you have a bump very important and cool!!!!	Occipital bun is a morphological term used to describe a prominent bulge, or projection, of the occipital bone at the back of the skull. The term is most often used in connection with scientific descriptions of classic Neanderthal crania. While common among many of mankind's ancestors, primarily robust relatives rather than gracile, the protrusion is relatively rare in modern Homo sapiens.      Some scientists suspect occipital buns might correlate with the biomechanics of running. Another theory attributes them to enlargement of the cerebellum, a region of the cortex which mediates spatial reasoning, motor function, and many aspects of brain wave patterns, including gamma waves.      There are still many human populations which often exhibit occipital buns. A greater proportion of early modern Europeans had them, but prominent occipital buns even among Europeans are now relatively infrequent. They are still found fairly often among Lapp and Finn individuals. Bushmen from South Africa and Australian aborigines often have occipital buns also. A rare occurrence is found in the north of England where the occipital bun is widespread in south Lancashire.      A study conducted by Lieberman, Pearson and Mowbray (Journal of Human Evolution (2000) 38, 291-315) provides evidence that individuals with narrow heads (dolicocephalic) or narrow cranial bases and relatively large brains are more likely to have occipital buns as a means of resolving a spatial packing problem

I went to the doctor in early December because of abdominal pain and some other complaints about menstruation.I hadn't had a period in 8 months or more and my periods have never  been regular.  My doctor tested me for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and I was diagnosed with it.  I hadn't had sex in a long time but I was dating someone.  We had sex and I figured since I didn't have my period I probably didn't ovulate and since a lot of women with PCOS are infertile anyway that my boyfriend could ejaculate in me.and he did.  We did it one day, and then the next.  The second time I got my period the same day.  This was on or around December 29th.  My period ended and we had sex again the 13th.

20080217192445AATUwh2	Health;Diet & Fitness	Are there any calories and carbs in green tea?	People drink it along with there diet and excercise to help weight loss because its been proven to increse your metabolic rate just a little. And since I read green tea is healthy that gives me a reason to drink it anyway. I read on a health website that reasearchers say it speeds up your metabolism a little more and you burn about 60 more calories.       Well okay then. lol But if there are calories or carbs in it that equal more then 60 calories then whats the point. You would be simply adding and subtracting to your diet. bassically what im asking is are there any real nutrients in green tea that can make you fat? or are there any calories? hmm       I would drink it to stay highdrated anyway though. I get dehydrated very easy because I constantly drink water.. and if im at the store and I am thirstly then why not. if there are no calories and im looking for a beverage other then water or caffiene free diet sodas.

I smoked cigarettes for about 9 years and I haven't smoked a cigarette in over 2 weeks!  But instead of feeling great, I never really feel good.  I get headaches every day and I feel ill.  Most of the time I want to take long naps during the day and at night I sleep very restlessly.  I'll wake up at 3 am and be up for atleast an hour before I can sleep again.  I kind of have highs and lows throughout the day of how I'm physically feeling.  Is this from quitting?  Or should I just see a doctor?!

20080924181612AACccYF	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Is There a Chance That I Could Have Diabetes?	I have asked this question already, but I have a bit more information. I am fourteen years old, and my mom wants me to get tested for diabetes. From what I have learned, I don't think that I could have type 2, because it usually occurs in later life. Here are my symptoms/problems:      Every time I eat I get an upset stomach, but I think that it is from my food allergies.      I am usually a really happy and excitable person, but lately I have been getting really irritated with my friends when they have done nothing wrong. I get really pissed at the most random things for no reason.      I also pee a lot. And drink a lot. I can't really ell if it is because I am thirsty or what.      When I stand up, sometimes my eyesight goes blurry for a few seconds.      I get high and low blood sugar. When I have certain carbo-loaded foods, I get really jittery and can't sit still. When I get low blood sugar, I get really dizzy, tired, and quiet. This happens the most when I am out and about shopping or walking.      I also am often cold. My hands and feet especially.      And lately, I have had a bit of tingling in my hands and feet. It hasn't been very often, but still.      And, autimmune diseases run in my family. My grandfather, all of my uncles on my mom's side, and my mom have auto-immune diseases. I have an auto-immune disorder, a severe allergy to gluten, but it doesn't give me trouble anymore. And my grandfather had many problems with his pancreas, so I guess that could affect me too.   I feel like I'm missing something, but I will add more if I remember. I have not lost any weight. Any help would be wonderful. Thank you!   
20080925101439AAkAvk1	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Heart pain and headaches. Any connection?	I am almost 20 years old, (generally) fit and healthy but have had chronic daily headaches (whereby I have a headache everyday) for the last five years or so. I take medication for them and they are largely fine and manageable. The doctors can find nothing untoward and I accept that it is most likely just one of those things.      I have had some, by no means regular, heart pain - they do not last long, maybe 10 seconds at the most, but it invariably causes me to clutch my hand to my chest. I think they are palpitations and nothing to worry about, but an article I read somewhere (for the life of me I cannot remember where) got me thinking. The article mentioned something about heart pain and headaches. I used to be a keen sports player at school but since my headaches I do not play as ANY physical exertion causes my head to spin, I feel nauseous and I can hear my heart pounding away - even at the lightest jog. I was wondering if too much exercise it perhaps too much for my heart and it gives me headaches, through, I don't know, lack of blood flow to the brain or something? I ask as someone who doesn't really understand these things, so therefore I was wondering - even the slightest possible chance - whether these two things could have any connection whatsoever?       Thanks.

Now this is effecting my real life cause sometimes I think I may have dreamt something that seems not real when it really did happen.

20081029051332AAJFSL5	Health;Women's Health	Bicornuate uterus - similarities and questions?	Hi I was recently told I had a bicornuate uterus, I also have an under active thyroid.      I was curious to know how I can find out how fertile I am.       I am only 26 and don't want kids immediately, but would like to know what my chances are, and whether I should go off the pill and give nature its best shot when it comes time to start trying, if the risk of pregnancy is low anyway?      Also my friend was also recently diagnosed with a bicornuate, and we were  both curious how common they were. We also are both left handed, and both were twins in the womb, but the other twin in both our cases was not carried to term.       Has anyone here heard of similar circumstances between women with bicornuate uterus? Or other similarities?      thanks!
