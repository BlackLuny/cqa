It is electronic ignition and best I know it is in good condition.  My question:  Is it worth the cost and effort to convert it from LP to natural gas?  My house was on LP and now the furnace, stove, water heater is all natural gas so I don't even have the LP tank out in the yard anymore.  A couple of contractors I've talked to don't want to touch the heater but if I look hard enough I can probably find someone to do it but is it worth it?  Should I just bite the bullet and buy a new natural gas heater??

I'd have to rent a glass suction holder, and buy (whatever that sealant is called).   I hate to part with $70, but if I break the glass, will probably have to pay that plus cost of new glass.

20090304101639AAtLnkh	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Strange Old Belt Buckle - with Locking Key?	 http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk80/...       The removeable key turns to bring down an internal bar over the tip of the pin (or whatever the prong is called) to lock it down,  Turn to the left and bar goes up and the prong can be moved.      This doesn't seem to be for normal clothing use.  The buckle is only about 1 1/4" wide, and the open part only around 3/4" wide.  Very small belt!      Must be some kind of industrial use. (Buckle seems to be brass).      Anyone know? Link?

20090304105205AA96ZSB	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Is this nice, or cheap and nasty?	I am a 15 year old boy, who has a semi converted loft, which i can access from my bedroom, just as additional space, storage, hangout, etc. It still has beams and everything because it is not a fully converted "room" I have things in it and it is all decorated, except the floor - It is something like chipboard on the floor, and doesent look too nice, along with my scraps of carpet that i scrounged, lol, so I was thinking carpet tiles to cover the chipboard up, and it will be easier to cut round the beams, etc. but, sadly i cannot afford the nice ones. out of desperation, now i was considering wood effect vinyl tiles, but it costs ￡1 for 6 tiles, which is very cheap, so it would cost me only ￡25 to finish the floor. It would be nicer looking than chipboard i think, or should i leave the chipboard? I dont want it to look too cheap, or too kitcheny. what do you think of the idea, and what do you think of this particular tile design. be honest now. heres the link to the tile its the small pic at the top right of the page -  http://www.hotukdeals.com/item/322157/6-...

Carpet store is nearby, has strips and pieces out by trash collection sometimes. I brought home 3 different kinds. Goal is for them to help insulate bottom of water-bed frame. None of carpets have maker's names on back.   One carpet has smooth back, a cotton feel to the back.     Another has visible and touchable net pattern that sparkles in sunlight. Like maybe this had been glued once and later pulled up??   A third has a rubbery back that is sort of smooth, though the net pattern can be seen and felt, and has brown paper stuck to back, looks like part of original wrapping.   On fronts of all three, sculptured pile looks fresh and unused.   My main concern is using carpet that will not have nails and so won't make holes in New water-bed!

I want to install a 200 amp fuse box. What I do has to pass inspection. So far as I know I pick up a socket from the electric company, wire the box with a few circuits and then have it inspected. I don't know how to install or where to get grounding rods. Also I think the pipe going out to the meter socket has to be 2" pvc type grey. Anyone got any other tips or things I need to know? Really hoping to get this right the first time. I was planning on just framing a small section of wall against the barn siding (inside) from which the box will be hung. Thanks!

My boyfriends house is an absolute wreck, beyond the fact that its an OLD house and has dirty walls, a worn out bathroom, and stained carpet, you can tell he isn't the cleanest of people {he was the only one of all his college buddies to have his own house....lol...if that gives you any idea} . To give you a better idea of how bad off this house is, think of the "before" picture of any random house on any random cleaning show... Ive tried and tried again to clean it up myself, but it has become overwhelming to the point where it affects our relationship. We have both improved our day to day cleaning up habits, but the house may be wayyy to far gone. Ok Ok, long story short, my question is, is there a service out there that helps with extreme cases... i mean, more than what a "normal" house cleaning service does, for just the one time?

If you teach using a whiteboard, then you know what I am talking about and yes it is worse than a chalkboard. I look like a miner after class with all that dirt on my face.       I asked the janitor what solution she uses, and she told me just water and a rag. In my opinion, I think the university is being cheap and there has to be a better solution than using water.       So, is there a good cleaning solution that you recommend ?

20090304145255AAJnj9o	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	How can I decoratively organize and de-clutter my bedroom!?	So, I have recently been thinking about redecorating my room. I have every idea in the world on what I want it to look like, and I'm excited to get started. The only problem is, I have sooo much crap lol. I have recently learned to part ways with the things that I REALLY don't need, but that still leaves quite a bit of stuff.    For example:       I have a 5 drawer chest in my walk-in closet. I wanna get rid of it, but then I will still need a place to put my clothes. Where? AND not to mention all of my perfume, make-up, lotion, and other personal items that I keep on top of it.       Then there are my shoes. I HATE this shoe hangy thing that goes on my closet door, but I don't really know what else to do with them.      Then there are my bags. I'm a purse junky, I keep them in a box...but it gets pretty annoying when I have to dig through it just to find the bag I'm looking for.       Then, there is my jewelry! I keep it in a large make-up bad lol...I can never find what I'm looking for, and if ever I do, it's entagled with something else! I hate jewelry boxes for no other reason then the fact that they are small and almost as annoying as the bag.       I really need help here!! Any suggestions? Any advice? Anything??

20090304103414AAby9b0	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How to fix the broken corners on an antique chest humidor?	I received an old chest-type humidor from a friend a month ago, and I think I fouled it up and I would like to fix it.  It's a chest-type humidor, about 10" x 8" x 8".  The outside is hardwood, and the inside has a metal box lining in the bottom, and a large piece of chalk/calcium carbonate in the lid.  When I first got it, I wet the chalk quite a bit, and I'm afraid that's what's messed it up.  A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that the corners on the lid were beginning to split a little bit at the seams, and the lid would not stay completely closed.  I put some books on top to keep it closed.  When I looked at it today, the corner seams have split apart on nearly all four lid corners, the lid now has a 1/2" gap instead of staying closed when I don't have books piled on top of it.  I think I may have caused the wood to warp because the chalk was too wet.  Any way to fix this, or have I junked the whole thing?
