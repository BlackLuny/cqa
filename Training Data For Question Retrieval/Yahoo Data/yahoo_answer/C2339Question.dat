20080226143518AAJQsu7	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Foreign Language Requirement For College?	In most colleges the requirement for admission is two years of the same foreign language.  Here is my problem.  I took Spanish 2A/B my freshman year and followed the following year with Spanish 3A/B.  I passed Spanish 2 but recieved a D in Spanish 3 and most colleges only allow C grades.  So that being my second year in high school would that make me ineligable for admission?  But the other fact is that I started in Spanish 2A/B because in middle school I took Spanish 1A/B.  So is it good enough that I passed Spanish 2 to count as two years or do you have to complete two years of a foreign language to be admitted?

Whacked like a daisy cutter,    I thrash through thickets of fiery gold    On my way to the lure of boxcars.   The earth and I spin    To our own Vanishing points.    Above my head, fringed faces and like mailmen,    Uncles, neighbors long-planted,    Heavy with seed   And the sunfast exposure of plains.   Seems these folks have always been around,    Hulling days in their calloused hands,   Chewing away on longcut wind,      I ruffle their leaves,   Leave a few split stems,   And race over roots to the edge of the field.   When at last i step out,    Exposed to the sun,    Something in me singes,    Curls like flame,    And bursts into roar.

20080301003559AArmaF0	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Wanting to go engineering but mediocre at calculations?	I'm 16, finishing my O'levels, and currently in the rift-raft on deciding my future path. I've always liked technologies. Recently my dream has veered towards studying robotics or other forms of engineering for uni, but I've long realized that while I excel greatly at english, art, or brute memorization, I'm mediocre (no, I don't suck. I just simply won't be a wizard any time soon) at best with logic and calculations. Yes, I can bullshit through essays and still create a semi-decent one, but with maths, uh, let's just say I've beens scoring low due to careless mistakes, and I know in engineering, analytical skills are crucial to succeed.      Question is: should I scrap my interest for technologies in favor of 'playing my strengths', over this problem?

In the halls if she and her clique of friends see me she gets them all to laugh and stare at me, some of them give me these cheesy smiles too. She cuts my class sometimes and I have caught her and gave her detention for each of them. She hands in work but its usually sloppy and effortless. I just don't know what to do. We have a few more months until school ends so I just want to make this run smoothly without her grudge. I understand she's angry, I know I would be mad if a teacher I didn't like  last year was my teacher again. Since the first day I said hello when I saw her and she gave me a dirty look. I called home and write on her reports "Attitude improvement." Is their anything else I can do? She never asks me for help though I do recall a few days ago she seemed happy and asked me a few questions and helped me out with putting papers away. Do you thinks she's playing a game with me?

I got a 5 on this, but I want some advice on how to make it a strong 6 :)Ps. It's a little long, so if you don't want to read, by all means, don't. LOL.   ***   Question : Is deception ever justified?      My parents lied when they told me lying was wrong. Deception is one the many things that is keeping our lives together, like relationships,jobs and how others perceive us, so if the lie is for a good cause, deception is acceptable.       In my opinion, there are two different types of deception : a good "life saver" lie and a lie that once told, could ruin lives. Lies always help me in different situations and to be perfectly honest, I am quite good at it when the punishment is me getting into trouble with my teachers or worse, my parents. I don't lie when it is about a huge thing, like say, a big 'F' on a my final exam. I don't sink that low and besides, my conscience might get the better of me and I'll have to confess sooner or later. I lie about things that can either make or break relationship; these are the things I tend to lie about, nothing more, noting less. I remember a friend of mine asking me the oh-so common question, "Does my butt look big in this?". In my head, I would say, "Yes, it does!" but the words that come out of my mouth are the complete opposite, and I might say something along the lines of, "Girl, you look fierce!" Now that my friend, is a good lie.       Now about the plain wrong lie. It is not hard to do if one had no self-control but nonetheless, it does tend to be tricky. Take a happy couple, married for about twenty years. For argument's sake, let's say, the husband has fooled around with another woman--years ago--while still married to his wife. Had the husband told his wife that he had cheated on her, do you really think the couple would be together for all these years? Probably not.      To conclude, deception is an acceptable thing to do if the situation is not that big a deal. In the name of "being best friends forever", I say lying about the tight jeans is fine, but if it was about the big things that could affect a lifetime commitment to another person, that is when I draw the line.

I was an A student, but always felt like a cheater, as I don't actually think I am smart.

I am considering following a path in:      Cooking (and opening my own restaurant eventually)   Interface Design (I like programming and the creative aspect)   Fashion (buyer, creative head or something)   Psychology (too many people who study psychology, and too young too actually come across professional)      I don't know, I have to do something as I want to build a family in the future and I want to set a good example to my kids, that education is important ^^ But I really need to do something, I am afraid though to make the wrong decision again...

I know that if there is a person speaking you use a comma if you say something like:   "Hi," she said, "my name is Amy."   But for this sentence, I'm not sure:   Later on in “My All,” the vocalist sings “…And yet you're so far, like a distant star I'm wishing on tonight,” and this connects to the idea of Romeo and Juliet being star-crossed lovers. It is like fighting fate for them to be together, but he’s still her happiness and he shines for her like a star in the night’s blanket.    Should there be a comma or a period after "tonight"? I'm pretty sure that it's a comma, but I just want to be sure. Thanks to everyone who answers.

The most important life lessons cannot be learned in classrooms        I do agree that the important life lessons cannot be learned in classrooms. I know by some personal experiences and experiences of others that in a classroom, you only learn to a limit of what responsibility and integrity are, and what country got its flag; when it got it, about ancient Greece. But not bigger life issues that you would have to deal with later on. Like for example how to talk to your boss into giving you a raise, or how to deal with a loss, or deal with marriage, love, how to stay up all night with a sick child etc. These life lessons are harder and more important to deal with than making sure you hand in the book report on time.     Dealing with a loss for example is something that you definitely do not learn in classrooms. In fact no one can teach you how to deal with a loss. You have to learn it on your own as time passes. You can get help from others, but pouring out your feeling and talking to somebody about it, but you wont learn what to do time will take care of it. When I dealt with a loss a while ago, there was no one I could’ve gone to for help and since it was my first loss I had no idea how I was going to deal with it and get through. Everyone just kept telling me that time will heal it. I did get help by talking to my family and friends and doctors and daily visits to my friend helped a lot. But in the end I learned that dealing with a loss was something that you had to deal with alone and the school couldn’t help you.    Becoming a parent is also something that is not taught in school. Anyone can be a parent but being a true parent is a privilege, gift, and a job that comes with a lot of responsibilities. But if you love your children enough, the amount of work in the responsibilities won’t matter to you. You would do anything for your child. Raising children doesn't come with a book; it's first hand knowledge. Something you get better at, as time passes by. Your children will be looking up to you to teach them right from wrong.    Many classroom education gives you the necessary skills to live out your life, it is still somebody else teaching you something that has been passed down from generation to generation. But yet self-learning helped Einstein, make all those discoveries in science. Or how Ruby Bridges had to learn to deal with all the racism in her school. Many people refused to send their children to the same school as her because she was black and this led the 6 year old girl to depression. But in the end she had the courage to get up in the morning and get on with her education while ignoring all the racial remark made about her. She is now a successful travel agent and is now chair of the Ruby Bridges Foundation, "the values of tolerance, respect, and appreciation of all differences".    Overall, you cannot learn life’s biggest lessons in classrooms. Life does not come with a handbook and nobody has all the answers. Of course in life normal human would make many mistakes and that is ok because that is how you learn.You learn each step from a variety of people you meet in your life and you learn from your mistakes.

I will finish studying at 5:30am and by the time I fall asleep it will be 6am. I have to wake up at 7:30 am for my first class which is when I am taking my exam.      Sometimes I feel that when I only get 1 hour of sleep in a night I am more tired and function worse than if I don't sleep at all.      However, when I am too tired, I forget everything! But, the exam is 6 hours away so it's not like I would be too tired. If I did this for my last class of the day I'd surely do very poorly.      What do you think? A little sleep or no sleep?

20090305042308AANKleL	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you please revise the following for 10 points?	The nature of the English curriculum in high schools throughout the country and the world is very critical issue.  The education of our young citizens is crucial.  In many nations, the English curriculum is uniform.  In the U.S., however, there has been no such law in the past.  What students read is ought to be determined at the district level, and ultimately at the level of the teacher.  In certain regions of the country, there are certain authors that are favoritized, the literature ought to be determined by culture (e.g. from the South), the particular education could be more important in certain areas in others, some states might have more trouble learning certain English topics, teachers have their own teaching styles, so they must teach different books, different books are designed for different stardardized tests, and some states might not be able to access the same books as other states, the same amount of books (b/c they have different budget levels).     According to source A, there are certain literary cannons, but people in the various regions must decide what their own canons are.  For example, to Kill a Mockingbird  is a canonized work, especially in the Southern region of the U.S. where racial predjudice was rampant in the 1940’s.    According to source B, independent schools have even a further level of freedom.  Private schools cannot be forced by the district to obey a particular curriculum.  The private schools offer parents a curriculum that they are satisfied with.  If books are homogenized throughout the U.S., there is no longer distinction among private schools, and they could loose tuition.  Magnets schools, such as Magnet schools specializing in English literature could no longer exist.  Additionally, because the percentages of the books read in private schools are lower than public schools overall, private schools have a wider variety of books being read.      According to source F, there is no such thing as a nationwide canon because this would be meaningless.   Because all books are available (even electronically), teachers can now chose their texts.  Thus, the idea of a national canon is invalidated by this widespread availability.

Ok, the reason why i'm so depressed is that I've been rejected to a college that I've always wanted to get in.    I'm really hardworking and have straight As in all of my classes, i've always had perfect grades through my highschool. But the thing is that i've bombed in the ACTs and i think that's one of the reasons why this college rejected me.    So i was thinking of writing a letter explaining why i didn't do well on the ACTs and that they should not judge me based on the test but also look at all my other accomplishments and they should reevaluate my application.   So what should i include in my letter? I really want to sound so convincing!   Or should I even write a litter????
