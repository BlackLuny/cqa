20090226195222AAufHkT	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Why is a C on a piano a different note/pitch/frequency on a B flat clarinet?	I've never received a good explanation in more than 30 years of asking, maybe someone here can help.      I know that if you play a C on a b flat clarinet, it does not sound like a C on a piano tuned to concert pitch. What Im trying to understand is why not just take the note that sounds like this on the clarinet and call it a C - in fact seeing as it sounds like a standard concert pitch C why is it not a C anyway?      Im guessing the answer lies somewhere in the physics of the wave that is produced. For example the frequency of the middle C note is approximately 261.626 Hz - a statement taken from wikipedia. Is the answer that the note at this frequency *sounds* like a different note on the b flat clarinet? And if that is so, why does it sound different? And if not so, why are we messing about giving different names to the same note?      Im very aware of musical theory, I know all about transposing instruments, Im trying to get to the crux of the issue here: Is it strange wave mechanics or just naming conventions?      Many thanks for any help!

My ex-boyfriend (called an "ex" for a reason) was at my place a couple weeks ago for lunch. We had a wonderful time and I had played some soft jazz in the background while we were eating (really not loud, just enough to create ambiance). Anyway, the day after he called me to tell me how delicious lunch was, etc. and said that he couldn't stand the jazz that was playing because it "hurt" his spirit; it was as though he was plunged into hell when he was listening to this. After his comment, I replied "I can play whatever I want, this is my house". He really got offended by my comment and said that I should be more sensitive to his likes. Well, I was really offended by his comment too but he totally dismissed that. He figures that if I love him, I should always aim to please. We got into a huge argument about this and he just didn't want to hear me out. Your comments, please?

20090226202554AAFVh8r	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the name of the book/movie?	what is the name of the book/movie where two parents have a son that has major genetic problems, but a new scientific study comes out where the parents can alter the genetics of the embryo inside the mother after she becomes pregnant again? The parents go ahead with this experimentation because they do not want another child to have the same genetic problems as their first. The second born son is genetically altered in the womb, so when he is born he is very strong and 'perfect'. The first born son is pretty much abandoned as all the attention is given to the 'perfect' child, and the story goes on from there.      I saw this movie a long time ago, and now that I am studying a lot about genetics and what not in school it sort of popped into my head. Any help is appreciated.

As, an American I am curious as to how you labelize regions within a nation larger than ours, in the USA. Is it the same as the USA? In, which there is a North, West, South in turn Midwest, Southwest, Northwest, Northeast, and Southeast. Or in Canada is it labeled East and West Canada.      The country is shaped weird and I do not know whether or not they would label Ontario and provinces, like that as Southern Canada. Wouldn't it be Eastern Canada or do you guys use the term Southeastern Canada, like we use Southeastern US?

It has vanished, and I don't remember the name of the band or song.  The song is in English with a female vocalist.  In the video, a group of people pull up in a van to a building containing military blueprints and technology.  The guys ditch the girl and are looking at blueprints from a vault.  The girls finds a small ball that unfolds into a teddy bear like robot that climbs onto her hand.  Later, the small bear robot has giant glowing tentacles that it uses to kill the guys.  Then the woman leaves in the van with the bear.        Thanks much to anyone that can help me out with this.

My ex-boyfriend (called an "ex" for a reason) was at my place a couple weeks ago for lunch. We had a wonderful time and I had played some soft jazz in the background while we were eating (really not loud, just enough to create ambiance). Anyway, the day after he called me to tell me how delicious lunch was, etc. and said that he couldn't stand the jazz that was playing because it "hurt" his spirit and he felt as though he was "plunged into hell" when he was listening to this. After his comment, I replied "I can play whatever I want, this is my house". He really got offended by my comment and said that I should be more sensitive to his likes. Well, I was really offended by his comment too but he totally dismissed that. He figures that if I love him, I should always aim to please. We got into a huge argument about this and he just didn't want to hear me out. Your comments, please?

The coroner calls the police to show them what’s happened. A Detective Inspector is sent and is taken straight to the first body.      "Englishman, 60, died of heart failure whilst making love to his mistress. Hence the enormous smile Inspector", says the Coroner.      The DI is taken to the second dead man. "Scotsman, 25, won a thousand pounds on the lottery, spent it all on whisky. Died of alcohol poisoning, hence the smile."      The DI is taken to the last body. "Ah" says the coroner, "this is the most unusual one. Irishman 30, struck by lightning."   "Why is he smiling then?" inquires the Inspector.   "Thought he was having his picture taken," replies the coroner.

God will punish him for his excessive boasting and pride, Inshallah!

A doctor, a lawyer, a little boy and a priest were out for a Sunday afternoon flight on a small private plane. Suddenly, the plane developed engine trouble.      In spite of the best efforts of the pilot, the plane started to go down. Finally, the pilot grabbed a parachute, yelled to the passengers that they had better jump, and bailed out.      Unfortunately, there were only three parachutes remaining.       The doctor grabbed one and said "I'm a doctor, I save lives, so I must live," and jumped out.      The lawyer then said, "I'm a lawyer and lawyers are the smartest people in the world. I deserve to live."       He also grabbed a parachute and jumped.      The priest looked at the little boy and said, "My son, I've lived a long and full life. You are young and have your whole life ahead of you. Take the last parachute and live in peace."      The little boy handed the parachute back to the priest and said, "Not to worry, Father. The 'smartest man in the world' just took off with my back pack.   "

Ok well I guess I've been kind of in the writing mood lately.   Anywho, what do you think of this last song I wrote?   idk it kind of seems like more of a (badly written/mediocre) poem to me o.O   but whatever   tell me if you think it's any good please.   I could really use the constructive criticism.   I think I'll call it Quicksand *shrugs*               Quicksand:      Into the quicksand once again   only this time I'm staring right at it   I'm walking right into it   getting sucked in   unable to care   unable to stop it      down, down, down   until I'm completely lost in it   can't see anything but you (no, nothing but you)      I have to get out   I have to get free   why won't you let me?   I need something else.   something certain. something stable.   something I can depend on.      down, down, down   until I'm completely lost in it   can't see anything but you (no, nothing but you)      I don't know what's going on.   and I probably never will.   but can't you at least clue me in?      I don't want your lies.   I don't need your games.   I just need the truth.   But I guess it's too late.   I'm already in quicksand...         suggestions? comments? praise? criticism?
20090226215741AAb5Ez7	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Can anyone give me their opinion of a song I recently wrote? Rate it and whatnot please?	Ok here's another "song." (if you can really call it that)      Whatever. I am terrible at writing but I read this quote that said "I remember every word you ever told me (I can't stop thinking about it) so keep talking. Because I'm so scared you'll stop" and then this little thing kind of popped into my head.   Would you guys be so kind as to tell me your opinion of it? and whether you think it's any good (or horribly wrong)         *oh and the part in brackets is something that I wasn't sure if I should keep in there. could you tell me if I should leave that part in as well? thanks      Here it is (and tell me how I could fix it please):      I remember every word you ever told me   (I can't stop thinking about it)   so keep talking   because I'm so scared you'll stop      yeah so keep on. keep on.   things will never be the way I want them to be   they'll never be perfect   but maybe that's how it's meant to be.      so keep on talking   [whispering your sweet nothings?]   because I'm so scared you'll stop.   (so scared, so scared)      so scared you'll leave.   so scared you'll disappear.   and I can't even begin to describe   the way the hole in my chest feels   the way every breath aches with your memory   bu that's all a part of the game isn't it?   the hole in me. the pain. the loss.      so just keep talking.   don't stop.   don't ever stop...      Also I was considering switching the last "the loss" with "this empty feeling"   ehh I know it's a typical angsty, teenager-ish thing to write but eh it popped into my head and I haven't revised it or given it a second thought. so I'm counting on YOU guys to help me with that ;)   thanks I appreciate it :D

20090226215034AA32iQ7	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Good riddle. Please star if you like it....................?	Mr Smith has lots of pennies, ten boxes in all. Each box contains 100 pennies, but one box contains coins which are all counterfeit and are slightly lighter, 1/16 of an ounce lighter to be exact. The problem lies in the fact that they all look identical, the only way to tell them apart is to weigh them. Mr Smith knows the correct weight for a box, but how many weighings are required to determine which box contains the counterfeit ones?

Endure before you question, you wicked flower   Dream of hypocrisy, stare at those wary eyes. Purities and faults, no longer discernible   The light fades, and like a babe, you sleep within the womb of darkness. Solitude is your true love, perhaps your only ally   Each and every one of you, bathed in blood, born into these times. O chosen princes, fighting composes your banquet   Ahh, I am the all-beautiful and omnipotent, mother of love, who gave birth to you. Yet are my breasts nourishing brethren of Hell?   The mark of revelations, what then is the truth behind it? You do not even attempt to fathom and bury them, the seeds of hidden deeds   Double-edged sword, draw your sword at the sword directed at you. And only believe in what you need to protect       Please don't just say.. " idk.. "       Thanks. :)

So now I'm wondering if the way I hold my pic messes up my angle or something when I play. Either I'm doing something wrong (Which I doubt because I've played with pinch harmonics a bunch of times before) Or if IS because of my thumb.

20090225105136AAcX3ji	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why is sun-sign compatibility still an accepted norm?	I was just wondering; a lot of websites offer your astrological compatibility based on your sun signs only. Even here on Yahoo!Answers, there are a lot of answerers who stick to the idea that certain sun signs will just never be able to have a good romantic relationship; based solely on their sun signs.      I've been studying astrology for a while now, and it seems to me that compatibility can just NEVER be based solely on the sun signs of two people. Even if you look at astrological compatibility exclusively, there is still the whole birthchart that can make a difference, not just the sun sign. I've also seen plenty of other answers confirm this.      In fact, I'm Taurus and my man is Aries and we have a great relationship - better than the relationship I had with my Capricorn match. When in fact Capricorn is supposed to be my "perfect match", and Aries is supposed to be "not for Taurus".       So why is sun sign compatibility still the main thing discussed, and the main thing on websites? When there's so many more signs influencing you? Why are there still answers like "Capricorn and Gemini are a bad match" when we all know that there are a lot of Capricorn/Gemini couples out there, very possibly with healthy relationships? Why is compatibility purely based on sun signs still the accepted norm when it's such an incomplete evaluation?      NOTE: If you don't believe in astrology, don't answer. I will successfully report your answer as spam, because you didn't answer my particular question, you just gave a random a$$ opinion I didn't ask for. Go play somewhere else if you don't like astrology.

What happens is that me and a witness stay in the room and I point to any of the objects. The person who is "mind reading" then comes back into the room afterward and asks me 3-5 seemingly random questions. (They're questions about my middle name, shoe size, where I'm from, etc.). I respond to the questions but he still guesses the object correctly every time even when I switchup the objects. And it does not have to do with the witness giving a tell because I made sure that it couldn't be that.      Can anyone help me out? Perhaps you've seen a variation of a game like this.

I think it should have been.      2.This one dawned on me...but doesn't this new version remind all of my old school people how much it is like the original movie...All Spark=The Matrix?  People who have seen the ORIGINAL movie will know what I mean.        BTW...THAT MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!

20090226164317AAGjPbG	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Whats a good song for letting go?	i have loved one guy for over three years. we were best friends for a long time, and i have never been closer to anyone than i was to him. i never told him how i really felt about him for fear of ruining our friendship. about 8 months ago, he told me that he has had feelings for me for almost as long as i have for him. so we started a dating relationship, and every day i fell deeper and deeper in love with him. we went through alot of rocky times, and split up several times, but always got back together. each time it hurt worse than the last, but then when we got back together we seemed to be stronger and more devoted to eachother, but it never lasted. recently we decided that we are better just as friends, but there was alot of distance piut between us because of all our splits. so we agreed to just work at it and try to build our friendship up again. he has texted me and told me how much he misses being close like we were before we ever got together, and how he wants to be my best friend again and i mean more to him than anything. however, he has started becoming close with another girl. not close like he has feelings for her, but close like he and i used to be. and he doesnt seem to care at all that it is killing me to be losing my best friend, the one person that i trusted completely and thot i had a special bond with. lately hes been treating me like dirt, and he doesnt seem to care at all. he had to drive a long distance the other day, and i asked him to let me know when he got there so i would know hes ok. he hasnt sed a word to me, but i know he got there because, of course, he had plenty of time to talk to the other girl (who is one of my friends). but not time to even send me one text message just saying he got there ok. things like this happened all throughout the time we were together, and it breaks my heart that the friendship we had was not as special as i thought it was. so im done. im done waiting for him and doing everything i can to be there for him, only to have him ignore me and break my heart over and over. im not really looking for any "girl-power" or "independent"-type songs, just something kindof bittersweet about letting go. thanks everyone

20090128095043AAJLmDP	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Do you think this joke is funny? (post your own in response)?	lol i like it tho it kinda shocked me       A Touching Elephant Story       In 1986, Dan Harrison was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Northwestern University .      On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Dan approached it very carefully.      He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.      As carefully and as gently as he could, Dan worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.       The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments.      Dan stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.      Dan never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.      ---      Twenty years later, Dan was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenage son.      As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Dan and his son Dan Jr. were standing.      The large bull elephant stared at Dan, lifted its front foot off the ground, and then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.      Remembering the encounter in 1986, Dan couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.      Dan summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Dan's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.      Probably wasn't the same elephant....
20090225124417AAt5qjR	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	RHH: Do the "Hip Hop is dead" brigade have it twisted?	Simply because...(and correct me on this, I'm no hip hop historian).      Hip hop was initially turntablism and breaking...But people make out like the first and second waves of MC's were super lyrical and had nothing but socially and politically charged lyrics.      To me..That's like saying Rock and Roll started with Progressive Rock or that Jazz started with Free Jazz..      Lastly...Is it me or do the majority of the "Bring Back The 90's!" brigade seem like they weren't even alive in hip hop's "Golden Age".?      Where do hip hop's roots stem from (TO YOU)? and what type of hip hop best represents the genre?

I know metal has a ton of genres and it took me a while to find the genre that i like. When i really started to get into music i always knew i had a taste for classical music, but i didn't know anything about it. I tried listening to some stuff on the radio, but it just wasn't something i enjoyed. A couple of days ago i was talking to an online friend and she told me about a band she liked, and i was like "wow...this is amazing." It was exactly what i've been searching for.        http://www.myspace.com/nachtreich       I know they're neo-classical black metal band and not all of their music is like that. What genre of classical music is that? Are there even a bunch of genres of classical music just like metal?

When I found Terry Riley's "In C" available under a Creative Commons license at  http://imslp.org/wiki/In_C_(Riley,_Terry...  I was really excited because I wanted my community band to try playing it sometime. However, I quickly realized that not everyone is as facile at transposing from C as I am, so I went looking for transposed versions online -- and met with echoing silence.      Does anyone know where I can find versions of "In C" in the various keys appropriate to concert band? If I have to write it out by hand, I will, but my musical handwriting was atrocious when I was _in_ practice. (Ideally, I'd like to find a Lilypond source file for it, and then just transpose from that.)
