20090225142536AAe8Z2w	Local Businesses;United States;Other - US Local Businesses	I think I have been scammed.....?	I recently went to a reception hall because I am planning my daughter's quinceanera. I talked to a lady who says she works for a party planning company and they work with many different reception halls throughout southern california. She  seemed legit. So when she told me to meet her at her office a few days later to write up the contract I did. Her office was in a strange location and looked like an apartment but I didn't think anything of it at the time, she was nice and showed us some decorating ideas and what not and we signed the contract and gave her a deposit. We later checked the business licensing number on the contract and it came up the business license for a construction company. We are having a very hard time getting a hold of her and her only phone number is a cell phone number. How can I find out if this is a scam or a legitimate business?

The package would infuse cash into money-losing companies by allowing them to claim tax credits on past profits dating back five years instead of two. It also would offer bonus depreciation for businesses investing in new plants and equipment; double the amount small businesses can write off for capital investments and new equipment purchases; allow businesses to claim a tax credit for hiring youths and veterans.
