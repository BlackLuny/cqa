00f5beb3d6ecc198b23cb6409819685aaa	NEVER aim down with the shotgun. You will be an easy and immobile target for the other person. And yes, always use it in close range. Long range and it is useless. The pistol is not crap like in most games. If you aim for the head and if you shoot fast enough, you can do good damage. And there are not many glitches. There is one where you can roadie run and shoot at the same time, but not that. You can get a one shot kill with a shotgun easily if you are close enough, or if you get a head shot. Also, roll around as much as you can during a shotgun firefight. It makes you much harder to shoot and can help you flee or regenerate.|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	If they are really far away like you say, they cant be using the shotgun. The shotgun is meant for short range combat. They are probally using the sniper rifle. You can easily line up head shots with it.

61e2909073bd9338f2326d3ce2692144aa	Mmmm... es un milagro que hayas llegado tan lejos, mira la escopeta de nombre "Striker", es la mejor opción, al alterarla al maximo, puedes obtener la habilidad de poseer hasta 100 balas en el cargador, es muy buena opcion, y la mas poderosa de todas las escopetas, la escuadra "Killer 7", es una opcion terrible, realmente no te hubiese convenido, no tiene capacidad de alterarse al maximo, de forma esclusiva, osea que no tiene mucha habilidad la mejor opcion es conservar la "Broken Butterfly", esta es el arma comun mas poderosa, al alterarse al maximo de forma esclusiva, obtiene un radio de 50% de radio, realmente poderosa, y solo deberias utilizarla con enemigos poderosos, como Jack Krauser, Salazar, o Saddler, e iunclusive acaba con tipos de metrelleta con pocos tiros hacia la cabeza, a los "Garridors", los mata con un solo tiro en su punto debil en la espalda, o los "Gigante", la "Blacktail", no es tan mala opcion, es buena, de hecho es la que mas rapido dispara, y carga con mas balas, sin embargo, la opcion mas recomendable es la "Red 9", es la mas poderosa y efectiva, es casi infalible, alterada de forma esclusiva es la mas poderosa de las handguns...<br>  Bueno, al monstruo de los vagones, o como se le conoce por Saddler, "It"... Al principio cuando caes hacia los contenedores, es necesario que no gastes municion en el, simplemente ignoralo, esquiva sus ataques presionando correctamente la secuencia de los botones, que aparecen en tu pantalla, dentro de los contenedores, tienes que encontrar, la forma de abrir camino hacia las consolas para desactivarlas, tienes que destruir los interruptores de color verde para poder acceder a ellas... Cuando logres escapar de los contenedores, ahora si se viene la parte de pelear con el, al principio, entra cerca de la cueva, y cierra la reja, esto no lo detendra por mucho tiempo asi, que, cuando intente destruir la(s) reja(s), disparale al(los) contenedor(es) de explosivos de color rojo, esto lo da?a de forma considerable, la mejor opcion para matarlo, es con la "Broken Butterfly", en tu caso, con la "Killer 7", tambien utiliza granadas explosivas, o incendiarias, para acabar con el, tambien utiliza la escopeta, o el rifle, pero con precausion, esquiva sus ataques, pero con cuidado, ya que es muy rapido... repite el proceso para destrurilo...<br>  A los monstruos de nombre "Regenerators", sin la mira termica es algo complicado de destrurirlos, asi que intenta diprarles con lo mas fuerte en tu armamento, e intenta huir de ellos, es la mejor opcion en tu caso, disparales en las piernas, e intenta atacarlos con el cuchillo, es un metodo efectivo, peligroso, pero efectivo, tambien es un proceso lento... ten mucho cuidado de ellos... en especial si vienes en compa?ia de Ashley...<br>  Bueno suerte y saludos... Y si, ten mello, ten mucho mello, que se pone pior... Te faltan los minijuegos, "The Mercenaries", y "Assigment Ada", y el modo profesional, que es mas complicado...|`|739828c445ed8d72a3eb8243a82d6d4baa	mira de un principio debiste que agarrar la mira por que si no lo matas rapido pero puedes matarlo disparandole siempre en la cabeza o sino avientales granadas de fuego o si no encierralos en los cuartos con celdas de esos que se abren con las palancas y eso es todoespero que esto te ayude|`|IGoZZwEwaa	Creo que te refieres al U3 (o "eso" como lo llama Saddler) es el que aparece despues de que enfrentas por primera vez a Krauser, la primera parte de la pelea no lo puedes matar, solo tienes que ir escapando de los contenedores que se caen y estarlo esquivando con la combinacion de botones, puedes usar granadas flash para destantearlo si te llega a acorralar, estudia tu mapa para que veas donde estan las salidas de cada contenedor, estan marcadas de rojo.<br>  <br>  El ultimo contenedor es un poco mas dificil, aqui le sale una como pinza al mono este, cuando quiera pegar con ella corre hacia el lado de el y lo esquivaras muy facil y mientras se voltea puedes ganar espacio, si se llega a poner muy pesado puedes darle un tiro de magnum para que se tranquilice.<br>  <br>  Cuando escapas del contenedor y avanzas un poco, el U3 regresa por la revancha, aqui una estrategia para vencerlo e correr hacia el fondo y abrir la reja, pasar y cerrarla, asi se distrae un rato y puedes vaciarle tu magnum y usar hand granades, tambien se pueden usar los barriles de gasolina que estan por ahi; habra veces en las que se enterrara en el suelo y usara su pinza para atacar, solo hay que esquivarlo con la combinacion de botones, si destruye la dos rejas solo tienes que mantenerte en movimiento y disparando en cada oportunidad. <br>  <br>  Para acabar con los Regenerators (los esos como zombis que respiran bien gacho) se necesita forzosamente la mira infrarroja que se obtiene en la camara frigorifica, ya que como se regeneran toma muchisima municion matarlos; te recomiendo las granadas incendiarias, ya que les hacen mucho da?o y dispararles moderadamente con armas potentes, pero va a tomar mucho tiempo y balas. Si puedes esquivarlos, no lo dudes, lo mejor es una flash granade. Un amigo me dijo que con el cuchillo tambien los puedes matar y mas rapido, pero es dificil acercarceles.<br>  <br>  No quiero decirte que sigue, por que se arruinaria la esencia del juego, nada mas te adelanto que tienes otra pelea, nada dificil; luego ya llega por fin el apoyo y de ahi a la batalla final.<br>  <br>  Vas bien con la Striker, trata de maximizarla al tope, es buena escopeta, no se puede decir que la mejor por el hecho de que tienes que disparar muy cerca del enemigo para hacerle da?o serio, pero el hecho de no estarla recargando a cada rato es muy bueno cuando te estan rodeando los malos.<br>  <br>  Yo te recomendaria la Broken Butterfly en vez de la Killer7, ya que maximizada a tope te da 50 de poder de fuego, lo cual la verdad es muy util, tambien vas bien con la Blacktail, se apunta mas rapido y tiene muy buena potencia.<br>  <br>  Espero que esto te ayude, yo uso la version de PS2; como mecionaste disco 2, creo que tu usas la del cubo, aunque tengo entendido que no tienen diferencia.<br>  <br>  Animo, que ya te falta poco para acabarlo !!!|`|2a4e91920219104601aaafd7c7f8def6aa	al moustro de los vagones no lo puedes matar ahi, solo escapa de el antes de que se te acabe el tiempo<br>  <br>  de los moustros con espinas es forzosa la mira lazer, comprala no es tan cara.|`|5nZv40D4aa	Pues solo tira los vagones y ya ahi dale con tu bazooka.<br>  <br>  ?Final? no mijita, ya mero matas a Sadler, pero no es el final, te falta el Assignament Ada, los mercenarios y la dificultad professional.......Chavita, vas a la mitad.......|`|pro95WGKaa	ya no creo ke te salgan mas de los zombis de picos, <br>  <br>  a ese jefe no lo puedes matar hasta que salgas de los vagones, busca la salida de cada vagon, y cuando tires todos ya podras matarlo.<br>  <br>  Ya vas al final, te falta Krauser y Sadler, de ganar depende de las municiones ke traigas, y como juegues, no desesperes ya te falta poko.<br>  <br>  ya no gastes sprays de curacion, guardalos para el final.|`|2S22GeWfaa	mira    en  el  vagon    no lo tienes que  matar   solo   tienes que  avrir las compuertas   estas entan  marcadas  en unos focos  azules   o rojos   y tienes  que  ir  buscando   las  dos  por  cada  vagon    y asi  salir   <br>  <br>  <br>  referente a lso  monutros  de  espinas    trata de darles en el corazon   despues en la pierna para que  sa  caigan  y     ya en el suelo   dales   en  el corazon  pero en la parte de atras  pero no te aserque mucho.|`|33a65cd9406efd9fdf29b015d82a8379aa	si es el que parece un punk como el de +44, no lo mates en los vagones esperate a salir de ellos te acercas al final a un gancho y saltas avanzas y ahi se te vuelve a aparecer y ahi es donde lo debes de matar.

Sinceramente te llevará mucho tiempo, ya que tendrás que conseguir amigos y desarrollar habilidades (Que conseguirás comprando algunos objetos, por medio del sueldo que te da tu empleo). Tal vez te divierta bastante, si buscas una misión u objetivo. Porque si juegas el juego con trucos como el del dinero, no le encontrarás una dificultad y será muy aburrido. También te recomiendo que instales más expansiones, o que instales Los Sims 2, para divertirte aun más. Suerte y Saludos!|`|f3dfb7de9db89905901051399c42dccfaa	no solo no hay objetivo, sino que nunca ganas, te re concentras para que todo salga bien, pero siempre algo sale mal, es aburridisimo, y la verdad no entiendo el sentido de jugar.|`|kLC3JDAlaa	El juego me parece demasiado aburrido porque poco a poco todo se va volviendo un tanto monótono... <br>  <br>  Algo así como que.. te levantas, te ba?as, desayunas algo si puedes, trabajas, limpias la casa, lees un rato o te entretienes con algo, cenas y a dormir... <br>  <br>  No le veo nada de interesante porque ni siquiera se establecen del todo las relaciones amistosas o afectuosas y todo lo hacen de una forma demasiado autómata, por ejemplo no puedo dar un masaje estando sentados o detallitos así...<br>  <br>  Lo único que me puede parecer divertido es cuando juegas con otras personas o cuando creo y pongo a trabajar a un personaje, me la paso divirtiéndome y encierro en paredes de 1x1 a otro personaje que se vaya muriendo poco a poco jajaja<br>  <br>  _- Alessandra -_

8b97c01498b9c178a14de58b73f8e01eaa	Oh yes oh yes. Ihave the game and personally believe it is the best MMORPG i've ever played (out of, world of warcraft, city of heros, runescape, maplestory, and guild wars) The leveling is fast at first then more challeging. The quests are fun and not too demanding and is highly addictive. There is even a lil warning that pops up after 2 hours of continued play :). Then again c5 if out already and I would suggest getting that one just because it has the same basic structure of lineage 2 c4 but with more quest better graphics ect.<br>  Summary: Scions of destiny amazing game, but C5 oath of blood is now up to be downloaded.

You should also go to the Modthesims2 game help section which explains what to do in this situation. There could be a number of reasons why this is happening, but checking out the game help section will help you pinpoint your problem. I've provided the link for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

fceff0ee3635e88acc3bd4620ef00ff3aa	Well, assuming you're playing on light and not beginner, I would think an hour and a half of dancing would burn at least 500 calories, maybe more? That's also assuming you're taking the occasional break, because something tells me you don't play DDR for an hour and a half straight.|`|5ad9dc4222beee4d16027d09f956bf12aa	It depends on various elements:<br>  <br>  Difficulty: Beginner, Basic, Another, SSR, or Oni;<br>  Intensity: Closeness of notes, such as drills, gallops, jumps, etc.;<br>  Extra Step: If any extra steps have been hit, like treating freezes (holds) for rolls (stepping repeatedly on a panel.<br>  <br>  Now, take this for example: The song Baby Baby Gimme Your Love on Basic. It is ridiculously easy, since it's a level 1 on the foot scale, so barely any Calories are burnt, like about 3 on average.<br>  <br>  A second example is MAX 300 on SSR. MAX 300 is one of the famous MAXxes (and the first, too.), and it has some step intensity. If you look at the groove radar, it will say that the Chaos is nearly off the chart. About 25 KCals will be burnt.<br>  <br>  A third is Paranoia Survivor MAX on Oni. This song is, well, tough. Chaos and Voltage are off the charts! Like 40 KCals will be burnt.<br>  <br>  Fascination MAXX is like that, but about 35-42 KCals will be burnt.<br>  <br>  So, if the song is ridiculously easy (LV 1-3), or ridiculously hard (LV 8+), different amounts will be burnt.|`|AA10828766	It really depends on what level you play and how much you move. it varies.|`|AA11089319	Hmm... First off factors like your weight do take affect when calculating calories. For me I expel 10 to 50 calories each song depending on the song I play. So for me after an hour of play which averages 25 songs, I kill 250 to 500 calories.<br>  <br>  Yes certain songs require more movement, not only in your legs but other parts as well. To effectively burn calories, keep water with you and avoid restraining your upper body by holding on to something while you play (a.k.a. bar hugging), last when playing DDR to work out always use home versions' workout mode, and only play at levels you are truly comfortable at. If you try to over exert yourself during long periods of play you could injure yourself.

El precio es de $4,300 pesos.<br>  <br>  El playstation 3 es uno de los mejores, las graficas son excelentes, el poder de la consola es monstruoso y si te gustaba la idea del control del Wii, el control del PS3 tiene sensores de movimiento como los del Wii, pero si tienes $13,300 pesos adelante y 800 o 900 varos para cada juego.<br>  <br>  El Xbox 360 (yo tengo uno) esta tambien muy bueno, te pregutaras xke lo enliste a lo ultimo, (era para ke no pensaras ke le doy preferencia, aunke si se la doy, ja ja ja), existen dos versiones, la COre System tiene un precio de $4,500 varos e incluye una consola, un control alambrico, los cables de video para HD RCA y el de S-Video y ya. LA desventaja es ke no vas a poder salvar el avance de tus juegos, tendrias ke comprar una memory aparte o un disco duro ke tiene un precio de $900 varos, este pakete es para los ke solo gustan de jugar y talves guardar algo de musica y fotos.<br>  <br>  Ahora lo bueno, el Xbox 360 en version Premium, incluye una consola, un disco duro de 20 GB, un control inalambrico, control remoto para DVD, cables HD TV y HD RCA y dos juegos, Project Gotham Racing y Perfect Dark Zero, el precio de $5,300 pesos y esta version te sirve para poder usar el Xbox Live ke es lo mejor de las cosas, imaginate jugar con diferentes personas del mundo en los juegos ke adoras y por si tal vez no has escuchado de este juego, te lo recomiendo si es ke piensas adkirir una 360, es el GEARS OF WARS, es el mejor de los juegos ke existen para 360 y te aseguro ke lo vas a amar.<br>  <br>  Respecto a lo ke dices del Burnout, es imposible ke el del PS2 este al alcance del 360, simplemente imposible, es una consola de nueva generacion, si te gusto el Burn, entonces juegalo en el 360, o en el PS3 yo solo te la pongo facil, no te puedo decir cual comprar.<br>  <br>  Bueno, es todo lo ke se me ocurre para decirte, dudas?, echalas a eobalex@hotmail.com.<br>  <br>  x AleK|`|9bYfBHlIaa	360 - MICROSOFT<br>  PLAY - SONY<br>  360 - pocos juegos<br>  PLAY - ufffffff<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  por eso y muchas cosas más: PLAY STATION 3

You will need to buy the disc and also probably pay postage fees.<br>  <br>  When I first bought the Sims 2, I went to install it and the disc 1 just snapped in half.  I sent my receipt and the disc back to Maxis and they sent me a replacement cd.<br>  <br>  Good luck

Make sure the Xbox 360 has plenty of ventilation and is in an area where heat is not a problem. Try not to leave the Xbox on unattended.

Good luck|`|KYRQNJtiaa	Sometimes with the 360 when the system is stood upright with a disk in(even if the machine is off) the disk can get scratched.  Microsoft in the last few days actually made a new policy where they would replace games that were scratched, so you should head over to www.xbox.com and you should see where to go from there.  If you feel like spending $15-$20 you can get a Disk Doctor from EB Games/Best buy that fixes some scratches, but I would recommend taking advantage of Microsofts new offer.|`|KcatHnWvaa	you could buy one of those CD doctor things they work pretty well but the cost almost as much as the game but it pays for itself after you use it a couple of times or you could take it to a place like Eb games or game stop (or your favorite game store ) and they will charge you like $10 to do it for you|`|MYH4QaPgaa	sometimes ull need to clean small particles in the cd tray... this is probably y it came out all scratched up....<br>  or you will need to lay the xbox 360 down flat on the floor, dont leave it standing up unattended because this will also scratch up the CDs<br>  depending on how deep the scratches are, you can buy a cd repair kit (i found disk doctor to be a great disk repairer for about $20 bucks) that will smooth out the scratches. you can find it at most gaming or computer stores (EB games, best buy, comp USA|`|hTQ7tpXMaa	if you 360 is standing up the explaines it  just lay it flat

vahn499Raa	i haven't played in a long time|`|n4RCTXK2aa	There is a big difference between Destroy and negate. Mobius effect can destroy up to 2 trap or spells on the field. If you have a trap hole face-down and targets it you can activate it to destroy his monster.<br>  <br>  You should have in case a Divine Wrath trap card to negate it's effect.|`|MPJYNAgqaa	You can still activate the two card as a chain to its effect.  Even though they've been targeted by Mobius, you can still activate your spell and trap cards.  You chain your first spell/ trap card to Mobius' effect, then chain your other spell/trap card to your other card.  Doing so will be sort of like a waste to Mobius effect.|`|2GWtU1JJaa	the effect is legit and yea the spell and trap cards are sent to the grave yard without activating the cards sorry but there is a way around that if you have BY ORDER OF THE EMPEROR its effect is YOU CAN CHOOSE TO NEGATE THE ACTIVATION OF AN EFFECT MONSTER'S EFFECT THAT ACTIVATES WHEN A MONSTER IS NORMAL SUMMONED (INCLUDING ITSELF). IF YOU DO, THAT EFFECT MONSTER'S CONTROLLER DRAWS ONE CARD  this is an all time trap card and it would negate the effect of that monster and can be used more then once|`|i7e4hGO4aa	Your friend is right if he tribute summons it successfully then the 2 cards are sent to the graveyard.... unless you have a card you can activate that cancels  Mobius the Frost Monarch's effect|`|jsgKGtdBaa	Yu Gi Oh?<br>  <br>  You have to be from 4chan. There's no way your being serious.|`|K0rsk9osaa	You can still activate your "Trap cards" or "Quick-Play Spells" by chaining to mobius's effect for instance:<br>  <br>  Mobius is tribute summoned and you opponent activates his effect (Chain Link 1)    You can now respond by activating a "Quick Play Spell" or a Trap card. Whatever card you activate becomes (Chain Link 2).<br>  <br>  If no other cards are activated, here's what happens:<br>  <br>  Chain Link 2 Happens before Chain Link 1. So once your (Chain Link 2) trap or spell's effect is done, then The two cards he selected are destroyed. <br>  <br>  Example He summon's Mobius, and uses his effect on your two face down spell/trap cards. One of your Face down cards is Bottomless Trap Hole. You can activate Bottomless Trap Hole and remove from play his Mobius. Once that is done Mobius then destroys the two selected Spell/Trap Cards.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|AjHwWTbxaa	Ok, does the effect say, destroy and negate or just destroy?<br>  <br>  Because if it doesn't say negate, that means you are still able to activate that trap before it gets destroyed... When a card is destroyed it gets sent to the graveyard, <br>  <br>  So, if the card says destroy and negate, it means you cannot activate, if it just says destroy 2 cards etc, it means you are able to activate the effect. And the cards are destroyed.|`|xW8R6ZKBaa	no u can still activate b4 cards are destroyed because it does not say that it negates them|`|PO9AeonLaa	no is cheating so you lose

There may be some merchandising deal preventing them from making any kind of Kingdom Hearts attraction or merchandise.

joItQAWVaa	Sorry but you need to become member or otherwise drop em, but dont drop you will lose alotta money! If you cannot afford membership or anything heres an alternative I turned to when I had this problem. At prizerebel.com you fill out a bunch of crappy ads and you get points. When you get to 10 points they will send a $10 gaming card to your email. Once you recieve the code you can enter it onto runescape and become member for a month!!!! What sucks is that it takes about 4 hours to get 10 points :[] Hope This Hewlps!|`|KzRH5LjZaa	not unless you sell on internet but you will get banned so your best bet is to become a member|`|OnyHVyftaa	When you beome a member to sell.. i can try to buy from you =)<br>  <br>  demonstr4eva|`|AjHwWTbxaa	Well, i can only say, Sorry that you left your bank account full of members items...

CbksN6cTaa	good deck but you should keep it to about 30-50cards tops and try to get some stronger cards like red eyes b dragon then red eyes darkness dragon|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Heavy Storm = LIMITED to 1<br>  Mystical Space Typhoon = LIMITED to 1<br>  Premature Burial = BANNED<br>  Call of the Haunted = BANNED<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your deck has no focus, no consistency either. Your deck has too many cards. Decks MUST be between 40 and 60 cards. <br>  <br>  <br>  3/10|`|jpanE29Haa	to be honest with you (and please don't take it personally) i'd rate it 3 out of 10. The main reason is it is way too big. You want a deck with no more than 40-45 cards (40 is the minimum allowed in a deck) and you need to stick to one theme. The dragons aren't too bad but you need to lose others like The Creator. I ran it, and though it has a great effect, it just slows down the type of deck i think you're trying to run, being a dragon deck. These days you need to be clear what dragons you want in a dragon deck as well, such as if you have Blue Eyes white, you don't really want to be running Red Eyes Black, and vise-versa as there are plenty of cards to support one or the other, and running both will make your deck run too slow. The same goes for the Level cards like Horus and Armed Dragon. If you want a Blue Eyes, or Red Eyes, takje them out. Please get rid of the E-Heros. They are a thing of the past IMO. Reslly yopu can only run 1 Mystical Space Typhoon, Ultimate Offering and Heavy Storm in a deck anyway, plus i advise having only 1 Lightning Vortex and 1 Magical Mallet as you will probably only get the chance to use them once in a duel anyway. Kuriboh is my fave card due to my 1st game i ever played (7 years ago) but you might wanna take that out as well due to deck size.<br>  <br>  The deck has potential tho so please don't feel disheartened. If you want some extra deck advise please feel free to email me at godsaiyan@yahoo.co.uk and i will give you a few examples of decks you wish to make|`|u76FjmDkaa	personally its to big,,, if i were you i would try to get rid of as many cards as possible. you should only keep 40-50 cards. my reason is that when you draw on the opening hand you have a big chance of not having a 4 star monster to play and by not having one you would be wide open for an attack.i had to learn this the hard way in a tournament one time!  hope this helps!|`|jFfbbQn7aa	It's allright but kinda long lol|`|aWRmOWgLaa	horrible..what are you playing? highlander
CQmITRetaa	It's simple really, once you figure it out.<br>  <br>  Keep attacking the boss with the sword. The axe boss will try to hit you, move away immediately.<br>  <br>  His axe will be stuck in the ground. Ignore the Sword boss and keep hitting the Axe boss. Keep doing this and after a while Speed Kill option will come.<br>  <br>  Do the Speed kill and finish these guys.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Have Fun...|`|f4a1ecf3d066f08f6f5f82bfb1e711bfaa	You mean fighting against the bosses with the axe and sword at the same time, just after the chariot sequence, right?  <br>  <br>  Don't attack the sword guy.  Focus on the guy with the axe.  Dodge until he does a big strike and he'll get his axe stuck in the ground.  Start attacking him and a timed-strike sequence will start allowing you to attack the sword guy.  Repeat this a couple of times to take them out.
OsvMjdzWaa	I'm completely in your position! I'm fourteen and my mum let me get it! Just say how good it is and say the bad bits aren't that bad and the good bits outnumber them. Also try the good old 'All my mates have it'. I got it and I don't regret it , but I'm a big GTA fan.|`|ZXkmsCT4aa	You need to tell your parents and tell yourself, yes, the game expresses strong bad behaviour, but you SHOULD be smart enough to know, never to follow in those footsteps, wether or not it seems fun, its not going to be when your in prison. Talk to them about it, tell them you wont reinact, but its a fun game.|`|AjHwWTbxaa	well, you are 14... And your parents allow you to play 15-16 games... GTA is an 18... I can probably see why, sex,drugs and violence packed into one lovely neat package, I'm going to agree with your parents, you aren't ready for it.|`|joItQAWVaa	if all that u said is true, you should be able to play this game. Just talk to your parents and include all of these things u said in your description! Its a really fun game. :)|`|DSOJvIhtaa	At your age i would tend to say no. Because you get good grades and are responsible does that mean you should be able to drive or go to a bar and drink? No, the line has to be drawn somewhere. Don't be pissed at your parents, they need to create boundaries for you so THEY feel secure and in charge. Stick it out a couple years. Earning your parents trust is far more valuable than being able to play a video game, trust me.|`|Y5NtZBRJaa	If you have the sense to not let a game affect you, GTA is completely and entirely harmless. The reason it gets such bad media attention is because of the controversy raised by people who didn't bother to do research on the psychological effects of video games, who erroneously claimed that the GTA series was responsible for deaths and violence.<br>  <br>  All research, however, indicates that the claims against violent video games are entirely false. If you treat it as a game and nothing but, like basically every mentally stable gamer in history, it's as harmless as any other game.|`|ZwmVrFeWaa	Heh you must have pretty cool parents if they know something about gta when I was your age I was playing GTA San Andreas even through the gta4 is very violent game and it also has best prostitutes in the whole series I still think that 14 is a mature age to play this game <br>  Hope youll get it GL|`|I4V4q2FEaa	well most M games dont have EVERYTHING that GTA has all wrapped in one. usually M games like Call of Duty and Gears have only blood, violence, stuff liek that. GTA has EVERYTHING imaginable in it. so maybe they dont want you exposed to all of the elements at once.|`|KzRH5LjZaa	not really appropriate but then again i got my first gta game at the age of nine (within a week i got it taken off me lol)|`|0rMUi02laa	maybe get over it and wait 3 years until you're an adult.
DxrVouhVaa	They can be found on a mannequin doll in a red brick building called "Lucky's", southwest of Tenpenny Tower near the southern edge of the game area. Interestingly enough, the building itself has nothing to do with the caravan merchant of the same name. The building is easily visible from the entrance to Warrington Station. The shop is adjacent to a bombed-out building and a parking lot. The mannequin is in the back of the shop looking straight from the entrance. The shop also has every ingredient needed to make one of each custom schematic weapon, except a deathclaw hand and a radscorpion poison gland. However, the shopkeeper (a scavenger) doesn't sell everything he has in the store, theft may be necessary. There is also a copy of Pugilism Illustrated under the counter. <br>  <br>  edit NotesLucky Shades can be repaired using any eyewear (eyeglasses, etc.). The Lucky Shades aren't marked as owned so taking them won't count as stealing (they won't be marked red). <br>  <br>  Remember that eyewear, including the Lucky Shades, can be worn in addition to non-face headgear (such as the Sheriff's Hat) and it can be worn with the new Chinese stealth suit <br>  <br>  edit BugsIt seems the shades can fall off the mannequin and land on the mannequin stand, where picking them up may be difficult.[1][2] <br>  <br>  If the shades have fallen, they can usually still be picked up by entering third person and crouching near them then rotating the camera until the message to take them appears, by first dislodging them with explosives, or both. <br>  <br>  Alternatively, in the PC versions they can be added to the player's inventory with the console with the command player.additem 000CB54B 1 which will add one pair of Lucky Shades to your inventory. <br>  <br>  The Lucky Shades can be picked-up on the PS3 version. Stand in front of the mannequin in the same direction the mannequin is facing. Make sure the camera angle is behind you, so when you are in that position the camera angle will be looking almost directly over your head. Slowly move your curser over your position and the message should appear. A similar method for the PS3 is to stand in front of the mannequin (between its base and the nearby chair), but face toward the damaged section of wall beside the refrigerator at the end of the shop. When in this position, adjust the camera in third person. It should be as close to the player as possible, and roughly face away from the mannequin when the message for the shades appears. <br>  <br>  A way to recover the lucky shades is to crouch on the corner of the stand facing the chair. Go into first person view, and stare at the shelves. Switch to third-person view, and slowly move the cursor towards the HAM radio on the shelf. The message should appear when close to the radio.
xyOcnQjpaa	That is a issue with the maps. If for instance i'm going to use CSS for this, you have OEM version of DE_DUST, and the sever has HACKED version of DE_DUST... You will not be able to join because of a version mismatch... If you like this server and want to play in this server, delete the map DE_DUST out of your game map directory and join it, then you will automagically download the servers version of the map and you will be able to join.|`|Y5NtZBRJaa	Update DoD:S to the newest version and try again.

xvCW5OsYaa	if you want to be a musician go to a private instructor to learn guitar there are far to many people that "play" guitar that can't even read music, those are the guys on the street they might know what sounds good but they will never know what their playing. it is possible to be a good student and a musician you just have to make compromises get the homework done first then practice and make sure you get outta your house or you ll end up like me sitting in my studio for days strait till your girlfriend comes down with a sand which ya sandwiches. you need to decide if your passion for music is strong enough to practice 8 hours a day can you do that every day if not become a chemical engineer that's a decent job.|`|lp8WvmZTaa	yes,  I would go for it.|`|5lLUgRuhaa	hm.. maybe you should ask this question in another section.<br>  <br>  but my answer is:<br>  i give you a little change, but first work on your grades, and after that go into music, if you aren't that talented, and you can't become a really good musician, than you always can go to college, maybe not some that is good, but everything is better than becoming a street performance. so first finish your school, with the best grades you can possible get. after that, go concentrate on music, write songs, make a band, i am not really in that kind of stuff. if you succeed and your band becomes good, you should be really happy since you achieved something almost nobody could do. if you just have not enough experience than go study at a college and at least get a  diploma, and get a job, don't give up on music keep playing maybe later you will be good enough, but get a diploma so you at least have a good job if you still don't have enough talent or experience for living from music. <br>  <br>  I hope you succeed in achieving your dream.

sEPrpdY4aa	1. I think they will let you do that.  Many casiono even provide "score cards" for players to record which numbers have been showing up on the wheel.  After all, it just perpertuates the illusion that the player somehow can "beat" the system.<br>  <br>  2. Vegas roulette wheels have 0 and 00.  I think Atlantic City, though has only 0.<br>  <br>  3.  Basically you're right.  Playing inside is betting on the specific numbers which playing the outside means you're playing the other bets that are not number specific (i.e. red/black, odd/even etc.) and these bets are placed in designated spots outside of the numbers.<br>  <br>  Good luck (though roulette in the long-run is universally a guaranteed loser's game).|`|UVUYG5jaaa	nnnnnoooo you can't bring a pencil or paper<br>  most of the tables are 00 and 0 combined<br>  like any other popular place, there's always people there<br>  inside bets are direct numbers<br>  outside bets are other options, like red/black<br>  if the chip is covering the line, your betting on 2 numbers, but the payout is 1/2....if the chip is covering 4 numbers, your payout is1/4|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	1) Yes..

Incedently the guy who invented roulette killed himself because he couldnt improve it and it was the perfect house game!<br>  The house average or house edge (also called the expected value) is the amount the player loses relative to any bet made, on average.

r9HSCQO1aa	You have asked a great question.  As chess players go, there have been many different personality types who have played the game.  It is true that your personality will reflect in your playing "style"..or maybe not!...  there have been some "reserved" players that have an very aggressive playing style.  (are they latent aggressors??) <br>  <br>  Players belong to all temperamental types but what they do have in common is a knack for calculation of variations...TACTICS!  This ability to calculate variations is the single greatest attribute of a chess player.  Without it, one can never become great.  There are a few other attributes:<br>  <br>  1.  Objectivity<br>  2.  Ability to Project Positions  (Calculate)<br>  3.  A Good Move Selection Method<br>  4.  A Good Mental Clock Rate (rate at which calculations are made)<br>  5.  A regimen of continued study (Own games, Tactical positions {problems} and GM games--in that order!!)<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to improve these five areas, any one of these which are weak would decrease your overall ability.  Strengthen your weakest one FIRST.  Do not concern yourself with which GM your playing style is most like.  Just play according to principles.  <br>  <br>  The first principle of chess is the principle of ATTACK. <br>  You must play the attacking (forcing) move whenever possible (a forcing move is one that "forces" the opponent to defend).  As long as he is defending, he cannot plan/play actively.  When it is not possible to attack, you must follow the second principle of the chess game:<br>  <br>  The second principle in chess is the principle of Maximum ACTIVITY.  You must allow your pieces to have the maximum amont of activity on the chess board (available squares to move to and control) which also includes the maximum POTENTIAL for movement this includes the development of all the pieces in the opening and connecting of the Rooks.  It often is easily improved by understanding the principle of the LEAST ACTIVE PIECE (weakest link in chain...if improved, your entire activity level will improve).  ALL ALL ALL chess instructions are built on these tenets!!!<br>  <br>  Playing classical openings like the Ruy Lopez or Queens Gambit, even the Center Counter will help you to improve your tactical vision and create your own style of play.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your chess!|`|FgrRggenaa	for actual defined types of players, there are styles of players and styles of openings<br>  <br>  1. Tactician, knows how to play the game well, sticks with his openings, and overwhelms just by knowing more than you do.<br>  2. Abstract: knows how to play the game well but relies on odd tactics to win. More of a psych out person. You play something odd that you studied and the opponent misses the correct moves since they don't know the style.<br>  <br>  of the types:<br>  1. Passive, you play defensive openings such as Gucco Piano or the basic openings. Games are close and people usually draw, you prefer king side castling<br>  2. Offensive: Gambit based openings, simply, you win or they win, draws aren't seen often, you prefer queen side castling|`|UVUYG5jaaa	im a trash talker. i like it when my opponent is also a trash talker. but if im playing in a tournament with strangers, i'm very polite and dignified. when i'm with my friends i'll say "ccchhheeehhhkkk" maybe i'll see you online?|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Among the regular population The guys in Class A,B,C,D,E fall into two types:<br>  <br>  Viking berserkers with battle axes <br>  and boa constrictors  <br>  <br>  As players get better it is:<br>  <br>  Killer surgeons with scalpels<br>  and pythons<br>  <br>  Oh, and sanity is optional.<br>  Monomania and paranoia might actually be good for a chess player.<br>  (Your opponent really is out to get you.)
d0f5RJ8Jaa	hairbend has explained it very well.<br>  i always prefer freehand - whether it is drawing or embroidery, etc...<br>  <br>  for quilting, whenever i get around to it, i have a few patterns in mind. i would love to make a landscape - green valleys, brown mountains, rising sun, blue clouds, flowing river, flying birds, a little cottage, ..... <br>  <br>  or just a huge sun on one side with its rays streaking out in all directions. this would obviously be a quilt of warm colors - all in shades of yellow - orange - red.<br>  <br>  or just waves in the ocean/sea - different shades of blue in wavy patterns with a few boats with sails drifting along....sea gulls soaring above ...<br>  <br>  and i prefer plain fabric to printed; although textured is fine to bring about variety & depth. with plain fabric, i can add some embroidery that will really make it stand out or give it some details.<br>  and i wouldn't sew through the layers in a regular geometric pattern either. i'd go with the theme of the quilt in choosing the thread colors as well as patterns.<br>   <br>  just sharing my ideas <br>  hope you like them .....<br>  have fun & go with your instincts, imagination & creativity|`|154dzJ1Faa	In the very beginning, the traditional quilt was made of pieces of left-over bits of fabric.  They could have been of any shape or size, and were quite literally patches!  They were stitched together as they were -- no special design was cut out of them.  If a spot was worn or torn on a quilt, a patch was simply sewn over that spot -- a quilt was too valuable to throw away simply because of a hole!<br>  <br>  Later, some aspiring artists that could afford the luxury of cutting up their "patches" created designs with their quilts.  And it grew from there, where people actually went out and BOUGHT fabric for a patch quilt!  Then they were able to cut them specifically for the kind of geometric patterns they were developing.<br>  <br>  Today, they don't even have to be geometric.  Many are full-sized pictures of recognizable items or scenes.  They are "art quilts" and are not to be used.<br>  <br>  So you can make them anyway you want.  There doesn't have to be any rhyme or reason for your design.  A quilt is only to be warm, and appearance is secondary.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	No, they aren't.  A quilt is just a blanket and there really aren't any rules as to how the top should be pieced together.  Crazy quilts from the mid 19th Century are a perfect example of creative quilting.  Make your quilt to suit yourself and have some fun.|`|Mnkuxy8yaa	actually, by any stretch of the imagination, all patchwork pieces are geometric, even the crazy quilts and strip quilts<br>  you can make a quilt without piecing pieces together, just by sandwiching layers together and sewing them.  What makes it a quilt is the sandwich of upper and lower levels with an insulating layer inbetween that is then sewn thru all layers.|`|77b415a109cd2d4e23f60c5ea7484b36aa	Kay wood has a very cool method called the 6 hour quilt  look at her site under applique Its pictures not blocks.She has a few movies you can watch|`|xvCW5OsYaa	no look at simple contemporary quilts its a good book with good ideas

d0f5RJ8Jaa	- since she's going in for knee replacement surgery, how about gifting her a throw for her legs [knit or crochet] ? she will be able to use this even in future. also a scarf for her shoulders.<br>  - besides crosswords, add other types of puzzles if she enjoys those [or she can learn a new type with all the free time she'll have on hand ;-)] eg. sudoku, kakuro, hitori, word search, acrostics, anagrams, etc.<br>  - add a board game that she enjoys & can play with her visitors too. eg. scrabble, etc.<br>  - a jigsaw puzzle would be good too. however, make sure she has a spare table or a thick/plywood board on which it can be done & kept without disturbance.<br>  - add a few chocolates, munchies, cookies, cupcakes,....<br>  - is there anything she's always wanted to do/try but didn't have the time for? see if it can be done & add that.<br>  - if she enjoys cross-stitch or embroidery, add a kit. <br>  - if she enjoys reading, add a book. however, make sure it is light reading. <br>  - add an ipod or CD player with selected music [& headphones?].<br>  - you have to add a "get-well-soon" card -- handmade would be really appreciated & signed by all the family. you could make it with dried flowers & herbs, sprinkled with some scent/attar.<br>  - maybe a mini scrapbook?<br>  - also include a blank diary or notebook where she can write her thoughts, feelings, memories, reflections.....during her stay. with this, you'll obviously need to include a pen or pencil. how about some color pencils/crayons too if she enjoys sketching? <br>  - a photograph of the family to display in her room.<br>  - you could even get all family members to say & record something on a tape/cassette for her, before or after her surgery, along with the card. she can listen to the messages & voices at will.<br>  - a perfume bottle<br>  - air freshener<br>  - glycerin soap<br>  - her favorite cosmetics, talc, ...<br>  <br>  make sure whatever you put in the basket doesn't require too much effort or concentration. because if she's in pain, she may not enjoy tough stuff.  <br>  <br>  hope these inspire<br>  all the very best & hope your Grandma has a successful & pain-free surgery & rehab.|`|JtcVwK2Caa	I love the ideas that have been given to you so far. Your Grandma is going to love getting this basket! Maybe you could space the gifts out a little so she isn't overwhelmed?<br>  <br>  The only other things I thought of were her favourite magazine, writing paper, envelopes and stamps (plus her address book if you know where it is), some moisturiser and lip balm (hospital air conditioning can dry you out!), and maybe some change in case she wants to buy a paper or small treat from a hospital trolley/vending machine. <br>  <br>  A friend of mine was just in hospital for serious surgery recently and another friend took her some craft supplies. They made some decorated bookmarks and cards. I know she enjoyed that a lot. would your Grandma like that idea?<br>  <br>  A bunch of her friends also made her a 'get well soon' scrapbook. She really treasured that. Maybe each member of the family could do a page in a scrapbook for her? And her friends could, too? It doesn't have to be a complicated page or a big albim. You can get 6" x 6" albums, for example.<br>  <br>  You're very thoughtful to be doing this and I am sure your efforts will be appreciated. Hope your Grandma feels better soon.|`|QgXN2kB6aa	favorite cookies, batteries for the remote control, a movie, a little poker playing game, a new nightie, lotion, sugarless candies, puzzle books, yarn and a knitting (crochet-whatever) pattern.|`|ZXkmsCT4aa	Well what does she like?

CbksN6cTaa	i think 360 because 1. it has better graffic system<br>  2. it has like a achievement piont thingy so when you achieve something in the game you get a certain amount of score you get 1000 score altogether in 1 game i have 13170score so thats over 13games.<br>  3.you can go online and play with friends in games and its alot easier to understand thn the ps3. oh and dont get  ps3 because every time u turn it on it takes 30mins-1hour to load up the updates and other stuff as the 360 takes like 30secs-20mins top. and the only reason anyone gets a ps3 is because when you leeve it on it helps scientist come up with a cure for cancer.|`|2fqXT9W6aa	The Xbox 360 hands down, it has better graphics (want proof, PS3 fanboys? <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/features/6162742/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://uk.gamespot.com/features/6162742/...</a> ) and better exclusive games. Also, it's cheaper and It's online play is better. The RRoD and other problems have been fixed now. The PS3 has blu-ray, but on the Xbox 360 the games are better and they are GAMES consoles after all.|`|vqORe0Opaa	i have all consoles and i wud rather my ps3 by a mile   more mature people online aswell  and for everyone who says the ps3 does'nt have better graphics   well it does  for games that come out on both consoles they have to de-grade the graphics to suit the xbox. that is why FF is delayed|`|2yUQiKlvaa	i own a xbox 360, absolutely fantastic console... firstly cos it has great games available for it, such as fable II, gears of war 1/2, halo, etc. many more but they are available on the ps3 as well.<br>  <br>  i think that the xbox controller has a moree comfortable grip and its cool how you can chrage it and play the game. <br>  <br>  the graphics are very good as well<br>  <br>  i dont have live but i love my xbox even without it <br>  <br>  =)|`|cgjbw1jKaa	i have had my playstation for three odd years and my brother has had his xbox for about two years the other day his xbox completely messed up. it broke . so for reliability i would say playstation .as for graphics? my pc has better graphics than his xbox . i am runnig a radeon 4870 tho . we compared the graphical quality between my computer with radeon graphics card and his xbox and we both agreed that my comp was noticably better.|`|I4V4q2FEaa	I like the 360 more mainly for the online community. The online community for the xbox is so much bigger then the PS3's online network. That is basically the only reason i really would give the xbox 360 a thumbs up..|`|OBklo7D6aa	Gamecube<br>  seriously:<br>  Halo - Metroid (original)<br>  Fifa 09 - Fifa 03 (best fifa ever)<br>  small, compact and does the job nicely|`|8YxeHZtraa	I have both 360 and ps3. both have great exclusives, 360 halo, gears of war, fable. PS3 mgs4, little big planet, ratchet and clank.<br>  They both have strengths and weaknesses, 360s online is obviously better, they've had it up since the original xbox and charge you a membership fee. Ps3 has free internet and wireless. <br>  360 is better for shooters, but when it comes to adventure, fighting, and platform games, ps3 wins. The 360 has more games ( it's been out at least a year longer) and you'll be able to find them cheaper online or at game stop. <br>  <br>  When choosing which system to purchase you have to consider what your friends have, especially if you plan to play online or they only have 1 controller. How much money you are willing to spend on the system, accessories, and online. The 360 is cheaper ($199 without hard drive, hard drive $99, $299 with 60gig) but if you add a wireless adapter (99), and a live subscription( $7 - $50) your paying more then you are for ps3 ($399 w/80gig hard drive). And most importantly the exclusive games. Most games will come out on both systems but if your a die hard halo fan then you should by a 360. If you love metal gear solid get a ps3. <br>  <br>  I own both and prefer PS3, it has blu ray, free internet, wireless, and can do almost everything a 360 can plus more. Any games that I have that are on both systems I buy for my ps3.|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	Xbox 360 is better, here's why:<br>  <br>  1. I don't care to shell out $400+ for a GAME SYSTEM. Blu-ray, whatever, I want my game system to be, first and foremost, a game system. If I really want blu-ray movies, I'll buy a blu-ray player, they are not that expensive anymore.<br>  <br>  2. Gears of War, LOL. You'll never have that on PS3. PS3 has what? Little Big Planet? MGS4? MGS4 may at some point come out on the 360. <br>  <br>  I own both a 360 and a Wii. That's the perfect combo.|`|BI9ku2nOaa	Xbox 360, i may not own a ps3 but jebus christ its so expensive!<br>  Ok so 1 xbox has some pretty awsome games out for it atm<br>  2 xbox graphics are pretty awsome ps3 may be mildly better but for the money its no where near worth it<br>  3 the xbox live is v v good<br>  hope it helps|`|sRfwcE15aa	Get a ps3. Its free online, heaps of hdd space and and has awesome games like resistance 2, little big planet, gran turismo 5 and killzone 2. Also the only good xbox 360 game is halo 3 but resistance 2 is much better. Trust me go wit ps3 and add me!!!

zkscW8seaa	No, Royal Oppression cannot effect Jinzo since Jinzo's effect is in effect as soon as it hits the field, and since Royal Oppression is a Spell Speed 2 like Jinzo, it cannot counter Jinzo's summoning or effect. Only Spell Speed 3 cards, such as Counter Trap Cards like Solemn Judgment can negate Jinzo's summoning and effect.|`|iaOcPjtaaa	If Royal oppression is out when you summon jinzo then yes you can because jinzo effect doesn't activate imediately which is why you can bottomless trap hole it.|`|fpVZ6o0daa	About Royal Oppression a Jinzo can be read in <a href="http://usa-people-blog.blogspot.com/?q=Royal%20Oppression%20a%20Jinzo" rel="nofollow">http://usa-people-blog.blogspot.com/?q=R...</a>
NworBT5saa	Lickilicky's special attack is slightly lower than it's attack, so you might want to go for more physical moves (assuming it has a nature that allows it to have higher attack). <br>  If it's attack is higher, you could use:<br>  Earthquake<br>  Return<br>  Gyro Ball<br>  Brick Break/Power Whip<br>  <br>  However, if it has higher Sp. Attack, or if you want more special based attacks, try:<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Ice Beam<br>  Flamethrower/Thunder Bolt<br>  Hyper Beam / Explosion<br>  <br>  For the last special attack... the only Normal Special move it learns is Hyper Beam, but this does take two turns, so you might want to go with Explosion (physical, but would still be powerful) to finish the other pokemon off (depending on your HP)<br>  <br>  TM of Psychic can be found in Veilstone Game Corner and on Route 211<br>  <br>  As for the name, it really depends... I often use baby name sites to find one with a suitable meaning =P (e.g. I named my Arcanine Teagan, which means 'firey'|`|fGaa8yc9aa	I would suggest shadow ball, thunder, and gyro ball. I don't know where the TM is but you could name your lickylicky slimy or Licker. Hope that helped at all.|`|fQ1XGJnLaa	Shadow Ball  is good  and good name coul be Tuffy or Fluffy or Lintree|`|Pw1y449Daa	1. Lickilicky:<br>  Gyro Ball<br>  Power Whip<br>  Earthquake<br>  Brick Break/Rock Slide<br>  <br>  Don't teach the lickilicky flamethrower cuz lickilicky has bad special attack stat and the flamethrower wont do much damage. But the attacks above are all physical, and lickilicky has higher attack stat, so it would do more damage.<br>  <br>  2. It depends on who learns it and the super effective stuff. Psychic is more powerful than Shadow Ball cuz psychic does 90 damage, while shadow ball does only 80. But they are both considered very powerful moves.<br>  <br>  3. I think you can buy a TM Psychic at the Veilstone Game Arcade Store where you exchange for game coins. You need to buy some game coins at the game place beside the game shop before you can actually buy the TM.<br>  <br>  4.

SmWoRu3kaa	For Amnesia and Curse, you need SLOWPOKE. You'll get Belly Drum, Sleep Talk, and Snore from SNORLAX. LAPRAS will give you Body Slam. Hammer Arm comes from RHYDON. You can get Magnitude from RHYHORN (but it'll need to get it from a DIGLETT). If you really want Smellingsalt, you can get a Smeargle to sketch it and pass it to LICKILICKY through WHISMUR. You can also get Substitute through a big long breeding chain, but the TM is probably faster.|`|NworBT5saa	Heyas. To breed a Lickitung with certain egg moves, you will need a female Lickilicky/Lickitung, and a male pokemon, in the same egg group, and with the moves you would like the egg to have. See the website below for a full list of the egg moves it can have, and who learns them (that it can breed with). <br>  <br>  Also, all eggs can hatch with any TM that they can learn at that stage, as long as the father knows it.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	any Male pokemon that knows the Egg move you want Lickilicky to know

Aoq9FDy4aa	actually if i remember correctly there was a card game played in europe using tarot cards. probably. there are six suits in a tarot deck, so its a little more complicated. i think. i dont know for sure. but youre right about being able to use a deck of playing cards to do readings. the formations are simplified, but the method and mythology is the same. i read that in a random book i picked up about voodoo some years ago. however my source on the game with the tarot cards is more sketchy becuz i dont exactly where i got that morsel of information.

Hope that helped.|`|vWtucEFSaa	You would have to capture or raise or trade for a sunny one.  There are two varients of the Cherrium.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Physiology<br>  Cherrim has two different forms, both of which are dependent on the weather (a trait that is also found in Castform). During normal weather conditions, it appears as two crossing purple petals with a short purple stem, a green leafy sepal covering, and two deep pink feet; its eyes appear to be near its legs in this form. When there is strong sunlight, it appears to have a skirt and hair made of pink cherry-blossom petals. Additionally, two berry-like orbs, resembling cherry-shaped hair ornaments, adorn its head. <br>  <br>  The only other thing is, do you mean Shiny Pokemon? Those are rare...

These are cool to use with each other since it makes everyone fight, and the girls will group around you and protect you.

Dso7k3sjaa	If use a hack that allows you to keep making the parents younger (or one of the cheats that can turn an elder back into an adult sim) then you could feasibly have a sim that had 100 kids.  Why anyone would want to is beyond me, but it's your game so play it your way.  :-)<br>  <br>  The only way to have triplets and quads is by downloading a hack that's at this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php/topic,18.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php/t...</a><br>  <br>  Make sure you read everything cause it seems to me the last time I looked it over, there are two versions but you need to pick which one you want and only put one version into your game or else they will conflict with each other and cause you problems.<br>  <br>  I don't have Bon Voyage so I don't know.  I do know that I've read that your sim cannot Own and Run a hotel, but I thought you could actually build hotels that the game runs.  Yep, you must be able to because there are two hotels available for downloading at MTS2:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.modthesims2.com/browse.php?f=513&showType=2&gameOrig=1&gameUni=1&gameNL=1&gameOFB=1&gameSeasons=1&gameFFS=1&gameGLS=1&gameCLS=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.modthesims2.com/browse.php?f=...</a><br>  <br>  **eta -- Jem, I don't have BV, but since a someone else obviously made a hotel already, how can you say that you can't make one?

It will probably take a really long time and your sim might die before you get 100. For the triplets, you just have to get lucky. There is no cheat to make a hotel. I've tried. But sims 3 might have. I've seen a lot of preview and I think it's going to be extremely better and more realistic than sims 2

Dso7k3sjaa	Hi, I answered your other question and told you that you needed the stove and the podium.  It's been a while since I built one so I'll need to go into my game to see where it is exactly, but I am sure it's in buy mode not build mode.  I'll brb.<br>  <br>  Okay.  You know how there are two icons in buy mode?  Click on the bottom icon, the one that says Community Sort.  Then you see four more and the first one looks like silverware?  Click on that one (Food) and then on the three little dots (Miscellaneous).  There are two podiums in that section.  One is called the "Gastronomique" Restaurant Podium and costs $200 and the other is called the Podium of Bonnappitizon and also costs $200.<br>  <br>  Once you have the stove, the podium and places for the sims to sit and eat that should be all you need.  As I said in my other answer, you can then just have one of your sims go to this new restaurant and as soon as you do, the game will generate the chef, the host/hostess and the waiters or you can have one of your sims buy the restaurant (as long as you have OFB installed -- which I think you said you did in your last question, but I can't remember for sure) by using the phone and clicking on Real Estate.<br>  <br>  If you do have one of your sims try to run it, the restaurant business is supposed to be the hardest type of business to run, but that doesn't mean you won't be good at it.  Me -- I'm lousy at running businesses in the game, lol!  But you could be a complete natural!|`|4Dihbisjaa	If it is in Buy mode then check in Miscellanious and Tables. If not, check build mode.
y822j5h5aa	The most common system is the Hi-Lo count. Start a new shoe with a count of Zero. Assign a value of +1 to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,  and -1 to tens and aces. Everything else is 0, or neutral. As the cards are played, add or subtract these counts to get the running count. A positive total indicates the deck is rich in tens and aces. Calculate the true count by  dividing the running count by the number of decks left to be played. The higher the number the better the deck for the player.<br>  <br>  But just knowing the count is not all there is to it, you must also know how to apply the count to adjust your betting. Here is a link that explains it all in detail. <a href="http://www.thedoverpro.com/blackjack/blackjack-card-counting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedoverpro.com/blackjack/bla...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck at the tables!|`|uzkUykenaa	There are various systems. The original (and easiest) is known as the Hi-Lo sytem. There are 13 cards (excluding suits) in a deck of cards. Cards 2-6 are valued at +1, 7-9 are valued at 0, and 10-A are valued at -1. This is because you want there to be plenty of 10's and Ace's in the deck to make a high hand. If there are loads of deuces and threes, you need to draw more cards and you'll go bust most of the time. If you want to practice, use a standard 52 card deck and count them. You should end up with the count at 0 at the end. Then once you can do it quick enough use another deck. Casino's tend to use 4-6 decks in a shoe, but can use up to 8.<br>  <br>  NOTE: It isn't illegal to card count in casino's, but they have a right to throw you out if caught, so you shouldn't give anything away whilst doing it.<br>  <br>  Good luck; I'll expect a 33% cut of your winnings ;)|`|bSIsPN6gaa	well, when you see one card, count one. when the next one comes, thats 2. after that is 3, then 4, and 5. now it gets confusing. after 5 is 6, then come 7, and 8, but dont forget 9... then 10....|`|5Xmbd6RVaa	Bad idea.

There is no game entitled "COD 5". There is a game called "Call of Duty: World at War" (CoD:WaW). Did you call "Grand Theft Auto 3:Vice City" "Grand Theft Auto 4"? Did you call "GTA 3:San Andreas" GTA 5"? No, you didn't, because that's not the name. Call the game by the name it is given, not the name you make up for it.<br>  <br>  CoD 4: Modern Warfare 2 is coming out. Don't call it COD6, because that would be WRONG.
