I was approaching a give way sign and looked to my right, a lorry was approaching so i stopped. The car that was behind me crashed into the rear of my vehicle and pushed my car out into the middle of the main road.The lorry missed me by an inch.

They gave me a courtesy car for ten days but came today and took it away from me. What could be going on?   Any advice anyone???

20090309182102AAfcN0y	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How do I fix my "light relay" in my car?	One day a few months back, the inside and outside lights on my car suddenly wouldn't turn off. I didn't know what was wrong, so we found which fuse allowed these lights to come on and removed it, which is also the fuse that allows my power windows to work. Today I got a new fuse and when I put it in, I still had the same problem as before - the lights wouldn't go out.   I would have simply removed the inside light bulb, but the outside lights (these are lights that are installed within the underneath of my side mirrors) would still remain on and I can't remove the bulbs from them and wouldn't want my battery life being eaten up.   I've been told that my issue isn't a fuse problem, but rather a "light relay" problem.    How would I go about solving this problem? I'd really like to get it done myself if possible, it would stink to have to pay to have it fixed.

20090309183933AAfNhAw	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	How would I be able to convince my parents to buy me a car?	I am a 16 year old student. While my brother and sister go to a pricey private high school, and while I considered joining them I've opted to stay public in order to leave some more money available.  My family is well off, and money is rarely an issue.  But here's the problem: I don't have a car!  I have been trying to come up with a way to convince my parents to but me a car, I've had no luck.  The easy retort to this complaint would be to tell me to get a job (which is what my parents tell me), but I have no time.  I'm an Honors and AP student with a 4.0 GPA, leaving me with barely enough time for sports or sleep.  While my brother and sister have time to work (their course load is a lot less demanding than mine), I'm stuck at home studying every night, and on weekends I'm trying to catch up on sleep.      Is there any way to convince my parents to buy me a car?  Any advice is appreciated.
20090309193345AA5lh84	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Fuel flow problem maybe?	Well we think its a fuel flow problem.  I have a 85 suzuki gs 700.  We took out the carbs and cleaned them, getting good spark, no kinks in the line, new fuel filter.  So we start it up and it starts instantly, runns strong revs ups settles nice back on the idle.  Then after about five mins it dies.  Does this with the fuel cap on, then we tried it with the cap off.  Any ideas on the problem?
20090309191641AARBoHz	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	The needle in my car is raised to the "H" and my a/c blows hot air?	When I initially start my car, it sounds like it's struggling, like it's coughing (hard to explain, yes). And while it's still in park even before I start driving the car or even press on the gas, the needle to the rpm goes crazy and goes all the way up to 3. Also, I noticed today that the needle to the temperature gauge (I think that's what it is) is all the way to "H" and not in the middle of "H" and "C" My a/c starts off cold and then eventually starts to blow hot air. What do you think could be wrong with my car. It is a 2000 Nissan Xterra and how much do you think the repairs would cost? Should I bring it to a dealer or to a Jiffy Lube or something.

20090309185349AAkOnEF	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Motorcycle Passenger age restriction?	My son who is almost 5 has been riding with my husband on his motorcycle since he was 3 years old with full protective gear special pegs and everything with no problem . We would pass cops and they would just smile and wave. Even before we put him on the bike we looked up the laws of age restriction and all the laws required to carry a Passenger in Oklahoma  and have followed every one.. Of course we do not go 65 miles down the highway with him we go around the local park at 15/20 miles an hour. I know everyone has a different opinion on whats safe for a child and I totally respect that.  My problem is today my husband was pulled over by an officer that told him that any child under the age of 6 had to be in a car seat. Which KUDOS for him it is, in a CAR. He did not get a ticket in my opinion because he couldn't because there is no age restrain he probably just though it was unsafe for my son to be on the motorcycle which is fine. I understand that. However he told him if he caught him again that he would call child protective services and nail his @SS to the wall. Any opinions ? Advice ? Resources?

On the other hand, 350z is a little bit slower, much more expensive, and has exactly the same rubbish interior. My friends disagree... so its more a vote then a question...
