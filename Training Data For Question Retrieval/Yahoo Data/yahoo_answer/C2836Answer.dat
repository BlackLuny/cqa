L2t7Ek4paa	Over the summer one year I worked at a poultry factory in the shipping department. They used to put all the left over stuff in huge bins, bones, skin, fat, cartilage etc. When I asked what this stuff goes towards, I was told hot dogs and dog food lol. Oh and apparently Mcdonalds chicken nuggets are a result of the same thing.|`|lTLaQ5i9aa	i can only have one and if i eat 2 i will throw up|`|beO40ap7aa	the only men who love hot dogs like other men|`|JbIXytKJaa	I like conies.|`|H5PFEtVQaa	they are made from butt.i think they smell nasty. and they give me a head ach|`|KDXisAOlaa	i like hot dogs.|`|ANCKG9ywaa	you must be the wrong person at a wrong time...there must be missadding of ingriedients in those hotdogs...|`|9P0ktEbkaa	hot dogs are very gross|`|dqDCIZkGaa	Hot dogs are gross! after i found out what the non turkey dog ones are made of I almost got sick!
856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	LOL...Hmmm, well I am admittedly not an animal lover, but I don't think that chickens HAVE any rights!  They are being raised to be eaten.  Who cares?  I mean, I am sure I will take some crap for saying that...but it's how I feel about the matter.  I certainly don't lay awake at night worrying about Chickens' rights, or feel guilty eating at KFC.  Just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|s34GP3Ioaa	We did pass a law protecting livestock from being tortured last November in California.  Unfortunately we need meat in our diets but there is a humane way of treating the animal while it is still alive.  Last year while watching those film clips of animals being treated cruelly I came pretty close to becoming a vegetarian.|`|3caq6SFxaa	I would venture that KFC is very cognizant of chickens being right tasty.|`|hIuWPD3xaa	A few years ago there was an African American elected to Congress as a Republican (from Oklahoma).
