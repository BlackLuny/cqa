HE23qtamaa	I think you should approach it the way someone who is overweight approaches dieting. <br>  <br>  First, for one week, keep a record of EVERYTHING you spend money on. Everytime you buy gum, or pay a bill, or buy food, or go out... anything. Then at the end of the week, highlight all the necessary expenses.<br>  <br>  The the next week, still keeping track, put yourself on a spending "diet". Only spend money on the expenses you highlighted as necessary.<br>  <br>  The following week, give yourself a small allowance for "unnecessary" things (like going out with friends, or buying lunch instead of bringing your own etc). Make sure it's a small amount, so that you have to consciously make a choice about what you're going to spend it on, instead of mindlessly spending.<br>  <br>  Then, look back on your weeks' spendings (you should still be keeping track) and try to set a final budget, including necessary expenses, an allowance for personal expenses, and an amount for savings. Then, just stick to that budget. <br>  <br>  Once you start seeing your savings growing, you'll feel good - better than you did when you were wasting money.

6XYuqMNMaa	Sometimes, your local (home) bank can offer favorable exchange rate, while sometimes, overseas bank or foreign currency branches can offer better deals (i.e. Travelex in Mumbai/Delhi, especially at the airport).

f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	Go to www.annualcreditreport.com. It is the government-sponsored site that provides a free credit report once per calendar year for individuals who want to pull their report.<br>  <br>  Make sure you access a report from all three bureaus (Trans Union, Equifax and Experian). All three reports should give a detailed summary of the accounts in good standing as well as neagtiave accounts. They will list the creditors and their contact information. If they don't have those details, contact the credit bureau and request more information.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Be wary of freecreditreport.com because, in order to get your reports, you have to sign up for monthly credit monitoring, which costs money and all they do is alert you if something suspiscious ever shows up on your report.  (Which, in my opinion, is too late.  I signed up for Lifelock because I'd rather know about a problem BEFORE it happens rather than after!!)  Anyway, when you get your credit reports, you should be able to print them out.  As you read over each page, it will look a little less confusing and you'll soon get the hang of it.  Each open account will have the name of the bank or lending facility that owns the loan.  For instance, the loan on your car might read "Ford Motor Credit".  It will state when the loan started, what the monthly payments are, how much you still owe, and underneath all that is usually an button you can click on to show a detailed month-to-month record of your payment history.  Sometimes it will just show up without having to click any extra buttons.  Anyway, in the area where it says who owns the loan, there should be a company name as well as an address and phone number.  This is who you contact to find out how much you owe but, like I said, it will already show the amount on your credit report.  If the account has gone into collections, dont contact the original debtor (like Ford Motor Company) because they will have already sold the account to ABC Collection Agency, and it wont belong to Ford Motor Company anymore.  In fact, the area that shows Ford Motor Company will also say "refered to collections".  This is a very bad mark and cannot be erased no matter what you do.  If you want to pay the debt, you have to contact ABC Collections using the phone number provided on your report.  If there is a nondescript company name and no address or phone number, you can write a letter of dipute to the credit bureau.  They have to confirm that the debt is valid but if they cant find an address or phone number either within about 30 days, the debt is dropped from your records.  More often than not though, they are able to come up with the address and can confirm the debt.  You might get lucky though.  Dont just look at your report on the computer....print it all out (even though it will be several pages long) because that's the only way you'll get the details.|`|AA10886262	spend the $30 and go to myfico.com ...it is a great way to get all three credit reports, it will tell you what you owe and to whom, it will show you any hits on your credit, it will walk you through writing and printing letters of dispute.....well worth the money|`|N7G26k4Iaa	On the website www.AnnualCreditReport.com you can get your credit report from each of the reporting agencies free once a year.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	One free report per year per bureau at www.annualcreditreport.com.

AA10874030	I think it is highly likely you will be credit searched for this account. Myself and my husband had some adverse credit issues in two years ago and last year we decided to open a savings account with HSBC. We already have two other savings accounts, a joint current account and another current account each with the bank but they turned us down for this additional savings account after carrying out a credit search! We were so surprised that this had happened! Not only were we already banking with HSBC but it was a savings account so not even an account where we would be borrowing money or having any bills go out from! Banks are incredibly cautious at the moment so even though the current account you plan to open won't have an over draft facility or any form of credit attached to it, it is still highly likely a credit check will be carried out. I would suggest that before you open the account, check your credit rating for free using <a href="http://www.experian.co.uk/freereport/?sc=410008" rel="nofollow">http://www.experian.co.uk/freereport/?sc...</a> where you can get a free report and a free 30 day trial.|`|KQpT68AKaa	That is the easy way. However, bear in mind that some banks are fussier than others. When we wanted to arrange a joint account we found Natwest very bureaucratic and Barclays less so.

You may be able to get a  loan from a credit union or bank at a lower rate than  your credit cards to pay back  high interest credit card debt immediately, or you could take advantage of some offers for low rates for transfer balances.

ASTs can be for a fixed period, usually 6 or 12 months, or "periodic" which means that the tenant can give a month's notice at any time. When a fixed period expires the tenancy will automatically become a periodic tenancy on the same terms, unless a fresh fixed agreement is reached.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the type and duration of AST the landlord cannot ask the tenant to leave less than 6 months after the start of the agreement. In any case, the landlord must also give 2 months notice to the tenant.<br>  <br>  You cannot avoid these rules by going for a shorter fixed period. You had a fixed 3 month period which would have reverted to a periodic tenancy after those 3 months. You should have used a deposit scheme, so you will be liable for the appropriate penalties. It makes no difference that you are willing to return the deposit. The whole point of these schemes is to ensure that landlords put deposit money into them so it is protected from the start.

Even if you run a small company, you should present yourself internationally as a solid and reliable potential partner. <br>  Some little changes and touches will add considerably to your global appearance.<br>  <br>  Adapt corporate stationery to your export activities - add international dial-up code and word "Australia" to contact details. <br>  Develop company logo <br>  Always sign out-coming correspondence indicating you job title, company name and contact details, for example: <br>  <br>  When talking to prospective buyers, don't say "I" - always say "We" and so on. Talk To Other <br>  <br>  Investigate if there is any government programs or other assistance available. Talk to regional Austrade and Victorian Business Centre representatives.<br>  <br>  Most likely, there are companies in your region, which sell similar (but not the same) products aboard. Do not hesitate to talk to them. Successful people are usually willing to share their knowledge and experience. Not only can they advise you on some important issues but also may be able to introduce you to key service providers and potential overseas buyers.<br>  <br>  Learn About Export/Import Regulations And Terms Of Trade<br>  Contact your industry association and relevant export authority and investigate if there are special requirements for your products to be exported. You may need a licence, export permit, veterinary or fito-sanitary certificate or have to meet some other export requirements. <br>  <br>  Austrade and other export bodies will be able to advise you on import requirements and regulations that the selected market may have.<br>  <br>  Contact the Consulate of the country you are going to export your products to and talk to the Trade Commissioner. <br>  <br>  Spend some time to learn about terms of trade and delivery, methods of international payments, International Trade ethics and so on. You should be able to select the most favourable terms and clearly understand the benefits of these terms. <br>  <br>  Hire experienced people or train your staff<br>  Everyone in your company must know that from now on you are a global company. All export inquiries must be referred to appropriate personnel. Do not allow your secretary or a production manager to run your exports and act on your behalf or on behalf of your export manager.<br>  <br>  Exporting is complex. It is essential that your staff know the difference between domestic and international sales and understand the rules and ethics of International Trade and most importantly terms of trade. <br>  <br>  Top of Page<br>  <br>  2. Go Online<br>  <br>  Get a web site <br>  Nowadays, having a corporate web site is a "must" in International Trade. Nine out of ten of your potential buyers will try to learn about your company and products through the Internet prior to approaching you and if they can't find your web site, they may very well choose to deal with your competitors. <br>  <br>  Get an online product catalogue and indicate your general terms of trade to the web site. Provide visitors with direct contact details. Introduce a facility to receive export inquiries. Try to develop a web site, which will not only represent your company and products but also will save your time and money.<br>  <br>  Take advantage of the Internet <br>  There are numerous free online trade boards, import-export directories, forums, etc. Spend some time and post online offers on these sites. Not only it will increase your chances of being found by potential buyers but also will add value to your web site's Search Engine ranking. <br>  <br>  Top of Page<br>  <br>  3. Select And Evaluate Your Market<br>  <br>  Data->Information->Knowledge->Wisdom<br>  Given the number of markets worldwide, which might be showing high potential, the question arises as to how to select this market smartly. <br>  <br>  Information is what you need to select an appropriate export market. And again, using Austrade, chamber of commerce, your industry association, relevant export authority and your colleagues might be of great assistance. Although nobody will give you direct advice, you can get much better knowledge of where to go global.<br>  <br>  Statistical data analysis is essential when selecting the market. You can obtain lots of useful details from the Australian Bureau of Statistics or from commercial companies, wh|`|qcQm8eIbaa	There are plenty of import/export guides out there.<br>  <br>  If your already in India, all you need is a freight checker that you trust on this side.<br>  Or you could use DHL or Fed Ex.<br>  Sell on ebay,<br>  Find a contact here and sell at markets..<br>  <br>  In order for you to get the more specific, you might want to plop down your 'wish list'.<br>  For example, my wishlist is to find an honest, motivated person to find gemstones, jewerly (not cheaply made, but at a very good price), and, ironically, leather goods for me in India.<br>  <br>  They can make sure everything is good on the india side, and I'll take it from here.<br>  <br>  Profits to be split. Percentages to be debated.<br>  <br>  Cottage industries are good.<br>  <br>  It's easy to get 'finder fees' if you know where the seller is.|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	Yes.  you can start export business. Be specific, about, how, where, when you want to do it.|`|yLM1kld4aa	Good idea that you have decided to start export business from India.<br>  <br>  Please note you need to establish a business entity.  Then would select a city of your comfortable.  Relationship with a Bank who may serve you most.  Getting Import Export Licence, VAT licence  etc. etc.  As soon as you get Import Export Licence you can export or import by following the various Rules and Regulations.<br>  <br>  From business entity I mean you have to incorporate either a proprietor, partnership, private limited or limited concern. Though you can form such entity of your own but involving a local person would lessen the burden of formalities.  It is advisable as well as a better option to establish 'private limited'.

EPc8Wvkpaa	Jumbo refers to the amount of the loan, not really the terms.  Both are arm loans, so unless the bank/mortgage company charges more simply because it's a large loan, they are the same.|`|Q7fUgfKSaa	The jumbo is above $729,750.  The interest rate is usually higher than a regular arm.  Make sure that you can afford if the interest rate increases, that's what the problem was with all the loans and why we are in a housing crisis now.
e14ab5e258b448fc37f5f5afda946387aa	There are a lot of factors that make up your salary, not just the MBA degree that you earned. These factors include:<br>  <br>  - the company you work for (even companies in similar industries offer different salaries)<br>  - the country where you work (it's different if you work in the US than if you work in Europe or Asia)<br>  - your experience in Marketing (several companies will look at your portfolio of successful marketing campaigns and will consider those things, on top of your MBA, in determining your salary)<br>  - your personality and your looks (oh yes, they do count specially if you're in marketing!)<br>  <br>  At the minimum, just make sure that you earn at least $5,000 a month when you have finished your MBA so that it will be worth all the years of study and your investment in tuition fees.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you should also start thinking about your bachelor's degree since you cannot earn an MBA without a bachelor's degree. If you want to focus on marketing, maybe you want to consider a communications or economics bachelor's degree then proceed to have your MBA and major in Marketing after college.|`|0b2f3663527edb2b0fe775eae9c9eaf0aa	That all depends on who you're working for--a person with an MBA in marketing can work for anyone who will hire them for marketing purposes.  That means you could be pulling down, say, a mean 24,000 bucks a year doing good work at a non-profit or you could be making 150,000 bucks selling cigarettes to little kids.  I pick extremes for effect, you know.  The majority of jobs are in the middle that pay enough, but not as much as most people want.<br>  <br>  If you take anything from this, the point of most college speakers in high schools is just to get kids into college in the first place.  The fact of the matter is that it's hard to get a job without a college degree these days even though most management jobs don't rely on the skills taught in their programs; after your degree, if you get a job with a large corporation, you'll need to know Excel and Word, but that's it--you'll spend six months to a year in a specialized training program before you're even officially hired.  Every company has special needs that they will teach you when you get there.  The college speakers at your high school just want to get you into a position to get hired, and as such they point out salaries and what not.<br>  <br>  The sad state of affairs, particularly in management, is that your job's salary is negotiated.  That explains, to a large extent, why the ranges are there.  If you go the management route, you will have to sell yourself in a way that differs significantly from, say, a computer programmer.  Programmers need to come in and demonstrate a specific skill (like programming in ASP or database management); if you have that and don't seem to strange, you're in for most jobs to start.  Management has starts, but your salary can change dramatically based on location, skills beyond the managerial, personality, corporate support, rates of advancement, and so on.  Management is the rat race that everyone talks about--you have to compete, looks for jobs you don't want to get a raise, lots of complications.<br>  <br>  The point of all this tirade is that those who are most successful in management aren't the ones with the "right" degree, but those who have the desire and work ethic to succeed.  Degrees, like your college speaker wants you to understand, just open the door--like with any job, you have to prove yourself to get anywhere.  Taken in another way, a recent survey of corporate CEOs tracked that the degrees people had split almost evenly into thirds.  One third had MBAs of some kind.  Another third (mostly the heavy industry companies) had engineering degrees (often coupled with executive MBA programs which are hardly the same as a real MBA).  The other third had advanced (meaning MAs and PhDs) in the liberal arts.  So what's the moral here?  The same thing I mentioned earlier--you have to prove yourself regardless of the degree.  (And as a side note, I would go the liberal arts route, if only because you could take interesting classes, not that advanced corporate accounting isn't interesting...  It just makes marketing more relevant if you know about literature and history.)<br>  <br>  The last thing I would point out here is that in thinking about your MBA, you're skipping a big, big step--what about your undergraduate degree?  You don't need a management or business degree at the undergraduate level to go into an MBA (which I should remind you is a graduate degree).  That's why I mention the liberal arts degree--or sciences or whatever, for that matter.  Do something that you like, then work with a company and have them pay for your MBA.  They're expensive and often very boring.  Why pay for something that you might not enjoy?<br>  <br>  Ultimately what I would recommend is finding some people in your town who do all kinds of jobs and see how they got there.  You will be surprised, I am sure, how some of them ended up doing what they do.  And by that I mean, some engineers wanted to be neuroscientists and some doctors wanted to be poets.  How did their lives end up like that?  A good place to start would be asking your teachers--I am sure the ones that like to teach might have very different stories than the ones who seem to hate kids.  Why is that?  At the very least it will be fun to hear strange stories.  And you can get your teacher off topic for a little while...|`|mnvoipENaa	You need to have a bachelor's degree first before you can enroll in a MBA program. You can get a bachelor's in marketing or any other field. AFTER YOU GET A BACHELOR'S you can apply to a MBA program with a concentration in marketing if you chose to go that route.

1H7aNVT3aa	Their are two big problems the economy faces now.  The first is the traditional problem of recession.  That historically has been fixed with monetary policy (fed lowers interest rates, economy picks up).  Fiscal stimulus has pretty much been discredited as a method of stimulating the economy, its only used as a political sop. <br>  <br>  The second however is that the banking system almost collapsed last year and is very weak.  Without banking the economy shuts down.  So they have to figure out how to preserve the integrity(ha!) of the banking system.  If the american people do not regain solid faith in the banking system, nothing else will work.
3ExcyAJaaa	There are many scam artists who claim it is easy to get grants from the federal government.  The most famous is Matthew Lesko, "the answer guy."  They try to make money off you selling books or bogus services.  Never pay someone to find you a grant.<br>   <br>  In general, it is hard for individuals to get grants from the Federal government.

You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.<br>  <br>  You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	We have not seen any grants for 15 years.

When the deal fell through, I got that money back.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	you should never have to pay a real estate agent any money upfront, or even if you buy a home.  he is paid by the seller, out of the sale price of the home.  this guy's a scammer.  don't do it!|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	don't give him anything in fact report him or her to your local board of realtors or commission, he doesn't get a dime until he sells a home|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Do NOT give this guy any money.  Real Estate agents don't charge to "evaluate" any homes.  What the he** does that mean anyway?  The only time you will give a check to the realtor is after you have found the house you want, submitted an offer, and had the offer accepted by the sellers.  At this point, you will write out a check for "earnest money", which is usually around $500.  The agent doesn't cash it....she holds onto it.  Then you get the house inspected, appraised, and checked for termites.....if it passes all that to your satisfaction, then you sign a contract to buy.  If there are things that don't pass inspection, you either have the realtor negotiate with the seller to fix it, or you have the option to back out and get your $500 earnest money check back.   If the house passes inspection (or all repairs have been made) and you decide THEN to back out, you forfeit your earnest money because you've wasted everyone's time.  The home and termite inspections are done at YOUR cost, and some realtors may let you pay for the services through them, while others prefer that you pay the inspectors personally yourself.  Other than the earnest money, that would be the only other time you'd need to give a check to the real estate agent.  He is actually working for the sellers and is being paid by them to do the job of selling their house.  He should not require any payment made personally to him, from you.  You do not pay the realtor for their services because he isn't working for YOU.  So, once all the inspections and appraisals are done, and the bank does all the required mortgage paperwork, the seller, the mortgage lender, you, and the realtor will all meet together to sign the bottom line.  This is where you'll see your earnest money check again because it will be applied towards the purchase of the house.  You wont get it back, but your house will be $500 less.  Since you are still in the home shoppin phase, be sure to get yourself pre-APPROVED, and not just pre-qualified for a loan.  There is a big difference (look it up).  We lost out on a home because we were only pre-qualified, and another couple who were already pre-approved stepped in and got their offer accepted before we even knew what was happening.  Pre-approved means that the loan is already a done deal and is just sitting there waiting on you to find a house.  Pre-qualified means that the bank has looked you over and they believe you're a good candidate, but none of the official paperwork has been done yet.  (Btw:  once you're pre-approved and the loan is waiting on you, you have plenty of time to continue home-shopping and you arent making any payments on the loan because you havent officially accepted it yet.)  Being pre-approved has so much more appeal to the sellers because it means that there wont be any snags in the financing process, and they can sell their home a lot quicker.  Sorry to get so carried away but you said this is your first home.....just thought I'd give you a few pointers.|`|6LPeWXYuaa	Although not typical, I have heard of some buyer's agents who will ask for a retainer that will be refundable to the buyer at closing of their house purchase.<br>  <br>  I would ask for a written statement of account for this fee and how it will be used.  Any money you pay should be made payable to the agent's broker.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I'm not in favor of this type of arrangement.  Still, if you consider how much time, effort and money can be spent helping "buyers" who are not serious about buying property, or who just want an agent to show them property because their "real" agent is too busy, you could understand why some agents might want to charge a retainer.<br>  <br>  But, a fee for an agent to "evaluate" houses?  Never heard of that.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	In my state it is illegal to take money like that without first having each such agreement OKed by the state Department of Real Estate 10 days prior to the execution.<br>  <br>  Also it is illegal for an agent to take money for services from anyone except his broker.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a scam to me.<br>  <br>  Go to the Realtor Association where this clown belongs and file a complaint.|`|DPajzalfaa	My mom is a Real Estate agent and I have NEVER heard of that! I would report them to the board of realtors! <br>  <br>  When we bought our homes, the only thing we paid was the earnest money when we write the contract. Everything else was financed or paid through the seller. <br>  <br>  DO NOT pay your agent anything. In most scenarios, a buyers agent is free for the buyer- the selling agent gives the buyers agent a percentage of the final sale price.|`|Wuo3Nbfoaa	Find another agent as fast as you can.|`|46ZGLs43aa	Scam!

The bank will not care where the monay has come from , they will get all they can from you into their hands again having just lost loads. You legally went bankrupt under the understanding that your bank account and any money going into it would be frozen and not avaiable for you to get. so sorry but its your fault you will not get it back. <br>  <br>  DLA cannot be your only benefit, so apply for a crisis loan from the social to tide you over until your next lot of money arrives. and make sure it isnt going into the bank|`|L4rlu2BDaa	Legally a bank can't take any money that is a means tested state benefit, which means income support, JSA, housing benefit etc. DLA isn't means tested so sadly they can take this money, if it was put into your account then the bank has alright to that money i'm afraid. To the bank it would have been like you mistakenly putting a months wages into that account, they can have it. So because it's not means tested meaning you get another income from somewhere else, it's there's for keeps. Go and speak to the CAB they might be able to negiotiate better with the bank but i can't see them giving it back i'm afriad!|`|JNDDFz33aa	Well I'm sure you will survive without it.

You will have an advantage over others and be able to excel in your career.  It is possible to get positions in law firms without training, but they are much harder to come by, especially in today's economic climate.<br>  <br>  The Institute of Legal Secretaries and PAs provide a good course and they can help you to find work when you have qualified.  It is very comprehensive and good value for money.

dzG9mIWOaa	Congrats on trying to be helpful to the children of your community!!  As a former nanny, child care can be one of the most stressful yet most rewarding jobs there is.  I would talk with the parents that you are wanting to babysit for first.  Not everybody can afford the same amount per hour.  But I wouldn't sell yourself short either.  I would start by charging at least $10-$15/ hr.  But people are very picky with who they leave their children with.  You should have good references as character witnesses from people who know you very well and would say great things about you.  Good luck with this!!  And when you think you are gonna pull your hair out, count to ten and breathe deeply instead!|`|QwRaFHZdaa	I dont know. The people I babysit for are very generous. When I babysit for for like 4 hours I got like $36(:|`|LBbKmemxaa	Three bucks? More, once you've got an experience bump.|`|u93oneUXaa	You're 13. It's not going to happen.|`|ZJ5SwhmNaa	I used to hire sitters all the time. I did not pay an hourly rate but I did give set amount for services. Most people like to know your are trustworthy first. A suggestion is for you to find a few people in the area who have more than one child. My children go to the sports events in the area and find parents with kids they know. They ask if they can help keep their child occupied during the game. Most parents would be happy. Then after a few times my kids are usually asked if they would like to sit or  kids just ask them if they ever need a sitter to keep them in mind. The price always comes up but my kids usually ask for a $10 minumum. This usually covers 3 hours and a ride to their home. They must provide snacks and a ride home. If I have to go pick them up there is an additional charge. I should also mention this amount is for hours before 8pm. Anything over 8pm I will not let me kids get less than $25 for 3 hours. They have been doing it awhile so they also get $5 each hour after the 3 hours.Good luck.|`|ujtCEmnOaa	The first thing you need to do is get some of your parents friends to let you babysit for them and if you do a good job then you can use them as references for other people. Its easier to sit for kids that you know. It can be very frustrating when you get a child who is more hyper than normal or wants you to let them get away with things they arent suppose to do. As for the money i live in the states and i have 3 kids that are all school aged and i pay my sitter $30 for saturday night when i want to go out. It all depends on the hours and what is involved. Good Luck i think its a great way for young girls to make money. Just be responsible and follow all the rules when in someone elses home.|`|XYQOCP1maa	charge cheap .. 5 bux an hour for these hard econmic times is fair and generous..dont be a greedy *****..baby sitting aint hard labour you know...|`|HEEbJd6iaa	1 dollar for AZN|`|DNknBxRWaa	I babysit for family members every once in a while, i don't ask for money but i usually get 20 bucks a night|`|AA10436868	Not sure about Australia, but when I was 15 I was babysitting(I am a male)<br>    Now that was a while back an I was charging $1 an hour.<br>  I think now days, it would be ok to charge $3 or 5 per hour.<br>    If you personally know a person who you can babysit for and you do a good job, then ask them to recommend your service to other people they know.

The $20 cost is the least of the issues.  Once you are there, expect heavy pressure to sign a contract with the 'loan modification firm'.  That is what these seminars are all about.  For three hours, you will listen to how THEY can 'save your home'.  Once your pump is primed, then they move in the for 'the kill'.<br>  <br>  Most lenders are now refusing to work with third party 'loan modification firms'.

Loan modifications rarely happen.  Your best option is to seek the services of a bankruptcy attorney, who can help you negotiate the loan modification via the threat of bankruptcy.|`|VeDJa0m9aa	There is so much free advice out there, especially from banks and realtors. Try them first or online.|`|ymUiY6E0aa	First, speak with a real estate attorney free of charge. They normally provide a free consultation.<br>  <br>  Secondly, make sure the company that is providing the seminar is accredited. Meaning, see if they are a listed organization and have proper licensing. Check with your local housing authority.<br>  <br>  Third, is the company your current banking institution? I would speak with someone on the inside in the loss mitigation department to confirm that this is legit. Each lender has a loan modification team on staff. So it's pointless for this "so called firm" to try and speak with you about it. They aren't the ones making the final decision.<br>  <br>  It's kind of like speaking with your wife's sister on whether or not you should purchase an automobile. <br>  <br>  a. She isn't the one that you should be discussing this with.<br>  <br>  b. You might be living out of that car, if you don't discuss it with your wife.<br>  <br>  c. Even If she tells you to go ahead, how does someone outside of your relationship have anything to do with it?? You still have to deal with your wife... right?<br>  <br>  Lastly, I wouldn't speak with anyone other than...<br>  Your Attorney<br>  The IRS<br>  Your Lender<br>  In regards to your current mortgage situation.<br>  <br>  You have to understand. There are a lot of people out there looking to profit off of your fears. And I have a feeling that this might be one of the situations. But like I mentioned before. If they aren't accredited or not listed with your local housing authority. I would call a news station or local paper to goto the seminar. <br>  <br>  Your lender should be able to walk you through the process for free. Well, not for free because you have paid them interest and principal payments.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents.|`|EdC9JfIQaa	Is it worth $20 to save your home?<br>  <br>  If you are in foreclosure, I would get as much advice as I could get.

If the former, tax will be increased if you receive untaxed income from another source, or for a man born before 05/04/1935 if his wife dies (thus he would lose age married allowance). A decrease could happen if you were registered blind and got the blind person's allowance, or claim allowed expenses in employment. For the self employed, there are lots of different circumstances where tax bill could be amended.<br>  If you are talking about Government decisions, tax rates are decided on how much income the Treasury needs to raise to spend, but we won't go into the rights and wrongs of that!.|`|Lv1Exqefaa	it depends on your situation

This is very common with contractors or trades people (plumber, painter, etc) who are dealing with a large contract. Sometimes their client will want to be added as an additional insured on their policy so if the contractor causes damage or bodily injury to others and their client is named in the lawsuit because they are the owner of the property, being an additional insured the contractor's policy would respond to cover the property owner.

You could ask them what their selection process was.<br>  <br>  You can't claim or threaten constructive dismissal as that is when an employee is forced to quit their job because of the way they are being treated - I think it is unfair dismissal that you are thinking of, which can be very hard to prove when redundancies are being made.

IIEWut9jaa	Starting a business is not all that difficult. There are many items that must be covered:<br>  1.) Have you chosen the name? Give that some thought, since it will be the name you trade under. It should be a name that can be associated to the product you intend to sell. Research on the web.<br>  2.) You have chosen a name. Now see if the domain name is available for that name ( Business name:My Candles, check to see if www.mycandles.com is available). Web site names should be short with powerful key words. If it's available, buy it. It's only a $3-10 investment. Think about a Brand Name. Try to tie all three together. Research on the web.<br>  3.) You goal is to start a candle, scent and soaps store. I assume you know how to make. Get your suppliers lined up to make sure you can purchase what you need. Make sure you can make a profit on what your going to sell. Test what you make by going to flea markets and you can sell what your making without having to have any licenses.  Research on the web- there are firms that will get you started in the line of business you chose to go into. BE WARY of long term agreements. Think hard and twice before you proceed on these.<br>  4.) Still want to do this - go see an attorney for getting the business established.<br>  5.) Develop a business plan. Research on the web and you will find many programs that walk you through this step. You might want to do this before Step 4 and show your attorney your plan.<br>  6.) Help available:SCORE - an association of retired business execs. that provide guidance to new business owners. Most branches are within a 45 min drive in the Delaware Valley and you can see them as often as you like. Might be a good idea if you go there and see if they have  a handout on the steps to take to start a business.<br>  <br>  Starting a business will be the most frustrating experience in your life and many times over you will ask yourself over and over, "Why did I do this?" Before you even begin the formal process of starting, make the committment to follow through because this is what you want to do.Then NEVER FORGET THAT OR WAIVER from your goal.<br>  A business is like a plant. When young it must be nutured into maturity. One mature it still needs to be taken care of. Trust me when I state it will take tons of hard work to get your business going but well worth the effort in the end.<br>  Example - It took me 2.5 years to get where I am in my business.

bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	The problem is that nobody is talking about nationalizing the banks.  They are talking about nationalizing SOME banks.  This would lead to a problem in competition between banks.  The nationalized banks would have a lower cost of funds because of a government guarantee on deposits of all sizes, even the huge corporate ones.  They would not have to provide a dividend or other profitable return on investment to private investors.  Would they have to pay local real estate taxes?  So, between the subsidy and the need to do no more than break even, the majority of banks that are privately owned and not in trouble would be at a disadvantage.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	If the government buys stakes in banks it would dilute the banks share value.  This occurred with the previous government.  None of the recent nationalization rumors that have manipulated the Dow Jones below its November low seem to have solid evidence.<br>  <br>  A lot of banks like Bank of America, JP Morgan and Wells & Fargo in 2008, still managed to make a net profit and don't need to be nationalized.<br>  <br>  Citigroups which the nationalization commentary is now focused on made a significant loss in 2008, but is still currently financially solvent.<br>  <br>  Bank of America (BAC) is not getting nationalized.  This was confirmed to the market on Friday by BAC CEO Kenneth Lewis in a public statement to stop the chatter and malicious rumors.<br>  A Related Article: <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/business/story/520504.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlotteobserver.com/busines...</a>|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Because a lot of these banks are worth less than zero.  And US taxpayers will end up with huge debts if they nationalize these banks.  Huge government debts will have to be paid with higher taxes.  Which will damage the economy.<br>  <br>  Nationalization is different from buying in that the shareholders get nothing in exchange for the transfer of company ownership.  And when shareholders think their shares might become worthless, then many of them sell their shares at cheaper and cheaper prices.|`|msNXomjTaa	It isn't.<br>  <br>  However, the American economic system is based on free enterprise.  That is, little government influence or regulation, and no government companies.  <br>  <br>  This was one of the problems in the current meltdown.  For example, Canada has private banks, but strong government regulations on banking, and Canadian banks were unaffected by the economic crisis (except those with American holdings).  Other countries with nationalized systems were also less affected than in the US.<br>  <br>  The problem would be in the States, where government has only a small role in business, that it would introduce something completely different.  Americans are simply not accustomed to do business like that.|`|AA11458280	Nationalizing insolvent US banks is the best solution to avoid a Japan-like scenario in which 'zombie' financial institutions would eat up public resources while the US economy would teeter on the brink of depression, Nouriel Roubini, economics professor NYU and chairman at RGE Monitor told CNBC Tuesday.|`|9m96dsZIaa	There are many reasons but perhaps the most convincing is that other nations have tried it before and failed miserably. France tried it in the 80s and ended up making banks private again. <br>  <br>  Banking is a very tough business (as more people are finding out) and it's questionable whether the government could operate one on such a large scale. In addition, with government ownership comes lots of inefficiencies and red tape. It would almost surely fail.<br>  <br>  Nationalization would also keep private investors out.

3d1f72430429084db8cea464a5353369aa	DO NOT address something like this in an email.  Do your homework and get your "beef" together on paper including everything that you want to "complain" about or discuss with your supervisor.  Include only facts and behaviors.  One thing we have no control over are personality conflicts and rumor/hearsay.  Only when you have put together a rational, unemotional presentation should you ask your boss for some face-to-face time at HIS/HER convenience.  Have you asked your boss during times of evaluations/appraisals exactly WHY your performance has not merited a raise?  Your boss is doing you a disservice if he/she has not given you clear expectations of what it would take to improve your pay.  I can assure you though, one way to get your boss to NOT appreciate you is for you to blind-side him/her with a confrontational storm of accusations and complaints.  To get respect you must give respect;  if not to the person, at least to the position.  Good luck!|`|MLaYRGdcaa	if they value u ?, they will.<br>  if not!, they won t.<br>  find out whom their tuffest 2 competitors is.... and tell the sexist boss that your offered x percentage more to jump ship/shift camp....<br>  providing you bring your experience (trade secrets) with you.<br>  <br>  or....<br>  <br>  say to him that you went out to dinner as a invited guest and a offer was made...u had no idea who invited u, but you got told later.it was a competitor.........dont mention name just keep them (boss) guessing!.<br>  <br>  what u call a bluff...some fall for it due to panick.|`|76gi1C7Faa	Never put anything negative  in writing that could at some point be used against you. Calm down, get your facts together, ask your boss for 10 minutes of his time, and proceed with your case. But, do not accuse, nor bring up others, as they have nothing to do with you. <br>  You are there for you only. You are there to show how you and you alone deserve a raise. You will get nothing by putting down others. Make sure you have facts showing how you deserve anything however. Show where you have saved the company money, or made them money. Talk about your strengths.|`|da59b44452c599e7a03e6a7a72f23754aa	Bosses all over the world adore people like you. You do all the work and never complain and you certainly don't do inconvenient things like asking for pay rises. I'll  bet you also work weekends and rarely take a sickie?<br>  You need to be assertive with your boss and ask for half an hour with him/her. Think of all the things you're unhappy about and want to discuss. Avoid discussing other people though. He'll probably be shocked. If nothing improves after about six months then it's sits vac time. People like you will always be employable.

I have worked here for only 5 years, but 5 years or some pure bull crud at times.  Its Heaven now, but it not always was.....  Many have left my position too, due to caddy biotches trying to take control.  You are dealing with a control freak.  She is used to running people off and getting away with it.  The key is to be nice as pie, and that will keep the big dogs (bosses) off your back.  AND- seems how she is buddy buddy with the bosses, you wont gain ANY points by revenging on her or being snide, your boss will only see you as the bad guy.  Remember, the most important thing is this is your JOB.  a way to pay for your life, but by no means is this job your LIFE!!.   If it is seriously getting too hot for you, get out and dont look back.  But if you think you can hang, or try to keep with it, it will pay off in the end.  She will eventually give up because you wont cave in to her crap.  Be nice, but dont let her run over you.  She will have plenty of rude stuff to say to you, but let it roll off your shoulders. She is probably a miserable scum bag in real life, outside of work, and this is how she makes her self feel better.  If you want to play her game, you can start CC the boss every time anything leaves your desk, so this way you will let them see whats up.  But this runs the risk of being too pushy.

What is the current hospital rate for a heart attack? I was working two jobs just in case one ended or I got laid off.  I was not happy but I had more money coming into my household.  I had to re-arrange my priorities and cut back on extras if I wanted to be happy.<br>  <br>  I started with making my breakfast in the mornings vs buying breakfast in the cafeteria.  I took my lunch to work and heated up in the microwave.  I took a thermos of coffee or soup to work.  I had to think before I spent any money for miscellaneous items.<br>  <br>  I use to laugh to myself of how other workers were always complaints about the food in the cafeteria and how much the catering truck was charging for fruit or sandwiches.<br>  <br>  Life is short so enjoy it each day,  peace of mind is priceless.

This stock is for the amatuer investors and arbitrage.  Most of the people that trade a stock like this are operating on the "hope" or "wish" or "expect" concept of investing.  This is not investing. This is not trading. This is gambling (with very poor odds). Spending your time (and mine) on this turkey... when there are soooo many other real oportunities.... is just not smart for your financial health.

AA11966821	Are you certified and/or licensed as a Certified Nurses Aide or Home Healthcare worker?  In most states you need a license except maybe for "companion care" -- to live in someone else's home and help with cooking, housework, taking them shopping, etc, without any medical care.<br>  <br>  Live-in is good since it eliminates huge expenses: rent & utilities.  But the pay is very poor anyway you look at it.  A nurse on in-home assignment will do very well, however.  You would need to be licensed at least at the LPN level, perhaps RN.<br>  <br>  Agencies take a pretty steep whack out of what they charge the client.  But most work like this goes through agencies since they pay the worker, along with dealing with taxes, SocSec, etc.  And they verify licensing and references.  So you pretty much have to go through an agency to get these kinds of jobs.  Companion care might be based on referrals -- "friend of a friend needs someone..."
HFKr2vBsaa	If you have your address on your resume then they know where you live and are probably aware of a need to relocate. So the fact that they want you to interview is a good sign.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't bring it up in the interview unless they bring it up. Talk about your skills and abilities, ask questions about their business, etc.<br>  <br>  If they bring it up, then you can see if they wish to help relocation. The rule of thumb is to not bring up salary/benefits, etc. unless they mention it first. Relocation is a benefit if they are helping you pay for it.  If not, they will probably give you a little time to move if they really want you.<br>  <br>  But don't sweat it on the day of the interview, they will sense your unease. Concentrate on selling yourself.|`|J1Frx83haa	I doubt that they will wait, as the economy is right now, no one wants to wait,<br>  but i would just take it as a normal thing, dont tell em yet, try and commute back and fourth.

However, the best tip for getting round that is to apply for a few at the same time. Because Experian, Equifax etc only update every 30 days the other searches wont show up until then so neither will know about the other when you apply if you do them together.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense|`|vY0ScgeXaa	i heard that federal credit report is FREE, but it's not specified, and for some newbies, it's hard to read.<br>  <br>  credit score analysis is different, and offered by commercial analysis agencies, they are for-profit, so you gonna pay for that score or stuff.|`|HSjaI8SFaa	<a href="http://www.freecreditreport.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.freecreditreport.com</a>|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Credit expert will let you see your score for ￡5.95, and also offer advice on improving it. To see the report is free for the first 30 days, and then something like ￡6.99 a month thereafter. So you could sign up for the free trial, get your score and advice all for ￡5.95. So a slightly cheaper option. <br>  <br>  However, just to complicate things, bear in mind that sometimes even people with a really great score still get refused credit. That's because they are literally so good at paying, that companies realise they won't make much out of them in late fees / charges etc.  I know, ridiculous isn't it.<br>  <br>  When I have been refused credit in the past (only twice mind, lol), and I've tried to find out why, I've found the credit card company says check with experian/equifax etc, then they say check with the credit card provider. Everyone seems to be a bit backwards about coming forwards with their reasons. One said it was a problem with my overdraft (there was in fact no problem at all with my overdraft) and told me to ask the bank. The bank said ask the card provider. eugh.<br>  <br>  Another note - credit/loan providers tend to concentrate on the last 6 months of your report, so if you do get turned down, wait 6 months and try again. <br>  <br>  You can also add a statement to your credit report (200 words max I think) in which you can describe reasons for late payment, and why you feel able to take on new credit etc. If such a statement is attached to your report, the creditors will automatically do a separate, individual review on whether or not to grant credit, rather than basing their decision on your credit rating alone.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	they don't consider that your circumstances have changed the computer tells them if your points are high enough to get a loan but with defaults and late payments you wont get them, my friend had a perfect credit rating and was refused a bank loan - maybe when the credit crunch is over you might have a better chance.

If so, do you have someone who can look it over?  A real estate agent might charge you a flat fee to represent you and help negotiate and close the deal.  Otherwise, you should probably take the offer to a real estate lawyer to review.  <br>  <br>  I would ask the Broker to provide a pre-approval letter from a lender, if financed or proof of funds, if a cash deal.<br>  <br>  When did you buy your house?  Did you pay someone to do the renovations or did you do them yourself?  $16,000 for renovations doesn't sound like a lot of work was done, given what costs are to hire someone to do renovations/remodel.  If you did them yourself, you may be underestimating the value of your home, and $320K is a more reasonable offer to make.<br>  <br>  Is the RE Broker making the offer for himself as the buyer or is he representing a buyer?  If the latter, the buyer may be looking to pay this much.  If for himself, I'm surprised he started with such a high offer, unless you have owned it a while and house values have appreciated that much since you bought.<br>  <br>  As suggested by another poster, you probably should see if there are any major improvements planned for the area that might make the offer price low.  In addition to any roads or schools, you might want to check on any new employers planning to move into the area.  There may be something planned that will cause property values in your area to rise in the near future.<br>  <br>  Other questions - Do you want to sell?  Where will you move to with $66,000 in your pocket?  Will you be expected to pay a commission to the broker?  (If he's representing a buyer, you probably will.  If he's representing himself, you shouldn't have to.) Do you think the house will appraise for this value, or is this a cash sale?<br>  <br>  If you don't want to sell, or can't get another house that you like as well for a good price, you might want to think twice about his offer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6g1MUG5xaa	check with REAL real estate broker, It may be on good land<br>  <br>  |¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨---<br>  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__<br>  |__________________|||_|___|)<<br>  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|AA11922860	if you do sell make sure you go through a real estate lawyer or yes you could be scammed big time!!!|`|cMsC5a14aa	Probably but it sounds like a good deal for you anyways

That will suffice for now.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	You should have received something from the unemployment office with the amount of compensation you received and the amount of tax they took.

AA10729675	Stimulus is a Latin word, which we use nowadays concerning the senses organs like sight or touch, or smell, in a scientific context, especially in laboratories.<br>  When we want to use this Latin word as a base in the meaning of encouraging, or emulating, or revigorating, than, we use the Latin word stimulation, stimulate.<br>  So, in my opinion, applying "stimulus" to economy is preposterous.<br>  Preposterous is the use of this word on a linguistic level, preposterous it is also as for what it is supposed to mean, suddenly, in 2009 with a new government.  Again in my opinion, I think the economists are the ones to blame with their ignorant use of semantic, and of economy.<br>  And I wonder why we should pay on account of the ignorance of the economists.  I wonder why economists should be so ignorant and unefficient.  In fact, it's been a month now that I do not stop wondering.  I am like in a daze in front of so much ignorance.  It is not the stimulus, it is the ignorance which I find absolutely overwhelming.|`|PpheQM2naa	I believe that it is a huge waiste of tax payers money, I.e. bailing out the auto companies.

It will kill your credit. I think they can garnish 10-25% of your wages. Not sure what else they can attach. The banks give it to a collection agency after 90 days late then they can take out a judgment against you. I plan on moving and leaving no trace so it might be hard for them to find ME.|`|XmHEYD9Waa	If it is just a temporary thing, then you can contact them and arrange for deferment or forbearance until you are employed again.  They'll basically halt your account, interest and all, until you can "resume" it again.  Some companies can work out other deals.  They want your money and they'd rather put you in deferment than default you. This may prevent a bad situation from getting worse, but it'll only put it off for so long.<br>  <br>  If you can't pay, you can't pay.

Cite the laws of your state, stating that the landlord must return the deposit within (whatever amount of) days and that since they failed to do so, they cannot retain any portion of the deposit. Demand that the full deposit be returned within X number of days or you will file in Small Claims court. <br>  <br>  If the management does not return your full deposit, file in Small Claims. The cost is minimal and if you win the court fees are added to the amount that they owe you. <br>  <br>  Also, check your state's security deposit laws carefully, you may be able to sue for double or triple the amount of the security deposit due to their failure to follow the law.|`|auegTf2iaa	They are looking to keep your sec deposit.<br>  The only way to get it back is to take them to small claims court.

There is no right or wrong. If you use a bull spread where both legs are in-the-money (ITM) then it is relatively less risk and will have a lower reward. In will not require the stock price to move and will make money from the passage of time. (In option trading terms, it will have negative gamma and positive theta.)<br>  <br>  If you use out-of-the-money spreads (or if the short leg is OTM) then you will need to have the stock price move significantly. It is higer risk and will have higher rewards.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, whether you use the debit or credit versions depends on which spread offers the best set of risks and rewards. Buying the call spread is identical to selling the put spread. Theoretically, they should both have the same max loss and max gain. In the real world, you'll find that the volatility skews make one version (debit or credit) better than the other. The main thing to understand is that you should not trade the credit spread "just because" it is apparently better to receive money than to spend it.

IzCCoKNoaa	Strategic management is the art, science and craft of formulating, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions that will enable an organization to achieve its long-term objectives[1]. It is the process of specifying the organization's mission, vision and objectives, developing policies and plans, often in terms of projects and programs, which are designed to achieve these objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the policies and plans, projects and programs. Strategic management seeks to coordinate and integrate the activities of the various functional areas of a business in order to achieve long-term organizational objectives. A balanced scorecard is often used to evaluate the overall performance of the business and its progress towards objectives.<br>  <br>  Strategic management is the highest level of managerial activity. Strategies are typically planned, crafted or guided by the Chief Executive Officer, approved or authorized by the Board of directors, and then implemented under the supervision of the organization's top management team or senior executives. Strategic management provides overall direction to the enterprise and is closely related to the field of Organization Studies. In the field of business administration it is useful to talk about "strategic alignment" between the organization and its environment or "strategic consistency". According to Arieu (2007), "there is strategic consistency when the actions of an organization are consistent with the expectations of management, and these in turn are with the market and the context."<br>  <br>  “Strategic management is an ongoing process that evaluates and controls the business and the industries in which the company is involved; assesses its competitors and sets goals and strategies to meet all existing and potential competitors; and then reassesses each strategy annually or quarterly [i.e. regularly] to determine how it has been implemented and whether it has succeeded or needs replacement by a new strategy to meet changed circumstances, new technology, new competitors, a new economic environment., or a new social, financial, or political environment.” (Lamb, 1984:ix)[2]

This means that if notice is served you will have to surrender the property. This is normally listed under 'special tenancy conditions', at the end of the agreement.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	depends on where you are.  in most places, you would continue to pay rent up to the date that title reverts to the bank.  once this happens, tenancy becomes void.  you would then be given a notice to vacate.  if you don't vacate in this amount of time, you would be evicted.  then, the sheriff would be called to remove you, with only what you could carry.  <br>  <br>  don't let it get to this stage.  you'd be wise to start looking for a new place right now.|`|ogX7TdKPaa	I am a landlord and as far as I can remember it will be up to the possessor whether or not they want to keep you on as a tenant.

They said its a delay in processing, and i still haven't received anything yet but be patient is what everyone is saying its hard to when you have been laid off from work and you are depending on that money to pay your bills. So i would suggest you sit back and enjoy the long ride of waiting this is crazy.
snh9wzpnaa	You need to put the proceeds of the sales, which would be the $5242.  Then you need to put your cost, which would also be $5242 if you sold the stock as soon as you got it.  The dates of purchase and sales would both be "various".  You want to do this under the "short term" section of Schedule D.  If you do everything right, you should have a $0 bottom line to that form because you sold everything at the same price you received it.<br>  <br>  For your example, see IRS Pub 550 ( <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf</a> ) page 68.|`|AA11555162	If there were any fees for buying and sellling then add those to the costs.|`|Khw12uheaa	Thank you so much for all the information given and for the link to the Schedule D form filled out.

Your withholdings are based on the allowances you declared on your W-4 and what you made that week.  Each check is taxed as if that is your only income and it is projected out to an annual income (multiplied by 52 if you are paid weekly).  If you made minimum wage (say $7 an hour - to use round numbers) for 10 hours a week, you would make $7 x 10 x 52 = $3640 for the year.  If that is you only income for the year, which is what they assume, you would owe no tax for the year, so they withhold none.|`|88Dt6CGqaa	It also depends on how many exemptions you have.

Have two forms of identity with you (in addition to your social security card).   Typically you will have a conversation with the lender about why you are borrowing, how much you need, any collateral you have, and how you plan to pay back the debt. You will fill out an application, youre credit will be checked, and depending on the type of loan other steps could be involved (i.e. a commercial loan would require financials, tax returns, balance sheets, aged AR etc).....if you have any more questions feel free to call a community bank in your area - they typically have more freedom to lend on logic and will be able to explain the process in depth.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|yCWjBrjnaa	In this present climate I wouldn't bother.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a secure Job.

You don't, however, say how you'll make your money.<br>  <br>  It isn't necessary to set up a limited company to run a business.  You can trade under your own name or a company name that you choose, provided you show your name as the proprietor.<br>  <br>  Another consideration is the type of customers you're dealing with.  If you're running something that's primarily business to business, it can help your prospective customers' perception of you to be a limited company.  In other words, they're then dealing with people like themselves.<br>  <br>  If you're in the UK, speak to your local Business Link.  They'll go through all the pro's and con's of the different types of company.<br>  <br>  The main thing is to keep your business and personal finances separate.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	No in the US, but maybe if you are in the UK.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No.  Virtually all mortgages have "due on sale" clauses.  Any title transfer is a "sale."|`|AA12252493	Sure it can.   But first, you have to find a willing and able homeowner in another area willing to do the deal.  The exchange will be considered a sale of the house and you'll need to satisfy the balance of your mortgage, presumably through a mortgage on the other home.  The additional costs, such as closing and contracts will be more than in a conventional buy/sell, as your lawyer will need to write a different contract than usual.  The real issue, will be finding a swapable house and a willing seller in similar circumstances.   There are tax consequences too, as the swap will be considered a 'sale'.  If your house was used for commercial purposes, or a rental, then you may have to pay capital gains taxes.    But, most of all,  this arrangement will not solve your problem, if the value of your house and the new house have both decreased so much, that neither you nor the other guy, have enough equity left to cover the debt.    Moral of the story....  nothing goes up forever without risk,  even real estate.|`|pNy8lakjaa	Its hard to do, but yes it can be done. I know of 2 homeowners in Illinois, after much debate, were able to do this.
y4SUDnpaaa	I hate to be the one to impart bad news but here goes, you cannot sell the car unless it is paid for and get a clear title. No one is going to pay more for a car than it's worth, so you could take the sales money and pay the amount still owing out of pocket to pay the loan in full. You said you were majorly upside down so that's probably not feasible. If you let someone just take over the payments without the lender approving that the person is credit worthy and financilly able to repay the loan, you  be liable for the debt since the loan is in your name and you could not give the person a clear title, so you would basically be loaning your car to someone when you are resonsible for the payments (they could stop paying them) amd the car is your name making you responsible for anything that happens to the car of anyone in it in case of an accident.You could only refinance the blue book value of the car, not what you owe so you  which means they would not have the  title to secure the loan, because the car still wouldn't be paid off . If you have the savings to make up the difference in what you owe and what the car is worth some of these options would work. No one is going to pay or refinance a car for more than it's worth. A voluntary repo is only slightly better than a normal repo and will affect your credit about the same. If the car is repossessed they will sell it at auction, turn it over to collections for  and come after you for the difference in what they sold it for and what you owe. If the collection agency won't work with you on a payment plan, and they probably won't, after going throgh all the legal steps they could garnish your wages or put a lien against your home. I wish there were other options but my son is going through exactly the same thing right now and due to go to court to tell his side of the story to the judge next week.He doesn't  own a home so he expects to have his wages garnished.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	I would first try and sell the car, to get as much as you can.  Whatever it sells for, give that to the car company.  It will look a little better on your credit that way.  If you have 3,000 to purchase a car, do that, its better to have a free and clear vehicle than a car payment.|`|x3fQP9viaa	Try to sell it, and talk to the loan co. about that amont being your pay off amount. <br>  <br>  A v.r. looks better on a credit report, not that any look good.  <br>  <br>  Before you get behind try to refinance your home loan, even a few percent sounds like it could save you.|`|23xC6I2Gaa	Have you considered refinancing the car at a lower interest rate? This would lower your monthy payments.<br>  <br>  Or try selling the car - the buyer would just take over payments - so you wouldn't make any money off of the car, but it's still better than a repossession. <br>  <br>  Of course a voluntary repossession is better than a forced one... but I would try other options (especially selling the car) before giving it back to the bank. But I understand your situation, and if all else fails, you may have to voluntarily reposses it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9AGTYeU7aa	A repossession voluntary or not affects your credit the same way. If you give the car back to the bank, they will sell it at auction for much less than what you owe on it. You will be responsible for the difference of your loan balance minus what they got for it at the auction. So you will not have a car, but you will still have to pay the bank.<br>  I would call your bank and tell them the situation. You may be able to work out a temporary solution till your husband gets a job.  They may let you refinance, lowering your monthly payments. Don't wait, make the call now and work something out. Good luck.|`|Hx88UGlpaa	As the other posters stated, try and sell the vehicle first. Even though you are upside down on the loan, you can try and re finance the vehicle in order to reduce the monthly payment. You can try Capital One Auto Finance, they are pretty fair to deal with and have re financing available. You can check them out at CaptialOne.com  Worse case scenario, you let it repo, they will sell it at auction, and you will be responsible for the debt. Other than paying the debt, they can/will sue you and garnish wages and or bank accounts up to 100% if the balance is not paid to them. I highly suggest you sell the vehicle or re finance. Other than paying it off in full, the only thing that will get rid of the debt is a bankruptcy filing. A repossession stays on your credit report for 7 years, and the bankruptcy for 10 years. Try and sell or re finance. Another suggestion, call the loan company and see if you can defer a payment to the end of the loan to make it easier until he finds something else. I just did two..one for our vehicle and one for a motorcycle loan without any problems. We've paid on time for both and my hubby was laid off 3 days before Christmas, so, I called and had no problems deferring one payment for each and that has helped out a bunch. I didn't like doing it, but did what we had to do to get caught up...luckily, my hubby is back to work and we'll do just fine. Here's some options for you, hope it all works out!  Good Luck!!
AA11966821	One of the biggest complaints new nurses have is the lack of on-the-job training.  You are pretty much thrown into the snake pit and expected to carry your weight from very, very early on.<br>  <br>  No surprise.  As govt funds dry up, insurance companies go bust (or cut/delay reimbursements to cover up their dreadful balance sheets), illegal aliens won't pay for medical care & Americans cannot pay for their medical care, hospitals are going belly up.  They are closing emergency rooms/trauma centers, slashing staffing, and generally looking to cut their costs.  And that, too, leads to skimping on training for new nurses.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Many hospitals offer new graduate RN programs. They often hire a large group of new grads and put them in a cohort together. You might all work on different units, but once a month or so they have classroom sessions and bring the new grads together to discuss relevant topics to being a new RN, providing extra support. And a good hospital will have a flexible orientation period when you are new. Ideally you should be paired with one or two experienced nurses on your unit who you work with side by side for many weeks. In the beginning it is more observational as you learn your role, but slowly you will be expected to perform independently with the experienced RN just observing you to make sure you are clinically competent. If you interview for a hospital, ask them about their orientation process. If they tell you it's a flat out 2-4 weeks with no reevaluation to see if it needs to be extended, that's a bad sign. A hospital should always be willing to work with you and extend your orientation time if you need it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6fiYhtACaa	Yes! I live in the midwest and hospitals here are already telling May graduates to apply now. Marc is right about Chicago, but it is really the exception in the US. California, Arizona and Florida are ALWAYS hard up for nurses. Most of the country is willing to train new nurses just about anywhere and in any state. Keep in mind that you will have to get licensed in every state that you work in although some states share reciprocity. If it doesn't matter where you end up, I'd try California. I worked as a travelling nurse there for 3 years and I worked with foreign nurses from Australia, Great Britain, The Phillipines, Korea, Nigeria, Kenya, New Zealand, Ecuador, Mexico, Iran and more that I'm sure I've forgotten. Many times, I was the only US born nurse on the unit. I'm sure you won't have a problem as long as you are earnest and work hard.|`|5c70e4a7234f0be8642df55ef4a96e46aa	You can try getting an internship for a few months or work as Certified Nursing Assistant for a while. That way you gain more job experience and the hospitals are more likely to hire you.<br>  However, if you get accepted you will have orientation for the first week or two and then for 3 months you are supervised by another nurse.<br>  <br>  In Chicago, believe it or not, they are firing nurses from all hospitals. Every major hospital in the city fired 200-300 nurse. Supposedly, it is almost impossible to get a RN job here as a new grad. I don't know about ohter cities but  I am sure it's the same thing.<br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.monster.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.monster.com</a><br>  its the best site for nursing careers

KGCih5BTaa	You are never going to get market value for your gold.  A lot of people forget that it is a business and there are expenses.  About 2% of the gold immediately evaporates upon melting, market price may drop, rent, assay fees, permits, labor, taxes, etc etc.  Also market prices are based on 1,000 ounces of bullion (bars, coins etc) on a trading level.<br>  <br>  If you have one ounce of jewelry, and gold is $1,000 a ounce you don't get $1,000 for that jewelry.  Most jewelry is 14k gold and that is only 58.5% pure gold.  <br>  <br>  10k- 41.7% Gold<br>  14k- 58.5% Gold<br>  18k- 75% Gold<br>  22k-  91.7% Gold<br>  <br>  I am a refiner and diamond buyer in Florida, and will give you the information you need to sell your items without getting ripped off.<br>  <br>  Gold (Based on todays price of $993/oz)- 10k- $9 gram, 14k- $13 gram, 18k- $17 gram.<br>  <br>  Silver- 925/Sterling- $9 a ounce.<br>  <br>  This is the absolute least you should get per gram. A lot of places buy it according to pennyweight (DWT) to convert grams to pennyweight just multiply the gram price by 1.55.<br>  <br>  I pay around 6% more than the numbers I listed above for 100 grams of gold OR LESS, if you 100-200 grams I pay 10% more than the prices above, 200 grams or more 12% more than the prices above. <br>  <br>  I buy from jewelers, dealers, pawn shops, and the public all over the country.  If you know the approx weight and karat of the gold I will pay you PRIOR to you shipping your items using paypal.  If you dont have a scale I send them to customers FREE OF CHARGE!  If that sounds like something you would be interested in doing call me anytime.  My number is tollfree.  (877) 487-1386.  Either way I hope you get a fair price no matter who you sell it too.  Just Do YOUR RESEARCH!!!<br>  <br>  A few last things.  If you have any gold or silver coins or bars (bullion) you should get about 1%-2% below market value if they are pure gold (most are)  since they do not need to be melted. <br>  <br>  Also now is NOT the time to sell anything but gold, silver or platinum.  If you have diamonds (larger than a 1/2ct), or a high end watch, KEEP THEM IT!!  Wait until the economy rebounds a little.  You would get half of what you would of got 6 months ago for them!! <br>  <br>  Lastly, and most important. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT, sell to cash4gold.com, goldkit.com, goldpaq.com, and most other commercial sites like that.  All you have to do is look up the complaints most of these companies have and will see what a scam they are running.  The prices they list on the site are not what they will pay you.  I'm sure there are legit sites out there but before you sell LOOK THEM UP to see how many complaints they have recieved.  Complaintsboard.com has the truth about what 80% of these sites are REALLY doing.  The owners should be in jail!!! (Just look at the link above with the "gold price calculator" someone posted.  Now read the terms.  The prices are VERY GENERAL and are based on 10 ounces or more of gold!!  Who has 10 ounces of gold jewelry!?!?  Whatever price they give you expect to get 300% less, no joke!!  And that is being modest, seriously)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	You can use this tool for estimates:<br>  <a href="http://www.goldintomoney.com/calculator" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldintomoney.com/calculator</a>

457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	How much time are you taking off for the appointments, and how frequently is it happening?<br>  <br>  Most employers will allow a salaried employee some time to pop out now and then for a doctor's appointment.  Especially if its only an hour or two, and it happens infrequently.<br>  <br>  However, if you're frequently taking a few hours away from the office for doctor's appointments, then I can't say that I blame your employer for wanting you to use vacation time for the appointments.<br>  <br>  You should check in the Human Resources section to get the full scoop on the legality of your employer's request in your specific situation.  There are very specific rules regarding salaried employees and time off...what sort of increments they can require you to use the time in, etc.  Yes, an employer can require that you use vacation time when you are going to be out of the office...but there are also specific rules they have to follow to stay within legal boundaries.|`|6mVpfmR6aa	I do not know what country you live in.  <br>  <br>  In the US your employer can do whatever they want.

d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	Q: How do you make a Small Fortune in the Stock Market?<br>  <br>  A: Start with a Large one.<br>  <br>  Before you invest learn everything you can about a company, what they make their market, who the competition is etc. <br>  <br>  Only invest money that you can afford to loose. Consider it race track money.  Don't invest any funds that you would need to use in less than five years. (Don't invest your rent or mortgage payment).<br>  <br>  You can educate yourself on technical analysis (Charts) and other trading strategies.  In fact it is a good idea to follow a stock for awhile to see if you can spot any trends.<br>  <br>  Penny stocks (less than a dollar) are risky and are not as easily traded and usually have additional charges applied to trades.  Penny stocks also run the risk of being delisted making them harder to trade.<br>  <br>  Definitions:<br>  BULL MARKET - A random market movement causing an investor to think of himself as a financial genius.<br>  <br>  BEAR MARKET - a 6 to 18 month period when the kids get no allowance, the wife gets no jewerly and the husband gets no sex.<br>  <br>  Profit - an archaic word no longer in use<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would rather see you save money in a nice safe bank and build your funds up to a level where you could invest in a higher quality stock. Don't be in a rush to jump into the market. Consider a blue chip company like DOW was trading around $36/sh only a few months ago is now around $8/sh.  A petro chemical company such as this would benefit from an economic turn around but only after a few qtrs of sustained growth and profit.  Meanwhile SAVE, watch a few key stocks, learn about these stocks and don't be in a hurry to pull the trigger and buy.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	well here is a risky stock, "sirus XM" is on the verge of bankrupcy, there sock has dropped to about 5 cent, but direct tv is going to lend them a lot of money.  do eithe rthe company folds and you lose your money, or they can make a small move to say 8 or 10 cents. might not sound like alot but thats 50% profit over 5cents.

B1UcaukFaa	No, you must close on the property before amending your taxes.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Several problems with what you just said:<br>  <br>  1. No you can't claim ANY tax credit until the deal is final and closed. Deals can fall through even after an original agreement is signed, to the tax laws only recognize the sale after its final.<br>  <br>  2. The tax credit for 2008 taxes is $7500, not $8000. Plus its really an interest free loan that you have to repay. <br>  <br>  3. The new tax credit for 2009 is in fact $8,000 and does not need to be repaid. Therefore it only makes sense to take the 2009 credit because its more money and you don't have to repay it. However, you can't claim this credit until you file your 2009 taxes next year. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is there is no possible way to use the tax credit as a down payment.|`|FCnhnZ6Eaa	This website should answer all your questions, or rather your friend's questions: <a href="http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/2009/faq.php#21." rel="nofollow">http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/2...</a> Regarding your friend's particular situation, here are some relevant passages:<br>  <br>  "First-time home buyers purchasing any kind of home—new or resale—are eligible for the tax credit. To qualify for the tax credit, a home purchase must occur on or after January 1, 2009 and before December 1, 2009. For the purposes of the tax credit, the purchase date is the date when closing occurs and the title to the property transfers to the home owner."<br>  <br>  - So, it looks like you can't claim the tax credit until the closing occurs.<br>  <br>  "Taxpayers buying a home who wish to claim it on their 2008 tax return, but who have already submitted their 2008 return to the IRS, may file an amended 2008 return claiming the tax credit."<br>  <br>  - Once you close on a house in 2009, you can file an amended 2008 return and get the credit instead of waiting to file your 2009 return.<br>  <br>  And, now for something really special:<br>  <br>  "For a home purchase in 2009, can I choose whether to treat the purchase as occurring in 2008 or 2009, depending on in which year my credit amount is the largest?<br>  Yes. If the applicable income phaseout would reduce your home buyer tax credit amount in 2009 and a larger credit would be available using the 2008 MAGI amounts, then you can choose the year that yields the largest credit amount."<br>  <br>  - This essentially means that you can use either your 2008 or 2009 adjusted gross income to claim the credit. For example, say, you were married and were on pace to earn 175000 in 2009, but your AGI for 2008 was 145000, You could use your 2008 AGI to claim the full 8000 credit, whereas if you had to use 175000 as the AGI for the credit, you wouldn't get anything.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11173563	no as it was not part of last years tax base.

iUm5qWBraa	Word of Warning!...  If you're being paid in cash does that mean that there is no withholding (taxes, social security, etc.) being taken from your earnings?  If so, you're going to be in trouble come tax time if your employer reports your earnings to the IRS.  You need to check on that ASAP!<br>  <br>  Now to your question...  The first thing you need to do is set up AT LEAST a savings account - & a checking / debit account wouldn't be a bad idea either.  After receiving your Fri. cash stop by the bank on your way home & deposit some of your money, setting aside ONLY what you want to spend over the weekend.  When that is gone, stay home!

Should you decide to go via Roth-IRA, your money grows tax-free forever.<br>  <br>  You save, quite easily I might add, because:<br>  <br>  1) You don't spend what you don't see<br>  <br>  2) As the name implies, it's a retirement account so legally, it leads to number<br>  <br>  3) You can pull money only at age 62 1/2 (with a handful of exceptions)<br>  <br>  It's simple really.  It's the classic sage advise, "Pay yourself first."  By setting up an IRA, that's EXACTLY what you're doing.  Automatically.<br>  <br>  By your current actions, do you realize that you're paying The Mall first?<br>  <br>  Trust me, it'll only 'hurt' for the next 2 paychecks.  After that, you won't even miss it while your money grows through the magic of compounding interest which Albert Einstein said is one of the greatest forces in the universe.<br>  <br>  By the way, Wall Street's current doldrums make nowadays the perfect time to set up an IRA since everything's marked down.

Those questions need to be answered first.  <br>  <br>  If you were the personal guarantor and neither you nor the business have declared bankruptcy he can file suit against you for actual damages but not for the duration of the lease unless it is vacant for the full 5 years.  After he does so you need to take a look at all your options.  Your failed business has probably caused other unpaid debts as well.  Then you have to decide to pay up as the loser of this and any other suits or declare bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  That is the short version.

It's business, not personal. You signed the lease for 5 years, you agreed to pay for 5 years.  <br>  <br>  Now, as far as how to get out of it...  see if you can find someone to assign the lease or business to.  If you find someone else to take over the lease, the Landlord may let you out of it.
etV271ARaa	Your question is the typical Republican/Democrat question. Bush's top-down approach of pumping money into the banking system and hoping it trickles down to the man on the street in the form of loans didnt work coz the banks were hoarding capital and paying fat bonuses to their top executives. Obama's bottom-up method of  directly creating employment by repairing bridges,highways and lending money to state govts and municipalities to rebuild their infrastructure will work. Its how Harry Truman stimulated the economy in post war America. Employment, not giving money away. That really will never work

RqQDKEVHaa	One question:<br>  <br>  What are the comps?<br>  <br>  On a short sale, asking price doesn't matter. While the seller has to sign the contract: (1) the seller won't receive a penny, whether you pay $190,000 or $290,000, and (2) any sale is contintingent on bank approval. So asking price is totally irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Also, short sales take time. If this were a "normal" sale, I'd say that being on the market for 118 days indicates it's overpriced. But it's possible that other offers have come in already.<br>  <br>  Get your own real estate agent. Determine what the real value of the property is. Then make an offer either at (if you really love the house) or below (if you're looking for a good value). Just don't pay one penny more than it's worth. And you have no idea whether it's worth $290,000 until someone runs the comps.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA10886262	pretty house!  do your homework and find out how much similar homes in the area have sold for....I have a home for sale and would not expect someone to put in an offer for exactly what I have it listed for....in this market.

nmozvlGPaa	Maybe.<br>  <br>  Usually when I read these questions about people who's homes now appraise for much less than when they bought, it is people who are still able to afford the payment and I get a little ticked off at their brazen disregard for their financial obligations.  <br>  <br>  Your case is different.  You also experienced a reduction in income.  The things that you are contemplating to stave off issues for a couple of months are short-sighted and dangerous.  Sometimes amputation is the only way to save the patient.  Selling your car would probably net you a lot less than you think and greatly reduce your flexibility.  So would taking out the personal loan.<br>  <br>  You need to make a fast decision.  I would look into the stimulus package and Obama's proposals to help distressed homeowners.  Figure out if you are likely to be helped or not.  Then (and this is CRITICAL) you have to figure out if that help is enough for you to really be able to still afford your home.  You need to be honest with yourself.  If your interest rates goes down a couple of points, the payment would surely drop, but would it drop enough?  <br>  <br>  The market will not recover in 6 months.    It will likely be worse in 6 months.  Any 'stop-gap' measure like a personal loan or selling your car will only buy you a few months.I was reading about FHA guidelines that are going to be increasing interest rates on loans that have less than a 25% downpayment which will make home less affordable for people in general.  <br>  <br>  So, if after your honest assessment you realize that you still won't be able to afford the home you need to prepare for life after homeownership, including having a lot of money put aside to find someone or somewhere to rent to someone with bad credit.  <br>  <br>  Just be aware that as soon as you start missing payments your credit rating will crash.  It will affect any outstanding debt you have (especially credit cards which will shoot up in interest rate).  Your insurance could cost more.  Your job or future job prospects could be limited by your bad credit.  <br>  <br>  good luck! - you are going to need it.|`|auegTf2iaa	No, they will reduce your rate with the new Obama plan and make your monthly payment more affordable.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Don't listen to Judy..

ikXRqWxUaa	1.  many purchase agreements are contingent to successful financing.  most of the time, the buyer has already been pre-approved, but that is by no means final approval.  <br>  <br>  2.  the figure of 1-2 percent is what i remember for earnest money.  if the sale doesn't go through, than the buyer gets that money back...as long as the contract is written well and the sale fell through because of a valid contingency.  the buyer can't simply say "i changed my mind" two days before closing.  <br>  <br>  3.  i assume that you are talking about the home inspection, not the final walkthrough, which typically happens within 24 hours of closing.  many purchasing contracts are written contingent to home inspection.  this means that depending on what the inspector finds, you can negotiate repair concessions or even get out of a deal if there are too many things wrong with the home.|`|6LPeWXYuaa	What does your real estate agent advise?  If you do not have a real estate agent representing you, I strongly recommend you get someone knowledgable to protect your interests in this transaction.  The commission is generally paid by the listing agent (who represents the Seller) sharing with the buyer's agent.  So it usually doesn't cost the buyer any extra money to have representation.<br>  <br>  You should have a pre-approval letter to be in the strongest position to write an offer to buy a house.<br>  <br>  It is not required, but many sellers want to see this before they will accept an offer and take the house off of the market.  <br>  <br>  In the case of purchasing a foreclosure property from a lender (called REO property or HUD home), they DO require that you have a pre-approval/pre-qualification letter.  Some even require that your pre-qualify with their own company (such as Wells Fargo, Countrywide or Home Path), even if you do NOT use that company for your mortgage loan.<br>  <br>  Earnest money deposits vary.  Where I am, typical is 1% - 1.5% of the sales price.  But it can be as little as $100 - $500.  This is money that will be used for your costs to complete the purchase, and can be claimed as liquidated damages if you default on the contract and fail to buy the house.  The more Earnest Money you offer, the better you look to the seller (whether a private owner/seller or an REO owner).<br>  <br>  Usually a buyer waits until there is a fully executed contract to have a home inspection.  If you have concerns about the condition, you may ask a contractor or other repair company to give you an estimate if you like.<br>  <br>  Again, your best source of information and advice is your real estate agent.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gYRfWcleaa	A Seller won't accept a contract offer without the buyer being pre-approved for the mortgage. <br>  A normal deposit would be anywhere from 1000-5000. You want to make your contract contingent upon an inspection so you can make sure that there are no major problems with the home and if there are that you can back out of the contract or have the Seller contribute to the repairs.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Most contracts are "subject to financing."  You can be pre-qualified but you can't be pre-approval.  To obtain mortgage approval there must be a specific property under contract.  That said, many of the bank owned (foreclosure) properties require "proof of funds" at the time an offer is tendered.  The earnest money deposit is negotiable but usually it's around 5% of the purchase price.  Your offer should also be subject to a home inspection with results to your satisfaction.  Again, many of the bank owned properties will permit an inspection but won't allow you to cancel the contract.  You should retain a Realtor that represents buyers.  It won't cost you anything because the seller pays the commission and a buyer's agent has your best interests in mind.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor

Daq9gituaa	Excerpt from Yahoo! Finance news article:<br>  <br>  Question:<br>  "I will qualify as a first-time homebuyer and am currently set to get a small tax refund for 2008. Does that mean if I purchased now that I would get an extra $8,000 added on top of my current refund?" - Adam Billings, Knoxville, Tenn.<br>  <br>  Experts: Robert Dietz, economist, National Association of Home Builders. Answer:<br>  Yes. Taxpayers get everything they're already entitled to plus the credit. Think of it as a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your tax liability that continues beyond zero. So, if your total tax bill is $5,000 before the credit, your tax bill drops below zero and the government owes you $3,000.<br>  <br>  If you owe $5,000 and had $5,100 withheld during the year, you would ordinarily receive a $100 refund but instead, the IRS would cut you a check for $8,100. If you had $4,900 withheld and would have had to send the government $100 when you filed, you would get $7,900 back.<br>  This refundable feature is very favorable to first-time homebuyers because the credit will give the majority of them more back than they paid in. It is also applicable to 2008 or 2009 taxes, so taxpayers who have already filed for 2008 can file an amended return and get the credit.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeti...">http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeti...</a><br>  <br>  Use the current 1040X|`|0uWqjL2raa	Special election to treat purchase as made in prior year.<br>  In the case of a purchase of a principal residence after December 31, 2008, and before July 1, 2009, a taxpayer may elect to treat such purchase as made on December 31, 2008. <br>  <br>  If you qualify th 2008 credit of $7500 and you purchased after you filed your taxes or you forgot the credit,amend on a regular 1040X and enclose the form 5405 This credit has to be paid back over 15 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The new credit-For eligible first-time home buyers who purchased a home after Dec. 31, 2008 and before Dec. 1, 2009, the stimulus bill provides for a refundable credit equal to 10% of the purchase price of the home, up to $8,000. <br>   And, yes, unlike the credit provided last year, this first-time home buyer credit does NOT have to be repaid, unless you sell the home or it no longer is your principal residence within 36 months of purchase. <br>  If you purchased after Jan1 2009,you will want to wait and get the credit on your 2009 tax return.<br>  <br>  <br>  Christine EA Master Tax Advisor<br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|DGY5vrIUaa	Are you looking to increase the amount of the FTHB to the 8k cap or you just did not put down - 1040X if you forgot - good luck - this year seems to be a waiting game for sure|`|cMsC5a14aa	I use Turbo-Tax software $50 at Wal-Mart it finds all the deductions and money the first time no forms needed

If you take a job and don't like it, you just call the agency and tell them. But one thing, if you're not working or the agency doesn't have anything, you have to keep calling the agency to "check in". I'd look into it. I found some awesome jobs while temping and that lead to permanent full time work.

The employer that fired me said it was due to absentee which I never missed a day of work! I was harassed everyday. When I was pregnant with my first child I was harassed everyday. I worked up to the day I had my child. I had a job where I was on my feet 8 hours a day. They didn't accomodate me in anyway. They expected me to do just as good as everyone else while I was 8 months pregnant with a big ole belly!

If your landlord chooses to, s/he can force payment, or sue you for it if you don't have it, and win, even if you move out way before the end of the lease.<br>  <br>  But most landlords aren't ogres. They just want their money. If the place is in good shape, he may be willing to release you from the lease if another tenant can be found, especially if you're the one doing the finding, showing the place (which is clean and shows great), at your own expense and inconvenience.<br>  <br>  The thing to do is to speak to your landlord, ideally in person, explaining that you don't want to cheat him/her but that you're in a financial struggle, unable to fulfill the terms of your lease. Ask what it would take for you to be released from its terms.

RyyDI1Rbaa	Geographic segmentation is a method of segmenting your market based on geography. This is basically about dividing the large group of people that you're selling to into different physical areas. This method is used because people in one area have different buying habits from people who live in another.<br>  <br>  Example: Mcdonalds sell burgers all over the world. But burgers are made from lamb rather than beef in India because of religious sentiments. In Mexico, more chilly sauce is added to burgers and so on.<br>  <br>  Market segmentation is essentially "selling to people in the way that they want to be sold to." Geographic segmentation realizes this concept across physical locations.

I don't know how to give you advice other than to tell you to sit down and think about what you would enjoy getting up and doing 5 days out of the week.  Also consider how much money you want to make, and how much (if any) schooling you are willing to go through.  A good place to research careers is the Occupational Outlook Handbook (search for it on google/yahoo).

This is the best available as far as I know. ￡14billion sounds a lot but if you consider that about ￡260billion was lent last year as mortgages, it's not and may go very quickly.  At that rate you'd obviously need ￡12,000 for your deposit.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Of course another point is this:  Is this the time to buy?  If house prices have sunk as far as the will then the answer's definitely yes, if they'll sink further then the house will lose value and you could have got it cheaper later on, if you can get a mortgage at that point.  It's a gamble.  Personally I don't think that they'll drop much more now but it's not for me to decide this.

Daq9gituaa	Excerpt from Yahoo! Finance news article:<br>  <br>  Question:<br>  "I will qualify as a first-time homebuyer and am currently set to get a small tax refund for 2008. Does that mean if I purchased now that I would get an extra $8,000 added on top of my current refund?" - Adam Billings, Knoxville, Tenn.<br>  <br>  Experts: Robert Dietz, economist, National Association of Home Builders. Answer:<br>  Yes. Taxpayers get everything they're already entitled to plus the credit. Think of it as a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your tax liability that continues beyond zero. So, if your total tax bill is $5,000 before the credit, your tax bill drops below zero and the government owes you $3,000.<br>  <br>  If you owe $5,000 and had $5,100 withheld during the year, you would ordinarily receive a $100 refund but instead, the IRS would cut you a check for $8,100. If you had $4,900 withheld and would have had to send the government $100 when you filed, you would get $7,900 back.<br>  This refundable feature is very favorable to first-time homebuyers because the credit will give the majority of them more back than they paid in. It is also applicable to 2008 or 2009 taxes, so taxpayers who have already filed for 2008 can file an amended return and get the credit.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeti...">http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeti...</a>|`|LCqiO7O3aa	That's what I heard.|`|B1UcaukFaa	Yes, here is the IRS link:<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=187935,00.html?portlet=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...</a><br>  <br>  The credit is meant to be applied for your 2008 return.

QoVL5cDHaa	There wouldn't be any tax or NIC due on ￡1500 a year! As you say the job is full-time, I assume you left a zero off.<br>  The second job should have a straight Basic Rate (20%) deduction for tax. So tax liability will be the same as if you earn all the money at first job. You can currently earn ￡6035 a year before you pay tax. That is your personal allowance, and will only be available at main job. The ￡6475 comes into force on 6th April next.<br>  NIC is treated differently. Each job is treated separately. So you can earn ￡105 a week before paying NIC. After this you pay 11% of the excess. In April, it goes up to ￡110. So you are better off NIC-wise than if you had the same amount of income at one job.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	it depends on what your tax code is - so I presume the above figure is ￡15,000 and not ￡1,500!  You will pay basic rate on your part time job at (I am not sure exactly) but it's about 23%.<br>  Your first job will have the first ￡5500 (approx) depend on your code but you then pay what you earn above this figure.  But 2nd job will pay about a third in tax and nat insurance|`|at3fTytsaa	No, they would pay the same amount of ta as if they earned the total of the two jobs from the one job.<br>  Do you mean ￡15000 a year? If so, their top rate of tax would be 20% and they would also pay 20% on their second job. They would not pay NIC on the second job if they earned under ￡97 pw in that job.|`|26864d65d58271ca44e00e9d7936f50caa	YES! ITS ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU EARN.

I think this year it is set at ￡6475.  Your tax code will be set for the beginning of the new tax year, always April 5th. I had a member of staff who worked for me and for someone else and the Tax Office split their tax code between the two jobs, as she started paying emergency tax. If you won't earn that amount in the tax year then you shouldn't pay any tax, but you may be liable for National Insurance contributions.  I should phone the tax office and ask them, they are extremely helpful.|`|Y6l76s1Zaa	You are only liable for income tax when your TOTAL annual income exceeds your personal allowance. Look at your tax ref number and simply add a zero to the end to arrive at your tax-free annual income.<br>  <br>  If you are being stopped Income Tax on ￡1500, I suggest you have a strong word with your employers!!!<br>  <br>  A similar principle applies to NI
nmozvlGPaa	First of all, I would really, really recommend against it.  There is a tremendous amount of risk involved even when everything is going in the right direction (which you stated you realize that it isn't currently doing that right now).  <br>  <br>  You need a lot of knowledge that you don't have right now.  You need to have a good idea of value in your area and being tied in with or even being a real estate agent or an appraiser would be a great start.  If that doesn't sound attractive, you could get involved with the other side of the equation and learn more about the construction aspect learning how much it costs to do different jobs with different types of quality in the construction.  <br>  <br>  There are business groups that meet and discuss things for all kinds of different businesses and it is likely that there is a local 'support' group for house flippers too.  This might be a good place to meet the network that you'll need to be successful, but it also might be a good place to meet a successful investor.  If you find a successful investor who is willing to mentor you, that would be an ideal case.  Consider doing some 'bird-dog' work (scouting work that is busy work for the investor) - you will have to bring something of value to the table to make it a more equal relationship.  <br>  <br>  As with any business venture - knowledge is power!  Start learning!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ikXRqWxUaa	i think that right now, you should concentrate on getting your diploma. that should be your priority.  a degree is something that nobody can take away from you and will give you more options in case real estate doesn't work outl.  in your spare time, work on saving money and researching the process.  find people that are successful in this realm and get them to mentor you.  there are many variables and issues that can happen in this process.  you are right not to start this now...as very few are making any money house flipping in this market.
dRezbY31aa	You can use your HSA account to pay for any medical charges for your daughter, whether or not she is on the same medical plan and whether or not they have gone to collections. You cannot, however, use the HSA account to pay for any charges for services provided prior to the date the HSA account was set up. See the IRS publications 969 and 502 for information on these accounts.

AA11206283	Most will; with an option to review at 3 months.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	That will get their attention.  If you're talking about a six month lease that will work, but if you're talking about prepaying on a longer lease, the landlord will still want to see a source of income.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|auegTf2iaa	Yes, when I did it - I offered 4 months advance at a time..    Its sort of a renters market right now - so you have the upper-hand.  Nothing is renting here where I am..

Remember, take digi pics of all things wrong with apt when you move in and have the landlord sign off on pictures showing the damaged areas..|`|mldo1vxYaa	You should be fine, you could always suggest paying 6 months rent upfront and he can review the lease after 6 months if he wishes.

1hciyvKdaa	Its very common for the Feds to take a few years if not many years to find out about issues, the states usually notice it a few years before the federal, if you have fed problems, you probaby have state too, state will grab money before the feds, funny they did not let you know. It may be a flaw in thier software. Get out the last 7 years of taxes and see how it all looks. Stay on top of this, so that you do not get wage garnishment out of the blue. I would contact the state and see whats going on with them too. But first, look and see if you can find the issue. You may have to hire and certainly benefit from hiring a tax lawyer or call a tax person and see if they can help you find issues, assuming you have all your paper work etc. My ex got hit 9 years after not filing corrctly or the lack of. Were you, are you married. You can be hit for work and income a spouse incurred too. Marriage is a bond, and money is the most common bond.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	sounds fake if they didn;t send you an official notice showing the years, tax, penalty and interest - they would be calling you, they would only be sending you notices, with which you can then work out a payment plan IF you really owe them the money|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Of course they can tell you from when.  IRS does not send a bill for "no particular tax period."  If you call the toll free number, the representative may not be able to tell you why, but can tell you if there is underpaid tax or additional tax assessed for a particular year.|`|MgAWGwW4aa	If it is the IRS, they should be able to tell you from when.  Did you get a letter or a phone call?  If it was a phone call, it could be a scam.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it takes a couple of years for back taxes to catch up but you should have something in writing.

The tax would be flat and so would you.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	One proposal is 30%.  It is called the "Fairtax".  The 30% would be on top of any state and local sales taxes already in place.<br>  <br>  In theory, it replaces individual income taxes, payroll taxes and corporate income taxes.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, it has no chance of passing.|`|oumzIRauaa	Such a system would be ideal, if only our politicians could be trusted to save for a rainy day. You see, as the economy goes up and down, so would revenue from a sales tax. If governments could save money in a rainy day fund while times are good, they wouldn't need to raise taxes or cut services. Since governments aren't good at saving, it seems that this system could be a formula for financial disaster.

pNy8lakjaa	It will be really hard for a credit card company to give you one with the collections on your record, it will stick there for 7 years. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to go with a secured card, i.e. Bank of America, where you give them lets say 400 bucks, and that is your credit limit. They will report to the credit bureaus if you pay on time or not, and it will slowly improve your credit. Its not a lot of money, but it will help you get out of minor emergencies if you have one.|`|5BmnSiqUaa	Missing data.<br>  <br>  Why do you need new cards when you have 2?<br>  <br>  Myth:<br>  Getting a new card raises credit scores.<br>  <br>  Fact:<br>  The LENGTH of your credit history matters more.  <br>  <br>  If you get a new card, that's the least important to your Fair Isaacs Company (FICO) score.  In fact, it'll drop your score for 3 months.  Thus, your oldest card is actually your dearest friend.  Should you decide to discard cards (no pun), always discard the newest card.<br>  <br>  Also, did you know that you can FIRE collection agencies?  Yup.  They have no legal standing against you.  You never contracted with them - the card did.  If you tell them AND write to collectors saying you refuse to deal with them, they have to stop.  Have to.  If not, report them to your State Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission.<br>  <br>  So, if you can somehow negotiate with your OLDEST card to activate/reactivate/keep you, that's your best bet.<br>  <br>  Finally, it's not the number of cards that raises your score, it's your AVAILABLE credit.  The farther under you are from your credit limit, the higher your score.  So if they can see that you have, say, 75% credit available (unused), that's a high score.<br>  <br>  The old saying's still true, "They only lend money to people who don't need it."<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
q0oZ8eOzaa	First off, tell them the truth. Tell them that you keep your work and private lives separate and that you don't want to offend them but that you diligently guard your privacy. This will close the door on them asking you for the number and close the door on them inviting you all the time.<br>  <br>  When we have a seemingly negative statement that we need to give someone we tend to try to make it less painful by giving them only part of the message. We could tell them that our phone is for emergency use but then they would keep asking us to join them for a social time. <br>  <br>  Eventually we have to just tell them that 1. I'm not giving you my cell phone number and 2. I'm not interested in a social relationship with you. Isn't it just easier to just tell them that up front. Lying about things or giving them only part of the message is only going to make things worse.

Ipods don't exactly say to someone, come up and say hi or approach me with a question.<br>  The professional appearance trend has been moving back to formalism since the crash of the dot com companies.

3tuwWidiaa	First, don't limit yourself.  Fill out applications for as many places as you can.<br>  <br>  Second, if you've already applied to these jobs and have no heard about an interview, wait about a week after your submitted the application and then call to confirm that they received the application and to ask about next steps.  The manager or human resources office will likely tell you that they'll call you if they want to interview you.  Thank them, but understand that the decision to interview is their's.  Unless you happen to be something special, in which case you can remind them of what makes you particularly special, there's little you can say.  What's special?  You've had significant prior experience, you've a national expert on the products, etc.  I'm guessing this is not the case with you.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that, with the economy being what it is, there are people who have 15 years of management experience with major corporations that are now willing to work for minimum wage.  Who should they hire?  Someone who has an excellent track record, or someone with no experience?<br>  <br>  So, how can you better your chances?  Show that you are eager and excited.  Someone that's taking a job with a $100,000 decrease in pay isn't going to be happy at the job.  And will likely be looking for another job.  On the other hand, you're excited about this and will not be using this as a temporary way to pay the mortgage while you wait for an executive position to open up.<br>  <br>  What to wear: you don't need to wear a suit jacket, but do wear dress clothes and a tie.  You want to look mature and responsible.|`|DF22BQ3yaa	I would suggest you get your foot in the door anywhere you can and establish a great track record with a employer (in which you best fit with). <br>  <br>  In the case of an interview, you should dress your best as the first impression is an lasting impression. A nice pair of dress pants is fine with a nice dress shirt and tie, the jacket is not at all needed. <br>  <br>  Since you do not have any job history, explain to the employer (in your interview) how you have exemplified strong leadership abilities in your community, at church, at home with family (etc) as well as your strong ability to make decisions. <br>  <br>  You will do fine as it sounds like you have your head on straight and your priorities in order.<br>  <br>  Good Luck as you find your first job.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	Fill out your application neatly and be complete.

3m6XHotKaa	In my personal oppinion HSBC is one of the best banks you could be member of in Hong Kong because:<br>  <br>  1. Bank account is free of charge (to open it you have to make a HK$500 deposit though) (for foreigners anyway)<br>  <br>  2. This bank has branches all over Hong Kong (way more than most other banks) and it also has branches in most other international cities.<br>  Making it really convenient to use and preventing you paying extra fees for withdrawing your money from a different bank.<br>  <br>  3. You can also use HANG SENG BANK branches to withdraw your money without paying extra fees, with gives you extra coverage.<br>  <br>  I have so far made only good experiences with HSBC, which I cannot say of other banks I have tried. <br>  <br>  But in regards to your question, I believe it depends on your purpose of opening the bank account.

The maximum maturity age is 70 years and maximum term is 35 years. Since you are 37 you can take a 33 year term policy. The risk cover is 250 times of the monthly premium. So at a monthly premium of 4000 thousand you are eligible for a risk cover or 10 lacs. An equal amount of DAB is also available for Rs.50/lac. <br>  <br>  Thepolicy  can be surrendered without any surrender charges after 5 years. After 10 years the policy can be surrendered with the benefit of all bonuses. There is an option of partial withdrawal once in year. The premium will also be reduced proportionately. <br>  <br>  The policy is eligible for a guaranteed maturity SA.<br>  If the policy holder dies during the term the nominee is paid SA+LA+premiums paid till date minus the first year premiums.<br>  <br>  have a nice day!!!|`|v0jePDOcaa	Buy jeevan Saral Plan from LIC.<br>  You can opt for a term of 25 years.

AA10944766	CFA is Crap - use that certificate as toilet paper now. It is geared towards the securities industry and they are all being made redundant now. Usually the front officesales people do it because they aren't clever enough to get a masters in quant (Financial engineering, Maths or Physical Scieces) or can't afford an MBA from a top school eg LBS, Columbia etc. And with the recession for at least the next 2 years the sales guys will be laid off. Th only place for CFA is in Ops (back office) but if there is no front office or with outsourcing to India those jobs will soon go!  <br>  <br>  ACCA is not a premier qualification despite what that institute boasts - its always second rate to ICAEW in UK, CPA in USA, and CIMA globally.<br>  <br>  You are far better off doing a PhD in Economics with a specialism in Econometrics which will pay the most of the 3 quals and open the most doors for you!

3uI0JAAwaa	It will get better, and the amount of experience that you are getting is valuable.  I would stick with it, and then look to move into a position with an Operator.  If you have the field experience, a solid educational background, and a good reputation, then you should have any problem getting out of the service side of it all.  It is always better to be the company man.|`|osj6pGzJaa	If you're currently being paid above average and can make it on that, then stick this one out for a couple years.  Get that often required experience under your belt, then you'll have grounds and experience to request more from your current company or any new company to which you apply.|`|XChiSgDZaa	You could always stay, but still look for greener pastures and if you find one then jump on it. Although 2 of my brothers work in the oil field one as a hot oil-er, the other as a operator of a rig. The one that is the operator once told me that it is a very physically demanding job and doesn't seem worth it but when the first bonus comes around it puts it all in prospective, and his first bonus wasn't until he was there a year and he has now been doing it 5. I think it mainly has to do with your wants if you feel you need to move on then move on.|`|mO7FOXNYaa	First things first - DO NOT quit this job unless you have another one lined up.<br>  <br>  That's simple enough, right?<br>  <br>  Next, submit your resume to different companies. I recommend using your own time to do this work. It could come back to bite you in the butt if your current employer finds out you're seeking other employment while on the clock (and it would suck even more if you don't get any other job offers!).<br>  <br>  If you go to any interviews - ask about bonuses, benefits, the "training" involved, and how long until you reap all of the benefits. Now that you have had this experience, you know what you want and don't want.<br>  <br>  If another company wants to hire you - make sure you give a professional notice to your current employer.<br>  <br>  I think if you are not happy, then definitely look for other work. It is very common for people to snoop around the job market - even when they LOVE their job.<br>  <br>  *One thing that I'm not clear of, though. Do most oilfield companies require you to work from the bottom up? It's hard to supervise others if you have never done that job. So maybe there is a chance that you will have be a roughneck, then derrik hand, then tool pusher, then driller, etc etc etc...  (if that's the kind of work that your company does).|`|D4XWrwuaaa	My dad always told me it never hurts to listen, so I would suggest you look for other opportunities and go on interviews to hear what they have to say.<br>  <br>  There is nothing forcing you to take another offer, but it would at least let you compare your current situation with other opportunities out there. Then you would either realize where you are is a good place to be or that other opportunities are better.<br>  <br>  For the record, more money is not all you should consider. I have 15 years under my belt, so take it from me, sometimes enjoying your job means as much. As long as you are making enough to pay your bills and put some money away as well, then be sure to consider work environment, co-workers, boss, etcetera when you look at other places. You might get an offer of more money, but if you get to the new job and hate who you work for or the work environment, then it really won't be a better place then where you are now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Your question is interesting as it is nothing wrong with seeking new employment endeavors to better yourself but let me tell you what I pointed out in your question. <br>  It sounds like you were enjoying the job (as you may still be) and giving your job your best until you found out one little thing, the pay. Does the pay or skills in your current job attract you most? I do not see anything wrong with looking for a position in one of the other companies but listen "the grass is not always greener on the other side" as I'm sure you've heard before. If you do decide to seek new employment, make sure you have your questions ready. Has the companies that do the same work as you do stable? Have they had any company layoffs? How do they pay their new employees concerning bonuses? Will you be eligible for them (the bonus) immediately no matter if you're a new employee or not?<br>  All I'm saying is, reconsider your thought to find a new job right now as the economy is going through a tough time right now. Do not make your career about how much money you make but the self-satisfaction you have in your job and the overall happiness. <br>  Maybe since you mentioned that your boss is aware of the bonus structure with other companies (like the one you work for) you can speak to him about what it is they offer (once you get the facts) vs. what your boss is giving you. Maybe this will help you make a decision.

pNy8lakjaa	You would be a month to month tenant subject to the whims of your landlord. If after one month, they don't like you there, they can give you another 30 days to find a new place. <br>  <br>  Never agree to this, a lease is there to protect your rights and their rights.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No lease means he can raise your rent every month.  Kick you out into the street tomorrow  The risk is all on the tenant.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	I would refuse it. Its okay to do a short term lease or even a month to month lease, but you should have something in writing. <br>  <br>  If you do enter into a deal with no written lease, then you are legally considered to have a verbal month to month lease, and local laws (mostly at the state level) will dictate how any disagreements are settled. No lease deals end up in court way too often, I would insist on a written lease, even if its short term or month to month, because it outlines the expectations for both parties.|`|vCePK8gMaa	In most states, no written lease = a default month to month oral or verbal lease as governed by your state's landlord tenant laws.<br>  <br>  You still have basic rights and protections under the law. The landlord still has basic rights and protections under the law.<br>  <br>  Your rent cannot be raised nor can you be thrown out at the landlord's whim. You are legally entitled to proper written notice to increase the rent or terminate your tenancy - usually one rental month, but it does vary. <br>  <br>  The same is required of you. You cannot just move out without notice. You are required to give the landlord proper written notice to terminate your tenancy.

5BTKscZraa	Trying to negotiate a settlement prior to a court date is a tricky matter..be very careful about signing any document that the other side gives to you for any last minute settlement....Don't sign any document that you don't understand. These types of documents usually involve waiving all your legal rights and authorize the other side to get a summary judgement if you do not pay on time.<br>  <br>  Hire an attorney if you can afford one, if you can't:<br>  <br>  Send this debt collector and the court a letter via Certified Mail with Return Receipt (NOT regular mail) stating:<br>  <br>  Notice of Intent to Defend<br>  <br>  I cannot officially respond to your claim until validation is made for the alleged debt. I am officially requesting validation of your claim, to include:<br>  <br>  - A copy of the original application with my signature for this alleged debt<br>  - How much was this debt purchased for?<br>  - Provide a fully itemized statement for the amount you are asking which clearly details how this amount was calculated, including the interest rate being charged.  Confirm that this rate falls within NY State usury limits<br>  - What is the “Date of Last Activity” being used to calculate the Statute of Limitations for the alleged debt<br>  <br>  This letter has been mailed via Certified Mail with Return Receipt. Receipt of this letter is being officially documented.<br>  --------------------------------------<br>  * DO NOT sign your signature on any document that you mail to a debt collector. It could end up on a forged document that can be used against you. Simply type your full name.<br>  ---------------------------------<br>  Fill out the response to the court the best that you can. Also mail this via Certified Mail with Return Receipt<br>  -------------------------------<br>  <br>  On the court date: DO NOT be a no-show under any circumstances whatsoever. Not showing up is the worst thing you can possibly do. Even if you are frightened....or you're sick with a 102 degree fever...or if you think that you'd loose anyway...show up anyway! If you don't, the other side will get a default judgement and they will get this on THEIR terms. They will tack on all sorts of add-on fees and the amount of the judgment could end up being two or three times the actual amount of the debt.<br>  <br>  On the court date:<br>  <br>  - bring complete documentation of your income and living expenses: Pay stubs and copies of bills. Even if you loose, you can use this to negotiate much more favorable repayment terms. Request the following info from the other side on the court date:<br>  <br>  - a copy of the original application with your signature<br>  - a fully itemized statement for the amount they are asking which clearly details how this amount was calculated, including the interest rate being charged<br>  - How much was this debt purchased for?<br>  ===============================<br>  Lastly....if they take you to court and win a judgement, this will authorize them to freeze your checking accounts....To be safe, this might be a good time to start pulling out any money you have in check/savings accounts and putting the cash in a safe deposit box to keep them from getting your money.

Failure to do so would be in direct violation of the law.  It could be that they do not have the paperwork to show validation of the debt.  Do not miss the court date because I believe that would be an automatic judgment against you.  Did you keep info of who you talked with, date, and what was said?   The legal dept seems not to have their paperwork in order if they cannot validate the charges.  Explain to the judge of their refusal to give you validation.
