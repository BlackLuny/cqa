20080708133633AAvJlTH	Beauty & Style;Hair	When i go outside my thin hair waves?	I used to live up north and it was dry there. My hair was so perfect! First of all, it's very shiny and soft. After I wash it, it's wavy and not frizzy. When I straightened it, it became so gorgeous. Even when I went outside for hours it would stay really nice.   Then I moved to south Texas.   It SUCKS!   It's incredibly humid here.   My hair became the biggest disaster. It started to frizz. I tried a million of products for it. I have a very expensive straightner, but just when I go outside, my hair becomes a mess. It starts flipping and frizzing. Also in Texas my hair started looking even thinner.    I tried so many things for it, but nothing works.   I know that his happened because of the weather, but I can't live with hair like that. I have to constantly put it up because it starts getting waves in it after I go outside.    Please tell me what should I do.   Maybe I should cut it? Or what products should I use for it to be straight?

My friend asked me to post this  (:   she is east indian, and is very "white" compared to the rest of her family, sometimes i don't even consider her brown because her skin is like the same colour as mine.    she has thick black hair and it goes down to the middle of her back.    she also has really dark brown eyes, they're almost black looking.       she wanted to know what kind of makeup she should use to enhance her features. ( i already think she's gorgeous but she doesn't believe me)    so any tips on eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow and powder would be greatly appreciated.       she says thanks (:    *if any additional information is required. please say so (:

20081028093726AA2TOMC	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Tattoo not as expected. ?	I didn't make any of the mistakes mentioned previously. I went to a good tattoo studio. Found the best artist there, and looked at his portfolio all of was colorful well drawn free hand work that was simply amazing. Wanted a custom and found the picture I wanted on google of Gir the small robot from the show Invader Zim. His essence is very similar to mine and as I suffer bipolar I tend to ward off depression by mimicking his careful youthful spirit. This is the picture that I said was exactly what I wanted with a slight adjustment to make it look like he was swinging his legs (indicated by minor outside shading).     http://api.ning.com/files/BAocqe6i-EIwKM...       This is what I got.     http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...        The extensive shading is too dark and distracting to the point that the basic design and simplicity is lost. Is there any way to redo the shading? I'm assuming a cover-up will not work as it is so dark. I would like shading but I wanted it to be more like the tatt below. Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.        http://farm1.static.flickr.com/50/130788...

20081104203437AAMrFcb	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Ear Piercing Question. ?	Heyy there;    well.       I got my ear pierced when I was 9, and the gun got stuck in my ear and had to take apart the gun to get it out of my ear, and than it was painfully infected.  in gr. 6 I got it re done , cause I only had one ear pierced.. but for the first day of school it was 3 weeks later having the piercing and i wore hoops, fell asleep in hoops that night and woke up and the hoop fell out of my ear and it was closed.      and recently I am now 17. and on september 18th, I got it re done... it is now Nov. 4th and last week I wore hoops for my first time... it THROBBED and I had forcefully put a stud back in.. I cleaned every earring i put in my ear and I have been cleaning it regularly. its not red, pussing or any of that jazz its just VERY sore, let me know what I can do, to make it better.. I figure it might take longer to heal since im piercing through scar tissue.

I think we're badly in need of some positivity on these boards!

(and he is attracted to me... his friends told me..though we've never spoken before he alllways stares) is going to be at this party tomorrow I'm goinggg to and I think if all goes well we will kiss :)   What would be a good kiss for at a party... there will probably be drink but I'm really careful not to drink so I can't control my self and these types of parties don't usually get out of hand too much.    Any tips on how to kiss him??? I'm assumingg cause he's popular , hot and 17 he will be experienced....   Would it be okay if I licked then parted my lips really slightly and softly slid them over his a couple of times...... then is it okay to kind of subtly tickkle his lips / tip of his toungue with mine while kissing???? THen next is it okay if i part my lips a little further, and then we just massage toungues until this kiss ends??   How does that sound????? Will he know I haven't done it before?! Any more tips??

20090227174235AAAe4VB	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Extremely Sensitive Skin? Skincare Products? Help?	Ok, so I've found out recently that I have really sensitive skin. My skin used to be pretty clear, I'd occasionally get a pimple, and those were usually on the side of my face. Then in December I started getting more pimples, and my skin hasn't been clear since. I got the Clinique 3 Step skincare thing that has the bar of soup, the toner, and the moisturizer in like mid-January, I think. I have combination skin, so I got it for that.     Last week I got a horrible breakout. But I had stopped using the Clinique like a week before. My skin looked really good after using the Clinique, but I'd gotten some pimples, so I stopped.      My breakout started on my forehead and around my mouth, then it spread to the sides of my face. That's pretty much gone, but it's spread to my nose and upper lip.      The only thing I used to do to my skin was wash it with a wash cloth with water. Anytime I'd use any product, I'd get pimples, so I stuck to my simple routine of just water. But, I need help getting rid of this horrible breakout, plus I need some sort of moisturizer because my face is really dry(plus oily, but I can live with that). Maybe, something natural? I'm thinking it's the chemicals in the stuff I use.     So if you can suggest ANYTHING for me, I'd be grateful. Thanks so much!

20090225105328AAiZ21x	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Does anyone know how to use hard wax?	My friend who does eyebrows used hard wax on my hubby and I a few weeks ago. During that time she taught us how to use it.   So, my husband and I decided to buy hard wax (a different brand than hers) and warmer to do it ourselves since she taught us.   Well, I followed all the directions for ours, and it always stays somewhat gooey. I thought I had it on too thick and it wasn't drying thoroughly..... but when I put it on super thin its still gooey.       Directions state that you put the wax pot in the warmer for 35 minutes and then shut the warmer off. That is when to use it so it is thick and goopy- not runny. Then you apply a thin layer of wax to the area and let dry 5 to 10 minutes. It will be hard to touch and you can pull it off.      I am so frustrated. I have to keep getting oil out and rubbing the wax off because it's not working as the directions say. What am I doing wrong or is it the brand and/or type of wax?      I'm using GiGi Hard Wax with Floral Passions and the solo GiGi Wax Warmer

I'm only fifteen, almost sixteen. Is this normal? I have naturally wavy/curly hair, and I hate it- it doesn't look right when it's not thick. My waves aren't naturally full and dramatic anymore. =\      Thank You,   Lindsay

20090225104237AAYwc8z	Beauty & Style;Hair	What should I expect?	I had my hair permed by an old friend (back in middle school, 10+ years) back in December. She told me at first she didn't like perms, but that she found one that would work for me. In the middle of her perming my hair she tells me that in beauty school she missed most of the perming portion! (umm eeek!) Well I have long hair, with the perm its to the middle of my back. At first I wasn't happy with it and figured it just had to settle and I would have to learn to style it. I took my son to her about a month later and it was the first time she'd seen my hair since.....she didn't say ONE word about it.    I finally realized I was not happy with it. Some of my hair is permed how I want it but then rest looks like clumps of kinky hair. It's prob not as bad as you are picturing it, it's just not what I wanted. I told her I wanted big loose curls and that's not what I got. It's to the point where half the time I straighten it. I sent her an email expressing my concern and she said she wasn't happy with it. She scheduled me for an appt. today to give it a good trim and a deep conditioning and work on some styles with me. Should I expect it be done for free? Or for a discount at least? Is this something that can be fixed? lol
