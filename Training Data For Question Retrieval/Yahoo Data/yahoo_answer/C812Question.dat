20090225101212AAtnxw0	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	How is glucuronolactone addictive?	I've been trying this powdered drink called Totally 2Go Energy Rush, and I ran out.  I have no money to get more, and like clockwork, I got a headache around 5pm.  So, I make a cup of black tea, and then I puke it up 5 minutes after drinking it.      I never got this from caffeine alone.  The strange ingredient I find is glucuronolactone.  I rarely find this in other energy drinks (minus Red Bull, and I don't drink that stuff).  I've looked on Google, and all I can't seem to find any reports on withdrawal from this supplement.      Anybody have any sources on the addictive nature of glucuronolactone?  Any personal experiences?

20090227160155AAfN2oP	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Dagnabbit - how friggin' hard is it to get this order right the FIRST time?!?	Okay... stopped at McD's for a grilled chicken sandwhich on a regular hamburger bun with pickle, tomato, lettuce, onion and mayo.  No fries as they never seem to know how to serve them HOT.  What I got was NOT what I ordered and so I asked them to please correct my order.        What I got in turn was a deep fried chicken sandwhich on some soggy specialty bun with a huge gob of mayonaise, brown lettuce, no tomato, no onion, no pickle and barely warm.      The cashier got irritated that I was monopolizing her time and had said, "I ain't got time for this crap.  I'm almost off for the night."  With that, she pawned me off to someone else who was just as unhelpful as the one who'd pawned me off in the first place.  The order came back the same but this time sans lettuce.  WTF.  I mean... I can be patient but the same mistake in less than 8 minutes.  Hello, I have a problem with the customer service part.      I asked for a manager as I lack patience with people who are deliberately ignorant.  I left without the sandwhich as I don't believe in that 3 times a charm crap... get it right the first time and there won't be any griping from me.  The manager did NOT see things from my point of view so I asked for a refund which I was given reluctantly... and took my business elsewhere.  I paid for a product and I expected to receive what I'd paid for.  Is that really too much to ask or expect?        I know the answer to this... just fishing for opinions on how someone else might've handled it.

Default  Lagasse replaces pan woman used to fend off attack   Lagasse replaces pan woman used to fend off attack      1 hour ago      ELYRIA, Ohio (AP) — Chef Emeril Lagasse says he felt so bad when he heard a woman lost one of his trademark pans while warding off home intruders that he's replacing the item.      Lagasse (leh-GAH'-see) is sending 70-year-old Ellen Basinski a whole new set of his signature cookware.      She used her favorite pan to fight the intruders at her home west of Cleveland on Tuesday. Police then took it from her to be used as evidence.      Basinski was on the phone with her husband when the teens pushed their way into her home.      Her husband, Lorain County Judge David Basinski, overheard the scuffle, called 911 and raced home. Meanwhile, his wife says she grabbed the 5-quart saucepan and hit one teen, who was going through her purse.      The four were arrested. The judge said his wife was upset that her pan was seized by police.      Information from: The Plain Dealer,  http://www.cleveland.com       Source: Assoc. Press via Google News   __________________
