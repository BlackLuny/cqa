FkXt4XLvaa	Just using a hair product won't always help it in the long run. Using a shampoo specified to help your hair grow longer may initially do so but a lot of people - myself included - end up with drier hair that breaks easily and doesn't really work as long, beautiful hair so be careful when choosing them and keep a watch on your hair over the length of its use. If your hair does not do what the label says it will by the time the first bottle is gone, it isn't worth buying another bottle.<br>  <br>  As the first poster said, trimming the split ends every few months will help as well. The longer you keep split ends, the more the rest of your hair will follow in suit and you may end up going to a stylist and hear her say you've got eight or nine inches of split ends.<br>  <br>  DON'T take prenatal pills if you don't need to. They are not for people who are not pregnant and can create too much of a fluctuation in your body's natural ability to create vitamins and minerals, can actually make you sick and give you diarrhea which will flush the system and make you pale and weak and cause damage to your hair.<br>  <br>  But you do need to work from the inside as well. Protein is good for hair, whether it's applied through shampoos and conditioners or eaten. If you are not already doing so, start eating more lean chickens and turkeys. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, find a protein shake or supplement that best suits your needs.<br>  <br>  If you just deal with the surface of the hair, eventually the products you use are going to stop working and you will find that it will take much longer to get your hair back into health if that happens. And by focusing on beauty from the inside out, you may find that you don't have to rely on specific products.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try and include a few of these food in your diet to make your hair grow fast. Essential fatty acids are found in oily fish such as salmon and tuna, flaxseed oil, sunflower oil, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds. Mushrooms and cauliflower for Vitamin B.

Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|nRVUwocJaa	cut it every other month about a quarter inch to get the dead ends off and just let wait and let it grow.|`|aGmTf52gaa	howtogrowhairfast.com is your solution.|`|i5hgzPPwaa	Keep your hair oiled drink plenty of water and wash it every two or one week if African American

This is a process that separates you from your parents- but forces you to mold to the "norms" of your society.<br>  <br>  But you live in a fake society that is populated with people your own age- nature did not intend you to be shut in with your peers for long hours each day.<br>  <br>  The "norms" of society that really should be that as society as a whole.. is really just a small cross section of it.<br>  <br>  You are locked in with people JUST as mentally wired as you to be concerned about conformity.<br>  <br>  Ok- but you have to live in it.<br>  <br>  Ok- you can't afford cool clothes..<br>  <br>  Options:<br>  Babysit/ lawn mow- buy your own clothes<br>  <br>  You can take a cheap t-shirt and decorate it.

The only reason they are making fun of you is because they are not mature whatsoever. Just because your close aren't like everybody else's doesn't mean everything.

Your parents taught you the right thing.|`|8qx66ivpaa	just be yourself . dont change for anyone..  when time comes you will know when it right to be you and you will be successful in life.|`|ZrJ3sA0Haa	yeah.<br>  people are really immature.<br>  dont listen to them. you really should appreciate what you have.|`|2T49GGLKaa	dork? is that the best they could come up with? haha what losers! if that's the best insult they could come up with, then u shouldn't feel bad.<br>  <br>  seriousley, though, yes, there are some people shallow enough to judge people about how others dress. i know this. because i'm 13 too and i have been teased about my clothing by my best friend (pretty pathetic, right?). my family can't afford to take me shopping all the. i find one of the best techniques is too laugh in the face of the person teasing you. not a big loud laugh, just a small giggle and a look in their direction, like, "omg is that the best you can do?". trust me, i'm and expert at ticking people off.<br>  <br>  on a completley different note, i've heard that marshalls has AMAZING prices on clothing.|`|J6Tdrd8Xaa	Teenagers specifically judge others by what they wear, when you're older that lessens greatly, you seem to have a good attitude, brush off their criticisms like water off a duck's back.<br>  <br>  Fashion in itself is many things, I'm from the UK where fashion is more about finding your own unique style, in the US it's more about following others (sorry but if I've read one Hollister question I've read 100). Two people wearing a similar outfit or an outfit matched perfectly would get laughed at where I'm from in London. It's important to wear what makes you comfortable, if you're just not that into fashion then so what?, there are more important things to worry about.|`|R5pBAyMMaa	People are afraid to be different, and i know what you mean. People at my school wear ambercrombie, hollister, things like that. I'm happy with my style, i don't see the point of spending 50$ on a sweatshirt with one word on it. Be happy for who you are. It's hard not to feel hurt when people make fun of you, but like you said try the best you can. Act like you don't care. People who act like that are only insecure about themselves and are terrified about what people think about them.<br>  Hope i helped with the advice and good luck.|`|WpPeydNaaa	okay, first of all some people are just total jerks!<br>  do NOT let them bring you donw okay?<br>  they just have low self-esteem and need to pick on others to make themselves feel good<br>  it doesnt matter what the h*ll you wear so next time just think what a bunch of selfish losers<br>  they need to get a life<br>  and i wear clothes from like belk and stuff but i also buy clothes from those popular stores<br>  and i wear stuff from belk or something and people never know! and some people even like it<br>  i mean what does clothing have to do with ANYTHING??<br>  i mean c'monn<br>  go tell those jerks to get a  life<br>  and drop it(:|`|kopnlinUaa	Sadly, most girls our age (13) think it's cool to wear the same thing as most other girls. (usually this is stuff from Aeropostale, Hollister, or Abercrombie and Fitch). And yeah, most girls our age do judge others on what they wear. That's just stupid though. You should ask them why they care what you wear. I did that to a group of girls who were making fun of my clothes and they just stood there trying to think of a good reason why. No one can tell you what you have to wear, and anyone that tries has problems.<br>  <br>  Me, I hate wearing those kinds of clothes (tight, usually low cut.). These clothes are considered "fashionable", but that doesn't mean you have to wear them. If you don't like that kind of stuff, don't wear it. Although, some stores that have a lot of that kind of stuff might have some good clothes too. For example, I found a really nice jacket in American Eagle, even though I don't like most of the stuff there.<br>  <br>  Yeah, most girls our age do judge others on what they wear. That's just stupid though. You should ask them why they care what you wear. I did that to a group of girls who were making fun of my clothes and they just stood there trying to think of a good reason why. No one can tell you what you have to wear, and anyone that tries has problems. Wear what you like, and if anyone laughs at your clothes, laugh to yourself and be glad you don't have the same clothes as half the girls in school.|`|NYDynUfVaa	hey, im 13 too and yes sometimes people do care about what other people wear. I cant really relate to you becuase i wear Hollister,American Eagle, and Abercrombie and Fitch. But are they making fun of your clothes for not being expensive or ugly? if ugly then maybe try wearing cheap cool clothes from gap or something.|`|qWV8k308aa	every single person has their own specific style weather that style is conforming to wat other wear or wearing what u want. im a guy and i wear skinny jeans. i get made of for them. yet becasue i like how htey fit and they are comfortable so i keep wearing them so your style can be wat others like or what u like|`|EQIkP1siaa	Ummm well don't care what they say because they are JUST BULLYS so don't do anything a let them get them get in trouble themselves and my teacher was talking about it today|`|ibBEwMXbaa	Dont worry I have been through it many times.<br>  Try ignoring them.|`|Ky3XC0eVaa	I think its really mean that these kids were making fun of you, but take a look at your outfit. What were you wearing? Usually, if people don't know where your clothes came from they wont diss them if they look good. But if people know your outfit came from WalMart, thats not the best outfit in your closet. Were these kids making fun of you because of what your outfit looked like, where you got it, or how much it cost? <br>  My advice to you is to keep with your personal style, but try shopping at places where you can find a unique but cheap outfit. This might sound unappealing, and worse, but shop at thrift stores. These stores are dirt cheap, and if you have patience and look around there a lot you can find clothes that are vintage, or look exspensive, and no one else will have them or know where you got them, or how much you paid. People always make comments on how cute my clothes are, and most of my clothes are hand me downs from my family or from thrift shops.<br>  <br>  As for those kids making fun of your clothes, don't let it get you down too much. it is just your clothes, some kids make fun of for things they can't change like the way their body looks. You can totally flip your wardrobe around if you have enough determination. good luck|`|KyHYOKmQaa	When you get older you'll realize that in this kind of situation, it's THEM who are making fools of themselves by being immature. People tried to tell me this when I was your age and I didn't believe them for a second. But here I am, 22, and it's true! It doesn't matter if the entire school would laugh at your clothes, it's you who should laugh at them because they are being pathetic. The world is larger than the school world, and the culture in your school does NOT represent the world, at all. Not even your country, not even your city. I PROMISE you that.<br>  <br>  Dress however you like and don't listen to them. When you look back on this later in life you will be really proud over yourself that you stood your ground. Good Luck hun :)!|`|VgZ20wMlaa	Fashion:<br>  Make a statement!<br>  Wear what you want though...<br>  <br>  Be a trendsetter and wear what you like at the prices you like!

Just know your stores and brands.<br>  <br>  Some are: Pac Sun, Macys,Tj Maxx (It's actually really nice)<br>  <br>  And really... ignore those kids though.... u gotta love yourself before other people love you!<br>  <br>  you are who you are and if they dont like you just because of your clothes... then screw them!<br>  <br>  Those people arent worth it.... dont fit in. stand out.... <br>  <br>  stand out and be proud of yourself =)))|`|pyq6GF4taa	Im 13 also and I get made fun of at my school just because of my bohemian, laid back clothes. It totally sucks that people make fun of you. People shouldn't be made fun of just because they are different. Sadly-many people judge others on their looks and talk badly about them to feel better about themselves. To answer your question-Fashion is a term commonly used to describe a style of clothing worn by most of people of a country. A fashion usually remains popular for about 1-3 years and then is replaced by yet another fashion. A clothing style may be introduced as a fashion, but its use becomes a custom after being handed down from generation to generation. A fashion that comes and goes is called a Fad. During the mid-1800's, a mass production of clothing was made fashionable and available to more people for lower prices. This encouraged more people to wear more stylish clothes which is why we are wearing what we are today.<br>  I hope this info. helped!|`|sRBJWJXpaa	Wow. I know what you're going through, I really do, and I know it sucks. But the good news is, you don't have to pay a lot of money to look nice. You can try shopping at stores that have sales (which right now is EVERYWHERE). Old Navy has some cute stuff, but I still love department stores. See what colors you like and what you think looks good on you. Don't ever buy something only because everyone else is wearing it.<br>  Most importantly, please don't let their comments get to you. Not everyone can afford expensive clothes, and more often than not, those expensive stores (e.g. Abercrombie) are about the same quality you'll get at Sears.|`|xelv7U4Waa	um wow your 13 and you havent figured this out yet?<br>  <br>  *no offense*<br>  <br>  yes. your a teenage girl in this society. sorry hun, but YOU WILL BE JUDGED ON YOUR CLOTHES.<br>  <br>  well unless you hang out with loserrssss... *no offense again*<br>  <br>  yea. and you dont have to spend alot of money to dress cute!<br>  <br>  go to target, old navy, marshalls, aeropostale, forever 21, H&M or other stores like that.<br>  <br>  you can get superr cute stuff for like nothingg. <br>  <br>  price doesnt matter as much as cuteness and personal style.<br>  <br>  you can make walmart clothes look absolutely adorable if you have style.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  <br>  peace.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|yKoeZP9Saa	sure, ppl will judge you on your appearance first. I catch myself doing that sometimes. But that doesn't mean you have to buy expensive cloths. I'm thinking your just having problems finding your own style. try shopping at multiple places like aeropastel, Old Navy, or even Walmart. Their cloths are cheaper compared to Hollister and stuff like that. Then mix and match things to make them work. Bring a friend that you know that has good taste in cloths or bring a guy friend that would be honest with you.
HOdblqIkaa	i have one. i think its a little high to be considered a tramp stamp, its not visible if my shirt rides up or anything. i didnt put it there because of what other people were doing, i put it there because that was the best area (it was  large enough for what i wanted) im not really a fan of the term but its so old that it doesnt offend me. i wouldnt consider myself a tramp because of a tattoo location.|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	I do. It's a sexy part of the female body, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I didn't do it because everyone else did, I get tattoos and piercings for my own personal benefit.

VgZ20wMlaa	depends on your age... if you're in high school and if you're willing to change into diff outfits/style then maybe try the high fashion look?<br>  <br>  wear leggings and heels to school, maybe jumpers or a bubble skirt with medallion top?<br>  <br>  look in magazines for sure.<br>  <br>  But you shouldnt dress as someone else just to get a guy!People should like you for who you are. But change is sometimes good so =P...<br>  <br>  Try wearing skinny jeans? depending on what type of person you are... if you're athletic just wear sweats/tennis shoes like you are now.... dress to fit in or stand out! and keep in mind... even if you are a certain type of person.. you can wear anythnig you want.... =PPPP<br>  <br>  and remember.... this spring is all about splashes of color and print designs (mostly floral prints).

Cartilage piercings are the more painful piercing, but not by very much so you have nothing to worry about as the monroe location is thin. Everyone takes pain differently though. You'll have to find out for yourself.

It's not that I'm ashamed (that's the absolutely last thing I feel) - but I've always had an image of how I'd like to look on my wedding day, pure and perfect (for literally one day of my life!). Although my tattoos are totally a part of me and my body, I don't know I can't explain it, I just wouldn't want them on show that one day. That being said, I've never personally liked really showy wedding dresses anyway, you know the typical strapless or spaghetti strapped style, I've always loved the classic long sleeved look. I would consider having a low back and showing the tattoos on my back, but I just wouldn't want my arm tattoos to show on that occasion. I would, however, buy an amazing black strapless number and show all with pride at the reception! :-)<br>  <br>  (I'll also just add that this doesn't mean I don't think a bride can look beautiful with tattoos on show! My friend recently married with a tribal half sleeve fully on show - and I hate tribal - but I still think she looked absolutely radiant and the tattoo seemed to work totally!

I asked a guy what his prefrence was.  He licked his finger tips, and made a poppin sound with his mouth, slappin the air.  I know that sounds hella wierd.  But ever since then.

81k0tYhMaa	Yeah, you can get a tattoo if you are a cop. I've seen a lot of cops with them, but do you really want to be a cop? Most cops I have come across have been douchebags...I would say 99% of them. Hopefully you are pursuing detective work or something that has a real affect upon society. Not the typical beat cops who harrass and annoy the general public. <br>  <br>  Also, tattoos aren't gross and plenty of educated people have them. I have a college degree and a very good job and I have my back done, with additional tattoos on my legs and arms.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	I think as long as you get one where it's not visual by the public then who should care.|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	I'm almost positive that you can have them.

haNSPFR5aa	I had it for a while and it broke its supose to be waterproof but after a while it won't. The wave doesn't clean ur face 10x deeper as it claims to. It barely even cleanses it but does leave your skin softer. If you really want to keep using this rip off product you can buy more at target, walmart ect.|`|dv8267AAaa	No, I haven't heard much of it. I'm actually second questioning a neutrogena lotion I purchased. My skin has only gotten worst ( not improvements) since using neutrogena products. I think I will no longer purchase their products, unless I get results I want from current lotion. So far I can say that neutrogena has really messed up my skin. At this point, I wouldn't reccomand the products to anyone ( or at least one with similar skin problems as mines).

pA2NuFhUaa	This sounds a lot like a common genetic condition that I actually have myself. It's called Keratosis Pilaris. Mine are located on my upper arms from the elbow to shoulder (typically on the back of the arm). The bumps occur when excess keratin found in skin cells clog hair follicles which leads to the hard plugs on the skin. Keratin is also found in excess amounts on your palms, soles of your feet, and other rough surfaces so it makes sense as to why the bumps would be hard or rough. There is no cure but creams and peels are available if used on a regular basis. I have found that nothing really works but I don't mind. They are typically darker in the winter when I wear long sleeves and lighter in the summer when I wear shorter sleeves. You can find out if you really have KP by visiting a dermatologist. They can diagnose you after a visual examination. :) Hope this helps.|`|oyjP2mZBaa	HOLY CRAP I HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM!<br>  Are they red?<br>  and are they allll over?<br>  Do they look like goose bumps?<br>  Sorry for not answering your question.|`|S1e4N8Z1aa	Honestly I would talk to your doctor maybe they can give you a cream to get rid of it.
qxrr69bnaa	A dermatologist will tell you there is no such thing as a "safe" tan.  Once a week for 12 minutes is my time in the tanning bed.

j3g5UapGaa	yes im a lot like her and i tend to be shy and insecure when im by myself. If i see the guy i like in the hall i might also go the other way because i strat thinking if i should say somehting or if it will be akward and if i will look like an idiot if i just walk and dont say anything. A lot goes through my mind in those few seconds hha ahha so she migh be doing the same thing. Try talking to her and making sure she feels comfortabble. I would love that and if shes anything like me she will too. Sorry for all this writing ahha i just relate to this a lot lmfao sorry :)|`|X9BTQQYmaa	It's called playing hard to get. Girls do it when they really like a guy, so they think "Why does she ignore me ?" and post questions on the internet for advice. :)<br>  So she obviously likes you [or at least thinks you're cute] so talk to her! <br>  Good luck! <3|`|iYM7Jacyaa	sometimes i do that if i like them alot. i try not to do that because then the guy will catch on but it just happens. if she is an outgoing person and she is only shy around you then she probably likes you.|`|gw7GoKAraa	Yeah but then spot him alone and then talk.

Yc6eUIW9aa	It's bad for your hair if you TWIST it up in the towel.<br>  ..|`|nsC9u8qHaa	Of course not :)<br>  I do it all the time.|`|chfILbonaa	No, I do it all the time and my hair is fine.|`|fmdoGQizaa	No, it's actually better for you than anything else.<br>  When your hair is wet it becomes very weak, therefore brushing it and blow drying it actually does a lot of damage to it. Brushing it when wet makes hairs break and fall out. And the heat of a blow dryer does damage too. So it's best to put it in a towel for 5-10 minutes, and THEN blow dry it. That way your hair is healthy. Also, just a little tip: Don't wash your hair with hot water as this damages it.

B1960Lxwaa	try using shampoo that hydrates or repairs because when you straigten your hair it removes moisture and makes it frizzy. if you want a different hair style other than straight try this. after you take a shower towel dry it and but into a bun. let it air dry or if you take showers at night just sleep with it in a bun after shower. it should be curly when its dry and you take it down.  if you still want to straighten it use heat protection, like a spray. you can find it at most beauty supply stores. hope i helped! :)

Try getting a a soft colored jacket/sweater/sweatshirt thats fleece, like a light blue, light pink, pale yellow, or pale green. I personally think that fleece looks best in solid colors, so skip the patterns or designs. Add a black, brown or gray scarf and do you hair in a poof, braids, or curl or straighten it. Wear blue or black skinny jeans, and flats. <br>  <br>  THAT WOULD LOOK QUITE STYLISH!<br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|tGGVeW3yaa	Who cares what your friend thinks, wear what ever the hell you like, life's to short to care whats stylish and whats not,|`|z3qhTbphaa	i luv fleece<br>  all my winter jackets have fleece on it and it's really comfortable<br>  i think all fleece jackets gives u a kind of laid back look
z03u3JGXaa	You should wait at least 10 days from the time you colored - You risk scalp irritation and color fading or going off-tone or hair breakage or all of the above. Make sure your Hair & Scalp are in good condition before proceeding. Get some deep conditioning treatments but don't use them until the color has set for 48 Hrs. (2 Days)|`|C1DsQsWlaa	There are some relaxers that you can use the dye as well, I would wait a while. For the mean time, purchase a Straightening comb and press out the roots b/c a lot of people get relaxers before they actually need one. I know tis old school, but it works. By the summer, you hair would have grown out a lot. This is good for the winter and fall because, in the spring and summer, you sweat a lot more and you also sweat your hair out. My hair is extremely damaged and this is what i'm doing.|`|g9F2vIi0aa	if you mean a toner for blonde hair only about 5 minutes.. i put mine in for 20 and it went sort of grey... it washes out but i think 5 minutes would do it...<br>  <br>  member thought that it takes about a week for the colour to settle properly and for you to grow to like it...|`|z8VRBWPDaa	2 weeks
BTI0XOptaa	Head lice only transfer through physical contact, they do not jump or fly as is commonly believed. So unless you touch heads or share clothing the chances of you getting lice are pretty slim. <br>  <br>  Check close to the scalp (as this is where they live) and make sure you see either live eggs or lice before you treat yourself. You don't need to worry too much. If you haven't got an infestation, don't go treating yourself with pesticide treatments. Not only is this an overwhelmingly drastic measure, chemical head lice treatments are not meant to work in this way.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following sites for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|L0oLpDwSaa	ohh i learned about this in science. <br>  when you get lice, you see these little white things witch are really lice eggs.<br>  and i no everyones hair gets itchy once and a while but when you get lice you REALLY start to itch like with both hands. <br>  if this girl really wants to make sure she has lice or not, go to someone who knows how to check if someone has lice.<br>  but theres really nothing to worry about. theres tons of like cream and shampoo that you can use that'll make it go away.<br>  <br>  well good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S : if this girl has any brothers,sisters,family members that may use her stuff (etc) then make sure they dont use her comb or anything that she may use or put in her hair. or else they will get lice too and thats not verry good :P|`|fpGqmFKvaa	you can tell if someone has lice because they are always scratching their hair, to get rid of them you get this treatment stuff which you can get in like a chemist or something, and you also need a special comb

85gJHDbNaa	I'm wondering the same thing. I'm always falling out of my bikini top (and not in the "nice" way), and I've heard under wire bathing suits are much better. Perhaps you could get one with a very summery/swimsuit like design? Like one with a blue wavy design rather than a frilly design or plain black top, because people would better associate it with a swimsuit rather than underwear. Do you sort of understand what I'm saying?|`|dy9ejsbfaa	Victoria's Secret has swimming suits that have support. I thought most of them looked super sexy!|`|lAV4rgonaa	yeah i definitely think they look a little too much like a bra. =/|`|N0cmhQYJaa	i saw someone with one once. yeah they have them that look just like a bra. when i first saw it i was like that looks kinda weird but then i really liked it i dno the ones from victoria secret are really cute and the more support you have would look better too so you wouldnt be self conscious that youd pop out of something haha|`|TfmvWPLLaa	theyre nice and supportive. i look way better in them than i do normal tops. its probably bcuz i have a big belly and tiny boobs, so the flimsy string bikinis emphasize it. we seem to consider underwire bikinis for opposite reasons lol. well i hope u find something that works for you:)

But I could differentiate that the hot topic model has more layers in her hair and is slightly longer.|`|9CYpX1J8aa	the first taylor pic looked the best i got myhair cut today just past my shoulders lol my head is so light now!!  be sure 2  condition it heaps|`|jU0dGPzUaa	The second one. (:|`|GIkyDUulaa	taylor momsens cut is great.  do that one<br>  <br>  the other two dont look as mature|`|8tLS1XDWaa	I like the second one, but I love the bangs in the first one, so why dony we keep the length of the second one and do a razor finish to add body and a litle flair.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	You wouldn't be charged as much as you would be charged if you went and had them done on seperate days, if this is what you mean. They tend to have a standard price for things around this size, and you'd be charged that twice if you had them done on seperate days but if you had them done on the same day it would be cheaper for you. For example a 4x2 tattoo wouldn't cost exactly double what a 2x1 tattoo would, and just because they're seperated on your body, it will still count as part of the same job. A couple of weeks ago I had two quite detailed pieces each about the size of a palm, one on each arm, and they were totally unrelated tattoos, but even then I saved myself a lot of money by getting them on the same day - it cost me ￡80 to get them done all in one go whereas it would have cost me about ￡140 if I'd had them done on seperate days.|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	Dear baby young blood.

1mfvjIupaa	It depends how much you do to your hair. Split ends DOES make your hair grow a lot slower, and chemicals [ like hair dye, perms, etc ] can slow it down too. Assuming you don't really curl or dye or straighten your hair much, it should have grown about one or two inches. It's kinda late now, but if you wanna speed things up I recommend Mane n Tail horse shampoo. Yeah, it sounds pretty weird but it works for me. The only problem was that it made my hair really thick, and I hate thick hair. If you don't like thick hair either, then you can go get it thinned out at your next haircut.|`|piE8mQM3aa	Hair normally grows half and inch a month (about)|`|PuRpsENEaa	Hair grows .5 inch a month. but I use mane'n'tail shampoo and conditoner, honestly, best thing I;ve ever gotten. my hair grows up to 2 inches every month. google it

4gkPFS8waa	1) Shampoo and condition your hair.<br>  2) Leave in a towel until hair is damp.<br>  3) Once damp, put texturizing paste in your hair<br>  4) Rub all around, giving your hair the messy look.<br>  5) Blow dry.

I used to do this to my hair often... John Frieda, sold at most drug stores, used to make some great ones although I'm not sure if they still carry them. A texturizing spray would work the best, and don't be afraid to use a little on the top of your hair. Just don't over-do it so as to avoid making your hair look super greasy. Apply whatever use while your hair is still damp, even wet, if you chose. Some gel might work too, just not that extreme hold crap that makes your hair feel like hay. I'd stick with some texturizer and a little mouse!|`|NfIdKeJ8aa	my hair used to do that, <br>  then i started using herbal essence frizz control. it's an orange bottle. i have thick hair and i never thought anything would work but it really does.<br>  <br>  also get your hair layered a bit. but only longer layers else it will have funny kinks. <br>  <br>  you can always try sea salt spray as well. but that depends.|`|ICel15qYaa	Blow dry it then curl it<br>  If u want small soft waves, use a straightening iron to curl<br>  For bigger waves use a curling iron<br>  And for full out waves use rollers<br>  If u want hairto be nateally wavy (this doesn't come out that wavy) u can put ur hair into a bun at nightandsleep in it|`|MToAgvtIaa	sunsilk waves of envy, the cream/gel one is reallly good<br>  thats waht i use

Women just end up feeling pressured to do it. I guess for some the pressure comes at an earlier age, like thirteen. For me it did... I was constantly teased and called ugly, and I started wearing make-up to make myself feel and look better. I think make-up is a bit of a confidence boost.|`|d3N60SuSaa	I know what you mean.

Q87xLOkdaa	Go for colour on your cheeks (blush) and in your eyeliner...I wear purple eyeliner from time to time and shade the rest of my lid with a gunmetal-grey colour.

1vaqtRI2aa	The short answer: Yes, they're required to sterilize all tools between clients. Not to mention it's completely disgusting not to. You don't know who's hair they've been cutting before hand. They could have lice or other bacteria chilling in their hair.<br>  <br>  Not EVERY client that comes in gets a shampoo/rinse. So not EVERY client will have clean hair.<br>  <br>  I'd try finding a different salon that you know sterlizes tools.<br>  <br>  And by the way, her attitude was pretty rude. She could have been nicer about it and explain in a more polite way. You're the client- I'd NEVER come out rude like to someone I was doing make-up on. <br>  <br>  Good luck in finding a new salon!|`|rsAqrbsgaa	"so i walked home with wet hair"<br>  <br>  haha|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	She is cutting clean hair....|`|Z4PxfObXaa	Every salon that I have been to has sterilized the tools as well.<br>  So, maybe this was just a ghetto, cheap, and dirty place.<br>  Just never go back.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	I think it's a reasonable request. Some customers come in there with lice and who knows what. Also there could be leftover chemicals that damage your hair from the previous customer.|`|5n6s0vUyaa	thats barbicide which kills most of it but i think really high end places they use some kind of light to kill off the bacteria or other stuff.|`|vMiX1lL7aa	but its just hair..|`|1f856832e9c2c82cf8e9c0a039004c54aa	They're not required to sterilize, but they are required to disinfect by either barbacide or UV light after each customer. It was a reasonable request and she must have not wanted your business that badly to just flat out say no and refuse to. I would've walked out also<br>  <br>  It really isn't that harmful if they don't disifnect but in my state they fine the stylist $500 for not doing so during an inspection.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Yes You have that right. I have never seen anyone sterilize their scissors. If cut my self or anyone else I do. I use cleaning spray on my clippers though not every time but you should. The Blue Barbacide jars are for combs.  Most don't even clean brushes every time but you should. If you asked yes I would clean my scissors they don't rust unless they are really cheap. Find a stylist that will do as you ask, it's not unreasonable & your comfort is important.|`|dbVNYa9Saa	i would of asked her 2 speak to the manager then tell the manager the situation then ask her if anyone else can help you i'm pretty sure the other hair dressers do clean their items, or i would of just told her 2 blow dry my hair b4 i walked out because wet hair could get u sick|`|dLlI92OWaa	Um, It's a bit ridiculous, isn't it, i mean its just your hair|`|aJZ4oGMKaa	they are cutting clean washed hair ! what is your problem really!!? some people are soo overly germophobic its ridiculous ! germs are all over YOU ever single day in case you never knew.|`|RbLw8izTaa	omg eew!<br>  WHAT THE H3LL!?<br>  am i the only one who thinks this is<br>  DISGUSTING!<br>  ugh how could they not sterilize, thats just wrong.|`|xMyidfFhaa	No, of course not. Hair dressers should ALWAYS sterilize tools (and hands as well) between clients. Although many patrons of salons do not have scalp diseases (but there's always a possibility) the hairdresser gets "close and personal" with another person's hair...and when He/She doesn't wash thair hands or sterilize thair tools, well, to put it simply, they're rubbing a stranger's dead cells into your scalp. Also, the "rusting of the scissors" excuse is, after all, just an excuse. The scissors should have been high quality enough to resist rust or they should not have been used on hair. A good hairstylist will cater to thair customer's requests best he/she can (with their best interests in mind), however idiosyncratic it may seem. And your particular condition is far from that.

Dab it across your face to help open pores.  <br>  <br>  Now, either apply a mask or wash your face with facewash.<br>  <br>  Afterward, use COLD water to wash the mask / facewash off.  This will close your pores, preventing dirt from penetrating them. (Less blackheads).|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	wash your Face With Cold Water|`|jJZNf1gTaa	Home remedy. Take sugar and honey (or syrup) and create a paste. Wet your face and start to scrub your face using the paste. After you rinse your face rinse with cold water to close your pores. Trust me, I learned this technique from my gay guy friend and it really works.
MehqmwZXaa	You have to wash your hair whenever your roots are dirty, just make sure you only apply shampoo to your roots and never to your ends. Use a mild shampoo. <br>  <br>  Always condition your mid-lengths and ends, specially since you have extensions. Do not apply conditioner to your roots or you will make your hair oily. Extensions can get pretty dry and brittle, because they don't get natural oils and you straighten them. <br>  <br>  Remember to avoid touching your hair as much as you can, that will make it get oily faster. <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped!

The shirt is cute and would work for a girl to so you should buy it. <br>  I would say the sizes are probably the same so get a medium, you can always return it by sending it back.
PSeocHeHaa	1. change your pad when it's full. if you have an average period, that's probably 1-3 times a day depending on how heavy your period is that day.<br>  2. no it should not hurt. if it hurts to put it in then you're doing it wrong.<br>  3. yes there are many different shapes and sizes of tampons. i too found even the regular size to be too big and hurt to take out. i found the smallest ones i could find. they are called playtex gentle glide slender light, but they only come in a combo pack of slender light and slender regular, which would probably be good for you because you have an average period.  i have a very light period so i only use the slender light ones.<br>  4. YES it is completely normal for it to be complicated to put a tampon in at first.  to be honest, i couldn't figure it out until i was 18!  some girls get the hang of it right away, some have trouble. it's normal either way.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	-change it whenever it looks or feels full to you<br>  -if you put it in wrong or not high enough it can hurt. if it does take it out and try another one, and make sure you put it all the way in.<br>  - they have all different kinds. regular, super, light, extra light, petite, probably more..if regular feels too big try light or petite ones, or maybe a different brand.<br>  - yes, its normal. i had troubles with it. i wouldnt put them high enoguh and they would hurt, i eventually had to ask my sister how it worked. and eventually i got the hang of it. <br>  <br>  -if you still need help maybe a female relative can  help you out, or a close friend. good luck|`|UuSmemr7aa	1. change your pad when it feels full...you'll feel it.<br>  2. no it shouldn't hurt, it doesn't really hurt<br>  3. yes, theres small, reg., large.<br>  4. yes it is i had trouble you have to stick it up far enough so it won't feel like a piece of poop up there(:<br>  <br>  hope i help !<br>  ohh, and when starting your period your going to stop for about 6 months then have it again !|`|c3d48b333e3b1797d8af8f39b48239e6aa	Tampons are horrible. There's that risk of disease. Pads should be changed when you feel its heavy or about every two-three hours. Keep those little wipes with you to feel "fresh".|`|1TiUZwoyaa	I can relate, I also don't have a mom and I'm 13 years old. It's really not that awkward once you get talking about it with your dad. If you still don't seem to get comfortable talking about it with your dad, find a trusted female like an aunt, nurse, friend's mom, or grandma.<br>  <br>  1. You should change your pad every 4-5 hours, or whenever it feels "full". <br>  2. Tampons will feel uncomfortable at first, once you practice a bit, it will become for natural feeling. But if you use tampons, remember to really push it up there. Something that helped me is that I found out your vagina is more horizontal than upwards, keep that in mind. When you have your tampon in, you shouldn't feel it at all. If you do, push it up a bit more!<br>  3. Yes! There are many different sizes! They even have one especially made for teens! The most commonly used sizes are regular, super, super plus, and ultra. It is good to use the tampon that fits your flow, regular for lighter flows, ultra for the most extreme, which I don't recommend. <br>  4. Again, yes! I had a LOT of trouble, it was terrible for me because I didn't really read the diagram that came with it. It's extremely normal to not get it the first few times, that's why a lot of girl start out using pads instead of tampons.<br>  <br>  Well, good luck! Hope you understand everything!|`|HvbIE03saa	1) You should change your pads whenever they are no longer effective (ie: if they're no longer absorbing the blood).<br>  <br>  2) A tampon can hurt to put in for some girls, and some generally can't use them at first.<br>  <br>  3) There are different sizes, and I believe that the regulars are the smallest...but I think there may even be a smaller size meant for girls first starting their period who have trouble with bigger ones. Check out the feminine hygeine products aisle at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  4) As I mentioned in #2, yes, it can be complicated for some girls the first times they try to use tampons. I know a lot of girls who weren't able to use them until after they had sex. If it hurts though, don't force it.<br>  <br>  Good luck...is there possibly an Aunt or trusted female teacher you might be able to talk to?|`|XqzH0l0Maa	oh wow. you need to connect with a female close to you. im sorry to hear about your mom. <br>  what i would say is dont worry about using tampons right now. its normal that they are complicated to use right now. use pads and change often. i would say every couple of hours if not sooner to change your pads. <br>  you must have someone to confide in and ask these type of questions. maybe your school nurse will help you out if you dont have anyone else.|`|famEeKtPaa	Hello you should change your pad every three to four hours or if a heavy bleeder sooner than that.I use tampons and it didn't hurt you can't tell that your using one but if you insert it roughly it will.|`|jX2GErqWaa	<a href="http://thisinall.makes.it" rel="nofollow">http://thisinall.makes.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|Njgof6hNaa	Well, my favored pad brand is Always. I always change it depending on how heavy my flow is. The first few days I change it every time I go to the bathroom. After that I change it when it looks or feels full. Eyeballing it on first glance pretty much tells you if you need a change.<br>  I did try tampons once, I believe it was Pearl something, anyhow, I didn't like the experience. I was left feeling very dry and it was uncomfortable and worried I'd spot through my panties. It was awkward. I didn't like it. Everyone is different. It's all a matter of preference. The good thing about tampons now is you can get a box that comes with different sizes for your whole period. Some are for a heavier flow and some for the lighter part of your period. And the one thing to remember about those is that you don't need to shove it high in, but just at the entrance of your vagina. That way you don't end up having to fish it out. That's just gross, but good advice. And if you do go the way of pads, always moisturize around the area, typically after you bathe/shower. It'll keep you smoother and will be a comfier experience for you. Also, whether you use pads or tampons, try to shower once a day. You'll feel fresher and wont have to worry about any odors. That's about it and remember to take some pain pills like ibuprofen/motrin on the day you start to feel twinges/cramps. It'll minimize any pain and you'll be good for the rest of your period. There's stuff specifically for cramps, but I didn't find much success with them. You might, dunno, but work with what works for you. I usually take 2 pills every 3-4 hrs, depending on the level of pain in my cramps. I do this the first day or as long as the pain persists. I'm usually good after that.

It's very generic and most Tattoo artists get offended by doing cliche things like butterflies and stuff, it insults their artistic ability.  If you've seen the idea done more than twice, avoid it, that is unless you are doing something like the lyric which can be altered in a million different ways...and each one is original...|`|sweQiOj9aa	why don't you get the classic white trash, prison tattoo that says "Born to Lose"  or maybe "Born to Ride"?  Or how about a skull and crossbones?  Or you could go with the all time favorite "Mom"  maybe with a little rose on each end.  How will the ladies maintain their composure??|`|fVca0uK2aa	get a treble clef/bass clef heart. its really cool. look it up. oh get a line from your favorite song tattooed but like with the notes only on the staff and everything. its a really cool idea...|`|6JzgBhRQaa	what inspired you to sing?<br>  uhmmm favorite song lyrics of all time?<br>  or something of that nature

I'm not telling you not to, but I'm not telling you to either. Your friend could wind up with a bunch of infections and other problems. Please go to a professional.|`|dyiuwz0qaa	You can go to walmart or places like that and there are peircing kits you can buy, that should do it =]|`|FkunZ9q4aa	Honestly, go to a professional.  Have your friend shell away a couple bucks each week and go get it done.  Professionals are trained to do this kind of stuff.  If you should mess up, your friend's gotta deal with that and so do you.<br>  <br>  Another idea is ask around for piercers who are training.  Usually they will do their work free or discounted because they need the experience.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Mmmm I suggest you don't do it.If she can't afford a proper piercing how can she afford everything she needs to if it gets badly infected.Tell her to make her own money doing something and then when she has enough, you'll go with her to get it pierced.I'm also pretty sure you don't want to be blamed for if something goes terribly wrong.I'm sure she's a good friend of yours...but yah never know I mean it is her nose thats at risk.|`|tWePoJYNaa	Just do A LOT of research. The septum is thicker, so there is probably a specific needle that is used. I think the best thing for you to do is go to a parlor and ask them for advice. They can show you the equipment they use and tell you how to do it best. I think that would be the safest thing to do. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Except, I really don't think you should do this. You could hurt her and it's not safe.|`|rkkyNwBqaa	try watching youtube videos first|`|yI8i0yZgaa	Make sure to use a sterile hollow needle, Don't use like, a safety pin or sewing needle or anything, other than that just let her know it's going to hurt, I've done all (6) of my own piercing, septum hurt, the rest didn't. xD. Just be careful, If you mess up the needle can damage the sinus.. =\. Best leave it to someone who knows what they are doing and has a state Lic.|`|AEXJcpmHaa	take a wire coat hanger, get it burning hot, close your eyes and shove it though her nose, then tie the hanger in a big bow and spray some bactine on it....idiot teenage piercers....please give us real body mod artists some credit and stop messing with our craft youll cause serious infection in attempting a septum|`|i9SsCOJ7aa	Get a good lawyer on retainer for when your friend sues you for permanently damaging her nose.  See?  I didn't tell you not to do it.|`|lh3WIZ1saa	lol. dont do it<br>  theres a reason why they are called professionals<br>  <br>  <br>  ... you just said u never did anyone septum before.<br>  and if you did yours so well then why are you asking for tips|`|af2e80262205de82271aa1bc92cd7775aa	your friend is going to trust your to pierce her septum when you are getting tips on yahoo q's that's a trusting friend|`|RGG30rbkaa	They are called professionals for a reason|`|1q0onMQtaa	Your friend is an idiot.|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Get yourself a long needle...it should be fine, what's the worst thing that could happen?|`|ZkjClLaKaa	its illegal to pierce other people without a piercing license.

l0JL8BUzaa	chi!!|`|K9HUiCUGaa	I have the croc, which you may have never heard of, yet i have had it for  almost two years and I like it a lot. It heats up VERY quickly. This I believe is fairly expensive, yet not as expensive as others. I believe the best overall, although expensive, is the chi brand. As for hair damaging, all straighteners will damage hair, but there are some sprays and creams you can put on before using heat tools.|`|dLlI92OWaa	chi is great. you should also try nova, it doen't damage your hair at all|`|t6azk5sUaa	Chi!|`|y8HRHAcIaa	I bought an ISO, at one of those stands at the mall, and I got it for 100 dollars, they will leave it to you for less, and they are real cool. They don't damage your hair and you can do a lot of things with it, from curls to straight. It has life warranty and if it breaks, they give you a new one!!|`|MLAT5ahpaa	either the CHI or the straighteners at www.isobeauty.com <br>  the chi works cool but it secretly has metal under the ceramic(shhh don't tell! jk) so its kinda bad. but the flat irons at iso beauty r like so koolio. it really depends on how much u wanna spend.|`|9najmVapaa	Your best bet is to buy a trustworthy GHD.<br>  <br>  Although they are a bit up-market, they last for years and will save you money for having to constantly purchase better ones.<br>  <br>  My GHD heats up in about 20 seconds, and I only have to put it to my hair once every 3 days and it is always straight and smooth.|`|ukcNjRA7aa	i had a 24 conair one from walmart. worked good i gave it to my sister she looves it. i got a really good one though now, but it cost 220  lol.|`|aIb7HdpMaa	its in between chi and wet2straight. wet2straight is awesome because you can straighten your hair soaked. well not legitimately(:|`|lV2TXXQyaa	Well cheap ones damage your hair.<br>  I have the Enzo Milano and it works great. Chi is also good.|`|Ns1NthGvaa	i have about 4 different chis and i love them   it cost alittle over $400.00 though but that was for all 4|`|w2si6gFMaa	i use chi and i LOVE it!!|`|CoACAmkRaa	Chi.|`|RbLw8izTaa	the best is the Chi ceramic plated.<br>  although it is expensive, i cant match it to anyhing else. it is such the best ive ever used and now im spoiled from it so every other ones seems like crap!
uC55n3HIaa	To become a fashion designer you would need to take many art/design/textile/sewing classes. These are the primary skills of a fashion designer. The average fashion designer makes around 50 grand a year. Of course if you're the top 10% your income is 100k+. You should also check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> It's a community for aspiring fashion designers to display their designs, get community feedback, and meet other designers.

I have a few friends who majored in fashion design.  You have to learn to sew, about textiles and fabrics, you have to learn art history as it pertains to your subject and have a background in art.|`|C0KejMfVaa	go to colleges like F.I.T in the city. take sewing and fashion classes. if your good, you get paid good money.|`|6Z49DZaRaa	<a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos291.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos291.htm</a><br>  <br>  This link can give you tons of information about qualifications, earnings, etc. Good luck!
FSQ1hkt2aa	You should probably invest in a special dandruff shampoo... Head and Shoulders, Selsum Blue, etc.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Clean the hair and scalp daily with Baby Shampoo. The Baby Shampoo cleanses the hair and scalp with its less harsh ingredients but removes the excess oil from the scalp and pores leaving the skin still infused with the conditioning oils. This also avoids you from having to use harsh conditioners that could also cause your scalp to react badly and flake off.

B1960Lxwaa	try mineral power by maybelline. thats what i use and i have combination skin, and mild acne. it works really good.|`|Pvp36CRyaa	try colorstay foundation by revlon. <br>  <br>  there are kinds for dry/normal skin<br>  and<br>  oily/combination skin.<br>  <br>  so you'll know the right choice for you.<br>  <br>  it gives you a matte finish for us oily girls and stays on all day :D<br>  <br>  i love it.|`|Q16vCXDaaa	Yeah, dream mousse works well. I have oily skin to so thats what I use. but if you don't wanna do alot of touch - ups all day you should get a cheap compact thats your skin color and just put a little bit over your face after you pu on the mousse :)
5e0755e06d5f4f1b24b497cc9427c910aa	By "replica" I assume you mean "counterfeit".  Which is illegal.  Which PayPal doesn't really allow.  So that's why they all want Western Union. They're criminals.
eN7qLfIkaa	Get your hair cut by a hairstylist in your area that has curley hair. She will know best. <br>  <br>  My hairstylist has curley hair (though i don't) and she does an awesome job, because she knows how curley hair works.
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Thank you for making the world smell better.  Damn their good commercials starring masses of hot turned on girls in their underwear.  Thats why that foul cheap smelling stuff flies off the shelves.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Yes, I hate the smell of them.<br>  Its way too strong.|`|CIlwfiU3aa	I do not like AXE at all...Tag is a bit better...<br>  <br>  I do agree the initial shock is a bit  much...but after they air out they smell better..|`|Qbczt3ivaa	I cant stand those things! why do guys have to use the whole thing in less than 1 day!? Then again, I prefer men, not teenage boys who overuse body spray....|`|nkjGVOQ2aa	rofl, that one axe or tag commercial with the chocolate guy scares me.|`|FQuuztpQaa	I'm a guy that like deodorants, Axe sucks. lol|`|6wGkycFAaa	I think these sprays, like all fragrances, are very different depending on who is wearing them. For me personally I prefer a stronger, richer and more expensive fragrance. I am also 39 years old. I have a son who is 13 and he always smells great. He uses sprays such as the ones you mentioned. It suits him and makes me happy that he cares enough to want to smell that good. I would find it unsuitable and too young for the man in my life. They really strike me as a youthful fragrance.|`|yI8i0yZgaa	They both test on animals, That alone makes them utterly disgusting.|`|miU0ogXiaa	My boyfriend wears Axe.  When he first puts it on it smells too strong but then after a few minutes it smells better|`|6ESUnzQjaa	AHAHA axe isss grrossss!!!!! hahah guys at my school try to be cool and where it. ( its not cool)|`|MSTluKKSaa	Just the chocolate ones!<br>  <br>  EEWWW!|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Yeah I can't stand them they're all too chemically I ask my husband not to buy them.|`|IBkrMUGOaa	you are very wierd my fave axe is dark temtation otherwise know as chocolate|`|cd932982e598ef116b4851208ba36033aa	I don't think the smell of them r disgusting I just thing guys. Use way too much of it|`|UhSbRMPhaa	Ooohhh me!!!<br>  I got stuck in the car once with a guy I was dating who decided to marinate himself in axe (while in the car). I wanted to crawl out the window. Needless to say I bought him a bottle of Chanel for men about a week later, because it was worth the investment of not having to smell axe every time I was with him.<br>  <br>  I would rather a guy wore no cologne than cheap cologne. And it is very easy to tell the difference between Axe and Tagg vs. real cologne because the extra alcohol in Axe and Tagg makes them have a distinct (and not good) smell. <br>  <br>  Also, I am not trying to sound "stuck up" here, but there is an implied social stigma that is associated with cheap cologne (which most ladies can spot from a mile away). When a guy spends $3 on cologne, it implies that he is perhaps "cheap" or doesn't care about/respect himself enough to buy quality fragrance. And often a woman will draw the conclusion that if a guy does not respect himself, he will not respect her. Since your scent can sometimes reach others before you even get a chance to make a visual first impression, it is very important not to project an "I don't respect myself" or "I am cheap" impression. <br>  <br>  When it comes to men's fragrance, if you cannot afford high quality fragrance, do not wear any at all (or try to find some at TJ Maxx or Ross... this is what I do). Don't let people draw erroneous first impressions based on your scent. Let yourself woo others with your amazing personality first!!|`|B3gtFkPraa	they are DELICIOUS shut yo face =p

1Du1CMXeaa	1. no. it will only give you highlights that are a bit lighter.<br>  2. my friend has caramel brown eyes and she looks great with purple eyeliner, but it also has to match your skin tone.<br>  4. i have braces too i get light blue because i find they make them look kindof nicer and not at all yellowish but they dont stand out.<br>  5. i have white tea moisturiser, basic but amazing. smells great too. <br>  6. back to basics, theyre the best, stretch first then 20 sit ups in two blocks, 10 push-ups, 10 lunges, 5 min stair climbs, repeat whatever you want for however long you want then stretch again.<br>  7. white will bring out your tan, nice boho kinda patterend things.<br>  8. i cant help you there. search the department stores, they have good variety.<br>  9. theyre out there but most have them in, no one wants skin cancer!|`|6ESUnzQjaa	1. No lemon juice will not make your hair orange!<br>  2. Mascara creates a winged eyeliner. Just take out the wand from the bottle of mascara and swipe a brush around the inside rim. A more pointy tip will help the line be more percise.<br>  3.Rubber Band color for braces... hmm.. i dont have braces but my friends that did always looked good in pink, or blue/turquoise. I would go for a solid color.<br>  4. My fav lotion is deffinatly Sweet Craving- Moodi. You can find this at Victorias Secret. <br>  5. Some good quick work outs would be to do some sit ups to get a nice flat tummy. Take a walk, or jog everyday ( or try to)  to stregthen up leg muscels. <br>  6. Green would be a nice color. Not sure though because i am blonde. My mom has dark hair. I think the best colors would be the greens, purples, medium blues, hot pinks.<br>  7. Victorias secret-good push up bra.<br>  8. If you have sensitve skin then i would just go for Eucerin- Calming Cream, Daily Moisurizer. No SPF|`|InzHK1rcaa	1. not sure<br>  2. Dark brown<br>  4. Purple most def it's cute and looks good on your teeth<br>  5. hmm that's gotta be... I like the stuff from Victoria's Secret xD.<br>  6. OMG I AM THE MASTER OF WORKING OUT :) mkay so what I like to do is when I watch TV I will swing my hips round and round and it actually burns a lot of calories without being hard or distracting me from the show (and I'm better at dancing hip-swinging-wise now too, lol.  t's like putting oil on a door they go around and around and i'm like yayy). Then when the commercials go on, you do one type of excersize for the entire length of the commercial. Some of them are long and this can be painful but it works. Here's my routine:<br>  Squats for butt<br>  Squats while on toes (it's hard to explain but it works the inner thigh and is REALLY painful lol I got it from seventeen magazine)<br>  Crunches for upper abs<br>  Crab crunches (excersizes your arms)<br>  Leg raises for lower abs<br>  <br>  So I'll do squats for a commercial, then it ends and another commercial comes on and I'll do squats on toes etc etc until the commercials end and I'll be back to the show and swing my hips again. it works well :)<br>  <br>  7. Green. Red. Blue. White.<br>  <br>  8. Target has TONS<br>  9. Cetaphil :) (get the oil-free one)
2oN7WrVKaa	No, just dont get any with tingle in them, it usually turns you bright pink for a few hours.<br>  Lotion just helps bring out the sun.<br>  It isnt going to make you spotty at all.<br>  I would give it a try.|`|CktiV6KJaa	You will not look ridiculous.<br>  Plus, I just go in without lotion, because it makes me itch.|`|sfjMv6bdaa	Good luck with Cancer...<br>  <br>  So sad what's happened to people, you don't even need a tan, it barely makes a difference and makes you look hella fake.... But you'd rather sacrifice your health/Life for a little more Beauty.... Unbelievable.|`|bDpQYyuNaa	no you will not look bad..you can barely even tell
2e36923da51c815eb4096942999c182baa	Be advised <br>  that Piercings are UN-NATURAL<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Smile <br>  Mother Earth Loves U!|`|m2Q2099Vaa	i think one side would look better.<br>  it hurts about as much as cartilage.<br>  it's ok to clean.<br>  it takes about 6 months.|`|NdWTVdFzaa	It's supposed to be either one of, or the most painful cartilage piercing...that and the conch. I have a conch(and yes, it was more painful than any of my other piercings...I've got 3 other cartilage piercings, both sides of my nose, both sides of my lip, navel..and than normal lobes, and stretched lobes), but not an anti-tragus.<br>  I think whether you get one side or both is up to you...try one side first, and than decide later if you want the other side also, since it'll be easier to sleep..I don't think only one side looks stupid though.<br>  <br>  Cartilage takes about a year to heal completely, and it's prone to hypertrophic scarring.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully someone who has one can come along and help you out more...<br>  <br>  <br>  lil, helix piercings are commonly just referred to as 'cartilage piercings', that's what I'm thinking she meant by cartilage... but yeah the anti-tragus is a cartilage piercing also..|`|HvbIE03saa	An antitragus piercing is done in cartilage, just so you know. The whole ear is cartilage.<br>  <br>  I think you were meaning  "...a lobe piercing..."

AA10443171	Piercings I got for the look, tattoos I got to express myself.  Funny how I hardly have any of the piercings anymore (I have my lobes gauged to 2g, holes behind them @ 12g & cartilage @ 12g...retired eyebrow, navel, & nipples) but I don't regret any of my 7 tattoos...|`|NdWTVdFzaa	I like the way they look, and how when I get a new one it just automatically fits and seems like it's been there forever.<br>  I suppose since I like them it's also a way of expressing what I like, and how I see myself in my mind.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	I get tattoos for the look I want.  I could care less what others think of them, I am happy with the way they look, and I'm what matters.  The tattoos also allow me to express who I am to those that care enough to inquire.  I suppose its both, but for selfish reasons maybe...but they're mine, so I guess I can be selfish|`|H76IjEiPaa	I do it to express myself. If I wanted attention, all I have to do is pull out my penis. That alone would stop traffic.|`|jp9OzuXoaa	The look, which technically expresses myself as well. So both. :)|`|5jsMY4RIaa	Both|`|fVca0uK2aa	piercings for looks and tattoos to express myself and who i am|`|6JzgBhRQaa	both|`|sweQiOj9aa	Great question.  I've found that most people who feel a need to "express themselves" with tattoos and body piercings are, generally, quite uneducated and shallow.  There is really no other reason for having your skin decimated by an unsanitary needle except for that fact that there are so many uneducated, shallow people who think it's cool.  The other factors are a) done time in prison or b) been overseas in the service and did it on a drunk dare.  These are the facts and they are, indesputable....:)|`|AA11124953	both<br>  they make me feel special<br>  different<br>  and ppl think they are cool|`|CEKZsoFRaa	To express myself with my own unique look.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It's a great way to take something you think is beautiful and show it off in your own way.|`|anfhcnWeaa	i get tattoos as a form of expression, a way for me to express the love i have for the gaming industry, yeah i'm a gamer and my ink shows that.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	Both, really.  I like the way they look, but the particular ones I choose are to express myself.|`|gDHsx5I3aa	Yes to express myself but i also like pain... hahaha|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	no, unless I wanted to be like everyone else

Leave it overnight, and in the morning I can guarantee you will have nice, tight curls.|`|9ccCHZHgaa	Don't comb through it after using curlers O_O just separate the strands of hair with your finger.<br>  A curling iron must work, maybe you're just using it the wrong way. If you have very straight hair, you might want to use some kind of hairspray on it before curling it (not too much though). It'll help. and when you're done, you can put hairspray again, or mousse. Depends on what you like.|`|lxJoXNZwaa	Try:<br>  hot rollers<br>  wave iron<br>  or<br>  when you use your curling iron - begin curling from the top (near the roots) of your hair first and just spiral down to the ends; then wait a few minutes and just run your fingers through the curls and apply a light hairspray.|`|M961DkIjaa	I don't know.

eLeNisZBaa	It would depend. Do you think your identity calls for you to wear a cap? Is wearing that cap giving off the right message about who you are? If you want to do it to feel cool, go ahead. But if you feel uncomfortable doing it, then maybe it's not you. There are alternatives to wearing a cap to distinguish your own identity. Just because your friend wears one and he looks cool and comfortable doesn't mean you'll get the same results with yourself. Just wear what you want to wear, try out wearing a cap and see how it is. It's all about experimenting with what you're comfortable with.<br>  <br>  (Most Highschools let you wear caps. It's just the problem with indoors since teachers might think you're hiding something like ear phones or cheat notes.)|`|7PJFouzPaa	if you like it do it. as long as you feel confident in it. everything looks bad if your not sure about it. if your thinking about it all the time take it off.|`|6JzgBhRQaa	wear whatever you want!<br>  if you can pull it off then go for it!|`|0rGrdRotaa	its fine;; if u wanna wear a fitted then wear one but if u dont want it 2 seems over night then start wearing them after spring break|`|eNCadlpaaa	matters if it looks good on you or not.

98LDN0Quaa	shaving it over and over will just make the hair follicles thicker, not make you grow more hair...nothing basically, try that spay ****...lol|`|QPVEL0NLaa	unfortunately the only way is beyond your control. It is genetics. All of us are patterned to grow hair differently. All the shaving in the world won't make it thicker. Sorry!!|`|154dzJ1Faa	You can't.  You got what you got.  There is no way to make thicker hair.  You have all the follicles you will ever have when you were born.  You never get any new ones.  As you get older, some of these follicles start producing longer darker hair at certain ages, some change colour, and some stop growing hair at all.<br>  <br>  Some men will never get a very thick beard.  My brother at over 50 still can't grow a moustache.  The idiots that say you can make hair thicker by shaving simply don't know anything.  There is NOTHING you can on the surface that will affect the hair.  All hair comes from under the skin -- they can be affected by health, disease and nutrition, and emotions to a certain extent as well as some drugs.  But it usually grows according to its own schedule.  If you don't have a full beard, you don't. You may have to grow up, or it may never develop.  That's just the way it is.|`|uAzToWC7aa	keep shaving so that it gets thicker each time

First of all, the tags of Burberry bags don't look like the one in the picture. I can tell from the picture alone that the bag is counterfeit. I have a Burberry bag that's why I know. Sorry.

They may even consider it color correction, more money Cost depends on color you want  & what it takes to get there, where you live and the type of salon you go to. You could go to Sally's they have pro products and they can assist you. If you have someone with some experience you should be able to do it at home.Bleach only enough to lift out the black & get close to your target color. Don't bleach your roots they will come up way too light, if you have to just a little time while at the end.|`|ipaAiX8xaa	It could be about $35 to $75 depending on where you go! It could possibly run even more. At my local salon it costs about $55.|`|Ovn7040naa	Don't attempt this at home, you will never get your desired result. go to a professional colorist it should be $50-$100 per hour, or a end price of about $200-$400. at least you will get what you want...

9ccCHZHgaa	Okay well you can shave. It takes a layer of skin off your legs, but you can put cream on it afterwards and it should be okay (for the rash too). <br>  The creams are kind of bad, I agree.<br>  The best option is waxing, but you can also try an epilator (is that what you mean by the "electric thing"? Unless you're talking about the laser or electrolysis thing?). An epilator is basically like plucking your legs but really faster. It's kind of expensive though... it may cost around 50-80 $ but it's worth it.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Well you covered it all. Sorry! when you are older Laser or electrolysis but expensive.

Jh0yyYizaa	I don't like putting on stuff that blocks my pores either,<br>  thats why I only wear foundation on special occasions (I'm gonna buy a bare minerals foundation soon tho so I can wear it as much as I like and know its not damaging my skin). <br>  For brown eyes, you can make yourself look really classy by applying a lighter brown/cream eyeshadow. Its nice for a natural day look. <br>  For going out, look for a dark gold. <br>  On waterline, apply white eyeliner and then softly apply powder just underneath and apply a soft eyeliner half way across the eye to the outer eye. (The reason you apply powder before hand is to make the eyeliner stay and not smudge) This is what I do and I look my best :)|`|YXCDdDKIaa	I like bronzer, i have several different kinds and shades. <br>  <br>  This last one i think is a bit dark, they are the bead ones and i also have this other one that is too light so i add them together to try to get a happy medium shade.

You haven't a clue about me....to you Lumenis, it all depends upon the woman...or man for that matter. Some think they are doing you a favour by shaving (yes really...).....I have even had it said to me by men and women. It is personal preference.....I will say this too...I have done it all...and I loathe that alleged 'clean' look, the totally Brazilian daddy's little girl look. (So sick..)...most men and women I know do feel this way...underarms for the most part, and I am an advocate of thisfor myself...and I KNOW it is conditioning, but I like them shaved...i have experimented with many different ways of grooming. Why you might ask? For my own pleasure....for sex does feel different when shaven in certain ways both men and women. It is to heighten and not be an object or toy....who are you kidding people..a landing strip...oh I know what you mean and for one gf of mine that was fine.....but it did nothing for me. Apparently it did for her for vaginal and clitoral stimulous.....it must be done right...or just leave it. Good grief people it is only hair...and if you think that you are going to get into my pants...try getting my mind stimulated first.....and few of you could. Lumenis your question is a valid one..and the answers are plentiful ~ Maybe experiment with it...see what you think...but the die hards on personal baldness need a lesson.... the upkeep is laborious and I have far better things to do with my time. It is personal preference full stop....but to those who make an issue out of beat it...as in get lost. I have experienced both men and women in various phases of 'growth' ~ ultimately what entices me is their brains....however your question is quite valid....and HONEST. Fair play to you.<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|zPvxaOYoaa	i love it clean|`|1LTrZbxwaa	Trust me most guys like it bald or with a little landing strip, most do not like the the fro, although some do. <br>  <br>  But its not a big deal, its not a deal breaker or anything, at least for most guys.|`|5mCm2XTLaa	Depends on what you and your boyfriend are into.

I would say curl it, like REALLY curly, ringlette's.  Then you can leave it down put in some hairspray and your good to go.  Or sticking with the curls, put it in a side pony tail, it would look really cute and put your bangs up with some barrettes, some people call it a "bubble" maybe try a new style, like 2 brades on either side.  Also maybe you could crimp it.

When I'm feeling really creative I'll take a toothpick and black polish and draw really intricate designs like you might see in gothic eye makeup such as swirls or ankhs or spider webs.

Before that I just kept it out of the sun. .<br>  <br>  If it's a small to medium size I would saying healing would take 1-3 weeks. I know nothing about bigger tattoos. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps!

F7xZqi7Xaa	It depends if your belly button ring is sterling silver or fake silver. If it's real, then use toothpaste, preferably the kind with baking soda to clean it. Use an old toothbrush to scrub it and voila! Your ring will no longer look tarnished and will look shiny! e|`|1XEkmkJjaa	Well, can you take it out yet?  if not, you can only use antibacterial soap.  Turn a plastic cup full of soapy water over your navel area.  If so, read on:<br>  <br>  Is it real silver or gold?  take it out and use a special jewelry cleaning kit (search online for the best prices, best quality)<br>  <br>  Is it stainless steel?  They're cheap for a reason.  Mine all are steel, and they tarnish so easily, they just need replacing.  Sometimes the coating, which is a rhodium finish, will just flake or wear off, revealing the copper underneath.  Obviously this can't be cleaned off.  Time to invest in a new piece!|`|8lME2HFraa	Get a new one!
Jj3bxvVDaa	Dont shave ur underarms, always wax them. Shaving causes darkening and thick hairs to erupt later. waxing will reduce growth of ur hairs after some years and it will not cause any harm. waxing does not cause any type of allergy. <br>  <br>  Apply crushed almond or lime juice to the area and wax regularly.|`|wZQRw5Fwaa	i shave nearly everyday.<br>  Just coz its easy and you don't have to wait til it gets to a certain length to get rid of it (like you have to with waxing).<br>  plus it doesn't hurt.|`|mtyhSPi9aa	shave|`|0BspN06Raa	i just shave, never waxed before though.|`|8S77XpBEaa	No, I'm all NA-TU-RAL! haha JK! I shave it all off, i don't go for that stereotypical french girl style, haha. Wax would really help if you don't want to shave. Wax takes out the root of a hair and takes longer to grow. But since i shower everyday, i shave everyday!|`|wbI1rY1paa	I shave my underarms, but if your underarms are dark, try exfoliating them and trying a more moisturizing deodorant like Dove.|`|DE8EB2Kzaa	you should probably wax. then there wouldnt be any visible little black roots. and maybe your armpit wouldnt be dark. try it.|`|S2ilDvt0aa	I shave coz waxing is supposed to be painful and unnecessary.

rtx0YQDJaa	you should speak to your artist before buying and using a numbing cream. most artists would recommend not using any because it changes the consistency of the skin and the ink often takes unevenly, so the tattoo tends to heal patchy if a numbing agent is used. also it makes the skin tougher and harder to tattoo. it's better to just takes some tylenol.|`|Hbtl17b0aa	hey,<br>  umm i heard of a cream called 'angel cream' they use it in hospitals... so you cna buy it from chemists i thin its $10 for a tube!<br>  but you could just get a tato without numbing it first :P<br>  good luk,<br>  x

ldpDzaolaa	Must be new, have not used it. I like Maybelline Stilletto and L'Oreal Voluminous, drug store brands, both come off with soap and water, dove preferably.<br>   Raccoon eyes are if you are sweaty or have oily skin or don't do makeup checks during the day , or if you don't properly remove makeup the night before ,or if you sleep in eyemake. or live in a humid climate. I used to have to use water proof eye makeup when I lived in south Florida, just to avoid the makeup drudge, taking off waterproof makeup was a pain, Water proof makeup is ok if you want to wear it at the beach or go swimming/spa fun. Have fun with your new makeup and practice with it, especially before a big occassion, practice putting makeup on your friends and try different effects, just don't over do it. as people will see the makeup, your age and they won't see you. Sometimes mascara is all you need!
EnYLhQajaa	:) I love them. And I wouldn't ever think twice about wearing them. If you bought them, especially if they were $70, you should where them EVERWHERE.

qAcrK4KTaa	Big ENHANCED Boobs are the best. They look better, feel better and work better. Think about it. Big butt equals Fat ***. I mean really you hear about all the girls asking if their *** is too big and trying to save up enough money to get their Boobs Enhanced. There's even websites dedicated to getting the boobs done. Haven't heard about any such thing for butt implants. Sure if you wanna be on a rap video I guess big butt might be what you need to seal the deal. But if you wanna look hot.. then you gotta be thin like 115lb or less thin and have Huge Boobs. Fit/Thin + Big Boobs = Hawt

It just depends on where the strap is anchored, you can anchor it on one end (as a wristlet) or both.

If your hips are larger than your bust, or vice versa, you do not have model proportions<br>  <br>  If you do meet these requirements, you send in a headshot and full body shot to the agencies above and they will call you if they think you have potential|`|YR9l82vmaa	that's going to be very challenging.... but there are lots of agencies that you could look into, just try googling it.|`|XzRQjghUaa	tyra banks.|`|aWsfWiapaa	You could contact John Robert Powers...
TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|154dzJ1Faa	And what has trimming split ends have to do with making hair grow faster??<br>  <br>  You already know that there is NOTHING you can do to make your hair grow faster.  That is just not possible.  And nothing you can put on the hair on the outside is going to affect the roots under the skin, where growth happens.  As long as you are in good health, your hair will grow as it is programmed.  If you look after your hair, it will get longer.<br>  <br>  But you know, of course, that after 4 to 7 years, the hair will stop growing and fall out.

EaurpLufaa	Once again, not all women feel the same way toward this topic.  It's ignorant to assume that all women even like penis.|`|EQVFlUbEaa	It's not the most important thing to me. Yes, it's nice to be somewhat big, but it's not THE most important thing. For 1-10, with 1 being not important and 10 being very important, it'd be about a 4.<br>  <br>  I do not expect smaller men to be less good than bigger. To be honest, "Big" guys seem to have huge egos. I don't like that.<br>  <br>  Personally, i see sex as more than just the actual "intercourse" part. If a guy knows how to romantically interest the girl, that's the most important thing, and penis size becomes almost irrelivant. That's how men are so different to women. Generally, men see being 'in' a woman as the main part of sex. For us women, many of us see the foreplay is the most important. That's what gets our attention and interest. And that does not necessarily matter what size the man's penis is.<br>  <br>  Then again, some women will base their whole sexual experience on the size of the man. So it completely varies.<br>  <br>  But any women CAN have an enjoyable sexual experience with a man of any size, as long as they stay open to it and do not turn from men who they 'think' will be better based on size.|`|1RfU68lwaa	i think thickness matters more over length<br>  i dont bother with small ones though<br>  some guys are big but they dont know how to use it so its pointless|`|mzrNTI8naa	hmmm<br>  <br>  i like em long and thick<br>  <br>  xx
2ZsRAxkuaa	Lip ring retainers.. They kinda defeat the point. You want it to be less noticable, but rings are pretty hefty still. Labret retainers are a much better idea,m why don't you want one of those?<br>  <br>  But anyway, a clear one of these <a href="http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_store/circular_barbells_780.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_...</a>|`|haCssg2Laa	i have both a labret and a medusa piercing<br>  so i am not a hater<br>  <br>  but i fail to see the productivity in a lip RING retainer<br>  a retainer is used in instances when facial jewellry is not appropriate, and is used to keep a hole open until you can use visable jewellery<br>  what difference would a retainer in ring form make? you may as well use your normal lip ring<br>  i think that is why you are having problems sourcing one<br>  nothing is gained from it

They'll do it, because you're the customer and are paying them, but they aren't a fan of unoriginality.  Also don't take in a pic of another persons tat and say I want that.  They don't like copying other peoples original work, and again, it insults them.  Think of something that expresses your personality, if you're a happy upbeat bubbly personality, get something like your name with bubbles floating up from it...if you're a deep person, get a quote from a favorite author or poem or something...just do something original and for you, don't get a tattoo just to fit in and look cool.  by all means show off a tat, but don't show it to gain cred from someone else show it to gain cred from yourself...|`|x5aJcD9zaa	I totally agree with the 2nd poster.  A tattoo is usually about something special for you that matches your personality.  You don't need anyone to tell you what to get.  This is something that will be on your skin forever, so make sure it's something you want in a place you want it.<br>  <br>  Randomly going into a shop and picking one off the wall is ok, but for me, a tattoo is something a lot more personal.|`|NdWTVdFzaa	It should be something YOU want, not what a bunch of strangers suggest you to get.<br>  If you don't know what you want, it doesn't sound to me like you're completely ready for a new tattoo.|`|HvbIE03saa	If you can't figure that out for yourself without the input of a bunch of strangers, then you shouldn't get one at all.|`|sweQiOj9aa	Well Angel, the fact that you would ask what kind of tattoo you should get on a message board format tells me that you fit right in there with all the other very shallow women and uneducated, insecure, wish to be cool people.  You are definately a bimbo, so I would suggest the Bimbo logo, like the soccer team has.  It's colorful, and it says, "here I am world, and I'm not very sharp at all'...|`|4Qcmgpe7aa	tattoos should be what you want and usually, and this is just me, but they should symbolize something in your life. or else you're pretty much just drawing on yourself. something you can't erase or wash off either, think of that before you go.|`|DFH72cDiaa	u can put it on ur back <br>  or u can put it on ur leg|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Well, I have no idea what kinda personality you have so I have no idea what tattoo you should get.

g7p4Qityaa	I have a tongue ring and it hasnt wrecked my teeth. I do find that sometimes when chewing food you tend to bite it which will/can chip your teeth. (Happens rarely though) Also, when you talk sometimes it can hit your bottom front teeth which could cause them to crack... but since its the balls on the end of the barbell that are usually the culprits of the damage, Ive found that it helps if you have plastic ends instead of all metal. Oh and if you do it, make sure to keep a spare one with you for emergencies, i swallowed my tongue ring once when eating and i didnt even notice =/ lol (it came unscrewed) and once the plastic ball just cracked from me biting it while chewing my food. When I go to the dentist, he tells me horror stories of people having problems with their tongue rings... but I havent experienced it besides minor chips.

ZkrGttKaaa	Your endorphins kick in after a few minutes, and help mask the discomfort. If you were getting one on your ribcage, that's serious death row. But the skin on your back is pretty tough. Not like the skin on your abdomen! You'll be okay.|`|cbWfIKaYaa	It does hurt but it's not anything that isn't tolerable. I agree that a numbing agent is not a good idea. You do get kind of used to it after a while, but you can definitely still feel it. I describe it as little ant bites, nothing that hurts too bad but you can feel it. I think it also depends on your pain tolerance level, some people are really wimpy and they are probably the ones you heard of fainting or crying the whole time.|`|QgHUVEldaa	its close to the bone, if your skinny it will hurt but nothing you wont be able to stand. if you have ever got a shot or cinged yourself on something hott it kinda feels like that only not that bad. you get use to it and if your tolerance is high then it will slowly fade. <br>  Tattoo wouldn't be aloud if they were hurting people so bad that they faint. Just find a good artist and talk to them before you get it.<br>  dont trip you ll be surprised when its done.|`|3xz9lgB4aa	OOOOOHHHH<br>  bad place...<br>  i have wings and as soon as they got to the shoulder blades.. thats when it got really painful. but tattoos are painful. you dont get numb but you get use to the pain and get more tolerant of it. when i got my first tattoo i was expecting it to hurt A LOT but it still didnt prepare me for it.<br>  but it hurts less in some areas than others, with some other of my tattoos the pain wasnt bad|`|fjCxv2I4aa	my last tattoo wasnt too bad until id been getting needled on for 6 hours.if its going to be shorter length of time than that,dont sweat it.beside,most anasthesia ointments are for topical use only,and it will penetrate your skin when the needles pierce through.|`|bZiAr0Djaa	I have 5 tattoos. shoulder, tramp stamp, ankle, side of lower leg, and top of foot.

Some people say that after 30min it doesn't hurt anymore, but its not with everyone.<br>  <br>  it feels like a constant bad cat scratch. Like that constant sting.<br>  <br>  People have fainted because they get themselves ridiculously hyped up over it.

OHfZFR31aa	No, you will not be able to attend all of the ones that are from 3-4, and probably won't make the one from 4-5. An open call can take anywhere from 30 minutes - 2 hours depending how many people show up that week. You may be asked to fill out an application when you arrive, then sit around waiting until they call you in. <br>  <br>  If there are 10 people, then they may look at you one-on-one. If there are 200 people (not unusual at a big agency like Ford or Wilhelmina) then the panel will see you in groups of 5-10 people. But it can take a long time.<br>  <br>  Because you can't see all of the agencies at the same time, I would send in pictures in advance to as many agencies as possible. If they call and want to see you, it will be one-on-one rather than with a big group, and it definitely won't be at the same time as the open calls.<br>  <br>  Wear something that shows off your body - skinny jeans or leggings, high heels (the highest you can walk in to make your legs look longer) and a fitted tank top. Or a mini skirt and fitted top. They want to be able to see your bust, waist and hip measurements even when you are clothed. Makeup should be kept to a minimum and hair pulled back if it's long. Nails should be short and groomed - have you ever seen a model with long acrylic airbrushed nails? And any piercings except for ears should be removed. Earrings should be simple and other jewelry kept to a minimum. The focus should be on your face, skin and body, not what you are wearing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
4T9fZzITaa	omgosh i have a friend who has his hair like that<br>  well.. i suggest you let your hair grow out<br>  then take a pic of him and the hairstyle to a hairdresser so that she may cut it like that. and if you have to buy a straightener.|`|DE8EB2Kzaa	youd have to cut it to that length. and then flat iron it for the bang to stay to the side neatly. and the ends are turned up a bit.
MZWH11w1aa	I think you should first decide if you want the handbag to be carried on your shoulder or just hand carried.  If you like the shoulder idea, throw out the Speedy & Alma.  It looks like you like large bags, it's good that you have decided on size already.  I would then go to how much you would use colors.  The Damier Ebony will match almost everything, but it doesn't close on top.  Does that matter to you?  The purple and red will not match as many outfits.  You also have to be careful with Vernis.  I am super careful with my bags, but I know not everyone is.  I would vote for the Mahina in #1 black and # 2 white.  It is less common and very classic.  It's also not too "in your face" as vuitton goes.  Yay, have fun with your purchase!!!|`|PPGAE4n3aa	i would suggest anything that is a classic style and the monogram, it may sound boring but you want to get as much use out of your first LV as possilbe. buying something trendy will limit how much you want to carry it later on down the road when its out of style.|`|UuLZBX9daa	The purple Surya, I'm looking at buying it myself!|`|M5tqVX8Baa	I have both the speedy and neverfull.

It cannot change colour.<br>  <br>  However, if you damage your hair, you will get hair to get lighter.  That is because you have opened up the hair, and the colour molecules can be removed, along with other things from the hair.  You always know if you have damaged hair because of the lighter colour.<br>  <br>  As you get older, your hair usually changes to a darker shade.  That is normal and natural.  The only way to make your hair lighter again is by bleaching, whether you use peroxide, or lemon juice, or any of the intense bleaches, it's all the same-- you damage the hair to some degree to allow the colour to come out.<br>  <br>  Shampoo is only for cleaning the hair and scalp -- not to damage the hair!|`|oWVUiDEMaa	Add lemon juice to your shampoo.|`|98LDN0Quaa	john frieda, or sunsilk hair brightner shampoo...or theres this stuff you can spray into your hair then stand in the sun and it'll lightnen it.

It only makes waves.<br>  <br>  If you want curls you need to curl it.  That means rolling it up into round shapes when it is wet and letting it dry.  You can use rollers, or pin curls, or twisting it around your fingers -- as long as you get it into a round shape, and then letting it dry that way.  I suggest a hood-type dryer for best results.  The hair must be completely and fully dry before touching it.  Any dampness will result in drooping and perhaps waves, but never curls.<br>  <br>  You can use hot rollers or curling irons (if you know how), but they don't seem to last as long as a wet set.  A set will last for a couple days.|`|juczLKDEaa	I have no idea what the dream curls technique is so I can't help you there but to be honest it doesn't sound like it would work.<br>  <br>  If you braid then it's just going to be wavy cause that's what I use to get mine wavy.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is with the curling iron and on the parts you want wavy use small braids in your hair [sleep in them] and then after you wash it get one of those gels for your hair idk what there called but then you just squeeze your hair in bunches as it's wet.<br>  <br>  Also a shampoo that works so great for curls and if you want them this is like the best thing you can buy in my opinion it's called "Curls Rock" I think, basically it's those neon bottles at any store. You don't have to go a salon for this.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!!!!! :)))|`|DE8EB2Kzaa	i was gonna ask if youd already tried braiding it. but yes, you have. maybe you should just go to a salon. unless you want to do it yourself.|`|98LDN0Quaa	try and buy a diffuser attachment for your hair dryer...with moose and stuff like that for sure
f31691c7cb556d0d74c032f9da6c3696aa	Figure out what your natural level is, if it's a dark brown, that could be anywhere from a level 2 to a level 4, depending on what your definition of dark brown is.  <br>  <br>  When you know that, you're going to need 2 different colours because you said you wanted to cover up grey.   I personally love Wella or Schwarzkopf for colour lines.  <br>  <br>  Let's say you're a level 3.  You need to get the 3-0/N (-0 or -N is the same - they both mean "natural series" which you need to have some of that in your formula to cover grey).  If you have 25% grey in your hair, 1/4 of your formula needs to include 3-0/N.  Anything above that should have 1/2.<br>  <br>  Then the other colour should be in the same level (3-??).  ?? is whatever tone you want deposited in your hair.  So if you want it to have a red tint to it, chocolate brown, etc.  This is honestly preference.  You have to see how the colour is mixed. Normally it's 1:1.  Which means, 1 part colour, 1 part developer.  Mix with a 20 vol developer, as that covers grey.<br>  <br>  Timing depends on the company.  They will have instructions.
GZKbvXLLaa	Yes, that's easy to do. Always keep your brush clean while working with it. If you find acrylic is starting to build up, clean it using monomer and wipe it on a lint free brush wipe. After you are done, always use fresh, clean monomer to clean your brush with. Put it in the monomer, and wipe well on a brush wipe. Repeat this process until the brush is totally clean, usually that means dipping and wiping three or four times. Roll the tip of the brush into a point on a clean, unused brush wipe and store properly. If you find that acrylic hardens on the brush, obviously you didn't clean it well enough. In that case, never force the hardened acrylic off the brush in any way. This will usually ruin the brush hairs. Instead, simply leave the brush soaking in monomer for a few hours (only up close to the ferrule, but no further than that). Then, try to wipe the softened acrylic off of the brush. If some remains on the brush, soak a little longer, and try again. Avoid using acetone, alcohol, or anything other than monomer to clean your brush with. <br>  For best results, always use a high quality Kolinsky sable brush. Anything else is a waste of both time, and money.<br>  I hope this helps...|`|B3ajoPbXaa	After you are done using, my nail lady wipes it down with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

AsnGFwafaa	Well, "beautiful" is often mistaken for "hot". Ha! They could not be more different. Hot = one night stand; big chest; nice legs, whatever. Anyone can be hot as long as they cake themselves with boxes of makeup. Guys at the adolescent age usually just refer to girls they find attractive as hot.<br>  <br>  Beautiful, to me, is natural, is classic. They don't have to have a model figure, tall height, big eyes, plump lips. Beautiful people just give off a beautiful aura. You can tell!<br>  <br>  Sexy = exotic. Anyone can be sexy. It's all in the way you talk, walk, smile, the ease in which you meet someone else's gaze. Sexy sends a shiver down your spine, like, I want to know this person. They just present themselves in a mysteriously confident way. <br>  <br>  This is how I think it should be ranked, the lower down the list, the more of a compliment it is:<br>  <br>  Hot<br>  Cute<br>  Pretty<br>  Attractive<br>  Sexy<br>  Beautiful/Handsome<br>  Gorgeous|`|JZgSFv4xaa	for a woman, sexy is usually exotic looking to me<br>  a woman who doesn't look like every other girl out there<br>  unique style that's still girly and beautiful<br>  <br>  for a man, handsome is uaully bright big eyes<br>  big dimples and think dark hair<br>  <br>  actually I'm a big brunette fan so both need thick dark hair hah|`|e2JxDMAZaa	looks and personality and character|`|7fsqT04Iaa	looks confidence|`|UtktKSLKaa	It is the ora they give off. If they have a really likable personality but are average looking, some people will still consider them beautiful. Mainly, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Same with sexiness. If they give off an ora that they think they are sexy and it is believable, other people are likely to think they are sexy. That is just my opinion though. Everyone is beautiful/sexy in their own unique way.|`|DE8EB2Kzaa	im assuming you werent talking about inner beauty...<br>  <br>  handsome typically refers to guys. and ive heard beautiful referred to both men and women (mostly women). but sexy is a totally different thing. someone who wouldnt traditionally be considered attractive can be sexy. sexy all depends on how a person carries themself, how they feel about themself, and how confident they are. in this case, beauty (beautiful, handsome) is purely physical. sexy is another thing. a person can be extremely attractive but if they have low self-esteem it shows, and thats not sexy. nobody wants a doormat.|`|kUA21UKFaa	I guess everybody has it’s own taste on what attractive is.<br>  I like tall dark guys with curly hair and big big hands, witty...with a big big heart that hug a lot...for me that is VERY attractive.|`|DsFnePKXaa	face, hair, skin, body, personality.|`|PpMA8Tcxaa	plastic surgery. <br>  nah jk i hate that stuff... only good for ppl who did it after recovering from breast cancer or something...|`|CmZJohb7aa	pheromones|`|A91tV4P5aa	in the eyes of the beholder|`|3zxVzPBxaa	clear skin, big eyes, plump lips. it's more of a natural thing.|`|of049X1waa	confidence!  also, to me, bravery and a daring attitutde.|`|vABufZ1Laa	their eyes and clear face

CkIeCNS4aa	Yes, you just had a needle inject ink under your skin.  It's normal for it to be red and swollen.

Just remember to put on lotion everyday on it and if you are going to be in the sun put on sun tan lotion because otherwise it will fade. It also may start peeling or scabbing but DO NOT PICK OR PEEL. This is part of the healing process. If you pick at a scab it may scar so just continue to put on lotion everyday, and I recommend twice at the day at the beginning :)|`|765eZqh7aa	yes I have 5 tattoos they all were slightly swollen around the first couple of days.

aEpPt9koaa	Frizzy hair is a result of dry and sometimes damaged hair. To treat it always use a leave in conditioner and do a deep protein conditioner twice a month. I have been deep conditioning my hair for years and now when I'm in humid conditions my hair doesn't frizz up on me. It has to be extremely humid, like steam room humid for my hair to frizz now.|`|Zi0g5K3Iaa	The reason is your hair is too dry.You'd better massage the hair care products to your hair every time you wash your hair.|`|rvMWXJSMaa	Humidity. =p <br>  It's just natural.<br>  Prevent by getting de-frizz products/cream to smooth in hair
rgNP0Qo6aa	Well, my nurse who does my treatments says some people take advil, and a lot of people take vicodin. Some people come in drunk and one person even brings in a flask and drinks during the procedure. If you can get your hands on prescription pain killers like vicodin or hydrocodine I highly recommend it, just go to a doctor and tell them you have back pain =) Here's my normal answer too in case it helps you any =)<br>  <br>  Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!

gq2l01E8aa	I have very curly hair naturally, and ever since I bought a flat iron my hair stays straight through any weather.  I understand that you are on a budget, but spending a little more will affect how damaged your hair gets.  Cheap flat irons are made of plastic or metal, but the better ones, like the one I purchased, are made of ceramic and will not damage your hair as much.  I got mine on Amazon.com for about $120.|`|8lME2HFraa	Flat Irons|`|7XH0kdoeaa	My hairdresser sold me one for I think 40 or 50 dollars. It works great and NEVER fails. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT use drug store straighteners. Most of the time they do not work and just damage your hair. They do not work like in the commercials, trust me. My friend bought one, complete disaster. Go straight to your hair salon and ask them to order one for you. It make take a few weeks to arrive, but you can be assured that it's good quality.|`|9aa84ceb3a15809f97fc6b6165606719aa	Wet2Straight from Remington, it should be around 30 dollars.|`|rRNqHhQVaa	Go to a local wal-mart, you can get a good one for about $20. thats actually what I use. I love it.|`|xFd9PJTuaa	You can get a good one for $50.<br>  Just make sure it's ceramic.<br>  <br>  The only variations will be width and max heat. <br>  <br>  That simple.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure to use some sort of heat protection spray!!!!!! It's very important to keep from damaging your hair. Tresemme makes a good one.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)
c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	even the best ones only straighten for about 6 mths or so.  and then you still have to straighten the roots that come in.|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	put a straightener in your hair|`|1b3a3c6c259e28ae8fc3b0763fce3665aa	I think it's only up to 6 months, if you're just straighten your hair. or you could rebond your hair and it's for 1 year or maybe permanent and your hair will be always smooth and shiny. trust me... ;)|`|yfkzoY7jaa	It can't stay straight for more than about 4 months. Then you have to redo the roots.
VgTWfAG2aa	try to wash luke warm water using face towel  to your face,it helps to open pores and wash it with soap and then rinse. use toner because it cleanses and it wont clog the pores with dirt. i used PONDS toner,it really works..don't pinch or popped them it will only leave an ugly scar on your face. or you can use facial cleanser and used moisturizing cream after so it won't leave your skin dry.|`|E9yfauDMaa	dont pop them. that may cause scarring just like mine. if your face is oily wash your face 3 or 4 times a day with a mild cleanser like cetaphil or preferred brand. also use pimple minimizer ointment like clean and clear. dont touch your face and check your lifestyle. sleeping late, eating habits (well worsen pimples), allergies.|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	pop them
Dvawm8Ezaa	-Definitely mascara, if you think black is too extreme for you get a brown colour. <br>  -A little case of light pink or peach or even tan blush.<br>  -Some powder, you don't want a shiney/greasy looking face!<br>  -Clear lip gloss or a lightly tinted pink|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	An eyelash curler, mascara and clear lip gloss are the most essential.  After that you could get a loose powder to cover shine, and eyeliner.<br>  <br>  Save the heavy foundation and eye shadow for awhile.  You don't want to transform into a heavy makeup wearer overnight.|`|8osMkLe1aa	For eye makeup start off with mascara, dark brown eyeliner and some natural looking shades of eye shadow. Neutral colours like tan and brown are good as well as pastel colours like light pink and purple, although it depends on your skin colour. Don't get anything crazy like lime green. For your skin I would suggest you get a concealer and just apply a small amount over any pimples and be careful to blend in the edges so it matches the rest of your face. I like Almay Clear Complexion concealer. It has salicylic acid so it actually helps treat pimples as well as covering them.|`|BGKLrcRiaa	basic makeup:<br>  -mascara. dark brown or black. just for the basic colors.<br>  -eyeliner. brown or black. just for the basic colors. pencil would be better than liquid.<br>  -lip gloss. i recommend neutrogena. it hydrates and gloss.<br>  -blush. nothing too dark for your skin.<br>  -powder foundation. try to find a shade that matches your skin color.<br>  <br>  extra:<br>  -smokey eye palette, if you wish. smokey eye is popular these days.|`|0AXgXFpraa	get some mascara.<br>  try dark brown dont use black if ur just starting , unless u want to.<br>  and uhmm , maybe some powder, but that depends on ur age  , so<br>  if ur about 14 or over then sure.<br>  <br>  answer mine ?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmqR4kxcfd9khY4ToYz6ioPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307124324AA0yedK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4Q1asqr5aa	foundation<br>  mascara<br>  eye liner<br>  <br>  <br>  just keep it simple so u wony look l;ike u became a hooker overnight|`|QwbOCHSTaa	Okay, make sure to get some powdered cover up to match your skin tone and buy a brush to apply it with. Try to avoid using the pads that come with some of them. They don't work very well. <br>  <br>  Next, get some eye shadow that has instructions on how to apply it correctly. I have several things of ALMAY eye shadow. They come in 3 different but coordinated colors and each one has instructions on how to apply it to flatter yourself the most. There are other brands that do similar stuff as well. The key is to not use a heavy amount of it or you will end up looking slutty. Trust me that is not fun. <br>  <br>  Also if you don't have any already, get some clear lip gloss or some that closely matches your lip color. Avoid the cheep stuff with the different flavors. They do absolutely nothing.|`|LoLx0szUaa	I'd say, buy mascara (brown or black), eyeliner, eye shadow, and blush (:<br>  stick to the light colors, maybe neutrals, or light pinks if your just starting out.  I'm not to sure what brands are good for starting out but when i started out I used bare minerals and I found that it was light and easy to work with, so I definitely recommend that, and when you have gotten tired with that move on to mac makeup or other ones, I find that mac makeup has many nice selections of eye make up though.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck ?|`|JSx9PZdiaa	I'm 13 and i just wear eye makeup. I use Soft Black Mascara, usually some kind of blue or sliver to gray eyeshadow, and brown or black eyeliner. It all depends on your style. I am more of a rocker kind of style, so if you are, wear funky colors. If your girly, wear light colors that blend. Just make sure it is approved by the school and your mom.|`|lr7DZSFqaa	-eyeliner <br>  -mascara [remember to get an eyelash curler as well]<br>  -neutral and light eyeshadow<br>  <br>  you shouldnt use foundation because its not that good for your skin. just get some consealer to cover up the pimples. <br>  <br>  if you have an oily face you should get the shine-free powders to control the shine. make sure it doesnt clog your pores though, it can cause you to have more pimples.|`|76cercFraa	try the new maybelline lash stiletto mascara and check out sephora and mac i dont know if u wanna jump to a big price yet <br>  if u want powder plz dont but something from a drugstore i think foundation and powder and blush are the only expensive things to spend ur money on try mac foundation or smashbox for eyeliners i recommend urban decay and for eyeshadows definetely mac a good primer:too faced shadow insurance and lipstick:anywhere<br>  <br>  hope i helped and good luck finding good makeup :)|`|Qt3QIc7baa	ok when i first started wearing makeup i wore mascara,  pencil eyeliner powder, now i wear liquid eyeliner, mascara, concealer, foundation, sometimes blusher ( i'm 13 ) i started wearing makeup when i was around 11 or 12|`|xndsR3L3aa	deff some powder. dont want to be looking shiny.  mascara is a bigggg yes and maybe some light eyeshadow like a gold or silver shimmer. if you are kinda pale like myself some very pink blush put on very lightly is good too

B3uvhA7kaa	Wow, that's not bad at all. I'm 5 feet and about 105 pounds. <br>  What I suggest is that you eat healthy. Anything Special K, fruits, vegetables, wheat pasta, wheat bread, wheat rice. No junk food.<br>  <br>  Also, swim laps in the pool for an hour at least twice or three times a week. It works out everything in your body, especially your stomach. I did swimming in 5th grade, and boy was I skinny! It also helps your upper arms, gives you muscles, and your legs too. Do crunches, maybe 100 a day. <br>  Go running or ride your bike; that also helps lots. Dance, too. It's fun and it keeps you in shape. :)<br>  But really, you don't need to loose weight. You're perfectly fine.|`|plGuYnNDaa	Just keep an exercise routine (30 mins- 1hour/day) and stick to it and you will see results but you can't give up on it or it wont work.. And just little things like when you are hungry choose fruits or veggies over like chocolate and junk.. and instead or pop or juice, drink water... Eat 6 small meals a day and dont over eat.. If you stick to this you should drop 5-10lbs within a month or 2.. (depending on your body..) Good luck! :):)|`|iLAABPGDaa	heck, your weight probably fluctuates 2 pounds eeach day (from having food in your stomach and not) so you really only want to lose 2 pounds.

What she did is give you an acrylic overlay. She basically covered up your toenail with an artificial toenail. The liquid is called monomer, the powder is the acrylic. You can probably buy it at Sally's beauty supply.. But you're better off just having her do it for you now and again.  <br>  Eventually, it will grow out and you'll have a ridge at your cuticle.

kxlmcG4gaa	Even if they did watch the CCTV, i really doubt that they would recognise you, i mean how many girls/women/teenagers do they get in there everyday?<br>  Just get over it,<br>  Or if your still feeling guilty take it back tomorrow and say how your Baby sister/brother/cousin put it in there prams and you found it after you got home.|`|xBTVAuF3aa	You are in with the wrong crowd I would hate to say. Anyways the probability of them looking at those tapes is extremely slim and if they did see the tapes its not like they know your name, they arent gonna go on an extreme criminal hunt over some headbands. I have been in your exact position before, of course I was scared and paranoid but I dropped that friend and luckily it was the right thing to do because I learned from my mistakes and just threw away what I stole out of guilt but what can you expect from teenagers.|`|ZK0uaSWeaa	What do you think this world needs?<br>  Do you think you can ever forget this?<br>  <br>  If I were you I would go the shopkeeper.

That's totally not kool. U should go back to the store and try to put them back. THEN take em to the cashier and pay for them like you should have. You'll feel better in the end and still have the cute headbands and wear them proud with feeling like you have 'thief' in Red letters on your forehead.|`|xqljgDHmaa	Take the headband that you stole and give it to Goodwill or Good Sam's....it will go to somebody else who needs or wants it but didn't steal it. <br>  Also, go in the store you stole from and buy something you DON"T need and pay for it to ease your guilt. Re-imburse the store somehow that way.|`|x2DweOpqaa	haha, don't even worry about it. even if they do see the security tapes, they can't see your face very well and they usually let you go your first time and don't say anything if you're clearly a teenager.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Repent or be condemned to eternal he!!
PtqN5WM3aa	Love the shoes and love the black and the blue.<br>  <br>  Black goes with more, but having all black shoes can be very boring. Not only that, but black shoes don't always look right with summery colored clothes. It looks drab and heavy and not in keeping with summer colors.<br>  <br>  I'd pick the blue and wear them with anything cream, white, yellow, lemon, pink, whatever colors you like. Remember, fashion runways always include clashing colors, like pink shoes and a green bag. As long as you have accessories that incorporate one of the clashing colors, you can't go wrong.<br>  <br>  For example, a cream dress, pink bag, blue shoes with pink and blue bangles will draw the whole outfit together.<br>  <br>  Don't be run of the mill and let your inner runway model out for the summer and most of all, HAVE FUN WITH CLOTHES!! xxx|`|kUhcypC9aa	Personally I do not like them but black is better :) x|`|lAHOyMnraa	definitely the blue ones, they are just more summery :D|`|xEUZC9udaa	Black would be better, since most outfits would match them! :)|`|aEGgO5Knaa	Id say black.

1HLHy8pXaa	andate in profumeria o in farmacia e chiedete dello smalto amaro per non mangiarsi le unghie. E' incolore, inodore, non tossico e asciuga in 30 secondi (davvero non come gli smalti della rimmel o simili!). In teoria con quello dovresti smettere ..ma non sempre è così io l'avevo già provato, ma se volevo togliere quell'angolino fastidioso..lo facevo anche se lo smalto faceva proprio schifo e non era solo amaro. Allora a cosa serve? Serve perchè se VOUI smettere con quello smalto ti accorgi per forza che ti stai mettendo le unghie in bocca..lo senti immediatamente e quindi lì fai perno sulla tua forza di volontà e non lo fai, usi la forbicina e poi devi diventare almeno per un po' di tempo maniaca delle unghie.. comprati un set manicure e impara ad usare tutti gli "aggeggi" dalla limetta (di cartone mi raccomando) a quella specie di bisturi per togliere le pellicine..in questo modo imparerai a fare più attenzione alle tue mani e non potrai non accorgerti se le stai mangiando.|`|1t569Wzoaa	ank'io prima le mangiavo ma ho smesso grazie ad uno smalto amaro ke si rikiede in farmacia.e' davvero forte cn me ha funzionato tu prova!|`|8SsiHgsoaa	Esiste un smalto ke ha un bruttissimo sapore è stato creato apposta x qst..

Rasserenati! Tuttavia, in attesa della serenità, applica una base indurente (per renderle meno sfaldabili), uno smalto di tuo gusto (che forse ti scoraggerà dal mangiarle!) o ricorri alle unghie finte che proteggeranno quelle vere (soluzione efficace ma costosa!).  Delle belle unghie sono innanzitutto delle unghie ben curate. Inutile mettere uno smalto bellissimo su unghie non preparate. Per approfittare di tutte le qualità dello smalto, del suo colore e della sua tenuta, bisogna assolutamente seguire alcune fasi preliminari. Lima regolarmente le unghie e soprattutto non usare mai il taglia unghie che tende a rigare l'unghia e a sfaldarla. Prima di mettere lo smalto applica un prodotto emolliente anti-cuticole.  Massaggia l'unghia per far penetrare bene il prodotto. Così le pellicine diventano morbide e si tolgono più facilmente. Il gesto di Ysaté, truccatrice presso Gemey : spalmare il prodotto su tutta l'unghia e attendere alcuni minuti. O usare un " trucco della nonna" : immergi le unghie per almeno tre minuti nell'acqua calda a cui avrai aggiunto qualche goccia di limone o d'olio d'oliva.<br>   Con un bastoncino d'arancio (è un legno molto tenero che perciò non provoca abrasioni) spingi indietro le cuticole. Per proteggere l'unghia, puoi anche avvolgere il bastoncino in un po' di cotone.  Procedi delicatamente, le cuticole scompaiono lasciando l'unghia più pulita e dai contorni ben definiti. Togli i residui con un po' di cotone : l'unghia è già luminosa. Con una pinzetta, togli solo le parti di pelle rimaste attaccate all'unghia. Massaggia e idrata mani e unghie con una crema nutriente.<br>   Astuzia da protagonista : leviga delicatamente l'unghia, un gesto essenziale per far splendere le unghie striate o opache. Per finire, pulisci l'interno dell'unghia con il bastoncino d'arancio.usa SEMPRE una base prima di applicare lo smalto, per nutrire e rinforzare l'unghia. L’applicazione della base si fa lentamente su tutta l'unghia. La scelta della base dipende dall'unghia e dai suoi problemi.

yBTGXdFwaa	Put your hands in really warm water and let them sit for a little. Then they should be able to be popped off. If that doesn't work, go to a nail salon and they can be removed by an employee there.|`|iXkgGhizaa	Here’s how it works<br>  ·Apply Vaseline on fingers and cuticles<br>  <br>  ·Take a bowl of acetone to soak your hands in it for a while. It’ better to use warm acetone than that at room temperature since it works faster on the nails. You can warm it by putting the acetone bowl in another bowl of hot water. Do not ever heat the acetone in a microwave or on the gas stove. Acetone is a highly inflammable chemical and can be quite hazardous.<br>  <br>  ·Cover the acetone bowl with a clean towel to avoid evaporation<br>  ·Keep the fingers in acetone for at least 15 minutes if it is warm and for about 30 minutes if it is at room temperature. Remember, the longer you keep it, the better since the acrylic will wear off easily and faster.<br>  ·Once the water becomes gummy, (which is the acrylic melting off), you can remove the rest of it by wiping it off with the towel dipped in acetone. Do not try to remove the acrylic before it is ready to peel off else it will begin to harden again and you will have to undergo the entire process again. An alternative method for acrylic nail removal is as under:|`|nt900cNIaa	ok, since you don't have any acetone use a nail clipper or cuticle nipper.  just clip the acrylic off. it can get painful but it's the only other way i know of without acetone

ed21623c8c2e89bbea50d192fee65b41aa	Celebrities get there eyebrows threaded it is up to the make up artists to fill in the gaps and make them tidier|`|WeOMih26aa	They pluck/wax them. They dye or lighten them. They brush them, gel them and trim them, shape them, and fill them (if your brows are not as full). Brow color is like eye shadow but a little more coarse so it resembles hair. Get it a shade lighter than your hair. Honestly they do everything! It just depends on your brows and what you need done to frame your face well. If you don't want to pay a lot, go to a beauty school in your area that has an athsetics program. It costs like 5 bucks for them to wax and shape your brows. If your scared about a student working on your eyebrows, then ask for a senior when you call for an  appointment. Good luck!
a1Ngi39Xaa	I drink lots and lots of water.  I try to eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  I also walk.<br>  <br>  Right now I am using mostly Mary Kay products on my face.  I have facial wash, an exfoliant with an after treatment, moisturizer, separate cream for around my eyes, lip mask with an exfoliant, lip moisturizer.  I also keep my hands and cuticles moisturized.  Try to keep the feet in shape too - use a scrub in the shower and a file on the callouses.<br>  <br>  I do facial masks at home about once a week.  I color my hair about every 5 weeks.  Get it cut every couple of months or so (it's long).<br>  <br>  I do a lot of tweezing...  eyebrows.  I also use a cream hair remover on my face.<br>  <br>  It's a pain being a gal sometimes, isn't it??<br>  <br>  Keep your clothes looking nice - get them pressed at a dry cleaners if you don't have time to iron them.  Get them altered to fit you perfectly if you can.  You don't have to have that many pieces in your wardrobe to make it work, but having the sleeves the right length, etc. really makes them look nice.  And get good shoes!   I always wear a watch, ring, bracelet, earrings and sometimes a necklace to match....|`|VIhj7ghUaa	I get a haircut and a beard trim every few months whether I need one or not.

I recently lost a lot of weight, went down from a size 18-20 to a size 10 so now taking care of myself is more fun! I got a pedicure for the first time in my life today, and I think I will get one every month from now on. I get my eyebrows waxed every time I get a haircut, which is about once every other month. I don't get a facial but like another girl said, I do mine at home. I don't recommend putting any kind of oil on your face though, especially if you have oily skin. I find the best facial in the world is rubbing egg white on your face and letting it dry, it tightens everything up. Then after about 30 minutes, run a bathroom sink full of hot water and put your face over it (not too close) and holding a towel draped over your head, so it steams. Then wash your face with a good mild cleanser, Neutrogena makes a good one, then rinse with cool water and pat dry. I do that about once a month. Follow it up with a good light moisturizer or some sunscreen if you're going outside.|`|9qbnbW9caa	ok well i dont think i can explain everything to u bt im 13 and ive got this down get ur haircut every 6 weeks if ur hair gorws fast like mine. facials (never got one) do it at home cheaper and works mix together oatmeal(grindend) and then some jojoba oil and tea tree oil and stuff u like like banna(mushed and water then put it on ur face for like 30 or 40 min. wash off fully. then uh then daily i take a 20 min. warmish shower wash ur face in there and ur whole body then shave ur legs in a bath another time and same with anything else u have to save lol and then uh lets see watch videos on youtube type in makeup and pick on one u like and u can get a little idea about it. lol goodluck|`|kW6vXLW3aa	i trim my hair every 2 months and after showers,i out on face moisturiser.i cut my nails when it gets kinda long but i only cut the top of it,dont cut it all the way down to the skin!|`|Vv465eJMaa	l have removed all mirrors in the house,so in my mind l am drop dead gorgeous without really knowing the reality|`|5AyoYsBkaa	I Update My Make Up Selection Monthly, And Moisturise Before Each Application Of Foundation, And Before I Go To Bed.

Green looks like food is stuck in your teeth. Also, make sure you dont get white or clear. They look good at first because they dont stand out, but after a week or so they get stained by food and turn an ugly yellow. <br>  <br>  It depends what you want. If you want to hide the braces more (this is what I do) I suggest silver because it blends in with the bracket and it doesnt stain. <br>  <br>  If you want to be more funky with color then I suggest light blue (because there isnt a light blue food: also it will go nicely iwth your eyes) and either pink (to set off your skin) or black (goes with your hair!)<br>  <br>  Good Luck choosing!

You are really cute!  I totally don't think you should change a thing.  If you are looking to do something to cheer you up and give you a bit more confidence then you should maybe go for a sweeping fringe and then have a bit of a play with clothes and make up.  You seem to have your own style which is great and VERY important so play away!|`|RShi5KUmaa	you're definitely not ugly.  All you really need is some black eyeliner (not too heavy), eyeshadow, and some lipstick.  Just go to a makeup counter at a dept store and get a makeover and they'll tell you what colors you should get|`|7021a4d436eb35c4dcdfe0a825a310afaa	U Are So pretty(u remind me of vicky beckham)<br>  i agree with kate<br>  you should try sum lip gloss, eyeliner and mascara and && i love tha hair dont cut it or color it but try out sum new styles for longer hair k<br>  -peace|`|6tzT8GFqaa	you are wel fit i would be all over you if i knew you! lol<br>  <br>  xxxx|`|YIzuVcIcaa	ur kidding me right? u are like so amazingly beautiful! if we were alowed to rate you id give you atleast a 9.5. but were nopt, so i wont. Your bangs are full and have volume. Most girls who get bangs have wispy little strings infront of their faces, but yours look so great. You hair color is beautiful. You are tann. And you have an adorable beauty mark, which is sooo increadably cute. <br>  <br>  Maybe you could try curling your hair. Pinning back your bangs, if ur self concious about them. Wearing light makeup like a tiny bit of mascara and lip gloss (but ur soooo natuarly beautiful) Plus your skin looks oil free, and you have like no acne. WOW. and u think your ugly?? your lips are big and full, (angelina jolie) add a bit of lip gloss and that could be one of your best features!!! wow i can't beleive u think your ugly:)|`|8ZVrAl2Zaa	You are okay looking. I think that that freckle just kinda makes you look bad. Cover it up with lipstick or something. : ) Red lipstick would suit you. And I think all you need is a little bit of eyeliner under your eyes. I think you would look good after.|`|n0aPurUpaa	ur pretty (=<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuRYz5kaEYynMLWEvoOreDgazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307113403AAyiAVH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8a9HQQUGaa	you are totally hot hun i have already told you before<br>  do i really need to tell you again!|`|KkVUPatCaa	Wear more makeup?<br>  <br>   But I already think you are VERY pretty:)
tqYpkDyEaa	Alright:<br>  <br>  Eyes:  I would recommend a gold-brown eyeshadow.  I would also wear a black mascara, if you have it handy.  Another thing I would do is also apply the black eyeliner LIGHTLY along the bottom of the eyelid, but also apply it on the top of the eyelid, to give the illusion of thicker lashes.<br>  <br>  Lips:  Chapstick, chapstick, chapstick.  I highly recommend Carmex, it makes your lips smooth and soft.  If you don't have that with you, or don't want to go to your local drugstore to find it, then just use any chapstick!  Lipgloss is really shiny and distracts people from other parts of your face.  Plus, its super gloppy.  Ick.<br>  <br>  Face:  Hm, have you ever used blush?  A super-light rose shade would look great with your pale skin.  Apply to the apples of your cheeks!<br>  <br>  Clothes:  I would definitely go with the navy blue converse and skinny jeans.  If you end up going with the flare jeans, though, try rolling them once (only if it doesn't make them too short!).  But, yeah, skinny jeans and converse are love!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|HyxRTdjdaa	ur black ug knock offs! and wear like a whiteish shirt with a cute long knecklace or something like that or something simple! and the jeans should be skinny jeans! and for makeup, put something natural or whatever ur wearing that day whatever color matches!|`|0G1fOjpWaa	uggs are nasty...converse....classic....any jeans will do...consider very dark brown eyeliner rather than black though...it will look better....|`|s5y6SZhnaa	Play it safe in the converse all-stars. I like the skinny jeans. Wear a fitting white Tee. IF you have pale skin, and you wear blush, USE BENE-TINT BY BENEFIT! it smells like roses, it is liquid, it is non oily, and it looks darling on pale girls. go with an innocent, rosy look, but stick with your black eyeliner. never dye your hair.
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Ugh.  Those always make people look creepy though because something about them just doesn't look real.  Just leave your eyes alone.  You're lucky enough to have both green and brown in them so it would be very easy for you to either change the makeup colors you wear or change your hair color to make your eyes appear a different shade by comparison.  My old roommate used to do this, she had eyes similar to yours.  When she had mousy brown hair, her eyes looked yellow.  When she died it a reddish tinge they looked green, and when she died it blonde they looked browner.  When she had very dark hair, her eyes just looked all sorts of color.|`|0AXgXFpraa	get green or better yet BLUE!<br>  i wanna do the same :)<br>  answer mine plz ?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmqR4kxcfd9khY4ToYz6ioPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307124324AA0yedK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LoLx0szUaa	ocean blue contacts or gray contacts (: <br>  <br>  ocean blue contacts: <a href="http://www.colormycontacts.com/Images/acuvueenhancers-blue.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.colormycontacts.com/Images/ac...</a><br>  Gray contacts: <a href="http://www.argoth.co.uk/acatalog/fezGreycolour.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.argoth.co.uk/acatalog/fezGrey...</a>|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	bright blue!<br>  like this...<br>  <a href="http://mikedixonphotography.net/livcol04.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://mikedixonphotography.net/livcol04...</a><br>  that would look so amazing on you!<br>  have fun!|`|Q2mvlydOaa	your eyes are pretty<br>  but if u really want to change,<br>  try blue it would look nice with your hair|`|Qt3QIc7baa	emerald green or blue|`|ChTvHQdmaa	If You Want A Big Change an Icey Blue.

5Jvw2l7raa	Hello there,<br>  I have been using Kiss Careless as a lip balm for some time now and it is excellent. As soon as you apply it you can feel it moisturising straight away. Also, you don't need to apply lots for it to work you only need to do one stroke and that's enough. You can probably find it anywhere. I find it works great. Hope this helps.<br>       Ah lip gloss, I find Rimmel London lip gloss is great. There are numerous shades that are just amazing. The lip gloss shades also have matching lipsticks which is a great combination. Also, there not only different shades of colour but they are clear as well. They don't have small glittery bits in, well some do but the clear ones are crystal clear and work greatly.<br>        I hope this answers your question.<br>  Natalie x<br>  P.s: If you need anymore advice then email me at:<br>  collinsonnatalie@yahoo.com|`|WeOMih26aa	Bertsbees. That's all I have to say ha ha. It's amazing! It's long wearing and they even have it in tinted colors that are amazing. I live in Utah so I'm the same way. Trust me, this is good stuff. As far as lip gloss, I use mac and absolutely love it! It's very creamy and makes your lips feel so good! Plus the shades are amazing! Good luck!|`|63aJxVjqaa	Palmer's Cocoa Butter Dark Chocolate & Peppermint lip butter. It goes on so smooth and rich, but not goopy or waxy. It moisturizes great, makes lips silky! And the smell is so decadent. It adds a slight sheen as well. Wonderful product, trust me, I'm a lip products junkie!!!!|`|lr7DZSFqaa	burt's bee is good! i had a bad cut on my lip so i used burt's bee and the cut was healed the next day|`|kIbReU80aa	i live in texas its hot here too but i use Alba! it's a good lip gloos and chapstick brand!|`|2BjpRnL0aa	CARMEX !|`|fYox2mwGaa	I just bought some tubes of Carmex... they make it now where it looks like a little lipstick tube.  I really like it... my lips get a little dry from time to time because of my longwear lipstick (only in winter) and I use that to prevent further chapping and peeling.  That's all I use...

Hope my answer was helpful?|`|rOj4B5QNaa	I have both wrists, both sides, chest and upper arm.  Most painful getting it was my ribs, however most painful healing was my chest.

y4SUDnpaaa	My Dear Sir, do you mean to infer that the ombudsman has not yet contacted you .......... leaving you to ponder the question of whether or not you should call him? The wretch! The ombudsman, were  he  carrying out his duties,  would have known of this dreadful incident and  settled it before you became aware something was amiss. Now this situation has been flung into your honorable lap.    I dare say he should have known of it beforehand.   Has he forgotten your leisure is not to be disturbed over trifling events?  This scurly Ombudsman surely is not overly worked. What need would the lower classes have for his services? Don't they solve their piteous problems with bludgeons, knives and such?   I trust the ombudsman will be duly chastised. I feel certain your trusted Manservant can devise some sort of torture devise. As for the damnable trousers, the firm at fault should be sending the finest Italian tailor to your mansion, post haste, to furnish you with an entire new smashing wardrobe as we  speak........or type as it were. May I be so bold as to ask where your personal tailor, Guido, was when this madness was happening? I'm in fear all this distress in one day will sour your recent wave of goodwill to your servants.

To me, I think it all depends on what they give you(length, volume, etc).<br>  But I've heard that Volumniuos and the XXL one is really good.<br>  But Great Lash, many people say it clumps and flakes.=P|`|3fa42e1d5f13f37e2ec069fe32521d2caa	Personally, I have found that the cheap ones work the same as the expensive (Lancome at $20 a tube) ones!|`|nbR8z1OQaa	I have used both department store and drugstore mascaras.<br>  Lancome has been a favorite of mine, but honestly, I found the cheap Maybelline full n soft to be a great value!

But I prefer Rimmel London lip gloss. I have tried a combination of them and I find they work great. They don't have the tingling feeling which is good because I for one do not like the feeling of a tingling lip gloss. They also have a combination of shades too. And to make things better they have shades of colour lip gloss or clear glosses. I find clear lip glosses look good with natural lips. They also have matching lipsticks. The shade of lipstick matches the shade of lip gloss so it is a great combination of colours.<br>  I hope this answers your question.<br>  Natalie x<br>  P.s: If you would like anymore advice then email me at:<br>  collinsonnatalie@yahoo.com|`|yIRcd5X8aa	NYC lipcolor|`|HyxRTdjdaa	the bath and body works one<br>  orr<br>  victoria secret!

T2DIK775aa	IL FUMO NON AIUTA IN NESSUN CASO.<br>  <br>  é vero peró che ha un certo influenza sul peso corporeo. La nicotina funziona come "narcotizzante" al centro nervoso che regola l'appetito nel cervello, diminuendo cosí la sensazione di fame o di appetito, e accellera leggermente il metabolismo cosí che vengono bruciati piú grassi. Per molti la sigaretta dopo i pasti ha una leggera funzione "purgante"..<br>  MA QUELLO CHE SI Fá AI POLMONI??<br>  Le circa 200calorie che si riescono a bruciare al giorno attraverso il fumo, puoi consumarle tranquillamente anche attraverso un pó di sport, che ne só, in un Fitness Center o all'aria aperta..con due piacevoli effetti: risparmi soldini,e un buon work-out  calma i nervi, distrae e diverte, diminuendo cosí la voglia di accenderne una.<br>  Ma siccome non sono né ipocrita, né santarella, ti dico che questa predica viene da un "pulpito" che fuma da vent'anni.<br>  Ti posso solo consigliare di non fare lo stesso mio errore.|`|6nmlVOkCaa	Sì è vero aiuta a bruciare più in fretta e poi fà anche male alla pelle può far venire tumori all'epidermide..<br>  <br>  baci..|`|TLAxqkGVaa	no veramente il fumo non brucia i grassi...ma in realtà sarebbe che invece di mangiare ad esempio un pezzo di cioccolata perkè ti viene voglia,fumando non ci pensi|`|Tlme47bfaa	non è affatto vero|`|U3GLEM6maa	Sembra in realtà che non brucia grassi ma accellera leggermente il metabolismo basale di circa il 10%. Quindi in condizione di riposo il corpo di un fumatore dovrebbe bruciare di più rispetto a quello di un non fumatore. Qualcuno dice che questo maggior dispendio avviene perchè il corpo del fumatore impiega più risorse per tentare di riparare i danni del fumo.<br>  In alternativa si può pensare ad una falsa credenza: conosco tanti ex-fumatori che una volta smesso sono ingrassati anche parecchio. Questo dimostra che il fumo "brucia"? Anche no dato che di solito i fumatori che vogliono smettere per compensare la mancanza della sigaretta tendono ad ingurgitare tutto quello che capita per una sorta di fame psicologica. Per questo ingrassano.|`|aEDlwMg8aa	Cazzate! Non fumare, te lo dice uno strzo che fuma di 20 anni.|`|enTV6zktaa	assolutamente no. Chi fuma tende a dimagrire xche piano piano i 'recettori' del gusto che ci sono sulla lingua funzionano sempre meno e quindi il fumatore tende a sentire meno il sapore del cibo e a mangiare meno... comunque è un processo molto lento...|`|pnjNkNwdaa	non è per niente vero...leggi: <br>  <br>  La nicotina fa diminuire l’appetito? Una leggenda, secondo uno studio pubblicato sulla rivista Psychopharmacology, che dimostra che l’assunzione di nicotina aumenta lo stimolo a cercare il cibo, un effetto che perdura per settimane anche se l’assunzione di nicotina viene interrotta.<br>  <br>  Lo studio sembra spazzare via un pregiudizio che rappresenta da sempre uno degli ostacoli più diffusi per chi decide di smettere di fumare, specialmente se si tratta di donne: quello che l’assunzione di nicotina faccia dimagrire, e che quindi di conseguenza smettere di fumare significhi automaticamente un aumento di peso corporeo. “Sebbene la nicotina possa agire come soppressore dell’appetito, questi sono i primi dati che suggeriscono che la ripetuta esposizione alla nicotina fa aumentare la motivazione per la ricerca del cibo per settimane”, spiega Darlene Brunzell, ricercatrice del Department of Psychiatry della Yale University.<br>  <br>   “Questa ricerca ci fa capire che quando i giovani iniziano a fumare con l’illusione di regolare il loro peso corporeo il più delle volte ottengono il risultato contrario, oltre a danneggiare gravemente la loro salute”, aggiunge Stephanie O’Malley, professore di Psichiatria e ricercatrice per il Center for Nicotine & Tobacco Use Research della Yale University. “|`|pwIsceoPaa	Per alcuni il fumo, alterando il funzionamento delle ghiandole linfatiche che agiscono sul metabolismo basale, crea un autentica debilitazione per tutto l' organismo. L' organismo, alfine di recuperare alcune energie, brucia dei grassi in eccesso. Quindi, alcune persone, smettendo di fumare possono ingrassare. Questo fenomeno però, non é da ritenersi negativo per questi corpi, se non da un punto di vista estetico. Una dieta appropriata ed un riequilibrio dei minerali, impedisce questo fenomeno e riporta il corpo ad una giovinezza ed una linea mai provata.|`|383a190241ec669ba859ab36f6faa855aa	Mai sentito dire una cosa del genere.. in caso fosse vero è più evidente il danno che provoca il fumo che i grassi che brucia..<br>  purtroppo invecchia anche la pelle..<br>  e chi ti parla AHIME è una fumatrice.|`|8165f8b5e1c26fb3f132e725b82d2c43aa	La nicotina aumenta leggermente la velocità del metabolismo basale.Toglie anke il senso di fame.Però non conviene visto ke provoca un sacco di tipi di tumori che possono anke essere mortali.Primo fra tutti il carcinoma al polmone...|`|NVGh0tgyaa	no,non è vero,e tanto meno fa bene alla pelle,anzi!! Il fatto che spesso le donne fumatrici siano magre è dovuto al fatto che un peccato di gola viene sostituito dalla sigaretta,se ci pensi sta tutto nel gesto,è sempre un qualcosa che si porta alla bocca,e che in qualche modo..si gusta!|`|aBMeXvGsaa	assolutamente non è vero..e fa molto male alla pelle!|`|t4G79eFwaa	si..aiuta a bruciare più in fretta i polmoni...

QrJBg2Draa	well what eye color do you have? usually people choose their eye makeup by their eye color so if you have blue eyes you want to wear browns and greens. brown eyes greens and pinks. pretty much you just want to have colors that are opposite of your eye color hope this helps =]|`|il7bLkSIaa	I would do the eyeliner with the eyeshadow... I used to do that in highschool and wear a tonnn of make-up because I felt naked without it... and then I tried just the eyeliner on the top to make my lashes look thicker...a bit of bronzer, and lip gloss...and I looked sooo much more sexy!!<br>  <br>  I cringe when I look at old pictures of my friends and I in highschool wearing all this make-up when it looks horrible and non of us need it. <br>  <br>  If you wanna do eyeshadow, do it without the liner. Maybe a shiney yellow or purple. Go to MAC they have every color in the world and Im sure the girls who work there can help you!!|`|RZKygoPzaa	Hi, I'm a redhead too and was a professional model for many years.  In addition, both my grandmothers were natural redheads.  So enough about me.  <br>  <br>  Don't know your eye color, but I would suggest a dark brown shade of eye pencil for every day.  One by Lancome from their  LE CRAYON KHOL group, color is 'Black Coffee'  is particully good and is a staple in my makeup case.  Dark Grey is another good neutral eyeliner.  Other good choices I think are anything that is subtle but gives deffiniton.  I like a soft, dark, subtle plum or forest green, not neon, but smoky.  Most of these are by Lancome, but other cosmetic companys have there version I am sure.  You can always go into a department store makeup counter and look around, just because one of those make up sales people do not talk you into anything you don't want. Pick a high end brand, like Chanel or Lancome, you do not have to buy anything when they are done.   Is there a SEPHORA store in a mall near you or a Merle Norman?  SEPHORA is more cutting edge, Merle Norman is a little bland for my taste. <br>  <br>  Let an experienced sales person who looks good herself, do a make-over on you.  Again, you are not obligated to buy anything, make sure that is established. Now-a-days some of them want you to sign up for a seminar and have you plunk down between $25.00 to $50.00 up front for a reservation to the alleged Make-Up Seminar.  They tell you that you can use the registration money towards a purchase.  Take a pass on those, go for the no obigation make-up session.  <br>  <br>  I would further sugest tht you NOT  go on a Saturday or a day where there are a lot of people in the store; you will not get the attention.  Rather, go on a Monday during the day, or afternoon or evening, you will get better attention.  <br>  <br>  I do not know if you are aware of this, but cosmetic sales people are required by large department stores to bring in a cetain amount of money.  When they are interviewed for the job they are asked if they are able to do this, the department sotres want a guarantee in writng from them.  They make them sign an agreement and their job depends on it.  <br>  <br>  Cosmetic Sales perople work for the department store and for the vendor (cosmetic company they represent).  They are sent to seminars to learn their trade and sales techniques to sell cosmetics. The focus is geared on making large sales quotas.  They sign an agreement that they will generate so many dollars in sales per week, per month, per season and per year.  Most of them do very well at Christmas time, Mothers Day, Valentines Day, or when they have one of those 'special offer.'  If you buy someting you get something for free or at a lesser amount that its value. I'm sure you have seen this advetised on TV and in sundy newpaper magazine secitons.  <br>  <br>  They're objective is to get you to buy more than you set out to.  Even if you were not even looking to buy cosmetics, they have techniques for reeling you in like a fish.  They are very friendly and conversational. They will tell you  that you need these things and that you look great in whatever they have applied to your face.  Most of the time its the 'new high-end product' they are promoting this month and they are required to sell so many units of it.  They have sales associate competitioons and the winner gets a prize from the department store and from the cosmetic company. You are a fish to them, they are fishermen.   Its not a bad thing, just so you are aware of what is going on.<br>  <br>  You might find somethng to buy, who knows, just don't spend the mortgage money.  Most of these cosmetics can be closely duplicated at the drugstore for far less. Remember, you are going for ideas and new concepts that you can duplicate at a lesser price, so you can have more money to spend on somethng that cannot be duplicatd at a lower price.  Like a dress or something else.  <br>  <br>  Technique and Application are part of it all this too.  If you do a makeover, watch what cosmotician or sales person is doing to you.  If you can't see what she or he is doing, then ask questions.  Don't just sink into a hypnotic state, you won't learn anythng that way. <br>  <br>  Have fun and if you dont' see anything you like, walk.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|jL0Y27g2aa	try an olive but very light and champagne colours maybe even a light grey <br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.ca/templates/products/sp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY15103&PRODUCT_ID=PROD1503" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.ca/templates/pro...</a><br>  Colours: Juxt,Gorgeous Gold,Ricepaper,Henna,Goldmine,Mylar, Patina|`|GDf2n7jPaa	Am something in the colour copper eyes or a grey or silver eyeshadow or else a golden colour eye shadow.Am how about grey eyeliner or brown.anything im sure will look pretty with your hair colour xxxxx|`|93zL6EIYaa	um browns and brownnish reds are good... um <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.realmofredheads.net/mt/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realmofredheads.net/mt/</a>|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	do not ware blue or green!|`|vgkN0YETaa	i think personally that you should use colors!

Good luck!|`|81ff98a2b59a7150ffd94a3f4604b9e1aa	Dark brown eyes are gorgeous, and because they are so dark, they act as a neutral, so you have a lot of freedom in choosing makeup colors.  <br>  <br>  Blue are opposite the color wheel from brown (which is what you get if you mix black with orange, blue's natural complement).  So if you want your eyes to pop, try a blue that is becoming on you.  That will depend on your skin tone to some degree, and even though you mention being tan, every skin tone has undertones that determine which colors are the most flattering on you.  Some have more blue undertones, and some have more yellow undertones.  <br>  <br>  If your skin looks the most harmonious with gold jewelry and yellow-tinged reds, you will look best in the warmer shades of any color, which means any color with some yellow added to it, pretty much.  <br>  Lime better than Forest green, Aqua better than blue-violet, tomato red better than burgundy, and so on.  <br>  <br>  If you look better in silver jewelry and burgundy or pink, then the second color in each pair in the previous section would be more becoming.  <br>  <br>  Also, some people look better in colors that are clear, and others look better in colors that are more muted.  <br>  <br>  The original color scheme made popular in the book "Color Me Beautiful" were these: <br>  <br>  Spring - warm, clear colors like yellow, orange, warm red, light camel, cream<br>  Summer - cool, slightly muted and pastels like blue, pink, rose, forest green, gray, taupe (a gray-beige), no black. And just say no to orange, though pale, pale peach might be ok. <br>  Autumn - warm and slightly dulled shades like mustard, gold, tomato, rust, chocolate, only blues with lots of green in it, like peacock and teal. <br>  Winter - sharp, clear, cool, jewel tones, black and white. <br>  <br>  Another author, name forgotten, did a book with white, black, asian and hispanic women, dividing each type into categories.  The way she divided up each type was a little bit different, though the section on white women was an expanded version of Color Me Beautiful, and she described women as being high or low contrast combined with being cool or warm, and did a better job of handling women who were somewhere between the 4 basic types.  <br>  <br>  If you have high contrast between your eyes/hair and skin or hair/eyes and the whites of your eyes and teeth, you might want to start with the rich, deep colors, both warm and cool, to see which ones look best on you, because statistically, you probably fall in that category...but not necessarily.  You gotta try the colors on YOU. <br>  <br>  In general, you will look more naturally beautiful if you keep your makeup tones in colors that coordinate with your skin...<br>  <br>  Some lucky people with dark hair and brown eyes fall somewhere in the middle and look great in either side of the spectrum.  <br>  <br>  This is hard to answer without seeing you in person.  Try a color consultant and/or get together with some friends and a bunch of pieces of fabric/clothing in different colors, some good light, a big mirror.  Then hold things up to your face and look at your face and eyes to see which colors tend to make you look more alive and healthy, and which seem too harsh or too dull on you.  If you love a color that doesn't look great on you, simply wear it further from your face, like in a skirt or shoe or bag - you can enjoy the color without giving your skin a less-than-beautiful setting.|`|oO4gr7LWaa	try using almay.<br>  they have make-up for all different types of eye color hair color skin color etc. its right on the case of the make up like brown will highlight blue eyes and what not. check it out. :]|`|lyuWTIo6aa	same here you can wear colored contacts...or try covergirls exact eyelights..that make your eyes brighter..rhianna uses it..or take brown linear and smear it on the bottom/a little on top brings out the brown..but you would deff look good wearing yellow or navy!|`|6awUNCDzaa	Same =]<br>  I wear lots of purples, blues, pinks, and light yellows.<br>  As for makeup I use natural peachy tones or light purples for eyeshadow and black eyeliner and mascara|`|vWMNXNLraa	omg im tht tooo!!!!<br>  haha i get excited for the littlest things <br>  <br>  bronze or gold colors and purple too =]<br>  <br>  hope tht helped<br>  <br>  how awesome is it tht were the same lol|`|dM1Ot2APaa	Haha same here!!!<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Green and orange and yellow make us look really good.<br>  <br>  but i prefer black and blues too.<br>  <br>  :)|`|jrtog7rUaa	If your tan then go with colors like gold and yellow and white for eye shadow|`|ky9uJSHPaa	hmm. definitely green, and purple. it kind of depends what shades.<br>  but brown wouldn't look too good (i'm indian/tan skin/black hair/hazel eyes) and brown isn't one of the best colors.<br>  <br>  but dark pinks, light/dark blues, greens, purples, etc.<br>  yellow and gold can also look nice. <br>  <br>  =)|`|Ma20EGgoaa	well dark eyes are beautiful in my source! i have them 2! and i also have dark brown hair and im also tan. and i would think u look gorgeous!|`|yLPZ7gkkaa	haa same.<br>  i hate having dark eyes. i feel like no one see's them<br>  i want those honeybrown eyes.

7tRTZhnLaa	It is good at first but after awhile your skin gets use to it and it doesn't work anymore.|`|GItWq2mGaa	After fighting with the hand held wave power cleanser/massager in an attempt to install the battery (it was almost like trying to remove a "child proof cap" from a prescription bottle)I prepared for my first use of the item.<br>  <br>  My observations are as follows:<br>  1. The pads do not really "suds up" and left me wondering if there was actually any product in them.<br>  2. The vibrating "massage" was pleasant enough and obviously was doing something to my skin since after the second use I noticed a breakout of a few small "pimples".(Could it be that it cleansed impurities in my pores and brought them to the surface?).<br>  3. After a week of use the pimples cleared up and my skin did appear to have a more refined look.<br>  <br>  Overall I would say that the product does perform as advertised. It is a "Power Cleanser". Do not expect that it will diminish your wrinkles or make you look like you've had professional skin resurfacing. What you do get using the power wave is a healthy glow from the stimulation the massager provides and a clean face. (What more could a gal ask for??)|`|aY2KrGmyaa	the first time i used it, it was great. but after that it just made my face red and itchy.. not worth the moneyy. it doesnt even foam up like it shows. just like rubbing wet cotton on your face.<br>  <br>  >/|`|6t191pnJaa	i honestly dont think its worth the money. i have it and it just makes my face pinkish red. and sometimes irritated.
GItWq2mGaa	*  Don?t over do it. The first rule of applying eye shadow is not to over do the amount that you apply. You want a great look for your eyes but you do not want to turn into an old lady with layers of eye shadow on your eyes. Instead, go for a minimal look and it will pay off with an amazing look.<br>      * Dark or light? There are many ways in which to apply your eye shadow. Most will apply a darker shade of eye shadow to the area right above the eyelashes. Then, right under the eyebrow, apply a lighter color. You can mix and match the colors that fit with your tastes. You can even apply a thin layer of a darker eye shadow under the eye right next to your lower eyelashes. This will give a more dramatic look.<br>      * Balance with your eye color. Another tip to selecting the right eye shadow is to select an eye shadow that works well with your eye color. If you have a light colored eye, make sure that you apply a light colored eye shadow to your eye. If your eyes are darker, a darker look will work well. You can define the color of your eye more so with the use of eye shadow if you balance the colors in this way.<br>      * For a formal look, add a bit of glamour. To do this, just use a shimmering type of eye shadow. Make sure that you have the best colors that will match what you are wearing as well as what your makeup looks like. A bit of shine makes everyone dazzle.<br>  <br>  Eye shadow does not have to be overwhelming and ugly! It can be quite beautiful and the perfect way to add a lot of fun and glamour to your look. Apply it right and you will benefit every time. <br>  <br>  Brown eyes look great in blue and pink tones as well as golds and burnt oranges. The intensity of color you wear depends on your skin tone. For fair skin, use a soft blue on the eylid, plum on the outer edge of the eye, and pink under the eyebrow. For medium to deeper skin tone, the plum could be used on the lid and into the crease area. Line eyes with a navy or plum color and black mascara.|`|0AXgXFpraa	try purple it always looks awesome !<br>  and just put it on the top lid carefully, not fast cuz it can go everywhere.<br>  try youtube :)<br>  answer mine ?!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmqR4kxcfd9khY4ToYz6ioPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307124324AA0yedK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZpefK0sgaa	<a href="http://bsu.edu/web/spectrum/eye%20makeup.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bsu.edu/web/spectrum/eye%20makeup...</a><br>  this also works if you change the shadow color..<br>  brown eyes r pretty but shadows look different depending on skin color also so just go to a makeup store like mac or sephore play w/ color && try different shades<br>  then if you find a good one go to like walmart, target or like walgreens and pick a cheaper kind like mabelliene or covergirl<br>  hope that helped =]|`|6t191pnJaa	i dont really know a website but i can tell you how. :)<br>  ok well you really just rub your finger (a finger works better than a eyeshadow brush) on the eyeshadow and then rub your finger on the top of your eye lid.  :) and i think dark blue, light green or white looks best on brown eyes.  :D|`|bthUZouFaa	brown eyes....ANY COLOR!!!....look at you tube

(But, you really don't need makeup)<br>  And, i'll say it again. You're not ugly. Anyone who says that to you obviously is trying to tease you because some people are just idiots like that. Most girls that say stuff like that have problems with their own self image or are just too full of themselves. Boys... well, most boys who say stuff like that are just idiots.<br>  (I had the same problem a few years ago when i was in middle school)<br>  so, ignore any bad comments, and try out a new hairstyle and some light makeup if you really think you need it (but, honestly, you don't)<br>  hopes this helped :)|`|3NItfUj9aa	Your not ugly your cute.

This is the most popular and common form of perfume. It provides a long-lasting fragrance and generally doesn't cost as much as extract perfume.<br>  <br>  Eau de toilette has around 1-6% perfume concentrates. This makes for a light scent that doesn't linger as long as the more intense versions. It was originally intended to be a refreshing body splash to help people wake up in the morning.<br>  <br>  so go to your local shop and find a scent you love that makes you feel sexy and wear it confidently :)|`|1mHRVG5Jaa	Britney Spears - Fantasy Midnight, <br>  lush :) x|`|qzo6zO64aa	Nina ricci or Christian Dior or Marc Jacobs daisy.

0bYcYz2jaa	Getting hit in the chest won't affect your growth or shrink your chest size.  However, if you are consistently getting hit, it may cause the tissue to harden almost like a callus.  But that would take a lot of hits to the same exact spot so it's not likely.|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	nope|`|7UfuqGmcaa	Hit in the chest...does that mean something hit you accidentally in the chest?<br>  <br>  If so, then, no.

0dbASWe5aa	I highly recommend Jergens Natural Glow moisturizer and lotion.  It gradually makes your skin darker, but it never looks orange or fake.  (Trust me, I have very fair skin, but already look tanner after two weeks.)|`|hAkeSmleaa	Try a bronzer. Benefit bronzer (its called Hula) works really well. or get a foundation that it a little darker then your skin tone. if you want your entire body to be tan try tanning lotion..if you want to use tanning lotion for your face get one spicificially just for faces.  If you use body tanning lotion on your face and neck it will get blotchy..even if your really carefull. take  my word for it|`|f49a40a8fa81688fd194b82dec47fcfcaa	ima not judging you er anything...but why cant you just be glad the way you are?!<br>  <br>  <br>  if yah wanna be tanner, go buy a spray on tanner  at the store or go to a tanning salon if theres one where you live?!<br>  <br>  (:
5bg0hEQIaa	ALL foundations no matter how expensive or cheap will clog your pores...IF you do not take it off properly. Even "Bare Minerals" will clog your pores. You must take off ALL makeup (foundation) with a wipe (I use MAC's wipes). Then, you clease, tone, and MOISTURIZE your face!! Get a good moisturizer like MAC's Studio Fix. Now, just because I am naming a lot of MAC products doesn't mean I use MAC foundation, actually I don't really like it.<br>  <br>  Remember to EXFOLIATE at least 2-3 times per week.<br>  <br>  THANKS!|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	DONT wear makeup- i had perfect skin when i was thirteen and then i started wearing makeup-i have really bad acne now! if i were you i just wouldnt wear it at all!|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	I personally love everyday minerals.

AA10797214	Yes, specially the blue green eye color does change, I am not sure just what causes the change, I sometimes think it may be a reflection of the colors I am  wearing, a green polo will make the eyes a more stronger and vivid green. Yes human eyes change color, and there are human eyes where on eye is brown while the other is blue, it is surprising when you see it, It looks as if it is another person when you see the other side of the profile.

It's far more likely that you eye colour is reacting to some factor (or combination) or lighting, colours that you are wearing (close to your face), emotion etc.  My eye colour changes for all of the above factors.  I have friends whose eye colours change radically whenever they're in a particular mood.  For medical information, you could try AMA.com|`|LNSiLxlBaa	I think eye color can change.

Why are you still using these products? If something brings you out in spots and you stop using it and they disappear - then don't use it again!<br>  <br>  It may be that you're allergic to some ingredient in the products you've been using, or just that you've been putting too much stuff on your face altogether.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old you are, but I've found that one of the best products is simple Aqueous Cream, which you can buy over the counter at your pharmacist or supermarket pharmacy, and is suitable for any age.  This works as a cleanser and moisturiser and costs very little.  I've been using it for years and have perfect skin (I'm 62) and have just been reading in the news that it's becoming very popular because it's been proved to be just as good as hugely expensive skin creams.<br>  <br>  The best skin cream is the simplest; if something smells really nice, the perfume could be what is upsetting your skin (perfume ingredients are renowned for causing allergies).|`|JERUmEFzaa	You may be allergic to them. In my opinion stop using the products and tell your doctor about it.

zlXofrG4aa	Bare Minerals!  All the way.  You need to condition your skin to not produce so much oil.  Wash your face twice a day, start with luke warm water, exfoliate with a mild beaded wash, switch it up once and a while with a face masque or astringent, and always end with cold water!  Warm/Hot water makes the skin produce oil, so you need to use cold water.  Also before applying the makeup you need to put a facial lotion on.  That sounds stupid because your face is so oily but it shows your face, over time, not right away, that it doesn't need to make so much oil anymore.  That you'll be providing your skin with a lotion and after a while your face won't produce as much oil.  Then after the lotion put on bare minerals.  Bare minerals is so great and it covers so well.  That's what I use and I have oily skin as well.  Hope this helped!|`|37WQ3LKFaa	Hi! Um I have the oiliest skin you could have. OMG. um I love using bare minerals.

yoVc9QWEaa	First of all you need to understand the type of skin you have and use the make up that best suites your skin colour. It is extremely important that you wash your face clean, tone and mosturize before you apply the make up base. If the colour of the make up is not a problem, then use an eye shadow with high light reflect, with a little shimmer. Dont use matt make up, try and use the mineral make up. They stay on for a long time and look extremely natural. But dont forget the pre make regime. Its important. Take good care of ur skin generally as well. Avoid wearing make up wen not necessary. All the best.|`|SNCeFeY1aa	probably you're not putting enough on or that make up isnt the right color for your skin. try just putting it on a bit darker, or try a totally different color.|`|i01egybJaa	Get a darker color of eyeshadow|`|oGOfioR7aa	Try a different, more pigmented eyeshadow. If you're using a cheap, sheer color then its more likely not to show up. For a base try Too Faced Shadow Insurance. Also, make sure you use a good brush. Depending on the shadow, it might need to be blended out, or sort of "packed on". Good luck!|`|nbR8z1OQaa	try using an eyeshadow primer. or maybe its the eyeshadow your using. Try getting a good pigmented shadow. and use the foiling technique. Where you use it slightly damp, then go over it dry.|`|vd2ExGEraa	its probably to light or you dont rub it off onto the utensil hard enough, get a darker shade|`|8jY4JUw7aa	try using a moisturizer first|`|xgYA00muaa	Well it could be cause you have oily or gresy skin that it just sinks in and isnt noticeable. Or you could just not be putting enough on!<br>  My best friend has a powder foundation that she puts on and cant tell the difference so maybe you just need to buy a better product or one more suitable.<br>  Eyeshadow could not be showing up because it is too fair on your skin and isnt bright enough to be a ble to see, Or you could have quite deep eyes and it settles on your eyelid which is quite deep into your face, there for making your eyelid less visble than your brow and eye!<br>  Maybe you should go into Boots and have one of thoses free trial makeovers (at least i think there free) they will be able to tell you what colours you suit, be able to advise products that are good on you and on where you have been going wrong.<br>  Boots is in U.K by the way so i don't know if they do this in american shops if your american.<br>  Hope this helped.|`|doha66YWaa	Use more.<br>  Seriously, get the brush and swirl it round 3 times<br>  the sort of pat it onto your lid.<br>  And:<br>  Get better stuff, in a darker colour.|`|FEStjFIRaa	maybe is the type of skin you have that eats all the make up....hehe thats why i dnt wear eyeshadows they wont last on me!!!|`|81tlBAwIaa	use navy blue eye shadow or other really dark colors.|`|5qkhpiqXaa	maybe it just doesnt stay on, maybe you get your face wet try not to do that if u do

5Tzm6P97aa	a. Your picture doesn't work. b. Have you tried free weights? barbell curl's, where you take a bar with weights, grasp bar with a shoulder width under hand grip. With your elbows to side, raise bar until forearms are vertical. Lower until arms are fully extended. Dumbell curls, same as barbell but with the Dumbells. Bench press, Lie supine on bench. Dismount barbell from rack over the upper chest using a wide oblique overhand grip.With your elbows to the side, raise one dumbbell and rotate forearm until forearm is vertical and palm faces shoulder. Lower to original position and repeat with opposite arm. Continue to alternate between sides. Make sure you have a spotter for this particular excercise. All free weights should be done with a spotter of equal or more weight. Oh and push ups are good too try them on your fists and you'll get more use of your forearm muscles. If your not happy with your muscle growth, I suggest eating more protein and drinking lots of of water. Try low weight when you start and slowly go up. You shouldn't do any more then 100 reps per ecercise until you've done it atleast 8 times. I suggest starting with 15pounds and going up 5-10 pounds each time. I hope this helped, if you need more email me at ililac@yahoo.com k?<br>  good luck :)

geyX4iW2aa	It honestly doesn't hurt. It just feels like when you get a shot.. but its on your ears. If you go to  a nice place to get it done, they should give you cleanser. Use this daily so it doesn't get infected. Also get 14k or REAL sterling silver, so that it will not get infected. Try to go to like Piercing Pagoda or Claires, that way you can get good quality stuff and they will give you free cleanser.|`|nzFp11qyaa	nope..|`|a8f1f15273640c6a589fc8f62359c669aa	umm...it all depends on the person and how sensitive they are. It also all depends on how experienced the person who pierces your ears is. i got mine pierced and it felt like a pinch to my ear. it was only for a second and then everything was fine. Your ears might be a little sore for about a 2 days but then it's fine.|`|xqljgDHmaa	The flesh you are going to peirce has few nerve endings and almost no blood vessels. It won't bleed or hurt hardly at all.<br>  <br>  Pinch your ear, hard. That's how it'll feel. It's so fast you don't know what happened, and then it's over. SO easy. It's not a big deal at all! Be excited! Yay!|`|8jY4JUw7aa	does not hurt,keep it cleaned with peroxide,alcohol.vaseline,and dont take it out until they tell you|`|PbykKE2oaa	Yes it hurts for about 5 minutes. but after that you'll have pretty pierced ears =]|`|1T6ZvL84aa	I have 2 in each earlobe.<br>  It's a hard pinch, and it's a little stinging-type sore for about 20 minutes afterwards, but it's nothing to be worried about.  I have a low pain tolerance, and I'm fine.  I'm hopinh to get 1 more in my earlobes, and then 1 on top. :D<br>  Afterwards, (if where you're getting it done doesn't give it you) use a cottonball to rub the disinfectant/healing liquid on your piercing, in front & back, 3 times at day at least. And you have to twist your piercing in circles, both ways, several times!! At leeast 3 times day, or they will actually stick in your ears!! It hurts then, so remember to turn them!<br>  I hope I helped!<br>  Good luck, they'll look great(:|`|BKUhGTHdaa	Do not go to Claire's or anywhere that they use a piercing gun. Piercing guns cannot be cleaned properly and can damage your ear. Go to a tattoo parlor or somewhere where they use a sterilized needle.<br>  Everyone has a different pain tolerance. Ear piercings are not very painful compared to most piercings.There is some stinging at first, but it goes away after and then you're left with beautiful holes in your ears.|`|bNEJxVA2aa	NO..it dont hurt<br>  you'll just feel a lil pressure '&&  ahh kinda pinching feeling<br>  but it doesnt really hurt<br>  after u get ur ears pierced, they'll probly give u free antiseptic<br>  if u go tahh' claries they do<br>  if not..u can buy antiseptic, u have to put the antiseptic on the front and back of ur ear piercing and twist them every day <br>  they will probly explain this to u more when u get ur ears pierced<br>  GOOd lUCkk !!|`|YNxruoPIaa	well i just got my cartlidge and second bottom piercing and believe me u just feel a lil pain than it goes away after awhile i mean the cartlidge hurts worse the bottom pain goes away rite away u have nottin to worry about and after u gotta leave them in for 4-6 weeks and u gotta clean them... tell me how it goes! :)|`|cqK9GK6Yaa	Yes it does hurt for the first 5 minutes. Pain will subside. After, do not put an earring in it yet. Wait for it to heal and wash off any infections. Than wear an earring.|`|IszwcN0caa	Nope only feels like a little pinch ... you dont feel anything after that trust me itl be fine =]

If he's nice, he wouldn't care.<br>  I'd say wear whatever you want, and whatever you're most comfortable in. If someone gives you a hard time because of it, they're immature and not worth talking to.|`|lBqp3VYhaa	Do not wear the swim trunks and one piece, try a tankini if you feel uncomfortable.<br>  but with the guys swimming trunks, your crush might think your lesbian<br>  :/ <br>  no bueno!<br>  not good, at alll

Medication may have been ineffective, or he may not be disciplined enough in his hygiene routine to use it consistently.  A lot of acne goes through adulthood, especially if he was late to hit puberty.  If you have a close relationship it should be fairly easy for you to discuss it.  If you don't have a close relationship, then let it ride till you do.  I would hope he has enough good qualities where the acne isn't a big deal.|`|YTpizvPeaa	you can actually go to the doctors and they give yo anti-biotics..<br>  they take a while to work, but when they work they work better than anyting i've ever tried i'm 16 year old girl and i've suffered from acne, but these tablets really help..plus when i went to see my GP they said acne can go naturally, but sometimes if you dont do anything about it it can go on through adulthood, acne and spots are different, acne is a skin infection so anti-biotics clear it up..thats why stuff in the shops dont work..because thats for spots not for acne although the same result from the two is spots..i hope i helped..xx|`|Qsg0hwlYaa	Listen to me !.... i am also not far from that age and i went to a dermatologist. She made me take  a blood test. then she gave me Oral medicine called ' Roaccutane ' or something like that. I am on my 3rd month, and it should take at least 8. And i can see a good difference it really helps. That is the best medicine now out there. There are few side effects like dried lips and a bit dried skin but that is nothing, trust me. Just put some pomade. And i was also told to wash my face with some great moose for face washing.  Hope i helped u.

ua8dv6SMaa	Make sure your hair looks great. I suggest curling it and then using a metalic or brightly colored headband. NEVER PULL IT BACK!<br>  <br>  Wash your face morning and night, moisturize, and use zit medicine when u get zits so u don't need coverup. <br>  <br>  Wear really pretty and statement making (but not too out there) clothes. Wear something you will get lots of compliment on. Wear pretty jewelry and make sure ppl notice the jewelry first. <br>  <br>  If your lashes don't curl well without mascara i suggest using an eye lash curler. its not makeup!<br>  <br>  tweez your brows and upper lip if nessecary. <br>  <br>  overall just make sure that the rest of you looks great and wear things that will distract from your face.|`|s0zPqiIBaa	Make sure you face is clean and neat. <br>  Keep your eyebrows straight, you can use hairgel.<br>  Pinch your cheeks for a rosy look. <br>  Invest in some lipbalm to make your lips look smooth.<br>  Curl your lashes with some type of oil or vaseline.|`|87756LlTaa	I'd kill to have a month where I didn't have to wear make up.  It gets old pleasing everyone but yourself.|`|EL45UeUJaa	To try and calm down bags (if you get them and they are noticable) take a spoon and run it under cold water and hold it on each closed eye for about 10 seconds. Also make sure your eye brows and nice and shaped and plucked :D Just put on lotion and sunscreen everyday and make sure your face is clean :D|`|95uXmC94aa	Actually, I appreciate natural beauty :) I have gone LONGER without makeup and I was accepted pretty well into society these days haha. Moisturize your skin and stay happy. Get a lot of sleep so you don't have bags under your eyes and don't think negatively. Show your natural/outter and inner beauty and trust me, after this you might just stick to no makeup or just a really tiny bit!!!<br>  <br>  also you are 14. not the end of the world if you aren't wearing makeup -.- LMAO you're still a little kid<br>  <br>  <br>  I would have your eyebrows nice and plucked and groomed along with upper lips. That would be nice. (if you are allowed) I'm not!!|`|vnKbLsQdaa	I used to wear alot of make-up but now I have realised that I don't need to wear make-up<br>  <br>  If you rely on make-up now then you will definately rely on it when you are older and the only thing worse than this is for someone to see you wear loads of make-up then wear no make-up as you will look awful.<br>  <br>  Just start gradually decreasing the amount of make-up you wear and you and the people around you will get used to it and you wont need to make yourself "alot better!".<br>  <br>  Hope this helps x<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, curl your eyelashes then put a bit of vaseline on your lashes. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps too :) x|`|9WrqJ6Ueaa	I know not everyone likes tuna, but it makes your skin look amazing.<br>  The night before my grad I ate a tuna sandwhich (having reading the night before to do so).

eluLMSAraa	Totally! i know i've seen a guy wear that before but i'm not sure where...but it defnitely does look good, but it also depends on the fit of the hoodie and shorts. If the hoodie is baggy it will look great but if its the type of hoodie that shows of your pecks, that looks like body paint, then no. If you see the types of hoodie's Pete Wentz wears those would be perfect with cargo or board shorts!|`|eJMIazhLaa	I think that would look fine.

I am facing similar dilemmas, and yet every time I go to a near-by college town, I find great boutiques that nobody else has heard of! <br>  <br>  If that isn't a possibility, take up sewing, like I did. You don't exactly have to make all your own things (even though it's way fun), but you can then easily go to any second-hand store and tailor any thing you find into an original piece nobody else has, just by tailoring, adding details, or even removing details! <br>  <br>  For that, a sewing machine is best, but if that's a bit pricey you can hand sew. There are a lot of books with detailed illustrations showing you how, but I like the Ultimate Sewing Bible by Marie Clayton.|`|4OEl2ZJuaa	<a href="http://www.luckybrand.com/womens.aspx?l=00020000000000000000&cm_sp_o=tBFw5zTwCjC4zbEVyBFBCjCmtB58FE" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckybrand.com/womens.aspx?l=...</a><br>  get lucky brand jeans clothes|`|IQUkwqBuaa	Pac Sun.

rOj4B5QNaa	You should get it on whichever foot you would like.  One thing concerns me though.  You say you are getting it secretly done?  Foot tattoos are not very secretive, and on top of that they usually require touch ups because the skin is so thin and there is a lot of wear and tear to that part of the body.  If you are travelling a distance to have this done, then I would either suggest different placement or finding an artist in your area first that will touch anothers work.  Personally I would never get a tattoo while visiting somewhere unless it was somewhere that I visited frequently because I have had to have touchups on every single tattoo I have ever gotten.  Good luck!|`|yVmmDcwFaa	I think you should put it on the left foot :)|`|7rD3uJzdaa	Which ever foot you want it on? If it is a small piece it should not hurt that much? Hope my answer was helpful?

PtqN5WM3aa	It depends. A round face isn't much good if the person has a nose like a grilled tomato half and his eyes have disappeared in a fold of fat. On the other hand, thin, angular faces can be spoiled by tombstone teeth and a nose like a weasle.<br>  <br>  Learn to love whatever ya got, cuz it IS all you got. And some chick with a weasle or grilled tomato fetish will love you too!!|`|7nrhPCf0aa	probably  a pointed face with nice cheek bones, but it really depends on the guy.<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmbyfK3PMI9l9MEz6nls3KLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307132056AAkrnUs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|MbFS6XFQaa	it depends on the rest of his face.

rGBKhuS5aa	Normally it takes seven to ten days to ship when you order an item off the website. If you ordered from a store and didn't specify you wanted it shipped to your home address or another address, you need to pick it up.<br>  If the necklace was ordered online I would suggest contacting the customer service number and asking them to track your package by looking into your order. It could also be that the item you ordered is temporarily out of stock. Call to find out what happened to your order.<br>  Customer Service Number: 866.902.4438

bNheuULUaa	<a href="http://www.infinitink.com/consumer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.infinitink.com/consumer/</a><br>  <br>  there is a list on that page<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But make sure you want a tattoo before you get it. you shouldnt be getting a tattoo with the intentions of removing it in the future. it should be something you want
EL45UeUJaa	I would say for you a dark brown or espresso color, i think black may be a little too harsh for your skin tone. but Black mascara is fine :D<br>  I would try Covergirl exact twist up eyeliner, its waterproof and its a lot easier to apply than a liquid :D<br>  <br>  I would put it in the upper inner waterline to define your eye, and maybe you could do a thing line on your upper lid, and then line your lower inner waterline halfway if you want :D so it doest look TOO harsh.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Here is a very simple colour advice map. Roughly draw a circle and mark it wih six points. i.e. 12 o'clock, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.<br>  <br>  Next to 12 at the top, write red, then orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. You have three pairs of opposites, right? The colours of those <br>  pairs look the best wih each other and they are called colour complementaries. (Note, this word is spelt with an 'e,' no an 'i.' Look it up in your dictionary.)<br>  <br>  We can mix each pair of adjacent colours and get, starting from 1 o'clock and going clockwise: reddish orange, yellowish orange, lime,<br>  cyan, purple and magenta, the blueish red. Likewise, these colours are<br>  fantastic together. <br>  <br>  But not in great swathes. In make-up, you only want a touch. Your eyes are a stunning feature, but you are not all eyes. Your eyes are blue so ideally you would only want a touch of orange. Orange make-up do I hear you scream? No, not at all. You already have the touch of orange in your hair. That is perfect. Imagine that you swept the floors to help your mum with her houswork. Then, your mumcomes in and says, "Darling, would you be a real dear and sweep the floors up, please?"<br>  <br>  "But, but mum, I've already done them," you explain to her.<br>  <br>  "Doesn't matter, do them again."<br>  <br>  Your jaw drops. "It's not necessary," you fume.<br>  <br>  Well, that's what eye liner is about. Old ladies use it to try and make themselves look as lovely as you are and when you use it, you make yourself look like an old lady because they are the ones who use it.<br>  Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  Now, you are absolutely gorgeous. I am not going to tell you not to wear make-up because by using it, you will want to make yourself look better. That is fair enough, too. But you need expert advice from the lady whose job it is. First, ask your mum if she would come with you to a make-up party. Pick some times that are suitable for you both. Then, you can telephone the Avon Company and ask if their representative can include you both at her next party in your area. Of course, they will be delighted to help.<br>  <br>  You go. The lady will take everybody present through the stages of skin care and how to apply makeup prettily. She will suggest the colours that will look absolutely marvellous for you. Your mum will be so happy with the results for you both that she will get you a bit of make-up and it will last you for years. And you will always look just perfect.<br>  <br>  You do realise, you will not need much, don't you?|`|HLzegoKNaa	I would recommend Revlon Colorstay eyeliner in black-brown.<br>  It will look more natural and not too harsh.<br>  I am 15 and have been wearing makeup for like EVER.<br>  Anyways, I prefer to go natural for school with just some Black-brown lash stilleto mascara and black-brown revlon colorstay eyeliner. And some tan shimmery eyeshadow with a matte medium brown in the crease of my eye.<br>   for the liner: I apply it to my upper and lower lashlines really thinly and smudge it slightly.<br>  I also really love to use carbon black lineur intense liquid liner with a white shimmery eyeshadow and black lashblast mascara because it just makes my eyes pop, but that is my personal taste because I love like old-school (Katy Perry) pinup looks.<br>  If you have any questions feel free to message me.|`|5gqb2uzFaa	NONE. YOUR TO YOUNG TO BE WEARING EYELINER!!! I'M NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN BUT, IF YOU WEAR IT NOW , WHEN YOUR OLDER, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE WRINKLES AND LOOK UGLY!!
