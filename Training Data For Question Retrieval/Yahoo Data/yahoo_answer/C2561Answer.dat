I recently sold a '98 that had 170,000 miles on it. The engine and transmission never caused any problems, but anything else that could break did. Along with routine maintenance, I replaced the ABS control module, the air pump, the a/c condenser, all the power window and door lock switches, the headlight switch, the door panels (the vinyl covering peeled off the doors), replaced 4 wheel bearing hubs (front only), the steering rack went bad and had to be replaced.<br>  <br>  Basically, when I added it all up, I spent as much to keep the car on the road as I originally paid for it.

b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	Here are a couple of web sites to look at: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question172.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.howstuffworks.com/question172...</a>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.car-stuff.com/headers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.car-stuff.com/headers.htm</a>   <br>  <br>  There are a couple of negatives I can think of for not putting headers.  <br>  First, on an engine with that many miles (if it hasn't been recently overhauled) it might ( and that is a slight might) reduce the back pressure enough that the piston can go ever so slightly farther up in the cylinder and crack the top ring on the ring groove. <br>  Second, it will take up more space in the engine compartment and make it harder to work on other components when they need service, and make it more likely that a wire will get against one of the hot pipes and short out. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  ======================================...|`|5xxuKzXPaa	headers will not increase the life of the engine. they might change the sound out of the tail pipe but not much more in that car. headers allow the engine to breath a little better, or to move the spent gas out a little easier.|`|AA10698633	Headers are the same as the manifold except they are upgraded in terms of exhaust flow and performance.  Your car should be retuned to take advantage of this increased flow.  It will not necessarily decrease gas milage, except that to take advantage of this increased power, you will rev the daylights out of the engine, and the iincreased revs will hurt the milage.  And remember that the rest of the engine probably has a fair amount of wear on it and now driving it like a racecar.will put added stress on it.<br>  <br>  If you drive the corolla like the last 193K, the headers will make no difference  If you drive it like a race car expect the worst.|`|aa9gieAIaa	headers will be fine for an engine like that probably, the preprogrammed curves in the ecu will be so close to what you would want with headers usually it should run fine. it wont hurt your exhaust valves provided the mixture remains correct. actually restrictive manifolds are often harder on exhaust valves due to higher back pressure. you might get a few more hp but not much id guess, the stock manifolds are better than people think often.|`|mABnezzDaa	an exhaust manifold and a header are the same thing, I assume you mean change to a less restrictive, better flowing header where each cylinder has it's only exhaust pipe instead of some manis that dump 2 or so cylinders into one. A performance header won't do anything really to decrease your gas mileage or hurt your high mileage car,it'll just help with the formerly restricted exhaust flow and free up a few horsepower.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	it would not be logical to put a header on a corolla new or even less logical with this mileage, you are changing the breathing of the motor that has been broken in with the factory manifold.<br>  <br>  cost of buying and installing this would be spending money to cause the exhaust valves to burn and wear more.<br>  <br>  leave it the way it is|`|PTQA3n91aa	I am not a mechanic but I do know that headers increase exhaust air flow and I have heard can add about 15 - 20 Hp. I have NEVER heard of headers ruining an engine. Installing headers would increase hp and give the car a better sound and allow the engine to "exhale" alot easier. I hope this helped you out a little bit.<br>  <br>  p.s your stock exhaust manifold is most likley rusted to ****...so headers would look better also :)
nAzbLdBCaa	Let's start with the battery.  Your Group 27 battery is a good one.   It has plenty of cranking amps and will run a trolling motor.  It also is a low maintenance battery.......the charger is a pretty good one for the money.   I'd set it on 10A for the first few hours of recharging....there's little to be gained in charging very slowly at first, but I'd go to 2A say after 4 hours.   That will take several more hours to bring the battery to it's peak storage level.  My charger will cut completely off, once the battery is charged...I think the one you have will do this also.  Keep it simple.  Good Luck!|`|ND1nFEWSaa	any battery is a battery, a unit that holds voltage with lead plates surrounded in water diluted acid<br>  <br>  the slower the charge with the smallest voltage oveperiodlongest peroid of time is ALWAYS best for restoring a battery to its full voltage<br>  put charger on trickle charge and wait 3 days if you can. if thaccess ablehas accessable vent caps, remove them and put regular water to fill up to the FIRST shelf level.not to the very top (look inside for this)<br>  <br>  battery type.......standard<br>  battery size .......large|`|aa9gieAIaa	for a deep cycle battery charging it slowly is the best way. if you can wait just set it to the lowest setting. you can charge it as fast as you can discharge it it just breaks down more electrolyte and gets hot. you can charge it fast if your in a hurry otherwise trickle charge it. keep the acid topped off and use a hydro meter when adding water or acid to get the right strength. be careful to avoid sparks at the terminals if the battery is venting.|`|3dc195044c9507202073951c153c717daa	buy a se-1072 schumacher charger.  Charge up to 6 batteries at 5 or 10 amps.  Use for my lowrider which contains 8 deep cycle marine batteries.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Use the standard setting at 15A.  Don't change the setting after it starts charging -- the setting only sets the maximum starting current.  As the battery recharges, its internal resistance increases, which causes the charging current to decrease.  It's done when the current stops declining.<br>  <br>  Recharge your deepcycle within 24 hours of use, or as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Don't *DON'T* don't leave a battery unattended on a 2-amp trickle charger -- it can overcharge (and even boil a wet-cell battery dry).  <br>  <br>  Overnight is ok, if the battery's in good condition, but if your charger is "auto shut-off", way better to charge for a shorter time at higher current.<br>  <br>  If you have time, go back to walmart & see if they don't have one with "float mode", or "maintain mode" -- you can leave that hooked up 24/7, its the best way to maintain a battery.  I got one at Sam's for about $40.

Also you might have a neutral safety switch, put the car in park and the foot on the brakesand try to turn it over, if it works thats not it, if it didnt turn over that may be a problem.

94idwoK2aa	You can lift your truck safely 2-3 inches without even touching your suspension and without fear of rolling it the first turn you take.  It's called a body lift and all it does is raise your body off of the frame either 2 or 3 inches...that's it.  If your not mechanically inclined, you should take it to a body shop or professional that's familiar with these kits to have it installed correctly, but it is totally safe if done right. It won't compromise the handleing of your vehicle, because it has nothing to do with the suspension at all!  2 or 3 inches is not going to make your truck top heavy or make it more sucseptable to a rollover, don't worry.

AA10922071	Well, I answered your other question regarding the remote entry key fob, and now I see you do not have a factory radio!!  That is why you do not have the remote entry!  As for the radio, that is more difficult.  The factory radio will be very expensive, although it is very good.  The base model has excellent reception, and the one with a CD player is very expensive!  <br>  <br>  Crutchfield.com specializes on after market radios, and perhaps you can find one with remote entry.  They know what accessories are needed to install radios properly.  Most alarm and after market shops also sell remote entries, although they might be limited on choices of radios.  If the guys at Best Buy can not install the radio properly, do not let them do it.  I am sure the factory radio snaps into place, as the slot below does as well (where the CD would have gone.)  I have seen replacement radios in Honda's and any competent installer should be able to secure it in place by some means.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

I don't know where it is on your Explorer, but in the Taurus, it is in the trunk near the spare tire. <br>  A friend of mine had a flat on his and when he changed the tire and threw the flat into the trunk his car wouldn't start. It seems that the impact of the tire striking the floor tripped the interrupt switch. Good luck.|`|pJThuVtzaa	Its called an inertia switch and its used to cut off the fuel pump in case of an accident. It may be tripped if someone kicks the kick panel. The guy who answered before me is correct. That should be where it is located|`|PuMpS7fLaa	Passenger side front below the dash in the right hand corner. Should be above the carpet.|`|zOnyz5Tnaa	yes pass side kick panel or in back pass side behind panel far side of spare if inside - red button -|`|eq3gkeqpaa	Should be on the passenger side lower kick panel.

x7yKGaEDaa	Ash your going to save time and money having the dealer or local repair shop scan your computer and quote you a price for making a good repair.The OBD2 computer system used on your 2002 cavalier requires trained people with the proper tools to find and fix problems.Auto parts stores love to use low tech equipment and try to make you believe they can help diagnose newer computer and fuel problems.The fact is they sell parts and should leave this work to trained pros.They have already told you they think it COULD BE one of three different problems.They have no clue what your cavalier needs to correct your problem.Best of luck.|`|HacBjSZmaa	check your timing chain to see if it is worn or broke. if broke you will also have to replace the head.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Its a chevy.....

KlPRoeceaa	Do you mean a car alarm or one for your home? A home alarm system has many benefits including helping deter burglars from robbing your property; also, you can add services like smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, low temperature sensors (keeps your pipes from freezing). If any of these sensors detect a problem, including a break-in, the central monitoring station will be notified and they can dispatch the authorities if a crime is in progress. Another benefit is that many insurance companies offer a discount of 20% or so on your home-owner's policy if you have a security system. In today's economy, I suspect crime will rise and it would be very smart of you to protect your home.|`|xtOjABiGaa	Only advantges IMO.|`|8ey4ArjXaa	It stops burglars stealing your car by a big loud alarm that goes off.|`|9b7a7efedf922aa1216f91e527169449aa	none, if you don't put on the effort to activate it at night and when you leave. however if you do, it can help you from getting robbed, by setting off a loud alarm when the alarm is activated and anyway to get in is opened. (windows, doors, etc.) of course though, it gives you a bit of time so you can go in and deactivated so it doesnt go off everytime you come into your house. but if it does go off, usually the alarm company will call and ask you why the alarm went off, and if you are ok. if you dont answer the phone or say you're not ok, theyll call the police. you might also want to watch a show on discovery called it takes a thief, it goes on at 3 or 4 every afternoon.|`|5dTqcpMzaa	Criminals hate attention.

U87pqjJfaa	Well, my opinion is that there are many factors you have to understand. <br>  <br>  1. Size and length of your intake tubing. <br>  *some people think that larger or longer is better, which is not true. Your car has a peak performance point. This means that many Intake companies spend millions of dollars to do research and development to find the exact size diameter and length and curves to optimize your performance. <br>  <br>  2. You should buy a brand name, or now a days a Replica of a brand name. Since Intake are just Aluminium tubings anyway, <br>  <br>  3. Filter is the most important factor: Get yourself a real nice filter. K&N, HKS, Greddy, ARC and other name brands have better quality parts. <br>  <br>  Benefits: CAI= "generally cooler air" because it is intaking outside air. Short ram generally intakes the engine bays air. <br>  <br>  CAI= You can suck up water if you don't have a bypass valve.
X0AVSeNmaa	You should be comfortable when you drive, but you should not recline. If you like to have your seat back from the steering wheel, that's OK, but you should be sure your posture is safe. Air bags have warnings to tell us to be far back from the steering wheel so the air bag does not slam you if it deploys. So in that way, your posture is good. <br>  <br>  I am worried that you cannot reach the brake pedal if you are so far back. You need to be able to find the brake pedal and push the brake without reaching with your toes! Also, you may find that you cannot steer well in an emergency situation if your arms are extended straight out in front of you.  <br>  <br>  Please try to learn to move forward a bit. Your self-imposed limitation is really not productive unless there is a reason for it. (like you have an amputation or are extremely short) I teach beginner drivers to bend arms at elbow and hold the bottom of the steering wheel with knuckles on the outside of the wheel. Or you can hold the top of the wheel in 10 and 2 hand position, but that's old school.<br>  <br>  To be honest, your posture kind of scares me. I picture your mirrors out of whack, your feet unable to find the brake in an emergency, and your steering awkward and rough. I am concerned about your ability to practice good observation when changing lanes or reversing. <br>  <br>  Your posture is not necessarily wrong, but if it compromises your safety, you should watch other drivers and copy the safest person you know.<br>  <br>  You will be driving for decades, so it's a good idea to change this right away, before it is an unbreakable habit.|`|U87pqjJfaa	As long is you can operate the car then you should be okay. <br>  <br>  You must be able to have enough length to push down the gas and brake pedals. <br>  <br>  If your hands and legs are straight and barely touching the gas or brake pedal then it is dangerous. What if you need to stop?<br>  <br>  Can you fully depress the brakes ? If you can operate the car to it's full minimum and maximum with your legs and hands straight, then go ahead....if you can't then it's bad.|`|IwqTI7Rfaa	Whatever the position is that makes you feel comfy and drive that car/truck safely is the best one for you to be in!

fl60KL8oaa	Definitely cheaper, but only in lieu of a car.  It is not cheaper to have both and only ride on nice days.  You can get rain gear that will keep you dry.   Wool under leather will keep you warm.  Getting the license would depend on where you are, go to your local Department of Motor Vehicles and ask.  There are schools that teach basic riding and safety:  <a href="http://www.msf-usa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msf-usa.org/</a> in the US.  Highly recommended.<br>  <br>  You bike choice depends on your needs and desires.  For practicality don't overlook the scooters:  <a href="http://www.powersportsnetwork.com/enthusiasts/new_vehicle_compare.asp?vehicle1=87096&year2=2009&mfg2=2&vehicle2=87098&go=Go" rel="nofollow">http://www.powersportsnetwork.com/enthus...</a> The C3 is suitable for local travel at speeds under 45 mph, the Majesty is capable of interstate touring.

If you have a bike sitting in a garage, you will be tempted to ride it before you are ready ( at least I know I would be... )<br>  <br>  Where do you live?  Keep in mind that with motorcycles, you are more at the mercy of the weather compared to a car ( especially important when you are a nOOb rider ).  Unless you live somewhere hot and dry all year long, or you have alternative transportation for those days when the weather is bad, a motorcycle may not be the best choice for you.|`|accee57f3c7d9675579a1fa5e6c02e93aa	It's not hard to learn but there are things you need to consider.  Before I go into that I'll answer your questions.  The easiest way to get your license is to take a rider safety course.  At the end of the weekend you can test for your license.  Check local community or technical colleges.<br>  <br>  Now, before you make up your mind, consider the climate you live in.  If it rains regularly, how will you get where you need to go on those days?  Sure, you can ride in the rain but you end up soaking wet at your destination.  If it gets cold, you'll need to consider that.  I used to ride in Wisconsin in January (when the streets were clear) but would always have numb legs when I got to my destination and that was only a 10 minute ride at 35 mph!!<br>  <br>  How will you get groceries?  Trust me, taking a backpack and loading up four times per week gets old quickly.  If you don't have a washer/dryer at your home, how will you get to the laundromat to get clothes washed?  <br>  <br>  Lots of things to consider before you buy one. Make sure you've considered everything before jumping in.  If you do decide to get one, have fun, they're a blast!

So be confident. Even if there are one or two extra-curricular questions, your reading of the book should give you the common sense and overall context you would likely need for such a question.

EcEMMx2Daa	I don;t believe you car has a fill port directly on the radiator. you have to fill it thru the reservoir. if it's running out as fast as you put it in,you have a serious issue. waiting to repair it will end up costing<br>  a lot more than taking it in for repair & renting a car for the time it's in the shop. If this sounds too expensive price a head replacement, or worst case, engine replacement. Every time you overheat your engine you shorten it's lifespan considerably. and a heads up, if you are adding coolant and there is no leak visible you may already have a blown head gasket.

This can be a good thing, and it can be a very bad thing, depending on the dealership you work through.<br>  <br>  You will also find Piaggio, the parent company behind Vespa, to be quite reliable.

0ZMudA8aaa	As said before, 87 octane is the best and is recommended in your owner's manual.  The ECM is set up for 87's burn rate and when changing to a higher octane, the computer goes through a relearning period adjusting timing, air/fuel ratios, among other changes to adjust to the new burn rate and it usually results in long term poor mileage and possibly a rough running engine.  Best to stick with the recommended fuel.|`|0e74e22051a483161d57678a49250e69aa	87 octane unleaded.|`|boh5rCNlaa	regular 87

It might give you a slight increase in performance but a stock Jeep 4 liter is a lower compression engine that don't need anything more then 87 octane.  I say Mobil is the best brand but there about all the same as long as they don't have ethanol added.  I stay away from that, it gives poor MPG and clogs up fuel injectors and destroys the performance of your engine in the long run.  The 4 liter engine you have is the best engine Jeep has ever had,  If you change the oil every 3000 miles that engine will go 500000 miles or more.  They were once called a 258 Cubic inch engine and have been put in Jeeps for years. There great, to bad they got rid of them now.  Hope that helps.|`|KPFQBQa1aa	My Jeep seems really tolerant of fuels.  I am a big fan of Shell or BGP/Amoco when I suspect a fuel related problem.

RWjvcCYoaa	It seems that you had a pickup payment to complete your down and you haven't made it. Now you feel that its the dealer's loss since you're already financed. Wrong!<br>  <br>  The financing is predicated on your promise to pay X amount down. You signed a legal contract stating this. If you don't live up to your agreement, the dealer can unwind the deal since you failed to pay the amount agreed on. And that voids the contract. Meaning you do not own the car and never have. The dealer has every right to repo the car. <br>  <br>  Now here's where it gets even worse for you. Once the dealer takes the car back, he can sue you for the market value he's lost by your driving it for 6 months. He can also sue you for the balance owed on the down payment. Once he wins a judgment against you, he can attach your wages, attach your bank account and any real or personal property you may have until he is paid in full. <br>  <br>  You will also be liable for criminal charges of defrauding a dealership, a felony. And he can pursue that too, if he wants to. Is all this worth it? Pay the dealer at once. Get this over with now. The consequences for not paying up is just too costly.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Yes, they can take it. And they will. You will get nothing back, and be walking. Pay the man! He needs to pay his bills, too. Good luck.|`|cRxoNPYkaa	If he let you take the car and you agreed to pay more down than you did, then yes, he has every right to take the car.  You signed the paperwork, I assume.  If you agreed to pay it, then just do what you said you would do.  Did you think he'd just forget about it?|`|Sb3Z19Myaa	Something doesn't sound right to me. If it is financed by your bank, your bank is who would be threatening to take your car not the dealer. If you owed the dealer something your bank didn't pay that would be a different story.
ND1nFEWSaa	there should be two lights, and i have never heard of this happening,  once the lights are off, all 12 volt power is disconnected to the entire lighting system.<br>  <br>  shortcut;........ install a blown fuse in the fuse location. connect a jumper wire from the "live" side of another fuse ( there are two sides to a fuse, the feed and the draw, one always is supplying 12 volts and the other accepts it to deliver it to a electric need or unit, (radio, light etc)<br>  <br>  using a test light to find this, with the key on pull a random 20 amp fuse and put the test light inside the pulled out fuse area to see which side is "live". insert a 14 gage wire in here and plug this fuse back in, now when the key is on this wire will HAVE voltage and when the key is off it WILL NOT have voltage.<br>  run the wire to the draw side of the license plate blown fuse to feed the circuit only when the key is on.<br>  <br>  if you understand this, and do it it will work|`|eq3gkeqpaa	The most likely cause of this is that there is another short back feeding the ground side of the circuit. Look around the bulb there will be another wire around it that is shorting to ground. The short can be so minor that it wont blow a fuse but because of its proximity to the license plate bulb it is feeding the light. Its pretty common. This happens often on vehicles that are wired for trailers. There is a constant 12v hot wire that can get broken off or chaffed and touch the chassis causing the license plate bulb to turn on. Check the wiring for a chafe or break in the wire.

AA10643879	1 and 2 is 1st and 2nd gear,for the car running in low gear without upshift.Burn out is no good for the car,any car.|`|Hg7QdVktaa	If its auto im not sure but for manual get something to lock the font brakes and try|`|HeMYzftiaa	The "1" and "2" mean gears 1 and 2. Switching to either of those keeps the car in either 1, or in nothing above second gear, good for situations where you need to stay in low gear, such as maintaining speed downhill without wearing brakes, or other low-gear situations. <br>  <br>  Also to do a burnout, it depends if your car is front-wheel, or rear-wheel drive. I didn't look it up, but I think it's rear wheel, but you should look it up because burnouts on FWD vehicles are impossible.<br>  <br>  Also, it depends on your transmission. If you have a stick, it's really easy. However, considering it's a police car, and considering you have a "D" as a shifter option you're definitely running an auto. So.. if you're automatic, your best bet is to press both the brake (really hard) and step up the gas. Find the point at which the brakes kinda stop working and you start moving anyway (in terms of RPM). Then do it again, and release the brake RIGHT before the engine speed (RPM) where your brakes stopped working. This will cause your wheels to spin out, you'll do a burn out, and that's that.<br>  <br>  By the way, it wears down your tires and your drivetrain like crazy, and very bad for them both. Unless you want to replace your tires (and axles) very very early, don't do it often.|`|XFHleRhWaa	ALL Crown Vics are rear wheel drive, If it's a police model the sometimes lock out low which is 1st gear so you can not use it, or abuse it. 1 and 2 are the two lowest gears on a three speed transmission, Yes it has a lock up torque converter giving a 4th gear in effect. If you want to burn out, step on the brake lightly and keep pressing as you apply the gas, just like a mustang, the engine will turn the rear and overpower the breaking action and burn the tires while holding the front tires still. Yes it's hard on the transmission it taken to the extreme, HEAT, and the wear on the rear brake pads/shoes, and loss of tire rubber, but you got to have fun in life!|`|AA11677524	yes you can burnout in it I drive a crown vic too.

64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	1977-1990 Caprice wheelbase and track width are almost perfect for '55- '59 trucks.  '55-'59 short beds are 115" wheelbase.  The Caprice is 116", so no wheelbase changes are needed at all.  The drawbacks are that you have to raise the bed floor to clear the rear axle kick up and there are also other body modifications needed as the Caprice frame rails are a little too wide.<br>  <br>  The other option is the '73 - '87 Chevy/GMC full size short bed pickup chassis.  The track width is close but they are 118" so they have to be shortened 3" and the front wheels will end up 1" forward from stock. S-10 chassis work well for pre-'55 trucks, but do not work well for '55-'59 trucks.  The S-10 wheelbase is okay, but the track width is too narrow.|`|mQWn7NGaaa	you could measure an s10 pickup frame. they are set up for a 4.3 v-6 and a 350 will be a direct bolt in swap on this frame. they have disc brakes and good rear-ends. a lot of hot rodders are starting to use them for modernizing older cars and trucks|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	Generally the basic components back then didn't change for 10 years or more.

FKJaQXQLaa	It could be your crank position sensor.  It is usually located on the transmission.  Mine went out once and all it would do was crank but not start.  Having it replaced by a shop is a ripoff.  Get a Chilton manual and do it yourself.  It should only take about 5-10 mins.|`|k55p1pKraa	It sounds like your loosing power , maybe the alternator isn't working right, the ignition module is getting hot causing it to dead out.|`|QX7QqGFsaa	I experienced a similar problem with my 95 YJ. Verify you have spark with a spark plug tester. If you are getting spark on all six plugs, then it is probably a fuel issue. Using a multimeter, measure the voltage at the fuel pump. You can do this at the relay if you wish. If the measured value is less than 12V, then you should replace the relay. A bad relay was the culprit for my problem. Remember: always check the simplest things first. If the fuel pump is recieving adequate power, check the fuel pressure using a fuel pressure tester.<br>  <br>  It is difficult for people to help when the only information you provide is that you own a Jeep. What year and model is your Jeep?|`|mzWk9GnVaa	Assuming your Jeep is fuel injected, the problem sounds like a bad fuel pressure regulator. You should start by testing the fuel pressure. If pressure is good, then you'll need to test your fuel injectors. If they check out fine, too, then you probably have an ignition issue. You can perform the necessary tests on the ignition system, too. Most Haynes and Chilton's repair manuals have the proper procedures and specifications for these tests.|`|KPFQBQa1aa	You most likely have a clogged fuel filter.  Often changing the pump stirs up stuff that can clog the filter.  I recently had a strange problem similar to yours where the Jeep would run fine for a bit and then die.  Sometimes it would restart but most of the time you had to let it sit a while.<br>  <br>  That one turned out to be a bad hose between the pump and the metal part that holds the pump.  I pulled the pump out three times before I found it.  It would read the right pressure sometimes and other time not.  <br>  <br>  Mike<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mikestrawbridge.com/jeep-cherokee-off-road.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://mikestrawbridge.com/jeep-cherokee...</a>|`|uH32skl3aa	I would say fuel filter.  But your not giving me enough information.  Providing you have spark at the plug.  then that would be my guess. If that don't do it check the fuel pressure at the injectors, could be the fuel pressure regulator.  Keep it simple. An engine needs only three things to run, Spark, Compression, and Gas.  Yours don't have gas I bet!  Hope that helps.

qT3bi1Ynaa	One or more of the carb floats have let gas by into the engine.  Change the oil and take the carbs off and check the condition of the needles and seats plus clean the carbs.  Drain the fuel tank and clean it too as a precaution.  BEFORE YOU EVEN TRY TO START IT CHANGE THE OIL.|`|z8u8qFJeaa	After sitting for that long it is pretty normal, if it persists after you have ridden it for a couple of weeks you might try some oil additive to "recondition" the rings.|`|AA10690406	Gasoline in your oil is caused by one or more of your carbs overflowing and not being able to drain out of their overflow tubes for whatever reason. If a carb is overflowing and it don't come out of the overflow tube than the only other place for it to go is down the intake port and in to the cylinder where it will leak through the piston ring's gaps and down in to the crank case. I would change the oil, drain the carbs and make sure none of the overflow tubes are kinked or clogged and if any of the carbs continue to overflow you may have to remove them and correct the problem by cleaning them and/or do a float level adjustment.

Next do the parking lot hard stop thing. That will often turn the light off. If these things don't fix it then have the mechanic pull the abs codes.

As along as its just the ABS light that it on it should not effect your ability to stop.

A wheel sensor could have been damaged when the clutch was replaced which means your mechanic is fobbing you off so he doesnt have to pay for damage he caused. Wheel sensors are expensive and easily damaged buy hammering too close to them, maybe when removing front cv joints etc. When the light is on the abs switches off , so yes your car is un safe to drive until you fix the problem.Insurance in an accident will be affected too so dont crash into a lamboughini or your life will be shity forever

Other wise, if you obtain the licenses/ratings as you go the following will become familiar terms to you:<br>  -- Private Pilot License<br>  -- Instrument Rating<br>  -- Commercial License<br>  -- Multi-Engine license/add-on<br>  -- Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)<br>  -- Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII)<br>  -- Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI)<br>  -- Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI)<br>  <br>  I would also recommend www.aopa.org to investigate learning to fly.

A good way is to find a university that does a bachelor of aviation. I found a course at Griffith University in Brisbane Austrlia, they work with QANTAS who take majority of students. The course takes 3 years to complete and you leave with a commercial pilot licence. International Flight Companies (QANTAS, United Airlines, British Airways) can hire you as a first officer (co-pilot), where you then work your way up to captain. <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  by the way to get into the course, u need to do english, maths b and physics

Only cut and weld the frame RAW and without tires (use posts; welded jack stands)<br>  <br>  after you cut it, use a good straight edge and make sure you bring it back square / use channel welds (IE: groove the metal and run at least 3 beads) then use a "Fish Plate" to cover both sides of the weld to return the structure of the weld point.  <br>  <br>  I would not use a normal 'mig' welder for that, normal mig's cannot get hot enough, use a good AC/DC welder in AC mode with no less than a 7016 rod.<br>  <br>  If you have access to the right hardware use a 4 wheel alignment machine - or use lasers to set your squares - getting it right the first time is the only way to do the work.|`|AA11096064	Mig welder with gas.

wdUjTU50aa	MERCEDES BENZ ..fast and safe.|`|9b0cb426c6c3104dea7bf7f4254af05faa	I would go with the 350, Nissan is a great car company and many performance and visual upgrades are available for this car. It is also made by the Japanese who are known for quality and reliability of their cars, so it wont be braking any time soon. The Benz SLK will start to have problems after maybe three years and same with the BMW. Nissan makes performance parts for there cars through a company called "Nismo" all these parts are custom made for you car and built with the same quality as the car, so if you wanted to trick your car out this is a great way to do some of it or all of it. The 350 is well built, fast, and cool looking. Hope this helps but ultimately you should make the choose don't let some one else decide for you.

If possible, have a mechanic check it as soon as you can. If it is a manual transmission, you can push start it, but you reallly need to find out what the real problem is. Hope this helps, Good Luck.

A good suggestion, if I may...My brother is restoring his 77 Impala, and he decided to use very thin carpet, like marine Daystar carpet.  For one, it looks very nice.  For 2, it adhears very nicely to almost anything, if you use a good glue.  For 3, marine Daystar carpet is mold resistant, water resistant, and you can find it in a variety of colors.  He even went as far as to carpet the sun visors.  And lastly, its not too expensive.  Other than ordering whole new dash and such, this may help you out if you are looking for a cost effective way to restore your car.  And as far as painting it, well, lets just say dont go there, it will never look appealing.

uUVdCKV6aa	i bought a 2009 chevy cobalt last week. it is a two door (4 door models are available). it has a manual transmission and a 2.2L engine. it looks pretty sporty with its large spoiler, red paint, and sport seats. on the way back from the dealership, i got 43 mpg on the interstate cruising in 5th gear at about 70 mph. this is really good, especially because the engine is not even broken in yet. i get 35 mpg in town, and i drive pretty aggressively. it cost about $15,000 for the car with tax, title, and license. so overall, not a bad deal. if you need a bigger car, look at the impalas. i have a 2008 impala as well and i get about 37-40 mpg on the open road with that. however, the impala was more than double the price of the cobalt. it also was new though too! good luck!|`|ywPADGDNaa	I sell chevy cars and personally I would go with a new generation Malibu.  you can find one with the 2.4 I4 that can get around 30 MPG. They claim they get 25 but I have seen a lot of people getting 30. They are the best built chevy's I have seen in a while. They are made to look more luxurious than previous years. Plus they come with so many features in the base model. The interior is really nice and really roomy. My fiancee has one and we have friends who are 6 foot plus get in with no problems and have plenty of room. They have noise deadening steel that blocks all road noise. Plus the driver and passenger side windows are the same glass as the windshield making it stronger and quieter. I drive my fiancees and you will not even realize you are going 80 you really hear no road noise. The suspension is great and they ride smooth. My step dad who has only driven lexus says that it drives better and is more quite than his RX 330. A plus is a base model can come with a sunroof because they are a free flow option. If you want something smaller and that will get better MPG's go with a Cobalt XFE they will get 37MPG. plus they may not be as luxurious and aesthetically pleasing as the malibu but they will get good gas mileage and have a better warranty than most companies. I would suggest driving both and seeing what you like best. If you can afford the Malibu I would get it, because it will last you and has room for anything you might be facing in the next 5 to 6 years before upgrading or trading.|`|LamVaAETaa	Malibu.

If the size of the vehicle is not a problem (and you don't need a lot of storage space) I would go with an Aveo.

The diamater of the rim is slightly larger than the diamater of the bead, so it hugs very tightly and does not allow air to escape.     In a tubeless tire the tire itself acts as a tube, the tire is airtight and so is the rim and once you seat the bead on the rim the seal is very tight and air tight as well.|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	It seals to the rim (bead)|`|dVQdswtTaa	If you look at a car tire off the rim, the bead is the inside edges of the "donut".

Because they fit so tight and since the rim doesn't have any holes in it, the air has no place to go and it stays in the tire.    http://www.offroaders.com/tech/AT-MT-Tir...|`|DV4xyeChaa	tire and rim hold air...|`|lmSoNMhPaa	the tire bead is what is next to the wheel thick rubber. the air will stay in if there are no holes in the tire
c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Is KBB $12,655 retail or trade in price?  Do you know how long the car has been on their lot?  Dealers don't usually sell for less than they have invested in the car unless it's been in inventory too long.  They have to make some money to keep the doors open.  If $12,655 is trade in, that's close to what they paid for it.  They may have added new tires, cleaned it up, fixed any dings, did a state inspection, repaired/replaced some parts, etc. to make it in excellent condition.  Factor an estimated amount for those things when you take a real hard look at the car.  And ask the salesman if they did any of those things.  If you make a ridiculous offer, the salesman may blow you off or choose to write it up to qualify you as a "real" buyer & come back with a rejection or counter offer from the manager.  When negotiating, you can always go up but you can't go down.  The best is a "win/win" result.  You get the car you want at a satisfactory price & the dealer moves a car & make a little money.|`|328e52056e90a15c3247940d35d04602aa	Goto http://www.autotrader.com and look what other similar cars are going for.

Just make sure you run a Carfax and hire a mobile mechanic to check over the car. Only costs around $80. Good price for a peace of mind.|`|WHDQ068iaa	don't be cheap!  they are probably aware that they have a car that is rare and thus reflects the price they have it at.  either spend a little more money than you want and get the car you want or settle for something less.  If someone came to my dealership with that offer we would kindly thank them and let them be on their way.  keep in mind that dealerships incrue reconditionaing costs which is probably why the car is so clean so keep that in consideration.  you need to stop worrying about nickles and dimes and just buy it if its the car you want.|`|wpgRMjgraa	20 percent is usually the best way to start out but try the lower figure and see what happens and be ready to turn and walk if they start the (BS) with you...
DlbmXvS4aa	Non è uno scooter molto diffuso, per cui penso che i forum siano pochi, se non nulli. Il difetto principale dello MP3 è sicuramente il peso, per cui con un 250 dovresti aspettarti accelerazione da 150. Personalmente preferisco la Vespa, però ho provato l'MP3 e ti garantisco che offre una sensazione di sicurezza impareggiabile. Ovvio, se si esagera tanto si può cadere, ma nelle condizioni normali, non c'è pericolo. Il consumo dipende da quanto apri l'acceleratore... comunque il motore è molto parco, uguale a quello della GTS 250 che uso tutti i giorni. La protezione dal freddo è migliorabile e puoi usare un parabrezza più alto, perdendo qualcosa in velocità ed accelerazione|`|U7wRpf4Maa	Ciao... x trovare un po di info ti consiglio di prenderti un giornale (tipo in moto) : ce n sono sempre + ke ne parlano.. sinceramente da quello che ho letto nn è molto positivo anke se è molto stabile... ricordati ke 3 ruote è sicuramente ingombrante e meno maneggevole...|`|efD45Auqaa	secondo me è una pataccata,caxxo centra frà le moto un veicolo a 3 ruote-.-

Y tambien depende el entrenamiento que quieras recibir, puedes volar para obtener los requisitos para ser candidato a una licencia comercial mexicana sacas la licencia de piloto privado vuelas 30 horas por instrumentos 10 horas de bimotor y sigues volando hasta acumular 180 hrs de vuelo y con eso vienes a mexico tomas unos examenes y te dan tu licencia de piloto comercial de Mexico. Y eso cuesta mas o menos unos $22,000.00 dolares. Ahora si tienes el dinero y quieres salir mas preparado puedes sacar todas las licencias americanas y eso te sale mas o menos en unos $45,000.00 dolares. Pero si sales mejor preparado y los tramites de convalidacion para las licencias mexicanas es mas rapido y sencillo.  Cuando consigas trabajo en Mexico normalmente empiezas en los aviones mas chicos de la compa?ia haciendo vuelos cortos y conforme vaya creciendo tu experiencia te iran subiendo de puesto y volaras rutas mas largas hasta cuando menos te des cuenta ya estas cruzando los oceanos de un continente a otro.

5X523F71aa	Unlike one of the other above answers, people do regularly sue insurance companies.<br>  <br>  There are typically 2 reasons why an insurance company would be sued:<br>  <br>  First, bad faith. For example, after Hurricane Katrine, Allstate was sued because they tried to avoid paying any home insurance claims. This goes against the principle of insurance and they deserved to be sued. This is bad faith.<br>  <br>  The second and actually most common reason insurance companies are sued is because of disagreements with claims. Often times, insureds steadfastly refuse to accept the insurance company's decision, and sue to try to obtain a desired result. For example, if you have a car accident and the insurance company rules the accident to be your fault, your final course of action would be to sue to attempt to be ruled not-at-fault.|`|d92UzA2oaa	People don't actually sue the insurance company - the insurance companies are not the at fault parties - they are not even parties to the losses - they only represent the party that is involved in a loss. So, if a person were to sue an insurance company - say because they disagreed with the pain and suffering offered in a bodily injury settlement, their suit would be thrown out as they would have filed against the wrong party. They must file suit against the negligent tortfeasor.<br>  <br>  Usually - people do sue the negligent tortfeasor because they do not agree with the amount of pain and suffering, or liability, etc...<br>  <br>  The only time an insurance company would be sued in the case of a claim - would be due to bad faith claims handling, most states only allow this as a first party suit, however some do allow it in a third party situations as well.|`|62UOraX0aa	because insurance companies will not pay for losses unless they are forced to
69942f826bae7b10980cfdbf7bda2100aa	Bad connection. Be it a ground, battery or internal to a cable.<br>  A test light can be a great tool in this situation. Hook the clip to the battery negative post and the probe into the positive cable near the battery post. When try to crank it see if the light goes out. If not move the probe further along or to the starter terminal from the battery. If the light doesn't go out, then reverse the procedure for the negative cable to the frame and engine. You will find the problem.|`|633f9f0030592c33a86ce834c645dcc3aa	Sounds like you  have a loose ground wire or a wire going to the starter is not tight.|`|YA2mKkzuaa	Are you sure that it is in park.  Your tranny could be sticking and that is why ie won't start but you have power. Try ramming it into park.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	clean the battery terminals real good and the hot wire on the starter also check the ground cable to make sure it's making a good ground, it's possible you are going to have to replace the hot and ground battery cables if it doesn't start after doing the above.
d61fe9c635aabba484ffb94cc0c1a7b0aa	Some customers may comment that their fuel gauge is inaccurate or reads empty on their diesel equipped chassis cab with dual tanks. There may be DTCs P1172, P2066, P0461, P2068, and/or P2636 set in the ECM. This concern may be caused by two different concerns:<br>  <br>  THIS STEP ONLY APPLIES TO THE LLY OR LBZ 6.6L ENGINES. Root cause may be the float arm is getting hung up on the rear fuel tank filler opening pipe (filler spud) on trucks equipped with the LLY or LBZ diesel engine. <br>  Root cause may be the float arm on the rear tank stuck in the up position resulting in setting the sensor card in an open location and driving the gauge to empty. Since the sweep of the rear float arm on diesel trucks is less than the front tank, a plastic rectangular stop was molded into the sensor. However, with certain vertical inputs (loaded vehicle going over bumps), it is possible for the rear tank float arm to jump over the stop and then get stuck on the top of the stop, thus lodging the float arm in the up position and setting the sensor card to an open location. <br>  Recommendation/Instructions:<br>  THIS STEP ONLY APPLIES TO THE LLY OR LBZ 6.6L ENGINES. Engineering has shortened the filler spud by approximately 2 1/4 inches. Since the fuel spud is sonic welded into the plastic fuel tank the correction will be to replace the tank assembly with part number 15825666. If the float arm had previously been adjusted it will also have to be replaced with part number 25351753|`|b32e645ca8c826d8ee9b6a28147f89b0aa	Sec Fuel Pump Insufficient/No Fuel Flow<br>  <br>  is what I could find on what it means.

Don't just factor in a lot of power and good handling, you might want some luxury ammenities, good fuel economy, reliability, passenger seating, etc. <br>  <br>  A few on that list I would consider is the Infiniti G series, Maxima or Altima (check out the Altima Coupe), 300C, Camry, Legacy (or Impreza or WRX), Fusion, or MKZ.|`|wTKn7yA6aa	Narrow it down to 2 or 3 and ask again. <br>  <br>  With a list that long, you won't be buying a car ANYTIME soon.
JtM2NBlhaa	if the center brake light is your brake light switch is OK. your right and left brake light go thru the turn signal switch after the brake light switch. check your turn signals also. you will probably need the turn signal switch replaced. unless you a knowledgeable of the air bag system, for safety reasons this is best done by mechanic / technician. this steering wheel must be removed to replace turn signal switch.|`|AA11788274	brake light switch should be near the brake pedal somewhere....
QZ82tpNiaa	I work for Valvoline Instant Oil Change and the only time we will not allow the customer to stay in the vehicle is durring a tire rotation.<br>  <br>  As far as services go, the only service at a place like that, that is not done by a machine designed for that task is an oil change, weather it is crank case, differential, transfer case for a 4x4. <br>  <br>  For the money, you really can't complain because they also check your air filter(s), check and fill your washer fluid, power steering fluid, coolant and transmission  fluid. We also check your serpentine belt (fan belt for those of you who do not know what a serpentine belt is) for cracks and dry rotting. We check and fill the air in your tires according to the manufacture recommendations.  It may seem pricy, but when you consider the free fluid top offs between oil changes it could really pay for itself in the long run if you use fluids in your vehicle.<br>  <br>  Long story short, the dealerships offer the same services we do, using the same equipment, at a higher price.  Your choice.<br>  <br>  And yes, we do take credit, check or cash|`|7HEZhx46aa	You can sit in your car. You position your car over a pit and the work is done from below. There are guys that also do things under the hood. All YOU have to do is open the hood and shut your engine off.<br>  You can also get out of your car if you want to -- they have waiting areas with television and junk food machines.<br>  <br>  They do take credit cards.<br>  <br>  I get my oil changed at Express Oil every 4000 miles.
QZ82tpNiaa	You live in a valley? Try using a fuel line drying agent that is added to your gas tank. Sounds like there may be moisture in your fuel system. I like the idea of a tune up on the spark system, plugs wires roter and cap.<br>  If the vehicle is running at lower than normal operating rpms, the vehicle will want to die and will light up the battery light.<br>  You may also have a clogged or patially clogged injector. Another thing to look at is the last time you had your fuel filter changed. If it is dirty, with no fuel moving through the dirt can crystalize and cause poor passage of the fuel. Once ran for a while it could clear up on it's own but will eventually clog totally and not run at all.|`|AA12261615	you could have an alternator going bad on it ,and it will rob it of much needed power ,and cause it to do that,what you need to do is take it and have it checked out real good,any good repair shop can do this for you,and maybe find out why this is happening to it,id have it done before it got worse,if nothing else seems wrong with it,then it may be something simple,but you, need to have it checked,and have the computer scanned,ever whats causing this may have left a trouble code ,and the computer will have this in its memory,good luck on it,hope this helps.|`|kZhkXlUnaa	Sounds like you're way down on power.<br>  <br>  The "chugging" is your engine wanting to stall<br>  <br>  The first place to start would be a full tune up and oil change if not done already. Full tune up would be spark plugs, ignition wires, distributor cap and rotor, air filter, fuel filter, O2 (oxygen)sensor, and thermostat. At this age you very well may need new fuel injectors or at the very least have them professionally "cleaned" Also if you're engine uses a timing belt or chain I'm not sure but if it is a belt that may need to be changed too. Always a good idea as a broken timing belt can destroy your engine. Finally, have the charging system checked and the cooling system flushed.<br>  <br>   If the battery light is coming on you need to get the battery tested and possibly replaced and then check all cables and wires (going to the battery). <br>  <br>  Next it seems you're car is having trouble "warming up". This could be a simple sensor (like the O2 sensor) or the thermostat. <br>  <br>  While you are having these things checked I would go ahead and have the accessory belt(s) checked.<br>  <br>  You're car is 13 years old, have it checked out!! : ) Hope this helps....
AA12261615	you need to check all the battery connections on it,that will cause it to do like you described,other wise it sounds like a bad ignition switch on it,if you cant find it have a shop take a quick look at it,usually they will check one over real fast for free,and it beats guessing,or buying parts you really don't need,good luck on it hope this helps.|`|xTt2jqxeaa	sounds like your ignition switch is bad.|`|AA11693149	Well it could be the battery, starter going out of it, battery terminal lose, some kind of plug gone bad, if I were you I would have it checked out by a professional to look at it to make sure what the problem really is.|`|QZ82tpNiaa	could have a short in the steering column melting plastic parts inside the column. this could also make lights blink and, in general, affect most of the electronic components throughout the column|`|b4307ab7da6f64a6b5c1f84e5f870c5daa	Sounds like you have an anti theft device that's not working properly.  check with the dealer to see if they have a fob for it, or maybe an after market security place to see if they could figure it out.  I've seen these before, and it's like clock works, if you wait it will start, and it's a security device.

d2Hhh5MQaa	Don't know much about off road bikes, but still it sounds like an idle adjustment problem. Could be something else, but if the throttle cable is tight and snaps back easily then my guess is the idle screw is turned to high (or the lack of the screw). Below is a link to bikebandit.com's parts fiche. You can always access the parts fiche on Yamaha's site as well. I simply like Bike Bandit due to the fact you can open the schematics into a new window while looking for other parts. Good place to do business with too. Not the quickest in the world, but good pricing.<br>  <br>  Other option would be to search for some Yamaha dirt bike forums and look for some help there. Good luck...
UZSythqhaa	If it is a loss to you then call a tow company to take it to the scrap yard give them the title and they will junk it for you and ussually pay you about a hundred bucks for the scrap steel.Good Luck<br>  <br>  PS write salvage on the title|`|QZ82tpNiaa	If you just abandon it the cc will have the cops tow it away. Once it is in their custody, you will probably ge ta letter telling you where it is and what you have to pay if you want it back. I would call a local junk yard and sell it for scrap instead of having it impounded. State laws vary and I cannot say you won't have to pay a fine if it gets towed as an abandoned vehicle. If you scrap it, they will pick it up and give you money, not much but usually between $50 and $100. Better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|5b07fe2bc3658ceccab9ea6537098f32aa	leave it they will tow it the tow company will sell it after a while been there

Seriously. Let's say I totally agree with you, and that your coworker will be fine, and everything will work out.    And I'm wrong.    Then what?    What good does our opinion do? Only thing that matters, is what will actually happen between your coworker and that other driver.    And NONE of us can guess that. We're not fortune tellers.
