20090128201504AA5ovhp	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What are your donut recipes?	I have a quick and easy... soooo quick and easy donut recipe i'd like to share:      1 cup of flour   1 cup of sugar, mix in a little powedered sugar too (to taste)   add a pinch of baking powder   about 1/4 cup of milk or water will do too      then mix it all in. The dough should be thick and sticky and taste it to make sure it's sweet enough. Then you can either let it sit for a while (some ppl say that letting it sit for hours will give the flour a chance to rise and therefore, your donuts will come out more puffy). If you don't have time, you can fry them right away too. You'll need to deep fry them. Drop half spoonfuls into the hot oil and try to get the dough as round as you can (you can make it in whatever shape you want, but the dough is not too cooperative so it's easiest to just keep them round-ish). After you have a few in, turn the oil down to a low temperature. This will allow the insides to cook but it really doesn't take long at all to fry. Take them out when they are a golden brown. They will come out the size of timbits or a little bigger. You can sugar them and eat. They're simple and good.      So what is your donut recipe?

It is all I have right now.. but I can live with out if for my calorie intakes' sake. Thank you.

I am sleeping over my friend's house Friday night with 6 other girls to celebrate her birthday, but as a vegan I don't know what to do. I think her parents are planning on feeding us pizza, so I think I might have to bring my own food. The dilemma is that her parents are very religious, as in, they take the bible seriously. They think God put animals on this earth for us to eat, and I don't want to spend my night explaining myself to them. I am afraid to tell them I am vegan because they might not want their daughter to be my friend anymore, which would be very inconvenient.      And, if i bring my own food I am afraid I might offend them. I can't expect them to cater to my special needs, so what do I do? Suggestions? Help? Miracles?

I didn't know, he offered me candy, and I put it in my mouth, and chewed a couple of times, this was early in the morning, around 10:30 am, but I spat it out. I rinsed my mouth with water, and kept spitting. Would there be any problems associated with this? Please don't call the boy bluff, I'm sure he did rub it.
