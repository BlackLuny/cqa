20090129084214AA8aEQ7	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Help with bad landlord...?	Ok here's the situation...   first problem we had with him was when I started babysitting, which he gave me written permission for. When I began with my first kids it was nearing winter and we pay $50 extra on our rent for use of half the garage. He boarded us out of the garage completely, when we asked why he first avoided us then said something was stolen (a drill). Ok he's all over the house doing work because it is relavitely new and he wanted to add a porch and other things like that so he could have misplaced it, another thing is he leaves the garage door open all fall and anyone could have walked in. When I told him we do not steal he changed his story and said it is because I started babysitting and he wanted to compensate for that. So we started paying another $50 a month for me babysitting and got the garage back.    Next when winter hit for some reason our bedroom was freezing like if no heat was in the room at all and our bedroom door is always open. I brought it to his attention 2 times and he said that it is impossible because he put something around the windows and he refused to check it out. The kind of heat we have comes through the floor. Around 2 months later he came down and asked if we were warm enough, by this time we had bought a space heater in order to sleep at night. So I told him again that the bedroom is too cold and we had to get a space heater. He pays the electric bill and he said he doesnt want us using it b/c it is 3 times more expensive. A couple hours later he came back down and said our room should warm up now b/c the pipes are getting warm. And that night it was warm but it only lasted about a week then started freezing again.    Now he is accusing us of using the electric heater more, which we are not (only when our 2 year old is getting out of the bath, then it's off again), and he is trying to make us pay $50 because his electric bill was over $100. In our contract he pays electricity. I don't know why he's acting this way I want to move before he finds out I'm pregnant because then he'll probably charge another $50, but we can't afford much more and this place is cheap compared to what else is out there...How do we handle this?

Since it is my last semester, I have exponged all of my financial aid sources.  My credit is not great due to some mistakes that I made with some credit cards a long time ago, so I cannot get a loan from a bank.  I have no family, and my friends are all students, so I cannot get the money that way.  I have a car, but it's a 95 civic, and the title loan place will not give me a loan on it.  I could pawn my computer, but I need it for my school work.  I am in desperate need of the $1200 fast.  I have $900 to my name which will all be going towards my tuition.  I start my paid internship the 23rd of February, so I would be able to pay the money back quickly.  I am in the Hampton Roads section of Virginia, so any ideas you have would be greatly appreciated!  I cannot afford to get dropped from my classes this close to graduation, and paying back a loan shark that amount of money, even with an extremely high interest rate would beat losing my diploma.

20090129091719AAccVWQ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	INFJ: Nursing/Psychology?	Which is a better suited career for an INFJ: Nursing, or a career in Psychology/Psychiatry? I like working by myself, very quiet, think a lot, love helping people and taking care of people, want to travel and help people in poor countries. I took psychology courses in first year, but my marks were a lil lower to make the Psych program. So I'm thinking about majoring in Philosophy (which I also like) and I have the marks to do so and then apply for med sch lateron to go into Psychiatry or apply into an M.A Psych program (if I change my mind about med sch). I'm just torn. I know it's hard and competitive to get into med sch and Psych Programs, so I do not want to set my hopes up. I already have $15,000 in student loans. 21. I'm just trying to make the right choice. I know nursing is a very broad field and there're many areas to go into, so I'll likely find an area that'll suit me. Should I just do that? Nursing sch is tough, but I know I'l be able to help people and that's my ultimate goal.

20090129093748AA3ZrnF	Business & Finance;Credit	Credit Card Law: Can my business charge our customers right away if we can't ship for some time?	I have a business that delivers perishable merchandise to our customers.        During certain times of year, depending on extreme temperatures, we may be unable to ship the merchandise until the weather falls within a certain window.  This necessitates us holding orders on some occasions for months at a time.  Our customers are well aware of this.      The current system we have in place for our online orders (credit cards) has us not charging the customer until we ship the order.  We simply keep the order on hold from the time they place the order, then we charge their card when we are ready to ship.      My question is: Based on California Law and Federal Law, is it legal to charge the customer's credit card right away if we are unable to ship their order until a later time so long as they are aware of the time it might take to ship their order?
20090129090035AAAunIu	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Fired....Not......WHAT IS GOING ON???	I am a senior in high school. Last April I got a job at a small sandwich shop. Everything was going great, got through the summer with no incident. The schedule runs by monthly. Well I hurt my knee august and had knee surgery. I informed my boss about and he was fine with letting me off until it healed. I talked to him every month and we resorted to putting me back on in december 1. December rolls around I still am not on the schedule, my doctor didn't release me yet. I talk to him and we decide on January. Okay. I get my work release and he puts me on the schedule for the last week in january. Okay. Great. Well a girl from school works there as well, and tells me that my name had been scratched off. I called my boss that day and asked him why I was taken off the schedule. He immediatly asked me why I wasn't at the store meeting, I told him I had no notification of it *The last meeting they called me and said there was a meeting*. He said that I needed to keep in touch with him from now on. He was working on the schedule and I should call him back. I called back later that day, I needed a few days off due to stock shows, got his voicemail and left a message. I called the store yesterday and asked the girl from school if I was on the schedule and she said no. Does this mean I am fired? Do I have any legal rights here? What do ya'll think. Thanks in advance.

20090129093823AAnhePl	Business & Finance;Investing	How Do I Find A Real Estate Investment "Silent" Partner?	I have had great success investing in houses in the Atlanta, GA market.  The last two houses I purchased, I bought for less than 50% of their appraised value.  I have always gotten a 75% mortgage after doing minor repairs which has given me cash at closing and still have a 25% equity stake in the rental property.  However, lenders are now limiting the number of rental properties one person can borrow against to only 4 properties.  Since I already have more than four, I need a partner who is interested in getting the mortgage in their name.  I would do all the work (finding the house, fixing it up, and getting a renter) and give up 25% of the profits.  How can I find people who might be interested in this type of investment partnership?  Are there investment inquiry sites on the internet?

20090129090636AAcVyvs	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Are they stringing me along? - HR, job offer?	I did a screening phone interview and then 4 phone interviews with managers at a company I really like back in mid-December. The HR rep told me after these initial interviews that she'd like to have me come in for a final interview BUT I am not a local candidate (I live several states away) so she'd have to get approval to pay for my travel (something the company never does.. they always hire local). I had to wait about two looong weeks for the travel approval. I flew to the city, did my final interviews on January 11, and filled out a simple application. The application did not ask for my social security number.. it was incredibly basic. On January 13, the HR rep contacted me, said I did fantastic during my interviews, told me that there are two open positions and 5 candidates, said I was one of the most experienced candidates, said they still had to finish a few more final interviews and then would contact me with updates, and then asked for my references. I provided her with 6 references (all of whom absolutely loved working with me), and that was the last I heard from her. It is now January 29, she hasn't checked any of my references, and she won't respond to my e-mails or voicemails asking for updates on the status of the position.      What I'm asking is... is this common practice for HR managers? I just graduated college, so I'm new to job searching. I understand that they hadn't finished with final interviews with everyone when I was contacted on January 13. However, if everyone is local, it seems odd that it would take this long to schedule and conduct the remaining interviews.      Is it possible that she extended offers to other candidates and is waiting for their decision (and is thus ignoring my e-mails and calls so that she can string me along and use me as backup)? Is that common for HR reps to do?

Addendum said that contract has to be fully executed/signed and returned back to us from seller for it to be effective . We are hoping that we will get it back tomorrow . Addendum had verbiage in it indicating that we are buying property in 'As-Is' condition and sellers will not do any fixes etc ....      Anyways when we had received addendum/contract and signed it gave it to them all appliances were there . But we checked last evening and looks like all appliances are gone from the property now except for a double oven ? Can seller do that ?

20090129103644AAT87Gi	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Post-It Confetti all over my boss. Trouble ensues?	Last week was my boss' birthday. I spent 3 whole days at work cutting up all the office post-its with a pair of scissors. I had enough to fill up an entire gallon.       On his birthday I sneaked up behind him and dumped the entire gallon all over him (I made sure to swish it all through the air so they were flying around for a nice effect).       They went in his hair and eyes and mouth and clothes, in his bag, in his desk drawers, and even went into his computer. I guess the problems started when they went into the computer. The next day the computer started making strange noises and overheating, then a cloud of something came out the back, and the computer stopped working altogether. IT cannot fix it.      Now my company wants to garnish my wages to pay for the computer and they want me to clean up the mess (the cleaning people got mad when they saw it and refused to clean it up, WTH???) They are also saying that I wasted company time because I spent 3 days cutting up Post-Its instead of actually working & they want to take away 3 of my vacation days.      They have no right to do this to me! I personally feel that this is entirely my boss' fault, since he is my supervisor & he was clearly not supervising me at all. What can I do?

I have no intent on going to school forever so professional school is out of the question as is law school.  What undergraduate or masters degree will yield me the best chance at a good first job with little to no experience?  Thank you.

If you've resat a GCSE (in just one subject), is it fine to include the new grade from the resit on a CV? My other GCSEs are very good, but I sort of messed up Maths. But I'm worried that if I went for a job and an employer wanted to see a certificate (it's a seperate one for the original sitting and resit) it'd look a bit suspect if I had put the re-sat grade on my CV when it's of course different on the original certificate.

I recently bought home electronics from CC, with their "no interest until sometime in 2010" promotion. They keep changing my due date from month to month, so it's not always the same day every month, sometime it is 3 days or so earlier. This time I forgot about it and didn't pay it until 3 days after it was due, but still before the same day of last month it was due last time. Does anyone know if this is going to make the account be considered in default so they can add all the accrued interest because of this small slip caused by their due-date "trick", or does it require a minimum of 2 late payments before they do that? Has anyone run into this before? I don't have the account terms available so I can't read it right now. The next statement hasn't closed yet. I checked my account, it had a late fee of it already, but no deferred interest added yet, and the overall interest rate was also still the same. The late fee is ok, and I already paid the balance due for this statement. Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience, and if they are going to look over if it's just once and is paid immediately after a few days.      Thanks

20090128093313AAYh8aj	Business & Finance;Credit	I have a question about paying off credit cards?	I got a credit card a couple years ago and had $2,000 put on it to use for school only. However, I have $94 to use. I just made a payment of $86. Work has been kind of slow lately, so I haven't been working as much, plus I am trying to get through school. The only thing else I have to pay for is my cell phone bill. I only have been using my credit card for school, but every now and than have cheated and used it for other things. As long as I stay on the plus side, can I continue to use my credit card, if I keep paying the minimal balance when it's due. I've been able to pay it off every time. Now, since things are slow at work, I'm not making as much money, and need to use credit card for a car inspection and stuff like that.

I moved to a new city to work there, got an apt., etc. The position was a new change for the agency and they informed me they would need time to sort things out but I would begin training Januaray 14th and would be able to start by the 21st.      I attended three trainings and my Jan. 21st start date was pushed back to the 26th. Although I was frustrated, I understood the difficulties with the transition. I then recieved a phone call the Friday before I was supposed to start stating that my start date would now be on Feb. 2nd.      I called my supervisor today to verify the Feb. 2nd start date and she notified me that she was not 100% certain that would work yet-- that they were working on referrals (I'm a social worker-- they are in the process of changing the system for cases, etc.) and they want me in on the 2nd but she would have to check on that date.      I'm currently waiting to hear back-- i've been living in the city for over a month with NO job and can simply not afford to keep waiting for my start date to begin. Should I give up and start looking for another job?!

20090128092414AAE9akB	Business & Finance;Advertising & Marketing;Search Engine Optimization	Question on Seo techniques?	Does anyone happen to know if there is software which tells you how much a link is worth on any given site where your site is placed.       So for example if a site had 25 links on the page and you placed a link of there site pointing back to yours, anchored keywords, would there be software to tell you the point value of that link?      Say for instance I posted in a forum and asked a question which I know nobody would know the answer to, in my sig I placed my link back to my site. Would this give my link more weight because of lack of responses as opposed to possible links under people sigs when people reply.       So because the forum thread has not had any replies surely this would give my link more priority in relation to points?      Or are sites where you place your links based on the number of links on the overall site rather than the area of posting your link, the page basically.      Once again thanks for any information :)

20090128091304AAJkTrZ	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	How does Obama's stimulus plan affect the first-time home buyer's tax credit?	There is a lot of conflicting information about how exactly Obama's stimulus plan will affect the first-time home buyer's tax credit passed last year.  Some state the requirement to repay the $7,500 credit will be removed, some state it will only be removed for houses purchased in 2009.        I bought my house in May of 2008, if the stimulus passes, will I have to pay back the $7,500 tax credit?  I really think it would be unfair to those of us that bought in 2008, who now owe more than we paid, to have to pay it back.        If we do have to pay it back, I'm not going to spend a dime of that money.  I will put it all in a Roth IRA (contributions spread out a couple of years) and never touch it.  This really isn't going to do much for the economy.  If I don't have to pay it back, I will spend every dime of it on things like furniture, new windows, and a privacy fence.      To summarize my question, if you bought a house within the current tax credit window in 2008, will Obama's stimulus plan remove the requirement to pay back the $7,500 credit?

I have looked on the HSBC website, but there is nothing about these new cards on there. She asked a cashier at her branch to explain, and was told they didn't know anything about it.     What is going on? It's taken us years to persuade her to use a card instead of a chequebook, and now they do this. Will it be used the same as a Visa card and they'll slam the interest on if she doesn't pay at the end of the month? She's never had a Credit Card and certainly doesn't want one at her age.    Thanks

20090128103818AAzSPIn	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I need immediate help! I had a baby in June of 2008....?	She was born premature and had to be held in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unite for a week. I couldn't imagine the price I had to pay after it all until I received a bill recently. I received two different bills, one for about $19,000 and the other for $46,000. I thought maybe this is just a copy of what the Insurance wants me to have to show the amount they have taken care of it. It turns out that this is all a balance that I owe out of my pocket. Im assuming this because on the very bottom of the itemized invoice it says "Blue cross PPO Deductible" and amount next to it that said $30,000. Im assuming this is the portion they were responsible for and the bill I received was all for me to pay on my own. I need HELP! I don't know what to do, as I cannot afford such a large sum. I don't know what to do, Im sure this will go into collections. Will they start to garnish my wages? Should I file Bankruptcy? Im 23 years old and need some guidance. Can anyone help, Please?

20090128115545AARdL1Q	Business & Finance;Credit	Will my husband's poor judgement ruin my credit too?	Both my husband and I have good credit (both between 710-760 depending on which one you look at).  He and his ex-wife own a condo, and just recently she has talked about renting it out (his name and his ex-wife's son's names are on the loan...and the son and my husband are not related).  She gets a say in this because at the moment in time, the son is in prison and she has power of attorney.      I just found out that the potential renters are none-too-trustworthy in my opinion (there would be 2 adults--women who are friends-- and 3 children in a ONE bedroom condo!  plus they have no cars, and the ex-wife knows them through the son currently in prison).        I can't talk my husband out of this.  I am worried that when they stop paying rent (and I'm sure they will), his credit might be hurt (due to communication between everyone involved).  I've even asked that his ex-wife buy him out if she wants to do this, but she doesn't have the money to do that, and he won't push the issue.      Now, my question is: if his credit is hurt through all of this, can mine be hurt too since we are married?  My name is not in or on any of this, so it won't hurt me directly, but will it hurt me indirectly through my husband?

Journalism- I have a very presentable personality. I am not very worldly wise and my GQ isnt that great..but I think it would be fun to write, edit, (editor) and maybe someday do some broadcast journalism or a production for news channels eg documentaries etc..what do you think. Please give me the lowdown on this and what I need to do from here ..      MBA in Media Management. Maybe will again lead to journalism? and I will have to take the GMAT...      MS IN Journalism?      Nutrition? Cons are 4 yrs of study and not knowing whether I will love it ..   Physical Therapist?      Psychology? I am a little psycho myself and am scared of delving into the human mind though and five yrs of study will be a lot of work      Anything else short, powerful and non-boring?      I always thought the medical field would have been one interesting career..but I blew my chances when there was time and now I dont want to take the USMLE , pre-requisites and then study 8 yrs and start work at 40...well...so please no suggestions about this lost friend..

I know that as an hourly employee, any work beyond 40 hours in a single work week counts as overtime.  My question is really about how much work beyond those 40 hours counts as overtime.  I work in IT and sometimes answer calls via my cell phone on Saturdays, which is outside my normal working hours.  The calls usually only last for two or three minutes, and I get maybe ten calls on an average Saturday.  The problem is that my employer tells me that only continuous work in excess of seven minutes is compensatory time.  In other words, if I get a call that lasts three minutes, and then an hour later get another call that lasts three minutes, I wouldn't get paid for either of those calls.  I'm told that it only counts as overtime if a single call lasts longer than seven minutes or if I get back-to-back calls that total more than seven minutes.  Is this true?!

My story is that i have a 4000 dollar credit card which is at 22% rate...Im having a hard time cutting it down so the bank gave me a option to refinance my 20,000 dollar car which is at 10% rate and will jump to 15 % rate when refinanced but they will give me a 4000 dollar check to pay off my credit card.

20090128102145AAsXY8d	Business & Finance;Credit	How to go about filing a judgement against a friend/business partner?	I entered into a partnership with a friend of many years.  We purchased a house together, in my name because my credit was the best at the time.  The arrangement was that he would front any money needed at close and the first few months mortgage payments.  After a few months seasoning on the property, we were going to sell the property to him and release me from the partnership along with a few bucks for the transaction.  Well, after 3 months of ownership, he said his credit wasn't ready and that he wanted to refinance the home and give me a larger cut to hold on to it for a few more months.  At the time it sounded good, so I agreed.  We received $113000 + from the refinance, then I gave him about $85K in order to season the money for the purchase.  2 months later he had stopped coming around and wasn't answering my phone calls.  I got him to give me another 10k in order to make payments and so on, but he said that he had run into some issues and that he would get me the rest of the money if he could be out of the deal.  Another month passed by and I finally got a hold of him again, he had spent all the money on a loft downtown's mortgage and lending money to his family.  Anyways, the total comes to over 80K that he owes plus some in my opinion.  Guess I'm wondering what I need to do in order to get something so that the money will be paid back at some point in my lifetime.  I have emails showing he admits to owing the money, but no official contract on our partnership.  I also have several witnesses if need be that will testify on my behalf.  Any advise??

Our bank puts us on the back burner and doesnt seem inclined to listen. I brought our financial makeup to Billcut.com and after reviewing have told us we are qualified for their mortgage modifcation services. they go through our bank and push them better than the basic consumer.       YOu see ads for these places all over, some are legit and some are scams for your money. All of these services cost money, after all you are paying someone to get the job done.      My question is simple. Websites and BBB aside, has anyone had any dealings with Billcut who can share their experiences both positive and negative, to give me reassurance that I am not being taken for a ride. So far they are living up to what they say, but of course I am always the sceptical homeowner.      Thanks

I came to know that fact only after 1 1/2 years.  When I went back to my former employer,  they are saying that the money has been accounted for and hence, I need to work with the payroll service (ADP) who processed my payroll.  When I contacted ADP, they are asking me to go back to my former employer, since ADP can not discuss any payroll related things to any body except the employer (and their authorized representative).        I feel like I am being pushed pillar to pillar.  Is there any other way for me to get back my money?      Any advice/idea will be really appreciated

About me: I am currently doing owner financing on a property that my tenant wants to purchase. He has great income but his credit is not the best. The property is being sold for $85,000 and he is providing $21,000 down in cash. What I have yet to figure out is what is a good (favorable to me) interest for me to charge? I know people with poor credit usually get charged a higher interest rate but can you suggest the norm and the highest (I can consider) interest rate to charge this person. Thanks for any help!! Oh yeah, the property is in Upstate NY and single family. Also he wants to purchase a second property I have and am also willing to do owner finance on (probably will sell for $68,000).

20090128115954AAXyfY0	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is this a good time to purchase a home?	I keep hearing that this is a buyers market and that if you are able and have the desire to do so, you should purchase your home now. I get that.      But my question... is this a good time for ME to purchase a home. I know NOTHING about the process. I talked to a realtor yesterday, who set me up with a banker, whom I talked with today, and he took all my information and is going to get back with me. I'm not even sure what he's going to get back with me on though. I'm guessing it's to get pre-qualified? I'm not even sure what all that means.   The realtor wants me to call him back once I get more information from the banker. But then what? We go look at houses?       One bank I spoke with (my bank actually) said that I would have to have 3% of the entire purchase price upfront, AND would also have to have 4-6k upfront for closing costs. She said it would end up being about ten thousand up front that I would need. The realtor has assured me this is not the case, and that my bank is just nit picky on how they lend their money.       So that's where I'm at in the process I guess. But here's the thing. I don't know how much money I SHOULD have saved up or what else I should do at this point. My car will be paid off next week (once I get my income tax refund, which I'm scheduled to get on Feb 3rd) and I will have about $1643 leftover (plus about $600 I already have saved) and so I could technically stay where I'm at and save the $350 a month I'm no longer having to put out on my car.       But I HATE my apartment. My neighbors are horribly rude and to be honest, I'm just tired of putting money into something I'm never going to own. Plus - I have an almost 2 year old who LOVES being outside. There isn't a single patch of grass in my complex. You step outside my apartment, and you're literally in the road. So I have many reasons for wanting a house.      But my mom keeps reminding me that I am single. I don't have anyone or anything to depend on. And if something goes wrong, I have nobody to help me financially. (Which.. let's face it, I have the exact same thing to worry about being in my apartment.. if I lose my job or something like that, I'm in the exact same boat essentially - either way I wouldn't have the money to pay my rent/mortgage). I understand what she means though. With a house.. there is more responsibility. No calling the complex handyman to come fix something. But I know many people who do home repair stuff just for fun, and they would help so long as I paid for materials, just because that's what they like doing in their spare time.      Okay.. this is getting long.      Anyone have any advice!???       How much money should one have saved up prior to purchasing a home?

20090128122944AAL4WP5	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Home Loan (FHA) Question Please Help!!!?	Hello,      We have just spoken with a loan rep and found out thanks to my credit score the only loan we would possibly be able to qualify for is the FHA loan.       So we gave them our information. I make an avg of a bit over 30,000 (past 2 years) and my boyfriend made an avg of 29,000 base (last 2 years) and had switched positions (from customer service to sales) about 18 monsth ago. This new position guarantees him commission of approx 2000 a month. It is a guarantee because he works with inhouse pre-existing accounts. What his job calls Sales is more along the lines of Account Management... since he is not out in Field sales as most people consider a position in sales to be.       Now after we spoke with the loan rep we were told that the 24000 he made inthe last year and the 12000 he made the last 6 months of 2007 can not be counted in the income because he has not been making commission for a full 2 years. Even though we provided all 18 months of his commission check stubs.      Is that true?      DO they not count anything that you have done for less then 2 years?       I thought that what they do is take everything you made in the last 2 years and divided it by 2 and considered what you made for the past 2 years the average. Why would they say you can not use the commission since he only has made it for the past 18 months? That to me doesnt exactly make sence or sound right.         ALSO the guy then said that we can not qualify for a specific house we had used as an example...when we asked to be PRE-qualified... so all we want is to know the number for which we can get a loan for. Then he told us to put in an offer and the pay to get it inspected and pay to get it appraised and then he could see if he could push it forward.       How if he can't give us a number can we put in an offer?       And who in their right mind would pay for things when there is a good chance they wont get the  house and then they would be out the money?      Please help.
