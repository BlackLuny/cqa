4vQZ3kv7aa	I would highly recommend www.justinguitar.com. I started at the very beginning of January (2009.) and already know a lot (for free!) considering that I started with absolutely no knowledge. Justin (the one that teaches on the website) is very funny and happy to help, has experience, really knows what he is talking about and teaches very useful stuff in a very comprehensive way. When I got the guitar and bought a tutorial book I thought: "no!". There was too much of everything. As I started learning with his website, I stopped reading gossip in the internet as the time spent on playing guitar with his website seemed to be too attractive to leave it for gossips and rubbish.     When you try the site (do it!) remember to donate as this is the only way Justin can keep improving the site!|`|m25lpepOaa	There are many people that teach guitar online. If you go to www.youtube.com and search for "guitar lessons", you will probably find man results of people that start teaching from the very basics, such as simply holding the guitar in the right position. It is also completely free to view these tutorial videos.    Good luck with learning :)|`|t2SGVG1Vaa	I taught myself to play guitar when I was around 11...my advice would be just to look up guitar tabs of songs you like and learn them. You might be crappy at the beginning, but struggle through them, and it will get much easier :]    And it will make you feel special that you know how to play an actual song instead of just random chords and scales.    A good tab site is www.ultimate-guitar.com  [if you don't know how to read tab, it is pretty straightforward/easy and you could look up how to do it on google]    Good luck :D|`|sLzuJWWvaa	Check out Expert village you can learn almost anything there    http://www.expertvillage.com/search.htm?...    good luck|`|fRdzs3Dnaa	Learn major,minor and blues scales.Just google these and learn them.Also learn chords - major,minor,7ths. Just do it!    Use your ear as well!|`|36aPSk4oaa	justinguitar.com   he's the best on the net.

AA12400627	Hang in there and don't let something as insensitive as that get you down. Now is the time for you to find whatever little joy you can find in your life....    My grandfather had lung cancer and we tried our best to make it as fun as we could for him....no matter what day it was, we would make time for him everyday. Whether it was to walk with him to the park or just sit around and watch traffic....whatever brought a smile to his face....    When life seems gloomy, there's always a ray of sunshine out there trying to beam through.....I am sorry for your condition and more sorry that someone would go around and report questions without a care that it may be a serious question!    It happens a lot here, but just know that there those who do care! Put a smile back on your face and don't ever give up hope....as long as you are alive, there is hope! Don't look at the end, but look forward to each day, taking it one step at a time.....always be grateful for the little things, the good things, and most important of all....for those that are dear to your heart!     You are loved and you should know that somewhere out there, someone is smiling at you and happy that you made it another day (=    Take Care and may you find peace in a chaotic world!|`|EJ3oiAo5aa	Try to enjoy each moment to the best of your ability,that's all you can do!|`|SAceGS46aa	Your name is anonymous, i think we all know why your question was deleted.|`|KpZBscNnaa	Sorry about the question being deleted.

I remember when my dog was dying someone deleted my question. And then after she passed away, I was really upset and that question got deleted too. It's amazing how rude and careless people can be on here. I was upset too. :(   But please don't commit suicide. I'm really sorry that you have lung cancer. If you ever need to talk to someone just please email me! Please, Please, don't commite suicide.|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	They probably think you're making it up.     If you really do have lung cancer, I am sooo sorry.  Go out and live your life, don't waste it on Y/A!      may god bless you|`|0L2Un19raa	your not alone.  im so there.  i hate everyone saying stuff like "go get help" and "stop, your only hurting yourself".  the only reason im still here is because i want to make something of myself and get away from all the total a.holes. around me.   just sit and think. i know when i do i instantly start crying.  just ask yourself what you think you should do.  don't listen to all that religion crap.|`|3GMwtIn5aa	I'm sorry.

Unless you are too ill to do that.  I don't know your situation. Just make the best of your life.|`|ERRkUmWvaa	Because there are many idiots out there who report every question they don't agree with, they think that no matter what life is a gift and no one has any right to take it away from themselves so matter how much they are suffering which is sick.

They didn't want to give him a specific ethnicity like Russian, Jewish, Italian, etc.|`|8JFMEtTEaa	Idk, Italian lol.|`|TJSjJ0juaa	XD  this is creative!|`|AAgX0SDcaa	The company had a contest several years ago, they wanted photos of men whom they could use for a model for the  "new" Mr. Clean. A fireman in my city won the contest and won  $15,000 prize and a trip. He is caucasian american. He isn't bald, but they took his hair off in the pics because Mr. Clean is traditionally bald. Mr. Clean products are widely used in Morocco, when I went there and mentioned that the real model was living in my city, they told me no, and think they were thinking he was middle-eastern. He kind of looks like a genie.|`|9SHaFZyOaa	German?|`|LfT3s05Faa	Who cares!?

xeYNNoxfaa	It's true we do have a percentage of the population who are obese, but in general we are not a fat country. There's a definite correlation between education, wealth, and fitness levels. The demographics are irrefutable... sadly if you study the fattest states, you will find that they also have the highest poverty levels and the lowest levels of education.    It may be that with a better education and job, the quality of food afforded increases. Also, those with a higher income are more likely to have more discretionary funds to invest in a gym and have more time to devote to fitness.     Another huge problem, is that a large portion of the population lives on fastfood. People here are finally starting to realize that you can't eat ANY fastfood and be healthy. Furthermore,  the additives and hormones in meat etc. are another issue. Once again you run into the problem of food costs, as organic meat & produce costs sometimes 3 times more.    In addition, it would help tremendously if the US FDA followed the UK's lead and banned Fructose Corn Syrup from food products; thus far, the lobbyists in Washington have not let that happen. In my opinion, that would be the first step toward making the US a healthier country.|`|n1y67ZNuaa	America did hold the record of most obese people.  But according to new research studies, AUSTRALIA has taken over by a few percent and is still rising. I live in Australia and its so sad to see how alot of people are obese and unhealthy looking. But i guess thats what happens when you eat to much crap, and dont do enough excersize.|`|HFEotT1Qaa	It is...    McDonald's and not practicing self-restraint.

I resemble that remark...LOL|`|S4CXs5qbaa	yes, we're a nation full of chubby fat@sses....  fast food restaurants...restaurants around every corner....sitting on our butts way more than we excercise, finding excuses not to shed a few pds, justifying it by saying we're too busy|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Lack of exercise and fast food. I spent a good amount of time in the UK and I saw just as many obese people there as I do in America. Sorry, your theory is wrong.|`|9dtrWO5laa	yes it is true, but I heard that there are really obese people in the UK too, don't know if that is true or not..|`|hJHl4HmSaa	It's true, but only because we have the most OLD PEOPLE.    I'm an American and I stay between 90-100 pounds. I know only 1 obese person that isn't old. She's only obese due to a health problem.      Don't believe everything that you read on the internet (except this)|`|8D8ck9pVaa	i live in the UK  and there are loads of obese people here too. I expect we are all slipping into bad habits like eating mcdonalds and not moving around    COOR WE ARE ALL LITTLE FATTIES

Ten years ago I was very lost, wandering aimlessly through life without a purpose. I was also depressed and miserable. In a way I ended up where I started. I was in college working on my psych major.

Hopefully within that ten-year window I'll be happily settled into my career as a counseling psychologist. :o)

The Genetic Opera, because there's singing.    And if you're feeling masochistic, watch the Spice World or Glitter or something horrible like that.

6N428aG4aa	Ok, MOST cereal commercials do not involve stealing. I can think of those 4. There was the cookie crook, but he is gone. We have Barney taking fred's cereal of course. Then there is the Trixx guy and the lucky charms thing. No one ever said someone stole the fruit loops.    I never saw anyone steal corn flakes or cheerios. I Most assuredly never saw anyone try to steal special K either.   The commercials are trying to be clever and funny, but they are not.  It is also not a good thing that most are aimed at children, because the message is not a good one.|`|kR6hptDvaa	yes................It's really fun|`|hUYaaXBvaa	your right  lucky charms  that trix rabbit  i don't think frootloops does though or cheerios with that bee  i think its just to emphasize that their products are want-able|`|hJHl4HmSaa	Very much so.      You see, when the cereal companies banded together in 1976 to create the "CCFSA", they made up a contract. It stated that we must incourage the children of the world to dress up like homosexual rabbits and steal things.|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	Because everyone has to have there Trix/Fruity Pebbles, even though they can just go to a store and buy them|`|CdTe8MO4aa	i thought it was normal to go to my neighbor's house to eat there cereal  lol|`|aqLDMy2Maa	they are trying to steal you away from your favorite cereal brand.  maybe subliminal.|`|V4BSfZzWaa	what?

ZyGyDLsDaa	They die, but it's symbolic that they will stay together forever. I'm not sure if I'm expressing myself clearly. People often exaggerate that they are "dying of love". This takes it to that step, but the film has such unreal touches, that it could be actually symbolic~that they would die to be together.     I found this review at IMDb that expresses much better what I tried but failed to say clearly. Forgive me, but it's after 3 a.m., and I am somewhat groggy:  With a last "cap/pas cap" they both accept ("cap!") for a last time to conclude their game while descending into a pit soon to be filled up with concrete; it seems that French cinema usually ends a love story with both characters willingly dying together (see "Jules et Jim" or "Mayerling"). This final scene was for me the most disturbing,and probably it is so even to a viewer with macabre/dark tastes and/or least instinct of self-preservation. Later on, I realized that it was surrealistic, fairly impossible off screen; There are several construction-workers shown while deliberately pouring concrete on them when, in real life, a worker who would do that would lose his job and be charged with murder. Though at first I was unconsciously appalled (heck, damned instinct named above!), I then realized that the scene was rather symbolical than a true outcome. Being also named "Love Me If You Dare", this film is a metaphor about the price and rewards of love; in love, one must dare to accept every challenge, even death, to eventually find fulfillment.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  That says it much better than my stumbling words. I guess I could have said that they don't actually die though it would look that way on the screen. (I really do need to get some sleep! *giggle*)

nqggTf1Oaa	Both Mildred Kemp AND the "dads new girlfriend" had there own pearl necklaces.     The new girlfriend wasnt bad in the movie at all, it was all in the girls (anna's) head, and she ended up killing the new girlfriend.    About the Necklace:  When anna reads about a family that Mildred Kemp killed, she see's the picture of the mother and she is wearing a pearl necklace, which looks exactly the same as the one that "dads new girlfriend" has. This then gives Anna more of a reason to believe that she is a killer, but she just had a pearl necklace, adn she wasnt the killer.    In the end, the necklace that mildred is holding right before she closes the door is NOT the same necklace. It is just showing that she had the necklace the whole time, and that the person is in fact Mildred Kemp. So I think they just do that so you know that the necklace that "dads new girlfiend" had was NOT the one from the family that was killed.    They did not own the same necklace, they each had there own, but when Anna saw that the other familys mohter had the necklace, she thought it was the same. Then, in the end, she sees the necklace and the door (which said Mildred Kemp) and she knew that the new GF was not a killer.)    Sorry, im bad at explaing things, :P.|`|LIe2yMguaa	Idk the ending was really confusing! Like was the stepmom really bad, or was it just the girl all a long?

YYuXz88laa	I went to a very special Coldplay gig a few years ago, and even though my feeling for the band have waivered in past years, this is stioll the best gig experience of my life.    On the day of the release of their 3rd album X&Y, they held a very special gig for BBC Radio 1 at the intimate venue, Koko in Camden, London. The tickets went on sale at 9am that morning, and fans, including myself had been their for hours before hand, some since late afternoon the day before. we got the tickets, and had to wear a wristband all day, ready to come back that evening. The feeling of having got one of the very limited number of tickets, and wearing to college all day, was only bettered when that evening the band put on an AWESOME show, and showcased their material to a small audience of die-hard fans which included the Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake, and almost all fo the Radio 1 DJs who were working.

I'd rather date Scooby.|`|BGIsuNMTaa	Velma, shes brainy so would always get you out of a tricky situation whereas Daphne would run off so her hair didnt get ruined|`|AA10916001	Hubby says Velma because girls in glasses are wild in the sack.

sSdbfJpJaa	Tears by emotional stress clear one's choked heart whereas 'onion-tear' doesn't do so; rather it increases anger to the onion-family!|`|H5NVYoNOaa	tears by chopped onions are caused by a chemical reaction not emotion or stress|`|AA11894640	Tears are tears...they wet your cheeks and redden your eyes...and you have to blow your nose occasionally to stay clean!    Only difference is that you can avoid tears by soaking onion before chopping;  while emotional stress can leave you chopped & choked if you avoid tears...    Edit:  Dada,  choosing the right category is sometimes very important,  to get the right reactions/responses!  Polls & Surveys is farthest from Science...if you know what I mean!  Maybe you are new here but you are willing to learn that I can see!  Sorry to have let you down!|`|5ELpGvMKaa	Tears by emotional and stress: deep hurt felt in the center of your heart..  Tears by chopped onion:  deep hurt felt in your eyes.. : )

The rich smart ones are usually jerks...and the ones that are hell-bent on going to Harvard are jerks but I'm smart and I'm nice, people are always cheating off me tho -_-|`|k7jGZydJaa	Smart kids don't like me because I'm too easy going.    and I don't think they're nicer or meaner than the other kids, but they tend to be too competitive, and I don't like being around competitive people.|`|ipdM8Sefaa	i always found smarter kids nicer because some of the other ones would join rediculous 'cliques' in order to belong and just bully other kids.  but i'm just speaking from what went on in my school, yours is prob very different.

I went back the next day and helped them clean up.|`|FmucfdCEaa	Only one I stumbled upon, I didn't know them but they were too frenzied to even watch, I moved on when the opportunity presented itself.|`|1b99e2172d8e187dc1c01f1f61578326aa	No - maybe I haven't been to a wild enough party, but never met one *too* wild!|`|AA11713693	Not as yet.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	no I have not|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	Yes but it was years ago....I just got really drunk and joined in ;-)|`|dd7f6eb566c0d6a7067106dd5cbbc4e3aa	yeah.. i just left the party and went home

AA11514493	Voice mails are so passe..  I just call their computer..again and again and again..    Just wish SOMEBODY would 'pick up.'    SIGH!|`|vzWGml26aa	you have to fill it up until no more can get in.  that 311 is a problem|`|bHLCjPIHaa	i'd say about 3 but it depends on what you say, if you say i'm going to stalk you on the first message or something creepy like that i'd automatically consider them a stalker!  LOL =)|`|q3mLfg2yaa	well it really depends on the situation. 3 or 4 but no more than 5.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Now, wait a minute ! I've always answered ! What do you expect ? I have two kids and no life ! LOL !|`|m7nrQEflaa	4 or more in the same day...|`|783Ve5Pnaa	2. how many did you leave?|`|ENspyhzUaa	more than 3 messages and if that person isn't immediate family i think something is wrong...|`|xLO5VRYTaa	When they call you a stalker there's a slight chance you may be a stalker|`|1PGmB4JNaa	one :)|`|dw0Jl4SGaa	like maybe 3 or 4.  no more than 5.|`|FBywNyw8aa	3|`|AA12400627	Well judging from these answers, my exes were all stalkers! We're looking at 15 or more here! lol....and I am very bad about picking up the phone! I'm always out doing something more productive or I would rather be here answering your questions! :p|`|WhgxnKkjaa	depends on comments on voicemail and the number of times called  if based on number of calls 3 a day is too much 2 is alright because you might no be sure it got there and after the third day just give up|`|VSBVqfRCaa	more then 10|`|rU3H3EOzaa	As many as the guy I'm dating leaves on mine...If I go out to walk the dog,I come back and there's like 6 texts on my phone saying stuff like "where are you" "wtf why arent you picking up" all in caps... and 7-15 missed calls...If someone doesn't pick up It's not necessary to call back that many times in a row,just wait for them to call back...It makes you look stalkerish If you call anybody too much,regardless of whether you leave messages or not.

5ef5c0dcd63c743eb71140df1bc4b644aa	Speech in front of strangers. Done it a billion times plus thats what my job is all about.|`|mzhETLVDaa	I would love to fly in that plane and after the landing give a speech to people who are afraid to ride the plane and not to jump out when they are scared they will never be able to talk about it L O L|`|P2Txzhxnaa	jump out of an airplane|`|XdBlOEJLaa	Speech.

w63Ry3w4aa	Yes I tend to do that, and it's horrible but I just can't handle it......  Right now I've been depressed for a very long time....I'd say months, or maybe years without knowing it.  But I'm trying to change that because it's so frustrating, and I have a lot of mixed feelings inside, and sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode.....plus I'm too young.|`|htMOl3c4aa	Well being a guy I naturally do that and I guess I just don't explode. Even though I cried during this one movie. Haha don't tell anyone...|`|BWmSvTZ0aa	Yeah, I do.

I explode immediately...when I am angry.|`|iVC63zypaa	I do now ....     I have no idea how long. I've never done it before.|`|QKdpO2Wtaa	yeah|`|qhU3PDgfaa	before i use to do that a lot..and i use to explode only after getting drunk..    but recently..i try not to bottle up my feelings.. in some way or the other i take it out... :D|`|tkgvrqjHaa	bottle up   16 years, never blew it   i dont do that kid of stuff     if there is a problem   FIX IT|`|5ef5c0dcd63c743eb71140df1bc4b644aa	No way.

Look out for the day I eventually do :D|`|YnBdka6naa	I do. When someone pisses me off, I just use yelling at them a way of letting emotions out.|`|P2Txzhxnaa	No.

1YTmgAc3aa	Not really, I'm actually pretty stupid and slow when it comes to certain things..  In reality, everyone, as we all know, has a different approach of learning, and it varies among different people. The pace of learning something  is quite irrelevant, the important thing is that you manage to comprehened what you're learning, despite how fast or slow you seem..|`|xhz1kWroaa	No.  I take a long time to get something down pat in my mind.  It takes a lot of practice and time for me to learn how to do something.  It bugs me sometimes, but I just have to deal because that's just the way I am.|`|AA11263103	yes.|`|frwlypDWaa	    Y         YE    |`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	yes i am|`|KTtLYrcZaa	nope.. im slower than most people... :/|`|BWmSvTZ0aa	Eh...kinda?|`|783Ve5Pnaa	I am a faster learner that you|`|0cMVKUnAaa	Yeah|`|8VFKvFqPaa	yeah   and didnt u just ask another Q a minute ago???|`|ZnMLkSeQaa	i catch on pretty quick|`|bnGnE58zaa	yes|`|qhU3PDgfaa	hmm..kinda..    but not really that fast.. lol|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Yeah you could say that. lol|`|5ef5c0dcd63c743eb71140df1bc4b644aa	Yes mame!|`|IKs0my9aaa	I got a photographic memory|`|T6WYXtdfaa	Not really.|`|q6ogfhnMaa	yeah i am actually!|`|cNdkNYKOaa	sometimes  mostly depends on what i'm learning and how interesting it is to me|`|CpaagBzCaa	not really...  lol  @|`|MeOG2TPHaa	yes...quite fast..|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Mama always said I could do anything|`|G79EhPtsaa	Yes, if i'm interested.|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	I THInk I am a Wizard :-D|`|LgNqYUECaa	Yep, if the teacher is any good ;)|`|X7hm4fJXaa	Everybody has a different way of learning, some catch on really easy and the others dont. But just because you (if) are a slow learner, dosent make you dumb. its just that the most important part is how WELL you learn, not how fast.|`|ligmlWpgaa	depends.how fast is fast?|`|IVxPMLnTaa	lolz. only at interesting things. but like at school, im kinda slow.|`|yACXwSuhaa	I'm blond....I learn fast with things I like....|`|bgE2gRwSaa	If it's something I'm interested in I will devour it up instantly.....if it doesn't interest me I can gaurantee you I won't even bother trying to learn it.

I thought it was just my computer, or maybe both of our computers are stupid.|`|L6c4wPPGaa	That happens to me, too.  But not at the moment.    I think its just maybe the internet connection we have, because if it wasnt, everyone would experience.  What I do is just get off the comp?(Turn it off) And just stay off it for a bit, then when its back on, it is usually working again|`|mfwDnMupaa	I'll check!

This link will install a better flash player for you  Hope that helps
DzIlM76Xaa	I'm pretty sure I can't do any of those things. But I like that song kinda and wish I could.|`|hoZE1vi0aa	Well, I've drank beer that long...|`|lLN8VD20aa	I only plow fields when i sow diamonds ....  I catch catfish 24/7/365 at the supermarket ...  & I'm smoking  ....  hot when I drink whiskey .....   I drink in the Sauna|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Yes, I don't live in CO for nothing.|`|AA11514493	If yer talkin' in innuendo..then yes.  if not...are you crazy...  fish, sure...plowing fields is HARD work.  sheesh|`|cmw591woaa	i can do the catfishing but somebody has to take the fish off the hook. i hate that part.     and i could make my own smoke, but so far ,it's still illegal, so i don't.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	You know Lilbit back in the day we did have to ploy those fields and we weren't even allowed to use a ox either.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	No to all of the above.  My mother in law used to roll her own, though. lol|`|EOTH56DWaa	Yep. There ain't too many things this ole boy can't do...|`|fx6pNJ5saa	I also have a shotgun, a rifle, and a 4 wheel drive...hubby skins the bucks|`|2oGc1tuCaa	Is plowing a field all day a euphemism for sex?
KYndJ3Rpaa	3|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Too hard for me, I'm only 14 you know...!|`|IIdhUedsaa	i never heard of these type of equations to be honest|`|3rnMQW3Gaa	I'm only 13 (I take algebra), so I don't know if this is right, but I will show you my work.    square root of (x-2) - square root of (2x+3) = -2  (x-2) - (2x+3) = 4   x-2-2x-3 =4  -x-5=4  x=-9|`|WWlYETgHaa	The answer is 3. It also checks back in the equation. You must remember to FOIL the entire left side and not just square each term.     This question got a little hairy, though. I had to FOIL the left side twice and I ended up with a workable quadratic equation. 1 came out as an answer, but that would make the first radical in the original equation negative.|`|GoEdpprvaa	I believe it's -9. The first step is to square both sides of the equal sign, then combine like-terms, & solve.  Hope I helped =P

HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST 2 CUPS A DAY!|`|OXLJPgUlaa	i LOVE starbucks.  i really like their chais, frappucinos and other hot drinks.  but i never really liked their iced lattes. its either too watery or it overall tastes bad. but i do like their hot lattes. very good.  but i like their marble cakes and pastry and the itunes song giveaway on tuesdays.  its also a cozy and nice place to take my computer up with me daughter and stay.  my daughter likes their hot chocolate.|`|Xnmkdim0aa	LOVE IT|`|AA11955868	Err, I'm an inbetweenie? I used to work at one of the grocery store ones and made me some awesome hot chocolate, and frapps. I don't really care for coffee though so I don't have a real love for it, since that's a pretty big portion of what they sell.     It is pretty expensive, but to know that a good chunk of people are willing to pay that much each day(sometimes twice a day) when there are half a dozen other coffee places that they could go to in the area. Who could blame them?|`|iKcqOdV2aa	eh. dont drink coffee. whats your opinion on it?    and i love hot chocolate, but i get it from the gas station kitty-corner of my house, its much closer|`|ASlr8RKbaa	too much money lol :)|`|1asStWo4aa	In my town, Starbucks is $3.00 for a large, which is actually less expensive than buying coffee at other places around here: Dunken Doughnuts, Daylight Doughnuts, and random coffee houses, etc., etc.,    So I prefer it over most places. Other people I've heard, can't stand the taste though, but I think it's actually really good. Not too sweet but not bitter either. Not to mention that they sell some of the best pasteries, and muffins I've ever eaten.     Actually, I don't get why people hate Starbucks and say it's because they don't like coffee. Sure, its' a coffee house, but there are other things to drink that are pretty cheap. Hot Chocolate, different flavors of tea which are all really good, juices and waters. Not to mention that, if you're an internet junkie like I am, there's free wireless, provided you buy something.     So yeah, I personally LOVE Starbucks, and recommend it to like. . .anyone, if they can afford it where they live. :D|`|9653a537f24f65ac8a46a27607f0d7dcaa	Both love and hate, equally.  I love working there and all the benefits that come with it (free lb of coffee a week, affordable health insurance, mindless job, etc)  but I hate the corporateness of it all.  I mean, if you're going to enforce a strict uniform policy and make us take out piercing and hide tattoos, then don't tell us to express our personalities and be unique.  And by all means, if you are going to try to save cost by cutting labor hours and laying off employees and taking every possible shortcut...then don't buy a 45 million jet with company money and then fly your family to hawaii.  (ahem, howard schultz.)|`|7dGpL4mSaa	I only get their Cappuccinos. I don't like or hate it.|`|xhz1kWroaa	YUCK.  I do not like Starbucks.  I personally think it tastes awful.|`|P2BjtJnUaa	Hate it!  I'm a fan of Dunkin Donuts coffee!|`|agR89OPtaa	Never been there so I couldn't say.  I think they are really proud of their products.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I absolutely LOVE it.      But I can't afford it much these days.  So I do the best I can to make my own concoctions at home.    I also love the atmosphere.  Used to love to go there to just be alone and read a book or something.  Especially at the ones in the Barnes and Nobles    Fave drink:  Mocha Frappuccino with an extra shot of espresso and a shot of Peppermint.  No whip.|`|4aveC2aaaa	HATE it     *never drank coffee before*|`|mggll8dRaa	Never been there...!!|`|07YBD5mJaa	I love it!!  yummy!!!!  i am seriously there for drinks at least twice a week!

I got it started for you!|`|49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	you could talk about the cause behind TOMS shoes.  there's a ton of info out there.  it was started by a guy named blake mycoskie who went to south america and noticed that most of the kids living in poverty didn't own shoes, and it really astounded him.  he started this company so that for every pair of TOMS shoes purchased, another is donated to a child living in poverty.  their motto is "one for one".  they have volunteers participate on "shoe drops" where they literally place these new shoes on these kids' feet.  and it's not just about comfort; in many countries such as ethiopia, podonconiosis can develop from walking in silica-rich soils.  podonconiosis is a disease that causes severe swelling of the legs and feet, but it is 100% preventable by wearing proper footwear.  i think you could talk a lot about this and try to convince your audience to buy a pair of TOMS.    http://www.tomsshoes.com  http://www.tomsshoes.com/ourcause.aspx  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqrFG7xrE...|`|Qp2CzZ4Jaa	Global Warming  Bush/Obama  Isreal/Palestine|`|vD5ysjwraa	Dog tail docking  whether violence in video games encourges it in the real world  schools dont teach enough about life skills  Ageism (however you spell it!)

5QI3I4C8aa	First off, what kind of guitar is it?  Has it got a floyd rose style double locking tremolo or is it a stratocaster style guitar with a stratocaster style trem unit?  If it's the latter you'll not be able to bend the pitch up because the stratocaster tremolo unit isn't designed to be raised as a floating tremolo is.  Aside from that, if you flip your guitar over you'll find a plastic plate on the back. Unscrew it and see how many springs there are in there. If there are 5, or the springs are tightened this will put a LOT of pressure on the tremolo unit and make it harder to use. Try taking a few of the springs out if there seem to be too many, or try loosening the spring claw to get a little more give.|`|pWeSEbhVaa	most whammys you have to push down on, unless its a floyd rose|`|ueAv14FJaa	Well you should return it... i doubt itll work.. and please every1 go to my page and answer my questions about my friend please!!
8b4b7257f99aa7453844e30ba950e978aa	It really depends on the total time that the cap's been left off. A really long time all at once will evaporate it and so will a lot of shorter periods of time... of course, in the end it doesn't really matter because even if you didn't take the cap off at all, ever, it'd still evaporate because the seal around it's not perfect so SOME of it's always evaporating... just not enough to matter.    Good Question. :)

EDIT 2: to Niamh Loves Bows [: -- the two are actually very dissimilar.  if you pay any attention to hanson's recent music, you will see they have almost NOTHING in common with the jonas brothers.  you are definitely entitled to your own opinion, but to say that are similar is just blatantly untrue.  that is what frustrates me... people having no idea what has happened to hanson since mmmbop came out in 1997.|`|XdBlOEJLaa	Jonas Brothers!

So they do ridiculous things with him and so the assassin still thinks he is alive, so he's still trying to kill him and time after time Bernie keeps "coming back to life".

I was born in the early 1960 and the Beatles influenced me a great deal.  The cloths they wore, their long hair, the songs that told how the people in America was starting to feel at that time.  Their music reflected music styles of the 1950 to the 1960's/1970's psychedelic style.|`|HGdpYaZuaa	Yeah, i don't think anyone could be better than the beatles, but the jonas brothers r still good.

The jonas brothers are the opposite.|`|AA11955868	I thank the Jonas Brothers for Truly bring class into a industry that has been really lacking for a long time. Ever since elvis, musicians have become vulgar. Pushing the envelope, coming out with new and insane pieces. The Beatles were even worse in their world wide claim of 'fame'. Just a bunch of perverts with nice hair cuts. That's what really got them in, they looked like such nice boys and BAM. Singing about girls, politics, things that meant something to them. It's ridiculous.     The Jonas Brothers now, they have style. Their work on the baby bottle pop commercial was a well known success and really blew my mind, personally. Now they've been branching out into acting, and everyone knows what a wonderful mix actors and musician's make, (except for will smith, that man is terrible, he should go back to the music) I only see a bright and incredibly long future for the Jonas brothers, I only hope that I will live a long life and see it all.|`|OXLJPgUlaa	The Beatles obviously.

aIdOMU1caa	A strat style guitar is not going to give you the sound of the bands that you mention.  You should look for something with a double humbucker setup and you will also want a distortion pedal.

And here is a super cheap distortion pedal: http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...|`|8JUJJuLmaa	As the other person says, single coil pickups aren't best for that kind of music, but the problem with switching the pickups from single coil to humbucking is that you would have to cut into the guitar to make them fit.  There are humbuckers made in the size of single coils that are around $70 each I think.  Those can be found on websites like musiciansfriend.com and guitarcenter.com.

Action/romance, Action/horror, romance/drama etc    then from there think about your main character, and imagine what you think people would like to read happen to them    after that it should just come into place as you get more and more ideas

We shall just have to wait and see.    Btw i doubt you will get real answers. Everyone will say Heath Ledger is the one and only just because he is dead.|`|xPy6ZePkaa	First of all it has not even been decided who will be the villain in the next Batman movie. Johnny Depp as the Riddler has just been rumored. But I think that he will not do a better job. This was Heaths shinning role and he was the Joker. Depp is the same in most of his roles. Just look at Swenny Todd, Secret Window, The Pirate Movies, he is more of a dark character.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Simply no for me since the joker has always been my fav DC character from the cartoon/comics/movies.But i am a fan of the riddler but depp would have to do some mystical stuff.|`|KLRQqVWfaa	Absolutely not but he will do a good job. He know that if he takes the part that he WILL NOT be as good but people think he is going to try to out act him and he is not gonna be trying to because he has had his moments and he will let people have theirs. He will do a really good job tho. He is actually sharing a part that Heath Ledger was in the process of filming while he died, with another guy to, and they are giving them money to Heath Ledgers daughter for when she gets older.|`|uQNMYkCpaa	No sorry but Heath Ledger was just a classic and he was amazing as the ridler.|`|m4YdxyEuaa	Never. one because hes going to be TRYING to out do ledger. and two because heath ledgers preformance is un-out-do-able.|`|85fJ6U2jaa	i think depp is a better actor, but heath ledger will still have the fact that he died making him seem better. if he didnt die, then johnny depp would be better i think, but the fact that heath ledger died makes him more respected (respected? cant think of the right word, but i think youll get what im saying)|`|AV65vgQFaa	how does someone dying make them more respectable?  that's dumb as hell.    i think if there wasn't so much hype about heath's performance, hell yeah he could.  johnny depp is epic.|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	Heath Ledger played the Joker not the riddler. I think Jonny Depp might playe the role of the Riddler very well.|`|40uBQQfIaa	well i am a huge huge depp fan, and i think every single thing he does is gold, but heath did a fantastic job. I think Johnny has the potential to, but heath has the fact that he past away. With the pitty factor involved i dont think so. atleast not to the majority of the public. To me, Johnny will own even if he did the crappiest job ever.

I will paste the links for you to see them. I think the Steeler's will win. Don't ask me how the Cardinals will made it. They were REALLY bad at the begging and then they just were good near the end.

Check Old Navy again as they may have reatocked the racks of coats(especially on a Saturday). Ask the store clerk if they have your size in the back(in stock) or will they get more in (your size),  Have a nice day!

[[it's a bosnian song, so no use in mentioning it]]  but when it comes up on my ipod i freeze and get the chills    it's insane, because it's such a party song adn all my friends love it, i can't listen to it, it brings back so many memories that are really amazing, but gone.     music is AMAZING but it can cause hell at times.

I tell them how I see it whether they like it or not. Folks sometimes don't appreciate it.     I do what I think is right. Even if it means ruffling folks feathers. I keep my word for example and sometimes this creates conflicts of interest. Hate it when it does but I don't lie to anybody who isn't in authority. I keep my word if at all possible as long as it's not about remembering to do stuff.     I am focused on what I'm doing so much that I sometimes forget there are people around me much less pay the requisite levels of attention they expect. If I hang around them or let them hang around me I honestly like them. If I didn't my honesty part would run them off LOL. I just get focused on stuff and driven to accomplish the goal and folks feel like I'm looking right through them or not paying attention to them. They get ticked when I don't come hang out with them. Me I'm not into hanging out, I'm into doing stuff so hanging out with somebody is doing something with them. I'm very task oriented and rarely am content at social gatherings where I'm not running the show. I just don't dig sitting around talking that much. If I'm at break at work I'll do it since what else are ya going to do in 10 mins? It's not that I hate talking to people, people are interesting and everybody has something to teach you if your willing to listen. I just hate sitting still that long. I'm out getting a smoke or if I'm talking I'm learning or preparing to do something not just shooting the breeze. To intentionally go spend hours shooting the breeze is torture to me. Folks just don't understand why I don't like doing it. I can play chess for hours on end. I can spend entire days with a guitar in my hand. Don't even have to say a word or I can enjoy the convo as it's going. Long as I'm DOING something at the same time. Gotta be doing something. Friends often feel slighted by my anti-social behavior. Nothing against them. They are interesting people who I like being around. However if we are not doing something there is nobody I aint bonking that I just want to sit around and talk with. Talk is what you do WHILE your doing something not a goal in itself for me.|`|D0cz3oJWaa	By having more than one view of things|`|dYyiG90caa	I don't.

x6XOcWHGaa	Superior... I don't think of things in those terms, we all have ego but the ego doesn't necessarily need to consider itself superior to be satisfied. I was born into a situation that has afforded me the opportunity to develop my mind and think things through which makes me appear to be what would be called "intelligent". But intelligence isn't quantifiable, and I don't feel superior for being this way. I chalk it all up to my luck, not my superiority. People tell me I'm good looking, intelligent, talented etc... but I just think to myself that I'm a lucky son of a *****.    I suppose it's that I see the entire situation as a game of chance... so there's no superiority in my eyes. I could have been a child born in Africa doomed to die of AIDS at the age of 5... but I wasn't, I was instead born in Laguna Beach, California with a relatively wealthy family. I am lucky, not superior.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	I don't indulge in feelings of superiority. However I do know more about English literature, grammar and composition than most people I know, even the native-English-speakers.    Perhaps my knowledge of cinema is greater than most. However where I live, that isn't hard.  So I have nothing to feel "superior" about, considering I'm a dead loss with figures and red tape.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	In equality...|`|dYyiG90caa	I hate Conceit -- but, subconsciously -- I probably DO feel superior to Others lol :))    I guess in having a Freaking Open Mind -- So many people are stuck "in the box" about the way they see the World.    ...and they're Belief Systems, whether Religious, Scientific, or Environmentally Acquired -- TRAP THEM !! imo.    I admit I have "knee-jerk" reactions to "automatically" believing something that appears obvious.    Then I have to Slap Myself and Remind ME that I am being a Sloppy   Scientist.    Unless I am about to be Killed -- There is NO DANGER in Having an Open-Mind and Challenging the "Status Quo" thinking.    So many have their Minds "made up" on a particular Subject -- and They are STUBBORN IDIOTS. imo.    So -- If I think I am better than people -- It is in being Open-Minded to ANY POSSIBILITY -- Whether it "passes the Status Quo Belief Systems" of Our Society -- OR -- Not.    Read -- 1984 -- The Truth is What you are Taught and 2+2 = 5    When you allow yourself to be BrainWashed by the Current & Popular Social Thinking --    Keep Your Mind Open -- That the MAJORITY Just Might Be Wrong.    At one time -- The Majority Believed that SLAVERY was "Okay."    I'm done.    P.S. -- "STATUS QUO" is an AWESOME BAND !! ;)  .|`|JOPqyZYGaa	i am a redhead. not so many people are redheads. and i am very pretty too. i'm so proud of me :)|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Age and experience..

TwrGic9Uaa	No Way.  Its too dangerous.  There are safer ways and places to meet someone.  Don't go there. Seriously, there are alot of very strange people out there who use the internet as a tool.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	NO WAY...  Seems creepy|`|L1DUcTtSaa	NO WAY!  You don't know who they are they proberably lye about who they are, they could be dangerous, meet through friends or a family member or something, online dating is crap.|`|AA11504809	I wouldn't, no way, people only tell you the information about themselves that they want you to know. they could say anything. on the other hand my cousin is engaged to a guy she met online, but she met him through a proper dating website. it'd be harder to lie on those sites you need a credit card to sign up and the name on the card is used on the profile.|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	No way.... I'm married.|`|XMTG2XlXaa	No way.|`|hH6LTbEtaa	NO WAY  You dont know who you are talking to they could be a rapist for all you know dont do it i tells ya !!|`|66686d7c67e93a65d4cebd2bd2c9baf8aa	no, you cant trust that person. what if you two met and he's not what you thought he was? dont go for it, it's best for U|`|4wHjtkJXaa	NO WAY HO - ZAY    could be anyone.|`|PhiFWmLlaa	ok -but harder to tell about the person ahead of time, so just talk to them more, lots, before meeting.|`|JOAPnhOgaa	sure why not  made many friends this way  some also turned into something more :)))|`|uIIvMi68aa	no way.but i do like having random friends to talk to|`|3PfkXTouaa	its ok.

You can find your match, but you'd have to go through a LOT of weird and bad fish out in the sea =(.      However, it's a good dating experience dependin on the person.  But fo rme personally, no way.  I'd like to find my 'one' by fate.|`|tqBy3vXvaa	NO WAY! This particular person you may be dating might be posing as let's say a 15 yr old but they're actually like 40. They could hack your computer and find out your adress. This person may not be who he/she says they are.|`|d7700e32c034b0231bc54ef45dd9e791aa	No Way!  I got a friend who went through eharmony and even with the all the checking they do it has been scary for her.  She has a stalker now.|`|r6oi1HyZaa	it depends... you have to have the utmost trust in the other person.  Both parties have to be willing to partake in dating too.  I've tried it a couple of times and it hasn't worked out very well; hopefully you have better luck than lord does.|`|G1lSbvAQaa	Okay, if you see their pics and know it's them.  Like adding peopleo on facebook and stuff yes. Seeing videos of actually them so you know who you're talking to, that kind of thing.  They can hold up a paper with their name and take a picture too, duh.|`|50UbJp14aa	no way, i dont have anything to say, my mind is blank. i cannot think of what to say st8 away|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	No way it causes nothing but hurt in the end reality takes over and frustration wins out....|`|a4fddaf6a1e7cc689b0611f98a1c96acaa	OK gets my Vote.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	NO WAY|`|lIQhB56Oaa	no waaaaay!!!!!!!|`|qVhqc019aa	No, cos you dont what - or who - you are dating!    ?

We will ask no page in sto-ry,   Proud-er than the spot-less glo-ry,   Of a land that gives her might   To the bat-tle of the right.

ij9N9r5waa	Why should we, what would we use in it's place.  grudgingly mean about spending,  Too many words  PC is one thing, but getting offended by a legitimate word that has nothing to do with race is just stupid.

It's a word, and anyone who is saying that it's a racist word is someone who should for once in their life use a dictionary and look it up! The word says nothing about black people, therefore is NOT a racist word! The word can be applied to anyone who is a moron! Obama is more of a racist word than the aforementioned word.  I'd never use it, because it sounds redneck and low class, but geesh, why not eliminate most of the english language because it's offensive to people.

5kcO165naa	Stephen Colbert, because bears ARE godless killing machines.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	Jon Stewart, but I love Stephen too.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	I can't choose.  I'm glad they are two different shows, but on in the same hour.|`|IDcIww7Baa	Jon Stewart|`|AA11658197	jon|`|J1XwqvLGaa	They're both hot :)|`|R4EYPeLGaa	Jon Stewart all the way baby.    ok|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Oh. Both of them are amazing. I just can't choose.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	Tough call, both are funny, but I'll have to go with Colbert|`|B5YsTF4iaa	Jon Stewart anyday. I've watched both for a long time, and Colbert seems to appeal to the teens and young adults, while Stewart is more businesslike, thats the only word that comes to mind. They are both silly and erratic, but Colbert seems cheap and novel. He seems to be faking it, while Stewart seems naturally funny. Like the difference between Jim Carrey (over-actor) and Robin Williams. Carrey gets laughs like Colbert, by silliness, and childish humor, while you need to be atleast 23 to really understand a lot of Williams jokes. This is merely my opinion. I understand WHY most prefer Colbert, because he appeals to the "idiots" and rednecks, and people who really don't want to think. Stewart actually engages your mind with his intuition and inference. While Colbert engages the little boy in all of us. I actually use to prefer/watch Colbert instead of Stewart, but one day I just got annoyed at his yelling, antics and the worst part the ANNOYS me for some reason. Like, actually makes me upset, is how he interupts his guests. I would NEVER go on Colberts show. Next time watch Stewart and Colbert back to back, and you'll notice that Stewart actually engages in philosophical, theoritical and deep conversations with his guests. Colbert will interupt with something stupid to make people laugh. I've notice a lot of guests actually fake laughing because they need the advertising/spot. Remember, Stewart made Colbert who is today. Stewart came first, and ironically, is always first in line in programming on cable.|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	Stephen Colbert    He makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.|`|aDG8EteIaa	Colbert ^_^|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Colbert is way funnier, and very quick witted.|`|8c024fd033abbec1adae82e0df74a4acaa	Stewart is awesome and everything  but Colbert is more of a badass, and isnt afraid to insult people.   I'd have to go with Colbert.|`|BU8GnAw0aa	I like them both equally for different reasons.

vj2pOgT7aa	It is BOTH.    There is a real fish taco on the menu at one of the local chain tex mex places.  It's quite tasty.    It is also a euphemism for the female reproductive organs. Referencing the outer labia which sometimes appear to be taco shaped, as well as a crude allusion to the tuna-like odor that the the genital area can sometimes have.     =0)|`|AA11658197	it can be euphamism for a lady part in the hip area or it can be an actual food item|`|dDDAbqqhaa	you've spent way too long on this q|`|blhIjLr8aa	2 points, yes!|`|9acXPi8gaa	It's just an entree... fish+taco= fish taco.|`|frwlypDWaa	It actually is an entree at some restaurants. It's also used in a disparaging way to refer to a woman's vagina.     Something tells me you know what "disparaging" means...|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	just like pink tacos I imagine|`|4x5ajsUpaa	What?|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Its a vagina...a smelly one in particular|`|TcuRYwiwaa	LMAO!    Vagina.|`|PA0gmwd5aa	?|`|zzivfC0qaa	Fish tacos...ever heard of pink tacos. Fish smell, taco is in the shape of a: starts with a V and ends in A its not Vendetta|`|YhjTbSmDaa	I dont think "fish taco" has a euphemism...    A fish taco is basically a fish taco...or at least to my knowledge.|`|EOTH56DWaa	It's the place you keep your tampons 5 days per month.|`|HnTpvVEEaa	why do u care?|`|rnQjDbAdaa	I would take a guess and say Vagina.|`|0LBNKveLaa	Vagina|`|Xnmkdim0aa	what did you say.|`|v0kb4hgBaa	HAHA ok so a euphemism is trying to say something in a nicer way. So instead of saying " He is dead" you say "He has passed on"  A fish taco is a girls genital area.  Sorry but yeah thats what it means =)|`|eQPy6KP2aa	It's an entree and a euphemism for female private parts.
Rmy8bWnsaa	I saw the movie again a few days ago actually, and yeah she says "not everybody gets corrupted". Although, it is hard to hear the 'not'. Great movie though. I've been watching all my Woody Allen DVD's again recently, just watched Sleeper and Deconstructing Harry last night.    edit: Ok I watched that part with subtitles just to be sure, and yeah there's a 'not' lol.
440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	I hate people like that. There are already so many children in the world that need to be adopted and obviously, you're body is telling you you can't have kids but screw that! Science can fix it!!    I think anyone that does in vitro fertilization needs help. Obviously, you're body can't handle having kids and you just aren't meant to physically give birth to them but that doesn't mean you can't be a parent. There are millions of kids that need to be adopted. Adopt a kid or become a foster parent!      EDIT: To the people who are saying it's not her fault: it is. She could have selectively reduced the number of embryos or she could have not had so many embryos implanted in the first place. She already had six kids, more than enough for most people, yet she's obviously not completely stable and thought it would be a dandy idea to have more!|`|SPvkz1kQaa	Yeah I have heard about it! There're trying to find out how she managed to get more fertility treatment if she already had six children. And they think she knew she was going to have eight more children!|`|DN9RZHi3aa	she loves kids  leave her alone  its not a sin  GOD!|`|TTpMYhrUaa	yeah..selfish *****.|`|oA8wHSwOaa	i think thats SO irrisponsible. what the heck is her problem?!|`|6OplSEQkaa	okay, that is a little crazy. but still, it's NOT HER FAULT that she had 14... She didn't want octuplets, did she? You guys are being stupid, read the article, she had OCTUPETS!!! THAT'S NOT A DECISION SHE CAN MAKE!|`|lAYUkCivaa	WOW!|`|cu4AjE4Oaa	at least the other family that is on tv that had all those kids have both parents..............|`|AA11658197	add to that she still lives with her parents|`|AA10640608	I agree with you. Her mother even thinks she is nuts. Poor kids!|`|9kLiiDzVaa	that is crazy|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Ya....shes an idiot|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Poor woman. She's crazy.|`|33ppbrMJaa	This isn't the joyous birth of a baby. This is a litter of children who will have no idea of their parentage on their father's side.  This woman isn't married, so she may live her life on the public dole. Society is caught in a quandary, because you can't ignore the needs of the children, and one wonders if that wasn't her reason for getting pregnant again.  She is said to have wanted one more baby, but she got eight.    On the distaff side, Republicans have encouraged the births of children, and approve banning the use of contraceptives. So, a baby here, eight babies there, a few more over here....and the Republicans are happy, except when it comes time to feed and clothe and put out the money these children will need.    The only hope is that some magazine will pay millions to get the first pictures and this source of revenue may continue as the babies grow up..  .    This gal's obsession with children may fade as she tries to care for 14 kids, with the future health problems these babies may have.|`|AKVQNGcOaa	I think she needs serious help!|`|NPwOxS3eaa	It's not like she knew she was going to have octuplets. I mean she cant exactly wake up and say "Hey im going to give birth to 8 twins"    I just hope she will be able to handle it all. :[|`|dC6DX99gaa	i kno i heard!! but u kno i saw on tv about this couple who had *16* kids!!!! can u believe it!?!?!? how can they possibly pay and care for all those children!!! like that movie cheaper by the dozen.boy was it crazy.shes not really crazy.but it does sound a little crazy to wanting to have 16 children.u would need a hotel to have room for those kids!!! how would they sleep and go to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i guess it is crazy.|`|k4Gt0QAxaa	whys that such a bad thing?she loves kids???  just hope she'll be ale to take care of them all|`|sqPoFZ00aa	I heard about that lady on Fox News this morning. I think she needs help too. I don't think it's normal to be as obsessed with children as she is.|`|XdBlOEJLaa	I think she's crazy

ZsKrYCYCaa	according to the couples that I've seen marrying lately, I'd say its option 3. they don't have any choice...if they don't marry, the most action they'll get in bed is making it and fluffing the pillows.|`|p55JnISnaa	idk, maybe you should ask them yourself.|`|tcITvTF9aa	love babby girl...|`|aMpMFLo3aa	lol   thats funny I only got married to my hubby because I was in love and in love with him  thats a must!!! not because he was good in bed, :).....|`|KQJPWWjeaa	love|`|qrGzsQWzaa	I would prefer to marry for love with the good in bed being a big plus.|`|fgPEOWuxaa	the second option. but its a combination of both

YhjTbSmDaa	People always say you get what you pay for, but generic brands are usually just as good as store brands.|`|9D3i9s5eaa	name brands|`|H1YaVLqwaa	Just depends. i will try the store   brand ; &+ then if it is nasty i choose  the name brand items . (:|`|paRqMN9xaa	Brand name items.|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	I usually get a bit of both.  There are some things I won't compromise on so will buy the name brand items but I do buy store brand items too :-)|`|dC6DX99gaa	a little of both.my dad(im 11 i with my parents) buys Jewel peanut butter but he gets Downy laundry detergent.|`|RTydE7Kkaa	Depends whats better.|`|og9xLQ6Xaa	Brand Name, store brand stuff is nasty.  x|`|qz2rQhC0aa	anything|`|Mx33cku8aa	depends on if there is a store brand available. many items that i purchase don't usually have a store brand equal.|`|hlGXhHg3aa	Its become a nice mix of both these days, sometimes it makes absolutely no difference.|`|LyauFqaaaa	mayo and parm chees is name brand. sometimes i do go for the generic. you would be suprised that some of the name brand stuff comes from same place as generic labels. for example domino sugar is made at the same place the cheap sugar is made from it's all about labels.|`|nNTrEEKXaa	I am a fan of store brands. But, on some things you shouldn't compromise. Like oatmeal. Store brand oatmeal tastes and looks remarkably like rubber.|`|3e35f384e6ba91685b275ec068631f7daa	brand names|`|VgRy6jxuaa	Both. It depends on the product. Macaroni & Cheese, definitely Kraft. Dish detergent, always Cascade. But, most things I buy are generic brand.|`|l6dOPCWoaa	it depends on the  item  i buy both  brands store and   brands name|`|N9VN9bwfaa	It depends on the item.  I buy store brand bread because I think it's pretty good and I'll use it within the week.  But I've bought store brand canned goods and found a lot of woody stems and inedible bits.  So I don't buy those anymore.  Similarly, I no longer buy store brand paper goods because they are poor quality.  But I don't often buy the brands that are advertised on TV either because those are too expensive.  I try to go for relatively inexpensive items but I do want a certain quality, and I'm looking for healthy foods, so sometimes that means things will actually be more expensive -- less salt always is higher priced for example and usually means it has to be a famous brand as the store doesn't make that.  Same way for less sugar or no sugar.  But that's important to me.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Store brand is usually cheaper, and I'm a college student, soo, yeah...|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Depends if I've ever tasted the store brand.  Normally, the name brand.  You get what you pay for.|`|i171LlfTaa	Brand Name items.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	store brands, I'm cheap|`|NREqhragaa	brand names.  idk wut them crazy store people put in them..|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	It depends on what I'm buying but often times I buy the store brand food. It usually tastes exactly the same but is so much cheaper. And, like someone already said, I'm a college student so I get the cheaper stuff.     I don't "settle" for the store brand stuff though, I like the store brand stuff I get. I do get certain name brand things though.|`|9dAcLvijaa	i dont care|`|HWkXDSqkaa	I find that usually store brand taste better.  :]

uiKAI8bWaa	OK I just commented on this, it is insulting to those who answer if the question goes to vote.  If you cant make it to a computer I can understand, it happens to us all.  When I answer I am answering the questioner not someone flicking through voting.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	bugs bunny rules    voting your answer as best|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Select my own.

I want to choose my BA!|`|nErAWfHxaa	I like to choose my own best answers because there are lots of people here who win "best answer" simply because they get all their friends to vote for their answer even if it's mediocre. Plus a few people have multiple accounts and do that.     I "paid" 5 points to ask the question and get 3 back for choosing best answer so why forfeit the points and let cheaters have an advantage?|`|YvOm6u65aa	I prefer choosing my own best answer.|`|T0fwqL2baa	I second Regwah|`|iQOqj2KVaa	I love to pick BA myself. Had a few slip into vote from me being busy, but I prefer to pick.   Nice to see you I missed ya. = ) xx Sugar bug|`|WbRuTjmFaa	Some voters just vote randomly to get the 1 point it seems as the best answer does not always go to the most suited to receive it.   I get hightly upset when my question goes to vote as I was not notified properly beforehand and was not aware that it was being voted on until it was to late to vote on it myself.  so now I try to watch closer and make sure I give out my own.  I think it is more personal then and means something.

I'm at that point in my life (and in a Maine winter) when one day is much like another.

2Sf8zSdlaa	rofl. you've done it again! thanks for brightening up an otherwise boring day.     Ok.. ahem..(serious now)... if you don't succeed, maybe the punishment is they'll make you live FOREVER!    If you succeed... they'll put your corpse in prison and sentence you eternal damnation!    Rofl (sorry... can't help it)|`|6OplSEQkaa	It is, and how can they punish you if you're already dead? They can't kill you.  If you attempt suicide and fail, then they put you in the loony bin.|`|nBHGzFfBaa	It's a way for someone who wanna go in hell...|`|AKVQNGcOaa	It wouldn't really matter if you were dead would it?|`|EVYSvkIraa	no its not illegal unless its in public.   jumping off a bridge is considered illegal cause you block traffic usually and its a public disturbance basically. and committing it would mean you actually killed yourself so there is no way to punish you.. attempted suicide is what you can have a punishment to. even thought it would most likely just be a fine and admittance to a psychiatric hospital.|`|RbWmygLTaa	Yes it is illegal and they make you vote  the democratic party line|`|EFgKYxPfaa	I always wonder about that. If it is illegal and  you succeeded in committing suicide, what are they going to do to you?

jCVDpseqaa	Stop reading manga.    If I were you I'd try looking into the reasons WHY it's made you depressed, and take it from there.    Maybe there's types of manga that you can both enjoy, and enhance your relationship. Perhaps you could ask your girlfriend what it is about manga that she likes so much.    I would take this as an opportunity to become closer, rather than using it as a reason to be down.    Don't worry about it - it's REALLY not worth it, you've already used up too much energy on it, but then I'm not an expert.    Good luck with this.|`|lbB4lq6Daa	im hiding in your toaster|`|8PhOCtcZaa	Not everyone can make out with someone they barely know..... ur gf probably only likes it because it's a good story, don't think that she's gonna do that|`|qyYYrIdmaa	I throw oranges at the postman.

I think this is a sign of a deeper problem, you should talk to someone about this.|`|QsLyrYQEaa	Explain why you're depressed?  Is it because you don't think you'll ever find yourself in a position to make out with a stranger in the elevator?  If so then at least be glad you have a girlfriend.      If it's because you're saddened by the cheapening of love in today's society to the point that even strangers can exchange physical pleasantries without really knowing one another...  Then get off your high horse.

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

I am trying to feel some form of normal or feel anything for that matter.  Over a year and a half ago my Mom passed away and I have not been right sense. That simple.  Nothing really is a problem anymore because I can not care much for anything.  The thing I fear the most is not being the next person to die in my family.  It scares me so much to have to go threw all the pain and hurt of the lost of a close loved one.  My 91 year old grandmother is my best friend and I am not built to take another lose and her being 91 makes me think a lot.    I know how you feel some what about your situation.  Ten years ago I had one of my best friends kill himself and that was life changing.  As it sounds it has been for you?  Drifting apart is normal to some point.  If you build a distance between you and friends it lessens it a friend leaves your life for what ever reason.  Also, part of the depression is self isolation.  I did it and do it.  I became a very reclusive person and it is what is best for me.  Good luck.  Give it time and them more time.  Your life has changed and that is normal for what you went through.

Full screen is fine if you are not an aficionado of cinema technology, but you miss as much as 20% if the total picture is not seen in its cinema format (Wide screen). Let me illustrate...  Full screen    (viewable picture)  the   sign is other things not seen in it's full screen format such as scenery, other people, the set, animals, someone lurking just off screen waiting to kill our hero.    Wide screen (total picture) You don't miss thing and it's in correct proportion. No long faces.     Sometimes if you really appreciate the set and/or scenery Wide screen is a necessary evil. Dval|`|Dn8Rc9gfaa	wide.|`|mrB9ED3Caa	full screen|`|XAT5ZkNmaa	wide screen becaus full screen cut of the edges. so with wide screen you get the full picture|`|Omu7AbmQaa	I used to HATE widescreen, those bars bug the crap out of me.

It was all a rotten carve-up 'cos I wasn't American and I'm black.  They said I failed the screen test because of my stutter but I think it was really because I was 5'2" and weighed 9 stone. They took no regard of my faster flying speed and it was a clear case of discrimination.  I became an Insurance salesman but it wasn't half as good and now I'm 65 and weigh 15 stone I don't think I'll get another chance.       (Sorry you didn't make it as a sparrow.

xdrzKo2paa	presenting my senior thesis without a doubt was the most embarrassing moment to date.   If your not aware of what the undergraduate senior thesis is, please allow me to clarify: its a private project of interest pertaining to the major your at college for. It was described to me from my adviser as "the most important presentation and documents of your academic career"..Yikes!. Of course i was nervous but i was prepared (or so i thought) I worked diligently on trying to think of every question anyone in the audience could ask varying from the ridiculous to the insanely complex and difficult.   when the Q&A part of my presentation came the head of the philosophy department asked me a question i could not answer. Immediately i turned red in the face and apparently (according to a former professor of mine in the audience) said " well, I trust the next present or can tackle that question!.." i recall hearing many snickering and giggling from others... the kind that secretly mean "sucks to be you!" I persisted to not-so-smoothly 'move on' to attempt to answer the other gregarious flock of raised hands in the audience of about 50-60 people,   what a train wreck.|`|883c4qObaa	accident in front my house..i ride my motorbike and got and accident infront my house|`|F48TTWQ3aa	when I said Bubby

mv8kcUUMaa	The first two stanzas are biblical references, but largely the song is a disillusioned point of view about love. "Love is not a victory march/ its a cold and it's a broken hallelujah" really shows that the clearest. Basically it is the opinion that love causes pain. He references his own relationship and a sexual encounter in the fourth stanza, and ends with a melancholy and haunting conclusion: that the truth about love is not the 'cry' of an enlightened person, it is a bitter realization that can only break you forever.|`|K36jovxfaa	sounds great|`|S253XERKaa	will i don't know what this song is about but what HALLELUJAH  is a hebrew word used in the bible in Psalms requesting a congregation to join in praise and in english version it means praise the lord|`|And9dyrwaa	It means praise the god and we are tellin these in order to happen the own wish of each individuals..

There is always the chance of getting pregnant and who's to say the relationship is even going to work? Plus, there are sexually transmitted diseases to worry about. If you find out after you're married that they aren't good in bed, it should matter. If you love someone, you take them as they are. Sex isn't the most important thing in a relationship.|`|lIQhB56Oaa	Before because I don't want to get married.|`|f634e4db5029a87b6d4fc2ef877c91e1aa	I would choose sex after marriage because, it's a sin to not wait to have sex until marriage and you won't actually no what love is until you've vowed that you'd be with that person forever.

edde127b1150f72ea601ce2bc4a9a90baa	Why not?  When we are children, we try to excel in school so that we can get a "gold star" and rush home to show Mom and Dad so that they can tell us how smart we are. As children, we all look for the payoff; be it praise, a trip to the Movie, a pat on the head etc. As adults, we should face a challenge to boost our confidence and self-esteem. What better way to do this then to compete for the "hell of it" when  there is no pay off except personal satisfaction.|`|HoYvAueuaa	I may at times fall, but I never stop getting back up again. I won't ever lose my will to try. What kind of life could you live being a quitter. I compete for pride.|`|QEqGukjZaa	yeah sure..still fun to compete|`|y5FfKGAsaa	depends what the competition is about, but sure! :)|`|eAhkr1ruaa	Depends on what it was for.  But I suppose I would, just to feel the natural high you get from winning.  ?.blondy|`|mUMMLjDdaa	sure i would.|`|UjUbCll8aa	Well, there has to be some sort of reward...or else there would be no point.|`|kFI6JAHSaa	No....when it comes to competitions, there always has to be an end prize..  I am an extremely competitive person, like you have no idea. I know *know* its a terrible thing. But I can't help it.|`|Ihyv0ZdXaa	no i woudlnt|`|C8dNhpoKaa	Yeah, it would be fun to win. = ]
HoYvAueuaa	I don't really find that amusing... Peer pressure can be hard to resist. As much as people say their decisions are there own, there is always some degree of outside influence. The good side to this is that a good friendship or relationship can bring out the absolute best in people. Everyone responds in some way or another to the suggestions of others. It's just human nature.|`|WbRuTjmFaa	If you dont want to hang upside down with JC I do.. I love hanging upside down.. cool!    I am easily amused and love to watch human behaviour. It is a wonderful hobby.|`|ucswpeSKaa	yea and its annoying..|`|G4qG1Zakaa	No because I have no friends.|`|KQJPWWjeaa	not amused so much, but it's interesting|`|f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	Absolutely and I love it.  I'm actually happy to see different facets of peoples personalities.  The world is alive with color. So are we.  When was the last time you hung upside down from a tree hun?  Care to join me?  We'll just wave at everyone that walks by.|`|QEqGukjZaa	lol..yeah that happens alot on yahoo..and real life..    ppl are what you call Two Face here..    but yeah...thats life..lol|`|AA10227117	OMG YEES!  lol|`|eAhkr1ruaa	Yes, most of the time people are like that.  Especially the "popular" kids that I'm friends with. When they're with their friends they aren't the nicest people. But every single one of them, when I'm alone with them, they're VERY nice, fun loving people.  ?.blondy|`|edde127b1150f72ea601ce2bc4a9a90baa	It is a sad state of affairs to have to dictate or make decisions for ones friends. It has not happened to me, because I do not make decisions for anyone except myself. I was taught as a child that I would have to make decisions for myself and then to accept the responsibility for my decisions. If I made the right decision, good for me, if I made a wrong decision, I had to live with that decision. That has worked for me all my life and I have made more good decisions then bad ones. I would not presume to make a decision for anyone else.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	yes, very much so.  people in general are so different one-on-one than together with a group.  :0|`|ahXIBlstaa	yes! especially in high school...|`|eb320c61f8255212bc30d67d90831580aa	yeah sometimes they are more annoyier than before haha lol|`|mUMMLjDdaa	yes i am.|`|kFI6JAHSaa	Yes...its amazing how completely different people can be when they aren't with their friends.   They're more real. More...open. I guess because they do not have this...well I wouldn't say protection, because its more of a commanding power. Like they are exposed and vulnerable....  This is why I like being with people when we are by ourselves, and they don't have their crowd to change....    I don't know if I am amused...well...yeah, amused, but I mostly pity them...|`|U9HdoeWVaa	my mom tries to tell me i act different when people come over  i be like no i didnt wanna funk wit yall then  and i dont wanna funk wit yall now  simple az dat|`|AA11120560	Yes I am very amused by how they act when their friends are not around
fKvLGQfwaa	Only if you want to experiment. You'll never know if you don't try. And hair is forgiving. If you don't like what you've done, just wear your bangs back on your head until they grow out again. It can be fun to try different styles. Have fun.    Cheers|`|RFK9sG6zaa	Wait until someone can help you.|`|PTnjk6pqaa	Weird.  I'm worrying about getting my hair cut. I'm going to get sweeping bangs! I'm very nervous.    But I would NEVER cut my own hair. I don't even trust the people at Great Clips or Fantastic Sams.. I go to the more professional people.    My advice- go to a more professional place, but don't cut your own hair!  It might turn out bad..|`|BqKdCjOIaa	don't do it  why can't you just go to a barber shop?|`|qd3sumW3aa	honestly, cutting your bangs isnt that much of a 'risk'  just try to cut it the way you want to (if its sideswept, cut diagonally etc etc)  i've been cutting my own bangs for like.. 3 years now and my friends always tell me my bangs look great.  just take it slowly, cut a little bit at a time cause if you chop of a lot at once and its too short, thats problematic.|`|Rmtfm7qnaa	NO!!! I've done it and it looked HORRIBLE!  The only reason you should even think about it is if you've got a really steady hand, a good straight mirror, and something to make sure you're cutting straight across and not at an angle|`|AA10724468	You may wanna watch a quick tutorial on youtube or something first.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	NO! don't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|bYo5UTa9aa	no. just go to a hairstylist if you really want it done. what is the big rush?|`|oQrtjivsaa	unless you have good cutting scissors, i don't think you should|`|su37vnIXaa	theres enough ugly people in the world|`|DPmU5gB6aa	PLEASE DON'T!! I tried it once and it was a complete disaster!|`|JNcbYYoraa	No, it's a bad idea. It's fine to ask a friend to do it, but to do it yourself is really awkward and difficult.|`|0L0llku8aa	I don't think you should risk that.|`|uaq8OSUjaa	Go to a professional|`|HHOfEmZDaa	no dont. the last time i did, my hairdresser yelled at me for doing it haha.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	sure go ahead and do it. we don't have to look at you.|`|L6c4wPPGaa	Cut yourself at the risk of messing up?  Or getting a good hairstyle for a few bucks?|`|gZMNQF4oaa	go for it.  its just hair.  it will grow back.|`|RfPDOPEwaa	i do it all the time  just start it by cutting it long like by the bottom of your nose and then if you think your doing it right, cut it as much as you want.  good luck lol|`|speJXeIhaa	Yup do it, i do mine,never  messed up yet..|`|oRAWPrRJaa	i dont think soo.. you might mess up lol.|`|miJ7Xbyvaa	I wouldn't|`|YhjTbSmDaa	NO.|`|bWNyWXrSaa	It's your hair.  Do what you want.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	No.  It doesn't cost much to have someone in a salon do it.  Why risk it to save a few bucks?|`|MdXwD2JSaa	Meh, I wouldn't.  Just wait till your next hair cut.|`|aPaPlEiCaa	i wouldn't|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Ugh, last time I tried to do that, I messed up really bad|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	Why the hell not? Hair grows.    I gave myself atrocious layers over the summer and I was fine with it since whenever I do anything to my hair, I always tell myself "It will grow out."    Worse comes to worse, you just go to a salon and have them fix it. But like I always say, you should everything at least once. So go for it.|`|ed98cf0ff3753b1358a5edf38dc953b1aa	no!! it will look bad since you've never tried. why not just go to a salon|`|vikWyz0Aaa	I tried to cut my hair myself and ended up having to mend my mistake by buzzing my head. However, I liked my buzzed head and still have it to this day. Try it, and you may really like it.|`|76AMUhZnaa	i would go somewhere to get them done. it wouldn't really be a waste of money or time because they wont mess up. chances are that you will mess up and do you honestly want that???    i would go and get bangs at a professional place that way IF they mess up you can try to get your money back. lol|`|ij9N9r5waa	Noooooooooo, Might as well let the boy next door do it. same skill level.|`|a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	My sister cuts her own hair and she's not professional at all, but it always turns out nice and natural-ooking because it's not completely stright, kinda zigzag... not the best way to describe it, but yea, it looks good... :) Go for it!|`|K2QwEM4raa	Sure they will grow back.  But I would cut them at the bridge of the nose.  That way when the bangs are dry they want be to short.  If you want real long bangs go lower on your nose.  Start out by not going to far back on your head, you can always ad more hair if you like it.  You can always go shorter if you want to. I have done it a million times.|`|Lvmpn4EPaa	no you shouldnt|`|HFEotT1Qaa	If I cared I'd say no, but since I don't...*Passes scissors*    If it doesn't work you can always shave it, worked for Brittney Spears.|`|hxNBgXXaaa	if you've never done it before, i don't think you should  x|`|ZvffYVuSaa	my mate (girl) shaved the side of her head off by herself, and it looks really good.    Go for it.|`|x1qKlJZQaa	Do it! As long as your really careful! Good Luck i'm sure it will turn out Great! :-)|`|XDr0aQWSaa	Go to a hair stylist! Never do it yourself!|`|kAsfXZzVaa	i wouldent just go get ur hair cut
lLB5nN3paa	I love these types of questions.  They are always amusing.  I would definately have to go with option D.  Option C sounds really appealing but I like to dish out my version of pain which would be multiplied by a 100 times more than the one she has given me.  I would gag the old b*tch and drag her wrinkley carcus to an abandoned wherehouse.  I would slowly skin her so the pain would make her wish that she would have died of old age.  Then, I would start taking off her toes and fingers.  I will allow her to bleed to death at that point because it will take some time for her to actually die.  While waiting for her demise, she will feel the effects of what I've done to her.  Stupid old hag had it coming.    One of these days you should put yourself in these questions rather than an old woman.  You would love my response more if you did ;)|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I would get the hell away from her and only use violence as a last resort. D.|`|ijpU8jSCaa	kickk her in the shines and walk away calmly .|`|YTLePvkVaa	I would turkey slap the old hag.|`|KojH3RiUaa	I'd take her dentures and threaten to stomp them if she didn't stop.    :)|`|qIEHRHGaaa	i would be like "wtf" maybe slap her once, and run away|`|blbd7e1Qaa	Well, probably the granny is high with PCP (Angeldust)  and forgot her Uzi in the retirement home, and "totally p*ssed and invinciple...".    So, I would go for alternate alternative...    D)  Using (without any hesitation) a deadly firearm to  stop the random attack, and simultaneously shout:  "Bite lead you old hag, it ain't your lucky day today!  This is Freedom Arms .454 Casull Magnum!  60% more powerful than Clint Eastwood's .44 Magnum!  So, you just made my day!"|`|aDG8EteIaa	A ^_^|`|RNpaBwxzaa	E) Take the bag away from her, throw it away, then call the old folks home to see if they're missing anyone.|`|vgcY5jHuaa	C. I'm not taking that ****. From ANYONE.|`|427474e9b9e4f46a16d65e677dc54d68aa	LMAO... you and your crazy, hilarious scenarios!  You're too much some times Misti... but I love it.  Gives me a good laugh!  ^_^    D) I can't take that from gram... I'd have to use her as a human pinata using her bag full of bricks as the stick.  Who knows... maybe some special surprises will come spilling out.    What's with all the violent old ladies nowadays?    You're right she is old... she is going to expire soon anyhow.  I'm just making it happen sooner.  It's best to abuse an elder when they are older... because they can't fight back... right (most of the time anyhow)?

The first generation type (i.e. Corona [1] [2] and Zenit) took photographs then ejected canisters of photographic film, which would descend to earth. Corona capsules were retrieved in mid-air as they floated down on parachutes.     Later spacecraft had digital imaging systems and downloaded the images via encrypted radio links.    In the United States, most information available is on programs that existed up to 1972. Some information about programs prior to that time are still classified, and a small trickle of information is available on subsequent missions.     A few up-to-date reconnaissance satellite images have been declassified on occasion, or leaked, as in the case of KH-11 photographs which were sent to Jane's Defence Weekly in 1985.

440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	Agreed! Yes, she put on a little weight but so what? I think she looks beautiful! Well, besides the fact that the outfit she's wearing in all the "fat" photos would look atrocious on anyone, she's still a beautiful woman!|`|mggll8dRaa	Fat Never Looks Good....!!|`|MVgm17o3aa	I agree with you..If she is fat, I am obese..I am 5'7, 135 pounds|`|nqlk9iUCaa	She's gone from Anorexic to NORMAL    It's a No-No in LaLa land  *Rolls eyes*|`|NOKKtjaGaa	society is a *****|`|D58bzW4Jaa	She looks fine to me.    I bet the person that called her fat weighs about 400lbs.|`|Fa4BahPgaa	It's just because she was thinner before, and celebrities get extra attention. Poor girl.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	I don't know, the girl loves food! That's what we do in Texas- eat! At least she's not like Oprah who's 200 pounds!|`|49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	it's called hollywood.  they can't ever just let anybody be happy.|`|ab6c493f91ee96628f1337c9e7d2bfcdaa	i absolutely agree. what has this world come to????? she's soooo gorgeous. so she gained a few pounds. THAT"S LIFE. this is why all those eating disorders are appearing.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	I dont understand why people care so much about celebrity's lives...  Leave the poor people alone.|`|BsMkp3nPaa	she has no brain or talent and her whole career is based on her looks without them she's nothing...not a good actress for sure. she is not kirstie alley fat but she could lose a few if she want to remain relevant.|`|0cMVKUnAaa	I think it proves how ridiculous our society is. I like her better now and she is making a great statement|`|54P0TxR5aa	Unfortunately, yes. And it's sad. She may "look" fat to the media but I bet she's a size 2 irl and that's still hella skinny. They did that with Jen Love Hewitt, and she was a 2 and ppl called her fat. Sick **** right there.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	1) People can be real jerks   2) Hollywood and the media set nearly impossible standards of "beauty" that have warped people's minds.    Jessica Simpson is not fat...she's gorgeous.  I'll admit that the outfit she had on was hideous, though.|`|20dfea55369b7c48d3aa2ed4fee31352aa	I think she is amazing. & half the people saying crap are no better looking than her. There just jealous.|`|P2Txzhxnaa	I don't think she got fat.     Everyones just freaking out because ZOMG!!11 CELEBRITYS CAN GAIN WEIGHT TOO!>@!K@LUWDSA|`|gYYGyYUAaa	i think people are more fond of the fact that she's a normal human being.|`|hlGXhHg3aa	We fat people will accept her if the hollywood/media thin dbags don't want her anymore...I still think she's hot lol...hollywood wants to kill everyone by making anorexia a lifestyle.  Jessica Simpson has and does look great and dare I say it normal|`|A15bfvkBaa	Yea in their world getting fat is a sin.  They are freakin retarded.  They should leave her alone..  Ugh.|`|NPwOxS3eaa	They will try to make a big deal out of anything they can get their hands on.        I actually think the photo looked like it was edited though.|`|2FJo1QgWaa	She's still sexy as hell. People need to get over it.|`|Ux9lRTaSaa	I'm not a fan of Jessica Simpson, but she is NOT fat, she just wore something that didn't flatter her figure.  Hollywood is f*cked up, they think you need to weigh 90 lbs to look good.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	I clicked on this thinking it was going to be an intelligent discourse on how sickening it is that pop culture news gets more attention than world affairs that really affect us all.     My mistake.|`|vZqYUZk1aa	first she is heavy but whatever now she was never anorexic  the funny thing is who knocks her down and who tries to defend her    its all about life, everyone is loved unconditionally by Jesus    it is ruff being in the spotlight    and hell has nothing to do with it, that is where we go if we reject Jesus as our savior and pass on in that state    David in Jesus amazing grace|`|kAsfXZzVaa	idk but it's pissing me off that they think she is fat i mean look around on the streets and some people would kill to have her body|`|d7700e32c034b0231bc54ef45dd9e791aa	I think it is bull we give of the wrong message in society to little girls.  That you can't be famous if your not a size zero.  It's crap we are all shapes and sizes and we all look good as long as we are healthy.|`|ed98cf0ff3753b1358a5edf38dc953b1aa	i don't think that she's getting fat. yea, she gained weight, so what. i don't think that it's other people's jobs to be worrying about her weight..it's hers. but i don't think she needs to be worrying about it. she looks healthy and happy and that's all that really matters, isn't it?|`|OegheALwaa	yes they are trying to turn everyone anorexic.   they are stupid i hate hollywood but at the same time i like it =]|`|OKTMuTO5aa	i don't know but her sister was dead mad about it|`|W8YnDdUoaa	its hollywood , what do you expect    good thing i dont live there|`|AA10901855	I agree she still looks better than half of them...but that's Hollywood for you...you're either too fat or too thin...there's no pleasing them.|`|4vCVyeOaaa	I don't think she is fat at all. YES, she is more than what, a size 2? Is there something wrong with that? Since she isn't very tall, I'd say she can't weigh more that 140. And she can't be more than a size 6 or 8. But, I have to agree that in the pictures of her that have become so widespread, the outfit isn't helping anything. I don't think that would look so hot on any skinny person either. I believe that if she was wearing something more flattering, she would look FANTASTIC. But of course, everyone would still shout all kinds of ridicule because she doesn't have the body of an anorexic.

HyUE9ON0aa	Well it all depends on what you mean by wrappers.      Is your mom single and has to do everything herself?    @@@@    Never mind you said food wrappers. :D    @@@@|`|I2I843Myaa	No offense to her, but she's probably insane.|`|AkPkrTf1aa	Sounds like my mom and your mom would be best friends.  Not normal at all.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	are you my sister?  no seriously she gets along with my mom like that.  shes 17 and without her license.  she's probably hormonal or has issues other than you that just got brought out somehow.  your room and you could only be one aspect of whatever is bothering her.  when she comes back to normal, you could talk with her about it.  maybe she is projecting dissapoinment in her life on you, i don't know.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Well at least Mom didnt find a half pint of booze under your bed.. like i did my youngest son. Father and me flew off the handle with that.. She is intense and i blame it all on hormones.. she must be going through PMS or something..chill out girl one of these days you will be going through the same thing with your own child.Blow your nose she will get better ..Know that MOm is going through something and she was just taking it out on you.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Please know that none of this is "on you", and you should not take it personally.  You were the closest person, at the time your mom needed to vent.  Now if you had not been there in the room at the time, that would be cause for concern!  :D  I am a mom of six and still have one at home,(17), bless her little heart!  She get the brunt end of a whole lot of my frustration.  And I am glad she is not here to comment!  Moms need a sounding board, just like everyone else.  It is our children who catch most of it.  Just try to let it bounce off and be as understanding as you can.  One day, she will not be there anymore and you're gonna miss her.  She may sound like a screaming meanie sometimes, but she does love you more than you know.  :D|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	idk|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I think you should get her some help! I mean like have her sent to the nut house or something because that is so NOT right in the head.|`|LfGQjuZnaa	Yea that's a little intense. Maybe try talking to her and seeing maybe if she is just having a bad day.|`|qtjFD2qqaa	Yes, but I think all moms are.|`|m7Y10ojiaa	If you've honestly done nothing wrong, then YES.|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	Stress can make one do abnormal things.

Thats really abnormal. She should get some help|`|8DLpCRnPaa	just a bit|`|20dfea55369b7c48d3aa2ed4fee31352aa	Welcome to my life. Maybe she is going through metapause or pregnant. lmao|`|RzhbINzeaa	I'd tell her that's why I can't tell you anything, you're blowing up at little sh!t now (cleaning the room, not the s3x part).|`|wkvrBVMAaa	...pms?    Or menopause..  x]|`|Xnmkdim0aa	yes.|`|2mla6m51aa	Maybe she is worried about something and she has to take it out on someone i guess she chose you just go along with it. Ask her if she needs anyhting or CALL A DOCTOR!|`|MFhQrOyuaa	maybe shes on her period.  O.o|`|kAsfXZzVaa	no she is just a mom|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	Yes, she is mentally unstable.|`|cujdVIdXaa	Ya she's probably either crazy or going through a "female event" such as pregnancy or menopause that causes her to yell at little frightened children in the morning|`|cKbeUeUeaa	She's on drugs !|`|QmWzBERjaa	Yes. she might just be having a really bad day or PMS. But for real if she does this on a regular basis then you need o tell someone so she can get help.|`|AA11535009	You know that Mothers can be Evil Tyrants at times, but you know they always have your best intentions at heart. At least your showing some responsibly by protecting yourself from unfortunate accidents. This thing I know will NEVER change, Children hide things/Parents find out. You want to seem Responsible? Get a job, take away her ability to hang things over your head. Be independent, then YOU do what you want. Isn't this what she really wants you to do anyways? Think about it. Good Luck Dval|`|tqBy3vXvaa	Well has she done this to you before? If not then something must of happened or she's going through menopause. Maybe..just maybe PMS. Keep away from her and get her whatever she needs. I wouldn't dare try talking to her. But that's just me. If she wants to talk ok,but don't start a conversation.|`|bxEAWGIoaa	there's nothing wrong with your mom ....look in.the mirror the problem is staring you in the face.....seamanab|`|jP4fuOwRaa	She crazy, For Shooooow. Maybe something happened earlier that made her that way and she doesn't feel like talking about it...soooo she took it out on you =0! or she's just crazy :0 most likely something happened lol.

440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	Yup. My grandfather paid the down payment on my mom's new car in cash. It may look a bit suspicious but it'll be worth it when you see the look on the dealer's face when you pull out a wad of cash.|`|AA10724468	I'm pretty sure some shady dealership or anyone at this point (recession) will let it happen.|`|frwlypDWaa	Absolutely. Money talks, nobody walks...|`|lbB4lq6Daa	yea i paid my Jeep in cash|`|8PhOCtcZaa	yeah, but they might be suspicious|`|a1ymHaWAaa	yeah|`|vRmsvSb6aa	Yeah. I bought my last car with cash. They will usually go down on the price if you do it that way.|`|bWNyWXrSaa	Just take the caa' straight from the lot.  Take it on a joyriiiide.|`|4c5726b963122e60694b7e3e59161e71aa	Yes, Cash is whole lot better then credit!|`|y7lUgd3aaa	Yes you can!  My aunt paid for her car entirely in cash.  That would actually be the wise thing to do because you wouldn't have any interest.|`|oDUuAs9Raa	Cors you can....expect to arouse some suspicion though,especially if the car is of significant value...ie:Drug dealer,mafia man,etc.|`|IiB6nXn5aa	Of coarse you can. As bad as car sells are right now you could get a great deal with cash. They probably will kiss you feet if you asked.|`|AA11535009	Yeah, actually if you pay in cash you might even get the car for cheaper. Don't let the car dealer know how much you've really got. Shoot for a lower price to begin and see if you can't make the price stick. You know the old saying-money talks. Good Luck Dval.
KdRQqdvRaa	Scary Movie 1 & 2 by Keenen Ivory, Shawn and Marlon Wayans plus Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer among others.    Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans - by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg.    Scary Movie 3 & 4 by David Zucker & Craig Mazin among others.    Superhero Movie by Graig Mazin.    Dance Flick by Damien Wayans plus Keenan Ivory, Marlon, Shawn and Craig Wayans.    So, you can say that Dance Flick and the first two Scary Movies are by the Wayans brothers; that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer started as writers there and went off to do their own movies afterwords (4 of them); while Scary Movies 3 and 4 and the Superhero Movie are by different people...

GK3wBfTHaa	Dakota Fanning may not be saying much about joining the cast of the Twilight sequel, but yesterday she did confirm she's in talks to play Jane!    As I exclusively reported last week, the 14-year-old child star has been offered the role of the young killer bloodsucker in the movie adaptation of New Moon, the second book in Stephenie Meyer's bestselling teenage vampire series.     "It's definitely possible. I really hope it works out," Fanning told Hitfix.com while promoting her latest flick Push. "It would be a really fantastic experience I'm sure."    Director Chris Weitz is so confident that Fanning is right for the part, he offered it to without even an audition. Filming of the much-anticipated flick begins in March in the U.S. and Italy.    A member of the deadly Volturi, Jane is described in a casting notice as a petite blonde with a "Botticelli angel-like face[and] crimson irises."    An online petition to cast Fanning as Jane has seen a huge bump in signatures ever since my story broke on Wednesday.    A rep for the studio, Summit Entertainment, reportedly confirmed Fanning is one of the actors being considered for the role.     If it happens, Fanning will join returning stars Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner, among others. New Moon is set to open in November.|`|CxCT5sEVaa	Dakota Fannings is going  to play Jane, shes in the Volteri.|`|Pl7J5HFMaa	She would be playing Jane from the Vloturi coven  i love Twilight and Edward!

676XZjUYaa	The Wii version of Guitar Hero 3 doesn't have downloadable songs. Because the Wii doesn't have a hard drive to store content, there's no place for the Wii console to keep these songs once they are downloaded.    The new Guitar Hero World Tour game has introduced downloadable songs for the Wii, although there won't be as many songs released on the Wii version as there will be for the XBox 360 and PS3 versions of the game. Because of the storage issues on the Wii, songs will also only be downloadable as single songs (for around 200 points per song) as opposed to the 3-song track packs on the other consoles.    The downloadable songs from Guitar Hero World Tour won't be playable on Guitar Hero 3 due to the way the songs are licensed by the music companies.

z9TRqHLRaa	I liked the maple syrup gag, that was funny.     Don't be nervous, if you want to keep creating comedy films, I recommend reading the following books:    Save The Cat!  The 8 Characters of Comedy  Cinematic Storytelling    There are a ton of other books you should read, but start with those and you'll get even better results from your efforts.    There's also a great site called Indy Mogul, they have great advice for novice filmmakers.    Good luck!  Steve

uttbqGB9aa	Its more of a joke with an interpretation behind it.  people will definitely hurt you in life. It may be for no reason at all.  Even though it may take a long time..you will eventually heal and get over it.    Now, once you heal...you may even come back to get hurt again. Either you are a fighter or just dumb, but regardless, you come back for more so whats left to say is, after all that...what the **** is your problem!?    :) Cool joke by the way.|`|sQlImMnCaa	i would say it is a man who is cruel to gods creations.|`|MUcaYL0Paa	whats the riddle?|`|Nglxezz1aa	how is this a riddle ?     btw nice joke lol|`|qbnKOsZoaa	it kinda weird.|`|uvOhOUllaa	the answer to your riddle? you're an idiot.|`|mohxk30laa	thats a riddle?|`|f2e71f6Gaa	what??!!? im a little bit confused what the hell was that all about???|`|LMtvmRh6aa	I dont get it??!!??|`|bLsWEpDFaa	i think that was a waste of time (;|`|IzVMG59Jaa	lol dude this is from the movie training day.i've seen it a bunch of times and it is so funny when the guy said it.hilarious man.if surprising how many people don't know this.|`|CoTsKzPFaa	I don't get it?!?!|`|YJcd8OAeaa	whats the question?|`|1ZfkQBg3aa	Riddle??

HFEotT1Qaa	Avoid the whole thing, make them buy you something else maybe from Olive Garden.    If you're honestly a vegetarian, you wouldn't support fast-food chains, the way they torture those animals is just horrid.    Edit: If you're getting dragged there, try not eating at all...If your parents even care about you, they'll care and respect your wishes.    It's a bit extreme, but it will work for sure.    Or eat something at home without letting them know and pretend like you're not eating.    Good Luck|`|esMek8nWaa	MEAT! Become Vegan, did you know they are allowed to eat meat on Fridays'?|`|ChwKz1qyaa	tell them that its not fair that they can enjoy there food while you cant cause there's no good vegetarian choices.  ask them if you can pick a spot to eat out, google vegetarian restaurants in your areas.    good luck!    answer mine?|`|LfoH1ivlaa	The fries are not vegetarian friendly.  Anything fried isn't actually. I'm sure they don't have a separate fryer/care enough to keep meat products separate from everything else. Both of those restaurants do have a vegetarian burger option. Good luck.|`|hl1ewPh1aa	VEGETABLES!  Don't go out to a restaurant or anywhere like that just go out to a garden! LOL or a steakhouse|`|C53stbyFaa	Try eating at a Lebanese place, they have tons of Vegetarian options|`|jZD2z7Tyaa	Erm... try places that do pasta, or pizza! Just encourage your family to try new places maybe.    Usually they do stuff like fruit extras, and veggie burgers, ask their v. options, they should have something you like, dont be afraid to ask, I do!     Good luck :) x|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	I don't get how a vegetarian dosen't like salad! Odd. Those places usually offer a veggie burger or some kind of option.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	some like fish,i do not eat meat but i eat fish only for protein and omega-3|`|Qih2hKqkaa	The healthiest option would be to start eating meat!|`|a31kUn1Naa	Yeah pretty much anything from fast food places are bad.    I agree with the first answer: If you are a true vegetarian you wouldn't support those types of places.    Explain to your parents the situation and hopefully they will listen. If not. Eat at home.|`|pR1rp3huaa	subway!! :P :)|`|tvdabilNaa	Nothing at those restaurants.  Even items they promote as healthy aren't healthy.  Try going for pizza or little ethnic restaurants.  They will be about same price point and better for you.

Here's some interesting info on the Super Bowl ads:  http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,...  where it says: "Viewers need a pair of 3-D glasses, which can be found for free at grocery and convenience stores nationwide."     Maybe call around your neighborhood stores to see who carries them.  (I'd guess your local 7-Eleven carries them).    oh and btw, in case you missed it...the TV show "Chuck" on NBC Monday at 8 p.m. is also being presented in 3D so, use your glasses for that also.

We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.     ESCAPEE  Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE)  Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH  Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME  Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER  Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)  Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS  Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR  Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH  Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE  Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON  Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET  Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.    UNCLE TED  Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.    FLY BY  Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.|`|fQghpx3Zaa	Grundel  (3rd definition)    My friends and I joked about that forever.

The main reason is because I cant imagine who would have sex with her! The kids they have now are adopted|`|Yqrb7feeaa	She is not pregnant.  You received some poor information.  I can not say with any certainty that she will not try to get pregnant again, but I would highly doubt it given the already tremendous amount of responsibility on her and her husband.|`|u6EJnaVpaa	I think her vagina has teeth and it is like getting a BJ so she cant get pregnant

It's nervous habit.|`|5EPzQSh5aa	No, only if  you  bit the piece  of skin  from  someone elses  finger and eat  it.    If  you start doing that , I know of a good cook book  entitled ,  How  to Cook Four  People.     It was written  by Jeffery Dahmer .|`|CkhAD1Pcaa	No, but maybe a carnivore... idk

Okay, well this really big youknowwhat parked her car in the school parking lot (student section) & this guy I know decided to go pee on her car, because if you knew her...You probably would too.     It was the middle of winter, and it froze onto her hood.    Anyways, she confronted me and said "I know you dumped soda on my car, I tasted it."      HAHAHA, I still laugh.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	I don't do pranks but someone did one to me years ago that stuck with me.I waitressed in this small restaurant and these kids put fake vomit on the table and dumped coffee around it then called me over to clean it up I thought I was going to throw up until they let me in on their joke.|`|lbB4lq6Daa	told him that walmart made him manager and he went there and asked for his award and stuff and they just stared at him|`|3BX15PwBaa	Putting tape on the bottom of the mouse censor.|`|hsvgllTwaa	nothing but plan on doing this..     http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=1I5zDy34VF...    lol|`|M7UX9qamaa	i like to give people wrappers that have nothing in them..like gum wrappers. its really easy and simple.  i like to pull peoples chairs out from under them     i basically do things that just come to me in the moment; things that dont take any planning  :]|`|qxHwSQTHaa	One time when I was in middle school I called my mom up on April fools day from my school office and I sounded like I was crying and said.. mom I broke my arm, I feel down the stairs and I broke my arm and it hurts really bad and they need you to come so you can take me to the hospital... and I played it out for a few minutes then said April fools and she was like THATS NOT FUNNY!   lol I am mean.. ;[  I also once sent her an e-card saying I was pregnant and then it said at the end.. just kidding.

Second.., "a better balanced combination"    So, yeah, there is limit...  ..and it is the perfect balance of measurements...|`|98kiNkgEaa	The second one is hot.  And boobs have to be, umm that p word yeah, porportionate to the body to be hot. The second one is kind of big but still hot.  Yeah    Bye|`|HFEotT1Qaa	I actually don't like big boobs...

I will just got with first person..|`|c8TXAAj1aa	That first chick needs a reduction. Doctors would probably do that **** pro bono.|`|VD3M8izdaa	I personally find little attraction or distraction from women's chests.    Its only excess skin.. filled with fats. Yay?|`|GbnLmdzTaa	I'm not a guy, but the first pair looks deadly. She could probably kill a man with those.|`|FRp7lXwKaa	yes there is a limit like when a girl gets top heavy or there sort|`|uIrQkesbaa	who says every guy likes boobs? i'm more of an *** man, not big ***' though. haha. but when it comes to boobs I like smaller ones. Not flat boobs but nice ones. haha. that first pic scared me!, the second one was better. haha|`|nON6Qdwpaa	yes...at least for the normal guy theres a limit..but u never know|`|qMXk1GRgaa	omg, i think i almost died when i saw the 1st photo. DAMN!    - i think the boobs doesnt matter, as long as they fit the girls shape, its fine with me :D *Drools*|`|5YTkGB5yaa	The second pic is more to my liking|`|vYs5j3Xnaa	I like them smaller than the second pick.|`|2LpWgU20aa	ew is that first picture real? if so, i feel bad for that girl, that must be heavy to carry around.|`|f2f1533543e03966253e5dfdc62b7b19aa	i only care if my boobs are a nice size|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	They can be rated.  -There's cute boobs  -There's voluptuous boobs  -There's grotesque boobs    Yes there is a limit.|`|LlMS9NsSaa	:) Yeah.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	to me both are too big!!!|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Erm,i don't know what to say,i like the second set better but i would still suck on the first set.|`|UdwIaCxBaa	Boobs are boobs in Ol'Joker's eyes    : )|`|8aa2f76f19d65cc5bc682422bda1ee49aa	UGH!        the first 1 leaves very little to the imagination.

So when fat chicks BRAG that they have big boobs, it annoys me.  Cuz they are usually big everywhere else.  Now thin girls like the second and myself usually had help. There is nothing wrong with that, and to tell you the truth? I don't think men really care about that.  As long as they get to touch, they are happy in the end.  Now, Kim Kardashian has had hers done. It is obvious. Looks great and I applaud her. But keep in mind, these "ideal" types are costly, painful and do not always feel natural. Is it worth it? Depends on the individual. I like mine. I like me. Liked me before, too.      Second, to answer your inquiry.|`|fOf4pjBQaa	Second one is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... better but it isn't all about size. Some girls have B cups but they look huge because of the proportion between the size of their body and their breasts.|`|HE3IkyL8aa	I like B-C cups. Just because A's are too small, and some D's look too big. Then anything above that (as seen in your pictures) is kinda iffy or weird.|`|i8EcDMdZaa	eww thats fkin nasty i mean wtf she carry them or somat? 2nd one|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	not all men like big boobs.....just slighly bigger than the average...with good shape.....is more important    :  )

GkH5NoFyaa	That is a hostile working environment. Contact your HR department. If that goes no where, call the feds; eeoc. They will investigate.|`|jfwmelYgaa	Well.....I would find out personal information  about the captain and spread it around work , **** like that spreads very quickly and people wouldn't take him very seriously and laugh at him behind his back, I doubt if he would like that very much...fight fire with fire....but don't get caught.|`|gWleYSuIaa	I would quit that job - and i would sue the captain.
CvtDsOB4aa	Yes I Remember 2000 Well|`|dMBSE8ilaa	Oh you mean like next year, when people will start calling it twenty-ten? I don't know what I'm gonna call it, I think I'll alternate between twenty-ten and twothousand-ten|`|lzTUEtppaa	So, instead of saying twenty ten, you're going to say 'two thousand and ten'?    So, in the 1990's did you call 1997 'one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven'?    I'm going with the twenty ten business.

So, I'd order the salad.|`|qqptguPJaa	something not expensive    not a salad but not a steak    probably something with chicken    cause it's probably good.|`|vXOreO4Uaa	Well I'm not the type of girl that is shy to eat so i would order like  the biggest piece of steak over a salad any day.  :D|`|0L0llku8aa	I would order something in between, cause why not eat for free when I can, right?|`|9MRSjkkxaa	Gay soo no guyy but when i go out with a girl i get what i want. I wouldnt order a lot because that is rude but i wouldnt get like nothing.|`|2pcxRWX9aa	i definitely don't get a salad i only like one salad and that's my mothers and i definitely get my grub on because no matter what i eat i don't get fat :) plus i love food and when i want to eat what i want im going to eat it.    and no its not rude to get what you want to eat.  sorry i just had to edit to say that to that 1 girl lol|`|qDctmJTeaa	well I really like to eat     but .. I'm a vegetarian so I'd get the salad.. or a vegetarian dish .. doesn't mean it's a small one lol.|`|uQaVvVHtaa	i mos def dont order a salad! but i don't order the most expensive thing on the menu. But i'll get my grub on some meat/chicken. A girl's gotta eat! lol|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	well, if its the guy taht i think i'm going to go out with (soon :)!!!) then i'll order something medium because he aready sees what i eat for lunch everyday so why would dinner be different?  but if it was some other guy, maybe something lighter, but not a salad    i would be nervous, so i wouldn't eat a lot|`|93dRdE3gaa	well most of the time i just order a burger and fries reguardless of where we are    but i guess if we go somewhere with a buffet i atleast get everything i think looks good, but not always in the portions i want|`|MmfMJq9Paa	depends if i am hungry or not,  usually, I will get steak and salad. I don't go to expensive places either, Alot of other places have  great portions and reasonable prices.|`|k1Aio2qdaa	I like to eat well....but I never take advantage of a man....especially his money|`|oLpIos42aa	i order not to small but not to big|`|FmucfdCEaa	I'm ok BMI wise but I gotta lose so small as possible|`|Rmtfm7qnaa	As a guy, I like for a woman to order whatever she wants... but it seems gross if she's just stuffing her face and rude if she orders the most expensive thing.    As a woman, I like a medium sized meal so I'm not too hungry or too stuffed... just in case|`|fAgUzXRCaa	if i wasnt hungry then i'd order a salad but most of the time i get my grub on!|`|XHRquczeaa	I don't care what he thinks of me, I'll get my grub on!    Salads usually don't fill me.|`|EcVVcgZNaa	I normally eat kinda big meals, but when I'm around people, I'm a little shy when it comes to eating something big, so I order something small. Also, I don't like to order something expensive, I try to order something cheap, so it don't cost so much.
pM1Qw0hUaa	the question's a bit weird but had to tell you that I had a chuckle at your name... haven't heard anyone called that for a few years (I moved to London from Wicklow 12 years ago) You made me smile!!|`|jMsK8lU8aa	Okay, I'm glad that I had a nice oniony burger, a cola & onion rings!|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	congrats on stopping smoking...
GkOd1hknaa	lol i get what your saying. edward's character is what a lot of people would think is appealing for a guy. his qualities like strength and protection and honesty are what a lot of girls like and that's why the develop a crush on the character. edward, to a lot of people, is the "perfect" guy.    however, i am more of a jacob person and i think the whole twilight thing is becoming a bit obsessive. i liked the books before the movie.    (haha my answer sounds so well thought)|`|UHvXTW1Gaa	shure  orange|`|DjbCw7ePaa	I would prefer my own Superman.|`|8X4Lxteeaa	ummmm no i'm not in love with him... i mean, he is just so protective of bella, and personally that would drive me crazy... and he's too perfect, and i know there isn't anyone out there that's gonna be nearly as perfect as him, and so i guess just that fact doesn't really make me have a crush on him. and he doesn't exsist, also.... and maybe you will find the closest person to edward in MI :)      ORANGE JUICE.|`|F9UToz4aaa	Buy an Edward Cullen action figure. At least he'll be with you forever. At least, till you run out of AA batteries. ENERGIZER BUNNY!  Orange|`|XTWClFLQaa	Yes, ofc.  But without the whole vampire thing..  Orange juice!|`|HFEotT1Qaa	Twilight feeds on girls with emotional issues, the more Twilight questions the more my point is being justified.    Edit: At least you're honest about it, because of Twilight women now have ^^^^^^^ Standards and are more insecure.    I hate this movie with a passion|`|QIlhmWwBaa	hahaha this is sad and pathetic i hope people say yes so i can laugh more|`|H9gmJYdmaa	No.  That character is a f-cking stalker.|`|KiXxv95Vaa	Ehh, if it happens it happens.    Poll: Orange Juice.|`|XqmJKlmwaa	YES I DO WISH THERE WAS A VAMPIRE EDWARD CULLEN OUT THERE    when i moved to forks(im serious i actually live in forks)  i was praying that that would happen to me  but it didnt    i imagine it all the time        I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!    oh and orange|`|sXD19xN8aa	haha you don't sound that lame. I bet a lot of people think the same way you do.    Apparently I'm not one of those people. Probably because I'm just 13 and I don't  get obsessive with anything. Of course, twilight was a good book. The movie wasn't that bad either, in my opinion. They can't make a 4 hour movie. lol, probably you won't find a vampire anywhere, I'll say that. But I'm pretty sure you'll find "your edward cullen" someday.     I like orange juice better.|`|8a1d6ccf0d0d55393c413e0362906d9eaa	well...i know one day that i will find my "edward cullen" and i can't wait!!!! i know theres someone perfect out there just waiting for me, and he's waiting for me...:D just can't wait....and im so happy to know that there is someone out there...my soul mate! *faints*

A week before my birthday, my uncle passed away, so my mom had to go to New York, and she wasn't there for my birthday.  We also couldn't really celebrate it, so I just bought a small cake from DQ.  Then my little brother ate 3/4 of the cake =|    But it's ok! because for my 17th birthday, I'm going to Europe!  =D|`|vKrWrhQeaa	my friend forgot it :(    but she made up for it by throwing me a surprise party that same weekend...it was lots of fun :)
MZF4l1Umaa	the only way it could possibly help, is fretting finger dexterity, and fretting and picking synchronization.|`|HyKcvCDOaa	She's either lying or playing really easy songs on her actual guitar. No it doesn't help at all. I play bass guitar and I suck at guitar hero, same with my brother only he plays guitar......|`|f3D6RkrEaa	No - it will help your hand -eye co-ordination but seen as you press coloured keys as thats what are on screen it doesnt teach you chords etc.|`|gWYuOgw0aa	No, not if you wanna learn how to play guitar properly.|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	Nope, it's totally different technique|`|ld1hfx70aa	it will only help with hand eye coordination.  if anything it will hinder because you are playing with your fingers differently and at a different time|`|T8B23z2Yaa	no. i play guitar and the only thing it MIGHT do for you is making your fingers more loose and flexible.|`|3WhNqZ36aa	no, it'll only help your coordination (like the other people said). but if you wanna learn to properly play guitar, take lessons.  i'm pretty good at guitar and i tried guitar hero and i sucked!

YeFt3IEUaa	It is a great book! I'm sure some rockers do like it. Maybe it just doesn't fit with their "image".|`|VmXq5NCOaa	WRONG SECTION!!|`|3WCXGRaGaa	wrong area!! AND QUTIE POSTING. GET A BLOG PLEASE!|`|38Y4FAOGaa	I love twilight! It's sooo awesome. Some people find it girly or only see the girly side of it but its not really like that i dont rekon.|`|Z2pcxMdFaa	I personally hated the book. It was boring and terribly written, I wish people would get over it.|`|gM9RguFeaa	i like it,  and it's just a book,  anyone could like it.    (i hate how Edward look s in the movie tho)|`|wgCwEYzXaa	no. thats......not true at all. i take on multiple personalites. i dont look or act girly but i am in some ways.....and i loved Twilight.....it doesnt matter what u look or act like. i noe so many people who loved that book, it just depends on the way u thinkk. so it may not mean if ur a 'rocker' u dont like Twilight. thats like saying emo people dont like makeup....when in actuality, its what they wear......hopefully u can see through my point of view.=]|`|Q4yDLqR2aa	I don't think so. It all depends on the person and what she/he likes. I personally love Twilight and can't get enough of it. But it still depends on the person. It's like whether people like red apples or green apples.|`|ifNx6qu8aa	Not really. It depends on people's tastes and choices when It comes to books. To be honest, I've heard people saying that rockers should like it since it has vampires in it, but because a group of people that have the same qualities/dress alike get labeled a lot, they often have to deal with assumptions on what they should like vs what they do like.  It really depends on the person - since  something as simple as a label doesn't necessarily mean everyone likes the exact same things.|`|JKQGy2aZaa	twlight is not that great get over it ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  if your looking for a way better vampire story read vampire knight     and this is the wrong place to ask that question|`|o6K4Dr5Daa	Post it to a rightful SECTION!!!!

Or b) I will turn around and say what I feel meaning I will get in his or her face and tell them off.

Just kidding.    Pfftt, then I attack back. (Verbally that is)|`|Fu75rNIvaa	i'll defend myself as much as possible.. but i'd talk calmly to make myself look like the more mature person than the person verbally abusing me!.. this makes them feel like an idiot.|`|j9H1emNGaa	I either she "Whatever" and act like they never said it or say "That's what she said!" |`|EZzCqUWKaa	I got used to it as I had a father who was verbally, emotionally abusive. Became numb to it as soon as I turned 17. Now when someone talks down to me, I can literally feel the adrenaline in my blood rushing, like I'm gonna smash their face in. I've learned to control it though. I am now calm and collective with it but I know when to shut them up so they don't walk all over me. I'll fight back and take them out though if I had to. Depending. Sometimes that's what a person wants from you when they verbally attack you. So I don't give them what they want. Not a reaction, nothing. I'm good at reading people though so I can tell if they want a reaction from me or not. All thanks to an abusive father, at least I gained something from those experiences though.|`|T3DLgs6Vaa	Honestly I'll say F*** You because it probably was an argument.|`|76dfb34e84a5375f6ceb56a8f30f239faa	I 'verbally attack' them back!  I am actually the queen of comebacks! Never mess with me 'coz I can always make you look like a fool!!!!!!|`|9mPux1fFaa	Mostly I laugh at them. Or stay really calm because a retort said in a quiet voice always makes them look like an idiot.  Having said that, I don't want to blow my own trumpet or anything but I am quite quick and articulate so I always end up winning a verbal argument anyway.|`|gdgpweJoaa	Attack them back, their not perfect|`|iQ7ubBAfaa	minor insults i respond to by stalking the person for a few weeks, following them around, talking to people they know, figuring our what i can do to completely ruin their life, and then doing it at the moment when it will cause most damage    major insults i just laugh off and let go|`|wZYs1Nz6aa	Punch them.|`|OdovbvSYaa	kick them in the goolies then run away|`|w8tM5lFiaa	LOL|`|61704ecd7110569d54ceeff103c4b277aa	i don't get verbally attacked either. i think its a good thing, cause who wants to be yelled at all the time.

I tend to veer to the old. What usually one has difficulty finding. I don't like comedy. Unless it is really worth seeing. But someone told me of the Perez Family, not too old I believe - perhaps new in the 90's. It is about 2 Cuban immigrants who fall in love, in a way neither one expected. She from having had grief touch her, and truthfully discovering what a really caring man he is, and He from finally appreciating her depth and goodness, when she displays this grief for another. It is a comedy/drama, I suppose...but I've rented several times. The protagonists are; Marisa Tomeii, as the wild but determined to succeed, Cuban girl. And Alfred Molina, who is a British actor, although he is a master at assuming perfect accents to all the varied characters he plays. It may be worth granting it your time.  Hope to have helped.  Good Luck!  Grecia.|`|P2BjtJnUaa	"death at a funeral" very funny

AA10222223	Swing Dancing, by far!  That's both East Coast & Lindy Hop.  I also love West Coast (almost identical to "The Push" or Sugar Push)  which is kind of a swing as is Jitterbug.      I also love ballroom & Latin.  Country (especially the Progressive) can be great if you can find a great leader, but most guys just want to walk me around the dance floor.  I love the swings, spins & especially the DIPS. ("WEEEEE")|`|fb91421a01fc02be41baf0dfc3bbc7a7aa	Danny Kaye and the blonde over the bridge just outside the nightclub in White Christmas!|`|AA11766295	I don't know if I have a favorite.

The metal detector is set off by a relatively large area of metal (it is inducing a currentin the metal). Even a large number of gold teeth (or metal crowns) will not set the detector off. Similarly a small belt buckle (like mine) does not set the detector off but a large one (like the cowboys wear) does set it off.|`|f806a03843f9ead7087449999b81a841aa	I don't know about quanitiy, but I don't think that gold jewlery sets it off or most married people would have to remove their wedding bands as most are gold.|`|78888423fb955f93cb2ea858ae49ca9faa	i have no clue lol

ouEix2a2aa	It is a pretty scary stunt. A truly great stunt always has that element of fear in there somewhere. Especially that fall. You usually never see a stunt involving a fall from a height after they've reached it. Definitely a unique one.|`|IL4AW7nnaa	Guy has to have a set of steelies?|`|31807a7b79617cfb2bc1b66ff89d23a5aa	i would have laughed if he smashed into the wall....|`|pR1rp3huaa	Whoa! That's awesome!!

VERrlErvaa	It really depends on the quality and source of the non-Fiction story and how it has been adapted.  There are a lot of good little gems out there, but they are hard to find.  Some of them have the 'Z' grade cast; with an occasional big name in it to give it some clout - but when they are found - the good ones can be a total trip.    Then there's the stuff that is "Based on a true story..."  Not quite either - it's in the middle and the truth is stretched to breaking point ("The Perfect Storm")... Or some of the horror flicks; the suspense type, not the gore ones.    I do love the fiction stuff, because it is not limited by the imagination at all - you can just switch your brain off and enjoy a good story (or laugh your head off at something which is meant to be taken seriously - see any film by Uwe Boll.)    Reality movies can be very therapeutic and cathartic as well.    Still, I think I am more of a general movie fan overall...  I like both sides.|`|gbm71puSaa	I prefer fiction. Its nice to escape the non-fiction world for a while|`|zzUNjpinaa	It definitely adds to the movie if there is some truth behind it, so I'd say Non-Fiction.|`|PwKE009uaa	both|`|zPdG0SDeaa	Fiction.  Though most movies are based on some event in real life.|`|zdIQTA9Yaa	non mainly because i like WWII movies (best is defiance)|`|hrGuLYVnaa	i love both|`|NQiYKFzxaa	Well,it depends on your talent really because i might not be like you at all.I would preferto watch fiction, but it also depends on what movie it is so do be honest, both.|`|cbV3FlDFaa	fiction|`|j06SPzuhaa	fiction|`|tLI94qWNaa	I prefer a bit of both, life would be boring without both of them.|`|3kNeWYvdaa	I love fiction movies! Like Lord of the Rings! Batman! Harry Potter!  Although occasionally I do watch non-fiction movies this may be weird but I like this religious movie called Joan of Arc:)|`|AA10894901	Aren't they really just the same depending upon your point of view?|`|4fKk6t6maa	Depends on what mood I'm in, but usually fiction. Documentaries can be oddly intriguing at times (very rare times though).

I have amazingly healthy teeth without fillings or anything.  One of my cousins actually had to have all of his baby teeth pulled out at the age of six because they were so rotten!  His mother is one of those women who refuse to cook a meal... it's sad really.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Yep they're all mine.|`|C2sZREuAaa	Herb is a wife beater.  He punched mine out long time ago.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	yes|`|nkmwGAKjaa	Most are crowned, but they are all MINE! lol|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	No, unfortunately.  When I was a kid my parents took me to a "friend of the family" dentist........ translated:  cheapest.  He filled my mouth with lots of big gray metal fillings.    Well, now, most of those fillings have fallen out or needed to be replaced because they got old.      So, I have many gold on-lays, crowns, and 2 bridges in my mouth.  Not to mention that all my wisdom teeth  have been pulled in my twenties.    Did you know my dentist now charges $1000 for a crown?  Good grief!!|`|mBlcD6sRaa	yes all of them|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	I have a couple missing but the rest are still there yes.  I even got 2 extra Wisdom teeth that I could do without.

I like to imagine it still going up and down in the lift to the top of the eiffel tower. Looking wistfully out of the window and wishing the rain would stop.

AA10671636	...actually it is based on the guy who Judas Priest recruited to replace Rob Halford when he left the band. He was a guy in some local Judas Priest cover band, that they decided to use.   Apparently, the experiment lasted about one album, and one tour. However, some one felt the need to make a film about this relative speck on the history of music.   (....but Jennifer Anniston looked great, no?)|`|2f2d0585d2f3afc2c4a0776afc1388d2aa	Rockstar is a piece of fiction.  The songs are written for it not based on any bands.  It has about as much to do with Wylde as it does with Marky Mark and the funky Bunch.  He just had the right image for the movie.  Zakk is a pure metal guitarist and not the screaming 80s hair bands.  He's a living legend.  i think he did the movie to give it the bad *** image.|`|AA10520418	Hes in it but its not about him.

hl1ewPh1aa	One day, Ani-may was out with her friend Xena the Blue Burmese cat. They loved to have adventures together. Suddenly they found themselves on a pirate ship. 'How did we get here?' asked Ani-may. They gasped in amazement. 'Are you thinking what I'm thinking?' said her companion, and fell over. Suddenly everyone bowed down to Ani-may. They looked around for a hiding place, and just then they saw a door and ran through it. 'That was a close one' said Ani-may , the amazement clear in her voice. 'I've got an idea' said Xena the Blue Burmese cat. 'Lets get in this plane, fly to England and make good our escape.'

They are now a gray-ish yellow. But, suddenly, a crazy old man steals your father's pee stained socks. Your father, happy to be out of the socks, thanks the crazy guy and then tells you about his day.    Or, if you want a slightly sane answer (which is totally overrated if you ask me) there's a) not enough info, and b) who would wear socks in June?
vqlkecS5aa	i honestly would not reccomend doing that everyday, especially with gas prices the way they are. when gas prices lower than you can go more frequent, but for now on maybe once or twice a week? good luck! [=|`|GTsKitahaa	LOL!  You live up to your name *giggling*

DnHKZ0kGaa	Well here is the deal: once you rent a movie and sync it to your ipod, u have 30 days to start watching it, once you start it u have 24 hours to finish it or watch it multiple times, then it expires and wont let u watch it anymore.     It may sound confusing but you can look it up on apples website.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	forever!!!|`|i3pF86HNaa	24 hours.|`|utObT8QAaa	i dunno|`|AHgOj79maa	30 days if you havent watched it  24 hours if you have already|`|mzhFrm5Taa	A day. 24 hours.

AA10791843	i sugest you watch T3: Rise of the Machines. it will answer your question|`|80667f1d130b281cdceafbcae23d2bb9aa	That was the whole reason they tried to destroy the chip and first terminator's arm, to prevent Judgement Day (war).  The movies tried to stop the future from happening by going into the past.  T-3 was when Judgement Day happened and basically it showed the day the machines took over was unavoidable.  I still think the first one was the best.|`|deca3f9fc1b9e407030e6df542312669aa	There is no logic behind it at least from my point of view.

jHDeIPEfaa	Several years ago, when a contestant won and was able to play the FINAL ROUND, the contestants picked 5 consonants and 1 vowel. Most contestatnts picked R, S,T,L,and N for their consonants and E for their vowel. Now contestants are automatically given these 5 consonants and 1 vowel plus an additional 3 consonants and 1 vowel.

msNXomjTaa	My step-mom (at 68) came to visit when my daughter was 11.  I used the "imagine your grandmother with a tattoo" to try to discourage her.

646bb2fe760e5ca262fa577a58c89846aa	OK I actually saw a pre-screening of the film last night and let me tell you it is BAD. It is long and very boring, there are two action scenes in it and they last about 5 minutes each and even then they are not all that interesting, for the 2 hours and 30 plus minutes that the film is you would think that it could be a little more interesting. Most of the movie is getting re acquainted and crap like that it is slow and stupid it will not live up to the hype and that I can guarantee. I don't recommend this one at all.|`|AA11232084	MEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!|`|706fb2956b804b28c29c033162284dfaaa	me thinks its gona be gooooood :)|`|9ef0b77a8b8e0ad195bc16f0a5e92e82aa	well,they did a lot of movies about it but this movie might be cool|`|3e6ad374222d12817c671ac7538c56a0aa	me and my husband think he looks like a wimp.|`|AA12121778	"Superman" has "Jumped the shark"|`|4b782e3b5490e333a8dfc67fe519a1b3aa	Remember:  This movie is meant to be a sequel to Supes 2 (3 & 4 are thankfully being ignored).

I wouldn't go see this movie even if someone paid me to go.

Will you wake up by my side?   No she can't, 'cause she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone....     Now do i have to fall asleep with roses in my hands   Do i have to fall asleep with roses in my hands?

AA11850523	I would think so|`|5b50bc57a152398fdf0a3a7f4f7ba4f0aa	yes it stands for angel and his show is crunk with all the stunts and tricks.|`|AA12005199	i guess so|`|AA12340086	I think  it's anarchy.  meaning chaos.  But I can't remember what it looks like.    Don't buy anything from that Mind-Joke.  Please don't tell me you really believe he like......levitates and stuff.  He's an illusionist.  The root word....illusion.    If he could levitate, or levitate others do you think all that he would be doing is have some show on cable tv?  Don't you think he'd be studied or investigated.  Or at least himself doing more than just doing a few stunts on TV.    I know, I saw him levitate from one rooftop to another too....and no, I don't know how he did it.  That's why it's an illiusion.    I don't think I would hate him so much if he didn't pose like Jesus on the cross so much.  I'm not religious....it just bugs me!
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	read...  watch a movie...  bubble bath...|`|vVZLY82Iaa	I just asked the same question like a few minutes ago. If you get any ideas please tell!
L6c4wPPGaa	not really. maybe mother and daughter.  And I choose not to say who is hotter.|`|5ccu53kgaa	yeah you look like sisters. or at least cousins. i think you both are very pretty so i will not judge.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	Somewhat|`|MdXwD2JSaa	Yeah, somewhat.|`|VwtMfZMmaa	yes the one in red is better looking|`|AA10227117	little bit  yes|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	black is better looking|`|9UhoUcM2aa	yess you two LOOK like sisters...   and the one in the black is prettier.   gorgeous hair...and a pretty face.. :)|`|dpczBPuHaa	Yeah, you sorta do. But I'm not gonna answer the second part because hey, my opinion doesn't matter I'm just a stranger.|`|MfyMZAgkaa	Nahh. Kind of, but not really.|`|nGxrvQavaa	No you don't look like sisters, and both are pretty in their own way, but if I had to choose.... based on my artistic eye (yeah right lol) I'm going with the one in the red.    Easier features to draw.... nicer looking, too. (no offense to the other.... like I said, both are pretty in their own way.)|`|SB2gbgusaa	Hmm.. Maybe. Maybe not.  My cousin and I get asked if we're sisters, and when I'm with my actual sister, people think we're not even related O.o|`|k9gp11PMaa	Yep, and the 1 in the red looks better.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	Not at all, you have different skin tones, hair types, lip shapes, and facial structures. I guess you could be half-sisters, though.    I don't remember who was wearing what, but I choose the one on the left because rightie had kind of an odd smile. She's gorgeous, but in that picture, her lips just...have a weird shape to them.|`|6XYrDROJaa	That's a big NO

elECfJ52aa	Because we like what we see|`|YW1DXceqaa	most people don't....but it's in human nature to acknowledge a new comer on a threat level|`|6HCezA6zaa	cause the girl is hot|`|dJvoOy2caa	causee..  they think u gotta nice body or ur just hot.    the funny thing is i think guys are actually shy, so when they see a hot girl, they just spend the whole time looking at her instead of getting the guts to say hi. either that or there just desperate.,|`|OluSJC1caa	Because we naturally look at women.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	cause they want something|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Genetics.|`|HFEotT1Qaa	If it's a guy like me, I'm an idiot for eyes...    I can honestly stare at a girl's eyes for 10minutes...Such a freak =D    But staring from a distance = Nice piece of @ss|`|fT15YEkFaa	the female form is impossible for us to resist (!)|`|76dfb34e84a5375f6ceb56a8f30f239faa	They are longing 2 be with you.......    Guys are so sad.....|`|evn3rNK2aa	If I see someone, and I think I know them, I am scared to start a conversation.

Personally, I could stare into someone's eyes for, like, ever before I say a word to them XD (for me that goes for guys & gurls)|`|fj6YUwBUaa	Well there are 3 basic reasons....|`|70kJJJ7uaa	I can only speak for myself... but it seems like when I see a really hot girl, its like Beavis and Butthead are taking over my brain and all they do is go " hu-hu... hehe- hehe".. for real. I feel like an idiot.|`|koQ8H19Zaa	we only stare at beautiful things or really nasty things,although i would be a gentleman to say its because your beautiful|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	Maybe they saw you at other shows and were trying to figure it out, or maybe they just wanted to stare at you because they found you attractive, or maybe you look like a wanted criminal and they were considering bringing you in for the reward money|`|93dRdE3gaa	they are pretty..or ugly...or acting dumb|`|7Ca2Iobuaa	well for some if they can do it right it makes u stop what ur doing and stare back so its kinda a way to get a girl|`|RtHBnYSmaa	I don't know. Why didn't you go up to them and ask? Sounds pretty hypocritical of you. In order for you to notice them staring at you, you had to have  at least been looking at them.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	eye candy|`|AnIgXRcJaa	Ha I'm a little tired of being with my boyfriend and weird guys looking at me. I dress up and look good for my boyfriend, not for them to oogle over me. Even if he has his arm around me and is kissing me. Those guys don't care they still stare... ewww. No respect lol|`|fzXw9EMQaa	Two words  (Boob) (Boob)    Kidding, I guess you look really good.|`|aKfeVaXkaa	Because girls are just soooo good-looking, wel some of them, and men are animals|`|OJtFNjfvaa	They just admiring beauty|`|mXFOru11aa	we are pictureing how they look naked (TRUE)|`|vq4DYBGgaa	because your beautiful

I suppose it'll never die. slash of GNR Has produced some of the best riffts i have ever heard. Although jimi hendrix is a fantastic artist. Paul weller has produced some good material also  my all time great guitarist who isn't that appreciated is Noel gallagher, Top Man awesome guitarist. Awesome Band OASIS!|`|AA11705909	I was at the IOW festival in '70, he was chewing his face off with speed rictuses convulsing his face. A good gig tho....... RIP|`|98JZcrO6aa	A Great guy and he was left handed.     Other guitarists (not as great as Jimi but are in the top10) i think are great are: Eric Clapton, Slash, Carlos Santana, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards|`|CvZ4xz1Faa	THE best guitarist ever|`|p5CqEbKbaa	I don't really care for him myself, but my 13 year old son loves his music.|`|qADpmOlDaa	Watching news - follow Kate Silverton.

But, if you do find it, let me know and give me the link! lol    Good luck! :)
rNqF4gIVaa	Sarah McLachlan is not classical music you know. She is a pop artist - so probably better off asking this question the pop forum... I wouldn't ask a question about Mozart on the country forum - would I?|`|vsy4QMHMaa	The music store that sells Sarah McLachlan music will probably be willing to hand it over for some cash.
b46fe60dc57f6372f83e0db28adf3f39aa	I like them both.  Taylor Swift is amazing and extremely talented.   I think that anything she sings would come out wonderful, even if it was a song about..ponies.  Lol. Silly me :P|`|MbofFgD0aa	second |`|N05OZAQFaa	I actually like the second album much better :)  my favourite songs are   Love Story  Forever& Always  Fifteen  Hey Stephen|`|Nf7M7qifaa	i like both albums the same.  I feel they are pretty much the same thing except the 2nd one is a little more light hearted.  Most of her songs are talking about love on both albums, so to me they are pretty equal.|`|6ZOLND41aa	I love them both.  They were great in different ways.  It may not seem like it, but they were a lot different from each other.  "Forever & Always" is my favorite all time song by her though.
1gf0BwcXaa	.....don't leave us... xD|`|4fsH2CESaa	Not London|`|1U42A309aa	Well I live in West Sussex (southern England).    I don't enjoy living in this part of England, people are rude, stuck up and snobbish.    When I vist Yorkshire and Manchester I love it, people are so friendly and cheerful, northerners are much nicer than southerners.|`|NQxluCb4aa	im in Manchester and i love it :)|`|Jd8cgFcQaa	Not wales    try the southwest|`|m4SjP99Laa	Cornwall, never far from the beach, laid back lifestyle and beautiful scenery..... The best place.|`|G8MhZ9zCaa	The Isle of Wight    Its like another country here|`|wZYs1Nz6aa	Nowhere, move to Scotland instead.|`|gblNQ9Pcaa	Nuneaton.  'Cause im here lol.    How bout we switch places so you can see.  Always wanted to live in America. I guess its a bit of a dream for me lol.|`|beJcBzWiaa	Manchester... I think.|`|2pD0ctnhaa	Yorkshire of course, we have lovely scenery, villages, coastline, city life and I know some Americans like to visit York. Biggest and best county in England|`|koQ8H19Zaa	I recommend either Bridgnorth which is a quitessential english town which is absolutly beautiful or Oxford|`|rU3pioImaa	LONDON, its so big. You can find what ever your looking for, from lively Cosmopolitan to quite English suburb and everything in between|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Devon's lovely but if you're a city type you'll get bored.  You just have to love the countryside and the sea more than urban life to like it.  It's not a good place to look for work though.|`|frA6KJwIaa	manchester so that u could watch manchester united every week!!! (if  u like soccer)|`|1PGmB4JNaa	Brighton its by the sea and only an hr away from london |`|VU4DLpnlaa	i love being in west yorkshire, i just wish i could move districts. i live in bradford and i would like to move to leeds, or Keighley. the nicest place i've been to in england is flambouogh head. my mum goes caravanning there every year and it's absolutely picture perfect.|`|lFqUMMAGaa	The Isle of Man is a great place to live cause we have The TT's and MGP bike races also the Southern 100 ~ If I were to go back to the UK I would like to live in Cornwall because it is such a lovely place also I would have to live by the sea, cause I love the sea ~|`|LgNqYUECaa	I'm currently living in Newcastle, I think here is the best place, it's great for many reasons.    London is just way overrated.|`|YcCquky4aa	i would say the north   manchester, liverpool, newcastle etc  i think this because recent studies have proved that we are more friendly   plus the counrty side is loely|`|5MeggG3Laa	im a curious american too  i heard Cumbria is really nice, i wanna move there|`|rPyXp6dsaa	I'd say the Cotswolds, in Southern England. I went there once, and it's really historical and quaint.  Also, the landscape is really lovely.|`|TMnJJgS8aa	London is a little to crowded, try Newcastle.....
645da791a07e16987148c95ba7ac99f7aa	i asked the same question 4 or 5 months ago...here's a star for you ...|`|3e9ebbe8a2e15ebeec3eb42bbac62aadaa	im not even gonna lie  you do make a good point...|`|0o8csqmuaa	Well maybe you get a petition going and figure out that great mystery your self homie. Thats what great people do, they see injustice and they go out and solve it. Personally if you're in America, your gonna have a hard time solving that one because I dont think no one cares about Yahoo being in Africa.     I think people are more concerned with you know, recession, getting jobs, inflation, you know crazy stuff like that.    Grow up.|`|70503cfcfc1323e870ead31c66f98600aa	you are so correct  but i go and find the Africa news on the internet|`|Dwyfm0Ljaa	good point there|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	Of all the injustices that have happened and are still going on in Africa, you're taking offense with the limited amount of Yahoo domains? Seriously...?    What exactly are the consequences of this dire problem? People from Nigeria have to go to a Nigerian website for news instead of nigera.yahoo.com.     Ya that ranks right up there with the genocide in Sudan, the economic crisis of Zimbabwae, or famine in Malawi.|`|kuxVB76maa	Is this a Rap & Hip Hop question?|`|OpBFc27iaa	this RHH son, RHH|`|uZQIUeyvaa	I was wondering the same thing, i mean come on they have Quebec and New Zealand|`|KHC2oE8iaa	hmm? you ever try typing up an email to yahoo about this issue?

He doesn't say:  "Dawg, Dawg.... You were good dawg"  "I really like you!" (all of the time)  "You're really cute..."    He just does his job. He can be a little harsh sometimes, but it's constructive criticism. I can't stand Kara....|`|mu5wW7Tkaa	I love Kara! She's the perfect balance between kindness and honesty. And she's an incredible singer/songwriter.

In 3 lessons you can't learn all you need to know to memorize the keyboard and all the notes.It's gonna take near 8+ lessons to get the hang of it.    Try searching online for some help. Or see if there are some retired music teachers in your area that are into teaching piano?  -My old piano teacher was a retired elementary school music teacher and she charged $20 a month for 1 week,30min lessons.    Keep trying! Not to mention once you learn the notes you have to learn different tempos,triplets,octaves,chords and all the other things that go into music.It's not just as simple as learning notes on the scale and where they are on the piano.|`|4f97d8da1c994b343e12e8fbab8d6802aa	It takes time.  Maybe if you just practice A LOT between lessons you'll move forward faster, but your hands have to develop muscle memory which only comes from a lot of repitition for it to become fast enough.  After awhile it almost becomes like an instinct, you don't have to think about it so you can go faster, but it takes a lot of time.  There is no easy shortcut.

uahXvRSmaa	Brandenburg  Concerto No. 5 by J.S. Bach has the best harpsichord part ever heard. It's seriously awesome.     I listened to the piece you mentioned.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgMirRMzx...    I think the piano part at least at the beginning of the piano section sounds a bit like Beethoven. You should check out his Piano Sonatas.    Moonlight, Waldstein, Pathetique, Appassionata, and Hammerklavier are probably the most famous, but all his 30 something sonatas are great.    Also check out piano music by Schubert, Brahms, Liszt and Chopin.     At about 1:20 of the youtube video of the piece you mentioned it goes into Waltz time. If you like that, you should check out various waltzes by Chopin. Other composers wrote waltz's for piano also, but Chopin's are probably the most famous.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Panic at the disco, harpsichords - er, huh, what?

However, it won't be published until fall 2009.    These links might help:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Teach...    http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/linerno...    http://www.artsjournal.com/aboutlastnigh...    http://www.michaelminn.net/armstrong/|`|MoKUZuQraa	Louis Armstrong was significant because he was the first true person to play what we know as jazz today. In other words he made it popular. For the first time, in centurys Louis Armstrong brought black and whites together through his music. Although the clubs were mostly filled with African Americans white people came to listen to Louis music too because they enjoyed it. Louis Armstrong also provided other African Americans with great confidence during a time of racial segregation. They saw how well Louis was doing and they saw he was beginning to get accepted so they realized...maybe the future isn't so dull after all. Armstrong believed that you should never give up on your dreams. If you wanted to do something he would encourage you to go after it no matter what anyone else believed. Becuase of Armstrong Jazz has really took its roots and evolved over the decades. However, every musician still looks back and calls Louis Armstrong the founding father of jazz.    I hope this helps and good luck with your paper.

XLxC9oK9aa	A viola is much like the violin in shape and in the way that you play it. It has a bridge, a neck, a scroll, a chin rest, 4 pegs, 4 fine tuners (depending on the instrument), a tailpiece, a sound post, 4 strings ( C,G,D, and A, in order from lowest to highest), and generally people use a shoulder rest while playing it, depending on their preference. Unlike the violin, the viola size is measured by inches. It ranges from a paltry 12 inches to a humongous 16 inches or longer.  Violists generally play in the Alto Clef, on which middle C is centered on the middle staff line. However, they occasionally have to read music in the Treble Clef. The instrument is proudly and grandly played on the left shoulder of the musician, who traps the instrument between his chin and his shoulder. In his right hand he holds a bow of either wood or fiberglass that has horsehair to draw out the sound. He must remember the rosin on his horsehair, for without it, there will be no friction between the bow and the strings, and thus the instrument will produce no sound.|`|q3b0nHLaaa	its like a violin but its lower...or higher i can never remember :P  10 points pls :D    EDIT: as long as you dont give it to those ppl who copy/pasted from wikipedia xD|`|GqEAun7Baa	xDD Haha those two obviously went on wikipedia.

It's like a violin, but bigger, and with a lower "voice."  I find it to be less cloying-sounding than a violin.  It sounds more grounded and less "whiny."|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Such bland answers!  How about some jokes!    How do you keep a violin from getting stolen?  You put it in a viola case!    What type of musicians are in a typical string quartet?  A good violinist, a bad violinist, a former violinist, and a person who hates violinists.    Joking aside, I've honestly always enjoyed the sound of the viola more than that of the violin, because good viola playing reminds me more of a singing human voice.|`|70jNDiIiaa	You've got a great selection of answers there, that's for sure. I loved Ryan's jokes - but by the same token, I feel sorry for viola players, it really is such a beautiful instrument, and sadly neglected.    But thank goodness you don't play the bassoon. Seriously - once somebody asked me what instrument I played, and when I replied, they thought I was talking about a monkey with a bright pink bottom! I still can't work out how I'd make music on such a creature...weird stuff...    Happy viola-playing!    Cheers,  Hafwen.|`|DMpVSHvXaa	There's this orchestra rehearsing, and one of the violists comes to the conductor in tears.  "What's wrong?" asks the conductor.  "One of the cellists gave one of my pegs a quarter turn," sobbed the violist.  The conductor was nonplussed.  "What's the big deal? Just change it back."  "He won't tell me which one it was!"    ------    *Rachel puts on her Seriously Serious Hat*    The viola is a member of the violin family. It has 4 strings, tuned to C, G, D and A. It sounds a perfect 5th below the violin, providing that both are in tune and that both musicians are pressing down the same string (as in, both pressing down, say the lowest string) in the same place relative to the length of each string. If the violinist is in first position using his second finger on the E string, and the violist is in 7th position using his first finger on the D string, then they will be a tritone apart.  (Thank you, Captain Obvious.)  The viola has a darker, dryer tone than that of the violin. One notable difference between the violin and viola is in the tones of their respective A strings: the viola's is more piercing, dry and poignant than that of the violin.  Because violinists go to concerts and shoot viola soloists, there is not as much repertoire for the viola as there is for the violin, as composers don't really see the point of writing for an instrument when everyone who plays it dies at their debut concert.|`|sjkfjTBdaa	The viola is a bowed string instrument. It is the middle voice of the violin family, between the violin and the cello.    The casual observer may mistake the viola for the violin because of their similarity in size, closeness in pitch range (the viola is a perfect fifth below the violin), and nearly identical playing position. However, the viola's timbre sets it apart: its rich, dark-toned sonority is more full-bodied than the violin's. The viola's mellow voice being frequently used for playing inner harmonies, it does not enjoy the wide solo repertoire or fame of the violin.|`|ic7GSkM1aa	The viola is a bowed string instrument.

The viola is a stringed instrument very similar to the violin and can be found in almost every string orchestra. Its differences to other stringed instruments is that, though it is similar to the violin it has an entirely different sound. It is slightly larger than the violin, and is sized to the individual player. It also shares the same open strings as the cello: A, D, G, and C. In most musical pieces, the viola is often the harmonic part to the melody most often in the 1st violin section.|`|MsLKIJWJaa	It is similar to the violin but bigger in size.

I went to see him in concert twice.  He's put out some really good music, but I kinda lost interest in him when I found out he likes to hit women.   Still when I need a kicking 80s tune I pull out White Wedding.

Since this is an anonymous place and since it costs NOTHING to be nice, I would say a lot of users simply do not measure up as human beings.    Back in the early days of multiuser systems, systems administrators discovered that users could expect the moon and want a pony and be very angry about it when they did not get it.  Thus the term LART arose, which was an acronym for  Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool.    Precisely what comprised that tool ranged from a billet of wood, a stun gun, a tactical nuke, etc.  The purpose was to get the Luser's attention so the required adjustment of attitude could be explained.  (see also:  Clue-by-four)    Judging by the exceptionally egregious decorum some users here practice, we still need the LART.  (sigh)      But don't worry, I have met some here who give me hope, and I strive to be one of those myself.    And there's nothing wrong with your avatar.  Mine would marry it if my avatar were of the marrying kind, and if yours asked. :D|`|8uIfskigaa	Pass no heed..just be yourself & don't let others get you down & don't change who you are... :)|`|499zMr5Maa	Dull question though.|`|AA10742567	Most people are quite ignorant, and stupid.

h1IYS0dbaa	There is no "best" or "nicest" classical music.    One of my favorite compositions are the Goldberg Variations by J. S. Bach.

Go to Google video and type in Wilhelm Kempff..  You'll find it there!    Air on the G String- J.S.Bach    This is also another amazing piece... It's just simply beautiful!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Air on a G String  Vivaldi's Four Seasons|`|HLMzKR53aa	"moonlight sonota" by beethoven|`|VD3M8izdaa	I personally prefer anything involving Beethoven or Mozart, especially if it includes a glass harmonica.     if you can find a clean version of Adagio - Mozart, where it uses a glass harmonica rather than piano or flute, that's great.|`|ShXW6zEfaa	The Canon by Pachelbel.|`|AA11900069	Vivaldis' "Four Seasons" is very accessible to the first time listener.  I also love the Bhrams Violin Concerto in Dminor.  There is Beethovens' piano sonata no.14, the "moonlight sonata" which you have probably heard elsewhere already.  Barbers' Adagio for strings is very stirring, as is Albinonis' Adagio.       On classical guitar, try the Rodriguez guitar concerto.  Beautiful!|`|kXCgQoYLaa	Any good Russians- Shostakovich, Tchiakovsky, Prokofiev,  etc. I like the ballet music of them all|`|gM03eKTJaa	Since no one's mentioned him, anything by Gerald Finzi is really pretty.

Also as someone else mentioned, Lux Aeterna by Clint mansell is amazing - http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=hKLpJtvzlE...|`|CwDcCImmaa	If you want something different why not try some modern composers such as Philip Glass    My personal favourite piece of music is his String Quartet No.5, particularly the last movement (the best part is around the 3 minute mark)    If you're into more 'traditional' classical music, I would suggest Mussorgsky's Night on the Bare Mountain, or Borodin's Polovetsian Dances from Prince Igor|`|t38kyTS6aa	song from a secret garden?

Edit: Wait, I just realized, this is probably in reference to the song by Mindless Self Indulgence, in which case, you probably won't understand the above reference anyway.

Wish I laughed more.|`|evEJxv06aa	you don't have a problem your just a happy person i am like that some times to but it doesn't mean it is a problem .|`|xYisIAT5aa	your just a happy person:)  i'm the same way|`|PKOOlYZ7aa	well my mom told me if you always laugh you like a lot of boys       no offence|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	Maybe you don't know how to control your feelings and feel that laughing will cover them up. Please remember, my son had a girlfriend that laughed at EVERYTHING!! He had pneumonia that year and she came over. When he told her that he was sick, she laughed. He dumped her. You really need to show other emotion besides humor because not everything is funny.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Nothings your problem...some people laugh...some people don't...thats as far as it goes..|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	You're an extremely happy person and you have a good life and nothing to be unhappy about.|`|MUcaYL0Paa	i kind of have the same problem. but it sucks when i laugh at an awful situation. like when someone tells me someone just died, i feel upset about it, but for some reason i want to laugh. i think its more of a nervous, awkward laugh. i guess u just need to learn to control it. think of something REALLY sad when u shouldnt be laughing.|`|hCHCRUifaa	i wouldnt worry about it at all laughing is great! you should only get worried if you laughed when someone died or something|`|NsHV4O8oaa	i've something like that - we were having this conversation and someone said something so random but it was hysterically funny - no one could speak for about 5 minutes because of sheer laughter.  but it really struck me funny and i kept it going most of the week  even today (this was about 2 years ago mind) i still had a chuckle  its good you can take bad situations well  keep it going, there's no problem as far as i can see  :)|`|f2e71f6Gaa	that happens me i once laughed at a funeral because i started thinking of a funny joke my friend had told me it was mortifying!!!|`|Nglxezz1aa	lol good when u dating a guy with bad jokes and u laugh he will feel good about him self|`|WcYRd9DLaa	i think your probably a very caring person and nervous.  so you laugh alot .  try not to get so embarrassed by people and you will get along.|`|826IxsmMaa	I have a friend like that... its so cute!

Maybe you need to take life more seriously. Or maybe you have a difficult time showing any other emotion. Which could be an indication of childhood trauma or a mental defect.    Now do not thumbs down me, psychologically this is what your reactions to life's curve balls may suggest.    Or you smoke too much wacky.|`|40f3895a1c7c36c604341a7d91d17cbbaa	everything!|`|R7gswreMaa	your just very happy like Pb and J ;D YOU LAUGHED!XD

Love songs, travel, nature, etc.  Since i dont know what its for, i will just go ahead and tell you a few artists i know who are lyricists.  Leonard Cohen - he is a bit old but well known for his poetic powers in song writing. I would suggest his song Hallelujah  http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardco...      Rufus Wainwright - he is my all time favourite song writer and has a ton of music to choose from. He does a great song called Dinner at Eight, which is all about a family dynamic, the pain families can cause each other just with a few words - it makes me cry that song. A   great album to check out is Want I or Want II.  http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rufuswain...      Last of all, Joni Mitchell. Great folk song writer and very well respected all over the world. A wonderful song is "Case of you", which is a love song and has been covered by many people.  http://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/joni+mitche...

AA11665732	I think it is a song created just for the show.  At the end of the music, a man says, in a deep voice "So you think you can dance?".  You are right, it does have an 80's feel to it, but it doesn't ring a bell for me.
be7de9d4ba67319fec1a612620ef7166aa	Yes, you're right, it is rated R for "strong and disturbing sexual content, a scene of violence, language, drug content and brief nudity".  It is 91 minutes long and so far I have heard some good things about it.  It came out in 2005 for screening at the Toronto Film Festival and I am interested to see it based on what others had to say.  It is scheduled for a wide release date of August 25th.    Here's an overview of the plot:  In Jamie Babbit's THE QUIET, (USA) cheerleader Nina Deer's (Elisha Cuthbert) seemingly idyllic life of is thrown into turmoil when Dot (Camilla Belle), a deaf teenager, is adopted into her suburban family. After first being ostracized as a "freak," Dot soon becomes extremely popular as those around her find her to be someone they can conveniently and safely confess their darkest secrets to. Struggling with a very disturbing secret of her own, Nina strikes an unlikely bond with Dot as the film explores love, sex, and moral decay. THE QUIET is a world premiere.    source: http://www.empiremovies.com/tiff2005.php...    Here's an IMDB review by Robert:  "This film receives a 10 for disturbing subject matter. It is at times very difficult to watch. The characters are troubled, each in his/her own way. It feels edgy and often very foreign. With that warning, I must say that on some level I enjoyed the film. Technically it is superb. The character development is wonderful, the story intriguing and the plot is gripping. As the plot unfolds, you are forced to change your opinions about each of the characters. At first I despised the main character but felt much sympathy for her towards the end. Not an uplifting film, but that is certainly not what the screenwriter nor the director intended. I suspect that it will be an award winner.

Belle plays an orphaned deaf and mute girl sent to live in the home of her godparents (Falco and Donovan) and their daughter (Cuthbert). Her presence unleashes the dark secrets of their suburban family and her love interest (Ashmore).     "We acquired rights to the film from Screen Gems, not unlike the relationship we had with them on 'Saving Face,"' said Sony Pictures Classics co-president Michael Barker, who's planning a limited New York and Los Angeles release August 25 followed by a platform rollout.     The film, directed by prolific TV helmer Jamie Babbit, made its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September as a work in progress, and has since been modified with a voice-over from Belle explaining her character's feelings.

hjDB62VGaa	Alan Jackson  "I Don't Even Know Your Name"    Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on highway 41  You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done  I knw you didn't see me, I was in a corner booth  Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth   So I flagged you down for coffee   But I couldn't say a thing   But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name    I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name  I've never been to good at all these sexual games  So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way  I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name    So I ordered straight tequila, a little courage in a shot  I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot  I got a little wasted, yeah I went a little far  But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car  The last thing I remember I heard myself say  I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name    I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name  I've never been to good at all these sexual games  So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way  I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name    The next thing I remember, I was hearing wedding bells  Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil  I raised the veil, she smiled at me without her left front tooth  And I said 'Where the heel am I and just who the hell are you?'  She said 'I was your waitress and our last name's now the same'  'Cause I;m married to you baby and I don't even know your name    I'm married to a waitress, I don't even know her name  I've never been to good at all these sexual games  I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way  Hey I'm married to a waitress and I don't even know her name    Comment: Finding lyrics is fairly pain free and actually fun.

We try as much as possible to fair with others.  No favoritism with friends.  We treat all our friends the same.  We all bring them to the cinemas, to the restos and to our house and my room  No one is left out.  Of course, for the special someone.  I am devoted to her but I explain to her that my friends has also a place in my heart.  But I emphasize she is always the first to be brought to the cinema that she liked, to the resto that she liked and to my house.  But my friends will have their turns afterwards.  Balancing the needs of the special someone vs. the demands of my other friends.|`|wBhj043Raa	ok so im a libra and from my expirence i like and dislike:    things to be organized i cant stand messy people.    when i see people doing things wrong i cant stand that so i just do it my way.    i dont like men who cheat on thier girl firends and treat them like crap, i like to take a girl to romantic places.    we dont really like to be anoyed much.    we always try to fix things and make them right and we work hard.    i love elegance, charm and we have good taste.    i mostly dream of living in a very nice and romantic place somewhere peacefull with tress and a landscape that goes on for miles with a waterfall or strem a nice house with a good family and something like that.    we are very loyal.    yeah so thats mostly it.    hope that help's!

E9rAV6TAaa	i don't know i have watched all the episodes and i think that episode 26  was the last episode because the professor dies but there might be new episodes because the professor's assistant is still alive and he might take over and i heard that the new episode is called 'a new mission' and it is the first episode in season 2 and it is coming out between march and april if you wanna watch any episodes go to     http://www.anime15.com/index.php/categor...|`|qOhoEZr4aa	NO Idea but I am wondering when it will start in US
ZyGyDLsDaa	Primer (2004)?  Shane Carruth wrote, directed and stars in this complex and confusing sci fi tale.  IMDb synopsis:  At night and on weekends, four men in a suburban garage have built a cottage industry of error-checking devices. But, they know that there is something more. There is some idea, some mechanism, some accidental side effect that is standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And so, through trial and error they are building the device that is missing most. However, two of these men find the device and immediately realize that it is too valuable to market. The limit of their trust in each other is strained when they are faced with the question, If you always want what you can't have, what do you want when you can have anything?  IMDb review excerpt:  Two entrepreneurs inadvertently invent a time travel device and then use it to change history again and again and again.    Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzJQEyJe...    I watch movies on IFC throughout the week, but I don't recall a title with "Carbon" in it. This is the only time travel film that comes to mind, but I'll look around some more. "Fetching Cody" is an offbeat time travel movie, but I don't know if it's aired on IFC. // I found a movie titled "The Carbon Copy" (2008), but I don't think it's science fiction.

9EAIMt0Baa	Ok here is my all time favorite. Take a toilet paper roll. Rip it to shreds. Drench the shreds in water for a while (the shreds should be small). Put the shreds in your hand and squeeze them together as hard as you can.     If you did it correctly, the brown bundle should look like a piece crap (and i mean it really looks like the real thing).  If it doesn't quite look like crap yet, then just put it in water again so the shreds come apart and try again.    Before someone goes to the bathroom, place the crap thing on the toilet seat and you will see a great reaction.    Note: I may be a guy but this prank works extra well on girls.|`|rdp95817aa	take a ketchup packet, like the ones from fast food places, and open it a little bit put below the rim of the toilet so when they sit on the toilet it will squirt out all over and will look like they had there peroid

JSn9WxgAaa	evrything was in her head...remember mildred kemp in the beginnig told her who will i share my stories with.. also rem. when anna had flashbacks and rachel was havin an afair with the dad, she imagined rachel to be so evil and horrible tht she really killed her.. she had multiple personalities and she was so in a mental state from her moms and sisters death..also kemp filled her head with all those stories most likely about the 3 children she killed and how she got those pearls.. so when rachel had those pearl mayb tht triggere annas mem.. but kemp just further messed up tht girls mind.. Also rachel was an innocent person. At the end anna said shefinished wat she started and tht was killin rachel.  Also kemp of course killed those 3 children.. so she was mixin kemps story with her own life.. she was mentally unstable

James Cameron already did a follow up film from his movie, Ghosts of the Abyss... but it's about the real passengers on the titanic, not Jack and Rose, etc...

4b7ef9733064c3bd26d60f061d593530aa	I love Criss Angel, tape every show on A&E. The definition of MINDFREAK from his show is:    MINDFREAK: \Mind*freak\   n 1: a modern day mystifier who utilizes skills beyond the category of magic  2: the result of something incomprehensible  3: supernatural  4: Criss Angel|`|AA10913801	it means gay magician|`|AA11610005	I love him. I think his personality is awsome. During the intro to the show it gives the definition of mindfreak. I tried to find it but had no luck. You have to pay attention and read very fast to catch it on the intro. He is the most awesome magician, in my opinion. Did you see the one where he went through the wood chopper? It was freaky!!!!|`|AA11511911	I enjoy the show.  Mind freak is what he is.  He can do somethings like levetate and turn water to beer, and survive falls, and gunshots.  Watching him do some tricks is truly a mindfreak.|`|AA11255587	do you know lil shanice other songs ,if u do mail me bjpumpindogg@yahoo.com|`|AA10935636	i think he is awesome i love the show|`|AA11280673	i like chris angel he is so cool!  midfreak it means modern day mystefier who uses illusion to enterntain other people sorry if my spelling is not correct|`|6063e9f4dde2ce6eb590cd5e79d292efaa	There's a reason this show is on after midnight.|`|9b23dc160510c2a03874c2e7c4ec3352aa	i like him pretty well..  not sure if it has any other meaning than the fact he messes with peoples minds with his tricks..

But I like Kenny Chesney more, so I'm glad he won!|`|ba2d632a3ae826f6a7d5385da46ed5efaa	I'm not a huge country fan but I still think they should have won. And that means a lot coming from someone who doesn't listen to country most of the time.|`|AA10696792	I think keith urban should have won, personally. He has had an awesome year. Rascal Flatts are great...on a cd. Have you HEARD them live? They sound terrible. The harmonies aren't great in person. They do a lot of work to them in the studio. Kenny Chesmey...same thing. I saw him in concert and was bored to tears. We left halfway through his set. Everytime I hear him on TV, he sounds off. There are very few entertainers that sound great live. Brooks & Dunn-awesome! Never miss a note. Keith Urban-always great! Fun shows.

He got bored with the same old easy punk so now hes not in Sum 41 anymore.      Billy Joel - He writes his own music and lyrics and was the first punk guitarist that broke the punk laws and played whatever he wanted... doesnt that kind of define punk... breaking the rules?

ca3b63e40aa9759641ed2dfd2df4ba9caa	Its quite easy to teach yourself the guitar. I suggest learning the piano, then apply your knowledge to the guitar.|`|AA11502176	everybody plays guitar. piano will set you apart a little bit more. but you can't go to the beach with your piano.|`|AA12243490	Classical Guitar. You can carry a guitar with you just about anywhere...|`|AA12340897	i heard if you play the piano....everything else would be easy! so you can learn both!|`|a24fff2045b7803354b8f9fc54af8a46aa	Piano allows you to learn all keys and all notes, then you can master trying to play the guitar|`|559d9704a139c674a14d3db7983668a8aa	In my opinion, I think it is better to learn to play the piano first. The piano enables you to get the notes of a certain piece of a song. Advantage are: 1) in case there is no one to help you tune a guitar - as long as you have a piano (or even just a keyboard), you can do it easily. 2) notes can be easily translated to guitar chords.|`|aa9bec7f0a44ba89bc22005d1054d2ffaa	piano|`|AA11446491	Better for what?    They both have pros and cons. Easier to transport a guitar than a piano though.|`|a8417a57415401f2c36ca8a00279e9b0aa	While growing up, I was always told that once you learn to play an instrument like piano, every other instrument is much easier to learn.      It may not sound right or true, but I learned how to play the piano, & I found learning the guitar was much easier.    What it comes down to, is when you learn Music Theory, you can apply it to every musical instrument, that you want to learn.

It also means you can show off everywhere.  - it's easy to setup, just need the guitar, don't need to prepare lots of things  - it's nice (i'm not saying it's nicer than piano), the way you sit with the guitar, playing it, so romantic (and easy to attract girls)  - guitar can make many kind of voices by playing it differently.
AA10640752	That is a good question. I think that video is so sexy. I wish it was me in the video because it was so mistic and exotic.

3a1781e7f865db79836a5eacd159123caa	Gas or Charcoal?  I just bought one of the cheapest gas models from Wal-Mart and the prices started at 70$ up to $500 and that includes a tank of propane.  If you want to go charcoal then it will start out considerably less.  You can a cheap, but good, charcoal grill around $30.  Of course you can spend as much as you want on these things.  You have to condsider the person using it.  If it is a single person then you will not need to go overboard, but if it is for a family then you need a larger size.  I hope this helps.|`|AA10560773	Grill prices vary, depending on what you want. You can get something like a charcol grill cheap. Then you can get a gas grill that the prices go from $50.00 on up. I myself have a state of the art grill. It is made by Vermont Castings. Price $900.00 up. But I needed one this BIG as when I have family over all of a sudden everyone is related.

WJWW7NXaaa	I believe life is fair because I believe in a just God|`|qXkTatLMaa	I do not think that life is fair.  I believe that a person has to go through trials and tribulations in order to build character and develop their sense of self.  How a person deals with stress, trouble, and different circumstances determines what kind of person they are.  If life was fair, everyone would be dealt the same hand, and there would be no diversity.  Yet, as we know, the world is full of diverse people, with a wide range of circumstances.  Therefore, life is not fair.  But what matters is how you deal with your personal set of circumstances.|`|awi1UXI4aa	No life was not meant to be fair. It was meant to live and learn. Then take what we have learned and share it with others to help them. If life was fair we would all be peachy and never learn from our mistakes in life.|`|h3MY4Mtnaa	No not all. Life is not fair. there are always downfalls, upsets. We cant always get what we want. We have heart breaks, crime, wars, people dying every second, people raped every three, violence, racisim. i can go on lol|`|87b2f8ae49f1453d1bbbef16ce9e9a81aa	fairness is a abstract term applied from a "higher" consciousness, now knowing what i know i know that it is not fair, but most of the time this isnt of much difference in my consciousness|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Absolutely.  <br>  <br>  Nobody owes me anything- I know this.  Therefore, I'm very grateful for anything I have.|`|zzivfC0qaa	Well life is like a fair you ride the ferris wheel until it always goes up and down.|`|8sZc1nPJaa	No. <br>  Life ~ trying to make the best of the unfairness.<br>  Everything happens for a reason, things just need to fall into place. and hopefully we make the right decisions along the way. Directing us to happiness.|`|NEjMcnEnaa	No because we were not born equal.|`|KSJhYH2yaa	k|`|90MSfEGSaa	yes|`|2kR4sX48aa	NO|`|0zUrSJlRaa	No, because I'm not tall.|`|26e24c1af79f4e570b548a5fd50a4426aa	no!|`|6wUojgSRaa	no, because i was not born in france!!|`|6dWlnf20aa	It is what you make it.|`|Pxmhr8ynaa	No. If life was fair, Hitler would have gone to art school and the Holocaust never would have happened. If life was fair, a 50 year old woman wouldn't be going under the knife to perk up her boobs while small children in Africa either starve, die of AIDS, or get forcefully recruited by guerilla armies. If life was fair, there would be no such thing as a third world or developing country.<br>  <br>  We have to face it, life isn't fair. It can be very kind, but to some it is dreadful beyond words. I don't want to come off as a cynic or a pessimist, but it's true. Life is not fair, no matter how good you have it, because someone else out there who desperately needs help isn't getting it. Thankfully charities are being set up to help correct this. Donate or help out somewhere soon!|`|iTKhQKdBaa	no i don't because it just isn't. some people may say that it is fair because of karma but really, karma isn't always fair and it may catch up to you but that may be one of the greatest times in your life where you can fix it so easily its nothing more then a slap on the wrist.<br>  <br>  i don't think its fair because there are people out on the streets and it isn't their fault that they're there and they can't do anything about it. like me i'm lucky. in school i don't try and i don't care but i get the A's i need and right now my gpa is over 3.5. i don't think it's fair because there are people who actually try harder then me and they're lower then me but i really can't do anythign about it.<br>  <br>  some parents are nicer to bad kids and some can be an angel but their parents won't trust them.<br>  <br>  a lot of things aren't fair in life but that's life.|`|fiScqQD5aa	no.cause you cant live earning minimum wage. i get 400 every 2 weeks at work working part time.a total of $800 a month. i make minimum wage and i cant afford a place to live. i cant even afford a car i have to ride the bus to work. and i cant afford cellphone either. i can only afford renting a garage for $500 month and having $300 for food and clothes and any other needs in a month. lifes not fair for me|`|xKF75pMaaa	no because well were not born equally if you think people are then your living in a fantasy world look at the kids in africa my grandparents sit in there condos disscussing heaters when people dont have heat they dont have heat because they were most likely born that way either not being able to succeed or they were just born poor and didnt have a choice i dont see how life could be fair the ceos at those auto comp. are making millions and millions of dollars a year when people who bust the as-ses get hardly 20 thousand i could go on and on about this really life is has never been and will never be fair deal with it.<br>  <br>  relaz aout your answers people live to give stupid answers on this esspecially in polls and surveys|`|gkWVfKsdaa	no, not everyone can control what happens to them and for the ppl that are born in the middle of a war or starve for their whole life... then no, it's not fair for them. many ppl have better lives and are more fortunate than others and they should be grateful|`|XVh1uf4Taa	No life is not fair....small children out there with cancer, or who are killed by their own parents....and never have a chance<br>  But I like to think those precious children go straight to heaven where they forget all about this place :D<br>  <br>  I sound so negative lol, I'm really not! :D  Good question!|`|KJp1AHA2aa	Even in my happiest moments, it's not fair.<br>  Everything around you, just doesn't work..<br>  Even if you're the nicest person around. It just doesn't come back at you.|`|rJu4X6MDaa	no, my cousin the sweetest little kid in the world. has leukemia, my mother who has always been kind and polite has a case of diabetes so severe she can't hold a job. <br>  <br>  no, life is not fair|`|uwLrHLHjaa	Life is unfair because of a lot of things. I could write you a whole essay on why life isn't fair but i'll save you the heavy reading.|`|7juyt0Beaa	No. How can it possibly be fair with amount of people living together? Somebody is going to have more advantages than another, genetically and situationally.|`|1xzuormXaa	not at all, i have everything i could ever ask for and i really love my life but i dont think im a very good person, im sure there are people out there that deserve all this more than me|`|YfHZz963aa	nope ....becuz good things are given to people who don't deserve it.... while bad things happen to good people.<br>  some people have the advantage of getting ahead in life because their pretty..and somethimes life just kicks you right in the a@@ during hardships.|`|xQKhzvEaaa	It's fair when we're happy.  It's not fair when we're sad.|`|OyRX3OxLaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  We all have problems and something to whine about. Since it's everybody, that seems fair to me.|`|WcTx6z7Caa	no.<br>  because bad things happen to people that dont deserve it<br>  life is not horrible<br>  things just dont go the way we sometimes want them to|`|JrjIxByqaa	Not all of the time.  Sometimes you make mistakes that make it seem as if life is not fair.|`|5BbxCohFaa	no...because obama is president...were all doomed...|`|pdIALbj1aa	noo cause i have a small dick awww|`|qlpjDvoNaa	yes, have we really been good enough to deserve anything.|`|sOAY4Wgnaa	absolutely<br>  <br>  what would you rather have lifeless lived?|`|S1s8NsWwaa	Nope|`|jABKYT71aa	HELL NO!!!!!|`|KM6PDz5qaa	No life is never fair..Life is about the choice you make.|`|iZt5jqbpaa	yes.|`|RAAlHwKPaa	Fire - Arthur Brown|`|PtZeqxFjaa	No...bad things happen to good people|`|hWtZiUPHaa	No because I was born in the states|`|j3yHRDNkaa	AT TIMES IT CAN B AND OTHERS NOT TO MUCH|`|Rk6wqpeAaa	no, and it never intends to be|`|XyhK9dr5aa	no because if it was we would be communist.|`|tmwOwc0Laa	Life is a b*tch but i think i fell in love with it|`|0lnamekJaa	Life is 100% fair... We ALL die... <br>  <br>  What you do BEFORE that is up to you... Saying "Life Isn't Fair" just means that you refuse to take responsibility for your own actions and/or inaction's...<br>  <br>  "Fair" is a fairy tale to keep kids from realizing that death is the ONLY thing that equalizes us all...|`|ns1F0p8Laa	Life can be unfair at times but life is really what you make it.  If you choose to live a difficult life then that's what you'll get in return.|`|Qagl7o1Haa	No, If It was, everything would be much Simpler then trying my hardest To change myself and every problem around me, so I can at least wake up to a more better day, and more Motivated.<br>  <br>  But Life is how you make it, so its Better off To be thankful for what you have, then wishing it was 100,000% better. <br>  <br>  =)|`|BBVfRheyaa	Unfair.|`|DqUXn5wFaa	no. Idk how to explain it. I love ur avatar,though! Rock on!|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	No, life is not fair.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some are born rich, some poor, some into sickness and some not. Some born with disablities and others completely healthy.<br>  <br>  Even as we mature, we cannot all take the same path and be successful. Only in death are we all equals.|`|AA11518036	No l don't.<br>  Life just happens unexpectedly.|`|jiOohUa0aa	Sometimes life is fair, sometimes it's partly cloudy.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well no cause their are so many things happening and they will get worse.|`|q7ZMQeCMaa	NOPE|`|4sW8MFxCaa	no|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	no<br>  it never was and never will be|`|VWvI5RyBaa	No, because I'm happy and most of the people I meet aren't.

A work friend took me to the doctor's to get a prescription to improve my mood. That was embarrassing also. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't lie too much about the crying because you will send a message that you are not a trustworthy person.

ax9xk0Ndaa	(Love these questions 1st time i got a chance to answer lol)<br>  <br>  Well being a Capricorn i really like everything to be neat, organised & perfect.. But for some reason i'm really messy.. It's not that it's on purpose or anything but i just pile up things then don't get round to putting them away.. And it's even more frustrating when i get criticized about it cos i take it personally then get more stressed out and take longer about putting away (if i'm being honest).. I can do work with my room like that though.. But being the hardworking Capricorn i'm supposed to be i'm not really that hardworking..i used to be..but i always start things then don't get round to finishing them.. But i like knowing i have lots of things to do.. I think i'm going off subject now..<br>  <br>  But yeah i'm messy and only when i get time and i'm feeling in a really good mood and i'm playing some nice loud music - i would find the time to put everything away then properly clean it all out properly.. ..but eventually it ends up happening again..especially when i'm stressed out or in a mood which happens quite often with a Cancer Moon.. It's quite frustrating really cos i know i don't like it messy - but at the same time i don't really care that much - but i do..(Capricorn vs. Gemini? I don't know..not saying Gems are untidy..I'm a Capricorn and look at me)<br>  <br>  (even more annoying that i get attracted to Virgos quite abit lol..)|`|781230deacf60344d474c72bd360783faa	In my messy room, I can still function and focus on my coursework or any other thing I need to get done. ill do it but i reallly gate cleaning. normally my place is a mess. im an aries|`|AkSOZ099aa	Clean Freak! <br>  Scorpio!|`|wmNXRnPnaa	I'm not going to lie, I'm an aries and I am seriously sloppy. I can't keep anything neat ^_^|`|4VNFsmanaa	It depends on my mood. Sometimes I get into these really weird cleaning moods, where I just want to clean and organize the entire house. Other times, I couldn't care less. I usually keep my room fairly clean, but if I get told to clean it by my parents, I just want to make it even worse (I have authority issues, lol). I also want to completely change the layout of my room at least once every couple of months. I actually think I wouldn't mind cleaning up after myself, but I don't want to be forced to, or clean up after a lot of people.<br>  <br>  I'm a Gemini Sun, Taurus Moon, Aquarius Rising<br>  = )|`|bdfk2d49aa	I may appear like a neat freak but my apartment says otherwise. I value grooming so I iron my clothes and make sure that they go well together plus I shine my shoes. It takes me more than an hour to finish grooming and that includes time to shave, fix my hair, oral hygiene and put on contacts. But that's just my appearance.<br>  <br>  My apartment must look like a mess right now. I bet my cereal bowl is still on the table while the bed is surely unfixed. Heh. I was actually compared to a snake because I kept leaving my clothes where I took them off much like how a snake leaves its skin where it sheds it. Though the mess can be dealt with in between commercial breaks whenever I watch basketball games.<br>  <br>  Pisces Sun. Virgo Moon. Taurus Rising.<br>  <br>  I guess the tidy appearance is due to the Moon and Rising while the messy environment could be blamed on the Sun... and a busy schedule, lack of inclination, procrastination...|`|mD7eAAoNaa	I am pretty neat and organized, but normally not a freak about it. Sometimes I go on a cleaning streak and during that time I will get so frustrated with the mess and clutter. I hate when things are on the floor, especially clothes and I end up stepping on them. Once I step on them, it's like I busted a fuse or something. My room does get messy from time to time, like papers on the desk, etc. I like my things to be in the same place all the time, if I pick something up to use it, I make sure to put it back in it's original spot. I also like to be clean hygiene wise. I like the bathroom, the sink, mirrors, kitchen, counter, door knobs clean and sanitary. <br>  <br>  I have Scorpio Rising and most of my friends think I'm neat and organized. More organized than neat. Most Scorpio's I know are pretty messy. Since, Scorpios come off as intense people, maybe my home will appear intensely clean to others. <br>  <br>  Virgo Sun (that explains everything) <br>  Cancer Moon<br>  Scorpio Rising<br>  <br>  =D|`|uel6NBOVaa	Hahaha...It depends. Actually, I like things to be clean. I can't stand my room to be messy....yet....at the same time I'm very lazy when it comes to cleaning. It will start out all organized and nice, and little by little the stuff piles up and eventually I just don't have "time" to clean it. I do feel a little bit unbalanced and uncomfortable when it gets that way, though, but I still find a way to function. If anything, I'm an extremist in both directions. If it's already messy then I just stop caring and make it worse. If I get off my lazy a** and decide to clean it, then I have to make it absolutely perfect or that one slip of paper that you mentioned will drive me up the wall. I will never let people see my messy room though...If I think anybody's going to come over I usually shove everything in the closet and under the bed and make it look seemingly perfect, lol. <br>  <br>  Libra Sun/Cancer Moon/Libra Rising|`|PCAlAoDsaa	My room is messy. It is full of junk every where including the closet. I am beginning not to find some stuff where I put it. I am going to start my spring cleaning early and get rid of stuff.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	neat freak - never, but I have been called a "control freak."  Untidy, yes, but never unclean.<br>  <br>  Sag sun / Libra moon / Cancer rising|`|S2uAq7i4aa	I'm a neat freak! :D<br>  <br>  Leo/Sag/Aqua/Libra|`|2DAfAjv2aa	I guess you could say I'm more neat than untidy. Looking around my desk, all the books and papers are stacked up, and everything's pretty much in it's place. My room stays decently clean except for an occasional piece of clothing that gets put away quickly. It's kind of irritating to have stuff around, and I just think it's generally easier to have everything where it belongs. I don't enjoy cleaning, I just really love the result of it. <br>  <br>  Yeah, I do think that the rising sign affects how much you value neatness. Somebody with a very socially aware outlook on the world (rising sign) would probably do their best to appear organized and well put together.<br>  <br>  Sagittarius Rising<br>  Virgo Sun<br>  Sagittarius Moon

I hear it all the time at my school and even with my own family. It annoyed the hell out of me because i have been waiting a while for the movie to come out to see how good it was and i went to the 12 o' clock showing and the people in the theater literally were so loud that i could barely hear some of the lines. At random moments people would scream out "I love you Edward" in the middle of the movie. It is quite disapointing to see all of this. Girls at my school even went to go see it just because they didn't want to read the book.  Anyway it's really sad that people are this way but i guess the best thing to do is try and ignore it.

The writer's strike last year didn't help because it never gave the show a chance to develop an audience.|`|YrFyeUJ7aa	im not sure if this is correct but i heard that moonlight was not very popular and was not making money or something. i love that show and there are rumors its starting up again, but i wouldnt get my hopes up. that would be soo cool to have a movie made to close up the series!!

Did we miss a joke to do with yo momma that maybe you have? Submit it to us and we'll add it to our popular yo momma related jokes category!     Yo momma so poor...    Her face is on the front of a food stamp.    That your family ate Cornflakes with a fork to save milk.    When I visited her trailer, 2 cockroaches tripped me and a Rat tried to steal me wallet.    She waves an ice lolly around and calls it Air conditioning.    Burglars break into yo momma's home and leave money.    When I told her about the last supper she thought the food stamps had run out.    The building society repossessed her cardboard box.    She watches television on an Etch-A-Sketch.    Each night she goes to KFC to lick other folk's fingers    She can't even afford to go to the free clinic.    When I saw her kickin a can down the road I asked yo momma what she was doing....'Moving' she replied.    I caught her trying to use food stamps in the Gobstopper machine.    When I rang her doorbell, SHE said 'Ding-Dong'    I asked her where the 'facilities were' and she replied - "Pick a corner...ANY corner..."    I visited yo momma's house, tore down the cob webs and she screamed - "Who's tearing down the drapes!!!!"    I walked into her home, asked if I could use her toilet, and she said "Sure thing, it's 4th tree on your right..."    Only time she smelled Hot Food was when a rich bloke farted...    When I saw her wobbling down the street with 1 shoe, I hollered - "Lost a shoe?", and she said - "Nope...just found one..."    She hangs the Toilet paper out to dry.    Closest thing to a car she owns is a low-riding Shopping trolley....with a box on it...    She had to take out a second mortgage on her cardboard box.    Even Beggars give you money.    She bounces food stamps.    She can't even afford to pay attention.    She uses cardboard and ribena as bread and wine substitutes.    She uses chewing gum as a band aid.    She lives in a 2-story Cracker Jack box.    She uses white-out as a tooth filler.    She can't afford a mop - she stands on her head in order to mop the floor...    Her idea of Desert was to go outside and collect the 'yellow snow'...and yo loved it, didn't ya!|`|ca6a7a3799f631a6029d399a7e037fefaa	Yo mama is so fat, you have to take a train and two buses just to get on her good side!!|`|2414474c828761d32e35ca6d7af6da76aa	yo mamma is so wonderful, she gave birth to you.|`|5d63bfc8f5afd8c5644e7dc342bf6abeaa	Yo mama is so dumb, when i said let's do it doggy-style....she laid down in the driveway and started licking herself!|`|4fbabcbf08e17332f65b81d5ac54f806aa	Yo mama so fat it don't even look like she got legs,It looks like she just be gliding across the floor!

I always thought that Sex and the City was a stupid show and she's incredibly over rated. She's not pretty, she's basically the same character in every film she does. She looks like a horse to me :)|`|HjVjSI6uaa	she was good in Sex and the City but i cant see her playing anything else<br>  and her voice is so annoying<br>  and she looks like a horse<br>  i think she has already passed her prime and we hopefully wont see too much of her now that the tv show has ended|`|AA11033942	I agree with you, she is massively over-rated!!<br>  And so was that series she starred in.<br>  <br>  She's like Kate Moss (a British model) insomuch as she's something of a fashion clothes horse... and in her case, probably off the back of that series on television. Just a plain Jane, not really pretty at all and the fact that she happens to be in the hollywood machine...<br>  <br>  There are other actresses of a similar age that are far nicer looking that she will ever be! Some people get better with age. (for example, Rene Russo, Julia Roberts) and some younger actresses in their early to mid 30s (Jennifer Garner) <br>  <br>  <br>  When she was younger, was a lot nicer looking. After the looks question, she's not even all that great at acting, after all, what's she starred in that's been any good?|`|EkaX4GdAaa	Oh hell yeah, she is sooooo fugly.

I've been a fan since she was on Square Pegs.|`|l3jwSzWeaa	nah<br>  just old|`|Pb4Xpbugaa	lmfaooo i know right? she is definitely unattractive, it's only the way she acts that makes some people think she is so glamarous, as for her looks..she sort of looks like a foot. Sorry...|`|kDPZ319haa	Hell Yes she's overrated.|`|dDxGrVZhaa	yeah she is so overrated!|`|sN66DFJ9aa	I think she looks a little bit like a dinosaur...good in Sex and the City though.|`|qcNR5MX2aa	yeaa i guess so<br>  i dont think she is gorgeous|`|sLEwXtbgaa	she has and is overated from day one.
3ddf1a4e1d8899bcf4447cad5cec852eaa	Yes, everyone has a different voice.      Practicing every day is a good thing.  But does your voice ever "give out" or get hoarse if you have sung too much or yelled too loud?    Voice teachers can help you learn good technique that can save your voice in the long run.  They can also teach you how to produce a more controlled sound, so that you are choosing how to produce your notes.  Opera, church, rock and pop all require very different types of notes in most cases.  Plus there's vibrato, tone, color, etc.    So, if you are planning to make music a career, at least consult with a voice coach for a few lessons.  In this way you will probably be able to keep your voice longer than if you hadn't.  At least you will be more in control of it.|`|AA11414797	yea thats mostly how it is. Im only mediocre when I actually sing, but I can do the metal rowr/growl singing good enough to do it in a band.|`|2f2d0585d2f3afc2c4a0776afc1388d2aa	Yeah some peopel can just sing.  Some [people can be taught how to breathe right while they are singing.  Some people just plains uck and their voice isnt a singing voice.      However What may suck for singing church songs and boy bands coudl make a good punk voice.  But I dont think you could teach someone who is horrible how to carry a pitch and make it sound good.|`|895d6e9b142426716f8eff82d4b41e97aa	yes everyone has a different voice when it comes to singing, some have it naturally and well some of us just have to practice and work at it, its best to pick out songs that best fit your voice, and if you see something new that you like well  try it out and keep on practicing, not everyone need a voice coach. but they can teach you on how to save your voice. i never had one but i do practice alot on songs that i wanna sing, im into christian rock,gospel,and country so i do a lot of different stuff i may not be the best at verything i do but at least i try. practice practice practice. i have gotten better over the years, now im tryin to write my own music and have a plan on starting a band

AA10696192	The gluteus maximus muscle (butt cheek)  is the biggest in the human body, that's why. Especially if you have slender upper arms, it will hurt more there.|`|AA11025807	I guess they just like to stick it to you.|`|AA11619161	they probably just want to see yours, If I were giving the shot hmmm|`|AA11380705	less pain, faster results, and many people fear the needle thus by not being able to see it, they're less likely to have an episode, so to speak.|`|AA12088145	Maybe they just don't want to look you in the eyes when they perform their nasty deed? Maybe watching so much alarm and panic on people's faces takes its toll on them.....so they wait until you are not looking and then jab it in your keister? I should ask them the next time i'm in need of their tender services.|`|AA11076517	some people freak out when they see a needle, plus since the butt is basically a big blob o' fat (ok, two blobs) there aren't a lot of nerves back there.    and, yeah, doctors are sadistic.  why do you think they keep the stethoscope in a freezer!?|`|AA10326029	lil_witch & norsktjej1964 are correct.|`|8bc6be41c0ff86dcfb7eccbd8120d0cfaa	So they can look at your anus.|`|AA11048070	i could explain in clinical terms,  subqutanious fat layers and safety or could just kiss it and make it better next time...|`|57903af73d5702e194d01c77d247a53eaa	Well, they give it to me in the arm but, that is because I'm not a girl that they can look at.|`|37ccea917e4cdc95f635becbdcfbe103aa	Normally it is because the solution needs to be what is known as subqutanious, which is under the skin and fat. With the rear being such a large mass of fat, it is simply easier and a safer target.|`|AA11180546	I always get mine in bum lolz..i just think its cause it hurts less thereI dont know why though but yeah  the doctors do insist on the butt more then the arm.:)...but i think its better that way though getting a needle in the arm really hurts..|`|421dcce2d04218899e188207a7cfb2adaa	Shots with a long needle are called "intramuscular" (IM) and our rumps have great muscles to shoot the meds into.  The shorter needles (like for diabetics) is call "subcutaneous" (sub-q) and injects just below the skin.  So, it depends on the shot, your muscle structure and probably other criteria assessed by medical professionals.

I'm not trying to be sarcastic, seriously; but why do you fixate on things that depress and make you angry. You need to laugh more.

L'esistenza di regole e convenzioni sociali nell'anarchia non  esclusa a priori a patto che le regole e le convenzioni vengano liberamente determinate e accettate dalla comunit interessata e non rappresentino un'imposizione derivante dal maggiore potere di alcuni rispetto agli altri.       Simbolo dell'anarchiaSebbene nella storia dell'uomo siano esistite numerose realizzazioni di societ e organizzazioni basate su principi anarchici, la Comune di Parigi del 1871  stato forse il primo tentativo di societ anarchica a guadagnarsi risonanza globale; si ricorda il commento di Michail Bakunin, uno dei grandi pensatori storici dell'anarchia. Altre realizzazioni concrete e vaste dei principi anarchici nella societ si ritrovano durante la guerra civile in Spagna, durante la quale i lavoratori, spesso attraverso le organizzazioni anarcosindacaliste come la CNT in Catalogna e Aragona, hanno dato prova di autogestione dei trasporti pubblici e delle aziende produttive sia industriali che agricole: attraverso le assemblee di base furono realizzate collettivizzazioni delle terre confiscate ai latifondisti e, in alcuni casi, fu addirittura abolita la propriet privata; questo capitolo si chiuse a causa di una sconfitta militare, infatti oltre a combattere i nazionalisti di Francisco Franco (appoggiato dall'Italia Fascista e dalla Germania Nazista), gli anarchici dovettero guardarsi anche dagli stalinisti, a cui Stalin vietava di dare armi agli anarchici. Fu per molto importante anche l'esperienza della Makhnovicina, cio l'Ucraina insorta sotto la guida del generale contadino Nestor Ivanovich Makhno e la resistenza della citt russa di Kronstadt. Entrambe queste esperienze vennero cancellate dalla normalizzazione sovietica attraverso l'utilizzo dell'Armata Rossa comandata dal generale Lev Trockij.    Il termine anarchia viene anche impropriamente utilizzato per sottolineare caos e confusione, mentre il pensiero anarchico gode di numerosi estimatori, come Noam Chomsky, noto esponente del MIT.    Il principio fondamentale che sta alla base del pensiero anarchico si fonda su un ideale di libert estrema che precluda qualsiasi forma di governo ("Tutti i partiti senza eccezione, nella misura in cui si propongono la conquista del potere, sono variet dell'assolutismo", "Il governo sull'uomo da parte dell'uomo  la schiavit", "Chiunque mi metta le mani addosso per governarmi  un usurpatore e un tiranno: io lo proclamo mio nemico" - Pierre-Joseph Proudhon)|`|109d87b513c38e34259ac5b9c8c8d4ceaa	sinistra...|`|9f5caf723550060cd2ea743ee7227c64aa	io faccio tutto a sinistra..........|`|95202a23cfbf9f8f586f852f9c91804daa	direi ancora a sinistra....anche se molto, molto, molto deluso dal governo...  sar perch tutto il resto lo faccio con la destra...mah    ciao!|`|164ef5c751397a8cc0883633d0dd813faa	Calcio con il sinistro, scrivo con la sinistra, sulla strada guido a sinistra e.... voto a destra!|`|08d38d0da522bc389056c420a210ad59aa	skrivo cn la destra....zona preferita (a pallavolo): 4  cio a sinistra....tengo il mouse cn la destra....orologio sinistra...via...dicimo ttt e due!!!!

b663f62d3c31eb2766581df3ac056453aa	There is a lot of speculation that the 7th book should be released on 7 July, 2007.    At least, it should be. While this date has no doubt already crossed the minds of many fans, JK Rowling's recent revelation that "2006 will be the year" she writes the final book lends itself entirely to this theory.    That, and it is the biggest stroke of magical marketing luck so far this century. The book simply can't not be released on 07/07/07. It's too perfect.    It just so happens that July 7, 2007 is a Saturday. It just so happens that every Potter book since Goblet of Fire has been released on a Saturday (presumably to allow kids and their parents to attend those midnight release parties without undue hardship). It just so happens that July 7 falls right in the traditional June-July release window during which the other books were released. (Finally, while less relevant but still interesting, 12:00 a.m. on Saturday will be 7 p.m. Friday in the U.S., where the most Potter books have been sold to date. Fans on the east coast, already lined up to buy their copies, will see book 7 released across the pond at 7 p.m. local time - what a coincidence.)    Rowling has hinted at the significance of the number 7, most recently in August when her official site's Wizard of the Month was an arithmancer who discovered the number's magical properties. In Half-Blood Prince, it was revealed that Lord Voldemort had made seven horcruxes (himself included). Quidditch teams have seven players each. Gryffindor Tower's entrance is on the seventh floor at Hogwarts. The list goes on and on.|`|AA11200298	January 19, 2999.|`|117c3d61be51a5929f2a999109d4df94aa	A date hasn't been given for the release of this book.

Non si capisce mai bene il personaggio e ogni tanto lo si vorrebbe prendere a sberle, ma anche per questo  bello ;)    Fatto bene, comprende vari elementi pi o meno drammatici al suo interno, ma sempre trattati con un certo gustoed essendo coerente sempre e comunque con il personaggio.

AA11883130	you are SOOOOO LUCKY!!!  now i'm jeleous!  well, as you can see, i've never been to one but the thing to remember is not to get to excited and make them think your a weirdo even though they might get that a lot. Just hold your excitment in, take their autograph and their pic. and say thanx. also, be sure you eat before you get there cause if you get hungry, you can't go anywhere. and dress simple|`|6abf9b00d94cc531c1118c2f7f9d839caa	first of all, you cant guaruntee (i cant spell that word) that you will get their autograph, or even see them.  you would need to be in the front, and somehow get their attention.  make some cute sign or something.  take a poster and a camera.|`|2b080a5680e8013c8e803903c1dbd6dcaa	I've been to one premiere, back in 1987. "End of the Line", a comedy about railroad workers trying to save their company, held its world premiere at the Breckenridge Film Festival in Breckenridge, CO. I paid $20 and got to meet Mary Steenbergen, Levon Helm (of The Band) and Kevin Bacon, who also came.   They were all very generous with their time, took a lot of pictures.    Most premieres are big affairs, especially for a film like Pirates. I'm guessing there won't be any chance to get any autographs, unless you are invited to the after party. I don't know if you are just showing up in the crowd (expect tens of thousands of screaming fans!)    Even there some stars are bad about giving out autographs (Depp is very well known for that) - so good luck. Best advice - try to get in position to take a picture of them (get a camera with a zoom!)|`|AA11200298	Just be cool, girl.

Invitations are for *******    Bridesmaids are desperate Console them.    You're a distant relative of a dead cousin.    Every female guest deserves a wedding night    Toast in the native language if you know the language and have practiced the toast. Don't wing it    Definitely be sure she is eighteen.    There is nothing wrong with having seconds if there are enought women to go around.    You understand she heard that but hat is not what you meant.      Make sure there is an open bar.    breakfast is for closers.    Your favorite movie is The English Patient.    the way to a woman's bed is through the dance floor.    Never hit on the bride.

Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top,  Ain't no telephone bills.    Once I had a girl on Rocky Top,  Half bear the other half cat;  Wild as a mink as sweet as soda pop,  I still dream about that.    CHORUS    Rocky Top, you'll always be,  Home sweet home to me.  Good ole Rocky Top,  Rocky Top Tennessee.    Once two strangers climbed ole Rocky Top,  Lookin' for a moonshine still.  Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top,  Reckon they never will.  Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top,  Dirt's too rocky by far.  That's why all the folks on Rocky Top,  get their corn from a jar.    CHORUS    I've had years of cramped up city life;  Trapped like a duck in a pen.  All I know is it's a pity life,  Can't be simple again.    CHORUS|`|581c80bea0b4a78c2a57c8e9d41b2cf0aa	I thought that was an ice cream flavor...|`|77bd798be57f2d922d4428bbfcd62362aa	now i do . .|`|AA11618585	Yeah, I like that song.|`|90f1cba6c62545dd4172256767c3536faa	Actually no, but I do have music for it : )

This was sort of unsettling whenever the only other person in the room was Alfred the butler.  I assume women are attracted to the obvious bulge in batman's costume  and are always waiting for the next close-up.

AA11766295	Artist/Band: Ball David  Lyrics for Song: Riding With Private Malone  Lyrics for Album: Amigo  I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds  When an ad that said:"Old Chevy" somehow caught my eye  The lady didn't know the year,or even if it ran  But I had that thousand dollars in my hand    It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn  Thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp  When I pulled the cover off,it took away my breath  What she called a Chevy was a sixty six Corvette    I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills  But what a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel  I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note  The date was nineteen-sixty six and this is what it wrote:    He said,"My name is Private Andrew Malone"  "If you're reading this,then I didn't make it home"  "But for every dream that shattered,another one comes true"  "This car was once a dream of mine,now it belongs to you"  "And though you may take her and make her your own"  "You'll always be riding with Private Malone"    Well it didn't take me long at all,I had her running good  I love to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood  I had her shining lika a diamond and I'd put the rag top down  All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town    The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right  But it picked up that oldie show,especially late at night  I'd get the feeling sometimes,if I turned real quick I'd see  A soldier riding shotgun in the seat right next to me    It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone  Who fought for his country and never made it home  But for every dream that's shattered,another one comes true  This car was once a dream of his,back when it was new  He told me to take her and make her my own  And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone    One night it was raining hard,I took the curve too fast  I still dont remember much about that fiery crash  Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out  They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt    It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone  Who fought for his country and never made it home  But for every dream that's shattered,another one comes true  This car was once a dream of his,back when it was new  I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along  That night I was riding with Private Malone  Oh,thank God,I was riding with Private Malone|`|2f2d0585d2f3afc2c4a0776afc1388d2aa	riding with private malone    DAVID BALL|`|e12c2f8eb4a9f1a135839b49f08a088faa	Riding with Private Malone by David Ball?  The man in the song goes to a lady to buy what she says is a Chevy but it is actually a Corvette and he finds a note written by Private Malone in the glovebox. The man says when he turns real quick, that he thinks he can see Private Malone sitting in the seat next to him. And one day he takes the turn fast, and Private Malone saves him. I hope this is the song you are talking about! If not, good luck!|`|AA12097242	Riding with Private Malone is the song title. I dont know who sings it.

Pero si RBD fue una copia de algo de otro pais, guacala! si aqui fue una porqueria ya me imagino con el habladito del pais original... Y por otra parte, Bety La Fea estuvo chistosona en la version original Colombiana y si aqui hicieron la copia, fue porque es un exito la historia, deberian sentirse halagados que una historia como esa, salga a la luz en otros paises, sobre todo en Mexico, que se dice que es un gran "trampolin" de estrellas sudamericanas para lanzarlas a la fama por las "grandes producciones" de telenovelas: hasta quieren hacer la version gringa de la tal bety la fea! sientanse halagados y no copiados caray, ni que fuera la gran cosa una telenovela... Ademas, de donde aprendio a hacer novelas por ejemplo un canal como Telemundo? De Televisa, por supuesto, igualmente TV Azteca, porque Mexico es un pionero de las telenovelas... primero investiguen un poco para que demos todos mejores respuestas.|`|9f9d70ce77e508787a017d5abb1e9247aa	hola,  Pense lo mismo cuando inici la novela, pero cuando la miro, porque por mi horario de trabajo no puedo seguirla, me parece que los mexicanos ciertamente copiaron una idea pero le pusieron mucho sabor mexicano al asunto.    Asi que les puedo decir que cada una tiene lo suyo, las novelas siempre tocan el tema de la mentira, la infidelidad, enga?o, pleitos, mujeres abandonadas y asi sigue...     RBD me parece una novela que en lugar de divertir con sus tonteras fomenta el irrespeto a los padres, a los personajes de con algun tipo de autoridad, es una novela con muchas ense?anzas negativas, los adolescentes no necesitan eso, cuando pasan por etapas de trasicin y formacin de indetidad.    Ejemplo de una novela con gran exito, es Floricienta, aunque puedas verla tonta, tiene mensajes lindos para el pblico al que se dirije... manejar los medios con cuidado, pues es una herramienta para la formacin...

Anyway, Japanese music is just as diverse as American music (in fact, the Japanese recording industry is second only to the U.S. in size), so you'll find a wide range of tastes.   Myself, I lean towards the pop/urban side of things with a dash of rock, but am not fond of the vapid girly-pop of the "Hello Project" girl groups, nor the "visual kei" rock with guys who look like girls.  I'm a big fan of Hikaru Utada, BoA (who's Korean but has carved herself out a career in Japanese pop), Namie Amuro, the brilliant green/Tommy February6/Tommy Heavenly6, m-flo, Shiina Ringo/Tokyo Jihen, Bonnie Pink, fra-foa, Puffy, HALCALI, Heartsdales, and Dragon Ash.|`|7e34c9da95e7899b9d0bfc2c0ae70553aa	Gackt, L'arc and Ciel, & Mitsuru Matsuoka!!!!!

They kidnap celebrities and steal their cars, then drive the cars hundreds of miles away while they force feed the celebrities alcohol. Then they let the celebrities go and make them drive home drunk.          Just kidding - Mel Gibson is a real douche for driving under the influence.

AA12329678	That's a close one. However, I would have to go with Sabbath. Heavy chords, depressing lyrics, plodding bass lines... the epitome of "Heavy Metal".    But Priest had some pretty heavy stuff back in the day, too. (Before they went to a more commercial sound in the '80's.) The Priest albums of the '70's: "Sad Wings Of Destiny", "Sin After Sin", "Stained Class" and "Hell Bent For Leather" contains some of rocks heaviest songs. It's just a different style of metal than Sabbath.    By the way, BIFFERD.... Zakk Wylde was in Ozzy's band. He was never in Black Sabbath. Tony Iommi is the only guitarist Sabbath has ever had.|`|AA11112155	you're kidding, right? Of course it's sabbath|`|2f2d0585d2f3afc2c4a0776afc1388d2aa	PANTERA  dont forget DIMEBAG.

39b6532a3d7422a2ef0e6b56dd1c66beaa	That's been a subject of debate ever since the movie was released.  Arthur C. Clarke did release a book a couple of years later titled "The Lost Worlds of 2001."  In it he described the process of writing the screenplay, and included many of the alternate scenes (and endings!) that were written before it reached it's final form.    Here's a thumbnail explanation:  The monoliths are machines the product of an alien species with an extremely advanced technology.  The first one arrives on earth, and changes the brains of primitive humans.  (It makes them smarter.)    Tens of thousands of years later, man is exploring the moon, and discovers a second monolith.  It was buried there so it would not be found until man reached that level of development.  It sends out a signal, and mankind sends a ship to the where the signal was sent.  There, a third monolith is found in orbit, and it turns out to be one end of a transportation system.  Astronaut Frank Poole is sent... somewhere.  There, he experiences a strange reality, as yet another monolith alters him, and advances him to a more evolved state.    In the end you see the star child, which is a symbolic representation of Poole's new state.|`|d20a5da34a236b3c2d21503b2f61dabcaa	I don't know, I was on acid when I watched it.

RwfwcS94aa	my high school spanish teacher taught me this:<br>  say "pot of tea" out loud, as fast as you can, over and over again, and try to pronunciate as much as possible. pay attention to what your tounge does while your saying it, and after a while you will learn how to control that movement of your tongue|`|nVoz9g1daa	I was wondering the same thing. All my family members can do it but I can't. Every now and then I can do it but not for very long and I don't even know how I do it!! Lol. Good luck!!|`|d0c0e5d252e5c7992c7dba1dc119d4a2aa	You can roll your R's at the back of your throat like some French speakers do. Doing it that way is a little bit easier, and it may help you eventually move to the front of your tongue, it helped me when I taught myself. <br>  <br>  To start off try making hacking sounds at the back of your throat, like a really hard H sound... then try holding it. Once you get this concept down, rolling at the front of the tongue should be mugh easier. Let me know if it works for you, and good luck!|`|vN4v4fR2aa	It's hard to explain. I'll try, though.<br>  <br>  First, you curl the tip of your tongue upword, like making a "luh" sound without the sound. Then, force your breath out of your mouth without moving your tongue.  If you do it right, you make your tongue vibrate and make the purring-type sound.|`|xjZNnFLtaa	Make that Brrr noise that people make when they are cold.  Mouth closed and brrrrr, then you have found the place where the sound comes from.  Good luck.  I still cant do that two-finger whistle that guys do and some girls do!

Don't worry at all. I had mine out when I was eight. Don't be worried at all. They put you out. You'll be sore after, but you get to eat lots of treats and they wheel you in a wheel chair to go to the bathroom! I was very, very sick, so I didn't eat a thing and I just laid there, but everyone else was sitting up and talking so you'll probably be like them. Don't be afraid at all! :)|`|UZcUIfwIaa	Of course your scared but I'm sure it'll be a great improvement on the infections you've probably been having.

AA12340086	Yes.  People are correct in advising you to use toothpaste.  But don't wipe in circles.  It even says on most CD cases the proper way to clean a CD is to wipe from the inside out.

1ed294ec834d2216e7bf51172304296caa	Hmmmm....this is a hardone. I grew up watching shows such as Gilligan's Island (real and cartoon), Casper, Road Runner, Bugs Bunny, The Munsters (real and cartoon), Scooby Doo, Space Ghost, Tom & Jerry, Jinx the Cat and the Meeses. So to choose my favorite is hard. I would say in life I am closest to Gilligan, yet I would want to be Shaggy if I was a character. Why because I alreadt eat like him, and my best friend is a huge dog. Yet my vote because of the most laughs for the longest amount of time, due to still showing: BUGS BUNNY!|`|78b7413d1fa5171d9b54b0c81c6af361aa	I USE TO LUV WATCHING THE SMURFS.

2f2d0585d2f3afc2c4a0776afc1388d2aa	why do you care you bashed metallica you obvisoly do not have good taste in music.  Metallica is an icon.  they changed the music world and you say all their albums are terrible.  Put your head in a puddle and take a deep breath.    there were two songs in the season finale  GRACE" by Kate Havnevik.     Im on my knees  only memories   are left for me to hold    Dont know how   but Ill get by   Slowly pull myself together     Theres no escape  So keep me safe  This feels so unreal    Nothing comes easily   Fill this empty space   Nothing is like it seems  Turn my grief to grace    I feel the cold  Loneliness unfold  Like from another world    Come what may  I wont fade away  But I know I might change     Nothing comes easily   Fill this empty space   Nothing is like it was  Turn my grief to grace    Nothing comes easily   Where do I begin?  Nothing can bring me peace  Ive lost everything   I just want to feel your embrace      and chasing cars by SNOW PATROL.    We'll do it all   Everything   On our own     We don't need   Anything   Or anyone     If I lay here   If I just lay here   Would you lie with me and just forget the world?     I don't quite know   How to say   How I feel     Those three words   Are said too much   They're not enough     If I lay here   If I just lay here   Would you lie with me and just forget the world?     Forget what we're told   Before we get too old   Show me a garden that's bursting into life     Let's waste time   Chasing cars   Around our heads     I need your grace   To remind me   To find my own     If I lay here   If I just lay here   Would you lie with me and just forget the world?     Forget what we're told   Before we get too old   Show me a garden that's bursting into life     All that I am   All that I ever was   Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see     I don't know where   Confused about how as well   Just know that these things will never change for us at all     If I lay here   If I just lay here   Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

fT7cp20baa	I wouldn't ever want to live in a place like that, first ppl dont have any personality, and there is a hell of alot more discrimination, sure its not about color but more genetic discrimination like how they had a rating system for ppl like how the cripple was a 9.3 also wat you do is determined no autonomous descisions but then we could always push ourselves like victor did and beat his brother and live longer than he was suppose to. i dont know about the brother even with all his "good" genes he still is inferior to victor somehow he is unable to go past his potential like victor did.  sure you can get rid of different diseases like heart conditions and stuff like that but that just takes away the adventure of life, lets say victors dad did not look at his "life" when he was born would that change the way he thought about both of his sons instead of upholding one better than the other or is that just bad parenting? i dont really care for the government so that whole we have your dna in file and anyone can just take a sample of hair to get you "analyzed" really freaks me out i like my autonomous decision to give ppl my identity, like i hate having to wear a name tag at work bc ppl will know my name, its mine why should I let you know it.

Basterebbe cambiare canale, ma poi che cosa ti trovi in cambio? La TV italiana fa veramente pena e siamo arrivati ad uno stato di demenzialit preoccupante!  Anche se molti non ne parlano bene vorrei escludere (un pochino) Rai 3 anche perch talvolta trasmette qualche buon programma anche culturale. Fino a quando avremo a che fare con degli incompetenti alla stesura dei palinsesti e accetteremo di pagare un canone RAI (sempre pi esoso) senza averne una giusta contropartita purtroppo dovremo accettare quanto ci proporranno, diversamente si pu ricorrere alla Pay per wiew (sky tv) ma anche loro non sono proprio il massimo, anzi negli ultimi tempi sono notevolmente peggiorati, anche se l qualcosa di buono lo trovi ancora.|`|3f1668cd4a154a0fa8f493a79f1791c3aa	Ognuno  libero di spegnere il televisore per non guardare!ma hai ragione BASTA SIAMO SATURI!!!!!|`|9472f60f2cbe27ab68e5f0a23db18e40aa	Purtroppo abbiamo la televisione che ci meritiamo.

"You can't get out of your room?" the captain asked, "Why not?"

So when you listen to songs with lyrics that can turn you on they certainly will. you have to choose the kind of songs you listen to if you don't want to be turned on.

You get the same experience without having to plug your ears - it's a movie, not a rock concert.|`|AA11200298	uh, duh?

If it's too soft people complain of hearing. If it's too loud people complain of being deaf. But nonetheless, it's all part of the experience.|`|AA11870467	No way, the sound is what makes the experience.

AA11780081	Yeah, there are a lot of different kinds.  The professional level ones are pretty pricey, around $100.  You can get some decent ones at around $20 that last fairly long.  You should go to your local guitar store and see what they have.  Monster cables are probably the best, but they are the ones that are really expensive.  Live Wire cables are good, and more affordable.|`|AA11816854	There are alot of good cords out there. The braided ones are a little more expensive but they seem to last a hell of alot longer.

Other songs to check out: Double Dare, In the Flat Field, God in an Alcove, St. Vitus Dance, Stigmata Martyr, Dark Entries, Hair of the Dog, and The Passion of Lovers.

The body stores this left over energy as fat for a future energy source.  The thing is, if you continue to add stored energy, and don't make your body use it, you have exessive weight gain.  Some people have metabolism problems that cause there bodies to store exessive amounts of fat, but if they try to burn it off, there body refuses to let the fat go, causeing them to get sick and burn up muscle tissue instead.|`|AA10694856	ummmm cuz they eat alot|`|AA11018990	b/c they sit by the computer (like me) and eat cookie dough (like me)..l0l ?|`|AA12061176	uh what does this have to do with music???       uh to answer your question....  food can be the case, most of the over-weight ppl in my family is due to low metabolism..... heck i look the way i am,is a gene that i get through my mother's family... do't get me wrong.. i am just over-weight by 15 - 20 pounds no more.....  but it can be carried through a gene or it can just be total BOREDOM.... when you don't have anything to do... then you eat and then your waistline increases......|`|AA11149057	Well, in my definition of life the word "fat" has two explanations.   Either they are naturally born fat or they sit on their butts all day long and have no idea how to do 20 push-ups.     You see, it doesn't have to be about eating too much food but it can also mean NOT being active. Some people fantasize about some day becoming "less over weight" but don't realize that instead of imagining and hoping they can simply accomplish that goal by getting up, dedicating an hour per day and be surprised. But no, hoping is easier and takes less time. It shouldn't come as a surprise if you are determine to achieve that goal and do so, you deserve it.     Having said that, think about it, would you like to spend the rest of your life 'wanting' to loose weight or get up one day with this sudden desire to exercise. Oh and I'm not referring to specifically you. However, people can eat all they want. Extra large fries, burger with a diet coke. Now you see that trick, 'diet' coke! There's hope. Always. Just exercise it off of ya! Okay, I rest my case. People get fat. I don't see how my argument helped :)|`|AA12192428	they overeat and do not excercise enough to burn off the excess calories the they take in (out of balance)|`|88c5d278795091d52618e9117986e149aa	i dont know i guess they cant help it|`|b62dce28f6e39dd97553c05a4eebed6eaa	usually because they sit down all and stay in an a/c place all day|`|AA12026634	because they eat too much.|`|AA11108935	Some research indicates that, based on the explosion of obese people and the pattern of the increase, it may actually be due to an infectious agent such as a virus.|`|AA12005817	well, yeah because of food, but sometimes ppl's metabolism isn't as great as others, and so the others lose faster than them, and then there's excercise; some people love to excercise [ the skinnier ones] and others don't do it [ the "fatter" ones] also, it depends on their diet-  if a person's eating chocolate all day long, they are gaining over 5000 calories per day, while ppl that balance it out, and eat more veggies and fruits, they get a good-shaped body.|`|AA10082019	the same way I did. too much food and not enough exercise|`|AA10570283	They get fat from having to read stupid questions like this.|`|bc2946dcc4c68e0564460b42629864beaa	fatty food and metabolism|`|AA12204407	alot of ppl are born fat because of their metabolism is slow  some skinny ppl eat just as much as some fat ppl that is a big problem that is why ppl need certain diets for their certain body types

52f2e77c3f2d04a41d59259120cd7af5aa	Okay, feel free to contact me via email about this as I could help you further if you need it.    There are too many variables in this equation for me to give you an answer.  Like, are you on Windows, MAC OS or something else like Linux?  Your comment about being "not too savy" leads me to think either MAC or Windows.    If you're on a MAC, it's pretty darn easy.  You can purchase a small adapter to connect the RCA ouput of your Turntable to your MAC.  (usually via a USB or FIREWIRE gizmo - belkin etc.)  For more advanced control you can purchase hardware from manufacturers like M-Audio.    I know similar gizmology exists for Windows, but not sure on the recording software that you would utilize on a consumer level.    With MAC, you can use your iLife goodies, like GarageBand, to record the tracks and output them to .mp3's for use in iTunes etc.    So, here's what I reccomend:    Go to tucows and see what free downloads are available.    Head up to CompUSA and see what input devices are available for your computer.  If you are on a windows computer, depending on the model and brand, you may be limited.    Cheers and good luck.|`|2f2d0585d2f3afc2c4a0776afc1388d2aa	itunes the program will take your cds and put them on the ipod.|`|AA10332767	First, you probably need to get an adapter from Radio Shack to connect the turntable to the computer. To figure out what you need, look at the turntable's output (red and yellow or white "rca" jacks?) and your computer's audio input (on the sound card, probably a single "mini" jack) and get the appropriate adapter. Then you'll probably want some software that will convert the input into MP3 files as you go (I used MusicMatch years ago, but there are others out there). Once you have the MP3s you can import them into your iTunes library (iTunes has an import utility built in). From there they automatically go onto the iPod. I hope this helps!

They started the "thrash" revolution and gave birth to a whole new wave of metal.They encompass a wide range of guitar styles in one song, starting from a acoustic intro to a explosion of fast guitar solo techniques toward the end of their songs. In the 80's, "metal" was coined by bands like Poison, Ratt, Bon Jovi and Motley Crue. In the late 80s Metallica formed and gave the genre a different twist. After Metallica came similar bands such as Testament, Slayer, and Pantera. |`|U0Mdh2Axaa	Pantera. Metallica is good but they strayed to far from their original rawness at times.

There seems to be some confusion on the web tonight involving Shakira and Shakir Stewart. Shakira the blond bombshell is touring the world selling out stadiums and arenas left and right. Shakir Stewart was the Executive Vice President of Def Jam and he has died. Shakir Stewart committed suicide at the beginning of November by shooting himself in the head. Shakir Stewart fiancee Michelle Rivers made a statement to the press that Shakir was not acting like himself in the weeks leading up to his death. Anyway to set the record straight Shakira the singer is fine and dandy but Shakir Stewart has died.|`|V1viDlRGaa	Shaky behind syndrom|`|GNe0iLOqaa	shakira died?i'm gonna look it up|`|7reyNyVzaa	shakira died???omg!!when????|`|00dd6625612a9abb468f6308b8ae2692aa	what are u talking about????

41e0ba329a74f8a62bee1467c5fc9fb0aa	Of course. The Earth's Children series has taken the author many years of reasearch to write. The books came out in 1980,1982,1985,1990 and 2002. The 6th in the series is still not complete. It may take you a long time to write, but as long as it doesn't take that long to read, someone will read your book. Good luck with your writing and never give it up!|`|17d6412d640086c29fe389a4aee40ff2aa	They would if they were interesting.  However, much of what you've suggested has already been done.  For example, on Star Trek: The Next Generation, there was an episode in which Lt. Tasha Yar was killed and several crewmembers held hostage by a living tar pit that was made up of the evil thoughts of another species that they had casted off before leaving to settle on another planet...sounds a little like your Heaven and Hell.  Sci-fi and space books are interesting, but make sure there's original material between the "homages" of other shows.|`|49a7876e36acba7210a4271e6d5e55edaa	Your book idea does sound great. SciFi fans would eat it up.    However, I'd avoid taking ideas from other authors. Maybe you could rethink your plot and story details that come from other sources- you're clearly creative, so make up something different. For the ship, maybe change it's shape, coloring, engine, etc. It's SciFi- you can makeup facts and equipment and it'll be believable.|`|AA10967060	If it is entertaining people will read it though probably not as one book.  Stephen King wrote the Dark Tower series between 1976 (approx) and 2005 which spanned nearly thirty years and 7 books.  If it is good you might get it published as a serial as the Star Wars series are published as smaller novels.

Thanks for SPOILING it all up. sheesh.    Anyway, Dumbledore dies and Harry's next. I wish. Since JK Rowling said that she'll boot off two MAIN characters.

Remember Voldemort is afraid only of dumbledore.    so i think death of dumbledore may be secret drama between him and snape.|`|e20aa445a3586ac858eb10c36a7802d9aa	I definetly do think that Dumbledore is done for good. This is going to make the series more interesting because Voldemort was onlt staying away because of Dumbledore. Now that Dumbledore is out of the way Voldemort can do whatever he wants pretty much.

AA10899250	The hours are a lot longer. We would start at 8:00 and go all day until 9:00, with a break for lunch and dinner. Then we would have the whole night night to ourselves. I never went a camp with other bands around, so I don't know about the competition stuff, but there was definitely more "partying." After the first morning, I don't think that I was ever on time for any other day. It really sucks to spend your morning outside in the sun, weak from "partying" too much the night before. It got really crazy in college.

This part II was more of a dark pyschological drama wow!  Everybody had issues on top of issues.  I saw the movie as having at least two levels.  Kids might get rather frightened in several parts.  I am not sure if I like Capt. Jack as much as I did in part I. I am not convinced he is a "good man" any more.  We see the selfish, self centered, superficial,vain  cunning - unpleasant sides of the character now  and begin to see the real complex and low brow  sides of pirates.  Hmmmmmm.  But one thing, one must always do is never listen to the critics!  Go see the movie and experience great special effects and makeup artists!  The transformation in the British commadore is fascinating!    Lily|`|AA11200298	Well, for starters, it still IS suitable for kids. And, Jack Sparrow is the main character of the story.    Yes, it did became quite darkish.

His statement from the first film still holds true for Liz: "It would have never worked between us." Other than that POTC is clearly not a KIDS (young kids) movie. ----It's more in the realm of Adult Disney.

AA11449024	Esentially it is an ironic title because zoe, does not die and killing her charater is not the intention of the bank robbery to begin with.      zed protects zoe from harm, and in the end ironically zoe saves zed from being caught.......    I would even argue that the title could have a more literary meaning........    Le petite morte........or the little death is the old metaphor for orgasm.    Since Zoe is a prostitute the title could be in refrence to giving zoe orgasms or rather killing her........    thats just one take though.|`|AA10590903	you know what happed in the end...|`|AA11200298	Because they probably have to kill Zoe.

AA11200298	Heres the basic summary: Before Valentine's Day 2006, Kate leaves a note for the next tenant in the mailbox asking him/her to forward her mail to her new apartment. Kate moves to her new apartment and begins her new job. Even though Alex has now moved into the lake house (2004 his time) and gotten Kate's note, Kate is not aware of it because she is in Chicago and has started her new job. At this point in 2006, Kate has not returned to the lake house.    On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate is having lunch with her mother at Daley Plaza. A man is hit by a bus. Kate goes to his aid and tries to save him, but he dies in her arms. At this point she she has no idea who he is and clearly does not recognize him as the man she made out with at her birthday party back in 2004. I know that this has been a sticking point for a lot of people, but think about it. Back in 2004, Kate came home from the hospital to a surprise party that Morgran threw for her after she clearly said she did not want one. To make it worse they were all Morgan's friends and not hers. She was clearly pissed. Yes, she met Alex and kissed him but he was just some guy that she briefly met for the first time. Quite frankly, I have personally met people at parties, chatted with them for quite some time and don't recognize them two weeks later-it does happen-let it go. Back to 2006, Kate goes back to the hospital after the accident, visibly upset that a man just died in her arms after she gave her best to save him. Her supervisor tells her to go someplace where she most feels like herself on her days off if she's to survive the stress of working in an ER - so she goes back to the lake house.    If Alex had not died on Valentine's Day 2006, Kate would have never had a reason to go back to the lake house and she would have never have found his letter answering her first note to please forward her mail.    After Valentine's Day 2006, Kate finds Alex's (2004 his time) letter in the mailbox when she goes back to visit the lake house. Kate begins to exchange letters (2006 her time) with Alex (2004 his time).    On Kate's birthday in 2006, she thinks back to her birthday party in 2004 and starts to remember the man that asked her about her favorite book-Persuasion by Jane Austen- the book she had recently asked (2006 her time) Alex to go fetch from the train station in his time 2004 because she left it on the bench and it meant a lot to her because her father gave it to her. It's on her birthday in 2006 that she realizes it was Alex that she met and kissed at her birthday party in 2004.    Kate and Alex make a dinner date at Il Mare the next day in her time, 2006, the next day two years later in his time. Kate is stood up at the restaurant because Alex died on Feb. 14, 2006. Alex is still corresponding with Kate in his present of 2004. At this point he is not aware that he died.    After the dinner date, 2006, Kate writes Alex (2004 his time) and tells him he did not show up. He replies that something must have happened, give him time, they'll try again. Kate writes a final letter to Alex 2006 her time, 2004 his time). In it she tells him that she has to stop writing to him. She needs to live in the present and find someone in the present. She tells him that life is too short and can be over in a matter of seconds. She writes that on Valentine's Day 2006, she was eating lunch at Daley Plaza with her mother when a stranger was hit by a bus and died in her arms and she wondered if he had anyone else in the world that was waiting for him.    During 2006 through 2008 her time, Kate hooks back up with her old boyfriend Morgan and tries to forget about Alex.    During 2004 after Kate stops writing and February 14, 2006, the day he died, Alex puts all of Kate's letter along with a few other things into a box, puts it into the attic and moves out of the lake house. He moves to Chicago with his brother and starts the Visionary Vanguard agency.    On Valentine's Day 2006, Alex is leaving the Visionary Vanguard agency with his brother in the morning. He asks his brother if he wants to do something together that night. Henry tells him it's Valentine's Day and he has a date. At that moment Alex remembers the final letter that Kate send and remembers that she said where she was on Valentine's Day 2006. Alex heads back to the lake house to reread that letter.    On Valentine's Day 2008, Kate and Morgan meet with an architect (Henry) at the Visionary Vangurad agency. As she's leaving Kate sees the picture of the lake house on the wall and asks who made it. Henry says his brother, Alex Wyler. When Kate asks where he is, Henry says he died exactly two years ago on Valentine's Day 2006. Kate remembers that in her final letter to Alex (2006 her time, 2004 his time) she told him she was at Daley Plaza on Valentine's Day 2006. She realizes that he came to see her on that day and it was him that was hit by the car.    She races back to the lake house and leaves a note in the mailbox saying that he didn't show up because it was him was killed on Valentine's Day 2006. She loves him and if he cares about her, he will not go to Daley Plaza to see her. She tells him that he needs to wait two more years to meet her and that he can not find her or talk to her during that time he needs to just wait until Valentine's 2008 and meet her at the lake house that day.    While Kate is at the mailbox in 2008, with the flag up because her note is in the box, Alex is in the attic 2006 reading her last letter focusing on the words, I was in Daley Plaza on February 14, 2006. As Alex runs out of the lake house clearly on his way to Daley Plaza in 2006, Kate in 2008 watches the run flag going down signalling that Alex got her warning note in 2006.    On Valentine's Day 2006, Alex goes to Daley Plaza where he takes one last look at Kate but does not step off the curb.

I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge   with as many people as I can.   I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other specific   Biblical laws and how to follow them.    a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a   pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors.   They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?    b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in   Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price   for her?    c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her   period of menstrual uncleanness (Lev.15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell?   I have tried asking, but most women take offense. If I come into contact with   a woman who is menstruating and she doesn't tell me until afterwards, must I   kill her immediately or can I just beat her?    d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female,   provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims  that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify?   Why can't I own Canadians?    e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2   clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill   him myself? Also, is Sabbath on Saturday as Seventh Day Adventists   (Christians, like us...or are they?) or is it on Sunday as Baptists and   some other faiths agree? I am beset by not knowing who to kill and when   to kill them...please clarify this for me.    f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination   (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality (Lev. 18:22).   I don't agree. I'm also confused about how homosexuality can be an abomination   when Jonathan and David were married in the Bible (1 Samuel 18:1, 3 - 4).   Here, I'll quote it - "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of   speaking unto Saul that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David   and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. Then Jonathan and David made a   covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. And Jonathan stripped himself  of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even   to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle." and also Ruth's relationship   with Naomi is suspect, (Ruth 1:16-17) "And Ruth said to Naomi, Entreat me not   to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest,   I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people,   and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried:   the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part three and me.  " Can you settle this?    g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a   defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my   vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?    h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around   their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27 and even   though 1st Cor. 11:4-6 says that it is a shame upon a man to have long hair.   How should they die?    i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me   unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? Also, since it is   strictly forbidden to "eat neither fat nor blood" in Lev. 3:17 & Lev. 19:26,   does that mean that I must be a vegetarian and must I smite those who choose   to eat meat?    j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different   crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two   different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse   and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of   getting the whole town together to stone them (Lev.24:10-16)? Couldn't we just   burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep   with their in-laws (Lev. 20:14)?    k) I know that it is an abomination for a man to wear a woman's clothes or a   woman to wear a man's (Deut. 22:5), so does that mean that since my wife   borrowed my boxers once, she's going to hell?    l) An unbeliever sent me an email telling me that God is an ABORTIONIST? It   says, "In Num. 5:11-31, God commands a husband to get an abortion for his wife   if he suspects she has been impregnated by another man. A priest is to make her   drink a potion and tell her, "If any man other than your husband has had   intercourse with you, may the LORD make an example of you . . . by bringing   upon you miscarriage and untimely birth." To deliberately cause a miscarriage   is to perform an abortion. And who brings about this miscarriage? Who performs   this abortion? It is the LORD who does so. God is an abortionist. In Ex. 21:22-25,   God tells us what to do if a man who is fighting knocks against a pregnant woman.   If the woman dies, the principle of "life for life" is invoked and the man   responsible for her death must be killed. If she lives but has a miscarriage,   then the death of the fetus is to be compensated for by the payment of a fine,   as demanded by the woman's husband. Thus, God has revealed the status of the   unborn fetus: it is not an independent, full-fledged human life, whose   destruction amounts to murder. It is a thing owned by the woma|`|AA11706668	good points  rap sucks|`|AA10841464	Rap is not stupid rap is awesome and you just  need to get a taste of music o wait u have a taste but it sucks|`|c89bdb78053dbde792f6de5d04d3c1a0aa	My little sister listens to rap, and I always ask her the same thing.

But thats just me.|`|d59161ee3cc380c4afd2d9c06687a1a5aa	Once again you are only paying attention to what is being presented to you. Rap is not only about being a gangster a guns and sex and hoes and pimps. that is really not what rap is even about. That style is just what is popular right now. They are celebrating low class living while they live in a mansion. I'm sure there are plenty of bands that you know of that don't get any airplay because you took the time to seek them out. Same goes for rap groups. Alot of groups are doing positive rap music that respect women, speak of peace, do not curse, talk about God, etc...unfortunately it is not popular and it won't sell any records.|`|b3404b2a53686e1a631b974b45c862c6aa	rap is not always about the same thing but the record companies only push a certain type because that is what is most popular...and last i heard, it was young white boys who were buying most of it...SO ROCK ON TO THAT..DUDES!!!

AA10401458	Ashok - A good mix    Life is very strange. Its script is more dramatic than anything that the film industry can come up with. Just around two years ago, NTR Junior was the most promising young star. He was a mass hero whose films were running left, right and center.    But somewhere down the line, the plot went haywire. But NTR Junior is a man of mettle, there is a strong streak of steel in him. He has always like a challenge and a fight.    It is what he thrives in. Give him a crisis, he will overcome it. In Ashok, he is said to have given one of his most spirited performances ever.    Ashok, in simplistic terms, is a typical entertainer with all the expected ingredients. But with Surender Reddy at the helm ---- the man who has given Kalyan Ram a new lease of life ---- the script holds special attraction.    Ashok is about a strong-willed individual who faces adversity with stoical and steely resolve.    Director Surender says the fans would see a new NTR Junior in this film. The film would have love, family drama and emotions'.    NTR Junior has been called upon to fight and dance with gusto and style. He has done that fabulously, says the director.    The films heroine is Sameera Reddy. Now, Sameera is a buzzing sort of girl who loves all out fun. The film has provided her that.    She and NTR Junior share a fine equation. The director has exploited that on the screen.    The films muhurat, held last September, was in itself a special event.    Among others, Chandra Babu Naidu, Bala Krishna, Venkatesh, Hari Krishna and Kalyan Ram were present.    That itself showed that NTR Junior has plenty of goodwill. Now he has to use that and translate into success.    Produced by Valluripally Ramesh who has made films like Avunu Valliddaru Istapaddaru, Kabaddi Kabaddi and Pandem, under Maharshi banner, Ashok is set for release in April.|`|4cf4c7acdcce7b325f7a16911d956efeaa	dont know

9241bfe82cb1162873d04a363c9f830caa	A year after her husband and daughter are killed in a tragic auto accident, a British woman and her adventurous friends go spelunking in the Appalachians.   The trouble starts when one of them, trying to be even more adventurous, deliberately leaves the map behind and takes them down an unexplored section of the cave system...and things get worse when they find they're not alone.       The movie has actually been out overseas for a while (it was a British production), and has even been released on DVD in some places.  I saw it recently--actually a decent movie, but while there are some shots that are painful to watch, it's more of an "Open Water," "Blair Witch" type building-dread creepy than a "Hostel" or "The Hills Have Eyes" type horrorfest.  If you prefer the latter, the movie will take a while before it really gets going for you.|`|b578416537e50f4174d26ad2249f6d16aa	A caving expedition goes horribly wrong, as the explorers become trapped and ultimately pursued by a strange breed of predators...   read more on Imdb.com.

3f7fb9d7fda76c281a4316b674937bcfaa	Red is supposedly the first color perceived by Man. Brain-injured persons suffering from temporary color-blindness start to perceive red before they are able to discern any other colors. Neolithic hunter peoples considered red to be the most important color endowed with life-giving powers and thus placed red ochre into graves of their deceased. This explains funds of skeletons embedded in up to 10 kg of red powdered ochre. Neolithic cave painters ascribed magic powers to the color red. The word "magic" ("Zauber" in German) translates to "taufr" in Old Norse and is related to the Anglo-Saxon "teafor" meaning "red ochre". It can be stipulated that they painted animals in red ochre or iron oxide to conjure their fertility.    Protective powers of the color red against evil influence were common belief. Objects, animals and trees were covered in red paint, warriors painted their axes and spear-catapults red to endow the weapons with magic powers. Some of the Australian aborigines abide by this custom up to the present times. Neolithic hunters and germanic warriors used to paint their weapons and even themselves in blood of slain animals. Roman gladiators drank blood of their dying adversaries to take over their strength. In other cultures, the newly born were bathed in blood of particularly strong and good looking animals.Red painted amulettes or red gems, such as ruby or garnet, were used as charms against the "evil eye". Wearing a red ruby was supposed to bring about invincibility. Red bed-clothes were customary in Germany up to the Middle Ages as protection against the "red illnesses", such as fever, rashes or even miscarriages (famous example is the painting Arnolfini Wedding by Jan Van Eyck, dated 1434).    Red rose is the symbol of love and fidelity. According to the Greek legend red roses arised from blood of Adonis who was killed by a wild boar on a hunt. In Greek mythology red rose was a symbol for the cycle of growth and decay, but also for love and affinity. Red rose is dedicated to Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and daughter of Zeus and also to Roman goddess Venus. In Christianity the red rose is associated with the Cross and the bloodshed.    There are also negative connotations of this color. Israelites in biblical times painted their doorframes in red blood to scare demons. Red in ancient Egypt was the color of the desert and of the destructive god Seth who inpersonated the Evil. "Making red" was synonymous with killing someone, evil doings were refered to as "red affairs". Salvation from Evil is the subject of an ancient Egyptian charm: "Oh, Isis, deliver me from the hands of all bad, evil, red things!" Writers of Egyptian papyri used a special red ink for nasty words.    Good and bad qualities are combined in Phoenix, the firebird. In Egypt, China and Central America it was associated with cleansing and revival. In China its name was the "Vermilion Bird" or the Substance of Fire" and promised luck and longevity.    By the way in China there are more than 30 single characters to describe various shades of red. The Chinese are passionate about the color|`|d9e8da6073a8231422880336801d9dd9aa	represents passion.|`|3d6ff17531d11bf032d717594c7955deaa	how did the color blue come to represent sadness and depression?|`|b68a35a4a89094e39d14cf072854d3a4aa	Because it is the color of your Heart. :)|`|AA11603317	Dunno.

AA12343985	Yeah, but the less tax he has to pay, the more he can give away for charity.    He's been chastising the Canadian government for not giving more as well.|`|AA11317725	I never liked him or his political views. Truth will always reveal a hypocritical person whether they are a celebrity or not.|`|88ae613a4828970a2e0c170c6507eb77aa	Before you knock him just remember the many  years he has devoted to helping raise awareness of poverty and Aids in Africa. His input and dedication was/is sincere. By lending his name and badgering the warhawks in the Whitehouse he has helped raise not just awareness globally of the problems facing Africa but also raised many Millons of $.'s in desperately needed donations.    He sings with the world's most sucessful bands. They've made money not by being popular but because they have made good business sense in choosing a shrewd manager, as you famioly have, if you are from the same Von Furstenberg brand. So I would say that the decision to move their money offshoe though I don't agree with it,  was made by his manager Paul McGuinnes who has managed and guided this band for over 20 years now and made them a fortune in the process, while also ensuring their enduring popularity.    I am sure that his heart is in the right place and will continue to be. With his fortune, million he could be leading the life of a frivolous playboy, and he is not, he spends months in Africa, visiting pwoerty stricken village, hospitals, talking to their staff, their government. He really has a big heart.    When you compare him to skinflint notorious  tightass Mick Jagger (or Sting),  who has a personal fortune of almost $100Million and does nothing for charity. Jagger is a frugal  tighfist who prefers to chase skirt than help a charity. So there really is no comparison. Jagger is mean overrated musician who does absoluely nothing for anyone least of all a deserving charity. He has his money stashed offshore. But at least Bono does spend his time campaiging and badgering Bush and Blair.    I still think that Bono should have left his money in Ireland. After all it was Ireland's tax breaks that helped him in his early career. He should remeber that and not turn his back on Ireland, His taxes could now help other young artists.

AA10084738	Music has been a rich source of entertainment since the ages. It still continues to throb the hearts of many. In todays advanced technological world there are many gadgets which are kept by the users with them always like I-pod, walkman etc. There was time of Cassettes, CDs, DVDs and now is the time of recording music in USB drives and listening to it at ur leisure time. Sometimes we need to buy music chores and sometimes we get it free from our friends or relatives. Internet is gaining ground everyday in everybodys life.

HAHAHAH!!!!|`|0f62e8661e9892c395d8bae841ad7035aa	No, I don't think so.

I think the right winger bible thumpers who spout that crap out have no idea what they are talking about.     All they want to do is limit free speech and expression.    First they want to ban and burn books, then they want to dictate what you can and can not listen too, then they want control over the video games you play...    Better be careful... they are watching you!|`|d8c7e360b20f76f51d06323105502ee7aa	if your talking rap then yeah

IT COMES FIRST IN THE SENTENCE.|`|b4f1de7687723b3a954877be070863e4aa	i depends on how u look at it|`|AA10401458	The chicken or the egg is a reference to the causality dilemma which arises from the expression "which came first, the chicken or the egg?". Since both the chicken and the egg create the other in certain circumstances (a chicken emerges from an egg; an egg is laid by a chicken) it is ambiguous which originally gave rise to the other. Purely logical attempts to resolve the dilemma result in an infinite regress, since an egg was caused by a chicken, which was caused by an egg, etc. Since every chicken originates from its egg, it seems obvious the egg came first. Put simply, the reason is down to the fact that genetic material does not change during an animal's life. The solution may require an examination of syntax and may rely on verification from advances in modern genetic science. When used in reference to difficult problems of causality, the chicken and egg dilemma is often used to appeal to the futility of debate and lay it to rest.

For a free birthchart go to www.astrology.com  Libra is the Seventh sign of the Zodiac. It is sometimes referred to as the Libra the Balance. The Sun enters Libra around the time of year when day and night are of equal length. Thus, this is when the Earth and the Sun are in balance...a time such balance is also illustrated by the fact that when the Sun reaches this point, Spring and Summer have passed and the harvesters are weighing and balancing the fruits of their labors. Now, the beginning of Autumn heralds the Harvest Season. The origin of the word Libra derives from the Latin meaning "balances" or "scales." Often, a statue of the Goddess of Justice holding the scales or balances is erected over the domes of modern court houses. In ancient times, this constellation was associated with the judgment of the living and the dead. Libra is the only inanimate Sign of the Zodiac, the other eleven representing either human or animal forms. Those born under this Sign are natural arbitrators and diplomats, constantly seeking balance and harmony. In short, they are sociable, cheerful and charming souls. Perhaps the greatest fault of this Sign is indecision. Libra individuals find it difficult to make up their minds and strongly dislike taking sides. Although they have an aversion to those who are rude, they themselves can frequently be disconcertingly brash and blunt. Nonetheless, some astrologers consider Libra to be the most desirable of all Zodiac types because it represents the zenith of the year. Libra is representative of balance...the weighing of values and justice. When those ruled by this Zodiac Sign manage to bring balance into their lives and curtail the inherent tendency to waver from one side to the other, then they will find the contentment that is so necessary to their well-being.The symbol...or glyph...of Libra is generally considered to be a representation of the Beam of the Balance. However, in ancient times, it was thought to depict the top of the Euphratean Altar. Of course, the standard image is that of the scales, indicative of balance, equilibrium and justice...a sign of cosmic reciprocity and cooperation rather than competion. It is also said to be the Spirit in its material expression, ready to ascend back to its original pristine state...the junction point of the world and that which is beyone. In some cultures, this glyph is said to symbolize the setting Sun as it descends over the horizon and a more lowly description that has been given to this symbol is that of a humpback bridge.Also known as the Sign of the Judge or Ambassador, Libra is Positive in polarity (as are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius and Aquarius). The general characteristics of Positive Signs broadly match those for the extrovert personality and such individuals are naturally more impulsive, buoyant, communicative and sociable than are the Zodiac Signs of Negative polarity (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces). However, Positive Signs rarely display the same levels of sensitivity or the same depth of understanding of emotional subtleties as do their Negative counterparts. Positive Signs tend to crave excitement and thus, are inclined to direct their energies outward into the world around them. Aries is the most flagrantly extrovert of the Positive Signs (with Sagittarius a close second).All Zodiac Signs governed by the Elements of Fire and Air are considered to be Masculine in nature. Thus, Libra (ruled by air) is considered Masculine (as are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius and Aquarius). Masculine signs are traditionally conceived as being more active and less receptive than their Feminine counterparts which are ruled by the Elements of Earth and Water (the Zodiac Signs of Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces). Masculine Signs focus primarily on spirituality and activity...both in the physical sense and mental sense. Masculine Signs are said to be diurnal or day-oriented. Therefore the term "masculine" should be viewed in the same light as the Yang (or bright) Polarity of the Tao.Libra is the natural ruler of the Seventh House of the Zodiac, commonly referred to as the "House of Marriage, Partnerships and Open Enemies" and known in Vedic Astrology as the "Setting Place." It is here that the "I" is said to convert to the "we." In this House may be found an individual's closest friends and sweethearts, as well as open enemies. It represents the gateway to relationships that serve a higher purpose, but not necessarily daily needs. It is here that lessons are learned related to the love of enemies and the finding of true friends. This House also deals with joint ventures and is associated with legal matters, negotiations, contracts and all open confrontations...pleasant and adversarial. The Seventh House dictates how a person will act in public and the type of public such an individual is likely to attract. Also sometimes known as the "House of Association," it influences acts of accomplishment and the quality of cooperation. The focus of the Seventh House also includes the darker side of relationships, such as divorce and lawsuits. Basically, this House provides the field of experience in which an individual is challenged to develop committed partnerships with others and is governed by the Planet Venus (also Planetary Ruler of the Second House).  The opposite sign to Libra is Aries. From Aries, Libra can learn to take the initiative and sometimes stand up for beliefs without manipulation. Thus, can Libra natives navigate the way to find their own identity.  Positive Traits: easygoing, sociable, peaceable, idealistic, diplomatic, urbane, romantic, charming and refined  Negative Traits: flirtatious, self-indulgent, indecisive, lazy, changeable, guillable, resentful, frivolous and easily influenced by others  Likes: gentleness, sharing, conviviality and the "finer" things of life  Dislikes: injustice, violence, brutishness, disharmony, quarrel|`|797deeb803e5e94dcbfe74bd3b37a563aa	Libra|`|AA12351611	you are 100 % a SCORPIO.THIS STARSIGN STARTS FROM 23 OCTOBER TO 22 NOVEMBER.SINCE THE BEGINNING YOU HAVE QUALITIES BOTH OF LIBRA AND SCORPIO.YOU ARE DEFINATELY A SCORPIO.

But the answer to the question is, YES, we are far too dependent on technology and all things synthetic. Imagine if we lost all our satellites, radios and digital media for even a couple days! Not to mention years. All of our food, fuel, transport and money is based on technology. A geomagnetic storm, CME, or solar flare could cause us to lose those things pretty quick and what percentage of the population would die in big cities? We should try to become less dependent on those things.

zYKb2Msmaa	Most men don't expect their girlfriends to dress sexy for them all the time.  Its nice, when you go out or you want to surprise each other, as it keeps things "spicy" between you, but I think its good to get comfortable with each other in "lounging" clothes or dress down at times (jeans, t shirts, sweatshirts).  If a Man judges a women completely on how sexy she is or what she wears, I think that's pretty shallow.  Their is more than just dressing sexy.  Don't misunderstand me, as a Man, I do enjoy a women that dresses Sexy, as it means she cares and wants to look good.|`|1m9988e1aa	my girlfriend does not dress sexy at all. i love her with all my heart. she does not feel sexy because she has a little more for me to love. i told her size and looks don't matter. what does matter is her inner beauty her heart and her brains. she has a pretty face and never wears makeup i am used to her looking like that and i love it because she is happy and that is all that matters to.|`|mMBPOjbFaa	i would still love my girlfriend if she was wearing pajama pants had no makeup on and hadnt done her hair   shes beautiful to me no matter what she does and her clothes dont make her sexy she does|`|NGTuXvM8aa	I get more compliments from my guy when I'm in sweats and a t shirt then when I dress up. Sometime I actually feel dissed when he doesn't seem to notice when I dress up|`|L2UUj2hjaa	What kinda question is this? Not all guys will, but not all guys wont. Those that wont, don't love them. Those that do love them, wont or shouldn't care. I would not. She'd be hella sexy anywhere anytime !

YV2n51hqaa	I think about this a lot...and here are my results  It depends on the situation, and what you think is right. Only you can decide what to do and how/when to influence others with your words. When it is your time to speak and when you think it is right then speak.  Do what you think is right. I have many sayings that I believe in which help me dictate what I should do with my life, my actions, and my voice"  -When I am in a bad situation or can't forget something (like wanting revenge) I just tell myself "It can't be helped or it is not worth getting angry over."  -Do what you want and influence others lives in a positive way in whichever way possible. In other words, be nice or treat others the way you want to be treated  - well there are a lot for different situations...but it all boils down to "follow your heart." only you can decide for yourself...it is called Free Will|`|ipqWxJyGaa	If I understood you correctly, the speaking is not in question- you shouldn`t speak... What matters is thinking, right?    Well, thinking is good. I wish i did that more often. LOL|`|mggll8dRaa	Best to use Hand Signals....!!|`|4k5MkmInaa	Confusing question,got me thinking...    it's always better to think before you do anything.    sometimes there's no point in speaking when the person you're talking to is ignorant,but is better to think before you decide not to speak.    Or else you wouldn't think of not to speak.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	think before u speak is better.. BINGO!

FAaePWPWaa	Why should we move on. His music is classic and timeless. If your're saying to move on from Tupac then we might as well move on from:  Biggie  The Beatles   and all the other greats.   If you don't like Tupac fine then that's you but don't tell other people to move on.|`|zVdNQowNaa	Me?...so I guess a 33-year old, black male, ex-convict..wow.    Pac was a great lyricist, I never moved back. I didn't move on because I didn't know him, I enjoy his music and I have the right to listen to him, for real. He released his emotions on a track and spoke his mind, I like that.|`|BnTYoxUIaa	First answer is retarded|`|OpBFc27iaa	i still listen to tupac, YA PUNK|`|ZQCX1O4zaa	y wuld ya even ask dat?....cuz hes one of da greatest rappas eva|`|q7sX6ACraa	people like me..  :)|`|HxYDy3kGaa	his music will live forever,  he is a legend, and he spoke from his heart.  amazing artist, best of all time.|`|Y0IlOTOqaa	Yeah!

Those who are growing up in this decade that are tired of meaningless mainstreamed rap (like Lil Wayne and 50 Cent..gah) and may not have lived his life or struggled as much as he did, but know people who have. Tupac's music is relatable on all levels.|`|wZV2eaOmaa	To some people, music isn't a fad. You listen to what you like, and you don't stop just because it's not on the radio as much anymore.|`|B2mgD3L4aa	Are you kidding??!!   Tupac is a musically, poetically, lyrically inclined LEGEND. He spoke about legendary theories and concepts, ways of life. He was a Hip Hop politician. Asking this question is like asking an English or Drama teacher to move on and forget about Sheakspear.

ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|u3xDS7i8aa	WOOT WOOT! spell checker! you got it!|`|Cif3gYmFaa	didn't like me back|`|5960d486044fcfd01d576d4d11ecbc09aa	he told me that he knew that i liked him, i sat next to him in class and during teh star spangled banner i cried i dont know why tho? well after that i always sat with my back to him :(|`|h00bqU7baa	The first day I went out with my boyfriend we were walking around and my pants started sqeaking out of no where.

u0WBxL2Caa	Hi,  the short answer is yes he is dead but the long answer is no he is not. Throughout the matrix there is a lot of Christian symbolism and the end of Revolutions is one example. When you see Neo 'explode' into white light he does so in a cross shape. Neo's very character is supposed to represent Christ our saviour who died and rose again.    "Neo's body emanates white light, probably not a healthy occurrence for a flesh and blood organism, fueling speculation that his body is dead. But his mind, his consciousness, his memories...those could easily be downloaded into the machine mainframe to be born again if needed."    Hope this answers your question.|`|LAIC5Yvyaa	Neo and Smith are both dead. The Oracle said Neo could not exist without Smith.|`|0G3XyZqeaa	Dead, so is Trinaty

Good cereal  though,  it makes  me  have to  go to the  bathroom|`|pyM3Soj9aa	maybe they are raisins|`|IuhSyW2Raa	Grape-Nuts is a breakfast cereal developed by C. W. Post in 1897. Post was a patient and later competitor of the 19th-century breakfast food innovator, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. Neither grapes nor nuts have ever been ingredients in the cereal. The original formula for Grape-Nuts called for grape sugar, which is composed mostly of glucose unlike most other sugar sources and food sweeteners which are principally sucrose. This, combined with the "nutty" flavor of the cereal inspired its name|`|648748e102274ee37ff41f571e2edaa1aa	lol!!! i was wondering that myself the other day|`|vXFpzKRaaa	The cereal's original formula contained maltose, known at the time as "grape sugar," and it had a nutty flavor.  This is how the name came to be.|`|m7nrQEflaa	I like the cereal but I don't know where the name came from|`|IizPFrELaa	They come from red or dark grapes, the seed or nut is in the center of it.|`|zBRaqw21aa	Nuts that taste like grapes?|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	se|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	I'm assuming they're appetizers served with cocktail weenies...

mNiCmPShaa	I am ALL FOR the death penalty.    Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking "'what a hypocrite, she says she's all against killing and such and then turns around and watches executions"... well hear me out    The reason why I am pro-life is because the life in question here hasn't even begun. It knows not from its left and right, knows not from right and wrong... it is innocent in all aspects of the word. So why would you take away such a life? For selfish reasons, that's why.    On the other hand, the death penalty actually serves a purpose. It cleanses our world of those who are against the norm, and who have committed unspeakable crimes. This life in question was given a chance, and it lead to it's own demise through it's actions. Ofcourse, one would have to prove that this person is guilty, without even an atoms size of doubt.    So before you misconstrue my answer, I'll sum it up for you... Before an abortion or a death penalty the question that needs to be asked is: 'Do they deserve this?'    If the answer is no, let him go, if it is yes, then you know what to do. Don't you see, it's fool proof, b/c no matter how much of an idiot you are, you'll never say that a baby did wrong...|`|4Ap8c1TJaa	no.  no abortion.  no death penalty.  i'm pro-life!  increase the peace.|`|S4CXs5qbaa	babies should get a chance at life...    not death row inmates|`|G3NBadmmaa	I'm a Christian and I believe in the Bible...yea bring on the thumbs down...don't care! The bible clearly states and eye for an eye...there was not an option given and I don't think there should be today whether someone who kills gets to die or live the rest of their life behind bars...better than some innocent homeless people I might add...abortion is different...that baby has done nothing wrong and does deserve the right to life!|`|d18f728af56b92a75c98354a550c9fe7aa	I think it's acceptable|`|jHvcZzD7aa	I'm not pro-abortion, I'm pro-choice.  Like the women with 6 kids who recently had octuplets, o.O  I don't think you should just be allowed to have abortion after abortion without using birth control either, there should be limits.    I think the death penalty is nessecary (sp?) but there are several people killed by lethal injection that seemed to be innocent.  But, I think it is nessecary when it is known who the killer is.  especially for murdering children... does that person then ahve a right to live?|`|3opnkGFDaa	Abortion is wrong, the death penalty is wrong. you wanna know why??? because the people who are executing these poor souls DIDN'T CREATE THEM! WHAT RIGHT DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE THEIR LIVES??? THE ONLY BEING THAT GETS TO DECIDE WHETHER WE LIVE OR DIE IS GOD BECAUSE HE CREATED US! HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WISHES WITH US.|`|TgskOPC6aa	i disagree with abortion its murder of a innocent chid!   the death penalty is killing someone who is NOT INNOCENT!|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	i personally think that death penalty is harsh  and they really shouldn't do it  no matter what the crime is, it's already bad that one life is gone  why take another.  i just don't like the fact that people are killing someone to get even  to me that's kinda juvenille (not literally)  death penalty is wrong anything with killing is wrong|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	I actually think....if someone has killed someone else....well....they probably deserve it.....but.....I dunno...that's a very controversial subject....I can't really say one way or the other 100%|`|30Q1007vaa	I'm not against abortion, Thats the womens choice, and the death penalty.....Only for very serious crimes I think|`|BCebZRu3aa	Shouldn't this be in the Politics or Religion sections? We are just trying to have fun here. Why so morbid?|`|P8uh4joQaa	It's cheaper to lock someone up for life than it is to house them on death row. I also think we shouldn't play god and decide who should live and die. I heard something once like "Why do we kill people, who kill people, to show people killing is wrong?"|`|5mIhU9KAaa	i'm only for abortion if it was something dealing with rape. if it is simply 2 people having sex w/out a condom then i don't think it's right. as for the death penalty i'm pretty much for it only if somebody is found to have intentionally committed a homicide. if it was by accident, like a drunk driver killed somebody, i wouldn't put the death penalty but definitely a long time in jail. so there you go.|`|fgPEOWuxaa	i am not against abortion or the death penalty or the electric chair, criminals deserve to be punished.|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	Death penalty is unusual and cruel noone has the right to play god. However every woman has the right to get rid of an unwanted FETUS,|`|1YNFFfmWaa	I think that it is terrible to kill another human even if they committed a crime.|`|ENAEcBOmaa	i am against both. God will decide our deaths and it is his job on judgment day.|`|zRUHryuraa	Some people deserve death. But everyone deserves the chance to live|`|GcMAJYXXaa	Who knows, they can be the next President, or the one to find the cure for cancer. & I know maaany might oppose to me -____- but I think give them a chance to live, it's not their fault. ADOPTION I'll prefer than killing.|`|e6JRzlpRaa	I believe in the right to life!!! For both guilty and innocent!!! Life is a God given right. Who am I to disagree????

I met about 30 or 40 people on here. 10 who probably have become the best friends a girl can have.    When I recently got some rather unfortunate news they've all rallied around me and offered me support that I would have been unable to get from my real life friends.  They're with me every step of the way and there is always someone here for me any time of the day.   And none of them has given me superficial offers of support. When they have said email me or call me, they meant email me or call me and they have spent hours on the phone or in emails with me making me laugh, consoling me, or just listening to me cry.     Everyone does their own little part. Some comfort me, some make me laugh, some b*tch with me. But all around I don't think I'd be making it through this without you guys!!!

I didn't know how to do it (or maybe I thought I did), so I went up and just tied any old knot.  When I was told I was wrong it fel awful, and I've never forgotten it.

I'm a postmodern ironic pedant.    When I see a sign telling me not to walk on the grass, I make sure I choose to run, cartwheel and hop on it instead.    When I see a sign telling me to ring the bell for attention, I ring the bell and do a little dance - you'd be surprised how infrequently they want to pay me any attention!    When I saw a sign in a cafe toilet saying "put only toilet paper down the toilet", i peed in the sink and chucked a whole bog roll down the toilet just to show how much I like to follow the rules, even if it did block the bog.

5MeggG3Laa	probably when i watched a FG episode and started crying idk why i did but it mustve been the music they were playing, yea thats embarrassing|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

ea2ff45699bf70bc0e648830e439c6a1aa	Yes I am. My mother raised me to be a strong, self-sufficient woman. She gave me enough boundaries to keep me safe but enough freedom to make my own decisions.    I work for rich people and the problem I see with the way they raise their kids is they give them things rather than skills. They think they are doing their kids a service by giving them everything they want rather than teaching them the value of hardwork and giving them usable skill sets.     So I'm happy that my mother was able to give me all those skills as a single parent.

9WGB0YCKaa	when you start to realize that you are in denial  you have allready entered back into reality  how you deal with the reality that you have to face,is the difficult part,depending on the person and what exactly they were in denial from in the first place ,i have never been in denial i may have been unobservant a few times,but i try to think ahead before i do anything so everything i do is ok with me properly ,and i remember it fully   its a.good question though|`|AA11932907	your mind is the key to the answer......|`|e7585a7d30f01cc2255dfa437072e3cdaa	Yes.|`|2cc5b6b3e067fca80d88d8898a7b6638aa	yes i do, if not i wont be able to move on|`|1fK77MMhaa	i have a hard time realizing that i'm in denial and tend to keep it like that|`|hDTBjYZWaa	no, sometimes living in denial is better then reality.|`|PFQnIV9laa	Usually I play to the bone.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Kimber and Matt dumped the bomb shells that they were married and that she is pregnant on Shawn and Christian. She wanted her implants removed so she could nurse the baby. Christian agreed to the surgery but he suspected the baby was his. During the surgery he performed an unauthorized amneosynthesis to get a dna sample to prove paternity. The anesthesiologist told him she would tell Kimber. He told Matt. And when the results came back it appears that Matt is the father.    Meanwhile Shawn painted over Marlo's mural for sleeping with Julia. He went to tell him that and to let marlo know that he knew about the affair. Marlo lied to him and told Shawn that he never slept with Julia, but; she later told Shawn that she did just that. They seemed to get hot and heavy right after the confession.    Marvin, the plastic surgeon from season two who nearly cut off Christian's face came to black mail him into doing a rectal surgery on him. Marvin, had just been released from prison for his illegal surgeries and was raped repeatedly. He said his lover  told him about what the boys did in the everglades. It lover was Escobar, the drug dealer who had them remove cocaine from women's breasts. He had one of his men killed in their care and they disposed of the body but he knew where. At any rate Escobar needed surgery too to fix his face. It had been burned off. Christian did the surgery on Marvin first in which Marvin warned him about Kimber. Later the boys were doing the surgery on Escobar when Marvin screwed with the anesthesia. He tried to kill Escobar but Shawn hit him and the guards grabbed him. After the surgery the brother of the dead guy cam e to get Escobar and they killed the guards.     Shawn who had been hallucenating that Escobar was his conscience found himself talking to him in Shawn's house. Escobar was there to tell him that he was free for fixing his face back to what it was. He killed the brother who killed the man in Shawn's office and left him on Shawn's sofa. He also told Shawn he should come clean with Julia about his own affair. Shawn did just that after he called the police to get rid of the body.     EOE    NOTE: In one of the last episodes with escobar he made the boys do a kidney removal. Don't be surprised if Escobar will have something to do with James and her girls before the season is over. He won't take kindly to the Japanese moving in on his territory.|`|a1868e57c5456a0316c5b839a7a24210aa	I missed it too :(|`|AA10644207	Matt married Kimber and she is pregnant.Julia told Sean the truth about her affair.Escobar is back.He set himself on fire in prison and they are working on his face.

31d3a2180284a6a1e5cd406a08872b6baa	I've met ... hmm, lets see ...    I met my best friend online, we talked for 10 years on here and I went to Pennsylvania to meet her before she died. It was the best moment of my life, I loved that girl.    I also met a few people on MySpace from the area of Massachusetts I live in and I hung out with them a few times. They were both nice people.    I've never had a negative meeting up with someone from online experience. You just need to be careful. You need to make sure that you do truly know this person. You need to know what they look like, and webcams help to verify that the pictures they show you are real. Talking to them on the phone is a good thing, too.    People aren't as crazy and psychotic online as this world makes them.|`|Hz5N5J72aa	When I moved to a new city knowing absolutely no one, online was my only way of meeting people.

So thick you can scoop it up with bread.    Dinner - Lamb meat sandwich on toasted bread. No kind of sauce or condiment is needed because the lamb is that delicious.    Dessert - Rice pudding with thick, chewy rice.|`|104c298c569130856f8ea29d45c48c6caa	Can't decide!|`|rnppZZRmaa	French :D|`|4fL1PWwmaa	I've never really had French food, perhaps some bakery items, so I'd be curious for French food, though Greek is always good, except I don't think I'm a very big fan of lamb. and I know its quite popular, and I've never had a Gyro either... hmm...

The Beatles started a huge pop revolution and were very innovative in their time but I think over all that U2 has better songs.  Both have been amazing contributors to the music world!|`|b4a2ae90298c0b35884c9c9d04f1643faa	U2 are more political,but The Beatles wrote better songs and still have a bigger influence on pop culture.|`|AA10297617	shld i really need 2 make a choice, il go w/U2|`|c1715ccffe8d620370086eaf6f2e71f6aa	i love U2~|`|AA12307902	Th Beatles|`|92e0f6a4d78cae045b090fc84057600caa	U2!|`|851fc7c1ef86520e8db1effe977904d3aa	good Q .... I bet most would say The Beatles .... and it is a close one ... But, I believe U2 should have the advantage ... they have been U.N. PeaceKeepers and helper of 3rd world countries in the present as opposed to the past ....    Today is harder times|`|AA11134979	in the 1960s was lennon and mccartney.  now id say bono of u2.|`|AA10998269	What, are you kidding me?  The Beatles by a long, long, long way.    The Beatles are unquestionably (along with the Rolling Stones) one of the greatest bands to ever walk the earth. U2 are quite simply not in the same league as the Beatles.    Do you own any Beatle albums? I f not try to get your hands on some - especially Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. It's fantastic|`|55833baa318dbad677efdb3bbd677ccfaa	The Beatles and U2 have both brought uniqueness and originality to the music scene. No one will ever be bigger than The Beatles. But if there's anyone today that could be compared to them, it's U2.   U2 has led some of the best tours ever in rock (Zoo TV, the slightly less successful but extremely inventive PopMart, Elevation and Vertigo tours). U2's songs also have a weight that The Beatles songs don't have.  If you're measuring pure musicianship, you have to go with The Beatles.   U2's blueprint for music is: whatever kinda music they are listening to, they will write a song in that genre and will still have the U2 "feel" in it. They've written rock, punk, country, techno, jazz, etc...but they've done it in a way that didn't completely abandon their original sound. There were simply never be another U2.   Even though The Beatles are legendary, I say U2 takes the cake. Plus U2 has stayed together longer. The same four members for over 20 years and they've only gotten better. That is unheard of.|`|8cf073c8d02a950808d1b0b9467e41cfaa	U2 - they've been around longer as a band

EaNmD5Araa	i like em..|`|4vcU4fgAaa	I just met a band that loves AC/DC and Motley Crue.  I thought it was kind of strange for them to be so die-hard about 80's rock because they're between the ages of 14-17.  So, there are some other rockers out there your age.|`|c917fa3d9fd16ed1109180c721d90f90aa	I don't really know a lot of their songs, but they are good.

AA11113578	I wouldn't try to read too much into it, that was a nasty time when everyoone tried so hard and so obviously to be "refined," "spiritual," "smart" and "witty" that in those futile attempts some of the most attrocious, disastrous and hilarious lyrics & titles were conceived. Some of the examples would be the pompous, pretentious, preposterous and, of course, imabcile and shallow lyrics of King Crimson (Pete Sinfield should be in prison, but Belew continued the horrifying tradition), ELP (Tarkus... good god, what a pile of excrement), Genesis (Babriel was witty enough to always sway it into sarcasm, irony, and such, but still... pop songs about Narcissus... holy cow) and of course the darkest recesses of barely human thought, filled with the unbearable stench of abolsute drug-induced retardation, Yes and their faraway worlds and wonderous stories and Tormato... so The Moody Blues were much like that, and trying to compete in such a world. That title, silly as it is, still sounds WAY smarter than the T-Rex's hall of shame candidate "My people were fair and had sky on their hair, but now they're content to wear stars on their brow." Now, I know all of that, but to my defense, I was 13 and then up until 17 when I listened to all that junk AND my English was very rudimentary back then - I am not a native speaker. Discovering Styx, I got to the point of understanding enough of all that crap and I dumped most of those records in trash (some instrumentals are still on my playlists, though). There was ona bright star in that era, though - Pink Floyd. Not fantastic, but compared to the contemporaries, an oasis of wisdom in the desert of tastelessness.|`|AA11957106	Sorry!  I have never questioned the Moody Blues logic.  I just really,really, really enjoy their music.]  Days of Future Passed is one of the very best LP's ever.|`|a415365b6ce17fed94d67c3ac4abd81faa	Too old for me.

b5326a736dc72398379e2e96b682c555aa	I think the husband and wife references just harken back to traditional joke fodder.  I think when the concept of a joke was developing it was in a day when people got married more.  So, I suppose it comes out of tradition, but also, perhaps since in society, a married bond is considered a truer, stronger bond, it lends more to the humor of the joke, at least to some people.

AA11159468	I remember the Abba version:  great song!     Chiquitita, tell me whats wrong  Youre enchained by your own sorrow  In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  How I hate to see you like this  There is no way you can deny it  I can see that youre oh so sad, so quiet    Chiquitita, tell me the truth  Im a shoulder you can cry on  Your best friend, Im the one you must rely on  You were always sure of yourself  Now I see youve broken a feather  I hope we can patch it up together    Chiquitita, you and I know  How the heartaches come and they go and the scars theyre leaving  Youll be dancing once again and the pain will end  You will have no time for grieving  Chiquitita, you and I cry  But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  Sing a new song, chiquitita  Try once more like you did before  Sing a new song, chiquitita    So the walls came tumbling down  And your loves a blown out candle  All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  Chiquitita, tell me the truth  There is no way you can deny it  I see that youre oh so sad, so quiet    Chiquitita, you and I know  How the heartaches come and they go and the scars theyre leaving  Youll be dancing once again and the pain will end  You will have no time for grieving  Chiquitita, you and I cry  But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  Sing a new song, chiquitita  Try once more like you did before  Sing a new song, chiquitita  Try once more like you did before  Sing a new song, chiquitita

1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	There are so many pros to having a pet. They are so much company, give you unconditional love, they're funny and entertaining, always happy to see you no matter what mood you're in and they are very forgiving. I have 2 dogs and they are our children. They don't even think they're dogs, they act more like children. The only cons would be having to have someone to take care of them when you travel or take a vacation, housebreaking is a bit of a challenge and really that's the only bad thing. I can't imagine not having my dogs in my life. they are such great companions and always cheer me up after a bad day.|`|9d0f728b3338ed9ffccbf02630a332c3aa	that can vary depending on the type of pet.

EVERY friend and family member who has taken this advice, hardly ever gets sick.    For your throat: "Peaceful Mountain--Throat Rescue"  You will NEVER find a more powerful throat spray which is all-natural....soothing, fast acting, and kills bad bacteria on contact.

AA12302661	I think there really is a terror threat. It seems that Al Qaeda has plans. They already caused some uproar in the United Kingdom, where i live. I have seen some things changing here. The high way spaghetti junction which goes south and goes north had police there. They had so in case someone would try and bomb that junction. If that junction goes, no one can travel around. We seriously do have to watch out no matter where we are. It seems that these people who want to harm others are among us. I don't think Bush just wants to change the focus of his low ratings, i think he wants to save people's lives. Al Qaeda warns us all the time, it's nice to say that they are bluffing, but September 11 tells it all, we can't take whatever they are saying as a joke, we have to be careful and watch no matter where we are.    And even if we went after Osama Bin Laden, do you think all of this would have been avoided? I don't think so at all. We can get rid of one man, but there are too many like him out there who is willing to just harm people in the western society.|`|AA10102392	I believe there really is a terror threat. If we had concentrated our resources on the war in Afghanistan, we would have made it harder for Al Qaeda to regroup and strenghten. Maybe we would have captured bin Laden too, but instead, we went after Saddam.

3db332425694490a72f67bd5a83990d6aa	You'll need a hardware interface that takes the plug from your guitar and uses your PC's USB port.  I personally use the TonePort... it's pretty easy to use, and comes with a LOT of models that you can use to get the sound you want.      Then you'll need recording/sound editing software.  I use Audacity... it's free, and easy to use.  There are more powerful software packages out there (like Cakewalk or Audition), but you'll have to pay...|`|d2b2d9481308538f7afe624b87d86d0eaa	I'm a guitarist too, but I don't really record my music.

Sounds like someone's trying to give reason to like the politically correct music chosen by our government.  There are plenty of better Christian songs.  Flyleaf is ten times better than the Jonas Brothers.    I think No One Knows by the Queens of the Stone Age was written about you...  No, wait, Letterbomb by Green Day was.  Or maybe Violent Pornography(not about violent porn...) by System of a Down.  It's oblivious teenagers like you that make America seem dumb to all other countries, not George Bush.

(I'm not saying ALL people)!  Plus they have released new songs and albums right now, that's why everybody likes em.|`|RY7jOHTJaa	Woah, alrightalright. The Jonas Brothers are the hottest thing in the world right now. Everyone likes their music and their attitudes. The Jonas Brothers aren't your usual teenage Hollywood stars out there. They support many causes and help with them too. They also give some of their time to the fans by having free concerts, giving away many things, and way way more. Since they were raised in an all Catholic family and raised by two loving parents that support everything they do, the Jonas Brothers are not what you call egotistical. The big deal about them is that they're cute, around our ages, and the hottest thing in the world. As a band starting out in their New Jersey home, they've expanded out, and turned out to be something that everyone wants to be like. Many people may be jealous of them, but if you learn about them, you'll think way different. Hmmm, I hope that helps! :D|`|A34razphaa	what song did u listine too. anyways girls like them because lets see there on there burnin up tour, they just played in camp rock n ther every teen girls fantasy hmmmhh idk you tell me. you wouldnt understand your a guy.

4737dab527209296cddace0d73d42a5daa	He's Gone   Lyrics: Robert Hunter  Music: Jerry Garcia      Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb  You know better, but I know him    Like I told you, like I said  Steal your face right off your head    Chorus  And now he's gone  Now he's gone, Lord he's gone  He's gone  Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track  He's gone, gone, and nothing's gonna bring him back  He's gone    Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride  Hot as a pistol but cool inside    Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile  Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile    [chorus]    Going where the wind don't blow so strange  Maybe off on some high cold mountain range (note 1)  Lost one round but the price wasn't anything  A knife in the back and more of the same    Same old  Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb  You know better, but I know him    Like I told you, like I said  Steal your face right off your head    [chorus]    Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back  Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back  Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back  [etc]    Notes  (1) the Hunter lyrics are "... mountain range" but it certainly sounds as if the Dead sing "... mountain chain." For what it's worth, it's "chain" in the sheet music in the Grateful Dead Anthology Vol 1.  (2) Hunter's manuscript includes some verses that never made it into the final version:   So long baby, rip it up today  Write me a letter when you mend your ways    Hanging on a meat hook, coolin' my heels  Sign no papers and make no deals    Take me to the kickshop, hang me up for poor  Just try to see you don't shame me no more

If someone says they don't want a baby and then they get pregnant, it's their fault they should have used protection and so they should have the baby. Abortion is horrible.

Why should anyone tell her what she can and can't do with her body?    Yeah she could always put the baby up for adoption, but there's thousands of kids out there living on the streets already.  Why don't people adopt those kids??    People should seriously mind their own business and stop trying to meddle in other people's lives and choices.    Besides, if abortion is outlawed, then women are going to start trying to give themselves abortions with hangers and all that stuff.  Would you prefer that?|`|kAIXDVu1aa	i'm soo against it i mean seriously who wants to see a baby still in the womb die... and it dosen't deserve that|`|aitD50yuaa	I totally agree with the second answer, she sounds so right I think if someone gets raped, and they don't want or not ready to have kids they should if just someone wants to do it cause they laid around, it's wrong, That sounds more right I just agree with that....|`|1iKZaaNgaa	Well I'm kind of for it but kind of not because I think that rape victims should have every right to not have the child  but when  it comes to the ignorant people  who want to kill their child because its a girl ,I feel that it shouldn't be allowed. And those idiots who sleep around and get pregnant, their child shouldn't be punished.  So I think in order to have an abortion there should be certain circumstances but I know that it'll never work.|`|K4PzwkDjaa	i'm totally anti-abortion.  i believe its murder.  but obama is not for it. he just said he wont make a law against it, because its none of his business.|`|nk1TOL5Oaa	for it...|`|yJQzjjkvaa	i think it is wrong, because it is murder, im not saying it is wrong just becasue of my religion. The child in the womb is a human and is alive, so it should count as murder. Thats the only thing i disagree on with Obama, but he is trying to make everyone happy, we just have to rely on what people see as right and wrong.|`|nnwjRGAhaa	i am so against it... if you open your legs you know the consequences|`|KN9icVNRaa	I think that a fetus is a potential human being, not one yet. If someone screwed up then they screwed up; whatever happened to second chances? So next time they wll learn to use pills and condoms, it isn't like they are heartless people, they will probably feel bad about it. If they get an abortion, the either don't wan't a child or know they can't take care of it, so even if they didn't get an abortion, the kid wouldn't be very well off.|`|6zLluVp0aa	BEEP_BEEP. MORTAL SIIIN!     First of all, its grave. Second, you did it deliberately. Third, its with full knowledge. Even the use of contraceptives. With abortion, you murder. Even if its blood. Blood is life. And with murder, you steal. You steal one's right to live. Only God can take lives. And, you did PMS. Which is GRAVE. Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. So lets use it for uprightness.

28803a05aa81d54cb36f2a0a443c5cf7aa	I live in Mexico, so I saw it last month. Guillermo Del Toro is Mexican, but the movie its a Spanish production. I loved this film, I think its the best of the year (of the ones I saw), it has already won four awards for best movie in foreign language, it's nominated for the golden globes and the Goyas (Spanish Oscars). The actors are great, the music it's beautiful, the story it's perfect, the visual effects are astonishing, the photography rules, well, I better let you form your opinion. By the way, although it's a fairy tail, it's not for kids.|`|9c6681e9c0a8978af201b74601f8d50aaa	I saw and loved it. It should be out in the US within the next month.  Great fantasy story, with some amazing characters.  One thing people may not know, is that it is in Spanish with subtitles.    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/|`|AA11224073	I saw a sneak preview of it a few weeks ago- it's excellent.  It's a Mexican film so it's Spanish with English subtitles.  very good film with a lot of imaginitive creatures, etc.  It's basically about a little girl with a vivid imaginiation which she uses to combat lonliness and the Fascism of the times.  She falls in love with a fawn in a ruined labyrinth near her home.  it's kind of creepy at times but the cinematography is amazing.    A good film worth seeing, especailly if you enjoy foreign films.
04830ff9addfcfcf0bb3b7ad697c8b42aa	I feel that Barbara is more like the Principal now then anything else. If anyone says anything out of line she tries to real them in fast. I agreed with Rosie that this show is called the View and they are giving their View points. If Barbara doesn't want them to give them opinion then she should give them the guidelines of what they should talk about before each show. I don't care for the way Barbara is acting these days and the show is more relaxed when she's not there. Maybe Barbara needs to get some to relax more because she's pretty tense these days and it's shows to those of us who watch the show.|`|AA11957106	C'mon! Rosie wouldn' hit or pull hair.

NJaZBgDwaa	An art song is a classical song that is NOT from opera or oratorio. This includes German Lieder.    No offense but it doesnt sound as if you are a classical singer, so I really wouldnt sing that. If you do, I would probably go for Lieder, as it is (usually) vocally easier, than some of the Italian and French art songs. good songs for an alto is "Ich Bin der Welt abhanden Gekommen," by Mahler or "Erlkonig" by schubert.    But I really dont reccomend doing art songs if you dont sing classically.    As for folk songs... anything could be counted as a folk song. Just google folk songs, heaps of things will come up.  As a recommendation, my fav folk song is "Blow the Wind Southerly"  It is English, and not hard to find the music for (for free) on the Internet. Here is a link to hear it:  http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=LF7ibuEpx5...|`|yYAabiSLaa	I agree with misslimlam. If you are not a classically trained singer, you should probably avoid the challenge classical music for the moment, and either stick with the easier stuff or consider training. (However, I'm not sure I agree insofar as to say German leider is vocally easier... though  I suppose this an opinion thing.  )    This all said, you might try the works of Libby Larsen. http://libbylarsen.com/index.php?content...    I've known many amateur singers that have had success with her art songs.    Also, THANKYOU for mentioning your voice type.    Good luck!      EDIT: Actually, are you permitted to do cabaret songs ? If so, try " Amor" from  William Bolcom's "Cabaret Songs". The piece itself is quite musical theater-ey, and it sits in a comfy middle range, with a bit of exploration of the higher and lower register.

If he threw the first punch and she was unarmed,  well, let's just say this is his butthole now: * this is what it's gonna look like it 11   months: O when he gets out of jail.    4.

eEwKMwGBaa	No puedo hablar por uruguayos, peruanos, bolivianos, dominicanos, argentinos, venezolanos, espa?oles, etc.    Pero s por los mexicanos, en mi pas no es complicado hallar ese cuadro pintoresco, estrafalario, de la familia, cuando asiste a un evento, al mexicano le gusta hacerse presente y si el evento es gratuito, no slo le gusta hacerse presente, se siente obligado, aunque despus se arrepienta. Me parece que esta observacin no es ofensiva, es algo que nos caracteriza de forma general, y me parece un poco gracioso cuando la gente quiere santificar a su pueblo, slo porque es su pueblo, o cuando delimita y alude como renegados a unos cuantos y se extra?a con preguntas como: ?Pues dnde vives? ?De qu barrio eres?. En teora somos solidarios, puros, amables, impecables, competentes, centrados, respetuosos, bla, bla, bla, demasiado: bla, bla, bla, desde mi punto de vista.|`|y418RCYpaa	Soy mexicana, y a mi me mueve la palabra calidad, y la relacin precio beneficio, si eres mexicano, no se donde vivas y con que clase de gente andes, y si eres extranjeros que pesimo concepto tienes, y en todos los paises hay de todo.|`|67ga8tMKaa	por suerte soy chilena!|`|HGUhfjZpaa	jajajaja pss para muchos podria ser  para mi nop  salu2!!|`|5DJnGhDyaa	Le atinaste al clavo (pero no a todos, a algunos como en todos los paises)|`|64NuGxwwaa	no es cierto... la plabra ke a los MEXICANOS nos mata es CERVEZA... no nos importa ke no sea gratis, de hecho si es barata si es bueno xq compramos mas pero muchos nos hemos kedado sin dinero toda la semana solo por tomar excesivamente los fines de semana|`|0V36PSvvaa	jaja es chistoso.

Muchos mexicanos sabemos tambien que lo que se anuncia como gratis o como barato en realidad puede resultarte muy caro (en tiempo perdido y en dinero tambin). Muchos mexicanos sabemos tambin que en esta vida nada es gratuito y que todo lo que aparezca con esa etiqueta, seguramente trae consigo una doble intencin.

Ho9VGCmuaa	You want to go with something that is not frustrating for the beginner - that is the most important thing, starting out    - the harmonica is small, but it has lots of things to learn on it, most of which you can't see what's happening because it is under your nose when you play.      On the page referenced below you probably want to go with the Madcat DVD.  You'll also notice that you can go in Celtic directions, Blues, Bluegrass, Jazz - all those styles of music are represented as harmonica instruction, and all are great in their own way.    But, build your basic harmonica technique first, and then you can go in whatever direction you want!

No era mi intencin, mis intenciones eran buenas   En toda mi carrera nunca les he mencionado   Ahora es una falta de respeto por no hablar   Y hablar de algo de lo que no conoca nada   Adems Dre me dijo que me mantuviera al margen, que esa no era mi lucha   As lo hice, me contuve, mir y apret los dientes   Mientras ellos hablan mal de una persona que literalmente me salv la vida   Claro que entiendo que esto es un negocio   Y esta mierda no es asunto mo   Pero todava se que esto puede explotar en cualquier momento porque...

Es un juego diferente, soltando nombres y no rapeando   Tratamos de parar la pelea entre 50 y Ja   Yo y Dre nos sentamos con l y le advertimos   Y le pedimos que no empezara, l no iba a ir a por l   Hasta que Ja empez a presumir en las revistas de como le apu?al   Jdele 50, machcalo y dale lo que se merece   Mientras tanto mi atencin va en otras direcciones   Algn recepcionista de The Source que responde a los telfonos en su mesa   Tiene una ereccin pensando en m y piensa que soy su resurreccin   Trata de quitar el polvo a su micro y hace un nuevo disco   Pero ahora se ha jodido porque uno de los modos por los que vine   Fu a travs de esa revista, la misma que me hizo famoso   Ahora el propietario de la revista tiene algo contra m por nada?   Pues bien, que se joda, se la puede meter por donde le quepa   Estoy tan cabreado con tanta mierda que no me paro a pensar   Que hemos revivido la pelea de 50 con el sello Murder Inc.   l ha heredado todo lo mo, y nos la trae floja   Todava tenemos soldados en primera lnea   Dispuesta a morir por nosotros en cuanto les demos la orden   Sin tener que extorsionarles para que demuestren que no apoyan   Puede que les nombremos en una cancin o un estribillo   Para demostrarles que le queremos y hacerles saber lo importante que es   tener el control, soldados en nuestras esquinas   Su lealtad a nosotros vale ms que ningn premio   Pero no queremos que ninguno de los nuestros acabe herido y muerto   No merece la pena, no puedo pensar en otra manera de decirlo mejor   Que decir que les quiero a todos demasiado para ver el veredicto   Lo dejar todo antes de que vaya a mayores   Pero no lo entendis mal, no me estoy poniendo de rodillas   Slo pretendo crecer como persona   Si me dejis de molestar y hablar de m   Porque francamente estoy cansado de hablar   No voy a dear que el atad de otra persona pese sobre mi conciencia porque...

Or would you be ready to go before the break starts?|`|fcEqR3yFaa	No, as this would come under the heading of sexual harassment if implemented.  Besides, sexual release also has a tendency of making some people more tired, and this can actually reduce productivity.  And if people are calling in or showing up late for these activities, it would reflect badly for the company in the marketplace.|`|AA10106002	Yeah. that'd cure all the problems at the work place and in the world.

zUFdTyqZaa	Your boss is just damn jealous he ain't gettin' any.|`|MtjR6yT2aa	Ageism|`|cZHsma8Jaa	What answer are you looking for? I mean, there are company policies about having sexual relationships with colleagues. What if the person you were with claimed sexual harassment charges against you to the  company (even if she did consent to it, she could be freaking crazy) and then what would the company do then? They would have to deal with a sexual harassment law suit. Your company is not discrimiating against you but looking out for themselves.     I know every company I have worked with has restriced office relationships but they say "what you do in your own time, is your own business, just do not bring it to work".     They have always restriced, what we call in the US, PDA (public displays of affection) like for example during work, you and a colleague make out in the break room, because for one, it is nasty (no one wants to see that), and two, it is unprofessional.  And like the others said, you can not compare two children who were curious about what was down there, to the actions of two adults.. it is just different.     Another point, it seems like you two may have been seen by someone and it probably offended them... some people are prude and honestly, do you want to see two people getting it on in the copy machine room?|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	You cannot compare Adults actions to little children.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Hola mi amiga...!           No lo creo que sea as. De hecho los grandes lideres religiosos son invariablemente gente muy preparada en muchos ambitos y todo su sequito lo es tambien. En cuanto a los feligreses puede destacarse que si es muy notoria la falta de cultura, pero no es el grueso de los mismos.   Recuerda que la religion es cuestion de f y solo de f, as que por ello podras encontrar a miles y miles de feligreses de cualquier religin, culto o secta con miles de conocimientos o sin ellos y a todos los veras arrodillados.    F y solo f, recuerdas la frase de Karl Marx?  "La religin   es el opio del pueblo"    Bueno... eso digo yo!|`|5XmxV9gLaa	seguro que no, ya que hay fanaticos de todas las religiones tanto entre los analfabetos, como entre los que se llaman "cultos"...|`|c40f0f83394972d1728fe4eb26d94092aa	El fanatismo no solo el religioso, cualquier tipo de fundamentalismo, es proporcional al grado de ignorancia.

d273b124fa210bc992f40793eddaf3e6aa	Krystal had a fork, spoon, or whatever in her hand when they first started fighting. Somehow she picked up a shoe with a tall *** heel and used that, too. I don't know which one did the damage to Vanessa's face, but in my opinion Vanessa won. I'm sure if Vanessa used some object to beat Krystal's a** she would've been bloody, too. If it was a fair fight, Vanessa would definitely have won, cuz she was workin' Krystal. I think Krystal should go home since all she does is complain about how much she doesn't like what VI has to offer. But, Vanessa attacked, so she will probably go home. Tsk tsk.    I don't take sides, I think Vanessa is wrong for wanting to take it that far, but people that are on Krystal's side mesmerize me. She needs to learn respect. In the end, what they fought over was petty.|`|819c9b150e0bfed8fc5deb31a2eae7dcaa	i hate krystal. she's high-class. vannessa is the one that run thing cuz she from the vi. vanessa did beat up krystal becuz krystal ended up in the hospital. the only reason vanessa face was bleading is because krystal had something in her hand to hit vannessa with. krystal fight with items and vanessa fight with her fists, so get yo facts straight. why do you tink vanessa gonna get kick off the show. she didn't even throw first knock.|`|126683becd338006d08278c1892427f0aa	Actually I think Vanessa got the best of Krystal.

D8sN8gNFaa	Because of jealousy, or failure in their own lives, so they seek to take someone else down to their level of failure. This happened to my dad once, he was a star athlete at his school, and he competed against this other guy who had some issues in his life, and when my dad won, received the gold medal, and a picture in the newspaper the next day, everyone at school congratulated him, the guy who lost took it way too personally, and hated to be seen as second best, so a couple years later he ended up hunting my dad down, and became roomates with him. My dad was unaware that the guy was going through his things, stealing his mail, and saying bad stuff about him to his friends.

XRX2sgniaa	The use of the blue note. The African culture's music was based on the quarter tone scale versus the half tone chromatic scale that Western music uses. As a result, in jazz, the use of the seventh or ninth started being used to colour the music to best compare it to the old African scales. Jazz was made popular being played in the red light districts where sailors would come to port. Scatting, call and response, and improvised solos were all traits, but probably the most African properties of jazz was the syncopated rhythm and the blue notes.|`|MoKUZuQraa	the ability to use jazz to express emotions|`|TZz1uPY2aa	Call and Response.

AA10102392	There were several ghosts. You are thinking of the young girl who came to him. She was poisoned by her mother, and the mother was doing the same thing to her younger sister. She haunted the boy so that he would give the videotape she made to her father, so he would know the truth. (The tape showed the mother putting poison in the girl's food)    The premise is that the ghosts could not rest because they had unfinished business and they would attempt to communicate with people who could see them.|`|ee7b4508c5f4d59cc119fd0c3e945b93aa	The ghosts haunted the boy in a nice way -- they all wanted him to contact their loved ones to deliver some sort of message that was important, i.e. that the mom was slowly killing her 2nd daughter just like she had with the first.  Once these requests are fulfilled, the ghosts can finally rest in peace.  The way I remember the ending is that Bruce Willis realizes he's dead!!|`|ci64gIZ8aa	They have messages, or try watch THE MESSENGER ( Kirsten Stewart)|`|Cm1H9Jqaaa	i think they just wanted his help|`|IfhEMREcaa	the girl that wants him to deliver to box was basically murdered by her mom/stepmom and the girl had a videotape of it so she put it in the box and wanted the little boy to give it to her dad to see.|`|5d93feba60a6599e3f77941fe4be59d6aa	The little girl who died and he was at the wake, her mother had poisoned her with pine sol or something in her food. The little girl had a video camera hid in her room and it showed her mother doing it. So she told him and he told her father and they played the tape and saw the Mom poisoning her !!!!!

KwXAUn6Xaa	Interesting, I love too love sport, art and music and I'm headed for a Legal career: it's all about personal interests I guess.    A great place to start is www.fasttomato.co.uk, although I don't know if you are a UK user. If you are it's fantastic, if not, I'm sure there are overseas versions of websites that provide careers and education guidance.     Finally, depending on how old you are, you may not need to know what you want to do with your life. Many people change their mind several times during their lives at every age.     If you are, say, under 16, you should just carry on with subjects you enjoy, and you may develop an interest in a particular career/field.    Good luck.

rpZ12Rt6aa	I don't think anything quite parallels it.  But then again, all music is not created equally.  You should definitely check out Debussy's Prelude on the Afternoon of a Faun.  It's quite a haunting melody with a great flute solo.  Chopin Ballade No. 3 in A minor is quite good too!  I was actually learning this piece a while ago.  Papillons by Robert Schumann is another good one that I was learning.   It's in a set of several variations that describe butterflies.  Ondine from Gaspard de la Nuit by Ravel starts eerily but becomes a beautiful and delicate piece full of color.  It's amazing.  Then some more modern music: Yiruma is a great pianist today that does really beautiful touching pieces. My favorite is Kiss the Rain.  See below for links and enjoy!|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Yeah, Gabriel Faur's song (yes, song) by the same title.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mjy3Fw5G...|`|AA10248966	Adagio by Albinoni    Bach: Air on the D String    Second movement of Mozart's piano concerto in C major|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Yes there are hundreds, including many by Debussy himself.  If Debussy is your bag - try Satie, Ravel and perhaps Poulenc.|`|170GrvE0aa	Have you looked at Debussy's other pieces?

Click on the following link for a complete list of Debussy's solo piano pieces:-    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_com...|`|PoTwN4mmaa	I really don't like questions like this since one must go beyond the realm of the popular classical pieces and find them themselves. This is what I do:     1. Go onto wikipedia, type in "list of compositions  of (composer name)" and look at all their music.   2. For instance Debussy, then youtube the name of that debussy song  3. If its on youtube, (which it most likely is) download a youtube downloader(just google it) for free  4. Download the piece.      I urge you to look into all these pieces I suggest...some are a bit overlooked     Debussy violin sonata:     Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSqMpr-mB...     Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xycUGEJO...    Part 3:     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJKp70J-O...      Another one: Rachmaninoff prelude op 32 no.10-    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxFI2cphu...    Scriabin piano sonata no. 5:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0lfk2QgP...

Rachmaninoff etude no.8 op 39    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hZaEcgWo...      Scriabin etude op.8 no.12-    Just youtube it since I cannot put a link(I have to many, Y answers won't allow)      Scriabin etude op42 no.5-  Youtube search it(try the one by kissin)    Rachmaninoff etude op.5 no. 39-  Youtube it, I suggest the horowitz version      EDIT:    To person below me...these rachmaninoff and scriabin pieces are more beautiful than you think...you probably did not click on the links...whenever a question like this is asked you always get one who says the same boring answer: moonlight sonata. (first movement)      Like I say, one must venture beyond the realm of Beethoven  Mozart, Chopin, and Debussy's Clair de lune to get the full classical music experience. I can't tell you how many times I hear the answer: "moonlight sonata"(though It is a good piece)  its just overplayed, there are piano pieces at the same difficulty level and just as pretty sounding as that Beethoven.       Like I said, the pieces I suggested are very overlooked...      EDIT 2:    To the person below, that's great that you played the scriabin major works. I myself am working on his 9th piano sonata.  I find it a bit weird you don't find his 5th sonata beautiful...maybe its just my taste.  Okay maybe his etude op8 is not as great to listen to to go to sleep but I certainly think sonata  5 is. Considering I've listened to it going to sleep lol. Especially the beautiful mood Scriabin creates after the first page. (before the presto in 6/8 time)  What I define as not beautiful is something like bartok's piano sonata.   Beethoven's 23rd  sonata(2nd mov.) is also good too|`|WVLNcDXBaa	If you listen Clair de lune to fall asleep, I will recommend you Chopin- Nocturne op 9 no 2. Or Liszt- Reve d'amour no 3. Or Beethoven- Moonlight Sonata (the first part). There are hundreds of wonderful pieces but these are my favorite slow pieces. I don't think you are going to be relaxed while listening Rachmaninoff, or Scriabin, etc.  Cheers!      EDIT:  The person before me: I've played all Scriabin piano sonatas and studies. I don't need to look on youtube to listen them. So, my musical culture is not limited just at Moonlight Sonata. But I think you can't sleep while you listen Scriabin's op 8 no 12, for example. I know that I couldn't. All the best!  PS: Your Debussy's Arabesque no 1 sounds pretty cool! Good luck!

Nr4dOPWWaa	There was once a little boy sitting in the class when the teacher asked him a question, "Where is Norway?". The boy replied, "I don't know". The teacher exclaimed with surprise, "You dont know where is Norway??????????? Get out of my class".    The boy left the class and while he was standing outside, the head teacher was on the round. She asked the boy, "Why are you standing here and not attending the class". The boy told her that his teacher asked him to leave the class because he didnt know where is Norway. The Head teacher went mad on that boy and said,"You dont know where Norway is???????? You are a disgrace to the school". She now took the kid to the Principal.    The principal now asked the student gently, "Why are you so upset and what have you done?". The boy replied, "They are all hating me because I dont know where is Norway". The principal couldnt believe what he heard and yelled at the boy, "Whatttttttt??? You dont know where Norway is. I just cannot believe it. If you dont know where is Norway, what the hell do you know about this world". The principal expelled the student from the school.    The boy had no other option than going home. He went home thinking why this was such a big deal to know where Norway was. When he reached home, his mother looked at his face. He was looking so much disappointed and upset. The mother asked him, "What happened to you and why are you home so early. Is everything ok???". The boy replied, "They expelled me from the school just because I dont know where Norway is". The mother looked at him with great anger and said, "You dont deserve to be called my son because you cannot even answer such a simple question. Get out of my house and never show me your face again"    The boy left home crying. He felt as if the whole world hated him. While he was walking down a street, a police officer stopped him and asked, "hey kiddie!!! why are you crying. why dont you go home???". The boy replied, "my mother has kicked me out of the house and ask me never to come back". The officer was surprised to hear that so he asked, "why would your mother do such a terrible thing???". The boy said, "Because I dont know where is Norway". The police officer had his face turned red knowing the reason. He said to the boy, "how can you not know where Norway is???? You are such an idiot and has no right to live in this country". The officer put him on a ship to make sure that the boy leaves the country.    The ship departed and the boy could not stop crying. The captain of the ship was informed that there is a boy who is crying and passengers could not find his family. The captain called the boy and asked him what was wrong. The boy replied, "No body likes me because I dont know where is Norway". The captain of the ship went mad at him. He said, "I just cannot believe this. Everybody except you knows where is Norway. You simply do not have the right to live". The captain threw him in the water.    The boy did not know how to swim so he started shouting for help. Luckily, there was a helicopter flying just over the place where he was sinking. Passengers on the helicopter managed to pull the boy out of the water and asked him about how he ended up sinking in the water. The boy replied, "This is because I dont know where is Norway". Those people who just saved him were stunned by the answer. They said, "If you dont know where is Norway, you better leave the helicopter". They gave him a parachute and threw him out of the flying helicopter.    The boy landed safe with the help of the parachute. A few days passed by and he was rejected by everyone whom he trusted to tell his story.    One day he reached the border of a country. It was an open border. There was a big road and on the other saide of the read there was a welcome board saying, "Welcome To Norway". The boy was so glad to find out where the Norway was. He thought that he would take the welcome notice off the board, go back to his country and show it to everybody. He thought that this was the best way to surprise all the people who rejected him. To implement the plan, he tried to cross the road. He was too excited not to notice that there was a truck travelling at 80 miles per hour, that just ran over the poor boy. The boy died right over there.    Now like every other story, this story has a moral. What is that moral??????                                      Think hard, you will get it                                                                                  The moral is....................                                                    "Cross the road carefully".

vsy4QMHMaa	The e minor key signature seems to be your problem. You've got to carry the F s all the way through. It would be best if you got a piano teacher to lead you through a structured approach to learning. You'll find it much faster, and less frustrating than "winging it"     Here's a copy with the proper note names written below the melody.    http://s281.photobucket.com/albums/kk206...    ... and no, I'm not going to do Eine kleine Nachtmusik, Carol of the Bells or Charlie Brown's theme music ... I spent way too much time on this one already.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	You wrote in the right notes, but you are not taking the key signature into account.  Right at the beginning of each line, you will see a "sharp" symbol:       That sharp is on the line for F, so that means that all F's are to be played as F  unless otherwise noted with a "natural" symbol, although there are no "naturals" in this music which you have here.  This concept is known as a "key signature".  Don't give up on reading music.  You have the right notes.  There is simply more to reading music than just knowing the notes.  Keep it up, and I'm sure you will do well.    On another little side note, there are typically two different ways to play Greensleeves.  The music that you have is the original way, but it is not as well known.  Most people, when they sing or play Greensleeves, do not play the high C . They play it as a regular high C.  So that, coupled with the fact that you aren't playing the F  is probably why it sounds very weird to you.    Here, I made you a little video on youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uhDvZ6lw...  (Sorry it's so quiet!)|`|T8B23z2Yaa	e,g,b,d,f  and spaces spell faces. haha|`|VD3M8izdaa	Have you tried    http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how%20to%20read%20s...|`|FXTGvGHhaa	Are you starting on the right note?

AA11159468	Here they are.   I've pasted the list below from the website cited.    You're right that the key of the first three symphonies is   not often given.      In fact the Sea Symphony is in D major [even though it opens with a brass chord of B flat minor!]     The London Symphony is in G major.    The Pastoral is also in G;  but definitions are more difficult in that this is commonly a G with a flat seventh, and so is properly in the myxolydian mode rather than in a straightfowardly diatonic G major.     This is a characteristic feature of RVW's music,  traceable to English folk song.    He doesn't give a key signature at the opening.   You could try comparing it with the opening of Sibelius 6 [which is also modal,  in a dorian D.]     I expect wikipedia has something useful about modes and key structures.      The key of Sinfonia Antartica is hard to define,  especially without a full score in fornt of me.  The opening melody rises through Eflat F G A B C D E F   and again, no key signature is given.   Michael Kennedy's book The Works of RVW doesn't seem to state what key he thinks it's in either.   There is a sense of a tonal centre,  but it's fairly fluid.              However,  here is a relatively clear list from agentsmith:     Symphony no.1 "A Sea Symphony" (1903 - 9)   Symphony no.2 "A London Symphony" (1912 - 3)  Symphony no.3 "A Pastoral Symphony" (1918 - 21)   Symphony no.4 in F minor (1931 - 4)   Symphony no.5 in D (1938 - 43)   Symphony no.6 in E minor (1944 - 7)   Symphony no.7 "Sinfonia Antartica" (1949 - 52)   Symphony no.8 in D minor (1953 - 5)   Symphony no.9 in E minor (1956 - 7)
STJT3PB3aa	Level 4 sounds about right. Kabalevsky did several different variations but many can be found in the level 4 Russian music school books. I don't know the Clementi valse but most of his material is early intermediate to late intermediate. As for Wild Horseman, it can be found in Schumann's Album for the Young and the pieces in that book are anywhere from level 3 to level 6.    There are 10 levels in all including an extra level called ARCT. A level 10 piece would be Rachmaninoff Prelude in g-minor, or Lizst Hungarian Rhapsody. It's not always easy to determine exactly what level a student is which may be why your teacher didn't tell you. Standards are different depending on where you are studying piano. For example I've seen a level 2 Kabalevsky piece in the level 4 Faber lesson book.     It sounds like you are making great progress in your piano studies. Keep it UP :))|`|AA10248966	2-3|`|BcfDJS7raa	Your at Grade 4. Grade 10 is the highest grade then it breaks off to be performer or teacher level which is called ARCT.

De acuerdo a la escala de electronegatividades de Pauling, el Hidrgeno es asignado al valor 2,10 y en esta escala el valor relativo correspondiente a Oxgeno es 3,50, existiendo en consecuencia una diferencia de electronegatividades de 1,40. Esta diferencia en valores de electronegatividad es una clara indicacin de la existencia de polaridad en la molcula de agua. De esta forma, vemos que a nivel de cargas elctricas sobre los diversos ncleos de esta molcula, debe existir una carga residual sobre Oxgeno negativa y sobre los Hidrgenos positiva. Esta molcula presenta una distribucin angular y el valor experimental para el ngulo H-O-H es de 104 40.       La polaridad que presenta esta molcula producto de las diferencias de electronegatividades, permite atraer otros hidrgenos de otras molculas con polaridades comparables , originando de esta forma los llamados enlaces por puente de Hidrgeno. A modo de ejemplo, en las toallas de papel (la fibra de celulosa tiene este tipo de enlaces por puente de Hidrgeno) y es precisamente por esta razn que podemos ocupar el papel para secarnos, digamos las manos. Una situacin opuesta a la planteada aparece a propsito de los plsticos, los cuales presentan en su estructura Hidrgeno, sin embargo los enlaces son totalmente covalentes y en consecuencia no existe la polaridad necesaria como ocurre con el agua (por lo tanto, el agua no la moja). En el caso de los metales, simplemente los humedece, facilitando su oxidacin, sin embargo ac observamos otro comportamiento del agua.

Bueno... eso digo yo!|`|p7XBgmalaa	La respuesta de Juan Daniel C es bastante completa (y compleja, debo agregar, incluso para alguien entendido en el tema). Debido a los puentes de hidrgeno que menciona l, el agua cuenta con una gran tensin superficial, que es la misma propiedad que le permite a los insectos pararse en la superficie de los charcos o lagos sin hundirse. Debido a esta gran tensin superficial, es que el agua, cuando se encuentra sobre una superficie lo suficientemente porosa, la moja.

04830ff9addfcfcf0bb3b7ad697c8b42aa	I believe just like New York was trying to get her 15 minutes of fame from sleeping with Flavor Flav those men were on the show for the same reason.  I mean from looking at the prize they would get it really wasn't worth the effort so why not promote something.  New York has a mannish face and fake boobs, nails and hair so I can't see anything worth trying to win.  A few of the men did mentioned they were doing things from their exposure on the show (12-pack).  I didn't expect the outcome to be another else because of the person I felt New York was.  She isn't someone who will find love because there isn't a man alive who could put up with her demands and screaming for too long.  Even her own Mom isn't married anymore because she got divorced and New York's Dad should consider himself lucky to get away from that drama.    Hope that helps..........|`|82bc9240a5e8c555431f2668b89573b2aa	I'm pretty sure some parts are staged and cut out. you don't remember when chance took his chain off for the 10k she was walking out the door and she said "yall want me to just act like that didn't happen". it's some stuff the producers stage up to make it more interesting. i mean lets be serious VH1 ratings used to suck before The Flavor of love.|`|AA10860164	I don't think it's staged, I think that some people came on the show to find true love, and others had "15 minutes of fame" agendas, otherwise, it could also just be a gimmmick to boost the ratings for vh 1.|`|yp92zJ32aa	I always thought the reunions was staged even for flavor of love. It looked somewhat rehearsed and staged. I dont think new york and flav were loooking for love maybe a good time and if love happens to come along so be it but i truly believe that the reunion was staged. And it is desperate to go on a reality tv show for "love" i mean half of these relationships dont even last|`|JnOWGwLlaa	duh! there there for her body and money and to be discovered. Flava Flav looks like a old man and i feel bad for New York because after all she didnt find love. I dont really think people went on the reality show to be discovered, they get paid for being on that show and they could get a career out of that. Ok your riight new york is ugly and so is her mom, she inherited it from her. Ok bye!|`|AA11693591	New York shouldn't have talked crap about Tango's Mom.  She looked like a tramp on the show. Hello....If you wear a backless dress, don't where a bra that goes across your back. She's trash !|`|AA11497473	I think some portions of the show are staged. After all, the bottom line of any show is to make money.  I don't believe anyone goes on that type of dating show to find love. Everyone has an agenda whether they admit it or not. Look at some of the guys on the show. Now do you really think that someone like Romance or Boston would seriously be interested in New York if she were not on TV. She's not that pretty and her personality..... c'mon.|`|12112a25d0ef6cbb6c1e06de2a413656aa	Its staged like Survivor, Americas Next Top Model, and real world. Tiffany Pollard or whoever she is will never be taken seriously do you guys no she is like 25.  VH1 gave her the mansion the show was taped in.  Somebody needs to dig up her past and embarrass her like she tries to do to everybody else.  I'm sure she used to get beat up alot. Her mother isn't a Christian, because what Christian would raise there daughter like that? Come on people stop watching that show. Oh....yeah...wait a minute we love to see people fight, cuss, and make themselves look uneducated.

LluOh0J6aa	Sesshoumaru's heart is changing and he feels compassion and cares for Rin even though he doesn't show it. He also hates Inuyasha so much because he blames Inuyasha and his mother for the death of his father and how his father met such a horrible end. Because he wanted his father to be alive so that he could surpass him in power. Also his father gave Inuyasha the sword that he thinks that should be his. But eventually he get it in the manga why his father gave Inuyasha the sword and not him and then Sesshomaru give the tenseiga to Inuyasha and they merge into the black tensaiga.  The two sword use to be one but tensaiga couldn't hold all that power so it split into sword. Inuyasha father's intention was to always give Inuyasha both sword. But by give Inuyasha his sword Sesshomaru will gain something greater.|`|HZIjzjucaa	because rin tried to take care of him when he got hit by the tensegia.|`|AA11932907	your mind is the key to the answer......|`|56xAhl25aa	because she tried to help him and brought him food when he was injured.  they dont hate each other really; they only fight because sesshomaru wants the tetseiga so he's trying to kill inuyasha and get it

8df11d168accf941bf3130e6f62ef19baa	I agree, I think Holly really loves him, but she can never get a baby and a regular family from Hef. I think Bridgette loves Playboy not Hef, and Kendra cracks me up she definitely won't be hanging with Hef if it wasn't for the lifestyle.|`|31f8ea384cad622d874b65640369f99faa	I think they both care about him. Their relationships with him are different than Holly's because Holly is the "main" girlfriend.     Don't be a hater...I don't think they would be there unless they both cared about him as a person.|`|4bccfcb750f38933720278eef87d2dc5aa	I love the show!!! I hate kendra though..her laugh is so annoying and she is so immature..she is NOT there for hef...someone asked why else would they be there if they didnt care...ummmHELLO...playboy mansion..duh..n-e-way..i know what u are talking about...and I agree...Holly really cares for!!! bridgett and kendra...could care less..they like the environment and all the fun and attention!!|`|57e61931a9d704652ea4f4bbd93bad4eaa	i think so to and when huff dies his sons will inherit playboy

mqauE2T2aa	I totally agree - I thought she was terrible and that she song is terrible.    I think maybe they're just leading her on b/c they're friends with Slade and b/c they don't want to be mean on TV.  They'll just encourage her for a while and then tell her no record company was interested in the end.  If she actually gets a record deal, I'll lose all faith in the music industry.  Her voice isn't good *and* she's not cute enough to compensate for that.
db781eaa1ca0bde7b799f27300fe82b5aa	The director has stated that the line was unscripted and unknown to her and the actor has declined to repeat the line when asked. There appears to be growing agreement, however, among careful listeners that the line is indeed "I'll always remember the past few days with you. Don't part mad. Tell him the truth. OK?"    I saw that movie in theaters with friends. They hated it. I loved it. The overwhelming reason they didn't like the movie was actually this scene. They wanted desperately to know what he said. I knew that it really wasn't intregal to loving the film.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	"In case this is over, I wish you all the best" it is in reference to rumors that Scarlette Johansen was up for a Golden Globe and perhaps an Oscar.|`|3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	The whisper is deliberately unheard, because, like the entire experience, it is a private and personal moment between Bill and Scarlett's characters---it is the reason the story is special---it's about two people lost, who find each other for a brief time and share something that only the two of them feel together...what's not important is the whisper, but that Bill Murray's character comes back to whisper that message to her, to share with her one last moment, to let her know, maybe, how special the time they had was to him, as well as to her...|`|TdIRRjLJaa	I think he whispers, "I'm wearing your underwear."    I loved that movie too, by the way.|`|bc3d47e5b75e773ef0e10cb8e626b0c9aa	I just want to reiterate what Jenny B stated....absolutely wonderful movie!

Are all the years we shared so easy to forget?  Does this mean that you've won?  Are you finally having fun?  Is she your dream come true?  Oh, she sure looks good but she won't ever be   As good as I was to you    The room got awfully quiet and everybody stared  Finally the waiter said, "Should I bring another chair."  She said, "No. I was just leaving." but as she walked out the door  She said, "Honey, you can have him I don't want him anymore."    Good as I was to you Is this the thanks I get?  Are all the years we shared so easy to forget?  Is this the way it's done?Looking out for number one?  Did you think it through?  She sure looks good but she won't ever be   Good as I was to you.    Does this mean that you've won?  Are you finally having fun?  Is she your dream come true?  Oh, she sure looks good but she won't ever be   As good as I was to you  As good as I was to you|`|d8f075268d9fd86ba7314c7a4596a5adaa	That song was "Good as I Was to You" by Lorri Morgan|`|3e8d64ca4f47f8ac2e24fc5d9cc71d4eaa	I think it might be Lorrie Morgan *As good as I was to you*

gIFYYhEWaa	Olly W,  You don't have to go to Hawaii to buy a ukulele.  You might be able to find a good one at your local music store.  Some music stores carry Lanikai ukuleles.  I'd go for a Lanikai LU-21C.  This is a good inexpensive ukulele that has a really nice sound.  It's only a few inches larger than the soprano but will make it easier to chord b/c the frets are wider.  http://www.americanmusical.com/Item--i-L... Scan on down and you'll see the different sizes.

83d1f064395163d2902d7dcc051652c5aa	The main Borat is a British Actor who also played the Ali G character.  The Actor (who is always in character as Borat) travels through America just doing dumb little funny things.  But apparently it has pissed off the Russians because apparently "Borat" is from Kazakstan, which previously belonged to Russia.  The first time I saw Borat was on the MTV European Music Awards and I thought that he was hilarious.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but can't wait until it comes to Europe.     Hopefully that helps.  You can check www.imdb.com to see the actor who plays borat.|`|35d5775398a0a8d4adb4c8150613cea1aa	this one guy comes from a foreign country and tries the culture of america. at least that's what i get from it|`|92903c528fcf8e423b72a313a29c1532aa	Borat is a reporter, born in 1972 in Ku?zek, Kazakhstan. He is the son of Asimbala Sagdiyev and Boltok the Rapist, who is also his maternal grandfather. He is also the former husband of Oksana Sagdiyev, who was the daughter of Mariam Tuyakbay and Boltok the Rapist. His relationship with his mother seems to be unpleasant, and Borat has commented that "she wishes she was raped by another man." Borat has a sister named Natalya, regarded as the fourth-best prostitute in Kazakhstan, and with whom he often fornicates, and a younger brother named Bilo, who is mentally retarded and must be kept locked behind a metal door or in a cage. In an interview, Borat said, "My brother Bilo has a small head but very strong arms. He have 204 teeth (193 in mouth 11 in nose)! You can do anything to him - he do not remember nothing! He is a sex crazy ... all day long he in his cage look on porno & rub rub rub!"[2]    Borat attended the Astana University, where he studied English, journalism, and plague research. He has been married several times, once to his half-sister plough. His first wife was Oksana Sagdiyev, another half-sister. She was shot and killed by neighbour Nursultan Tuyakbay, who mistook her for a bear, while accompanying her brother-in-law Bilo on a walk in the forest. Borat was largely unaffected by this event and even celebrated it, as he was able to buy a new wife who he claimed not as boring. He maintains extramarital relations with a girlfriend, a mistress and at least one prostitute. He has three children: 12-year-old Bilak, 12 year-old Biram (whose mother is Borat's sister, Natalya), and 11 year-old Hooeylewis (his favourite child); and seventeen grandchildren. Borat used to have a pet pig, Igor, whom he claims to have loved, although he and his family eventually did eat it, including the eyes. He has had many jobs ranging from ice maker to animal sperm retriever (he claims that rumours of a connection between these jobs are unfounded). He also claims to have previously worked as a Gypsy catcher, boasting that he can "hit a gypsy with a rock from fifteen meters away if chained  ten if not". He also claims that he can carry a woman against her will and has done so, once carrying his future wife for 1600 meters (one mile).    Baron Cohen has listed Borat's hobbies as ping pong, disco dancing, sunbathing, shooting dogs, and taking pictures of women on the toilet. In addition to being a sexist and a homophobe, Borat is prejudiced against Jews, Uzbeks and Gypsies. Borat has said that he once suffered a "very bad Gypsy attack," in which his wife Oksana Sagdiyev was stolen and "they touch horse in very bad way; it was depressed". Borat claims to have the tightest anus of his village, tight enough to open a bottle of Pepsi. He has had many diseases including gonorrhoea, syphilis and herpes.    Borat's religion is not clear, but he states in the movie that he worships "the hawk"; by the end of the film, Borat appears to have brought Christianity to his village. In Da Ali G Show, Baron Cohen (as Borat) travels to England and the United States, to report on the different cultures. Baron Cohen's plot for the motion picture has the government of Kazakhstan sending Borat to the United States to film a documentary on American culture. As Borat, he said about the film, "if it not success, I will be execute."    More about the movie on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borat

AA10704364	My daughter did this party when her daughter was around that age and it was a great success and lots of fun for the adults and the guests.  It was one of the best parties I ever attended.  So creative and great fun for all involved.    Have a little girls' Fashion Show.   Title it:  "(name of your daughter)'s Beautiful Pajama Party Fashion Show".       This will entail getting help from either adults or the guests themselves.      You will need the following:  -makeup - different kinds;    -nail polish - different colours;    -makings for little hats with little stars or decorations to stick to them  (optional);    -an adult or guest to man each of the little makeup & nail polish booths and to apply the makeup or nail polish;    -an adult or guest to train the guests/models to walk back and forth like models, showing off their new hat, makeup, nail polish and pajamas.    -adult or guest to play a tape or CD of fast appropriate & fun music for the guests to march back and forth to.  -an announcer who will describe each model from their card that will be filled out at each of the tables.    - Give each guest a card with the following marked on it:    _______________(name of guest) is wearing makeup to highlight her beautiful _______ (blue) eyes and creamy _________(peaches and cream) skin.  Her nails are covered with _________(neon blue) polish with little stars on them.  She is wearing her very best pajamas - __________________(mauve flannelette) with ***** cat slippers  to match.  ________________(name) wants to be a _________________(doctor) when she grows up.    Set up three little tables - one with makeup,  one with nail polishes;  one with makings for little hats.    Have the guests move from table to table choosing their colours and having the makeup and polish applied, and making up their own pretty hats to match their pajamas.    The 'fashion show coordinator' will train the girls to walk to the music - showing off their new wonderful makeup and nail polish.    When all that is done - the fashion show will take place.    Put on the music.  Have each guest hand their completed card to the announcer who will announce the details of each little model, and everyone will clap when each is done.    Continue to do each little girl and when all is done, announce who did the makeup, the nail polish, and who the coordinator is and thank anyone else who helped.    What a lot of fun!!    Enjoy.|`|b4a2ae90298c0b35884c9c9d04f1643faa	Have an 80's themed sleepover.|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	Its winter so do the opposite...have hawaiian theme|`|e2227078f3acba0822876f10d3d15515aa	a night club theme but no drinking {of alcohal}kind of dark,loud music,glow sticks,DJ,disco ball,the most impostant thing of all is have FUN!! :)        you can also do a winterwonderland theme with fake snow everywere,ice skating,hot coco,lots of sky blue    I AM A 12 YEAR OLD?|`|de49fc964b97ea194fb4044fae176b1faa	A winter wonderland!

He was the only person to ever play Jim Taggart. Other characters came and went, but no one ever played Taggart, except McManus. The only credible successor was Alex Norton in 2002 as Matt Burke.|`|AA11682474	Not a lot, i'm afraid he died.|`|92e4b30e6e8b288b7de6647cddcbeff0aa	He is currently in the latter stages of decomposition|`|B4hDPb4yaa	The last person to play Taggart is dead|`|07419f52412a5fe0c57235a3b3762e08aa	mark mcmanus  I am sure his brother was the singer in the band SWEET
32aaa2e216418b7f971d9dfe5e56b9abaa	as a Jamaican i would want to say that he was a morally good person seeing as he put j.a. on the map by exposing reggae to the world . however, many of his songs were morally incorrect and the fact that he smoked weed is not important as it was part of his religion but the numerous affairs he had and children out of wedlock is also immoral.  he also did some very good songs  with positive messages , so I'm torn. i guess he is some where in the middle , but aren't we all?|`|acAnVzskaa	He neglected his kids and was on heavy drugs? What do you think?|`|db3b66826b3823af36292042307c965daa	First of all let me say that he was a good father despite his having many children outside of wedlock and they are all well taken care of and unlike many men his affairs were not a secret to his wife.   He was a religious man with deep beliefs about equality, justice and brotherly love.  As far as the marijuana I have to say get over it.  Alcohol, nicotine, caffeine are worse for your health and yet they are illegal.  Marijuana was made illegal in this country primarily because white slave owners were afraid their slaves would rebel if they smoked it.  How is that for morality?|`|eeebe4ce6aa910843fbc64c45cbb4c89aa	I am a Jamaican and I think he was not morally a good person but at the same time he was not a morally bad person.He is just  a normal person like anyone else who do wrongs and rights.Smoking is a big thing for rastafarian in Jamaica.It is a part of thie roots.His songs were great and he sings conscious lyrics.He has helped make Jamaican reggae what it is today.|`|AA11541126	morals are relative. i believe he was a good man...|`|Fdi9CV85aa	Well his dad was a Jew, so that prob made him corrupt.

T3X7Aci4aa	Some rappers have but HIP HOP hasn't.    EDIT: I wonder how many people will view this incorrectly (I'm guessing about 75%)|`|IFf5r9zAaa	No.     Hip hop as a movement is not responsible for what certain rappers may choose to portray in their lyrics, any more than rock as a genre can be held responsible for rock videos protraying women as anorexic prostitutes.   If lyrics bother me, I don't listen - nobody's forcing me to.  And if I want a role model for my daughter, I'd pick MC Lyte or Lauryn Hill over Britney and Madonna any day.|`|AA12036288	No.|`|wORZuAOgaa	not more than any other american pastime.  i.e. cheerleaders, playboy bunnies, rock videos...|`|iXEIDMa4aa	No.|`|LCqiEYtXaa	Yes, very much so. Thats a big part of Hip Hop's appeal..... the "hoes" and "bitches" as most rappers affectionately call females. Realistically, this is done because there are several women whom encourage this type of behavior. They are usually found in strip clubs, the chicks that wear "seductive outfits" (hooker uniforms) showing thier goodies but then getting upset because men view them as sexual objects, and females that like "bad boys" or "hoods".     In laments terms, if females taste in men improves, hip hops overall objectivity of females will improve. But till then...... all we will get is p poppin on a handstand.|`|c9HSiX3Eaa	i think hip hop has degraded women in the past 20 years, especially in more recent years, when a sense of materialism started to take over mainstream hip hop.    but then again, the entire music industry seems to have grown more and more corrupt through the years, and women are being viewed more and more as objects. this is the reason why girls like britney spears or jessica simpson got big in the first place, and why female artists who can actually write and sing have been ignored by the media...... (sorry i'm getting off track here).    i think that the state of mainstream hip hop in recent years has been degrading to both men and women. dumbing people down to sell a lifestyle to tha masses. enticing people with an impossible ideal, playing on our insecurities and most primitive instincts. and the only one who benefits is some guy wearing a suit sitting behind a big desk in an office with a nice view, laughing all the way to the bank.    the only way to stop this is to stop buying into the ideals they are selling you!! refuse to buy into the idea that our appearance and material possessions define who we are. these ideals are hurtful to ourselves and only benefit the corporations and businesses that don't give a crap about you and only want your money.    sorry i sort of went off there and went in all sorts of directions.......    short answer to has hip hop degraded women in the past 20 years?    yes.    and it's also degraded men too.|`|dm9y6L6haa	its oly degrading if u take offense to what is being said if the women they talk about in the music isnt the woman u are or want to be or try to be then f   uck it just do u|`|80ef78f5bbb0a874c663ec5b0450c650aa	YES  it has and i dont say yes very often|`|BeeQj080aa	Everyone woman isn't a HOE or a B!TCH.  If you're a woman and you get offended by those kinds of words, then you're probably a hoe or a b!tch.|`|U6GhdItcaa	I would have to say no. Reason being no one can make someone do things that they dont choose. If your a female video model and the roll calls for you to be have naked you then have a decision. You can choose to take the roll, indicating that you dont have a problem with it or you can make a stand and turn it down. Lets be honest sex sells and if your a young, well built sexy woman the companys want to use your body to help sell a product.    Ps Hip hop is a movement / culture. Rap is music!!!!|`|IIkbOmyZaa	Rappers: Yes    Hip-Hop: No.|`|WuqtpGpqaa	yeah a lyric that come to mind is bizzare out of d12    "all bxxches are wxxes even my stinkin @ss mom"    i think that is pretty bad

jbAr62ybaa	You can watch excerpts, videos on You Tube; but not full versions.         http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=BmX9N8C8nk...         TV's PBS broadcast more than a dozen complete versions of Met. performances every year: excellent..          If you have a functioning DVD player but can't afford to purchase operatic productions, I would suggest you check out your local public or university, college libraries and check them out for free.         Amazon.com quite often has sales on operatic DVDs; I purchased a complete set of Wagner's "Ring" cycle(NEW, 4 full length operas, 15-16 hrs.)for only around $80 - can't beat a price like that.         And with the easy to follow sub-titles in English, I think I really prefer to sit at home in my easy chair and watch them, rather than going to a live performance.

Generally, when a show is filmed in front of an audience, there is a light that comes on that tells them to laugh. The people in the audience could be anyone, it could be you if you got a ticket.     In some shows like another poster said, they use canned laughter. Which is when they tape people laughing and play it over when they think something is funny.|`|X40Ww89qaa	it is a recording|`|H4izLRZZaa	i don't  think so|`|ElLBELGeaa	They make a recording of people laughing and use that. Come on, sometimes the jokes suck and the audience wouldn't laugh at those jokes|`|HDyqzvUkaa	Sometimes it's a recording, sometimes they flash a sign saying "applause" to cue the audience.  I doubt they pay anybody cause it's pretty easy to get people to clap.    Often people going to a comedy show are there to laugh and will laugh at anything resembling a joke, whereas someone at home is wondering how anyone can think it's funny.|`|jZguzD2Raa	its a recording|`|xsiKLwJRaa	no it's a soundboard|`|6gQWdDWmaa	It depends on the show, some shows, such as Friends and Fresh Prince, were genuinely filmed in front of a live audience, who would laugh as and when they felt appropriate. But a lot of shows, such as Hannah Montana, use a recording, known as "canned laughter".|`|Q0kflnXsaa	It depends what shows. Sometimes its recorded, sometimes its a real audience because it's a live show.
KHC2oE8iaa	hip hop is forever changing. it always comes out different. east coast had their sound as did the midwest, west coast, and the south. SO WHAT ELSE IS THERE? they have to swtich it up because it's been done. look at justin timberlake. stars like him and brittani spears have turned to urban beats. you have rock groups rapping now because you cant keep doing the same **** everyday. it gets predictable and boring. that's what wayne is doing. leona lewis the same thing. her first single is actually an up beat pop r&b song. so no hip hop isnt dead. it's changing up.|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	only lil wayne cause no rapper that dumb to make him self look like a dumbass|`|BnTYoxUIaa	it's only lil wayne and no one else.|`|OpBFc27iaa	like who? besides wayne..its going pop, not rock.|`|bPnmavjZaa	The real hip hoppers will never go rock.

3SwdfTTjaa	Some People Change --- Montgomery Gentry|`|6pevwBizaa	Some People Change --- Montgomery Gentry     His old man was a rebel yeller:  Bad boy to the bone.  He'd say: "Can't trust that other fella,"  He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin.  He was raised to think like his Dad:  Narrow mind full of hate.  On the road to no-where fast,  Till the Grace of God got in the way.  Then he saw the Light an' hit his knees an' cried an' said a prayer:  Rose up a brand new man; left the old one right there.     Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.  Don't give up hope: some people change.  Against all odds, against the grain,  Love finds a way: some people change.     She was born with her mother's habit:  You could say: "It's in her blood."  She hates that she's gotta have it:  As she fills her glass up.  An she'd love to kill that bottle,  But all she can think about,  Is a, a better life, a second chance,  An' everyone she's letting down.  She throws that bottle down.     Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.  Don't give up hope: some people change.  Against all odds, against the grain,  Love finds a way: some people change.     Thank God for those who make it:  Let them be the Light.     (Let them be the light)  (Some people change.)  Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.  Don't give up hope: some people change.

If Dimebag wasn;t shot they'd still be coming out with A+ quality music|`|TUxPf25vaa	they're both really good but im gonna say pantera  they kept metal alive in the 90's and dimebag is probably better than slash.

u8ia6oKxaa	Good question.  I sometimes find myself asking when did I start to listen to the "brutal" DM when at somepoint in the past I never would have listen to them.  I guess I draw the line when I no longer hear any melody or musical talent.  When I no longer hear this, It sounds just like noise to me and I no longer like it.  Since most DM is pretty Tecnical, I can appreciate "Loud" music but the technicality makes it interesting to me    The heaviest I like, would be bands simlar to:    Immolation  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLi3tSA-t...  Nile  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CD5VbGbW...  Hate Eternal  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9zluT_c3...    The stuff I don't like would be which could be considered heavier:    The Bezerker  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gqVVQ-q8...  Waking the Cadaver  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLI_iD4ra...    ***I guess some people can see melody here, but I just don't hear it...or its at least not enjoyable melody if there is any|`|RKMWeMk9aa	When the vocals are too incoherent, to understand here is an example.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6US8LGj...|`|uhZ38xYkaa	It destroys music in general, but Maiden is one thing.|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	what your saying was more or less my beef with Nu Metal and i suppose more recently Metalcore... lot's of huffing and puffing and 'brutality' about nothing in particular... i mean Limp Bizkit's 'Break Stuff'... come on! (there's my answer to your mq ;)    This may sound a bit patronising or conceited, but i prefer a more 'intelligent' noise if you catch my drift... but as with all music and 'tastes'... it's all subjective imo... (so what i deem to be 'intelligent' noise in my mind... i'm talking out of my **** i know ha ha!)|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Like you said, when it affects the music negatively all depends on the person listening. Obviously, we have different tastes in music and brutality is way more appealing to me than it is to you.     I just don't think the music is as bad as you do when I listen to it. And also, for core, like I told you before, the feeling that people who are into the genre get from it is f*cking great! It's better than any high or drunk I've ever experienced.     Nothing is the "future" of music. Things may be the future for one genre of music but you can not find one thing that is in every single genre.    I'm not even going to lie and say I think core genres are the most amazing, musically, genres ever or anything even close to that. But, for me, it is the most all around appealing. I love the deep growls that seem to just be so smooth, i love the breakdowns that make the hairs stand up on my arms, and the i find absolutely nothing wrong with most of the other parts of other bands.    MQ: One of the worst bands I've ever heard in the worst genre I've ever heard! This is just silly noise.  Torsof*ck - "Raped by Elements"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JblFx1aXp...|`|fdMFsw7aaa	i say music should be hard to play, not something some idiot can make in a couple of minutes on a computer (example: pop, rap, and techno aren't music) also, music shouldn't put you to sleep freom being too slow (example: country, alternative, classical, and easy rock are not good music) i say music should be very fast (speed metal, power metal, neo classic metal, NWBHM) or have lots of bass (thrash metal, melodic death metal, some nu metal, some screamo) but not too insane that you can't tell if they're choking or singing (cannibal corpse, cradle of filth) and not so high of a voice, that it sounds like they could be a chick (hair metal, judas priest) i do like listening to some bands with female singers (arch enemy, nightwish, and evanesance), just as long as i can tell what gender they are. the heaviest band i listen to is children of bodom plobably|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Despised Icon pushes the envelope.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-cro_l8H...    Suicide Silence is as close as I could come too. I think I would tolerate it alot more had they not recorded the snare sound with a notebook.    I see where you are coming from. I enjoy the BRUTALITY and HEAVY more than any other music there is, I just can't think of any band right now that would qualify as being too much.|`|rx4GMXUdaa	I actually enjoy Suicide Silence :] i really think whether the band is catergorized by "noise" or "music" is dependent upon the listener.     I love "hardcore" metal. Suicide Silence, Dance Club Massacre, Annotations of an Abortion are just a few other bands that sound somewhat like some might just call noise. But as i said, it depends on the person :] and i like it because it makes me feel energized and it makes me feel pumped when i need to be :] specially for moshing :]|`|WVb7Jnp2aa	for the record Suicide Silence sucks. There are much better BDM bands out there, though its not my favourite genre. To be honest would a not so talented band be any good even if they weren't brutal. Good black and brutal metal exists you just need to know where to find it. Heavy and Brutal sucks without a point i agree. Noise can be good sometimes. I've heard bands genre's described as noise. You either like stuff that is brutal because you like the brutallity and it makes you feel good.   Some good bands that i would presume most would call noise:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2pMFj5LN...    Try to find something from this band, i can send you their demo's if you really want me to.     http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?i...    This stuff was written by like a twelve year old, which makes it even more creepy.  but this stuff does sound like noise, and it is truly great    The later band i would call noise, the former i would call grindcore.|`|AA10652867	I'd have to say Nightwish, both Tarja and Anette eras.  They always sseem to get it right for me, the compositions are just amazingly well done. Arch Enemy is also another band I love.    As for my bad pick: Motionless in White. I just find it to be a bad crash between instruments and a wailing voice that sounds like a dog being ran over repeatedly. The players have potential, but the band is simply producing noise.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Why do people like that? I don't know, it's all noise to me, but it goes great in it's own genre, right?    Like Death, Mayhem, Opeth, etc. All of those bands (IMO) rock.    MA: The JonBenet. (Screamo sh*t band)    NextBillgates is one of those people who probably loves The JonBenet.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	When it's all nothing but screeching like a demented owl over beating a defenseless guitar and drum kit to death with no melody whatsoever then it's just noise to Me.    MA: I don't really know I'm not that fond of brutalizing My ears.    *Edit*  They don't all suck, You can't generalize like that. Opeth doesn't suck. That's who this edit was for, nextbillgates|`|pVTevFJgaa	Actually, I think that extreme noise CAN be good and be sort of called Music, but it should not be overdone during ALL the song/album.    It can be used to create a chaotic or scary atmosphere, but if that's ALL the song has, then it can get noise.|`|283tO9j9aa	I think Venom is going too far. It's just a mess really. It doesn't matter how heavy music is, there's no excuse to be lazy about how you write.    Slayer for example, they're pretty heavy to most people (not all of course) but they have proper riffs.    It is hard to know where to draw the line though- some stuff can sound incredibly heavy and brutal but also be really good, whereas some band that tries to be heavy and fails can (and usually will) sound like crap. I'm afraid other than my initial Venom comment I can't help much!|`|jhYUvRaDaa	Music stops being music when it is TOO LOUD for the human ear- I went to an open air festival and really enjoyed what a certain band- GRAND MAGUS were playing yet when I went nearer the stage to view the band- I could feel the sonic vibration on my body- just like I had a mate punching me- my ears couldnt take it and my mind was like- get me outa here.   There are also bands that are too drugged up to co-ordinate and bands that thrash their instruments so much that the music doesn't make sense.   Even metallica can harmonise and groups like the disturbed can churn out some pretty good music but some of this screamo and death metal is beyond my taste and quite literally should be sent out int space where they might find a more receptive audiane- ie. a few asteroids etc.|`|TUxPf25vaa	any black or death metal band  (they all suck)  lol i dont know what The JonBenet is  i just listen to classic metal stuff

7B2s7maWaa	Editing :D    You know I went backwards instead of starting with Showbiz their debut.I actually started with Absolution.  I would say start out with either Showbiz or Absolution.  I say either of those two because Showbiz was their first debut CD, so you will hear everything from early in their career. It's refreshing and fantastic.  I also suggest Absolution because and I may sound a bit bias here it's amazing. Every song is just brilliant in my humble opinion.   Also to me on Absolution they just sound more mature.  Not saying that on Showbiz they weren't it's just that they have expanded their sound and grown as  a band.  I would say either of those two personally I would still go for Absolution.        Trust me I know some fellow Muse fans who started with Black Holes and Revelations first so starting with Absolution if you want to would be fine.       Hope I helped. :]|`|AlrCZJ3saa	Muse, psh listen to Pete Burns- better yet look him up on youtube. You will remember him for the rest of your insignificant days alive.|`|AA11903286	well muse is absolutely awesome  you cant go wrong with any of their cds  my first one was Absolution  then i want back to the older stuff like showbiz and origin of symmetry  so just pick one of those :-D|`|SyoBirYDaa	Origin of Symmetry :)      wth? a hatsune miku avatar? lol|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Get Black Holes and Revelations. It's an amazing album.

t17srjy9aa	hey man im filipino too. Those guys dont know how real music should sound like. These tunes played on the radio are always offbeat. personally pop music like t-pain and  wayne are not hot. they both whine on their music and its always  off tempo. I say ignore those guys, just play your personal collection like me, and never put on fm radio.|`|6e7c5613f15ec88b290050a52ad86baeaa	don't worry about them foos..  BTNH are my favort group and is the best group of all time hands down.. you listen to good music that has meaning behind it.. not like these other foo "rapping" about bubble gum and candy shops and crap like that.. look out for the new Bone Thugs album comin in june.. all 5 back together and new single later this month..     BTNH for life|`|y1TDricRaa	ok well that kid of just really fucked up.  You dont have to be poor or rich or anything to listen to specific music. You like what you like.  i mean i like everything from classical to rap, hip hop, pop, techno, punk, rock, indie.   And i dont look or dress like a specific type of music.  The kid is just a dumbass.  Just let them laugh. Maybe he just doesnt like bone thugs too thats why he laughed.|`|BnTYoxUIaa	I'm filipino also and I listen to what you listen to like 2pac, bone thugs, biggie, nas, and many more. You could listen to anything you want too. Those people that laughed at you are lil wayne stans.|`|iyAupkiFaa	awl good man . listen to whatever you feel like it . "FUCKKKK THA REST" raps the best . BIGGIE|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I like 2pac and bone thugs too, but I also think its kind of corny to listen to it all the time.  A lot of guys who listen to it do it to just "look hard" I think.  Like whenever I hear a car drive by bumpin that music, me and my friends laugh cause its corny and it makes me wanna roll my eyes.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	you seem like a young and very open minded dude so let me school you on something you need to know now. people like that dude in your class i consider very stupid. and dawg you CANNOT ever talk to people like that. you'd have more luck with talking to a doorknob. and you trying to persuade them makes you look more worse off then them if people know them to be a fool. good music is good music PERIOD. him laughing just told you everything you needed to know about him. close minded, slow, and idiotic. keep doing your thing man.|`|OpBFc27iaa	yeah same here, xept, when i say bone thugs, most kids dont even know who im talking about...if i say pac, they think im obsessing over him, which im not.    alot of kids dont appreciate good music and just think its cool to listen to whatevrs hot at the moment.|`|96sT6TrHaa	can are free to listen to whatever the eff you want to eff the other people|`|d8aW4fFNaa	What grade are you in, those kids must have been ten years old for being so ignorant.|`|LfhcFzPpaa	wow.  i hate ignorant people.  i mean its not a crime to listen to it.  if i were to ask you what you were listening to i might make a face of surprise...but not like a rude face.  just ignore it && turn it up louder.  (:  && lil wayne is the bomb..  that's also ignorant.|`|IFWishIKaa	I don't think it was necessarily the artist you were listening to. I think it's because you're not black and if you were to be listening to any kind of rap, it would be commercial rap. You know, what mostly comes on the radio (Soulja Boy, Lil Wayne, etc). Bone-Thugz is an old school rap group to black people nowadays, they're probably wondering why you even know who they are. You probably have Filipinos in your school who listen to commercial rap, have the gold chains, cap, saggy pants, and whatever comes wit tryin to look gangsta. We tend to look down upon that. And though you may not be that way, and you listen to what you can really relate to and feel it, we live in a society where we generalize, and you get swept into a pool with those other posers in their eyes. It'n not fair, but it happens. Keep bein you.

bYlEqiKVaa	I know what you mean poster.  While it may have had to do with quality in the past, it doesn't really explain those occurences in current Simpsons episodes.  It's altogether likely that it was simply a last minute edit to the dialogue in the script.  Keep in mind how long it takes for animators to do one episode, and if all the producers want to do is change a word or phrase, it's cheaper and easier to just dub over the original line, and hope that people don't notice enough to be distracted from the story.      Sometimes the edits are done in the creative interest of the story, for example, just to get a bigger laugh by changing one word around.  It happens in live action TV shows too, just in less prevalence.  Usually, when a line of dialogue needs to be added, they just use ADR, which would account for a disparity in the quality of audio you hear in one particular scene.|`|IFcbqkQhaa	No I don't think so.  Becuase The Simpsons episode was made in 1980 and 1990's and the quality of cartoons were so low it made the words that came out of their mouths look fake.  Now, in The Simpsons latest episodes, the voice sounds good and accurate.  Just Like Family Guy's first episode the mouth's movement made it look like the words weren't really coming out of their mouths.|`|cjOWwLhcaa	That was in the early seasons when the mouth didn't match the words. Now they match fine in my opinion.

Makes you want to stay and never leave, her name is Genevive. The one leaving faces of astonishment in quantities of plenty. Moving at velocities too high for many. For players, she's just too sophisticated and trendy, yet so friendly. Almost immaculate, so love is pending.

43hzcys2aa	Read this poem in the other context:    The Ball Poem       What is the boy now, who has lost his ball,  What, what is he to do? I saw it go   Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then   Merrily over--there it is in the water!  No use to say 'O there are other balls':  An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy  As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down   All his young days into the harbour where  His ball went. I would not intrude on him,  A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now   He senses first responsibility  In a world of possessions. People will take balls,  Balls will be lost always, little boy,  And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.  He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,  The epistemology of loss, how to stand up  Knowing what every man must one day know  And most know many days, how to stand up  And gradually light returns to the street  A whistle blows, the ball is out of sight,  Soon part of me will explore the deep and dark  Floor of the harbour . . I am everywhere,  I suffer and move, my mind and my heart move   With all that move me, under the water  Or whistling, I am not a little boy.     John Berryman|`|AA10248966	All Things Considered    All that money he collected,  yet deficits experts projected,  All the projects he planned,  while city traffic was banned,  All the fuss and parades,  as he plans to layoff his aids    All crunch on the train,  while he vacations again,  All our funds have run out,  All his investments worked out,  We just try to make due  While his bailout bonus came through    Was he guilty of power abuse?  All our brains: are they just loose?    John A. Todras  ?1-2009|`|zNEcCyPUaa	i dunno about a personality but i have some christmas ones:    'Twas the night after Christmas, and boy, what a house!   I felt like the devil, and so did my spouse.     The eggnog and turkey and candy were swell,   But ten hours later they sure gave me hell.     The stockings weren't hung by the chimney with care.   The darn things were sprawled on the back of a chair.     The children were nestled all snug in their bed,   And I had a large cake of ice on my head.     When at long last I dozed off in a nap,   The ice woke me up as it fell in my lap.     For some unknown reason I wanted a drink,   So I started in feeling my way to the sink.     I got along fine 'til I stepped on the cat.   I cannot recall what occurred after that.     When I came to, the house was all flooded with light,   Although under the table I was high as a kite.     While visions of sugar plums danced in my head,   I somehow got up and climbed back into bed.     Then what to my wandering mind should appear,   But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.     Then the sleigh seemed to change to a mammoth fire truck,   And each reindeer turned into a bleary-eyed buck.     I knew in a moment it must be old Nick.   I tried to cry out, but my tongue was too thick.     The old devil whistled and shouted with glee,   While each buck pawed the earth and looked daggers at me.     Then he called them by name and the names made me shudder.   When I heard them I felt like a ship minus rudder.     "Now Eggnog! Bacardi! Four Roes! and Brandy!   Now Fruit Cake! Cold Turkey! Gin Rickey! and Candy!     To the top of his house, to the top of his skull,   Now whack away, crack it with thumps that are dull!"     And then in a twinkling I felt on my roof   The prancing and pawing of each cloven hoof.     How long this went on I am sure I can't say,   Though it seemed an eternity plus a long day.     But finally the night after Christmas had passed,   And I found that I really could think straight at last.     So I thought of the New Year and few days away,   And I made me a vow that no tempter can sway.     I'm sticking to water, don't even want ice,   For there's nothing so tasty, or nothing so nice.     The night after New Year may bother some guys,   But I've learned my lesson, and brother, I'm wise.     You can have your rich food, and your liquor that's red,   But what goes to my stomach won't go to my head.     So here's "Happy New Year" to you one and all.   I'm back on the wagon. I hope I don't fall.    ANDDDDDD    Buy me a beer if you want the story told  Of why I moved down South from the frost and cold.  Why I'm knee deep in therapy, liquor, and pills.  Why I've given up charity in lieu of cheap thrills.    Why I loathe mistletoe, fruitcake and bells --  And why I'll celebrate Xmas when it freezes in hell.  You'll never see this elf make angels in snow.  Hey thanks for the booze  so I guess here it goes:    "Twas the night after Christmas in the North Pole  No creatures were stirring, not one lousy soul.   Santa's house appeared eerily silent  But inside the fat man was hungry, was violent    This workshop of toys for kids of all ages  Was filled with elves quaking in cages.  Who woke up from their long winter's naps   To find themselves snared in a devious trap.    Hours before I had been bingeing on nog  Passed out under the bed, I spied the whole saga.  I saw all my brothers rounded up in cages.   Sleepy victims of wicked midnight rampages.       Then what to my horrified eyes should appear  But a wild-eyed Santa pinching an elf by the ear.  Each little sprite shook in their tights and boots.  That this monster was Santa, no one could refute.    His size and his beard gave him away as St. Nick  His fangs and his scales made me quite sick  Blood seemed to stain his white fluffy trim  He was hunched, drooling, and disgustingly slim.    "Come little helper! Climb into my maw!"  He laughed, then casually ate the elf raw.  He greedily sucked the imp's hide off the bone  I was awed! I was scared! I was truly alone!    Dainty elf paws clutched bars and cried  Drunk on deinal; confounded by why.  (He lost his count during his murderous spree  Thought he'd rounded up most, but forgot about me!)    His hunger was wracking his hunched-over frame  With a crippling appetite that didn't know shame.  "Don't eat us! We love you! Look at our faces!"  The doomed little elves made their sad cases    But Santa ignored them with a swipe of his fist  Pulled out some parchment and started a list:  "Silence, you nuggets  I'm trying to think  Who to char-broil, who to blend into drink.    Who to dice, fillet, bake or panfry  Who to boil in soup, who to stuff in a pie"  These taunts seemed so strange to come from a man  Who held the dreams of children in his hands    Teeth full of gristle, he then sadly revealed  To his captive chorus of angel-faced veal,  That humans are greedy, petty, drunk on their vices.  And each Yuletide revel exacts gruesome prices    The|`|0LHXNXVfaa	okay u wanna hear some funny poems? i'ma make one right now right here...    hmmm  ummm  ahhhhh  errrrrrrr  uhhhhh  ....................................

wecRjE52aa	Anyone can get better at singing. You may think you're bad, but until you know HOW to sing (ie. proper technique and coordination) you can't possibly know if you're any good at it.  You may be really good at it and you just don't know it yet.  Think of it like learning to play tennis or something.  sure you could try it with no lessons, but chances are you will never know if you're good or not until you actually take a lesson and learn how to play, right?  There are some lucky people out there who can just pick it up naturally, but it's easy to catch up to them.    The best way to start is learning is with a few in-person lessons. this way, the teacher can watch you first hand while you sing and observe the things that you're doing wrong that may be preventing you from sounding your best. They can also demonstrate techniques for you and watch you try them yourself, correcting your mistakes.      You could also buy an at-home singing course and teach yourself. While there are lots of good ones out there, personally, i think everyone should still take a few in-person lessons no matter what. The reason is that sometimes you think you might be doing the coordination correctly, when you're really not, and if you're a beginner, you won't be able to tell the difference.     Anyway, here are a few good ones (they're all around $100-$300)    http://www.singingsuccessonline.com/drup...  This is Brett Manning's system - he works with famous artists like the lead singer of paramore, keith urban and Taylor Swift.    http://www.thevocaliststudio.com/  This guy trains more "extreme" rock singers. cool stuff.    Sorry for the long reply. good luck to you!|`|AA10652867	The ability to sing comes with time and tons of practice, but then again, only so few are really able and praised for their singing. Can one get better with singing along to tracks? No. Each and every person has his or her own voice and she or he must learn to know their limits, how high they can go, how low they can go before doing a mistake.    As for practice, hum. Do re mi fa sol la si. This will warm your voice up and you'll be able to have some more control over it.     Now, this dude is awesome:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpvc4SNCW...    I hope that helps!|`|a7eE92RPaa	Totally. Singing isn't just about luck and hitting the jackpot in the gene pool. It's also about technique.|`|ewHA9veraa	yeah i think so if you take singing lessons good luck :)|`|nhNLEFglaa	Take a singing class!
