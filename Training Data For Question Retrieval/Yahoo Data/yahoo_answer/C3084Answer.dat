l2MjVVpRaa	Both are fine. Mckinney is larger and has more infrastructure, but Allen is closely behind.<br>  <br>  You might also consider Anna or Van Alstyne... smaller cities with great schools.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|hIqCpiXKaa	Allen. Allen has slightly better schools than McKinney (thanks to plano). Allen however has one of the weirdest set-up school districts I have ever seen in my life. This city is growing rapidly and they believe that there should only be one high school. Insane. No other major city that I can thank of DFW does this. Your child will not get the individualized attention that they would get in McKinney. McKinney currently has more newer houses going in. The crime rates for both cities are about the same, rather low. As far as communities go, if you want a very united community I would move to allen. Thanks to there school structure the community is insanely tight. In McKinney you have more spread out lax community. I wouldn't be surprised if you never met your neighbors in McKinney. Allen is tight knit. They also have excellent sport programs in all areas.|`|mDYsr62maa	Clarification on the Allen high school system.  Odessa used to do this back in the 60s.  Then Plano did it for decades so they would have the entire district to draw from for the football team.  It does result in a better record so Allen is following close behind.  It should make it another 5 years before the state steps in and insists on new schools.|`|881a34d80a322aec59c6365f1a04140caa	Allen was better for me and very diverse in teachers.   Better community to me is Allen because of it's proximity but still has a very suburban style of living. <br>  <br>  Lived in Allen for 9 years till moving to Keller.

hIqCpiXKaa	You might want to get a quote or two more. It really all depends on where it is located and the water heater installed. Which I cant give you a defiant answer, but it does look overpriced. Best of Luck!|`|5ddcafd96cc37651091167fd6bbdb57daa	Well as water heaters go I am not really good with the type of water heater or the labor for Dallas. However, you can go to Lowe's or Home Depot and they can give you cost of water heater/usual labor expenses based upon your individual installation situation. <br>  <br>  halo75|`|6229aa7a32bdca2ff0f6c77581a35e65aa	wow that's high<br>  <br>  check out home depot on line you can buy a water heater under $300. and have it installed<br>  it might coast a little more if it's in attic or up stairs|`|e0b85fef05a9315124fcd08558a3518caa	For that amount of money I would buy one of those new instant heaters.  Less risk for flooding from the attic.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	It's about double the normal price.<br>  <br>  It IS harder to get one in the attic, but not $1000 worth.<br>  <br>  I'd be calling around to get other prices.<br>  <br>  Lowe's will do it for less than that...|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	In Mo. a heater is less than $300 and only cost $100 or less to install if this helps. Your price seems really out of range for my standards. Things cost more in Texas but almost $1800.00. That's why I wouldn't live there.
PDotv2Hsaa	Such is the life of a bar manager - so unless he 1) also sees that your relationship is deteriorating and wants to do something about it or 2) is willing to change jobs, I'm afraid things will continue status quo.<br>  <br>  You'll have to decide if this is worth it. Carrying on this one-sided relationship is not reasonable. It is obvious that there are other priorities in his life right now and one side values the relationship more than the other. If he cannot even manage a call a day, it speaks volumes.<br>  <br>  Even if you get married, things will probably not change if he continues in this line of work - and it would be difficult to contemplate raising a family with an absent husband and father. If he is adament not to change careers, then you may have to consider a more serious course of action. As you're still young, you have a chance to start anew with someone who would value you more. Even if the thought is daunting, seriously consider before you spend more precious years on a relationship that may potentially go nowhere.|`|RnjuNJ6faa	I myself is 38. At this age, a guy should put career advancement as priority in life. As we are no longer young anymore, sad to said maybe not that competitive in today SG hectic life. When we are finally 40s, as a guy we should be the provider.<br>  <br>  Having said that, has a man myself i believe there is always 2side in every coin. If he really love or cherish you, he will make time for you even just for a call. I always believe that it need two hands to clap in any relationship. From your summary, frankly speaking  i believe that you guys is drifting apart either intentionality or not. I believe for a man this age, he should be sensitive and experience in nurturing a relationship. if he is not trying.....i believe you already have a problem.<br>  <br>  At a age of 26, you should already know what you want in life...<br>  <br>  Just my thought, no hard feeling,,,,|`|RCWj5O8raa	Tell him how you feel.If he is really your boyfriend,he should at least call you no matter how busy! Otherwise DUMP HIM!!! There are PLENTY of great GUYS out there!!!!!|`|bvUCo55Baa	I'm going to be completely honest, there's not much you can do.  Unless you start hanging around his work all the time (which can come accross as needy), there's not much you can do.  It sounds to me like your lives are just not compatible.  Sometimes, schedules can completely dictate the fate of the relationship.  You might have the most amazing chemistry ever.....love eachother to death.  But if your schedules totally don't work, and you can't ever see each other, there's not much you can do.<br>  <br>  Before you completely call things quits though, sit him down and really talk to him.  Tell him that you want to keep seeing him, and that you care about him.....but you don't know how to make it work with your schedules.  And then, ask him if he has any ideas.  Let him know you are really concerned, and bummed that you can't see him....and let him know that you are scared it might ruin the relationship.  But then, ask him what he thinks.  And ask him if he has any ideas.  The open communication might help you figure out a way to make it work!!!  Good luck!!!

HyqS3KFraa	You can go to OHIO BMV website and get the dimensions of the maneuverability test, and you can practice anywhere... school parking lots work well, or church parking lots whenever they're empty.  Just use your own cones, or anything you can find that works the same way.  When I took my test, I practiced at home (had a large driveway though) and just got the dimensions off the website, used my cousins cones that he used for Soccer in his yard! haha  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
3mAgM405aa	This off-line typing opportunity only applies to the U.S., Canada and Europe.<br>  <br>  If you are an accomplished typist - word processor and have recently visited your local 4-year university librarian, you can apply as a "certified" graduate typist, earning between $1.50 to $2.00 per page for typing a master or doctoral thesis. The librarian will ask the following questions in order to qualify you as a "certified" typist:<br>  <br>  (1) Are you familiar and have a working knowledge of Microsoft Word?<br>  <br>  (2) Are you able to set up section breaks along with appropriate placement of auto page numbering in the footer/header?<br>  <br>  (3) Are you familiar with setting up a scheme with emphasis on the proper use of auto numbering, such as 1., 1.1, (a), (i), etc.?<br>  <br>  (4) Do you have access to a scanner with built-in OCR sofware?<br>  <br>  (5) Do you have access to a high-speed laser quality printer?<br>  <br>  If you answer all the above questions in the affirmative, the librarian will provide you with a sample of the typing format template (i.e., margin settings, font selection, page set up, etc.) in order to complete these projects. <br>  <br>  The librarian will then place your name on a list of "certified" graduate typists. This "certified' list will be given to various department heads so that any graduate student seeking your services can easily contact you directly from this list.<br>  <br>  An average weekend income is about $300-$400 for two days of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

aMl9ybuMaa	If they're leather it should be fine. UK doormen tend to have issues with anything resembing a trainer or sports shoe so avoid white sneakers and converse. I think you should be ok in the Kenneth Coles.
TbiSBXclaa	The better approach is to ask if there is anything you can do. Offer condolences and let him know how sorry your are for his loss and that you care about how the family is doing.<br>  <br>  If he wants to open up he will.  Don't press the issue with too many questions. How he died is really unimportant right now.  Asking those types of questions turns the situation into being about you and not them. The focus needs to remain on him and his family needs. <br>  <br>  Be sensitive and supportive, not inquisitive and curious.|`|kA0uNL5iaa	Well it isnt really insensative. The friend just might not want to talk about it because it makes them sad. If you want to know you have to have patience. Just say "if you are too upset right now, just know that you can talk to me about it".|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	Let the friend know you fell sorry for them but let them decide how much to say.

OAKDx7TWaa	It's not easy to rent a car at that age, but it can be done.<br>  <br>  You can pretty much forget about renting from the major national car rental agencies, like Hertz, Avis, or Budget.  They usually have a minimum age of 24 or 25.  But *sometimes* if they have a lot of cars left over, they will make an exception.  That's rare, but it doesn't hurt to call.<br>  <br>  More likely, however, you will have to go to a local company.  Fortunately, there is a place to check online.  Car Rental Express represents a group of smaller car rental companies who will rent to students and other young drivers.  Check them out at <br>  <a href="http://www.carrentalexpress.com/student-young-drivers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carrentalexpress.com/student-...</a><br>  I just went there now, and they do have a company in Indianapolis you can rent from (Ace Rent A Car).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
