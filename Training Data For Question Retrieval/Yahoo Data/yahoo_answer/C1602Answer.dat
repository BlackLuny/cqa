UR1BsvQmaa	Decide how many cars you need - Contact the corporate sales dfepartments of top rentals like Avis, Budget, Alamo, Thrifty, Dollar etc and ask them for a proposal. Make sure they are aware that you are submitting this to all the others that you are asking. They will come back with a corporate deal  offer.<br>  <br>  As you have 250 at a conference also mention to them that you are prepared ( subject to your company boss agreement ) that your conference will include their promotional meterial etc at your conference ( You have probably seen this type of thing : Company Name Coference - Honolulu 2008 - Cars provided by xxxx ).<br>  <br>  But you need to speak to the right people in their corporate sales dept.<br>  <br>  Of course for so many people had you not though of buses ? <br>  A lot easier than cars. You could again contact bus companies sales departments. Moving people in buses also creates inter-action between people, gets people talking together as a team.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion is to contact the Conference Coordinator at whichever hotel/resort you are holding your conference and asking them also what deals they can arrange. <br>  I would guess you are already in contact with such a person for the hotel rooms, conference facilities etc.<br>  <br>  Those coordinators always have personal contacts and know where deals can be found. They should also be able to get you special deals for restaurant dinners / tours etc.|`|53FA3PSNaa	The same way you would for 2 people, though you may have to use more than one rental company .

Vj13f7zmaa	Legal, yes.  But much harder than you would imagine.  My wife and I used to do 1-2 week trips all year round where we lived off just what we had.  It is much harder than it seems when you are reading the Tom Brown books.  Spend 3 days in a hut with the rain pouring down and out of dry wood and your clothes are damp and you have no fire and it is 45 degrees... do that as an experiment and the whole idea of being Grizzly Adams loses its appeal quite fast.  There are people doing it.  But it isn't practical unless you are going to try to at least put up some kind of substantial shelter.  A tent ain't going to do it.  I do know an old fella that lives down by the beach in NC and he has been there many years.  He has a hut of sorts and seems to do okay most of the year.  |`|4763c53bc105a1e3cf645f23278fd2c6aa	Please re think this because living in the wilderness is not as easy as you may think?

GsqQ4UTnaa	$1000 should be more than enough. Bus ticket $180 plus housing $350(hotels can be found around $50 a night), food $270 (depending where you eat or if you make your own food $15-30 a day) cigs and booze are up to you. You can cut corners with food a bit if you like but for those 3 things it comes out to $800 giving you $200 for liquor and smokes. Have fun.

Avoid by any means any politican conversation, better avoid even talking for how things are in Turkey and how in Greece, details about financial crisis etc. Show you are not interested. <br>  2. Avoid people who came from the former Soviet Union (Russia or Georgia esp), even in your work or university. Just do it (don't ask why) and you won't lose.  <br>  3. Show respect to the women of your environment, don't treat them as if they were flowers -it's not necessary- treat them as if they were men, but more politely (don't swear in front of them f.ex.). <br>  4. Bewear that in Greece if a female colleague asks you to go for a coffee after work, this DOESN'T have to mean at all that she is getting on you. <br>  5. If you intend to invite people to your room/apt, it would be better not to hand Turkish flags everywhere (avoid nationalistic expressions). Greeks don't do it for their country (we hang flags only twice/3 times a year) and they won't feel very comfortable, I hope you understand. <br>  6. Avoid 'typical' and 'boring' expressions, such as 'we Greeks and Turks are resembling so much, we are alike' etc., you won't face any consequences but it's not in the Greek mentality to expect such expressions.<br>  <br>  You are welcome, enjoy your stay when you come. <br>  I'm very sure you'll find friends.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	Nationalists exist from both sides.<br>  But generally NO you won't face any problem<br>  <br>  Greece and Turkey have signed a tourism-help protocol 3 years ago and this have already worked.<br>  <br>  (I have even seen Turkish vacation spots in TV)<br>  <a href="http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&folder=361&article=18880" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/Cont...</a>|`|PV1GN6wNaa	Absolutely no. There are some nationalists, but these are small groups. Generally greek people are friendly towards Turks, and the majority of Greeks desire peace between the two countries. Fear not and say openly where you are from - no problem!|`|AA11697378	No. This not true, greeks are nice people, Times have change, go enjoy your holiday there, have a nice time|`|LiItrPvraa	Yes it is.<br>  Be careful and don't tell them you Turk.<br>  <br>  @ for your own sake, make your own decision and follow your own feelings.<br>  Just be aware of the people who do tell everybody how safe is their city, state or country.<br>  <br>  Obviously they don't read the Black Chronicle and daily police reports.<br>  <br>  I do.

I mean that every Greek is sad and perhaps angry about issues between Greece and Turkey, like Cyprus and others, but on a personal level among people you will find that Greeks will be very friendly towards you. Sure if you tell someone that Cyprus is Turkish or that the Aegean is Turkish then they will not agree with you, lol, but if things are kept on a personal level you will make good friends in Greece.
1Vih78dZaa	I can't recommend particular brands or models, but what you're looking for is a device that's rated to work with 220 Volts, 50 Hz. These days, many electrical appliances (those bought in Europe, anyway) from manufacturers like Braun will work with both the USA's 120V 60Hz electrical supply as well Europe's 220V 50Hz electricity. Sometimes there's a switch you need to move, but sometimes it's automatic.<br>  <br>  I should imagine, however, that many electrical devices sold in the USA will work only with US electricity.<br>  <br>  You'll also need to bring an adaptor that will allow your American style plug to actually connect to the power available in a Greek wall socket. It's possible to get universal travel adaptors that will work in most parts of the world. However, bear in mind that these just allow the electrical connection to be made; they do NOT convert European 220 Volt electricity to 120 Volts, so using one of these to plug in an American appliance designed to work on the lower voltage will probably result in a loud bang and a lot of smoke (and possibly very frizzy hair if you're holding the wrong bit of the straighteners!).|`|aCILl7ctaa	Your straightener will most likely not work in Europe.<br>  <br>  You can easily find a converter in most hardware shops, or you could just wait till you actually get to Europe and pick one up, they are pretty common.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun over there.|`|fnvjovjUaa	Of course it will, but you need to buy an outlet converter. You can find it pretty much anywhere. Any electronic store, or any store that will carry things for when you travel, sometimes bed bath and beyond has them, target, radio shack, best buy..etc..

UR1BsvQmaa	You can find vacation rentals and probably find places to sleep 12, but they may well not have all the facilities you want. If you want something 4 star Mariner's Club Key Largo  has 3 bedroom town homes with Jacuzzi tubs, only about 5 minutes from John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, so you could take some 3 or 3 bedroom places. You would get 4 star facilities though.<br>  <a href="http://www.res99.com/hotel/10006005-10000756O.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.res99.com/hotel/10006005-1000...</a><br>  <br>  Key Largo Resort at Manatee Bay perhaps an option<br>  <br>  I think you have to decide between a vacation rental style home or a 4 star resort that has large suites/family apartments plus large pool etc like Mariner's Club. Vacationrentals.com might be a help.

6474a2196078e988256cf2503f6ad48faa	?Pero claro, linda ratita! La luna es de queso, del más rico de todos los quesos que puedan existir en el universo. Es un queso hecho con una gran cantidad de ingredientes misteriosos: un poco de magia, un poco de amor, una mirada de ensue?o, varias lluvias de estrellas... y muchos otros ingredientes que solo se encuentran en el corazón de aquellos que todavía tienen esperanza.<br>  <br>  Lo triste es que muchas de las personas que viven en la Tierra, están convencidas que la luna es un desierto rocoso, con cráteres y piedras que apenas reflejan la luz del sol. Incluso esa teoría está apoyada por la Nasa, que le dijo a sus astronautas que, al regresar de sus viajes exploratorios en la década del 70, le informaran que nuestra luna de queso en realidad era una gran roca muerta.<br>  <br>  Pero la verdad es otra, muy distinta.<br>  <br>  Tanto los rusos como los estadounidenses querían apoderarse de la luna de queso. Sabían que si lograban llegar y apoderarse de tanto queso, podrían llegar a ser ricos, tan solo vendiendo queso. <br>  <br>  Los yanquis llegaron primero, y lo tuvieron que hacer durante una noche de luna llena. ?Y sabes porque? Simplemente porque no podían explicarse las fases de la luna. No estaban seguros porque rayos la luna aparecía y desaparecía en el cielo, suponían que tenía que ver con la posición del sol... pero no, los astronautas descubrieron aterrorizados la verdad.<br>  <br>  Cuando la luna está llena, es un queso redondo, hermoso, completo, feliz. Inspira a los enamorados, a los poetas,  a los locos... y también a los hombres lobo. Los bosques están iluminados, y sus senderos son seguros y hasta mágicos. Las hadas y las luciérnagas bailan alrededor de la luna. Y a veces, el queso está empa?ado, anunciando lluvia... dicen que es la famosa "luna de agua".<br>  <br>  Pero este queso redondo poco a poco se va convirtiendo en un queso menguante. Va desapareciendo... y fué allí cuando los astronautas vieron avanzar sobre la luna una ordenada fila de ratones lunáticos como queso. Estos roedores, aunque son muy simpáticos, se devoran la luna en apenas siete días. Van avanzando, como legiones romanas, todos juntos, en una gran fila, de polo a polo... y van mordisqueando la luna, hasta hacerla desaparecer. <br>  <br>  Cuando lo hacen, satisfechos, se van a dormir a las estrellas cercanas, para poder hacer la digestión.<br>  <br>  Por suerte, todas las hadas que danzan bajo la luna llena, suben al cielo, y comienzan a dibujar con sus varitas mágicas una luna nueva.<br>  <br>  Entonces, cuando los ratones  se van a dormir, un arco iris mágico se forma entre la Tierra y el lugar donde desapareció la luna. Por ese arco iris, suben al cielo todas las hadas del mundo que aman danzar bajo la luna llena junto a las luciérnagas, y comienzan a dibujarla con sus varitas mágicas.

5f1d6c54abf79c4425783ea11d54f55faa	Hola. Estuve en Iguazú en enero, por 10 días. Mis consejos: la hotelería es mucho más económica del lado brasilero que del argentino, y los hoteles son de mejor categoría, al igual que las comidas ( diferencia de un 40 % aproximadamente ). Además de las excursiones clásicas a Cataratas del lado argentino ( no dejés de realizar "La gran aventura": paseo en gomón acercándote mucho a los saltos San Martín y los Tres Mosqueteros y luego recorrido en camión por el espesor de la Selva, precio $ 90,00 por persona para argentinos ) y del lado brasilero, y el paseo a la represa de Itaipú, podés ir al Parque de las Aves del lado brasilero, domnde vas a ver un montón de especies diferentes, vale la pena. Del lado argentino está Aripuca, que es un lugar con árboles gigantes, pero sólo si te sobra tiempo. Del lado brasilero hay un paseo en helicóptero sobrevolando las Cataratas por 10 minutos, al módico precio de u$s 70,00 ( no muy apto para argentinos clase media ) y no es ecológico. Todo depende el tiempo que te quedes en el lugar, si vas por 4 días, no te va a sobrar el tiempo. Si sos argentina, al día siguiente de ir al Parque del lado argentino, la entrada te sale la mitad si la hacés sellar antes de irte..........y la belleza del lugar da para ir más de un día. Yo ya fui 4 veces a Cataratas. Esta vez lo hice para que mis hijas de 14 y 12 a?os las conozcan.|`|7a73cf38d48a70bafc1940d573ba18bfaa	DEL LADO BRASILE?O, TIENES FOZ DO IGUAZú, QUE TIENE UNA MARAVILLOSA VISTA HACIA LAS CATARATAS... DEL LADO ARGENTINO, IGUAZú TIENE BUENOS RESTAURANTES, Y DEL LADO PARAGUAYO, TIENES LA CIUDAD FRONTERIZA LLAMADA "STROESSNER", PRECISAMENTE EN HONOR DE ALFREDO STROESSNER, QUIEN GOBERNó A ESE PAíS POR MáS DE TRES DéCADAS...

Te pueden ofrecer ir al Paraguay a Ciudad del Este. Se supone que es un paseo de compras, pero en realidad es horrible, está muy sucio y los precios no son convenientes, mala calidad, demasiada gente y cruzar el puente de regreso a Iguazú puede llevar todo el día.<br>  Si tienes tiempo de ir a las ruinas de San Ignacio es muy recomendable pero no es cerca, puede llevar toda una ma?ana, pero es muy lindo. <br>  Algo maravilloso de hacer es ver si para semana santa aún hay luna llena, pues hacen el paseo por las cataratas a la luz de la luna, hay que anotarse con tiempo y depende también de que no esté nublado.<br>  También se puede ir al Casino, aunque no es muy grande y en Buenos Aires tenemos mejores y más glamorosos.<br>  En las Cataratas no te pierdas la visita a la Isla San Martin, el traslado en bote está incluido en la entrada, sólo que el río debe estar lo suficiente profundo para navegar, tampoco si está muy crecido se puede ir. Pero esa es la mejor vista de las cataratas.<br>  También te pueden ofrecer el Safari. No se ve nada, dicen que hay monos, aves, etc, etc, pero NO SE VE NADA, sólo te pican los mosquitos.|`|601da9812092f47519f911e8a038bd1faa	IR AL LADO BRASILE?O, AHI TIENES FOZ DO IGUAZú QUE TIENE UNA PRECIOSA VISTA A LAS CATARATAS...<br>  DEL LADO DE ARGENTINA IGUAZú TIENE UN BUEN PUERTO DUTY FREE, Y DEL LADO PARAGUAYO TIENES LA CIUDAD FRONTERIZA LLAMADA STROESNER, PERO NO TE RECOMIENDO ESA CIUDAD.

Remember clothing etc is very cheap in India so don't take items with you that you may not use and for things like casual wear, t-shirts etc you can do boubt buy very cheaply in India.<br>  Shopping in India is cheap and fun !<br>  <br>  There is an old saying<br>  <br>   " When you travel take half the baggage and double the money" !!

f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola.  I live here in Cabo and can help.<br>  Start of April weather is quite nice.  Not screaming hot but not cool either.  The nights start to warm up and April/May is the driest time of year.  Spring break usually doesn't really wind down until the 3rd week in April, so you will find a party atmosphere most days.<br>  Warm Beach - check<br>  Warm Weather - check<br>  How is the beach - well in Cabo we have just under 100 different beaches, so it will depend what beach you plan on going to!  This usually depends on where you are staying at.  Most resorts have their own beach.  The Pacific ocean is a little more rough than the Carribean side.  It can have an undertow, and sometimes you cannot swim.  Kinda like Australia.  If you go to certain beaches in Cabo, they are more protected and therefore easier and safer to swim at.  Most of the resorts in Cabo are aware of this, and therefore their pool areas are spectacular to make up the difference!<br>  <br>  Have a great holiday down here!

C6EnMKz1aa	Studies dating back to 1944 into house loss from bush fires show that there is no correlation between house loss and construction materials. Most houses (something like 85%) are lost from ember attack and not radiant heat or direcct flame contact.<br>  <br>  What is important is provision of an asset protection zone, maintenance of the building and knowledge of what to do during a bushfire on the part of the occupants.<br>  <br>  Asset protection zones don't need to be particularly big to remove the threat of radiant heat or direct flame contact burning down a house. The size of an asset protection zone should be determined on the basis of the vegetation type and slope to the house. <br>  <br>  Embers however can travel kilometres ahead of a fire. So it is important to seal gaps around the house to prevent entry of embers.<br>  <br>  Occupants need to know to use their house as a refuge when the fire front passes through and not to panic and try to evacuate at the last minute. Many deaths occur as a result of people trying to flee and there are examples of this where people have died in their carsbut the home actually survived the fire (Eyre Peninsular South Australia a few years ago).<br>  <br>  If people dont want to stay they need to leave well ahead of the fire. The chances of a house burning down though increases significantly if there is no one there to defend it from the ember attack before and after the fire front comes through.|`|CLjiev9Xaa	Wooden houses are safe in the bush if you take sensible precautions.   Clear a firebreak around the property and have no overhanging branches over your home.     Regular controlled burns will help clear the bush of fuel and slow any natural fires (and they will occur).     Use common sense and be safe.|`|WnHPRcizaa	NO! The only way you would have a chance and a VERY good chance is to build your house out of stone and or brick. Fire usually can not burn through stone. If I were to choose to live in the bush (which I won't cause I like the city) I would build my house out of stone!|`|OYYYNCyCaa	if they lived 50 klms maybe but how far do you want to live away from nature<br>  <br>  people were surrounded by the bush fires and were unable to escape|`|uG8yLnUWaa	Embers from Burning gum trees can travel for kilometers to start more fires and set fire to buildings etc. I fire as intense as the recent Victorian ones are unstoppable and unpredictable. They can change direction in an instant and move so fast you probably couldn't out run them in your car to escape. There is talk now of homes and or towns having fire shelters built for people to take refuge in.<br>  <br>  But I think you are right to some degree. Sometimes people need to worry a little less about being "green" and knock over trees and create fire breaks a bit further away from their homes. i will be most interested to see the recommendations put forward when the Royal Commission (not sure if that is the correct terminology) into these fires in completed. There are many local government bodies that don't allow the clearing of trees in some cases. Stuff like that needs to be investigated.|`|VLCUDZlcaa	It doesnt matter what material you house is built from, if you live in fire-danger zone then its a matter of applying appropriate safety measures to protect your house.

AA11589437	1. The building regulation (kanonismos ths polykatoikias), which has been drafted when the building was built and it must accompany the contracts and the "systash orizontiou idiokthsias", states what percentage you have to pay for the heating when you have your heaters closed and the apt. is empty. Usually it is 30-40%. Both answers above are wrong in this, one says you pay nothing for it the other says you pay it all, no, you must pay 30-40% or whatever the kanonismos ths polykatoikias says, but you must close the heaters in your apartment in the presence of the diaxeirisths.<br>  2. The elevator must be serviced every month.<br>  3. You do pay for the cleaner and all other expenses. You are only excepted from paying the 70-60% of heating.<br>  4. You pay normally the electricity bills etc, unless you stop your connection with the electric company, but then you may have some procedures to be connected again.|`|AA11697378	I have an apartment there too, I have to pay the koinoxrista every month, that includes: Heating, even though no one is living there, i have to pay some for the truck to come for the supply, and what they pay for the corridor's expenses, like the electricity, the Cleaner, if there is something wrong with the elevator everyone has to pay.the percentage go by how many tetragonika you have.

I'm glad someone else recognizes "Houston, we've got a problem."<br>  <br>  Every country that currently has nuclear capability needs to remain stable, and unstable countries seeking capability need to be prevented from acquiring them.  There has already been a call out for a nuclear suicide bomber from the Islamic extremists.<br>  <br>  I think most of the West is involved in the economic crisis and backstabbing each other over it or some other lame thing not paying attention to what the Islamics are doing and how vulnerable we are.  We've got some pretty deceptive and violent opportunists out there that want to see the demise of the West and making a move for global hegemony.<br>  <br>  They aren't just doing it in Pakistan and Afganistan but they're doing it in our own backyards too! We better get our sh*t together or not even Houston can save us.<br>  <br>  America sent more troops to Afganistan.  We can't do this alone there really are too many of them and it's tough terrain.  We purposely sent envoy and asked Europe for help but they're too busy or whatever lame excuse they gave I don't know but I'm horribly ticked off at them about it. In WW2 everyone had to fight and the time is now not later to avoid mass casualty again.  It's just not enough troops we need more. Europe didn't recognize Hitler early on they're dropping the ball on this one too.  And as far as it being fought just in Afganistan that is a misperception of reality there are so many fronts on the war on terror it's actually global now.<br>  <br>  JD I'm not afraid of the terrorists I retain my hope against them.

It rises to about 7,900 ft (2,410 m) at Mt. Hagios Ilias (Mt. St. Elias or Prophitis Elias). The mountain is named after Taygete. It was used by the Spartans to execute criminals and the deformed. In Byzantine times and up until the 19th century, the mountain was known as Pentedaktylos (Greek for five-fingered). The mountain range includes the prefectures of Arcadia, Laconia and Messenia.<br>  <br>  The highest peak of the mountain is known for displaying the approximate shape of a pyramid. A church of the prophet Elias (προφ?τη? Ηλ?α?) is located near the peak. European walking route E4 also leads there.<br>  <br>  The valley of the Evrotas River lies to the east, while the Ionian Sea lies to the south and west along with the Gulf of Kalamata or the Messenian Gulf and Arcadia to the north.<br>  <br>  Almost all of the Evrotas valley, the Parnon Mountains and half of Laconia can be seen from the eastern slope. The western slopes panorama includes Kalamata and the eastern half of Messenia. Most of the southwestern part of Arcadia can also be seen.<br>  Part of Skoteini Plevra<br>  <br>  The central part of the mountain range is commonly called "Skoteini Plevra" which means "the dark side" because the villages that are in the Taygetus don't receive as much sunshine, especially in the morning and the pre-dusk hours. Much of the area is forested and in higher areas, deforested with grasslands, meadows and flowers. The area receives sunshine only during the afternoon hours. The length is about 4 to 5 km and the width is approximately 1 km.<a href="http://images.google.gr/images?hl=el&q=Taygetos&btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7+%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD&gbv=2Alagonia" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.gr/images?hl=el&q=T...</a> (Ancient Greek: ?λαγον?α) was a town of Laconia, ancient Greece, near the Messenian frontier, belonging to the Eleuthero-Lacones, containing temples of the Greek gods Dionysus and Artemis. This town was 30 stadia distant from Gerenia, but its site is unknown,[1] although it may be synonymous with the modern district within Kalamata, in the prefecture of Messenia.<br>  <br>  The city was named after the mythological Alagonia, a daughter of Zeus and Europa.Artemisia or Artemissia (Greek: Αρτεμισ?α, older pronunciation: ar-tem-IZH-a) is a mountainous village in the municipality of Kalamata, Messinia prefecture, Greece. As of 2001, it had a population of 180 for the village and the municipal district and sits at 860 m above sea level. Many of its residents live during the summer months.<br>  <br>  Until 1927, it was known as Tsernitsa or Tzernitsa.

I was astonished (this was only one time and most Americans know better than this mind you!) Also, they can tell we have an accent very quickly. Many are also interested in people from other lands, so thats good!<br>  <br>  Oh by the way- make sure you dont use any Canadian coins down there (not like loonies and toonies- but pennies, quarters and nickles and dimes) For whatever reason, they wont take them even though we dont even care if we get theres in a handful of change! Weird I know. <br>  <br>  Overall Americans are good people who were just never taught much about Canada like Canadians are taught about the American system.|`|xLbbK41faa	I visit the States at least once a year, and can honestly say I love it. Sure there are huge differences between the States and Canada but for the most part I love the  American culture. I'm always grateful to live in Canada, but I think I could adjust to living in the US just as well. I find the people, especially in the West are very similar to Canadians...laid back, down to earth...educated(hate to say it). Of course when you travel to some of the small cities you really feel like your on a different planet, in some parts, they are sooooo far behind which is hard to believe. I went to a gas station that had a big sign saying "now hiring, starting @ $4.75 per hour...yikes! Can't imagine!<br>     All in all I love being a Canadian in the States, I have never  had any problems, and find they are always interested to know more about Canada. I learn something new on all my trips and teach them about Canada as well...always good times!|`|PcP6eXdtaa	Im from the US. People are different everywhere. Most of the people here are nice and average citizens just like up in Canada. But then again, there the Racist KKK members, the biker gangs, and the gangs such as Bloods/latin kings/crips. Overall its a great country filled with Good food, good tourist attractions, great views, fun times, and mostly kind people. But honestly, it depends on what part you go to. I live in Massachusetts, and if you go to the city, its a total different place from the country. Hope I helped.|`|IK8VW4FZaa	I have been to western NY and Pittsburg.  <br>  <br>  The highways are great and people follow the rules of the road.  Larger police presence than in Canada.  The people are always friendly, especially if they know you are Canadian...people are also fatter on average.  Very patriotic, which I respect.<br>  <br>  I drove to Pittsburg and when I got there I became lost looking for where the Penguins play.  I drove through some places that I have never seen in Toronto.  All the people were black and the area was very run down.  Slums I guess.  We have bad places in Toronto, but not what I saw in Pittsburg.  And our poverty seems to be less discriminating, but still the blacks and natives have it the worse, but not like what I saw in Pittsburg.  It was like segregation.|`|azypqsphaa	yes, i hate it there, I always return to Canada to stay the night if I can...and then drive back over the next day..|`|2LcyVsrlaa	I lived there for 5 years while I was in university.  It was an amazing experience.  For the very, very most part, I loved it.  The country is so diverse, the people are so diverse and interesting.  The only thing was that they teased me mercilessly about being Canadian.  However, I did not take it lying down and teased back.  <br>  <br>  I missed Canadian candy (so my mother imported it for me) and I thought that American chocolate bars were kind of waxy and tasteless.  No Smarties to be had!  On the upside, there was an abundance of Cherry Cokes, and MMM!  We don't have those here.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, for the most part, the food was the same as here, so it was no big adjustment.<br>  <br>  I also really missed Air Farce and other CBC humour.  (This is, of course, the only part of the CBC worth watching!) Canadians have a much drier, much more political humour, while Americans' humour can sometimes be more "potty humour".<br>  <br>  However, winters were much more mild where I was, and I really liked that.  I am not a winter-lovin' gal.  Summers were hard to get used to--they were really hot!  Beaches in California are infinately better than Canadian beaches, though.<br>  <br>  The people were, for the most part, really friendly and nice.  Unless they were working in INS offices.  In that case, they were actually hired on their ability to be jerks and buttheads.  I think that Americans are pretty much like people anywhere.  They are mostly concerned about the stuff that goes on in their own homes, communities and States.  I think that's pretty common among Canadians too.  I'm more worried about what's going on in my province than what's happening in Nunavit, for example.<br>  <br>  Overall, a very good experience.  But I'm still a Canadian...be it ever so frozen, there's no place like home! :)

rgNP0Qo6aa	Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!|`|7upShB9Yaa	I'm currently doing laser hair removal treatments. The place I go to uses the gel that is used for ultra sounds. And it's kept in a refrigerator so it's cold when they put it on. I'm assuming that's what you are talking about. <br>  The place I go to is called American Laser Centers. They have several locations around Houston. You can go onto their website for that information. I will tell you that it's not cheap. However, they have different payment plan options if you need one. And I am very very happy with the results I have gotten so far. I'm not finished with all the treatments yet, but so far so good.<br>  Good luck!

Intrepid Travel leaps to mind.  (I had a very good experience with them in China.).  But airfare will not be included in any of the less expensive ones . . . taking planes is almost never the mode of transport when visiting adjacent countries inside Europe.  And no; I don't think any company at all will include the flights to/from your home country.<br>  <br>  As others may point out, it will be *far* cheaper to travel on your own.  There are lots of good reasons to do a group tours:  You have traveled alone in the past and did not like it; You are nervous about being by yourself in a strange country; you simply prefer the experience of traveling with other people; you want to make friends while traveling; and so on.  But if you're willing to go it alone, you will save tons of money, will have the freedom to stay as long (or as short) in each place as you want, and will not be forced to follow a pre-arranged plan.<br>  <br>  But that was not your question.  If you find that the longer tours are just too much money, then maybe do a shorter group tour, and once you have your 'feet wet,' take off by yourself once the group tour is over.  Europe is incredibly easy to navigate by yourself, and if you have basic English skills, you'll find loads of English-speaking locals in most of the places you're likely to get to on the trip you described.  <br>  <br>  One other advantage of the group tour is that--while it is usually quite rushed--you will be able to cram in a lot of sights and sites into a relatively short amount of time.  Not the best way to really get to know a country, in my opinion.  But for a first-time visit to a country, it definitely will give you a basic flavor, and will give you good ideas on where to go/avoid on a return trip.

Apartments can be 500~800 a month US, AFTER you have paid 1~6 months in advanced and signed at least a 2 year contract, though its harder for foreigners, but it is veery much possible and I know many people including myself that do it.

This talk of set-top digital boxes could lead you astray as a stronger signal is required for digital signals than for the older analogue broadcasts.<br>  <br>  The transmitting aerials are all on the top of the escarpment to the East of Perth (roughly at the top of Welshpool Road).|`|uG8yLnUWaa	Don't forget there are many suburbs of perth where you can't get mobile reception!!<br>  <br>  Go the set top box for sure.

kgBPU4xxaa	It depends on exactly where you will be and when you will be there. Lodging prices vary a lot here depending on what's going on. I stayed in a hotel close to Piazza San Marco for the opening weekend of Carnevale and the room cost 150 euro per night. Saturday, the same room was going for 400 euro a night for the 2nd weekend of Carnevale.<br>  <br>  You should generally be able to find hostels for less than $50 per night though.

You can find the Eu-rail Italy situations that fits you best. Travel within cities (public transportation) generally costs about one Euro. You'll have to pay somewhat more if you are leaving urban centers to reach outlying villages or towns.<br>  Hotels and such - the bigger the city the more expensive the (better) hotels will be. It is not easy to find a place to stay in Milan for 50 Euro for example unless it's a flop house. You may want to book your places to stay before going to Italy - at least for the major cities.<br>  Food - if you are on a budget then you could shop for some of your food in supermarkets and make sandwiches in your hotel room. You can even buy wine in a box (which means you don't even have to buy a cork screw!). Pizza in a restaurant will cost you anywhere from 8 to 16 Euro + beverage + cover.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Note that transportation in Venice costs 6 times more than anywhere else in Italy. If you want to save (some money) then buy a pass according to the amount of days you'll stay there).
kgBPU4xxaa	It depends on how large the one piece is, but it generally isn't too difficult to manage one piece here. A backpack is pretty easy too. I'd rather have a rollable bag than a duffel bag most of the time though. Many people use the trains for travel here and often there's baggage. Most of the people on the train Saturday had luggage and there were no issues storing it in the overhead racks. Sometimes you see people with huge, very heavy bags that they have trouble lifting onto the train, much less an overhead storage area. If you avoid that kind of overpacking, you shouldn't have much problem here.|`|jOM4bBMPaa	As long as you're able to pick that piece of luggage up to carry up stairs you should be okay.  I prefer to use a backpack so I have both hands free, but if you don't plan on being a frequent traveler to Italy (or Europe) you don't need to invest in a backpack.  The rolling luggage will work fine.|`|hT8vbWiDaa	One "rollable piece of luggage" is perfect. Just remember that the bigger it is the bigger the problem it will be to get on and off of trains, buses & the metro (subway / underground). If you go to Venice then you'll have to lug it over bridges.|`|896406d7dedb37c4ef791414e98ee7d9aa	Sure it would be. Some trains even have an area where you can leave your luggage. If you reach a station and you want to have a walk around without a luggage you can leave it at the luggage deposit

It's enough for me being Jewish to defend the Jewish people, being an American to defend Americans, and being a Westerner to defend the West.  I just try to defend everyone else too but we're not the only people in this world it takes some more help, an action and not just good wishes.  It's concerted effort by all to stop the extremists all over the place from killing themselves and the rest of us with them. They are homocidal/suicidal maniacs and they're hellbent on killing us all.  The West is invovled on a war on terror, but we seem to be missing some troops on this ongoing battle.  Perhaps if we had more western involvement, then there wouldn't be so many people dieing.<br>  <br>  FYI to the man with the bloody Arab baby pictures above.  Who's to say that Israel killed those babies when the Arabs themselves are such a bloody violent people that put their civilians in harms way and don't even care?  Israel defends herself and any civilian killed is an innocent casualty of urban war, not purposely targeted.  You only show bloody baby pictures so you can go by people's emotions and cause them to outrage against Israel.  You only perpetuate the war and the continuing of hostilities by not addressing the real problems.  Where is outrage when something like this happens? There are plenty of stories of unarmed people dieing in "Palestine." Their whole society is so corrupt they kill each other, where is the OUTRAGE? <br>  <br>  June 2007 598 Dead and 2,900 Injured as a result of infighting --------><br>  "This conflict over authorities between the two movements was interpreted on the ground in an armed conflict that continued over 15 months. In this conflict, 350 Palestinians, including 20 children and 18 women, were killed, and at least 1,900 others were wounded, including dozens who sustained permanent disabilities. The internal fighting was also accompanied by an escalation in the state of lawlessness, which took the lives of 248 Palestinians and wounded at least 1,000 others.<br>  <br>  his testimony to PCHR, another demonstrator who was wounded stated: 55 “At approximately 11:00 on Wednesday, 13 June 2007, a peaceful demonstration was organized near the police station in al-Shojaeya neighborhood in the east of Gaza City. The number of demonstrators was initially 1,000, but it increased until we arrived near the Palestinian Legislative Council. Members of the National Security Forces attempted to prevent us from reaching al-‘Abbas intersection, but we insisted to reach it. When we arrived there, an exchange of fire erupted between the two sides. We saw members of the National Security Forces exchanging fire with militants positioned in al-Ghefari apartment building to the west. The demonstration dispersed and we had shelters behind walls. When the exchange of fire stopped, we gathered again. When we were sitting near al-Mis’hal Cultural Center, I saw one of the demonstrators, Mohammed ‘Adas,  (19, M, Civilian) being shot dead to the head. The demonstration dispersed in the area.  In order for us to be able to go homes, we had to go back and cross the intersection. We took the risk and attempted to cross the intersection. We were fired at, so we had to lie on  the ground. Two of us were wounded. Shadi al-‘Ejla (21, M, Civilian) attempted to pull one  of them, but he was wounded by gunshot to the head. I attempted to pull the other person  who was wounded, but I felt that something penetrated my back and I saw my chest bleeding.  Soon after, Taghreed al-‘Eila (31, F, Civilian, later deceased from wound) attempted to pull al-‘Ejla, <br>  but she was shot.”<br>  <br>  Not enough OUTRAGE for you? Then read more, not even homes and hospitals are safe in "Palestine"<br>  <br>  At approximately 23:45 on Monday, 11 June 2007, a member of the Muhsen clan opened fire inside the reception department at Shifa Hospital, in protest to the killing of a woman and a child relating to him inside their house, in the context of the clashes between Fatah and Hamas movements. 42 As a result, ‘Abdul Raziq ‘Ali Madi, 40, was seriously wounded by a gunshot to the head. He died from his wound on 24 June 2007.<br>  <br>  How about children in their backyard, hit by rocket? They don't just shoot rockets at Israel, they shoot rockets at each other! OUTRAGED?<br>  <br>  In another crime, 3 children were wounded, when a home-made rocket hit the backyard of their house during armed clashes between Fatah and Hamas movements in Deir al-Balah town in the central Gaza Strip. In his testimony to PCHR, Haitham Mousa Duhaish al-Zrai’ei, 16, stated: “At approximately 10:30 on Tuesday, 12 June 2007, my bother Mohammed, 8, my sisters Samia and Ghadeer, 12 and 18 respectively, and I were in the backyard of our house, when we heard a heavy explosion near us. I was extremely scared as I saw my bother and sisters lying on the ground and crying that they were attacked by an aircraft. I could see that they were bleeding. I rushed into the house and called an ambulance. Our neighbors came and took my brother and sisters into the house. Mohammed was hit by shrapnel to the right leg; Samia was wounded by shrapnel to the right side; and Ghadeer was wounded by shrapnel to the left side. An ambulance soon arrived and evacuated them to al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. They received medical treatment and left the hospital in two hours. According to police officers who arrived at the scene, the explosion resulted from a home-made rocket.”<br>  <br>  And how about babies in their mother's wombs dieing by Arab hands, where is the OUTRAGED?<br>  <br>  Earlier on the same day, an activist of the ‘Izziddin al-Qassam Brigades was driving a jeep accompanied by his young daughter, his brother’s wife who was pregnant and 2 cousins. The jeep came under fire in Mohammad al-Durra Street near the Special Police and Preventive Security stations in the Gizan al-Najjar area in the south of Khan Yunis. All the occupants of the vehicle were hit by gunshots. Special Police vehicles took the victims to Nasser Hospital and the European Hospital in Khan Yunis. Reem Shehada al-Ghalban, a 28-year-old pregnant woman, who was hit with several gunshots all over her body, and ‘Attiya Ibrahim ‘Attiya al-Ghalban, 20, who was hit by several gunshots to the upper body, were both pronounced dead shortly after admission into the hospital.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pchrgaza.org/files/Reports/English/pdf_spec/Gaza%20Conflict%20-%20Eng%209%20october..pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pchrgaza.org/files/Reports/En...</a><br>  --------------------<br>  Edit to Moneymax:  Thank you for adding that brutal video it is very important for people to realize who our enemy is.

Newcastle should be a bit less expensive, especially accommodation.<br>  <br>  A 2-bedroom flat costs ￡500-600+. Council tax is usually another ￡100. Electricity, gas, phone and internet should be about ￡100-150 (less in warmer months). Food costs depend on personal habits, but I think you would need at least ￡150 per adult. Transportation depends on whether you drive or take buses. Public transport costs about ￡35 for a month card.<br>  <br>  To live comfortably, you would need a minimum salary of at least ￡25K per year.

PV1GN6wNaa	There are taxis in Crete - ask the taxi driver to put on the meter. You pay what is written, except if you carry luggage, in which case you may be asked to pay 1-2E more. The prices should be written in front of the front seat, in Greek and English - do insist on them! <br>  Samaria is an experience not to be missed. The city of Irakleio is not something special really - as Chania is, which you should not miss. Go for sure to Knossos. Good luck!|`|TzjkajKFaa	take a look here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sitiacrete.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitiacrete.org</a><br>  <br>  yassou|`|ON476VItaa	Hi, Crete is an amazing island. If you are staying in the East of the island (Agios Nikolaos) then definitely visit Knossos, ensure you wear comfortable footwear, sunscreen/hat & take water as can be very hot in the summer! Elounda is a nice resort to visit with the island of Spinalonga. Lasshiti plateau is where you will see windmills and nice scenery. If you think about staying in the west a good resort is Rethymon, it has a wonderful beach, lovely harbour, good night life & a wide selection of restaurants. From Rethymon you can visit Chania (a must see - great waterpark too) Lake Kournas - Souda Bay (war cemetery) Samaria Gorge (you must be fit to do this, good walking shoes essential & stamina, not a walk in the park but definitely a great experience) Arkadi monestry, Georgorpolis (nice village with character church) Episkopi (village with waterfalls) Paleohora (see the pelican)  Frangokastello Castle, Plakias (seaside resort) Matala (hippy caves) So so much to see & do. Car hire is a good option.
f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	For your visit Union Square is probably the best place to stay. There are lots of good restaurants, shops, theaters and clubs in the Union Square area. It is centrally located with lots of public transportation options and within walking distance of most of the tourist areas. <br>  <br>   Driving in the city can be confusing for visitors and parking is difficult and expensive so forgoing the rental car is a good idea. Muni offers multi day passes that are good for buses, trolley, light rail and the cable cars [unique experience but $5 per ride].<br>  <a href="http://www.sfmuni.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfmuni.com</a><br>  <br>   Joie de Vivre <a href="http://www.jdvhotels.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jdvhotels.com</a> has several hotels in the Union Square area in different price points.

There are museums, lots of shopping, restaurants, etc. My favorite district that I've seen so far has been Haight/Ashbury. A lot of people I know love the Macy's (the store. seriously, sounds weird, but it's amazing). There are art museums to see, the tea garden & surrounding park, the marina, the trolleys, Chinatown. Go visit Alcatraz, walk across the Golden Gate Bridge, etc.<br>  San Francisco is one of my favorite cities. You'll love it.|`|inOXaZzIaa	There are so many things to do in San Francisco this summer you won't have enough time to do them all. Believe me you won't be bored. You can go to <br>  <a href="http://www.discovering-sanfrancisco.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discovering-sanfrancisco.com</a> <br>  They have  must see sites and events calendar for everything that's going on in the months ahead.<br>  There's a lot of free events the like festivals during the summer. which you and your family can enjoy. <br>  There's over 1600 restaurants so you won't have problem finding a place to eat.<br>   If you're flying into San Francisco. don't rent a car hotels charge $40 TO $50 a night for parking. Public parking runs about $20 a day. in the parking meters are 25 cents for 10 minutes. That's if you can find the parking spot.<br>  San Francisco has the best transportation system in the United States and its very inexpensive.|`|AA11500132	SF is small, for a city, so anywhere is in reasonable reach.<br>  <br>  I liked the Orchard Hotel on Bush St near the Powell cable car routes.<br>  or just a short walk down to Union square for trollies (trams) to the Embarcardo or out to Golden gate park/Haight ashbry; or up & across to China town then down through little italy to Pier 17. or up to grace cathedral & nob hill. <br>  get the travel passes for your stay then just hop on and off the trollies/buses.<br>  Seaplane rides are great way to see the place (pick-up from Fishermans wharf). Plenty to fill a week or more. good food<br>  <br>  Depends on weather in summer likely to be foggy & cool, but could be hot.|`|ymSVKjBpaa	golden gate bridge..

If you are behind the desk there is no real problem with it.  If you are out where people are like the breakfast area then you need to have your shoes on.  There are several reasons for this and here are just a few.  You could drop something on your foot and get hurt or step on something that could hurt you.  It is also against health code for you to be in your socks whiled working in the food prep area. It is unsanitary. It is also unprofessional to be barefoot in public. I hope this helps.

dpKntiZoaa	Unfortunately there is an element who do indeed only associate Amsterdam with drugs and prostitutes.... so you get the "all drugs are legal" story from those people, and bizarely that "everyone" wants to smoke marijuana..... hands up those who enjoy Amsterdam without smoking and you will see it is not "everyone".<br>  <br>  Also, no drugs are legal.  Weed/marijuana is tolerated under given conditions and other drugs are absolutely illegal and acted upon<br>  <br>  Normally it is the ones who are interested in drugs and/or prostitutes anyway that form this association with Amsterdam and then perpetuate it.<br>  <br>  Actually Amsterdam is so much more, and fortunately many tourists also recognise this and come for this.  For example there are 50+ museums alone in Amsterdam, more shopping than you could do in a lifetime, art & science, architecture, science attractions, many tourist attractions such as the Anne Frank house, a zoo, a great nightlife, lots of different cuisines and fun places to eat & drink..... well I could go on! <br>  <br>  Of course it is not to rule out the stereotypes.  Actually it can be interesting wandering around the red light district.  At least then you can see it first hand and some of the stigma usually disappears.  Same for coffeeshops - if people want to go and have a quiet smoke, then why not experience it? - emphasis on the "quiet".<br>  <br>  It is the gangs (of usually youngish guys) that come to Amsterdam intent on getting plastered (drunk) and then mix that with getting zombified on weed - and then start touring around.  They are usually asking for trouble and quiet frankly are a pain in the (you know where).  These are the ones which give a bad reputation, and the ones that locals also dispair of.  <br>  <br>  On a Saturday night, I have personally dodged my fair share of them!<br>  <br>  So I hope that people come, visit Amsterdam, enjoy what is on offer (whatever their tastes) in a relaxed manner, and those that want to cause problems or get of their heads, - stay at home.   This to me is more of an issue than the fact that you can buy marijuana/weed in Amsterdam, and if I was not a local - this would be the thing that would put me off re-visiting again.  However, this is not unique to Amsterdam either in my experience.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Unfortunatley, yes & maybe that explains why the Dutch people there are so rude to foreigners.  It's a shame as it's a beautiful city with those great canals & riverboats, the bicycles everywhere & the architecture & houseboats.  It does seem to be a very seedy place because of the drugs with a lot of Rastafarians living there who looked really sleazy.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Yes Amsterdam is perceived a drug tourism destination and infact is probably the biggest drug tourism destination in the world. But ofcourse that's just one side. There is the Amsterdam of drugs and sex that most tourists come for (or atleast try once), but there is also the Amsterdam of art, architecture, fashion and high culture. Not to mention parts of the club and party scene don't involve or welcome drugs. It does seem that some tourists are discouraged to visit by the drug image, but in my opinion it's like choosing not to visit London because you think the London eye was a bad idea. <br>  <br>  Also in terms of absolute numbers, probably more people are encouraged to visit by the drug thing than are discouraged by it. Relatively few people who seek other aspects of Amsterdam are discouraged by the drug thing because it's pretty easy to avoid if you choose to.|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	A lot of backpackers do go there for the drugs.  If you mention Amsterdam to most people, they assume that's what you're going there for.  But I don't think that it's reputation keeps other tourists away - certainly lots of tourists visit Amsterdam for its museums, architecture, Anne Frank house, etc. rather than drugs or sex.|`|17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	DISCOURAGE???<br>  <br>  <br>  more like ENCOURAGE<br>  <br>  everyone wants to smoke pottt, why not do it legally

It's as if you are advocating sex with minors.<br>  <br>  It is not okay to have sex with kids because minors are easily influenced, corrupted, affected and are most vulnerable.  Therefore there are laws designed to protect minors.  Understandably, 12 years is very young.  Arguably, by 15, they may know enough about the birds and the bees.    Even so, a definite targe age must be provided, therefore, in Singapore's case,  16 years and above is the legal age you can have sex with someone.<br>  <br>  The police arrest her because it's against the law.  <br>  <br>  Semen quality is irrelevant if it was just for sex. She could just have sex with college students and men in their 20's if she wants pregnancy by sex..<br>  <br>  Your last question seems to imply that a woman is incapable of raping a boy.  It's possible, either by statutory rape or abuse.|`|PDotv2Hsaa	No need to repeat, we hear you loud and clear.<br>  <br>  It's illegal, plain and simple because the boy is underaged.

9R8uYHcPaa	A family had twin boys whose only resemblance to each other was<br>  their looks. If one felt it was too hot, the other thought it<br>  was too cold. If one said the TV was too loud, the other claimed<br>  the volume needed to be turned up. Opposite in every way, one<br>  was an eternal optimist, the other a doom & gloom pessimist.<br>  <br>  Just to see what would happen, on the twins' birthday their<br>  father loaded the pessimist's room with every imaginable toy and<br>  game. The optimist's room he loaded with horse manure.<br>  <br>  That night the father passed by the pessimist's room and found<br>  him sitting amid his new gifts crying bitterly.<br>  <br>  "Why are you crying?" the father asked.<br>  <br>  "Because my friends will be jealous, I'll have to read all these<br>  instructions before I can do anything with this stuff, I'll<br>  constantly need batteries, and my toys will eventually get<br>  broken," answered the pessimist twin.<br>  <br>  Passing the optimist twin's room, the father found him dancing<br>  for joy in the pile of manure.

The three Jain temples, an inscription of 1295 AD and a massive pillar in the hall of the largest temple of Maharaja Kula Sri Samanta Sinha Deva, a ruler of Bahadmera (Barmer) are also worth a visit.<br>  <br>  Kiradu: Situated on the foot of a hill near village Hathma in Barmer Tehsil is Kiradu. The inscription dating back to 1161 AD reveals that the place was called Kiratkoop and had once been the capital of Punwars. The ruins of five ancient temples - once dedicated to Lord Vishnu and other four dedicated to Lord Shiva - are of interest to archaeologists and art lovers, alike. The biggest of these temples is the Someshwar Temple.<br>  <br>  Khed: Rao Siha, the founder of the Rathore clan alongwith his son (Asthanji) conquered Khed from the Guhil Rajputs and planted the standard of the Rathores. An old Vishnu temple of Ranchhrji is surrounded by a crumbling wall and an image of Garuda (the eagle) at the gate guards the complex. Other temples nearby include temples of Brahma, Bhairav, Mahadev and a Jain temple of Lard Mahaveer.<br>  <br>  Meva Nagar: Once called Viranipur, this 12th century village lies on the slope of a hill called Nagar-ki-Bhakarian, 9 km away from Balotra. The village has three Jain temples. The biggest of these is one dedicated to Nakoda Parsvanath. A Vishnu temple is also worth visiting.<br>  <br>  Balotra & Kanana: Close to Kanana, the venue for the Sheetal Saptmi Mela, lies the small town of Balotra. It is an important centre of printing and dying. <br>  TOP Y<br>  <br>  FAIRS & FESTIVALS:<br>  Tilwara Cattle Fair (March - April): A major cattle fair lasting a fortnight, held in village Tilwara.<br>  <br>  Nakoda Parasvanath (December - January): The festival held in Mevanagar village commemorating the birth anniversary of Parasvanath.<br>  <br>  Veeratara Mela: Held at Veertara (12 km from village Chohatan), the fair venerated goddess Vakaldevi and is held thrice a year in the month of Chaitra, Bhadrapada & Magha.<br>  <br>  Khed Fair (August - September): A big religious fair held on Purnima (full moon) in village Khed.<br>  <br>  Mallinath Fair, Tilwara: Mallinath Fair is one of the biggest cattle fairs of Rajasthan held annually near Tilwara, a village in Barmer District from Chaitra Budi Ekadashi to Chaitra Sudi Ekadashi (March - April). It lasts for a fortnight wherein the highly popular breeds of cows, camels, sheep, goats and horses attract people not only form Rajasthan but also Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. People of all castes and creeds participate freely in the fair.<br>  <br>  The fair is believed to have originated from transactions which took place among admires of Rawal Mallinath, a local hero, who used to travel to Tilwara on well-bred animals to meet him. A shrine dedicated to Mallinathji is located here and people make offerings of batashas and laddoos. When their wishes are fulfilled, they offer miniature horses at the shrine. Traders from Mathura, Agra and Aligarh bring horses made of wood, brass and bronze to sell at the fair. On the opening day of the fair, the flag of Rawal Mallinathji is hoisted to the accompaniment of songs extolling his greatness.<br>  <br>  Bullock, camel and horse races are organized at the fair and thoroughbred animals compete against each other on the dry river bed. The prize-winning animals sport white badges on theirs heads and command high prices at the fair. Apart from shops selling normal utility items and agricultural implements, there is a separate market for fodder at the fair. <br>  <br>  SHOPPING:<br>  A veritable shopper's paradise, Barmer is treasure trove of vibrantly coloured embroidery with excellent mirror work. Also famous are beautifully embroidered fabrics and pouches often patterned with tiny mirrors. Traditional rugs, blankets, shawls, carpets, "Pattius" Dari in typical Barmer colours and weave are speciality of the district. The shopping spots include the tiny shops along the narrow lanes of the colourful and lively Sadar Bazar.|`|34UHfffxaa	Barmer is situated at a distance of 224km from Jodhpur on the Luni-Munabao section of the Northern Railways. Located atop a hill as so many of the cities of western Rajasthan are, it houses the remains of an old fort called Garh right on its peak. The name Barmer is derived from the ruler Bahada Rao or Bar Rao who is said to have founded the town in the 13th century. Initially called ‘Bahada-mer’ it was later shortened to Barmer. To the immediate west of the city lie the remains of Juna or Juna Barmer and to the south are the ruins of three Jain temples. There is an inscription dated 1295AD on one of the pillars of the hall of the largest temple at Juna. This mentions a Maharajakula Sri Samanta Sinha Deva ruling Barmer at the time. Being a barren wasteland, the people of Barmer have learnt the hard way that they needed to develop exceptional skills in order to survive. Thriving in this nothingness lies the town of Barmer in Rajastan state, famous for its only asset – the dexterous and creative human skill, to create art, where none was.

Jm3vMKx3aa	The Visa Waiver Program is still in place. What has changed effective January 2009 is the fact that you have to provide the same data which you had to fill in the green form last year online on the website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security prior to travel. The Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA) should be applied for at least three days prior to travel. You may also apply for it in advance by leaving flight data and address blank, which you may add using the update function before travel. The travel authorization remains valid for two years or until your passport expires, whichever occurs first. You will receive a message that your travel under the Visa Waiver Program has been approved. It is planned to omit the form I-94W (green form) after a transition period, the visa waiver program will continue.<br>  The "Authorization Approved" message clearly states that it does not guarantee admission to the United States; a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer at the port of entry will have the final determination whether and how long you may stay in the United States.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_vis...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/esta_advisory.ctt/esta_advisory.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/trav...</a>|`|U9bQgfY9aa	It depends.

Many of them are single and looking to hook up. Sure, some do want money, they are called prostitutues. Generally they are alone and you will know within 5 mins if they want money or not.

As far as casinos....Palms is the best. They have 4 great clubs, Moon, Playboy Club, Rain, and Ghost Bar. You can purchase an all access pass to all 4 clubs for 40 to 60 bucks, I think.

Find a group of 6+ girls dressed in club clothes, use your Irish accent to intrigue them, and then gently ask if you can 'walk in" with them to the club.

I live in Hampshire, England. 1 hour from Cornwall, and you cannot get a decent cornish pasty here either.<br>  Ingredients for short crust pastry<br>  <br>  1lb plain flour<br>  1/2 lb either lard hard margarine or butter or a combination of these<br>  pinch of salt<br>  cold water to mix<br>  (see measure conversions for more information)<br>  <br>  <br>  Method<br>  <br>  Rub the fat into the flour but not too finely. I sometimes cut the fat into small lumps. Add the salt and then start adding the water gradually until it works together into a ball without being sticky. Put aside in a cool place.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients for filling<br>  <br>  3/4 lb beef, not stewing beef<br>  raw potato<br>  raw swede (also known as rutabaga or yellow/swedish turnip )<br>  small onion<br>  salt and pepper<br>  a walnut sized piece of butter<br>  <br>  <br>  Method<br>  <br>  Cut the steak into small pieces but do not mince. Slice potato and swede into thin, small pieces about half an inch across. Chop onion finely. Dust the work surface with flour. Roll out the pastry to about 1/4 inch thickness. Using a small plate cut out circles . Moisten the edge with milk or water and support half of the pastry nearest to you over the rolling pin. On the other half, put a small layer of prepared vegetables then a layer of beef . Repeat this once but be careful not to have too much filling which would cause the pastry to burst during the cooking process . Sprinkle sparingly with salt and pepper then add a small bit of the butter. Sprinkle a dusting of flour over the filling . Fold the other half of pastry which has been resting on the rolling pin over the filling and squeeze the half circle edges firmly together . Starting at the right side whilst supporting the left side with other hand, using first finger and thumb turn the edge over to form a crimp. Repeat this process all along the edge . This will come with practice but you must get a good seal. Brush pasty with beaten egg wash to help with browning process and put a small one inch cut in the centre of the top to allow steam to escape Bake in a hot oven 220 degrees centigrade for about 20 minutes then reduce temperature to 160 degrees centigrade for a further 40 minutes. Smaller pasties need less time. If they are browning too quickly cover loosely with greased paper.|`|9pHgUfPcaa	hi there! in brisbane there is an event every 1 and 4th sunday of each month that is called the brisbane powerhouse farmers markets (or somethign like that) held outside brisbanes powerhouse at new farm<br>  <br>  i do recall there is someone there who sells them<br>  <br>  the farmers markets r online so check them out<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  katie :)|`|4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	Why??? Will you be looking for an English pub too, with football hooligans brawling outside and vomiting their 19 pints in the gutter?<br>  <br>  Come on, when you're overseas you try the local food. You've got the rest of your life to eat pasties.<br>  <br>  So that would be ... fish & chips and/or "meat" pies, all smothered in tomato sauce then. Oh, and lager, but not in pints.|`|PpIeAcqxaa	search online|`|SqGw0XHYaa	Any good pie shop should sell Cornish Pasties<br>  If not come down to Adelaide their are a few large pie makers in Adelaide that make them like Balfours and Villis.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Just make them yourself, it isn't hard.
Jm3vMKx3aa	It depends for how long your Swiss L permit has been issued. If your permit has been issued for 4 months or longer it is considered to be a residence permit in accordance with the Schengen rules and therefore authorizes the travel to other Schengen countries like France in connection with your valid passport. If you should just hold a short term L-permit issued for less than 4 months it would be considered a national visa which does not authorize the travel out of Switzerland.<br>  <br>  The mode of travel you chose is irrelevant. The Schengen procedures are valid for both, land and air travel. The only exception exists that you still need to show your travel documents when arriving by plane in Switzerland since the constructional requirements to segregate between International and Schengen internal flights have not been accomplished yet. This is supposed to come into effect on March 29, 2009.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.swissemigration.ch/aktuell/swissemigration/00200/index.html?lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.swissemigration.ch/aktuell/sw...</a>|`|TxpIX7QFaa	No I don't think you do, as Swiss are in schengen space from 12.12.08. However I knew that it will be effective on air routes from March, although its been effective on surface transport from last Decemeber. So if I were you, I would taken a train to Paris. Its cheap, convenient and hassle free.  You will get direct TGV Lyria trains to Paris from Basel, Zurich, Geneva, Bern, Lausanne and Neuchatel, and can buy the ticket from station ticket counter.

She got help from <a href="http://www.indiaheals.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.indiaheals.com.</a> They helped arrange her treatment and hospitalisation. They have a good network of partner hospitals. You can perhaps contact them.
9a7b9b80f412db25e4cb8d6d8786a735aa	Hi, Just google snakes in Tunisia i know they have cobras, and horned vipers, i have never seen a snake in Tunisia or Djerba but i have seen the marks they make in the sand, I have seen a snake in Cyprus i was sunbathing at the side of it, it was a huge black snake, the locals said it was lucky to see one.............. (i didn't think it at the time)|`|AA11048627	they have snakes but they are not really seen much mainly in the wild|`|k4T1Jgblaa	Hi, just want I want to know!<br>  That wikipedia site does not list reptiles or insects.  Apparently they're not considered wildlife!<br>  As usual.|`|1f9aDH2Baa	Hi<br>  this should tell you what you want;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_Tunisia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of...</a>
EHw8zCgJaa	Take the UP-Katipunan jeepney and disembark when you see the a building that looks like a big house with the words "UP FILM INSTITUTE" prominently displayed. <br>  <br>  *It's the one behind the Ishmael Bernal Gallery and UP Theater. Katipunan route will take you exactly there. Just ask for assistance when you think you've missed your stop.
AA10662056	June is rainy season in Japan. So it's bad time.<br>  <br>  I recommend you to visit Japan in September.|`|d2QVB6Qyaa	We were there in May and it was a nice time to go. We did catch Golden week, ( early May) but strangely it was not that busy on the trains. So maybe you could go late May.It was pleasant temperature wise as Japan can get very hot.|`|m85AUQyAaa	tell me what is your nationality first<br>  <br>  pritam<br>  travel agent<br>  pritam.2003@gmail.com
pMrdTbCXaa	To See:<br>  <br>  1.  Miyajima:  This is a small island located just outside Hiroshima.  It was and is my favourite place to visit so far.  I highly recommend it if you are down there.<br>  <br>  2.  Nara:  There are so many beautiful temples.  If you are in Kansai, Nara is better than Kyoto.  While it isn't as big or impressive, it's very humble and just as, if not more, historical than Kyoto.  There are less people and you can walk to almost everything.<br>  <br>  3.  Sapporo:  This reminds me of home.  It has a cool summer, and a very cold winter.  It has a laid back lifestyle and seafood is reasonable.<br>  <br>  To Do:<br>  <br>  1.  Go to Izakayas.  A Japanese style tapas bar.  They are open late, real late at big chains, and they have good food.  Prices vary and it's usually filled with smoke, but it's still a lot of fun when I'm with friends.<br>  <br>  2.  Getting lost in Tokyo.  My first year in Tokyo was spent wandering the streets during the day.  I'd pick a central hub and just walk up and down the streets getting completely lost and somehow finding my way back to the station.  You can run into some interesting shops and people along the way.<br>  <br>  3.  Watching sports.  I actually liked to watch baseball for the first time in my life.  Lots of people enjoy going to games, but hate watching it on TV.  Soccer is also fun, but I haven't been to an Urawa Reds game yet.  I hear it's the best.<br>  <br>  To See (in Tokyo):<br>  <br>  1.  Shinjuku Gyoen.  This park in the middle of Tokyo may cost 200 Yen or so, but it's worth it in the middle of summer.  It's generally very quiet and it provides a great escape from the city.<br>  <br>  2.  Zojoji.  This is one of the best temples to visit in Tokyo.  It's the 3rd most famous for tourists, but rarely visited.  Because it's less crowded, you can enjoy yourself a lot more.<br>  <br>  3.  Akihabara or Harajuku.  If you love electronics, cosplay, or manga, Akihabara is the place to be.  If you are into goth lolitas, hip hop, or crazy fashion, Harajuku is the better place.<br>  <br>  Of course you can't forget shopping in Tokyo either, but that's making too many lists.<br>  <br>  Regarding one thing to take, deodorant.  You just can't get any that doesn't smell girly.
bVG7mbe0aa	Hi the photo in your link seems to be St. Pancras Chambers, as veiwed from a corner on Euston Road. It is train station located in Camden, London Borough NW1. Other sites near by, would be the British Library, which holds over 150 million items in all languages and format. Speaking of books, Harry Potter's Platform 9 3/4" was shoot in King's Cross railway station in London, which happens to be a hop, skip, and jump away from the St. Pancras Chambers.<br>  <br>  Hope you find this helpful|`|3a5811e8138d01ca325323d8ab97b2dbaa	That's St. Pancras railway station - or more specifically the Midland Grand Hotel on the face of the station that is currently being renovated.
R9I5ecwxaa	I would try to explain in two situations<br>  <br>  1) In case the exit reentry visa has expired recently then you need to explain the situation to your sponsor and get a paper approved by Jawazat in Saudi Arabia. Once you have this paper your wife needs to visit nearest Saudi Mission i.e. Saudi Consulate in Mumbai or Saudi Embassy in Delhi and get an entry visa (issued for a weeks time). Once you have this on her passport it is possible for her to enter Saudi Arabia.<br>  <br>  2) In case her exit rentry visa had expired long time ago and her resident visa was cancelled due to Iquama renewal in her absence, then you need to apply for new family visa and pay SAR 2000.00 and visit Istakdam to get a new visa (same procedure you did for the first time).
