tsAD7PyNaa	My husband is the only one on our mortgage, yet I am on the title as well.  From what I understand, if your husband passes away, unless you notify the mortgage company, they wont know.  If you have life insurance, you can use that to pay the house off.  If there is no insurance, then you can try to get a mortgage in your name.  Otherwise, you can sell, and as long as you are paying the mortgage, they cannot do anything at all while the home is up for sale.  That is, if you choose to let them know he has passed.  I am very sorry to hear of your situation.  Your home will be fine, dont worry.  Focus on your husband.|`|82e3eb215485ac8bca5c7c3854ee30ecaa	You need a will, NOW.

But, being a tax preparer for a long time, I can tell you that people like the big check. People are not good at saving money.

My wife and I are ecstatic because for the last 8 years we've paid $4-5k a year.      While I don't like the idea of a big refund normally, I look at this year as an exception.  We increased our withholdings again in the hopes of closing the gap of years past but we didn't factor in the additional dependent (new baby) and our income decreased slightly putting us in a lower tax bracket.  Also, we realized some significant capital losses.    Hopefully next year we'll bring it close to zero but we're thrilled.  Plus, if I had that money all throughout this year I would have invested it or spent it.  Now in this economy I will just save it.
HnEcgVGiaa	Sir, I strongly recommend that you do not invest in the stocks at this moment. The stock has been fluctuating in the upper 7000 to lower 8000 range for a few months now, with no relief in sight. Once the Dow breaches the 9000 point, it may be safe to start investing.    However, your best bet is to put your money in a savings portfolio - such as in HR Block - where you get 6 times the return than most savings accounts from other banks.    You may also want to consider investing in U.S. Bonds as well. Putting your money in foreign banks is not a good idea, as we saw UK and Japan go into a recession and Iceland go into a national bankruptcy.|`|5WzklgiBaa	if you want to feel safe , feel happy  you can google for HSFX Asset Management and start making consistent profits if you are serious to invest.|`|asX2hxFXaa	Keep roughly 40%-50% in stocks, 10% in money market (cash) and the rest in bonds.

You may want to consider converting all your USD into AUD (Australian Dollar) and leave it in the Time Deposit to earn a higher interest rate. Although, the interest rate of AUD may go down further, it is still a steal to buy AUD at this current price.    Leave it there and you will gain both in capital appreciation through FX gain and a decent interest rate from AUD.    However, if you risk appetite is very high, you may want to consider investing in Stocks. But, I would not do it at this moment, it could be a bear trap.    Cash is king now!

I would have recommended a pass on PFE, they have paid too much for their acquisition which does not provide the drug pipeline they need.  This is sort of deja vu, they sold off their consumer products group a few years back, I guess management does not know what they are doing or where they've been. Not a good sign.  If you need something in this area consider TEVA, ENSG, and/or AFAM, all good health care plays, best of luck.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	TEVA, ENSG and AFAM arent even listed in the S&P500.  AFAM doesnt pay dividends and is on a downtrend.  Robert seems to know a bit about PFE, but I wouldnt recommend his alternatives.      PFIZER (PFE)  Listed on the DJIA index.  PFE is the worlds largest pharmaceuticals company.    http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE...   Dividends:  32c Yield: 8.29%.      Since you own the stock, you can learn more about PFE direct from the company on their web site: http://www.pfizer.com/investors/    Charts  PFE made a double bottom price pattern with a low of about $14.30  10/10/2008  $14.31  20/11/2008 - $14.26    Although Weyth has been acquired by PFE, its still listed on Google Finance: http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE...      Alternative Health/Pharmaceuticals Investment:    JNJ  Johnson and Johnson  (Listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Avg. index).      Although not as attractive as PFE, JNJ has a 3.14% yield.  Like Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson consistently increased its dividends each year.    Over the past 10 years (1999-2009), Johnson and Johnson have increased both its net income and dividends on a year-to-year basis.    Reference:  Annual Reports 2002-8: http://www.investor.jnj.com/annual-repor...  2003 Annual Report (PDF)  Page 2    2008 might have had an effect on JNJs share price, but the recession has had no effect on the consistently strong financial performance of the underlying business.    http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE...

Gun3UGzaaa	First figure out if you technically in bankruptcy.  As a rule of thumb, if you owe more to credit cards then you make in a year, then you are insolvent and will never be able to pay it back.  Time to talk with a bankruptcy lawyer to see if that is an option to get rid of it.  It will tank your credit score, and you won't be able to get another loan for at least seven years.  It will also make moving to another apartment a big hassle if you are a renter, so make sure you are in a place where you want to stay before you file for bankruptcy.    Second, figure out what got you into this mess.  If it was an extraordinary situation - such as using credit cards because you were out of work for a year battling a major illness - then it is a matter of getting out of this one time situation.  If you are in this because you don't make enough money for your lifestyle and charged every thing, that is far more complicated.  You need to rework your budget, get a better paying (or second) job and learn to live on what you make.  Get a roommate, and practice deeply frugal living.    If you don't want to file bankruptcy, then at least call the credit card companies up, tell them you are considering bankruptcy and ask them to freeze your account and stop accruing interest.  In exchange you will pay them a significant sum per month until it is paid in full.  It will have to be a big amount - maybe $1,000 a month - for them to take you seriously.    Sorry you are in this mess.|`|bYK9AX8Raa	Hi.  I am being privately coached by a multi-millionare. Do you want to join?  Maybe this is an answer to your situation.  Check this website.

1KGXts5Daa	A career in the professional fire service is one that you will never regret choosing.  It takes an incredible amount of effort to achieve, but at your age, there is plenty of time.  Find out if your high school district offers ROP (Regional Occupation Program) Firefighting.  If so, enroll next school year as a junior and then again in your senior year.  You will love it, and get an education beyond what you could expect.      As for other high school classes that would help: anything science related, especially chemistry, biology, and environmental science.  Also any type of aerobic conditioning and strength training, nutrition, or health classes that are offered.    After high school, you will want to enroll in the "Fire Science" degree program (Associates Degree) at community college, as well as complete a state-certified EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) course, also through a local community college.    As for the school work - you're right, it will be hard.  But nothing you can't do.    As for the money - you're wrong.  It is good.  You won't regret it.|`|fAcVndo7aa	There really aren't any high school classes you should take to become a firefighter.  At a basic level, firefighting is simple, and when you get into higher level positions, it's too specialized for me to recommend a concentration in high school.  Some colleges offer degrees in Fire Science and related fields.  The money is definitely not why any of us get involved.  The range is pretty wide, but for the work you do, it's never enough, believe me.  You'll be working long hours, in all kinds of conditions, and rarely get a thank-you.  But if it's what you want to do, you'll be happy anyway.  Most of the firefighters I know wouldn't trade it for the world (I know I wouldn't change a thing).  I suggest you get in touch with your local department.  Many places have cadet programs, and volunteer departments will take probationary or junior members, as young as 16.  If it's something you think you might like, that's a pretty good way to get a look at what the job entails.    Good luck!  Let me know how things go!|`|vHB9zUcCaa	the BEST ppl 2 ask R the firemen @ yer local station. all u hafta do is wait til u C them @ some PR OR U can walk over & talk 2 the dispatcher. tell him/her that yer in HS & want 2 persue a fireman's career after graduation.

MmTe8W8uaa	If the divorce is not final, then it is illegal to file as single.    Additionally, because you lived apart for only 4 of the 12 months of the year, you do not qualify to file as head of household.    Your ONLY two options are "married filing jointly" and "married filing separately".    If you both agree to file jointly, then all credits, including those for the child, can be claimed on that joint filing (unless the child's other parent is entitled to the credits for the child).    If either of you decides to file separately, then the other must do so as well.  The child is generally claimed on the return of whichever person (1) is a parent of the child, and (2) lived with the child for at least 1/2 the year (in other words, the custodial parent).|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	You can file as married filing jointly (MFJ) or married filing separately (MFS).

Its a lot different paying $50 for $200 worth of stock than it is to pay $50 for $100,000. In he first case you'd have to make a crazy rate of return on the trade (25%) just to break even. If you'ree paying him $7500 a year to manage a hundred grand  you'd have to make over 10% on your portfolio just to equal what you'd make on a 1 year CD at no risk.Get a breakdown of what he's charging then shop it around and make sure you are comparing apples to apples. Some trades are inherently more complicated than others so the cost may be different.  Remember that a broker's job is to get as much from you as they can.  Some do that by always looking out for the best interests of their clients, but too many could care less about your bottom line as long as they increase theirs.  Bottom line is you have to be responsible for your own research sometimes. You have to go into it knowing you might get screwed and always look for warning signs.    .

If you have an emergency fund, build your retirement account & pay off your house. "Why buy mutual funds when the market is in the basement?" you ask. Well wouldn't you buy a pair of pants at basement bargain prices? Well why not do the same with your mutual funds.    Dave would tell you to keep doing the baby steps. If you hear about layoffs in your company and you may be one of them, he would tell you to stop baby step 2 (if that is your step) and stock pile money for the emergency.    Baby Step 1: $1000 baby emergency fund  Baby Step 2: Pay off all debt using the Debt Snowball   Baby Step 3: 3 to 6 months of expenses in savings   Baby Step 4: Invest 15% of household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement   Baby Step 5: College funding for children   Baby Step 6: Pay off home early   Baby Step 7: Build wealth and give!

P8CBDLiKaa	I think you may be confusing the $600 stimulus payment mailed out by the Bush administration with the current Stimulus Package that the Obama administration is pushing through congress.  That is a package of spending plans and tax cuts designed to stimulate the over-all economy and turn this recession around as soon as possible. It has nothing to do with your 2008 federal or state tax refunds.    Let's keep our fingers crossed that it works.

CZjpqLvRaa	If you want maximum $$ list with Sedo or submit to a Moniker auction. Could take a while to sell but best bet for top dollar for real premium names.    If you are in a hurry to sell try EBay or a domain name forum where resellers hangout like DNForum, NamePros, NameMatters. You are unlikely to get the best price at these venues but they should result in a quick sale if price is flexible.    Check out Afternic and TDNam.    There are hundreds of domain name sales pages on the web that will accept your listing, many for free.    You could attempt to sell directly to an end user by contacting businesses/individuals that might want to use the name. Time consuming, but end user sales are nearly always the best way to get top dollar.    Best way to sell depends on the name, how quickly you wish to sell and whether you want top dollar or will settle for something less.|`|MdALr1Nhaa	I would suggest that if you list them on eBay and they haven't sold, you didn't offer a "great price" - you offered them at a higher price than the market was willing to bear. The market determines price, not the seller.    Lots of registrars like Godaddy have sale services but they generally all want to take their cut.    If you are serious about being a dealer, you might want to think about setting up your own website.

As far as your problem,   Tell your mom you want to put your money in the bank. She will go with you to the bank and you can open an account. I dont know were you live but the TCF bank by my house is giving $50 dollar gift card to who ever opens an account. Maybe you can open an account there, and you will have $50 dollars to do gorcery.

But removing collection accounts can help a little but, and that is where thoses credit help places come in.

1da3bf2575e7b0729442de82450266caaa	Suppose you are a mortgage company. You have $1 million in capital, loaned out to 10 customers at 8% interest rate over 30 years. Obviously you are going to get your money back, either in payments or in foreclosed houses but its going to take a while. So in order to have the million back today you  sell them to some other investors. Obviously you have to give up some of your future profits for cash now.    You could sell those 10 loans to 10 investors. Each investor would be taking a risk in buying those loans, because if any loan defaults, that one investor loses his money. Naturally, investors would not be willing to pay very much for those loans, knowing the risk involved. In order to get a better price, you combine the 10 loans into one  special purpose entity, which you then split into 10 equal shares. Each investor still pays the same $100,000+x, but instead of owning one loan, they will own 10% of all 10 loans. If one loan fails, every investor loses only 10%.    And you can do even better, by buying credit derivatives insuring against the default or inflation and adding them to the entity.    The result is that you will be able to sell the loan assets for more money, and investors are insulated from the volatility of directly owning mortgages.
oB8TysC5aa	I own shares and am still trying to work that one out. It just don`t make sense that gamblers can change value of company. Shares are a commodity just like tins of beans    Too Vicky S only if the company puts more shares on the open market|`|bxlYleZkaa	it is all relative. A higher share value means more people will invest in the company which will then have more assets and liquidity and a greater chance of being able to borrow at a better rate.|`|XzScEyQZaa	It doesn't. It is only worth what it's shares are worth plus any retained assets.|`|Jil94qTAaa	A share is like a debt, only that is not with a bank but with a particular person, and then you dont need pay interest, only a dividend. Is a way in that a firm grows because they earn money for expand its business save money, etc. If the prices of the shares is high, then the company can emit them at higher price and earn more money throughout this process. Also the company rises its price, in this way they are considered more solid and with morecredibility, less propenses to the bankruptcy, then the banks consider that is less risky borrow money to the firm, for this reason they have the confidence to borrow more money or borrow money with less interest rate, because they have confidence on the payment.    The price of the share is High, only because the investors are willing to pay it, that means that the investors have confidence on the firm, because the share pays or because is a safe investment.
Pjm9pg7iaa	You buy the house with so little money that the owner does not give you a deed. You get a "contract" which acts as your deed. If you make all the monthly payments and finally pay off the whole mortgage, you get the deed.  It can work. The problem comes when the seller gets another loan on the house while you "own" it.  Then you have to mess with that.  Or when the seller dies before the loan is paid off. Then there is no one to sign your deed when you make the last payment. You have to go to his estate and see if you can get someone to sign the deed. Or if the property goes up $100,000 in value (like it did in 2004 during the boom) and the seller regrets his "contract for deed" and tries to find any way in the world to get you to make a mistake so he can kick you out and keep the property..|`|TpMvr1pyaa	lease purchase; an exc way to buy. i suggest you consider getting  an exclusive buyer's agent to help you|`|RfbpvqSWaa	A contract for deed gives you ownership rights to the property.

AA11598210	~~If they take you to court and receive a judgment then yes they can perfect the judgment and attach your checking accounts, wages, etc. Whatever means to collect the debt is at their disposal.~~|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	They must sue you for the amount due first, and then when the court grants them the judgment, they must ask the court to have the money garnished from your wages and/or your tax refunds and/or any tax stimulus payments for which you might otherwise qualify.    There is no "standard" limit on how much they can take.  The garnishment level is based on an employee's disposable earnings.      When the disposable income amounts is determined, the maximum amount that can be garnished in any pay period may not exceed the lesser of two figures:    25 percent of the employee's disposable earnings or    the amount by which an employee's disposable earnings for the workweek are greater than 30 times the federal minimum wage.     So probably the best you can hope for is 25% of your "disposable" income can be garnished through your paycheck.|`|AA12220949	In time, yes.    However, if they do, they must give you ample notifcation and warnings.  If you dismiss these warnings, they will make a case out of it and get their money.  Not only is your checking account in danger, your tax refund is in danger.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I do not think that a debt collection agency can do this but I am not an expert on this subject.

In your area, I am sure you can find a Debt Federally funded agency to offer you some good free advice. Keep your bank account a secret from the Debt people. Good Luck!|`|rRggovPfaa	Absolutely.  Side topic:A landlord can do this as well if there's a judgment against you.|`|pUuwzZUzaa	The collection agency themselves cannot take money from  your account.

They could technically take you to court, but that is not likely either.  If they did take you to court, they would have to win the case and receive a judgment against you.  Then they would have to pursue the judgment and at that point, if they could prove you could afford to pay them, a judge could order you to pay.  Why not just call a company like http://www.debtreliefplace.com ?

qBCGH52haa	While all financial opinions on this forum should be taken cautiously, experts suggest that if you have sufficient time until retirement, you should ride it out.  Selling out your investments locks in your losses.  Continued investment is what is called dollar cost averaging, meaning that you are actually buying cheap stocks that will make more money for you when the market bounces back.    However, if you are not sleeping at night, you are what is considered risk averse and probably should be considering safer, less volatile investments.  Less risky investments carry less chance of losing money, but also less chance of reaping large gains if the market rebounds.|`|zCFhBBCaaa	You don't state your age, but I can tell you when mine dropped 50% in 1980 I bailed out and it's a good thing.

If he knowingly deposits bogus bucks, and then withdraws "real" money.. it is a Federal felony.  Think bank robbery...20yrs plus in a fed pen,|`|7eClZPuiaa	if they look that close to the real bills just tell your friend to say he though they were real, you can get in trouble for knowingly passing fake bills but if he just says he though they were real, had no idea of counterfeit bills, He cant really get into any trouble. Now if they can prove he knew the bills were fake(like goin and taking that exact amount out after he just deposits it) he could get into big trouble. If they dont look/feel 100% real dont try it because hell get busted, better off just buying merchandise and then returning it for real cash|`|rryZV8lWaa	It's a federal offense to even posess counterfeit money, let alone to deposit it at a bank.  Expect a call from the Secret Service fairly soon.|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	If it is cash and it goes unnoticed generally the bank is stuck. If they notice then all of it will be confiscated and reported to the Secret Service. From there the Feds will decide his fate. Generally one or two bills nothing happens, but a whole wade of it you can expect a lot of jail time.     Now a check if the bank suspects him of knowingly putting in bad money then as others have said he could receive fines, jail time, etc. just depends on what the bank wants to do.     Basically depositing a large check then going to another branch and taking it out right away is a pretty could sign of fraud. Account will be froze and most likely the Secret Service will take over from there.     Now he deposits and takes out little by little his account will go negative when the check is returned and if he doesn't pay the debt back he will be put on chexsystems and his credit will be destroyed.     Best thing to do is smack your friend and be like wtf are you an idiot?|`|YmHwCKX0aa	Most tellers are trained in detecting counterfeit cash.  If the texture of the fake bill is a little off, the teller will usually catch it.  (They go through thousands of dollars each day).  Every teller usually has a counterfeit pen and/or black light to confirm their suspicions.    Even if the teller does not catch the bill, when the teller closes up for the day, all remaining money is run through a money counter which is also designed to detect counterfeits.  When a conterfeit bill enters the system, the Secret Service is notified.  At that point an intensive investigation is started which includes pulling surveylance tapes and a copy of all transactions done by the teller.  Then, it's only a matter of time until your friend is caught.... they always get caught.|`|1Gxylklwaa	It is illegal and a fraud charge might be put on your friend. You better advice him not to do so...It is not right perild.
Zp4PAdmUaa	There are some good online calculators that you can use to get a general idea of what you might be looking at for a refund or balance due.    One of the main things you need to keep in mind is the number of exemptions you claim on your W-4.  The lower the number of exemptions you claim, the more your employer takes out of your paycheck for Federal Income Taxes, "zero" being the lowest.  Obviously, this means you get a smaller paycheck, but this also means you will more withholding to claim on your 1040 which could mean either owing less or getting a larger refund.    If you're employer gave you a 1099 at the end of the year, and there is no withholding reported, then it is very likely you will owe (unless you have enough valid deduction to claim to offset your tax liability)|`|AA10469473	If you claimed one on your W-4, and you're single, they should have taken enough out so you wouldn't owe more when you file.

The signing of the 1040 is not an implied signing of the statement.  Check if the program you are using allows you to write notes or attachments -- many do.  If not, you could e-file your return without the statement and separately mail in the statement with form 8453 to the IRS on which your e-file number is registered.

Speak with HR Block about amending your return if you think it is incorrect|`|rY8NF65taa	If you want to refile your taxes you can file a Form 1040X, the amended tax form.  The form is completely different from a normal tax return, and you need to be sure to have your original return because it will ask for the originally filed numbers as well as your new totals.  I don't know who prepared your return already, but I recently read an article about how unenrolled preparers correctly prepare returns 35% of the time in a an IRS test.  Unenrolled preparers are those that are not CPA's and have not passed the exam given by the IRS in order to qualify to represent taxpayers during audits and appeals.  If you used a CPA, then I would be more inclined to trust the results.  If not, it might be worth checking it out, but I wouldn't just go to some guy down the road that thinks he knows what he's talking about when he really doesn't.

rzS7fc99aa	After a period of time, credit debts can become 'statute barred'. This means that it can no longer be enforced through the county court system, so the creditor wouldn't be able to force any money out of you. The debt still exists though, and can show up on credit reference files.    It will be statute barred if six years went by (in England/Wales or five in Scotland) and a) you didn't make any payments b) you didn't acknowledge in writing that you owe the debt and c) the creditor has not got a County Court Judgment against you. If you make payments or acknowledge it in writing while the 'clock' is still running it will restart, so the creditor gets another 6 years. But if it ever goes past the limitation period they are out of time forever.    If you notify a creditor that a debt is statute barred it THEIR responsibility to show that it isn't. They would need to do this to get access to a County Court Judgment. They should also stop chasing you for the debt at this point, under official guidelines on debt collection practices.    There are a few minor complications to do with joint debts and overdrafts. For mortgage shortfalls the limitation period is 12 years.    If you think your debt fits the rules for a statute barred debt, take a look at the website www.nationaldebtline.co.uk (a debt advice charity) for a fact sheet that sets out the rules in more detail and a sample letter you can use to write to a creditor informing them that the debt is statute barred.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Do you mean debt? If so, yes you may be pursued for it indefinitely.|`|ZCo6OFToaa	It will be time barred, they can ask you for it, but that's about it.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Yes, a civil debt is not enforceable after that period though some may well try a mail campaign to try to scare you into paying.

1wV2sANcaa	What state are you in? Do you know the laws that apply there? For example in the state of Alabama the rule of buyer beware applies except in the cases of heath and safety if an inspection could not easily turn up the problem. I put a contract on a house in that state and 2 days before closing there was a heavy rain and the basement flooded. Nothing had shown up on the home inspection the week before but it turns out the basement had flooded 2 other times and the owner fixed it. I ended the contract, but if this had happened after closing  I could have sued them and won. They knew about a serious health and safety violation that could not be easily found through a home inspection and did not disclose it. Check your state laws about disclosure. Try googling it.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Yes. They need to disclose everything about the house so that you can make an informed decision. You should talk with an attorney.    P.S. I stand corrected.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Probably not. If it was ceiling damage, you should hae noticed that when you were viewing and when you had the final inspection.|`|AA11132354	Probably NOT.  You had right of inspection and had ability to discover for yourself.  Ceiling damage is not on list of required disclosures, like lead paint and basement flooding.  Why did it take 2 months to discover?  Had former owner done anything to hide the damage?|`|6YVckVa2aa	probably depends on your state laws. Here in IL, you have exactly one year from the date of closing.  I would find out what your statute of limitations is in your state.   By the way, this applies even if you did not get a home inspection. It is illegal for people to lie on their home disclosure and omitting home problems on a home disclosure is the same as lying.|`|x9TgRvkbaa	Although morally, the previous homeowners could and should have disclosed problems in the home. But, it is a buyer beware market, so, you should have gotten an inspection and they should have saw that problem, if you chose you didn't want to fix it, you could have backed out the deal.|`|OujhXy2yaa	No you can't, that's why you get an inspection before you buy a house, the American philosophy on purchases is and always has been "buyer beware"  It is the buyers responsibility to have a licensed inspector inspect a new home.  There are very few exceptions to this rule and ceiling damage is not one of them.

zuGKIWfNaa	That doesn't mean you'd be paid any more than the minimum wage.

O8qdCBzLaa	I was 26, married, and had a baby. I also had just gotten out of the navy and landed a job at a cable company that was very secure. So, I went ahead and bought a place.    The advantage of renting is that you have the flexibility to move around to pursue an education or career. There are also a lot of responsibilities that come with home ownership (lots more bills and maintenance issues). So, I wouldn't recommend that you buy something right away. Prices aren't going anywhere for another year or two, at least. So, you're not going to miss out on the real estate opportunity by waiting a while.    Rent a place and save your money.You'll need it for the down payment, as well as for things like furniture, appliances, paint, carpet, etc. Then, if it seems like you've found the place where you're going to settle down for awhile (steady job, you like the town you're in, etc.), then look into buying a place.

It depends on where you live? Some cities, its cheaper to rent.  What can you afford and what can you live without! If you rent and the roof leaks or the furnace breaks, you call the landlord. If you own, YOU have to hire someone and pay for it. There are a thousand reasons to own and just as many to be a renter.  Evaluate your lifestyle, job, income, willing to commit (its like a marriage to own a house)   Think it out. Make a list of pros and cons  And good luck either way!|`|fMPuTA6Uaa	Renting truly is throwing away money.

zTj6bnIlaa	The source of all taxation is the Bank of England although it may not seem that way. When William of Orange signed the Tonnage act he gave this privately owned bank the right to create money from fresh air, charge interest for it and receive taxation.Mps are not allowed to criticise the B of E on the commons floor and no one is allowed to know who owns it. This why the bank bailout was always gonna happen as the government cannot ignore the banks orders to inject capital into its systems.  Its admittedly hard to initially see this in the UK but easier to see in the Bank of Englands subsiduary company the Federal Reserve, because in the states 99% of all income tax goes directly to fed.

Tax rules are all over the map concerning 1099 distributions, ranging from none to quite a lot (Illinois, for example, does not charge income tax on retirement distributions, while Wisconsin, right next door, will charge their own penalty tax for early distribution). Your state distribution, if it is taxable in your state, is most likely the taxable part of your federal distribution.|`|JuGq4xNUaa	The reason it's blank is because the issuer of the 1099 does not know whether it is taxable to your state.  Most computer programs will default to make the payment taxable.  So, unless, you are positive that it is not, you should be paying tax on it.
RDgyb7W8aa	All my friends whom I worked with in collections are saying that it is getting very hard.  They work at a credit union getting paid a salary and getting all the overtime they want.  In DC area overtime for collectors is between $35.00 and $42.00 per hour.  Of course they have production standards and most say they are tired.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Well people working in that industry have a lot of calls to be making these days.

How do you know she had already turned you down before the screening report? Just because the reporting agency recommended you does not mean she has to accept you! Obviously something came up in the screening that did not meet their standards.  Screening fees are NOT refundable!  They are called fees for a reason!!    It sounds like you are just pissed off that you did not get that place and are just trying to get back at her.  GROW UP!|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	$60 is high for a screening fee, but they are almost always non-refundable.

For the interest income, you're lucky the professor doesn't compound it daily or monthly.  Since it's only once a year, then just add 7% interest income for year 1 (i.e. $350).  Then, on year two, you need to use the cumulative amount of the $5000 deposit, plus the $350 interest, plus the $5500 deposit... and then add the 7%.    Of course... this is entirely unrealistic real world stuff because you're assuming the deposits happen on the 1st of each year term (otherwise, the amounts would be progressive all year long, and so the average balance would be less than the full deposit amount).

However, they don't have to keep our best interests in mind, they pretty much can do whatever they want. If we don't pay taxes, they come after us for it.

If the worksheet shows that you got too much you get to keep it - you don't have to pay back any advance money.  On the other hand, if the worksheet shows that you are due more money you can claim that on this year's return and have it included in your refund: line 70 on the 1040, line 42 on the 1040A or line 9 on the 1040-EZ.

Some taxpayers did not receive the full amount due to having too high an income, too low tax liability, or claiming a new child they did not last year.    Any amount you received last year is used just to determine if you received the full amount.  So if you received the full amount last year it will have no affect on your 2008 tax return.

If you didn't receive it, you are able to claim it now.|`|qBCGH52haa	It only affects you tax return if the IRS misfigured the original stimulus check.  This will occur only if your income went over the phase out line..for example, if you earned say $155,000 (family), you would not have been entitled to the full check.  However, if you made say $145,000 in 2007, the IRS would have sent you the full check and you would have any difference between what they sent and what you were entitled to taken out of your rebate or added to your liability.    Otherwise, it will have no affect.

4ZNl4V3Oaa	If you are attending school away from home, you are treated as living in your parents home for tax purposes and therefore meet the residence test.  The only way out is if you can prove that you provide more than half of your OWN support.  There's a worksheet on page 20 of IRS Pub 501 http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf that you and your parents can use to see if that test is met.    If you can be claimed as a dependent you lose your personal exemption even if you parents don't claim you.  If they do and you try to, both tax returns will be held up by the IRS while they investigate the matter and resolve it according to the law.  Having copies of that completed worksheet handy would go a long way towards proving your claim if in fact you can't be claimed as a dependent.

Unless you have full knowledge in this field, you should not give this type of details.      Simply dont blame the small builders.  What you know about the reputed builders?      Yahoo Answers is now getting momentum in its popularity. Lot of people will unnecessarily be misled by your wrong advice.      During 1980s flats culture came in Chennai city due to increase in land costs. right from then the charges for Water Supply, Drainage, Electricity Deposits are separately charged by builders as it goes to civic bodies. It is like collection of sales tax by traders and service tax collection by telephones in your telephone bill.    Regarding covered car parking a space is given to you exclusively by providing roof by spending money by builders. Open parking are not charged. Moreover the area of covered parking is not included in the salable area of the flat.     In case of a person paying an advance of Rs.10 lakhs and after few months if he is canceling the builder is not cheating but waiting for the further booking to release the advance amount.  Since the person paid advance will definitely expect progress of the building, the builder invest the same in the construction and it will be difficult for him to return immediately. That is why he is waiting for the further booking to return the advance.    Why to wait for two years.  You can refer a party and get your advance back on his booking.  Mentioning waiting for even two years is a misleading statement.    Regarding the extra works you have to understand that the builder will give detailed specification of his scope of work in the agreement itself.  If you opt for any extra work like wood work for shelves, safety grill door for entrance door etc. definitely the builder will charge for that and what is in charging those extras.    Some times the flooring may be ceramic tiles and the purchaser will opt for marble and in such case do you expect the builder to do it free?      I think you know little about small builders and do not know anything at all about big builders.    The small builders doing one ground and two grounds joint ventures etc. are atleast will deliver the flat within stipulated short time.  but the big builders constructing 20 stories, 800 apartments complex are booking the flats before commencing and collect almost 30% as advance and even after a lapse of three years from the date of booking only 20% of the works in progress and ultimately in 5 years you will get your flat.  In the third year itself you would have paid 90% of the cost and incurring interest payments.   These are all facts in OMR road projects Chennai.      You enquire with the big builders regarding the cost of car parking, service connection charges etc. it is in percentage of the cost of flat and if you calculate it will be more than double charged by the small builders.    In case of cancellation atleast small builders will refund it without any deduction and if you go to big builder it is not possible to get the advance immediately and they will deduct some cancellation penalty also.    PLEASE DONT MISGUIDE & MISLEAD YAHOO ANSWERERS BY WAY OF YOUR HALF BAKED WRONG INFORMATION.|`|aWbwKiXpaa	I totally disagree.  Nowadays people are very clever and moreover some peoples are cheating small builders by way of not paying the final payment properly.  In my experience a person known to me has cheated his builder a huge payment. This type of cheating by the purchasers happens only with the small builders.    Big builders won't give the keys unless the party pays in full even before the completion of the work.    don't confuse people by way giving this type of wrong information.

I have sold properties for into the 7-figure range...never once saw a selling agent send out a photo book.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Everything these days is done by virtual so unless you are using your talents to create a great virtual layout for the realtor to show on line, a book or brochure isn't going to be much help.  Everyone shops on line and expects to see a great virtual tour of the available real estate before they decide to look at the homes.  It's up to the realtors to decide who to use and many take the pictures themselves although I think a pro would be better able to take the shots for the virtual tour.  And this is all free to the home seller through the real estate company. I don't see why realtors would pay extra for albums rather than virtual when their highest hits are on the internet and not walk ins.  Check with real estate companies before you decide to do this.  I wouldn't pay extra to sell my home when the realtor already will take pictures to put on the virtual tour online.  It doesn;t make sense.|`|PF2FBKBDaa	67 juan, no more unless he have good cameraa|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	I think you have a good idea, but you might be better off contacting and possibly contracting with real estate agents and brokers, rather than sellers.
9k4d7Kytaa	Well...you may have an alternative option.  Is your vehicle being totalled because of the type of damage it sustained, such as frame damage?  Or is it simply being totalled because the cost to repair (I think you stated this was $4,000, you were kind of all over the place and tough to follow) is too high of a percentage of the value of the vehicle which you stated at $6,000?    If it's being totalled because of the type of damage it sustained, you're pretty much out of luck.  The leinholder legally has to be paid off before you see any money, and if you wanted to keep driving it you'd have to buy the vehicle back from the insurance company (they own it when they total it) and get a salvaged title.  I wouldn't recommend doing this if you can avoid it.    If the vehicle is only being considered a total loss because the cost of repair is too high in comparison to value of the vehicle, then you can try to get the insurance company to agree on a higher value for the vehicle.  This is called the actual cash value, and it's typically based on what the vehicle would sell for on the open market.  It's fairly subjective and sometimes you can get the adjuster to agree to a higher value by documenting recent repair work, custom or aftermarket parts you have, if it was in exeptional shape for it's age, etc.  If you can get the insurance company to agree to raise the value of the vehicle by $1,000 for example, perhaps the cost of repair is not beyond their threshold and they will be able to pay for repairs and you'll continue on as if it had never happened.  I've helped clients of mine do this same thing and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't...but it's worth a shot.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	The OTHER PERSON'S insurance does NOT have to put the bank's name on the car, HOWEVER, they don't have to pay you the whole amount, until you turn the TITLE over to them.    And you can't, because the bank has it.      So, tell them you want to be paid directly.  Then you'll get, maybe $3,000.   And try to fix the car yourself with that.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	The check has to be written in both your name and the bank's name, period. There is no way around this. If you decide you want to keep the vehicle then the insurance company will deduct the salvage value from the check, however it will still be issued in both names. Once the bank finds out the car has been totaled (they will know because you will be at the bank asking them to endorse a check from an insurance company made out to both of you) they will demand that you sign over the check to them which they will apply to the loan and then call in the balance of the loan for immediate payment (failure to sign over the check means they will call in the loan for immediate payment). So you'll still be left with no money, only now you'll have a busted up car with no money to fix it and an angry bank calling you every day to pay the balance of the loan.|`|qvVfIrhDaa	Pay off the car.  Keep driving it until you can't.  I have a friend who drove a totaled "one door" for four years.|`|rrp9c2tnaa	The only way you could continue to drive the car is to go through the legal process of obtaining a salvage title.  The insurance company will report the car as totalled to the state.  You will not be able to tag/title the car until you have successfully obtained a salvage title and proven to the state DMV that the car is salvageable.      We went through this process with my stepson's car a few years ago.  If we had known from the first what would be involved, we would never have done it.  We would have paid off the bank with the insurance check and started all over with new loan/new car.
crMvxAfdaa	I've seen several of my friends over the years come from the same situation and go out to live on their own. Most of them ended up moving back home.  The other guy hit it spot on with the roomies not paying up. One of my friends ended up having to pay his apartments $1300 all himself because one roomie got fired and the other was just a bum.       Financially, I say its "doable" but not really a good start. You can NEVER count on a raise because you really never know if it will happen, or if for some reason your hours get cut/new boss/something random happens. In this economy its even harder to find a job.  Lets say you can pull it off and your roomies pay exactly what they need to. You will still end up paying for pizza's/take out your roomies bring in. You will probably go out to eat with them and to the movies. You'll find out that soap/detergent/clothes/make up/medicine/etc all add up to be a big expense each month.  I would say, best case scenario, you're going to end up spending at least $900 of your $1000 income. $100 a month (at best) is not enough to pay for education, not enough to invest, and not even enough to save up.  If you lost your job in the coming months/years, you'd be broke soon.  Better off figuring a way to increase your income before moving out.  Besides, at home you get access to your parents stuff which you probably won't have again for years and years.     Also, why would you want to move from your parents house, to a small apartment with roomies who will probably be loud when you don't want them to be, be messier than you expected, steal your food or other stuff, maybe even party like crazy?  And they run the chance of stiffing you on the bills if they lose their job or are not good with their money.      Unless your parents are CRAZY strict and are trying to rule every part of your life, then I'd just stay home.  Lets say the only thing your parents do not allow you to do is drink at their house. Then you're paying $400 a month plus all the extra costs just to have the privilege of drinking?|`|XowM9e7Naa	If the apartment rents for $400 per month, most landlords would not rent to you unless your income is at least 3 times that amount.  You should be looking for an apartment for around $330 per month.|`|AA11966821	Your income is pathetic and that $400/month is 40% of your income.  Way out of line.  Furthermore, to keep the rent that low, you obviously will have more than one roommate, therefore multiple bones of contention and multiple ways to get shafted on the rent.    Roommates have a tendency to fuel each other's budget-busting.  One wants to call out for pizza one night, and another suggests a movie the next.  Then somebody gets caught short on rent and the others are legally obligated to pay that share of the rent.    Truly a bad idea.  Save up your money and work on getting a better job and more income.  You are going to need to double your income before the end of 2009 -- I won't go into an economic dissertation on that in a short post, but you are going to have tremendous need of a lot more money before year-end.

If you are getting anything from the EIC, you'd  lose that completely as you cannot claim the EIC on separate returns.    If you file a joint return, attach Form 8379 and the IRS will apportion the refunds between you.  They'll send you your share and capture his for the child support debt.  This is usually the best way to go.
BoAEgaAGaa	In the attached information about 1040 Estimated tax payments, there is a worksheet that may help you estimated how much tax you will need to pay on a quarterly basis.  When you are self-employed you have to not only pay your federal income tax, but your Social Security and Medicare tax.      I know it will be hard to estimate your income since it will be sporadic but you will have to come up with a rough estimate.  The % of tax you will be paying when you file your tax return is 15.3% for SS and Medicare tax.  There is an adjustment of 1/2 of this amount off your income.  Then the federal income tax is depending on which tax bracket you will be in, depending on all your income.      Give this worksheet a try and see how you do.

The more you make, the bigger a percentage you'll have to pay to the government.    Your local library will have hard copy tax forms and instructions.  Pick up a copy of the instruction booklet for the basic forms, and refer to the Tax Tables near the back of the booklet.  If you can calculate how many jobs you'll have time for, or how much money you'll need to earn on an annual basis, you can cross reference how much the IRS would expect you to pay in taxes.  Convert that to a percentage, and you'll have a good estimate as to what you'll need to set aside.    Quarterly taxes are optional.  It really just makes it a bit easier to write the check, since you're dealing with smaller dollar values.  You can process everything on your annual return, if that's easier for you.    I believe there's a different form to use for your quarterlies, but it's pretty much the same as any other tax return.  You fill in the blanks, do the math, and get to a total due at the bottom of the form.  From there, you just mail a copy of the form, along with a check, to the address shown on the form.  I have to assume that you can also do this online, but I never have.  If you're doing quarterlies, you do also have to submit your paperwork annually.  The annual form will ask what you've paid in during the year, along with what you've earned.  If you've paid too much on your quarterlies, they'll give it back to you in a refund, just as if your employer had withheld too much.

Sure, I guess she could use her last pay stub and probably be darn close on the figures she plugged in, but if she were way off -- then what?  Des Moines will simply adjust the income and calculate what the figures should have been.    Can she get into trouble = possibly.  Would she = doubtful.  However, it is simply better to wait and plug in the numbers from the W-2 on the 1040 form.  No tax preparer will finalize a return without all W-2s simply because they want all the numbers to add up correctly and come out right so someone does not have to sit there and adjust figures on the return...that means there is less chance for error, less likelihood for looking at this return for other errors (possible in-house audit) and a faster refund.      I would urge her to wait.
QmBf3PPDaa	A dummy activity is a simulated activity of sorts, one that is of a zero duration and is created for the sole purpose of demonstrating a specific relationship and path of action on the arrow diagramming method. Dummy activities are a useful tool to implement when the specific logical relationship between two particular activities on the arrow diagramming method cannot specifically be linked or conceptualized through simple use of arrows going from one activity to another. In this case, the creation of a dummy activity, which serves essentially as a form of a placeholder, can provide exceedingly valuable. Dummy activities should in no cases be allocated any duration of time in the planning and/or scheduling or project activities and components. When they are illustrated in a graphical format, dummy activities should be represented by the user of a dashed line with an arrow head on one end, and may in some cases be represented by a unique color.

If you have not spent as much as they say then there is a mistake or a fraud. The statements will show all the transactions you have made or someone has made if you card has been cloned and where the card was used.

Money may not mean much to you now, but when you have a mortgage or have kids to support you might change your mind!

The law will be on her side because of your lease.  If you do not put the rent into escrow, pay her, and then you can take her to court.  Do not tape her on a recorder without letting her know, but somehow, like thru text messaging, email, or a voice messaging service where she leaves a message, get her to discuss the verbal agreement she made with your husband so that have something to stand on in court.  Also, get some affidavits from others that she has had work for her, but that she has not paid.  make sure you read your lease carefully for any fine details.   You sound like you are on a month-to-month lease now since you have been there for 8yrs, so weigh your options carefully, because not paying your rent can lead to an eviction, and you don't know whether or not she is the one doing the accounting and management of the property herself, to be aware of your circumstanstantial arrangment with her.<br>  Good Luck

DAMZKbpDaa	It is likely, when you fill out your Sch-C, that you can write expenses down below $400 so you won't have to pay self employment or income taxes.    But you do need to file with self-employment more than $400. The IRS will be looking for you to claim that income.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Yes, you have to file. You won't have to pay any taxes, if that was the only the income you had.|`|JuGq4xNUaa	Yes, you need to file Schedule C.  The 1099's that you receive will be sent to the IRS and they will be looking for a return to match it.|`|KfxTNNP5aa	I think by law the cutoff for not filing is $600 but you should anyway as you will likely get a little money back. Go figure that one out.
DAMZKbpDaa	It is not illegal. And, the IRS doesn't check bank accounts.    However, some banks won't allow a deposit to an account not belonging to the taxpayer.     You should check with your bank as to their policy.|`|AA11408683	Your brother must trust you a great deal, to put his money in your acct. I see no reason why this should be a problem.|`|yO5tm6e1aa	There is nothing illegal about it.  You can have it deposited into anybodies account you want.  There is no program that matches the name on the account with the person filing the taxes.  Rather, after the return is processed, it is deposited into the account specified by the taxpayer.  It matters not if you direct deposit the money into your domestic partner's account, your spouse account, or your brother's account.  However, if the person keeps the money, it must be below $10,000 or it's a taxable gift next year.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	no it's not illegal, but some banks won't allow it...then it would be returned to irs and a paper check issued....|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Its not illegal..He can have his return go to any bank account he wants it to go to.

eGIWO78zaa	Here is some sample questions from 2000-01   http://www.deca.cccs.edu/quizBowl/DECAEx...    or    More sample questions from past quiz bowls:   http://www.deca.org/funteaching.html
AA10994943	Nothing can be proved if it's not in writing but it might be nice to give at least 2 weeks pay to stay on good terms.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	No...she owes a 7-DAY NOTICE.    Because the law states that if you pay rent WEEKLY that you have to give 7-day notice to vacate.  This is what is known in the law as a statutory lease and is what judges use in the absence of a written one.    I hope your sister paid by check so she can prove that she paid weekly and not monthly...that will be important if she gets sued by her landlord.    PS:  The landlord can also used check images run through his/her bank to prove how often the rent was paid, so those that posted that it cannot be proved, unless only cash was exchanged, it sure as heck can.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	I would not think so since she was renting the place by the week.  If the owner pursues her, it might be cheaper to pay a months rent than pay a lawyer!
Gun3UGzaaa	Usually it takes that long to get financing approved by the mortgage lender.  And, the time can increase or decrease, as long as both parties agree.
Hx88UGlpaa	There's only two ways to stop a judgement and garnishing of wages,etc...you pay the debt, or file bankruptcy. Good Luck!|`|dfb2419bdb22a3d3c381d69db6b27c9baa	I work for a financial institution and basically speaking, once a judgment has been enforced, your pretty much out of luck unless there is indisputable evidence that the judgment had already been paid orhas been incorrectly linked to your account.
10554e42be61cc129e1f63de5ce47d79aa	the Fed is the reserve... so yes and no we will always have debt unless we find a way to pay back 9 trillion dollars|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	Obviously English is not your first language. Are you doing a school project in Poland?
cOYkCEZsaa	You did the right thing about calling last week but if you haven't heard back yet I wouldn't expect to. After an interview within a couple of days I always send a letter or email to the person who interviewed me telling them what a pleasure it was to meet them, and how much I would love to work with them.
3FEetxrEaa	You are going to be OK, except the check stubs will not cut it.    You are self employed, you need to bring in your last 2 income tax returns to show your yearly income.|`|XowM9e7Naa	I am a landlord. I wouldn't rent to a professional gambler or an attorney.  The gambler does not have a predictable income, and the attorney would probably sue me.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Explain your circumstances and offer to pay for two months up front. Or, go to a residency hotel where they charge by the week. They're more used to the turnover of tenants.
hHSsMyNpaa	It will improve your chances of getting a job, period.|`|ajkMt6gRaa	I disagree.  I suggest you get a job if you don't already have one.  Also - certs are just that ... a piece of paper .  Show the people you interview with that you can perform the job.  If you can outperform a cert guy in an interview guess who gets the job ?      If you are already working with the technology become realy good at it and also one or two other things.  Flexibility is very important.  learn to handle tasks.  Learn to save the company money.  Document time savings or whatever you have accomplished.  This is more imortant than your degree or any Certification.
jOdZ7QTMaa	Directly from the IRS site: "You can treat amounts you paid during 2008 for qualified mortgage insurance as home mortgage interest. The insurance must be in connection with home acquisition debt, and the insurance contract must have been issued after 2006." If it is on your HUD, it should probably be included on your 1098 from the mortgage company. If it's not on your 1098, double check your HUD and make sure it was definitely paid at closing, and if so, contact the mortgage lender and find out why they didn't show it on your 1098 as it should be deductible.
dRezbY31aa	Yes, it is real. However, it is a defined benefits plan with many limitations. For example, if you go into the hospital they'll pay $500 per day (depending on the policy) and you'll pay the rest. The average hospital stay is $3000 per day so if you were in for 5 days you'll pay $12,500. If you are in the ICU the average cost is $8000 per day and they'll pay $500.    In my opinion the only time this plan would be beneficial to anyone is if they are uninsurable with a regular policy.
HFlytHlRaa	Honestly, it depends what type of company you're looking at. For example, it's highly unlikely a company like Microsoft would even consider somebody who graduated from Devry for several reasons:    1) It's a vocational school, the amount of coding learned there is not up to par with a traditional 4-year school. The information learned would be fairly basic.    2) You'd be competing against people who graduated from top schools. If given the choice, a large company would rather have the student who graduated from MIT than Devry.   Unless your resume is outstanding, it's unlikely you'd even be called in for an interview.    3) Devry is an institution that is more focused on making money than providing quality education. Most companies know this.   I honestly can't imagine in any instance where Devry would be taken seriously by large corporations who have their pick of the litter when it comes to hires.    Consider enrolling at a local state school instead which would put you on a more even playing ground with other computer engineers than a vocational school would.     Should you decide to go through with Devry, you should be prepared to have a stellar resume. Get started on activities and gaining experience now, you'll need it to get your foot in the door.|`|ajkMt6gRaa	devry is a vocational school.  I'd suggest against it.  You can get better training from TechSkills and if you want to appy you can go through a career skills office which will help you with grants .. applicable to achieving certain skills.     Basically devery overcharges and makes promises that have no validity in the Market Place.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	Yes, they're accredited.  Obviously DeVry is no MIT, Air Force Academy, or even a traditional university, but those highly marketed tech schools really do have sound curriculum in most of the technology fields.  You won't graduate from DeVry and start out as the Chief Information Officer of a company, but you might get a helpdesk job paying $22-23/hr when most of the helpdesk employees with high school diplomas are only getting $16-17/hr.
QXSFpMzDaa	I would call the IRS honestly.  Legally your W2 has to be in the mail by Jan. 31.  And I am sure someone in corporate can help you.  While yes, Dunkin Donuts is franchised there has to be a central office I would call customer care to start with and complain:    Write Us  Dunkin' Donuts Consumer Care  130 Royall Street  Canton, MA 02021  Tel: 800-859-5339    Or else maybe they can steer you in the write direction.  If not keep calling and demand to speak to someone in charge and find out who you can and need to talk to.|`|zTau6hDIaa	It needs to be postmarked or made available electronically by 31 January.  If you have not received it by 15 February contact the IRS - 1-800-829-1040|`|lCkGxjGXaa	Call City Hall and report it|`|qvVfIrhDaa	If you work as a contractor then you get a 1099, not a W-2.  If you are an employee, have you tried asking your employer?  It might be a paper work mix up.  They have another month to get it to you.|`|xvPsAonzaa	This year, you are supposed to receive your W-2 by Feb 2.  If you don't receive it by then you can call the IRS at 1800-829-1040 they will send Form 4598     , you can also file your taxes without it by doing a free file at Turbo Tax online.
95bHeeAgaa	The owner could file charges if he decides to go that way.  You were not filming in a public place - it is a privately owned establishment so you cannot film there without permission.      If you pulled down all the fim, and there wasn't much harm done, I wouldn't worry about it.  If that is the case, it's not worth his time or money to sue.  Especially to sue some lower level workers - who probably don't have many assets.    Be sure to bring everything down.  And just remember not to film in non-public places without owner permission going forward.    Good luck.|`|Lef6vVQAaa	I'm pretty sure that he can't press charges against you. Your friend works there, he wasn't trespassing. Did he ever sign a waiver of employment, or is there a manual that states no video cameras allowed?     If not, you're in the clear. Unless you guys made defamatory comments about him on camera , there is nothing that he can really do, legally.     However, he could fire your friend for goofing off with a video camera at work, at best.     I really wouldn't worry about. However, there must be something on the video that he doesn't want to get out ----- use that.
DGFu03Q3aa	Dear P:  You know the number is $400 to file and $600 to issue you a 1099, but consider if you have expenses you may want to file the Sch C to eliminate any income and possibly reduce your other income with al loss.    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provide. Click on my profile to read more.   Errol Quinn  Enrolled Agent   Master Tax Advisor|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	Actually, you may not get a 1099 even if you are required to file a Schedule C.  If you make at least $400 form self employment, you must file and pay self employment taxes.  You must receive $600 from a single source before a 1099 is required.|`|AA10469473	Even if you don't get a 1099, if you make over $400 for the year from self employment you have to file a schedule C or C-EZ.  If you are filing a return for some other reason, including if you are filing joint with a spouse, there is no bottom limit, you have to file the C if you have ANY self employment income.    A company doesn't have to send you a 1099 if they paid you under $600 for the year, although they can if they want to.  If they don't, you'd file from your own records of what they paid.|`|deef86f1312d6aa410da26db3ce34134aa	Not quite.  A 1099 is required when you make more than $600 from one employer.  A Schedule C is required when you make even $1.  A Schedule SE is also required when you make $400.  So take your pick based upon your honesty.

ZRG7wEf9aa	Where are you?  Look on http://www.craigslist.com.  I found a broker that was willing to list my property on the MLS for a flat fee of $350.  I won't ever be paying her a % commission.     if you have a hot piece of property, you might find a buyer that is doing their own looking on the web, like at www.realtor.com.   Always have the papers drawn up with the help of a professional.  That way you don't have to worry about being sued 5 years from now for undisclosed problems with your property.  Best wishes for a quick sale..

GE6vqqF8aa	I have not used debt consolidation, but I've known people who have. I really need more specific info?

AA10685337	Don't you negotiate that with the bank?
A3I4UJQyaa	Hi there,    The 1099's usually come in 3, 4, or 5-part sets.      Copy A (in red) should be the only one you cannot cut or separate. These copies should be sent to the IRS with your summary Form 1096 by 3/2.    Copy B (for recipient) and Copy 2 (if necessary) should be perforated so that you can separate and send to individual vendors.     Copy C is to keep for your records but can be separated if you want. I like to keep them together because the full pages are easier to hold on to than the individual 1099's.    Good luck!|`|wADsOOILaa	The top sheet should not be cut.  It is sent along with Form 1096 to IRS.  The lower copies certainly may be separated as they will be sent to different recipients.   Be sure to keep the employer copy, which you can separate or not, depending on how you want to keep it in your files.
wADsOOILaa	From your question I can't be sure when you were married and divorced.  If you were legally single on 12-31-08 you will file as Single.  If you were married on that date, you can file Married Filing Separately or Married Filing Jointly if your husband agrees.  If single, you cannot claim him since he apparently made over $3500 during the year.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	If the medical bills were in your name you might be able to go to over to htpp://www.irs.gov|`|AA11125470	no you can't claim expenses related to him because you aren't married and he isn't considered a dependent.

AA10442322	AUD has weaken considerably against USD, from a height of 0.9851 (achieved on 15th July 2008) to a low of 0.6007 (27th Oct 2008). Not for the AUD Government's intervention, it could fall lower than that.     It is now hovering around 0.64 to 0.71 (range bound). Reserve Bank of Australia will be holding a meeting on 3rd Feb 2009 to discuss their interest rates - currently at 4.25%. It is highly possible that they may cut the rate further to 3.25% (New Zealand cut their interest rate from 5% to 3.5% - the lowest since March 1999) to combat the current economic turmoil.    Traditionally, if you convert after the announcement date, USD would strengthen further and AUD may fall from its current spot at 0.6625. Please bear in mind that AUD is one of the 3 commodities currencies (CAD, NZD & AUD), so if you want to convert, please look at the commodities' prices to give you a gauge. Lately, I have also noticed a relationship between the Dow Jones Index and the AUD. if DJI rises, AUD would rise too. I reckon it could be the effects of carry trades.     Finally, if you convert now at 0.6625 you will get AUD 15094 and convert at 0.6007, you will get AUD 16647. So its your call, the difference is not substantial. If I am in no hurry, I will convert after the announcement on 3rd Feb 2009.|`|5WzklgiBaa	If you are serious to invest, google for HSFX Asset Management and start making money!|`|yaq7oaH6aa	The U.S. dollar is about to take a big hit, with the Government   pumping all that extra cash into the economy.

H E ? email  posted Thursday, 22 May 2008  When one person "clings" to another person "psychologically", the person who is being "clinged to" RESENTS and REJECTS the needy, clingy emotional parasite...    This is WUSS behavior at its worst.    If a guy/girl is on the phone with a girl/guy he just met, and she/he says "Hey, I have to go", he might say "Aw, well... um... OK. Um, will you call me when you get home?".    Or let's say a guy and a girl are out on their first date, and they're walking around in a large department store.    Most guys will follow the woman everywhere, and not leave her side for a minute.    If she wanders away, he'll come find her IMMEDIATELY.    He'll stay physically close to her, as if he's afraid she'll leave without him.    And an even worse example is a guy who is so emotionally insecure that he actually ASKS a woman to tell him that he's nice, fun, interesting, etc.    "Do you think I'm interesting?"    "Do you think we could ever have a relationship?"    "Am I your type?"    Women HATE this stuff. It makes them shiver with the heebie-jeebies. It makes them want to RUN AWAY.    David D

At this time visit IRS website www.irs.gov and use the withholding calculator to see how many you can claim on your W4, then download form W4 and give to your employer to change your withholding, so next year you don't have to wait on IRS to send you a refund.  At this time IRS is processing only your return be patient, if you don't receive your refund in 20 days then there is a problem with your tax return, or you didn't file all your tax returns from previous years.|`|wADsOOILaa	Assuming your return was accepted before the noon (or 11:00 a.m.) cutoff on Thursday, your refund will be directly deposited to your account 8 days later on Friday.

AA10464818	You'll be hard pressed to find a grant to support the timeoff for writing a book.     You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.    Find a publisher who can give you an advance. Forget about grants|`|fECovy3Laa	If you're asking about a government grant, it's extremely hard to get one for a personal business.  Writing your own book would be a personal business.

AA10469473	If you file as married filing separately, you can't take a Hope or Lifetime Learning credit.    Even if you file jointly, you don't get back ALL the money you paid for tuition and fees, just some of it.    Stick with school.

Good luck.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Yeah you should file seperate then..  married filing sepearte.

I'll see if I can find out anything more specific and amend this answer if I do.    Next time you really should try direct deposit as it is faster and free.

3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:    1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.    In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.     Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.    Good luck!
vHB9zUcCaa	Do some research on the business before the interview. (See "How to Find a Job," "Research the Employer.")    Practice interviewing.    Go alone. Do not take children or friends.    Greet the employer with a handshake.    Make frequent eye contact.    Smile, be polite, and try to relax.    Listen carefully to the questions asked. Ask the interviewer to restate a question if you are confused.    Answer questions as directly as possible.    Be upbeat and make positive statements.    If you've worked before, talk about what you learned from it.    Use examples of how your skills and abilities would fit the job.    Bring your "Fact Sheet" with telephone numbers and addresses of your references and former employers, just in case you are asked to complete an application.     Questions to Expect (What the Employer May Ask You):       1. Tell me about yourself. (This is often an ice-breaker question. Keep the answer job or skill related.)     2. What do you know about the type of work we do? (This is your chance to tell what you know from the research you completed ahead of time.)     3. What is your weakness? (Always make this a positive answer. For example, "My spelling is not always perfect, so I always use a spell checker.")     4. What are your strengths? (Describe your skills in a way that will show you as a desirable employee for the company.)     5. Why did you leave your last job? ( Answer with a positive statement. Try not to say: "I was fired," "terminated," "quit," "had no babysitter," or "couldn't get along with coworkers or supervisor". However, you can say: "new job," "contract ended," "seasonal," "temporary," "career change," "returned to school," to raise a family," or "relocated.")     6. Why have you been unemployed for such a long time? (Tell the truth. Emphasize that you were looking for a good company where you can settle and make a contribution.)     7. Why should we hire you? (Make a positive statement, such as "I would like the opportunity to work with you and believe that I can do the work.")     8. Do you have references? (It is most important that you contact your references ahead of time and have their name, current address, and telephone numbers.)    Questions To Ask The Employer:       1. Who would supervise me?     2. When are you going to make a hiring decision?     3. What are the opportunities for advancement?     4. What kind of training is provided or available?     5. Is there a dress code?      Two men in business suits seated at a conference table.       Pitfalls (Reasons Why People Don't Get Hired):        * Untidy personal appearance      * Inability to express information clearly      * Lack of genuine interest or enthusiasm      * Unwillingness to start at the bottom      * Negative attitude      * Lack of eye contact      * Incomplete or sloppy application      * Being late for the interview    Closing    At the end of the interview:        * Thank the interviewers for their time.      * Request a business card.      * Shake hands in closing.      * Two or three days after the interview send a thank you note addressed to the interviewers.            Thank You Notes    After your interview, be sure to write a thank you note to the employer or interviewer. This is very important because a thank you note gives you one more chance to remind the employer about the special skills that you can bring to the company.    It is a good idea to request the interviewer's business card before leaving the interview. This will help when writing your thank you note to correctly spell the interviewer's name and job title.    Tips for thank you notes:             1. Neatly hand write or type the note.     2. Address the note to the interviewer or the lead interviewer.     3. Keep it short. (No longer than one page.)     4. First paragraph: Thank the employer for the interview. Also, mention that you are interested in the position.     5. Second paragraph: Briefly state a few of your skills without repeating the information on your resume word for word. Include any important information not mentioned at the interview.     6. Third paragraph: Provide your contact information, telephone number with area code, and an e-mail address, if available.     7. Sign the note with your first and last name.     8. Proofread the note to check for spelling or grammar errors. Ask another person to proofread the note.     9. Mail the note within two to three days after your interview.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	don't dodge questions. take your time answering. be honest. ask questions back but don't ask what the company does, don't ask about policy on vacation/sick time other than if they offer it, don't be the one to volunteer salary requirements, wait for them to ask.  and if they ask your expectations, hopefully you did some homework and know what the going salary/rate is for the position you're applying for. if you do, answer it honestly.  be on time, dress for the occasion. be polite and courteous. and try to relax. show confidence but not *********. if you dn't know the answer to a question, don't pretend you do. just say you'r enot sure how to answer the question, can you rephrase or elaborate, can i have a moment to think about that question.  point is, don't BS an answer.|`|XTwI4F64aa	Over the phone -    The tone of your voice is very important.

Whether they will actually do so depends on a few things.  1)  Did you fill out a W-4 when you started working there?  2)  When you worked, did they withhold income taxes and social security taxes?  3)  Did you earn more than $500?  If the answer to all 3 questions is no, you probably won't receive a W-2 from them.    They are supposed to mail them by January 31, but they probably won't get in any trouble if it's a few days later.

Z8qBgv8taa	It is a foul play if they are doing this. They also could just be very detail oriented and not miss a beat. If they are being dishonest while your chances for an audit are EXTREMELY LOW  For example in 2008 .81% of those with income less than $25,000 were audited.  .58% of those $25,000-$50,000   .62%of those $50,000-$100,000  1.66% of those Greater than $100,000    I would advise looking over all of their work before they send it off as a precaution. There are certain flags the IRS look for each year. The consultants are probably aware of which flags to avoid. Check check again and triple check to be sure you aren't being set up for trouble later on though. The IRS can and will go back years and audit you even 10 years down the road.|`|ITNq8WU9aa	As a tax consultant, I am always looking for more business.    At least I can only speak for myself, I will not put my clients in jeopardy to get them bigger refunds. I will follow the law and take deductions that they are entitled to. I will not take more then they are allowed.    There are grey area where one can claim deductions, but other areas are just black and white.    This comes with doing taxes for awhile. If you are talking being audited, then you need to find another financial consultant.    That is not what I am about.
ZeDjn4cVaa	I understand the IRS position on two years of post-secondary education to refer to two academic years worth of courses.  If at the school you attended, an academic your equalled 30 hours of instruction, then you would no longer be in your first two years of post-secondary eduction after you have completed 60 credit hours.  You are allowed the hope credit in two calendar years.      Generally, therefore, if you have not completed the two academic years worth of courses by the start of a calendar year (January 1), then you would still be considered to have freshman or sophmore status during that calendar year.

See my profil|`|DIVW5oDYaa	Jennifer,    You have a complicated situation.  Best way to answer your question is to look at the intent of the tax law.    The intent was for people to claim the Hope Credit twice. The assumption was that for conventional students, this would be done after their freshman and sophomore years.    You have claimed the Hope once.  So, you should go ahead and claim the credit again.    Just make sure you have documentation of the money that you paid to the educational institution for permissible expenses (primarily tuition).     That's my two cents based on my Advanced certification as a volunteer tax preparer through the AARP Tax-Aide program.    Congratulations on your associate's degree.

wtiaBSjQaa	No they do not have to claim you. However, you need to understand that your parents will either save alot of money or get a bigger refund for claiming you. I am sure it will be alot more for them claiming you than if you claimed yourself. So the right thing to do would be to thank them for letting you live in their house rent free since you can't afford your own place. Otherwise go on and argue with them over a few hundred bucks and claim yourself.

Additionally, if they do not claim you, you may lose whatever medical and dental insurance you are receiving under their policy.

You can carryover the unused part to the next year and treat it as if you had incurred in that next year. When you carry over a loss, it remains long term or short term. A long term capital loss you carry over to the next tax year will reduce that year's long-term capital gains before it reduces that year's short-term capital gains. When you are figuring your capital loss carryover, use your short-term capital losses first.   Read http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/04/list...

K1ahDOoeaa	You sound like a candidate for FHA.  They're government insured mortgages and can be had with very little down payment.  They're more expensive than "conventional" loans but FHA is almost certainly the way you're going to have to go.  Talk to your bank or a good mortgage broker.      BTW, you might be able to use your husband's income as well.  It depends on what you mean by his credit being "shot".  FHA is pretty flexible as long as it's old stuff.    Hope this helps.|`|UeLigNB0aa	Well if you can not come up with the 3.5% for a down payment for an FHA loan (this can be a gift from family) the other option depending on where you are looking to buy would be a USDA loan.
WNPGVpQWaa	Well honestly the only reason why corn detasseling pays good money is b/c it's really hard work ( I live in Nebraska and did it one summer too) Any where else you get a summer job is going to be allot easier and won't pay as well. I would say your next best thing to do is mow lawns for some of the elderly people in your neighborhood, or work for a lawn mowing business. It's still hard work ( but not as hard as detassling) and you get paid good money!  I would suggest trying to do it on your own in your neighborhood before working for a company, b/c then you can make your own hours and you won't have to wait for a paycheck! Good luck|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|ltg4YHRsaa	I always made a lot of money landscaping - mowing lawns, planting flowers, aerating, trimming shrubs, etc.  You can work for a landscaping company first to see if you like it, and how everything is done.

1wV2sANcaa	That depends on the agent. I don't care how many houses I show someone. Buying a house is the biggest decision you will ever make. There are people who will decide within the first house or 2 and others who need to look at 30 to 40 or even more before they make a decision. A good agent is always previewing homes anyway so going with a client to a bunch of houses before they make a decision is not ever a waste of time or money. It lets you get some of them in your mind for other clients. I take notes on every house I show or preview.|`|JZG7vpUlaa	It depends.  Sometimes people are just really picky, and that's OK.

I view it as my own responsibility to size up my clientele & determine whether they're: 1) serious and 2) able.  If they're both, there is essentially no amount of house hunting that will turn me away from them.    I know of agents who do "get pissed" because they are spending their time & gasoline on someone, but they should actually just be grateful to have a buyer client to be working with in the first place...if you're gracious enough to be giving me the shot, I'm grateful and will show it through having enough respect to be patient and not pressure you.    Through my own experience, I have found that some of my "slower" buyers are also some of my best referral sources.  Because they spend a lot of time with you, more of a relationship develops...when they inevitably wind up talking real estate with family, friends or colleagues, your name is very likely to come up and generally good things get said about you...this type of word-of-mouth is very powerful!  Not only that, but if you put in the time as an investment in that relationship, you stand a very good chance at their future sales business too (and they're not always going to be slow...finances change over time, and many people who are slow are first timers...they have a whole life of business ahead of them to offer as they step up).    Patience pays.  Besides, where do some of these agents get their sense of entitlement anyway?  What, people are just supposed to pour out hundreds of thousands of dollars on the 3rd or 4th showing just because the agent wants to get paid quick?    If you're a buyer asking this question, don't feel bad.  It shows consideration to acknowledge it in conversation, but don't feel bad...or pressured.  It's not supposed to be that way.    If you're an agent asking this question, shame on you.
eACZ1Rhjaa	First you will need a business license and sales tax number from your state and maybe city. A food handlers permit probably with a TB test at least and some food safety training. You won't make your own food in your kitchen because you don't have a commercial kitchen with inspections you will need to rent a kitchen.    If you have a roach couch that is a catering truck with a kitchen you could cook in that but not at home.    We had this service where I worked before and it does seem like a good idea. That lady had a handcart/dolly and two ice chest. Early in the morning she rented a tavern kitchen to make salads and sandwiches then she loaded the cold food and beverages into ice chest with ice. She sold canned pop and some bottled juice and packaged rice krispy squares and big cookies I think the tavern made and packaged. She would park and put her ice chest on the hand cart and bring it in the building. The receptionist would announce her over the loud speakers and anyone who wanted to buy would come to the lobby. She arrived about 10am but people know already if they want to buy lunch.    So her day was probably started at 5-6AM with deliveries from 8-12:30 or so, not a lunch time only thing.     I wouldn't buy from someone I thought was making food in a home kitchen with children and pets in the house.

Their website (http://www.onepricedodge.com/) does not specifically promote the BOGO offer, which got them a lot of publicity.

This is an extreme form of advertising and not many car dealerships will try this. Best bet is to watch your local news to see if any dealers in your immediate area decide to try this approach.

They get all sorts of stuff by writing a formal professional letter to their customer service or community contacts and simply ask.    You will be surprised at the results. Keep the letter very professional and with a letterhead.  The more official you are, the more likely they will sponsor you.    Oh, and another thing, always start this at the beginning of the year, if you start later in the year, they might have run out of the sponsorship funds.|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	Ask the one's you are buying from to give you a quantity discount. Even if you only spent $10 a person you are going to be spending $6,000 and with alcohol you are more likely to spend closer to 60,000 for a party that size. So if you were to spend say 10,000 on a catered picnic you might ask them to throw in free napkins or free desert. Where I am you can get a case price on liquor but you will need to be careful children aren't served.  You might consider making it pot luck or each family bring their own food and drink. At least make it BYOB to save thousands since free booze can get out of control fast.

y7Mwptsraa	On your Canadian income tax return, you can only claim moving expenses on a move out of the country if you are considered a factual or deemed resident.     A factual resident is someone employed by a government in Canada and posted to work abroad, like a member of the military, or a member of a staff at a Canadian embassy located in a foreign country.     A deemed resident is someone who was living in Canada for at least 183 days during a calendar year, has no residential ties to Canada, and has no residential ties to any other country.    On the other hand, if you are not a resident of Canada, you don't have to report your foreign income on your Canadian return.|`|5dXsErAaaa	If your filling in Canada claim your moving expenses on form T1M    US taxes paid use form FTC|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Yes, you are required to declare all worldly income.

UeLigNB0aa	Medical bills are always disregarded when it comes to FHA financing but these collections will affect your credit score. You may find it more difficult to find a lender if your score is under a 620 mid score. I have already had 2 different major lenders change their credit score requirements in the last 2 weeks from 580 to 600 or 620. I still have a few that will go under 580 but I fear that it wont be long before more lenders jump on this wagon.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	It might. Go to a couple banks and find out if they'll give you a loan. If they say no, pay off the medical bills and then try for a loan again. It worked for me.|`|3ed5a0850a3ad3e8ff1beaeea841b592aa	medical bills usually hurt less than other debts.

K1ahDOoeaa	"Familial status" is a protected class under Fair Housing laws.  What they're describing may sound "reasonable" to someone who owns a house and doesn't want it "trashed by college students" but it's almost certainly illegal.  I know it is for long term rentals.  Vacation rentals I couldn't tell you for sure but I bet it is.|`|rrp9c2tnaa	That means they will not rent to a group of college students looking for a party house, etc.  They will rent to one-family vacationers.
UeLigNB0aa	Because of the source of the down payment you should not need to season it. Provide proof that it will be from your tax refund and should be fine.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	You can use a tax refund for a down payment on a house, however $5,000 sounds on the low side for a down payment.  If you have other money in savings, then use that for the earnest money/deposit, and use the $5,000 when you get to closing.  It will take you at least that long to get through closing.  February 6th is pretty close.  I think if you write a contract, and get an inspection, and otherwise use up some time, you should be able to get to use those funds.|`|K1ahDOoeaa	Your tax refund is absolutely OK for this.  It's your money.  "Seasoning" is all about having money for a long enough period the banks don't care where it came from, usually 60 days (more precisely they figure it's been yours long enough no one lent it to you for this purchase).  Money that's not seasoned will need to be sourced.  Came as a loan from your uncle?  No good.  Money from a job, tax refund, sold something (a car, etc.), and so forth is absolutely ok.    Hope this helps.

5Gxll9Hkaa	Well, the main thing to remember about "debt consolidation" is that you can't borrow your way out of debt.      Consolidating your debts will not reduce the amount you owe, although sometimes - SOMETIMES ... and you need to be careful - it is possible to reduce the INTEREST RATE you are paying through debt consolidation.  It will not reduce the principal  amount that you still owe, though.    So the question here is: what is it that is killing your budget:  the interest rate you are paying on your debts, or the total amount of debt itself?  If the answer is, "the total amount of debt itself" then consolidation won't help you.    I would suggest that you make an appointment - in person, face-to-face - with a legitimate (usually non-profit) certified credit counselor to review your situation.  Not knowing how much you earn, it is impossible to tell whether your debt is repayable or not.  But it does sound as though you and your wife are working a lot of hours, some of which may need to be cut back when your child is born.  So the question is: after the baby comes, will you be able to give your child the benefit of actually knowing his or her parents, or will you still (both) need to be working at multiple jobs just to barely keep your heads above water (and pay child care expenses)?    You need to actually sit down and do the math to figure this out.  You can't just guess.    It sounds to me as though you may be a candidate for bankruptcy, and making an appointment with a bankruptcy attorney (most offer one free or very low cost appointment to review your specific situation) can get you an expert opinion from that perspective.    Some debts (notably: domestic support obligations and student loans) cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, so WHAT KIND of debts you have may be a factor in what will turn out to be the best solution too.    Good luck, and congratulations on your marriage and forthcoming child.

pt6wIlS1aa	Okay, I'm not  pharmacist, would not want to be one, but I know about choosing careers and being happy and unhappy in a job, and also about wanting to make a good living.    You're in 10th grade. You do not have to make a final choice now. Take the attitude that you are considering pharmacy, that you are leaning towards it, not that you've made a permanent commitment to it. Explore other careers, too.    Pharmacy involves chemistry, but it's not quite the same thing. And doing something in the real world isn't the same as learning it in school. You already recognize that your chemistry teacher isn't conducive to giving you a love for chemistry, so you know that it will be different in college, when you have a better teacher.    Pharmacy also involves healthcare and pharmacists are increasingly responsible as consultants on the right medications for a patient's conditions. Does that interest you?     Math is a great thing to love, and there are a variety of careers that pay well for people who want to do math for a living.  Actuaries (http://www.beanactuary.org/) make good money (http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=... ).  Statisticians work in many industries, including for the government and the United Nations. http://www.amstat.org/careers/ Salary depends on industry.  Consider being an engineer, perhaps a chemical engineer or a computer engineer, both of which use math. Engineers are well paid and in demand.  Even being a math teacher pays well, better than average, because they're in demand. http://www.maa.org/careers/    Do some research. And realize that you will have some time in college to take other courses before you even enter a pharmacy program.

Some cards MAY lower your rate and others might just cancel you or lower your available credit line or ignore your request (all of these are becoming common).

If appliances aren't built in you can take them just like you will your other furniture and personal belongings.|`|K1ahDOoeaa	Actually I look at a lot of foreclosed homes and about 50% or so have the stove missing.  Some have the dishwasher gone, etc.      Is the bank going after these people for taking them?  No.  Should they have taken them?  Kind of hard for me to say.  Some, like the poster above, would say only if you bought it later.  Stoves, however, in an average home just roll out and plug in.  They're personal property. Really not different than a fridge on a modern average sized house and many people take those when they sell.    I'd say if you feel it's yours take it.  The bank won't chase you.  If you don't feel it's yours leave it.    Hope this helps.
FhSKRB7Kaa	Sometimes even if you don't have a real experience it is better to cook up things.

It might sound cooked up but there is no right answer for these questions.    All you have to remember during interviews like these is that you should be ready to get yourself out when cornered.

Go clean the bathrooms, mop, vacuum, decide what you're having for lunch and make a shopping list.  Wash the apparatus.  Find out what is on the drill schedule for the day.

In theory, this will put thousands of construction workers that are presently unemployed back to work building highways, bridges, and light rail lines.

DAMZKbpDaa	IF he didn't make enough to file, he doesn't owe.     The IRS will do a computer  screening on unfiled income. If the computer anayzes that he probably won't owe, they usually don't pursue it. They have limited resources and want to get the most (tax) return for their effort. That is the good news.    The bad news is that, if he does owe a significant amount, the IRS has no statute of limitation on collecting on unfiled returns. Plus penalty and interest. They can go back the whole 14 years.    Just for peace of mind, he should prepare the unfiled returns just to see if he owes. He may find he is due a refund. He can only get the refunds for 2005 (if he files before 4/15), 2006 and 2007.     If it turns out the IRS is looking for him, you can file the Injured Spouse form and at least get your portion of the refund back.|`|AA11284831	If he's been working at jobs subject to withholding and has not heard from the IRS, most likely he has forgone thousand and may be tens of thousands in refunds that he would have otherwise been entitled to.

He can either get copies of his W-2s from his employers or request an earnings transcript form the IRS.    If any taxes are due for prior years there will be late filing penalties and penalties for late payment plus interest.  Only the last 6 years returns need to be filed if there is a balance due.  As a matter of policy the IRS does not pursue taxes older than 6 years where no return has been filed.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	You should go to your local IRS office or call.

(3) Prepare tax returns to each of those years using the information from the IRS transcripts and any other information that you husband has.   (4) You may decide not to submit them unless they show a balance due or a reasonable refund. But even if he owes nothing, it could be advisable to submit them in order to begin the three year time period on the statute of limitation.  Then in three years, if you have heard nothing, you know that all the years for which the IRS has records are closed and no claim can be made against your husband.    Richard K  Master Tax Advisor  HR Block    This advice was prepared based upon the law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts provided by you.  See my profile for more information.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	2 reasons to file a return ,if you owe tax and if your owed a refund.,after you file a flag might go up then you will get a letter telling you what to do next .or it might go through with no notice. soon the statute of limitations will pass and you won't need to worry.|`|KdYml46Paa	Probably just take a quick run by your local H & R Block or whatever other tax place is near you.  Or you can try to use software like Quicken if you want to do it at your convenience but a professional can give you a definitive answer.|`|x6wsmJQGaa	Go to your local IRS office tell them that he needs to file and they can help him through the process and find out if he owes anything.  They can also help you set up a payment plan if he does end up owing.|`|9eEHl8Z1aa	you could always call the garnishment number and see if it says anything on there it should say if he owes money 1800 304 3107 call there and if it says nothing and your still unsure contact the IRS|`|91ff4dbbfbd7827f11b99d3972e133e1aa	You need to go to your local tax pro and ask him to explain about  Injured spouse or innocent spouse form, this is a relief for many  wives whose husbands owe support or loans that you are not  responsible for, but also be prepared if he doesnt want to file, then  you still have to file on your side, if there are any children, to get the  EIC and child tax credit. If you do want to talk to irs you can always  call 1-800-829-1040, but if you ask them about his non payment of  taxes he could well start getting leters or even go to jail.  Unless when he worked those years, he made under a certain  amount he probably doesnt file, or maybe a 1099 worker, but I think  if you call them its just going to open a can of worms for you too.  If I were you i would file first then call maybe after tax season is  over or ask J.Hewitt  or hrblock about the form I mentioned above.  Because once you file with him, the last 3 yrs from him will be  probably audited or reviewed then all your refund is fair game also.

If you don't think you should be discriminated against ~ and I'm relatively sure you don't ~ (no matter the shade of your skin); then, it would be understood that no person is appropriately discriminated.    there are no Pros for this behaviour choice and the list of cons have 100's of books published on the topic.|`|DOgW8MHCaa	sounds like a teacher who is a racist|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	That is what is called affirmative action.  There are many cases where this is appropriate but many where it is not.  White males discriminated against all other races and women for many years, shouldn't those who were discriminated against have the opportunity to catch up.  But once they are caught up in certain job category affirmative action should end.  We no longer need to have affirmative action for President of the United States.
lhH7vynGaa	Well, if you  really think it's worth protecting, look into getting a provisional patent. I think it's good for a year and then you can get a patent pending, which costs a lot more. You can renew the provisional yearly, though.    Go to Legalzoom.com and they will answer better.

vqdurAA5aa	Technically, it still applies.    However, since it does not make any difference in your tax computation, no one (not even the IRS) cares if you apply it or not.     I know of one day trader who always takes off the entire month of December (holding no positions for ove 31 days) to make sure he does not have to worry about wash sales.|`|4gMdp2nwaa	The wash sale rule will apply for any trades that you did between Jan - June (eg buying ETFC within a month of selling it during that time). However, it will not come into effect if you take more that a month off. For example if you were to buy ETFC in Feb 09, you do not have to worry about any sales made from Dec 09 being counted against you. (I'm assuming you want to take a tax loss and make sure it won't effect your new position in that stock).
DbRhfYVSaa	It would be better for your parents to claim you as a dependent because your income is below the poverty level.|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	I would work it both ways to be sure.  If they claim you they will get the credit(this years stimulus will be a credit).  If you are not sure ask them if you can do your taxes with them so you get everything right then ask that you try it with you claiming yourself to see how it works.|`|lBw50ySpaa	Last year I claimed my son as a dependent, and he filed a return anyway.  There is a question "can anyone claim you as a dependent?" that he checked yes.  He had to pay $14 tax, but he got his stimulus check for $300.  You may want to go back and file for last year.  You may be able to get a stimulus check.    I can't remember why they didn't give me a stimulus check for him.  I think because he was over 17.  Ask your parents if they got an stimulus for you, and ask a pro.
0Idp3oSSaa	Laptop|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Depends on what you already have. And what you really need.  You can always save up your money, you may come across something you really want, and you'll have the money to buy it.    If you don't already have a laptop and feel you need one, get the laptop.    If you already have a pretty recent mobile phone (like 3 or 4 years old only) you don't need a new one and that would just be a waste of money, but it also depends how often you use your phone and what you use it for.    Anyways just take into consideration which one you need more and what benefits it will have.|`|8bqhCw23aa	forex-  http://tradingsolution.org/|`|cp38lX51aa	Personally i think you should put the money in the bank, get 3 0r 4% interest and chill.   1. If you need a laptop then you don't really need an expensive one. They all work fine.    2.If your phone can talk and text then you have a fine phone. No need to be wasting money in today's economy where you could not be able to afford a meal tommorow.    You should go by yourself some nice clothes and a pair of shoes and then put your money in the bank so you can buy an even better laptop in a year, and still have extra $$$|`|jw8Pwe1Naa	Personally, I would suggest choice number two, however if you don't already have a desktop, then you should go for number one. I bought a a laptop, and it was a bad investment. But that's just my opinion!
qr7LdskQaa	I would just pay it all off. If you keep doing it monthly, it'll take too long. You may as well do it now, start clean. You say you have $32K saved and owe $21K? That leaves you with $11,000. Yeah, it's not much. But it's something and you'll have the unemployment coming in too. Still, not much, but this is where proper money management comes in. How much you need vs. how much you want. Can you get by for a while on little? It is possible I do it all the time, it's matter of cutting back your personal expenses. Meanwhile, your debt is paid, you don't have that burden hanging over you. You can start fresh. And don't let it get to your credit report if you start missing payments for whatever reason. Especially now! Credit stuff is worse than ever. That's another reason to pay it off. You never know what may happen and when. Suppose you have something major come up such as illness, probably unlikely, but nothing surprises me anymore. Then you can no longer make monthly payments. Do it now, get it done. Over with. Have some peace about it.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Can you pay your bills? If your answer is yes I would advise paying your debt off. If your answer is no, I would advise looking into credit counseling if you have credit card debt. They can reduce your payments. It worked for me. Just make sure you find a reputable agency.    You are going to want to hold on to some of your savings because finding a job is not very easy right now. I would advise keeping at least 6-9 months of living expenses in savings.|`|dzBr9kPFaa	If your debt is a reasonable interest rate, then you should conserve your cash and just pay the minimum each month.  Once you have a steady paycheck again, then you can pay off the debt.  If you have any high interest debt (say 12% or higher) then the decision is a bit tougher.   Good luck in the job search.|`|36UDdHFzaa	pay off debt!!!! then never look back. :) pay everything in cash afterwards... no credit :) lol

Gun3UGzaaa	If you haven't had your court hearing yet (for her suit against him for $500) then bring your evidence about her having no intention to pay the bills, and take your chances.  It is not likely that a court will approve her judgement if she is double dipping on the same bills.    If the divorce is final, the document should have addressed all marital debt.  If she signed the divorce agreeing that the bills on the divorce were all that were owed, then she can't come back later and get more.  So, bring the divorce agreement as well.|`|b2338l9Maa	Yes you do. SHE wouldn't have to pay YOU b/c she's filing bankruptcy, but YOU do have to pay her.    However, small claims like these are in general hard to enforce. You might get away without paying, if she's too lazy to report you and your husband to the courts.|`|AA11598210	~~The bankruptcy discharged her debts not yours. So legally you would need to pay her.    If you don't she can take you to small claims, and try to get a judgment against you. She would have to show the court some proof you owe her this money to get a judgment though.~~

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	California was quite similar to the Federal in the past but in the last 20 years they have diverged in so many ways that you can go back and forth on which you owe and which you get refunds.

DAMZKbpDaa	So, who pays the most rent/mortgage in your household? If you three live together at the same address (household) you are one household.     What WI doesn't want is all three of you claiming that address. Decide who pays the most among you. Or draw straws, if you must.    Edit:  NO, it means you claim your rent/mortgage, but only up to 24.5K MAXIMUM. So for most people, it is 24.5K they are claiming.|`|deef86f1312d6aa410da26db3ce34134aa	Household no doubt means you and your dependents.  As long as no one else at that address claims the credit you should be able to if you qualify.|`|NXzwF8JPaa	You can each claim the credit based on the rent you pay and your own income. You don't combine your income. See the definitions below.    Household  - Household -- If you are single, you are considered a household, whether you live alone or with others. If you are married, you and your spouse are considered a household if you live together. If you are married but you and your spouse maintained separate homes on December 31, 2008, you are each considered a separate household.    Household Income - Household income is all your income reportable for Wisconsin income tax purposes and all the items identified on lines 9a through 11i of Schedule H (lines 6a through 6i of Schedule H?EZ), less a deduction of $250 for each qualifying dependent.    If you were married and lived with your spouse during all of 2008, you must combine both incomes to determine household income. If during 2008 you were separated from your spouse for all or part of the year (including one spouse living in a nursing home), you became married or divorced, or your spouse died,  see the Special Instructions on pages 15 and 16 for information on how to determine household income.

There are also city that accept PT police officers as well but its possible to do both.
DbRhfYVSaa	Here is a 10K foot explanation.  Marketing as a whole happens before sales.  Product support and customer handholding is post sales.    Presales roles include Market Development (or strategic marketing) which you are unlikely to find in the current economy. For a firm that works with gov't contracts such as Boeing or SAIC, you would be looking at lobbying. In the private sector, you would be dealing with strategic alliances, regulatory developments, Patents, time to revenue. This usually requires an individual who has 10-12 years of experience in the industry.  Then you have Market Communications which includes PR but also a lot of pre and post sales docummentation. You would be dealing with the wording, Trade Marks and the implied liabilities as well as printing and distribution.  Product Marketing has become in recent years Product Operations because the individual is given very little leverage or say in the direction of the product. It used to be a fun job. Now it is a secure job if you do not worry much about the rewards and just want a steady paycheck.     Best Bet for your would be Product Marketing. WHY?  Because you enjoy seeing the cradle-to-grave process ... if you do, of course.  Good luck to you

yUxh8Eozaa	you are right, most everywhere takes debit, you can even run it as a credit if they take credit only because it just goes straight out of your account    you need to watch out online when using a debit card because its easier for people to steal than credit|`|pt6wIlS1aa	You have it right, but there's more to it. To work like that, the debit card must be a VISA or Mastercard. And since it is a VISA or Mastercard, it can also be used like a credit card, although the money still comes out of your account.    When it's done as a debit transaction, you enter your PIN into the machine and the money is deducted from your account immediately.    When a place doesn't have a PIN machine, they will have you sign a slip just as if it were a credit card. It takes a few days for the money to be removed from your account in this case.    Every store that accepts VISA and Mastercard should take your debit card. They won't necessarily even know that it's a debit card and not a credit card.    The only time it makes a difference is when you're reserving a hotel room or a rental car, because these places want to be able to put holds on your account in case you damage their property. They may put a larger hold on your account than the expected fee, or they may not accept the debit card.|`|U3vVGSoKaa	I only know of checking accounts to which the debit card is attached.  Some retailers do not accept debit cards. Such as car rental agencies.|`|hlmHi3Dqaa	credit card basically is the same as debit, except in debit its being taken straight outa ur bank account    if you get a debit card through chase at least, it comes from VISA so everybody accepts it and i treat it just like a credit card
wQJBFcluaa	Yes,he could legally...depending on how the judge set it.I know some people who get to claim their child every other year.Check your divorce papers and see what it states.    I don't think it would have any effect on your getting government assistance.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	If there is a divorce decree, if the judge said, "husband gets to claim" or something similar, you need to follow that decree, and give your ex a Form 8332.    If there wasn't a divorce decree, since you are the custodial parent, you get priority in claiming. For your ex to claim your daughter, he would need to get a signed Form 8332 from you. With that permission only, he could claim her.    Even at that, he could only get the exemption and child tax credit.    It is possible, depending on your income, support, and residency, that your dad might be able to claim you and your daughter. If you had no earned income, it might work out better that way.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Him filing her would not effect your eligibility for gov. assistance or financial aid.  In child support orders and divorce decrees, claiming taxes on children are usually mentioned to determine who can claim a child on taxes.  Some parents alternate between the two and others only the custodial parent will.  If there is no order, and if you have not filed your daughter already, it actually isnt illegal for him to file.  Since you didnt work, filing before he does doesnt matter.  But if he does file it will not affect your eligibility for assistance.  His income doesnt affect your financial aid...unless you were getting over 1000 a month in child support maybe.   If you think it would be a problem in the future I would go to court about filing the child in the future because i can become a problem if its not settle already|`|ITNq8WU9aa	I know the first part of your question, If your daughter is living with you then you are the custodial parent, if he wants to claim her, then he has to get a release from you that he has to attach to his tax return.  I think its IRS form 8332.|`|91ff4dbbfbd7827f11b99d3972e133e1aa	Only the person or parent who has custody gets to claim the child  in return, he cant prove that child lived with him. Also if dad works  depending on income he could claim you and child on return.  I also agree with others, yu have to check your divorce decree, if it  states that husband is sharing custody or support, he will be able to  file with daughter this year.|`|AA10469473	He can only claim her if he has a valid court order saying he can, or if you give him written permission.  Without either of those, he can't claim her - you can, or your dad can.|`|qBCGH52haa	Only the custodial parent gets to claim the child as a deduction.|`|QumYk1kdaa	No, support is not an issue. When there is a dispute over who claims the child, the IRS defaults to the custodial parent.|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	Your divorce should say who gets the deduction. You may not qualify anyhow unless you provided more than half the support. Assistance you get doesn't count as you providing it and since your dad and ex are probably both helping maybe nobody supports her more than half.  You should get any assistance you qualify for no matter who claims her.|`|sIL7H8RBaa	By IRS guidelines, in order to claim a child as your dependent on your tax return, they have to have lived with you for 6 months or more out of the year.  If she has not lived with him that long, it does not matter what he pays for support.    In my opinion, the fair thing to do would be for you to claim her (to keep your benefits) if she is living with you the majority of the time, but split the child tax credit with your ex since he is helping to support her financially (but cannot claim her as a dependent).    Good Luck!

I have FMLA  when i need it and i believe that they can only fire you if you abuse the leave(like work somewhere else, vacation etc). But if you are using it for what it is meant for no, they can not lay you off. But if your company goes out of business while you are on FMLA that's different. Then They can.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Not sure but my guess would be yes.  They technically are not getting rid of you but I would not hold my breath for them to call you back.

You can send free trade related inquiry to any supplier, manufacturer or exporter.|`|jrEsCWwxaa	Because a significant component of the price of cigarettes is state taxes you will have to buy cigarettes from a wholesaler licensed to do business in the state your business is located in.

FFNIThIcaa	redit repair workd fine to fix my credit. They disputed and removed lots of bad items from my credit report. I used this service - buildcredit.ifastnet.com|`|Gun3UGzaaa	Yes, it is a horrible problem.  No one will finance a new car for you, because they lose too much money when they repo it.      Save up your money, and buy a decent used car with cash, and if the repo was more than three years ago, wait until it gets to be seven years old when it might drop off your credit report.  If you do have to take out a loan, try with a local credit union.  They tend to be more forgiving of past problems.
DAMZKbpDaa	Unless it is for a trivial amount, or it increases your earned income credit (or other credit), you will probably have to pay something back.    Wait a few weeks, and do an amended return. Don't spend all of your refund just yet.|`|0uWqjL2raa	You will need  to have an amended tax return completed to see if you are going to have to pay back.  Form 1040X is the form to use.  If you received a refund,do not spend it until you see how this will affect you.  After you have it completed,do not mail it until a few weeks after you receive your refund. You will have to complete a schedule C and possible a schedule SE along with the 1040X.  Make sure you claim your expenses. You may want to try the link below to get an estimate.  Put all of your tax information in as if you had the 1099 originally.  This should give you an estimate of how much you may have to pay back.

cToJQNknaa	Credit builder companies are a waste of money, don't give them money. All they do is dispute your negative credit and if the company doesn't report back in 30 days, then they can remove the credit. You could do the same exact thing by disputing any negative credit.|`|1P3usILUaa	Best for Business is likely American Express.  However, a credit score that is bruised can't go there.    There are cards (pre-paid Master Card or Visa card) available that you can pay a fee per month to have your transactions tracked and start building your good behaviour right away.  Its important that you live within means and continue on that road.    Business cards are issued to companies, yet, the shareholder of the company (in this case you) are still held responsible for the card and its proper use.    Hope this helps.

vzf2l8H1aa	creditreport.imess.net - try this service to boost you credit score before getting loan. After credit repair you can get the loan with minimal interest rate.|`|JJVqftnraa	It can really save you hassle to just get a car loan estimate on the web to verify what the going rates are.  You might be really suprised.  Also if your credit is not so great, a lot of online loaners are more willing to work with you.    What I always tell friends is that an online quote at http://auto.lowratetoday.com is the way to go.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Yes, but don't get scammed with a ridiculous interest rate. You will pay a higher rate so I wouldn't go overboard on a new car. I would get something reliable for a few thousand dollars. That way you can make your payments and pay it off quicker. You can improve your credit by making timely payments. You don't want to have a high interest rate on a $25,000 new car.     Plus in this sewer of an economy, a lower payment will put extra $$ in your wallet. I went from driving a $35,000 car to driving a 2000 Dodge Stratus, but it's paid off and it puts an extra $500/mth in my wallet.|`|1P3usILUaa	Depends upon the Dealer you are working with.

FdfE8iMEaa	Yes.  It works the same way as a credit card and may take a few days to show up at your bank instead of immediately like a debit card.|`|xnB0NVsbaa	As long as it has a visa or mastercard logo, which virtually all debit cards do now.|`|fGqkfLZQaa	Yes you sure can - the merchant processes it much the same it does a credit card.    Hope this helps|`|DbRhfYVSaa	Yes but that is not advisable because there are no protectins for fraud on a debit card. If someone steals your Credit Card   you can complain to your CC provider and usually not have to pay the charges. With a debit card, the criminal could empty your account and you would be fully responsible.|`|1P3usILUaa	Generally speaking its not advisable to use debit cards for purchasing online as it is a greater and longer process to have the transaction reversed by your bank.    Any card that has Master Card or Visa on it (regular credit cards or pre-paid credit cards) are better used for purchases on line for the backup we get from the card company.  They'll help you if the purchase goes poorly.    Another option is just setting up a PayPal account (which you can link to your bank account like your debit card) and if there are challenges with the purchase, PayPal is there to help you should the transaction not go well.  There is no extra cost for you this way and its a protected transaction similar to using Credit Cards.
KjWq21eJaa	My mother has been through this. File a notice for eviction with the local court. You may get an attorney, if you want to. The judge will set a hearing date. During the hearing the judge may give the tenant a date to vacate your premises. If they do not comply by that date you go back to the court. Then the judge issues the order for the sheriff to physically evict your tenants. The alternatives are: The court may wish to have the matter settled by mediation. You can sit down with the tenant and you may both decide on a mutually convenient date. Beware of "show cause" some courts allow the tenant to show cause as to why they are not able to vacate your property, potentially this can go on for months(depending on your jurisdiction) In the event that this occurs prepare your own "show cause" show the judge that deferring the evacuation date will result in undue financial hardships, or whatever reasons that you can find. I have been through this with my mother so many times and each case gets progressively nastier. TIP: please investigate whether you have the authority to have their utilities disconnected. Some states forbid this if the household has an infant, or if it is during winter. My mother was arrested by the police department because she withheld heat from her tennant who had been living rent and utility free for one year. Good luck you have a tough road ahead.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Call your local courthouse and sheriffs dept.  You have to get a court order and the sheriff will put them out.  Bad part it takes 3 months.  You and friends will have to set their crap on the curb.  You maybe able to confiscate it, sell it to off set the rent owed.  The sheriff will advise you.    Call the electric company and have it turned off.    If you rent again.  Screen your renters very carefully.  Even doing a credit check they pay for.  Otherwise no good renters will continue scamming you.  Have a written rental agreement.  Keep it professional and you will have less problems.|`|6292d9ef630e6d4aba7bd0e0e2d0d97daa	Never, ever accept a person check for a deposit or first months rent.  Always insist on guaranteed funds.  Believe it or not, there are people out there who search for landlords just like you and live for free until they are evicted.  They they find someone else just like you and start all over again.    Never, ever rely on a tenant to change the uilities. As long as it is in your name, you owe it, not them.  The day someone moves in, you call up the utility company and get the billing info changed to their name because the utility company can cut them off for non-payment, but you can't.  It's considered self-help eviction if you do it, and it will get you sued.    You need to follow the legal process for eviction based upon non-payment of rent in your state and then follow it. Your next step should be to file in court.|`|5mCm2XTLaa	Not sure about your state but in California once someone has been officially served and refuse to leave the next step is call in the local sheriff.     Turning off the power might sound like the proper thing to do but it'll get you into a lot of trouble because now your deadbeat tenants can accuse you of providing substandard housing.     There have been many cases where landlords turned off utilities in the hopes of getting non paying tenants to move only to find themselves in hot water with the housing authorities when they complained. Not only will you risk looking like the bad guy you can be cited and fined too.     Also resist the temptation to sneak in when they're gone and put their stuff out on the street. Might provide satisfaction but believe it or not I personally know someone who done just that and was sued for for damages. Let the authorities handle it, it's what they're paid to do.    You should have had the power turned off before they moved in thereby forcing them to have it turned on in their name. Shame you can't trust people anymore, always better to be safe than sorry.|`|D6WprqCIaa	If its in your name then call the eletric company and have your power shut off! It is your house to do as you please! I would contact the local police where the house is located and explain that you have evicted them and you want them out. Once they have got the eviction notice and the date with which you set for them to be out has passed they should be considered tresspassers!|`|b5b22241b72a751e94c18311e3dd0dddaa	A) never let them stay that long.  In my state, after 3 days, we start the eviction process.    B) you have no idea what your local laws are, you don't know what you're doing.  You're best bet right now is to get an eviction lawyer AND PAY ATTENTION so you can do it next time.|`|j74G3t51aa	You should check out the Landlord tenant rights for your state.  You could also consult a real estate attorney, I'm sure, they would know better.|`|xdiwDak3aa	Good info specific to Wisconsin is here:    http://www.legalexplorer.com/legal/legal...
AnptZGTtaa	Really depends on the Title Company what they charge. It can either be a  flat fee or a percentage of the sales price. I would say get in touch with  a closing agency for real estate transactions and they should be able to tell you roughly what they charge.   Also, there is a difference between a title search and title insurance. Title Insurance is to protect you against any flaws that could pop up on the title after the transaction has closed. It protects against things that could not have been found on the title when the search was done. Such as heirs from before titles were actually recorded, liens placed after the transfer  took place etc.    A title search makes sure that the chain of title does not show any liens that were not paid or encumbrances and encroachments affecting the property.   If the property is purchased with a mortgage loan there is normally not any way around a title search, the lender wants to make sure the title on the property is clear before they loan money on the property.

Since you haven't mentioned anything in regards to the size of your house, liability limits, dwelling coverage, or several other factors, you may want to find out from your current agent why you have what you have.  Then, you'll be able to make an educated decision on what you may be losing in coverage if you do in fact decide to switch companies.  Price is a factor, but should be one of the lowest priorities.  Coverage and claims satisfaction is paramount.

5KxklhJCaa	With the job market such as it is it will be difficult, the jobs that use to be in the realm of teens and retirees are now being taken by adults trying to support their families.   The hours a minor can work legally are limited and it is much easier to hire an adult.     Businesses such as Publix, Kroger's, Food Lion, Sonic, Chic-Fil-A, McDonald's, Winn-Dixie, Krystal's, Dairy Queen, and Burger King along with smaller local businesses that are in the same genre tend to hire those your age.     Fast-food and grocery stores are willing and able to train new employees but........................  Minors tend to have many issues that affect their ability to work such as tardiness, absenteeism, and numerous schedule requests, poor work-ethic etcetera.  I am NOT implying you will have those issues but the fact that many your age do makes it more difficult for you to get an opportunity to prove your worth.  Because of this you must be able to show through words and actions that you are reliable, dependable, punctual, detail oriented, trainable, coachable, punctual, mature and team oriented. You will also need great references since you don't have work experience. Talk to teachers, counselors, clergy, coaches, club sponsors, and directors of places you have volunteered or people you have done casual labor for and ask them about giving you a reference. Get accurate, current contact information for them and ask them to be ready to get calls for references from potential employers.    Remember:  Most businesses are individually owned and operated so it is the owners policy and past experience with minors that will determine if they will hire you. Apply everywhere you can, the worse that can happen is they don't hire you.    For information concerning work permit, hours you can work, jobs that you can do etcetera go to:  http://www.youthrules.dol.gov  US Department of Labor  YouthRules!     OR  You can do casual labor (working for an individual in their home) such as yard-work, house cleaning, pet sitting, baby-sitting, tutoring, running errands etcetera...|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|DfgHAPAwaa	kroger hires fourteen and up.|`|Z1FYjWmJaa	Paper delivery routes are a thought, as well as offering your services or yard work or babysitting to people in your neighborhood/town.

Go to your local estate sales and see if they have mailing lists ( many of mine do around here) and they have special preview sales for their mailing lists so you can get first dibs on anything cool they have before the general public. If you are a dealer or thinking of becoming one, a small ad in a local paper advertising that you buy vintage jewelry may yield results as well. And of course ebay is one of the best venues for anything like that. Good luck !

However look in box 2 of all W2's and that would be your refund if you do file. Form 1040EX pull it off the IRS website.    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provide. Click on my profile to read more.   Errol Quinn  Enrolled Agent   Master Tax Advisor|`|rY8NF65taa	I don't know about Wisconsin, but the Federal filing requirement for someone single and under age 65 is $8,950.  If this is your status, then technically you do not need to file.  However, even when you make below this amount, you will still want to file a return if taxes were withheld from your income so that you can get a refund for the taxes paid.  There are also some other credits that you may qualify for.  Check out the instructions for filling out the form 1040 on the IRS website if you're something other than what I described.  There is a section starting on page 7 that describes who needs to file and a table on page 8 where I got the income requirements.

6IOoS82Oaa	I did it say my ERD was processed and to expect by jan 30 but it may go in tomorrow crossing my fingers.They have received it and charged their fees now its up to my bank when to post it.
bfhsP4GFaa	So you applied today? Call on Friday.  If you call tomorrow morning, you'll seem desparate, and while you want to seem eager - desparate is not a good thing. Always ask to hand the application straight to whoever is in charge (make sure you know their name ahead of time). I worked at my local humane society, and they wouldn't even consider resumes when people came in and didn't ask for the managing director. Straight to the garbage.
RP6Xmvxsaa	in marketing you must make a volume of sales you better give some incentives cut your co mission  a little bit and im sure it will doubled your sales  its the same|`|n2YMGlxJaa	I'm not sure what kind of business you are doing here so it's kinda a vague answer, but you should defo set up some kind of an affiliate program...    People will earn a commission to advertise your product and get a % of every sale...
MsBoH20Iaa	this is a long shot , but check your loan and see if it included "gap " insurance. If it did you won't have to pay for what is left on the loan. Good luck.|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	If its value before the accident is the same as what you owe the bank, that is correct.  You had no equity so you get no money.  If you think the car is worth repairing you may be able to buy the remains of the car from the insurance company for a pittance.|`|vVCeUZDBaa	get it insured rght now........u ll be in profit.........|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Sure you can request another appraisal, you'll have to pay for it though. The insurer is not going to second guess their adjuster, so they're not going to send someone else from their office. You are currently upside down on your loan (the balance on the loan is more than the value of the car), therefore you would owe the difference unless you have gap insurance on your loan. Your credit situation is not the concern of you auto insurer.|`|1qI8Q48faa	Not sure what state you are in, However, the value of your automobile is the key factor in the determination of the ACV Actual Cash Value.  There are also other determaning factors such as prior damage. age, condition.  In most states if the vehicle damage approches 70% of the ACV the insurance company will deem the vehicle a total loss.  However you have the right to retain salvage.  If this is the case and you have a body shop who will work with you.  You can talk to your bank and have the car repaired with the money sent to your lein holder. If the body shop will not repair the vehicle for this price.  Then there is nothing you can do.  The key factors in this claim are,  if you have the vehicle repaired. and continue to drive it the body shop will be liable for the work performed for a minimum of one year.  The insurance co will drop your collision and Comprehensive insurance. Insurance companies will not cover a vehicle with a salvage title.    Another aspect of this claim would be  to go into appraisal.  This process is lengthy and the outcome is not normally in your favor.  Insurance companies spend a lot of money training there appraisers to national standards.  VIA I Car These are standard based in the auto repair industry to which a repair procedures are set.  You will have to hire a private appraiser.  and then the two appraisers meet before an arbitrator to settle the claim.  Once this process is completed there is not return and the claim is closed.      My advise to you would be talk to your adjuster.  Normally the adjuster and the appraiser are two different people.  The person who looked at your vehicle was most likely your appraiser and not the adjuster. Bring to the table with you any refurbishments you have performed on the vehicle.   new tires, recent receipts for additional parts, stereo equipment, engine rebuilds,  These will increase the value of the vehicle.    Good Luck and rember emotions get you no where with insurance companies.  Just the facts.
bfhsP4GFaa	Know your resume like the back of your hand, employers ask a lot of questions about past jobs, what you did, and what kind of qualifications you have.  Go over these in your head a few days before, while you're walking down the street or showering.  Wear business casual clothes that you feel comfortable in. Make sure you shower.. don't wear too much perfume/cologne (never know if your interviewee is allergic!) but make sure you smell nice.  Know some info about the company - research websites, get to know the product, etc.  Be polite! Show up early for the interview - Makes you seem eager and time organized. Be yourself/show your true personality.  Good luck :)    Take some deep breaths.
PjqZLX8Uaa	Miss May is right. We should all stop paying. Our monetary system is a scam anyway. The central bankers are the only ones who own any real wealth. Let's all stop paying them!!!|`|plOBKNy4aa	who cares, i think everyone should just stop paying bills, then we could all be worry free.
A3I4UJQyaa	I like SurveySavvy.com. It's free to sign up. You usually get paid anywhere from $1-10 per survey (depending on length). It's good because you can save up your earnings or cash out at anytime (no minimum to withdraw). The best part is that if you refer people through their site, you get paid when they complete surveys also!
x6wsmJQGaa	Did you report his income to SSI?  If not you could have an overpayment for the SSI Benefits.  Other than that.  yes he can claim you as a dependent if you lived together all year.  He can claim any of the children that lived with him for at least 6 months if they are his &  12 months if they are not.  Since I am assuming they all belong to the both of you, this should not be a problem, but he also has to provide for at least half of their living expenses for the year SSI aside.  SSI does not count for tax purposes.|`|fWc8Mki8aa	In order for your fiance to claim you as a dependent, you have to file a joint return which also requires you to be married so that won't work.    If your fiance provides more than half of the support for your son (support is defined by the IRS as housing, food, clothing, medical - very limited), then he should be able to claim your son.  However, it's often difficult to claim a child who receives SSI because the SSI usually pays for more than half the support (since the definition of support is so specific).|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	Does he provide more than 50% of the total income received by the family?  You should work through the 1040 booklet on dependents and head of household rules.  It is pretty straight forward if overly long.  If you can not figure it out you can go to one of the many volunteer organizations that provide help.  The IRS also provides help.  Do not fear asking the IRS as they will tell you how it works and will not punish you for asking how to make it better for your family.

Edwards Deming is considered one of the fathers of modern quality control, and was one of the most influential people in etablishing Japan's manufacturing prominence after World War II.  He is credited with being one of the first people to introduce the concepts of Statistical Process Control to manufacturing, including the use of control charts.  His theory was that improving product quality would lead to lower manufacturing costs, improved productivity and increased market share and revenues.    The Wikipedia link below says it all better than I can in a short time.|`|b8ef3b7487fb4f63dec03ac3a2bbd1acaa	The other thing is that he created the manufacturing marvel that is modern day Japan. Before he went over there Made in Japan was the kiss of death for a product. Now?
