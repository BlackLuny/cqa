20090308032734AAjgO4m	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I get my Associates first and transfer to a 4 year with all gen eds finished or go the whole 4 years?	If I go to the community college, first I'll need to get an apartment. This means money coming from somewhere...I don't know where...maybe financial aid (student loans)? I would be majoring in Computer Internetworking Technologies if all I wanted was the Associates degree because they don't require you to finish all your general education classes for that major...just a couple electives. If I got all my gen eds out of the way at this community college, I could transfer to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a 4-year university. Then I could major in probably Computer Engineering OR Computer Science and have absolutely no gen eds getting in the way. Then I could graduate with a Bachelors degree.      I'm told that UIUC makes freshman and sophomore year gen ed classes very difficult so that they weed out a lot of the people who don't give it their best effort or of course the people that just party all the time. I'll be 29 years old if I start at the university this year.      Benefits of 2 years at the community college:   1. Get all gen eds out of the way   2. Pay much less per credit hour than I would be paying for first two years at the university      Disadvantages of community college:   1. I would have to find somewhere nearby to live because I can't work and go to school at the same time (within walking distance or biking)   2. I would need money to pay for my living arrangements      Benefits of going all 4 years at the university:   1. Making long-lasting friendships   2. Many more clubs and activities to get involved with   3. I got partying all the time out of my system, so this would not be a problem   4. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has one of the best engineering departments of all the universities and colleges in the world      Disadvantages of going all 4 years to the university:   1. Extremely expensive costs for per credit hour   2. I would owe much much more 6 months after graduating to whatever bank I get the loans from or the federal government      You could say that it looks like I've answered my own question, but I haven't. I already finished 1 year at this same university back in 1998-1999, but had to leave because of medical problems. So I'm familiar with the school and I have a guaranteed re-entrance into the school without having to re-apply. Yeah, it HAS taken 10 years. I just need someone with an objective point-of-view. Thanks.

20090308033824AApExL5	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Any chance of getting into UNC-Chapel Hill?	Hi, I'm a junior in high school with a few questions.      First, the details. As of now I have a solid 4.0 GPA, am taking advanced classes, have taken 3 years of German, been in band since forever, am on my softball team (will be captain next year) and have done volunteer work for church. I live in North Dakota but I was kind of thinking of attending UNC because it'd be away from home but still close to my brother and sister, so I'd have some family. Both of them attended UNC - my sister currently, and my brother graduated from the business school. I'm sign up to take the ACT in April. Next year I am taking 5.5 credits out of the possible 8, but they include AP English, AP Calc, and AP Biology plus others.      Now, would it be extremely difficult for me to get in? And while I don't want to completely overload myself, would it be important to include Physics in my schedule for next year?  The tuition costs look a bit on the expensive side, too, so how much financial aid can I expect? I've also heard that one should take the SAT if they want to go to an east or west coast college, is this true?      Thanks for any help~ :3

20090308073548AAnxwY4	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	College search help please?	So.. it's college search time for me, and I need some help.      For private universities, I'm looking for a good engineering/physics/computer science place which is also pretty strong in liberal arts. I'd prefer that they give good merit scholarships and decent financial aid too. Examples are Harvey Mudd, Olin and Cooper Union (those all happen to be small, but I don't mind bigger places).      For publics, I want a university strong in the areas I mentioned above that also has a good honors program, preferably one that pays tuition, housing and then some. An example is UofI Urbana Champaign, I think?      I don't need only "top" universities that everyone knows about. I just need a starting point for research :D      Thanks!

Me and my friend were in our history class after school catching up on work when our english teacher walked in. Before this he had given out our marks for our english papers and i received joint highest result in the class. He said he was surprised by my mark because when he asks me questions in class i just say i don't no but when i comes to exams "wooff comes perfection". He said in like a jokingly manner and i was laughing as well. And then my history teacher said "you wouldn't believe it hes predicted an A* in history but in class it just seems like he daydreams" I laughed at this as well and took no offense to it.

We have to make a speech at high school and its about an event/aspect of your life.      1. I HATE speeches more that ANYTHING   2. I get so nervous and I cry almost every night before I have to do it   3. I don't want to tell anything about my life to the class or the teacher   4. We can't read it, cuz it has to be 'telling' not reading...      I have never ever done anything like this before, (at least not in English) I have only done like 2 presentations and that's it. And we can't even read it, but kinda 'make it up'.      I always go red and start shaking and my voice starts shaking and I don't think I can do this 2-3 minute speech. What to do? I mean I can't avoid speeches for all my life I know... But I'm SOOO nervous...
20090227142121AA3SeLY	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is $200,000 art college worth it?	I know of some people who've become successful artists without earning a bachelor's degree.         Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA accepted me, but it costs about $200,000 for four years. Ridiculous price. And now I'm thinking if someone is really does have talent they don't need to shell out that much and go into debt to become great. You can go to community college to become better. If you just wanna sell art in a gallery, buyers won't care much if you went to some great school.

One thing though, the hiring person had to get cut short because she got an important conference call. So I didn't spend as much time with her as the others. I believe the other interviews were positive, but I think she holds the cards.      The guy I would work directly for told me to think about some factors about the company because I will need to be comfortable with them. He implied I was going to have further contact with them and the process.      Does this sound promising and does it mean something when you meet 4 people in the first interview?

20090308052049AAUC6rE	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Please read! Need help in deciding a graduate degree?	I can not decide on what degree to go after. When I am looking for a degree to obtain I am looking for what jobs that degree will open up for me. Here are some facts; I will be obtaining my BSBA (bachelors of Science in Business Administration) with a minor in human recourses from DeVry University in two weeks. I want to immediately go and attain a graduate degree because I know that I will not be motivated to go back to school later on in my life and a DeVry degree is worthless. The school that I want to attend is CSU (California State University) Sacramento because I don‚Äôt want to spend 5 times more money on a private school. Here is a link of all the graduate degrees that they offer.        http://aaweb.csus.edu/catalog/current/Fi...       My strengths are that I am a:   ? Outstanding leader   ? Strong problem solver   ? Effective public speaker   ? Good mathematical skills   ? Excellent understanding of concepts   ? Superb reasoning skills      My weaknesses are that I:   ? Have problems writing constantly   ? Do not have the most extensive vocabulary   ? Hate remembering useless information that will not benefit me   ? Do not like to be doing the same thing over and over again   ? Like to use my brain      What I think are good carrier characteristics are:   ? A salary of around 75k to 100k    ? To rarely work more than 40 hours a week   ? A job that should be around for 40 years   ? The job to be is somewhat of demand   ? That maybe requires a license      What I think are bad carrier characteristics are:   ? A job that will not get affected much by outsourcing or of shoring   ? The ability to get the job without a degree in that field   ? The lack of critical thinking involved that the employee is more like a tool than a person   ? An inconsistent salary (like contractors)      I know that I am not going to find a perfect job that fits me to the T but I would like to at least like to get one that comes close. I have thought about getting a MBA (Masters of Business Administration) but I am not sure I want to do it because I am kind of scared of the business world, the MBA is not necessary to become a manager, and it is kind of getting devalued. Please correct me if I am wrong. So what degree do you think I should apply for?

20090308053735AApIAN3	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	I need a lawyer  against my charter high schoool. here's the case!?	I attend school at Granada Hills Charter High school for the past 3, almost 4 years and I am graduating this year.  After almost 1 year  of not having any discipline problems and focusing to keep my grades up and taking college classes while working, Granada seems to have found some sort of fault, to suspend me. I am no straight A student and defiantly not someone to make problems for no reason. But in this case, Granada Hills Charter High school has taken their authority to the next level and has suspended me for no real fault.  Let me start by telling you of the situation that had occurred. On March 4, 2009, I came to school in no intentions to stay, I had a written note signed by my mother saying that my purpose was to come to school and give me teachers my homework assignments and leave to the hospital. I came to school, I believe at 8:30 am, after school had started which was 8:10. I showed the security guard in the front office who had allowed me to come into school to do what I had to do ( if there was a problem - he would have said something), which was to drop off my homework assignments . I then proceeded to the library to print my homework assignments. I did not have a pass by a teacher to be in there, but I was never in class to begin with. I showed the librarian the note that my mother signed to and the librarian did not want to believe it and stated, '' Your putting me in a tight spot, but you've got 5 minutes.'' Allowing me to print, but then I said, '' It's okay, I'll just go.'' and walked out, because she obviously did not understand my purpose. As I walking out, she told me to go to ''A5,'' which is a place where kids go when they are late . But she obviously said that, because she did understand my purpose was to simply drop off my homework assignments and leave. Then I went into my English teacher's class who saw the note and allowed me  to print up my economics homework, English homework, and my college class homework, Sociology and dropped it off to my teachers and left just as it was instructed in my mother's note. The following day, I was called up to Mrs.Hutton's office, accused of being defiant and that I was told to go to the attendance office that day and that I did go there and they said I couldn't leave and I just left. That was clearly a lie and impossible because I was never in the attendance office nor did they tell me I was not allowed to leave.  So we went into the attendance office where I asked the question, ''Did you ever actually see my face in the attendance office and told me that I was not allowed to leave?'' She simply answered,  ''No, the only thing I got was a phone call from the librarian.''  Then, Mrs.Hutton continued to suspend me for being defiant. Which clearly comes across the question, defiant to whom? In this case, (if i was defiant it would have been defiant to the librarian because I did not stay the 5 minutes that she allowed me to - that would have put her into a tight spot? ) I was not defiant to anyone , because I came into the school from the only way in and left school from the only way out - the front ;without being hassled or hesitant about letting me out by the security guard who was there. Mrs. Hutton then wrote in the suspension letter that I was being suspended for ''being told to go to the attendance office and was told not to leave but then she still left.'' Which is clearly impossible, to leave that school without  securities hassling you. But in fact, we had already cleared up that up. I got back into class where I had noticed that error in the suspension letter, I got a  pass and went back to see her, where then she said, '' I had it already fixed in the computer, and the one I was sending to your house states otherwise.'' When she did take the one that she was going to send to my house out - to shred, I checked it and it stated the same false information, where then I pointed out that she clearly said that it was fixed in the computer and  the one  that my mother was going to get through the mail had been fixed. Which she clearly lied again.  The one with error , I told her that I wanted to keep that was already in my hands, because I wanted my mother to know what I was actually being suspended for.  She, then got loud, and said '' I'm only giving you one either that one or this one !''  which left me no other choice to give it to her, where then she ripped apart in front of my eyes. Then that day, my mother and I came to talk to Mr.Bauer  but he was not in and we got sent to the deans office, where they found it amusing and did not acknowledge that my mother was there until 30 minutes later when Mrs.Hutton then came back to say that there was no translators (STUDENT TRANSLATOR THAT IS.) And said rudely, '' Why did you bring your mother in today, today isn't the meeting - come back on the meeting day.'' As we were walking out, we heard laughter inside the deans office  and basically was taken as a joke. My mother even had my sister tra

I remember going to public school in England (1946 to 1952) and the headmaster would have everyone in the hall in the morning for a hyme, a prayer and a little talk.  This started the day on a good note and I think it has to do with moral and ethics in society.  In the US today the public schools are not allowed to even mention religion and I think it is a major contributing factor to our moral decay.  I am not an overly relegious person but I do think it is generally a good guideline for "doing the right thing."

20090308062807AAUCLmy	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	HNC for US Transfer Credit, has anyone else done this? Must Read to see the pitiful credit I was given...?	OK I followed the information on the Fulbright Commission which states that an HNC is worth at least 1 year of Higher Education in the US, and an HND should receive at least 1.5 years, and can give entry to an MBA, which can be found here:    http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/caree...       However cold reality was that one of the 'credential evaluation services' considered a completed HNC/HND to be worth only 8 credits. Worse than that because an HNC was awarded at grade C or gpa of 2.      I hold four HNC's/HND's which according to those people, I had only US college 32 credits. To add insult to injury, according to the foreign credential evaluation nonsense that was equivalent to three at grade C and one at grade B. This is of course completely wrong and very very grudging.      Now bearing in mind that in the US, I have chalked up a few CLEP's. and Dantes and found them too easy for words and hold as much credit doing those things in a few short weeks. There is something arrogant and grudging about the credential evaluation service. For my HND gained at a British University I was awarded only 8 credits.      I may try another foreign credential evaluation service. Interested to know what anyone else has received in way of credit and what foreign credential service you used.

20090308085558AAxPLpD	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What does it mean to "Take yourself too seriously?	I met this girl at a party and we hit it off.  We studied together at the library and at my house about a week later.  A few days ago I went to her place to study with her and after about an hour of being there I went out to my car to get something, and realized that it was gone!  Apparently, you can't park in certain spots at this apartment complex or they tow you (there were no signs to specify).  So, at 1230 at night I was pretty pissed that she mentioned nothing about how nazi they are about towing cars at that place. Not to mention it cost $120 to get my car back.  Last night, after she got home from the bars she was texting me and ended up telling me that I'm uptight, and that I "take myself too seriously".        What the hell does that mean?  I don't enjoy pissing away money like that.  This girl and I have hung out only a handful of times, and while studying--hardly enough time to judge someones character so harshly.  And I'm a pre-med student, so I study and take school seriously.        Can somebody explain this vagina logic to me?

There is this man that I really have feelings for and he is aware of this.  We've never dated, mainly because of him. We do work in the same industry and recently I went on a job interview and the guy interviewing me; said that the guy that I like thinks I can walk on water. Now mind you, the gentleman interviewing me does not know I have feeling for the other one. I know this doesn't have anything to do with my feelings for him or our friendship, but what exactly does that mean?

20090308084927AAxTPGC	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Language options at university?	I'm at the point now where I need to seriously think about what course I'm doing at university. I definately want to do languages and I'm planning on doing a joint honours (French + another language).   I'm unsure of what other language to pick though. I fancy doing Hungarian (my grandad is Hungarian and it's something really unusual as well) but at the same time I don't know whether it would be of much use. German, Spanish and Italian are really popular so I don't want to do them.    So my question is, what language would be the best? Eastern European? Arabic? Japanese? I want to do something that stands out, but at the same time would be relevant. I don't want to do something for 4yrs and then find I can't get a job because they don't need it.      Thanks

20090308085223AA4J0B9	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Hi...how should i end my stroy due tomoorow and how can i correct it?	Untitled    There are three of us in the family, if you didn‚Äôt count Harry, the family dog.  Our last names were Goldberg. We are Jews.  Although we weren‚Äôt religious, Ma took our custom seriously and celebrated every holiday.  We all took pride in it.  My little sister Sarah will be starting middle school this September.  I became the man of the house, after my father died, since; I took a low paid job at the local bakery as the chief‚Äôs assistance.  I made 25 zloty per day.            Even if life was hard we kept on living.  On September 1st, 1939 was a day I will never forget, I don‚Äôt think anyone will.  I recall sharply my mother‚Äôs raspy voice trying to wake my sister up and finishing up my breakfast before I left for work.  At around noon, we were attacked by Germans.  Fighter planes rocketed back and forth and within minutes, we seemed to have lost already.  In panic, I ran home, still wearing an apron. Relief that my village was still untouched, we stated packing.  We gave Harry to a neighbor, figuring he slow us down.          Awhile later, we were confronted by German soldiers.  I stared me right into the eye.  They took Sarah from my mother‚Äôs hand and drag her to a truck with other children.  I got very angry and punched one of the soldiers so hard, my knuckles became displaced.  The soldier stared back at me with the eyes of a tiger.    Ma tugged my sleeve, signaling me to run.  We ran as fast as we could, but mother couldn‚Äôt keep up.  A group of soldiers opened fire, mother freeze.  The Germans cuffed her, and drag her to another truck.  They went straight to the gas.
