CUTDy6ssaa	Si ...escuche de algo así ..mi hijo de 8 a?os ...se siente bajo de animo cuando vamos al mall....el doctor dijo que era una especie de depresion por el ruido ( asi como murmullo ) que hay donde hay grandes grupos de personas.....<br>  <br>  Editando :<br>  Infrasonidos (sonidos de baja frecuencia) aliado del stress? <br>  <br>  Los infrasonidos o sonidos de baja frecuencia, no son captados por nuestro oido, pero si lo son por nuestras retinas que vibran haciendo que en la vista periferica, veamos sombras nebulosas y confundiendo a nuestro cerebro.<br>  <br>  Estos sonidos de baja frecuencia puden ser producidos en su mayoria por aparatos de aire acondicionado, ventiladores de techo (especialmente), pero tambien por ventiladores varios como los de las computadores entre otros, digamos que son los que funcionan por largo tiempo en nuestro hogar y trabajo, creando asi la frecuencia estable necesaria, para formar vibraciones, sobre todo en nuestras retinas, enga?ando al cerebro que nos forma imagenes erroneas de nuestro entorno y confunde la vision, ya que la retina memoriza (retiene) la imagen anterior para que la transicion de un angulo a otro no sea de forma brusca.<br>  <br>  Esto si estamos bajo un estado de stress alto, pude funcionar como detonante generando miedo ya que el cerebro en un estado de alteracion constante, camufla todos los sintomas que antes eran irrelevantes convirtiendolos ahora en una amenaza para nuestra salud mental, asi funciona con otros sintomas antes (triviales) ahora importantes segun nuestro cerebro bajo presion.<br>  <br>  Lady ..te dejo este estudio que encontre ...ahi habla de como medir los sonidos ...esta interesante <br>  <a href="http://www.frlp.utn.edu.ar/lemac/Publicaciones/Del%202002/Ruido%20-%20CPA.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.frlp.utn.edu.ar/lemac/Publica...</a>|`|5JxqQvHWaa	Desconozco el tema pero me interesa.|`|FUno57Qjaa	Pueda que te sirva esta poca información que logré conseguirte:<br>  <br>  "BIOACUSTICA, EL ESTUDIO DEL SONIDO VIVO<br>  <br>  La Bioacústica es la rama de la ciencia que se dedica al estudio de la producción de sonido y sus efectos en los seres vivos. En particular, comunicación animal, trata el estudio de la producción, significados y efectos que causan los sonidos generados por animales.<br>  <br>  Hay muchas especializaciones en comunicación animal y bioacústica, la más popular y conocida por el publico en general es el estudio del canto de los pájaros. Si estas interesado en el sonido producido por los pájaros, ves a LINKS.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Hay diferentes formas de analizar el sonido, sin embargo cada vocalización tanto si viene del hombre como de los elefantes, siempre viene expresada en frecuencia y amplitud<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  FRECUENCIA<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La frecuencia de un sonido o vocalización es el diapasón. En otras palabras, la voz de un bebe humano será mas alta que la del adulto humano. Niveles de frecuencia, se expresan en Hertz (Hz).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  A:) SONIDO INFRASONICO<br>  <br>  El sonido infrasónico es el sonido que esta por debajo de la capacidad auditiva del hombre, técnicamente 20Hz, aunque la gran mayoría de adultos será difícil que escuchen por debajo de 40Hz.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo cuando el sonido infrasónico, tiene una amplitud lo suficientemente grande, lo podremos notar, ya que sentiríamos como si nos agitasen. Si alguna vez alguien ha visto el despegue de una nave espacial, te dirá que toda la tierra vibra, eso es sonido infrasónico!!!.<br>  <br>  El sonido infrasónico es una onda de sonido muy larga, esta onda puede pasar a través de bosques, edificios e incluso monta?as. Por ejemplo si nos quedamos con el ejemplo del despegue de una nave espacial, estas crean al despegar una onda de sonido muy, muy baja de aproximadamente 0.02Hz, y tarda alrededor de 20 minutos en llegar desde Kennedy, Florida hasta la base aérea de Longley, Virginia. Pues bien, esta se?al ira viajando alrededor de la tierra hasta que se disipa debido a la atenuación. Animales que producen este tipo de sonido incluyen: elefantes, ballenas, caimanes, hipopótamos, rinocerontes, jirafas, leones, okapi, y diferentes pájaros. Había un pensamiento común, y era que se creía que tan solo los animales de grandes dimensiones producían sonido infrasónico, aunque se ha demostrado que también los de peque?as dimensiones producen este sonido y probablemente hay muchos que no lo sabemos todavía. Fauna Communications se especializa en el estudio de este tipo de sonido, el sonido infrasónico.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  B: ) SONIDO SONICO<br>  <br>  Este tipo de sonido esta dentro de la capacidad auditiva del hombre, técnicamente de 20 a 20,000Hz. Muy probablemente para las personas adultas sería de 40 a 15,000 Hz. Muchos animales se comunican entre estos valores sonicos, entre ellos la gran mayoria de mamíferos, pajaros, peces etc…<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  C: ) ULTRASONIDO<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  El ultrasonido es el sonido que ocurre por encima de la capacidad auditiva del hombre, o por encima de 20,000Hz. Animales que se comunican con sonido ultrasónico, incluyen a los DELFINES, murciélagos, muchos pájaros e insectos.<br>  <br>  Las ondas ultrasónicas son ondas cortas que rebotan en árboles, rocas etc… Es por esto que los murciélagos y delfines usan este tipo de se?ales para la eco-colocación. Este es un campo muy interesante de la bioacústica, y en la cual Fauna Communications esta muy interesada.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  AMPLITUD<br>  <br>  La amplitud de un sonido o vocalización es el volumen, es decir, el susurro de una persona humana sera más baja en amplitud que la amplitud que tenga una conversación normal. Amplitud es expresada en decibelios (dB).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En una conversacion entre personas la amplitud varia entre 40 y 70dB. Un elefante produce un sonido de 14 Hz ( infrasonico ), o sea no lo podemos oir, pero lo podemos sentir en modo de vibración porque su amplitud es de 90dB. Una jirafa produce un sonido infrasónico de 14Hz. Aunque ésta ni la podemos oir ni sentir, ya que su amplitud es de 40dB.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hay muchísimo mas sobre comunicación animal, que como comprenderéis no vamos a tratar aquí por lo extenso que es. Para mas informacion puedes ver la pagina de LINKS"<br>  <br>  Suerte, que la disfrutes esta tu información. ?Y feliz a?o 2008!|`|j0Jyurf7aa	Lady, no soy un experto en el tema, ni mucho menos. Sin embargo me gustaría compartir un par de experiencias al respecto.<br>  <br>  Como todos sabemos, los perros tienen una capacidad auditiva muy superior a la nuestra. Esto se ve además aumentado en los casos en que por cuestiones cosméticas a algunas razas se les amputa parte del pabellón auricular, (los doberman, por ejemplo), con lo que el animal pierde parte de sus "defensas" contra el ruido ambiente.<br>  <br>  Hace algún tiempo atrás en una planta transformadora de energía eléctrica de UTE, la empresa estatal de mi país,  se adoptó la idea de incorporar perros al servicio de vigilancia del predio.<br>  <br>  La idea duró muy poco, ya que los animales se volvían díscolos y agrtesivos sin causa aparente, hasta que las debidas consulta veterinarias determinaron que los animales se sentían molestos por el sonido de baja frecuencia generado por los transformadores, el cual es casi <br>  inaudible para los humanos.<br>  <br>  Asimismo, hace algún tiempo tuve la oportunidad de recorrer una enorme nave de guerra de un país amigo que visitó nuestro Puerto, y al llegar a la sala de máquinas se me hizo colocar un casco con auriculares y un sistema de radio transmisión. Eso me llamó la atención, debido a que no había ruidos fuertes, y se me explicó que era para proteger al tímpano de las bajas frecuencias, generadas por los campos de los motores.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a si se puede medir o no, no puedo abrir juicio certero, pero imagino que así como existen multímetros calibrados para medir la energía reactiva a nivel de corriente eléctrica también deben de existir decibelímetros que puedan cumplir esa función.<br>  <br>  Saludos !!!|`|gRh9mSppaa	Hola Lady, habia escuchado del tema.

f17cd1f349a8e597dc0c2bfe9bead019aa	Il problema del territorio olandese è sempre stato rappresentato dal fatto che l'altezza media sul livello del mare è minima. Anche oggi è così. Gli olandesi per difendersi dalle inondazioni hanno costruito un sistema di dighe (dam) che ha permesso di mantenere il livello dell'acqua nel terreno ad un livello accettabile e ad impedire appunto le inondazioni. L'abitudine di costruire le case sopra ai terpen nasce da qui ed è stata un scelta obbligata, infatti non si possono costruire le fondamenta di un edificio in un terreno intriso d'acqua e quindi paludoso e poco consistente. Spero di esserti stato utile. Ciao...|`|EBukuoubaa	Una collina artificiale dimora (noto come Terp, Wierde, Warf, Warft, Werf e Wurt) è un tumulo artificiale, poggio o poggio, che è stato creato da esseri umani di avere un riparo asciutto durante l'alta marea e inondazioni. Queste colline si verificano nella parte settentrionale dei Paesi Bassi (in olandese province di Frisia, e Groninga), e Germania, dove, prima di dighe sono state effettuate, le maree interferito con la vita quotidiana. <br>  <br>  <br>  [Modifica] Terpen in Friesland <br>  Nella provincia olandese della Frisia uno artificiale dimora collina è noto come terp (terpene plurale). Terp significa "villaggio" in Old Frisone ed è cognate thorp con l'inglese, danese torp, tedesco e olandese Dorf dorp. La parola migliore per queste montagne sarebbe quindi wierde o Wurt, ma terp è diventato il termine predominante. Frisone insediamenti storici sono stati terpene artificiale costruito su misura fino a 15 m di altezza per essere al sicuro da inondazioni in periodi di innalzamento del livello del mare. Il primo periodo terp-edificio risale al 500 aC, il secondo da 200 aC al 50 aC. Nella metà 3 ° secolo, l'aumento del livello del mare era talmente drammatica che il quartiere è stato abbandonato argilla, e coloni restituito solo intorno al 400 dC. Un terzo periodo terp-edificio risale al 700 dC (Old Frisone volte). Questo è concluso con la venuta della diga attorno al 1200. Durante il 18 ° e 19 ° secolo sono state distrutte molte terps di utilizzare il terreno fertile essi contenute fattoria per fertilizzare i campi (come la tendenza a terpene sono stati ben fecondato dal decadimento dei rifiuti e personali dei rifiuti depositati dai loro abitanti dei secoli). Il più grande terp, visto sulla foto a destra, è ancora conservata. <br>  <br>  <br>  [Modifica] Wierden in provincia di Groninga <br>  Nella provincia olandese di Groningen dimora collina artificiale è denominato wierde (wierden plurale). LIke in Frisia, il primo edificio si è verificato wierde-500 aC o forse prima. <br>  <br>  <br>  [Modifica] Elenco delle montagne artificiali dimora <br>  Toponimi nella regione costiera Frisone terminano in-werd,-reparto, ecc-uert fanno riferimento al fatto che il villaggio è stato costruito su una collina artificiale dimora (wierde). La maggior parte dei villaggi terp-anche se hanno nomi che terminano in-um, da heem-o-hiem, significato (fattoria) cantiere, motivi. Ci sono un paio di villagenames in Friesland termina con-terp (ad esempio Ureterp), che si riferisce non a un tumulo dimora, ma solo per l'Antico Frisone parola per villaggio. Il primo elemento di toponimi è molto spesso un nome di persona o è semplicemente descrivendo le caratteristiche ambientali della soluzione (ad esempio Rasquert (prov. Groningen) Riazuur?: wierde con canna, giunco, dove cresce). <br>  Alcuni sono noti terpene 1200 a Groningen Friesland e solo, abbandonato da diversi insediamenti, montagne con un solo poche ore case coloniche, fino al più grande dei villaggi e città vecchia. Alcuni di essi sono elencati qui di seguito.|`|vmHF0153aa	perchè  nella maggior parte delle zone, in olanda , il terreno è sotto il livello del mare, per cui le fattorie le costruivano il più in alto possibile , per riparale delle piene del mare. <br>  Comunque hanno costruito delle dighe per difendere i territori dalla furia ( e dalla corrosione)del mare.|`|8Cql57fHaa	Per evitare inondazioni!|`|Q2vKOR3waa	Le costruivano nella parte alta per evitare le eventuali inondazioni.

La carencia de este elemento en muchas culturas es un problema de desnitricion en la poblacion infantil por la escases de este recurso alimenticio,El reemplazar esta fuente de proteinas y calcio resulta dificil y muy costoso para la poblacion de escasos recursos economicos.<br>  Depronto pensaria que más facil es establecer unos medios menos estresantes para estos hermosos animales,en el caso de los mataderos, pues se podria argumentar entonces lo mismo con otros productos por ejemplo la carne de cerdo.El escuchar los gritos aterradores de los marranos en el sacrificio harian pensar a muchos que es mejor no comer cerdo.Otro ejemplo es ala se?ora que toma a la gallina por el pescueso y lo retuerse hasta partirlo, en fin son mucjhos los ejemplos de animales domesticos que aparentemente sufren en el momentos de ser sacrificados.Y ese dolor nuestro esta muy bien pero creo que seria importante que asi como vemos el problema pensemos en plantear soluciones sanas y prácticas.<br>  <br>  Te dejon este articulo un poco largo como tu ponencia pero igual interesante sobre la leche.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  La leche es un líquido nutritivo de color blanquecino producido por las hembras de los mamíferos (incluidos los monotremas).Esta capacidad de las hembras es una de las características que definen a los mamíferos. La principal función de la leche es la de alimentar a los hijos hasta que sean capaces de digerir otros alimentos: es el único alimento de las crías de los mamíferos (del ni?o de pecho en el caso de los seres humanos) hasta el destete.La leche de los mamíferos domésticos es un aliménto básico corriente en la inmensa mayoría de las civilizaciones humanas: de vaca, principalmente, pero también de oveja, cabra, de yegua, de camella, de dromedaria, etc.<br>  <br>  La leche es la base de numerosos productos, como la mantequilla, el queso o el yogur. Son muy frecuentes los empleos de los derivados de la leche que son utilizados en las industrias agroalimentarias, químicas y farmacéuticas: leche condensada, leche en polvo, caseína o lactosa.La leche de vaca se utiliza también en la alimentación animal. Está compuesta principalmente por agua, materia grasa, proteínas, hidratos de carbono (lactosa), calcio, minerales y sal.<br>  <br>  Llamamos también leche el jugo de ciertas plantas o frutos: leche de coco, leche de soja, leche de arroz, o leche de almendra. Sin embargo, para la definición científica, el término leche no aplica a los jugos de nueces. La leche de los mamíferos marinos, o las ballenas, es mucho más rica en grasas y nutrientes que la de los mamíferos terrestres.<br>  <br>  El líquido es producido por las células secretoras de las glándulas mamarias o mamas (llamadas "pechos" en el caso de la mujer y "ubres" en los mamíferos domésticos). La secreción láctea de una hembra días antes y después del parto se llama calostro.<br>  <br>   <br>  La leche es actualmente uno de los productos agrícolas más importantes. El cuadro La lechera, de Vermeer, encierra elementos simbólicos, entre los cuales, el más importante es la blancura de la leche, que alude a pureza y virtud de la joven, demostrando un poco el valor cultural de la leche.<br>  <br>   Historia <br>  El mamífero Eomaia fue un ancestro común de los mamíferos y se cree que contaba con la capacidad de producir leche como los mamíferos en la actualidad.La leche es, en un contexto biológico, una adaptación evolutiva de los mamíferos. Aunque no ha sido posible aún determinar el tiempo exacto de la aparición de esta adaptación, se fija en 300 millones de a?os[9] y se plantea la posibilidad de que fueran primero los monotremas los que desarrollaron esta capacidad. Estos animales secretaban la leche para alimentar a sus crías después de salir del huevo, como algunas especies hacen todavía hoy, como por ejemplo el ornitorrinco y la equidna. Posteriormente, los marsupiales, primos más cercanos de los mamíferos placentarios, produjeron leche de las mamas ubicadas en su bolsa, denominada marsupia.<br>  <br>   <br>  La necesidad evolutiva de alimentar a las crías se ve satisfecha en la producción de leche propia de los mamíferos.El antecesor inmediato de los mamíferos actuales es conocido como Eomaia, un peque?o animal que superficialmente se asemejaba con los roedores actuales, que vivió hace 125 millones de a?os durante el periodo Cretácico. Es casi seguro que este animal produjera leche como los mamíferos placentarios actuales. El consumo de la leche de origen animal comenzó con la domesticación de los animales en Oriente Medio: primero las vacas, luego las cabras y finalmente las ovejas, entre el 9000 y 8000 a.C.<br>  <br>  La leche ha capturado la imaginación de muchas culturas, y de esta forma la leche y sus derivados, como la mantequilla, aparecen en los mitos de las tribus que van desde la India hasta Escandinavia; y en el Antiguo Testamento aparecen como símbolos de abundancia y creación. Era tomada como un ofrecimiento a los dioses [10] y por lo tanto era tenida como un acto divino relacionado con la vida. En la actualidad esta bebida ha perdido su magia y ha generado polémica en cuanto a sus propiedades nutricionales debido a su alto contenido en grasa. Los numerosos productos derivados de la leche se categorizan en una amplia categoría denominada lácteos.<br>  <br>  En la edad media, antes de revolución industrial la leche era muy difícil de conservar y es por esta razón por la que se consumía fresca o procesada en forma de quesos. Durante los a?os se fueron a?adiendo diferentes productos lácteos como la mantequilla. La revolución industrial en Europa, alrededor de 1830, trajo la posibilidad de transportar la leche fresca de las zonas rurales a las grandes ciudades gracias las mejoras en los transportes. No obstante fueron apareciendo nuevos instrumentos en la industria de procesado de la leche: uno de los más conocidos es la pasteurización sugerida para la leche por primera vez a el químico agrícola alemán Franz von Soxhlet en el a?o 1886. Estas innovaciones hicieron que la leche tuviera unos tiempos de conserva más predecibles, a parte de una mayor higiene en su procesado y un aspecto más saludable.<br>  <br>  Algunos ejemplos de glándulas mamarias<br>  <br>  Vaca<br>  <br>   <br>  Cerdo<br>  <br>   <br>  Oveja<br>  <br>   <br>  Elefante<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   Definición y obtención <br>  Estructura de una glándula mamaria durante la lactancia: 1-Grasa, 2-Lóbulo del ducto lactífero, 3-Lóbulo, 4-Tejido conectivo, 5-Seno del ducto lactífero, 6-Ducto lactífero.Se puede definir la leche de varias maneras, pero por cuestiones de practicidad se suele caracterizar en tres rubros:<br>  <br>  Biológica: Es una sustancia segregada por la hembra de los mamíferos con la finalidad de nutrir a las crías. <br>  Legal: Producto del orde?o de un hato sano y que no representa un peligro para el consumo humano. <br>  Técnica o fisicoquímica: Sistema en equilibrio constituido por tres sistemas dispersos: solución, emulsión y suspensión. <br>  Actualmente la leche que se utiliza en producción de derivados lácteos es la de vaca, debido a las propiedades que posee. Pero no es la única especie cuya leche es explotada, ya que de acuerdo a la región y al tipo de animales que haya, es la leche que se emplea. La leche de cabra es ideal para elaborar cajeta, y en las regiones árticas se emplea la leche de ballena. La leche de asna y de yegua son las que contienen menos materia grasa, mientras que la de foca contiene más de un 50% de aquella.<br>  <br>   <br>  La leche de vaca de la raza Holstein es la que se emplea con mayor frecuencia en las granjas lecheras.La leche de origen humano no es producida ni distribuida a escala industrial. Existen sin embargo unos bancos de leche que recogen las donaciones de leche materna y la distribuyen para los ni?os que lo necesitan (ya sean prematuros o alérgicos). A nivel mundial podemos distinguir varias especies de animales de las que se puede obtener leche. Así se obtiene leche también de:<br>  <br>  La oveja; <br>  la cabra; <br>  la yegua; <br>  la burra; <br>  la camella (y otras camélidas, como la llama o la alpaca); <br>  la yaka; <br>  la búfala; <br>  la rena y <br>  la alcesa. <br>  La leche proveniente de la vaca (Bos taurus) es la que posee mayor importancia en la dieta y mayor cantidad de aplicaciones industriales<br>  <br>  <br>   La vaca: Europea e India  <br>  La raza bovina que se propagó hace más de 10.000 a?os en el continente euroasiático fue el ancestro del actual Bos taurus y se denominaba Bos primigenius, que dio lugar tras su domesticación a la mayor parte del ganado vacuno actual. Se trataba de un bovino de amplios cuernos que fue domesticado en Oriente Medio, se expandió por parte de áfrica, y dio lugar a la famosa raza cebú de Asia central. El cebú es valorado por su aporte cárnico y por su leche; la variante europea del Bos primigenius tiene los cuernos más cortos y ha sido adaptada con el tiempo para que sea posible cuidarla como ganadería en los establos: es la que ha acabado siendo un conjunto de razas lecheras tales como la Holstein, Guernsey, Jersey, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>   El búfalo  <br>  El denominado búfalo de agua (Bubalus bubalis) domesticado en 3000 a.C. en Mesopotamia es poco conocido en Occidente como fuente de leche; por el contrario, es mucho más conocido en las poblaciones que habitan Asia. Este animal es muy sensible al calor y su nombre denota la costumbre que posee para refrigerarse (se sumerge en agua). Los árabes trajeron este animal al Oriente Medio en la Edad Media (700 a.C.). Su empleo en ciertas zonas de Europa data de aquella época como en la elaboración de la famosa mozzarella di bufala italiana. Los productos elaborados con leche de búfala empiezan a sustituir en algunas comunidades a los de leche de vaca.<br>  <br>  <br>   El yak <br>  El yak (denominado como Bos grunniens) es un bovino de largo pelo que forma parte fundamental de la alimentación de las poblaciones del Tíbet y de Asia central. Posee una leche rica en proteínas y en grasas (su concentración es superior a su equivalente vacuno), los tibetanos elaboran mantequillas y diferentes productos lácteos fermentados con la leche procedente de este animal, una de las más conocidas es el té con mantequilla salado.<br>  <br>  <br>   La cabra y la oveja <br>  El dios mitológico Zeus orde?ando la cabra amaltea.La cabra y la oveja pertenecen a la rama de los rumiantes denominada ovicápridos. La oveja (Ovis aries) fue el primer animal tras el perro en ser domesticado por el ser humano y su periodo sería entre el 8000 a.C. y el 9000 a.C.. La cabra (Capra hircus) posiblemente fuera domesticada en aquella misma época. La cabra posee una leche con un sabor y aroma fuertes. La leche de oveja es más rica en contenido graso que la leche de búfalo e incluso es más rica en contenido proteínico, se trata de una leche muy valorada en las culturas mediterráneas.<br>  <br>  <br>   El camello <br>  El camello es un animal lejano a los bóvidos y los ovicápridos, pero su leche es muy apreciada en los climas áridos donde fue domesticado en 2500 a.C. en Asia Central; su leche es muy apreciada en algunas culturas de noroeste de áfrica.|`|TMyN2Cx7aa	Hola<br>  <br>  Primero: Tu pregunta no es una pregunta es un panfleto.<br>  <br>  Segundo: 1 litro de leche tiene nutrientes, unos 30-35 g de proteínas, 25-30 gramos de lípidos y otro tanto de carbohidratos, además de minerales y vitaminas.<br>  <br>  No puedes decir que la leche no aporta nutrientes.

La elaboración de ciertos lácteos como el queso se asocia en la cultura popular a un alimento que tradicionalmente asignado a las costumbres culinarias de los pastores de ganado. El origen de su uso se pierde en el pasado, siendo poco posible determinar la primera vez que se emplearon, algunos autores mencionan que pueden haberse originado en la fermentación de la leche que se almacenaba en las vasijas elaboradas con los estómagos de animales.[2] Los productos lácteos y la leche se han desarrolado históricamente en los pueblos que poseen mejor capacidad de digestión, cabe pensar que algunas culturas poseen poca secreción de la lactasa (un enzima capaz de ayudar al organismo a la digestión del principal azúcar de la leche: la lactosa) y por esta razón tienen una "aversión culinaria" a la leche y sus derivados, por esta razón se han consumido en algunas partes de Asia, áfrica, aunque su consumo más reconocido es en el norte de Europa y en aquellos lugares donde la colonización de estos pueblos ha sido significante: Norteamérica y Australia. [3] Se ha estimado que casi un 96% de los europeos del norte pueden digerir la lactosa, entre un 50% hasta un 75% de los africanos, indios, habitantes de oriente medio y europeos del este, y casi todos los nativos americanos y asiáticos son incapaces de digerirla (debido a que sus cuerpos dejan de producir la enzima de la lactasa tras el periodo de lactancia). [2] [3]<br>  <br>  En la alimentación en la Antigua Grecia la leche (griego γ?λα, gála) es bebida por los campesinos pero no es casi empleada en las preparaciones culinarias. La mantequilla (griego βο?τυρον, boúturon) es conocida, pero también poco empleada: los griegos consideraban su uso como una característica de los tracios del norte del Egeo, a los que el poeta cómico Anaxándridas llama los ?comedores de mantequilla?[4] . En cambio, aprecian los productos lácteos. Se sirve como postre lo que debía parecerse al yogur, en griego πυριατ?[5] . Sobre todo, el queso (griego τυρ??, túros), de cabra o de oveja, era un alimento básico. Se la vende en distintas tiendas según sea o no fresco, costando el primero los dos tercios del precio del segundo[6] . Se come sólo o mezclado con miel o legumbres. Entra como ingrediente en la preparación de buen número de platos, incluidos los de pescado. La única receta conservada es del cocinero siciliano Mithaikos; ?[7] .<br>  <br>  La "carne y la leche" forman parte de la tradición judía sobre la comida etiquetada kosher y que se categoriza dentro de tres apartados: fleishig (carne y productos cárnicos), milchig (leche y los productos lácteos) y el parveh (alimentos neutrales, definidos en la categoría de los otros alimentos permitidos). Una amplia cantidad de reglas gobiernan la cocina y la gastronomía judía en estas tres categorías, de esta forma el 'fleishig y el milchig' no pueden ser combinados, mientras que si lo pueden hacer con los ingredientes 'parveh' debido a su posición neutral. A la observancia de no mezclar carne con la leche (o los productos lácteos) se le denomina: basar be halab.[3]<br>  <br>  Los lácteos fueron denominados "carnes blancas" y eran accesibles a las clases más humildes durante la Edad Media, llegando a ser una de las fuentes más importantes de grasas y de proteinas.[8] El queso llegó a ser popular debido a su 'relativo' bajo precio, se conservaba durante periodos de tiempo razonables y podía ser fácilmente transportado. A medida que las sociedades se fueron industrializando y se empezó a incorporar la refrigeración a los medios de transporte, los lácteos y la leche pudieron ser llevados a lugares lejanos de las zonas de producción, este fenómeno hizo que su consumo fuera en crecimiento durante el siglo XIX y siglo XX. La invención de la pasteurización ayudó a mejorar los periodos de caducidad de los productos y el éxito de los lácteos se unió a la mejora de productividad de leche experimentada en los paises del norte de Europa. [9] Se sabe que la demanda fue creciendo en las áreas urbanas desde el siglo XVII y que llegaron a ser un medio de alimentación muy importante de los trabajadores industriales y pronto se empezó a regular su calidad desde las autoridades sanitarias. En el siglo XIX se desarrollan nuevos lácteos: aparecen las leches concentradas y vaporizadas que permiten un mejor transporte y conservación.<br>  <br>  El siglo XX es el periodo de tiempo donde la leche y los lácteos sufren una fuerte expansión a lo largo de todo el planeta, las mejoras en los métodos de orde?e, alimentación y selección natural de las especies, transporte y refrigeración, hicieron que se produjera la paradoja de la "sobreproducción". Al mismo tiempo se empezaron a abrir serios debates acerca de lo adecuado de sus valores nutricionales aplicados a una dieta sana....<br>  es lo que puedo  conpartir contigo <br>  saludos... <br>  atte<br>            frank valentino*****|`|yUdl5CrBaa	Nunca tomo leche de vaca... tomo leche de soya, es mas rica y nutritiva y me da las proteinas ke necesito =)
9446bc63177a155ee6ae4e75e2147f06aa	Nuestro karma NO se supone. Se recoge lo que se siembra., Si se siembra una buena semilla, se recoge una buena cosecha, de lo contrario, se recoge una mala cosecha.

Si es así, debes pasar la prueba. No hay nada que no podamos superar.<br>  Saludos|`|yad6ZSgwaa	El plano más denso de vibración energética es el plano 1, conocido como el mundo físico.  <br>  Hay dos planos espirituales por debajo del plano material: el -1 y el -2, pero por una “jugarreta dimensional” son invisibles para el ser encarnado, aunque no por ello más sutiles. <br>  Ya fue dicho que hay espíritus tan rebeldes y otros tan opuestos al plan de evolución que acrecientan su ego y “empalidecen” tanto que llegan a pasar por alto una nueva encarnación y descienden a alguno de esos planos negativos de vibración. <br>  El plano físico es el universo visible, donde los seres encarnados vienen a evolucionar, sea mediante el sufrimiento o por medio del Servicio. <br>  Se puede encarnar para revertir determinado karma o por una misión determinada. <br>    <br>  No es ninguna garantía el haber sido en una vida anterior una persona altruista o de elevada moral, pues al no  guardar en el presente la memoria de esa encarnación, se pueden cometer mil errores de comportamiento y contraer más karma en lugar de revertir los anteriores. <br>  ?Qué es un karma? ?Una Ley de Causa y Efecto? ?Una culpa a pagar? ?Una lección a aprender?  <br>  Un espíritu encarnado puede arrastrar uno o varios karmas. éstos son las barreras que  <br>  el hombre deberá afrontar a lo largo de la vida.  <br>  Partamos de la base de que todos los seres humanos viven más de una vida. Vuelven  <br>  a nacer tantas veces como cosas deban aprender. <br>  Son situaciones en las que se han equivocado en vidas anteriores y, en la actualidad, tienen así la obligación de adquirir el conocimiento necesario para no volver a errar. <br>  En realidad no se debe tomar el karma como una culpa a pagar, sino como una ense?anza que la vida da al espíritu que vino a evolucionar. <br>  Esta lección a aprender se llama karma, es decir, son los errores que el hombre cometió en otra vida, las obligaciones que eludió por cierta debilidad o negligencia, y ahora el destino, mediante situaciones forzadas, le hace saldar esa deuda y cancelar el efecto desafortunado de la misma. <br>  Y a su vez, aprender las lecciones que pueden llevarlo a ganar las experiencias necesarias para derribar esas barreras que le obstaculizan el triunfo. <br>  Por eso el hombre debe tomar el karma como una nueva oportunidad que, a través de distintos obstáculos, le permite remontar ese “debe”. Porque es necesario saber que quienes cometieron distintas transgresiones y abusaron de las leyes naturales en vidas pasadas, deberán pagar el precio hasta equilibrar la deuda kármica. No con castigos, pero sí asimilando conocimientos a través de diversos actos de abnegación. <br>  Esta Ley de Causa y Efecto es absoluta, infalible y eterna en el plano físico, que es el mundo de la manifestación. <br>  El ser humano crea las causas y el karma ajustará los efectos para restablecer el equilibrio. <br>  Es  importante saber que todo acontecimiento siempre ocurre como consecuencia de otro anterior, pues existe estrecha relación entre lo que ha sucedido y lo que sucederá.|`|8gNBEC1paa	lo ignoro|`|g2Weiqpsaa	No se puede; si no se vive, volverá siempre|`|t4HLg1Rdaa	hola amiga de nuevo bueno sobre el carma pienso y doy <br>  preguntas y respuestas.Los patrones de memoria son extremadamente magnéticos. Ellos hacen que pasemos por un tipo de experiencias que hacen que nos preguntemos, "?Por qué me tiene que suceder esto? ?Qué hice para atraer esto? ?Qué hice para causar esto? No me merezco que me suceda esto." Las vibraciones que causan estas experiencias se pusieron en efecto en esta vida o en una vida anterior. Ponemos en movimiento fuerzas pránicas dentro de patrones de memoria grabados, ocasionando que debamos enfrentar sus reacciones en esta vida. Nosotros enfrentamos esas reacciones en forma colectiva, a través de otras personas, o a través de nuestra propia acción. Nos sentimos impelidos a hacer ciertas cosas. ?Por qué? Nosotros lo llamamos karma. Karma significa causa y efecto.<br>  pieso de esa forma:Cuando provocamos una perturbación traumática en nosotros mismos o en otros, la acción es grabada en los patrones de memoria del chakra muladhara. La semilla ha sido plantada y se mantendrá vibrando en las profundidades de la mente, aunque haya sido conscientemente olvidada. La llevamos con nosotros de una vida a la otra, de nacimiento a nacimiento, hasta que un día brota en el fruto de nuestra acción-reacción.<br>  eso es lo que me esta pasando ami sobre el accidente<br>  que tuve hace menos del mes<br>   todo lo que se me grabo en mi subconciente se me esta reflejando  en mi vida diaria.<br>  por lo tanto  lo puedo sentir muy cerca de mi vida..<br>  Los patrones de la razón del chakra svadhishthana, inmediatamente por arriba de la memoria, no comprenden para nada estas experiencias, debido a que ese chakra funciona en una frecuencia distinta. Entonces, solamente una vez que el evento a tenido lugar, o los impulsos han llegado, podemos nosotros analizarlos racionalmente. Debido a que nosotros hemos olvidado nuestra vida pasada y nos hemos quedado sólo con las reverberaciones pránicas que se hallan profundamente alojadas en las células de memoria, no conocemos las causas. Aún más, parecería que no existen causas para muchas de las cosas que nos suceden en la vida, ni razón o justificación. Esto puede ser muy frustrante. No obstante, eso es karma, y es generalmente expresado diciendo, " Es karma." Es un efecto a una causa previa.<br>  espero ayudarte en algo sobre estas nueva experiencias<br>   vividas y palabras de mi pensar..<br>  saludos amiga...<br>  de tu amigo<br>                            frank valentino******|`|A22tehCmaa	Para qué recertirlo si lo puedes transformar en energía positiva pura por medio de la llama violeta que corresponde a la trasmutación.

AA11131985	The folded membrane of epithelial cells increases the total surface area for absorption of digested food molecules.  These folds are called microvilli, and collectively they are referred to as the 'brush border'. Situated on the cell membrane are carrier proteins which are specific to each type of nutrient.  The greater the surface area of the membrane, the more space there is for carrier proteins, so the faster the rate of absorption.|`|rITurSbSaa	By having folds the membrane has what is called a higher surface area. This just means that if the folds were flattened out the whole membrane would be longer than if it didn't have folds. <br>  This higher surface area provides more of a surface for the food to be digested, so can digest more food in the same amount of time than one without the folds could. In other words there is more surface for digestion.|`|1fa5489afe2b1f70d8a291392b7d6e9baa	They have fols and this gives them 'higher surface area'.

El efecto de esta toxina es semejante al curare. La concentracion de la misma varía según la etapa de maduración y las condiciones climáticas, encontrandose principalmente en los frutos verdes (0,73-0,98%), seguidos de los frutos maduros (0,50%) y hallándose en menor proporción en las flores (0,09-0,24%).<br>  <br>  Algunos gramos de frutos verdes serían suficientes para provocar la muerte de un humano (los rumiantes y los pájaros parecen ser resistentes), el caballo y el burro son poco sensibles, pero es un veneno violento para los bóvidos, los conejos y los carnívoros. En el humano, la ingestión provoca sobre la hora que sigue trastornos digestivos (especialmente cuando la raíz se utiliza), vértigos y cefaleas, parestesias, descenso de la temperatura corporal, reducción de la fuerza muscular, y finalmente una parálisis ascendente. La muerte puede sobrevenir debido a que las convulsiones y la destrucción muscular produzcan una insuficiencia renal, o debido a las alteraciones que produce en la respiración (acelerándola al principio y deprimiendola luego), que llevarían a una muerte por asfixia.<br>  <br>  Puede presentarse intoxicación accidental por su parecido con el apio, el nabo o perejil y otras plantas que sirven de alimento o condimento, a pesar de que existen diferencias entre estas plantas y la cicuta, como el tama?o, el olor distintamente desagradable (el perejil tiene un olor agradable característico) y las manchas del rojo en los vástagos, siempre ausentes en el perejil.<br>  <br>

Ujxrpoonaa	Usually, the wind blows strongly from east to west along the equator in the Pacific. This actually piles up water (about half a meter's worth) in the western part of the Pacific. In the eastern part, deeper water (which is colder than the sun-warmed surface water) gets pulled up from below to replace the water pushed west. So, the normal situation is warm water (about 30 C) in the west, cold (about 22 C) in the east.<br>  <br>  In an El Ni?o, the winds pushing that water around get weaker. As a result, some of the warm water piled up in the west slumps back down to the east, and not as much cold water gets pulled up from below. Both these tend to make the water in the eastern Pacific warmer, which is one of the hallmarks of an El Ni?o.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't stop there. The warmer ocean then affects the winds--it makes the winds weaker! So if the winds get weaker, then the ocean gets warmer, which makes the winds get weaker, which makes the ocean get warmer ... this is called a positive feedback, and is what makes an El Ni?o grow.<br>  <br>  A strong El Ni?o is often associated with wet winters over the southeastern US, as well as drought in Indonesia and Australia. Keep in mind that you aren't guaranteed these effects even though there is an El Ni?o going on; but the El Ni?o does make these effects more likely to happen.<br>  |`|bdb0888fd136a63d205345956538d841aa	everything you need to know .<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1...</a>

I6nopGJJaa	Clasificación<br>  <br>  Hay 3 tipos de micosis, que se clasifican por su localización (hay hongos capaces de producir las 3 micosis):<br>  <br>  Cutáneas (superficiales). Afectan al estrato córneo de la piel y anejos cutáneos: pelos, plumas, cuernos, u?as... Dentro de los hongos que las causan distinguimos los saprofíticos (aprovechan el mal estado de la piel) y los hongos patógeno primarios (comen queratina).<br>  <br>  Subcutáneas. Afectan al tejido subcutáneo y la piel.<br>  <br>  Profundas (sistemáticas). Afectan a órganos internos.<br>  <br>  Hay que destacar que nunca se producen micosis digestivas.<br>  <br>  Patogenia general de las micosis<br>  <br>  Acción mecánica. Los filamentos, cuando penetran en el tejido lo disocian y rompen las fibras.<br>  <br>  Acción irritativa/inflamatoria. Las inflamaciones son reacciones de defensa del organismo. La van produciendo conforme van avanzando.<br>  <br>  Acción bioquímica destructiva. Enzimas proteolíticos que rompen células.<br>  <br>  Acción tóxica. Muchas enzimas son toxinas que matan células y provocan focos necróticos.<br>  <br>  Acción antigénica (alergénica). Producen un determinado tipo de hipersensibilidad al sistema inmune -! lesiones estériles (ni el agente, ni la toxina se encuentra ya allí)<br>  <br>  Micosis profundas.<br>  <br>  No son contagiosas.<br>  <br>  Penetran, generalmente por inhalación de esporas. Se asientan primero en los pulmones, y de ahí se diseminan al resto de órganos.<br>  <br>  Si no llegan a los pulmones llegan al cerebro (por ejemplo, micosis rinocerebral) por las vías nasales superiores (senos paranasales, lámina cribosa, etc.).<br>  <br>  Están producidas por 3 tipos de hongos:<br>  <br>  Hongos filamentosos (micociliares). Aspergilosis, zigomicosis; hongos oportunistas.<br>  <br>  Levaduras. Candidiosis, criptococosis.<br>  <br>  Hongos dimórficos. Son hongos que en la naturaleza presentan forma de hongo filamentoso (micelar), y en la lesión (penetran por heridas abiertas) aparecen como hongos unicelulares, por eso son hongos dimórficos. En laboratorio, a elevadas temperaturas y con medios de cultivo determinados se consiguen las 2 formas. Son patógenos primarios de histoplasmosis, coccidiomicosis y paracoccodiomicosis.<br>  <br>  Micosis subcutáneas<br>  <br>  No se contagian, excepto las esporotricosis.<br>  <br>  Se producen por implantación de esporas o micelio en tejido subcutáneo directamente: esporotricosis (por hongo dimórfico), feohifomicosis, lobomicosis, cromomicosis, micetomas eumicóticos (hongos saprofíticos), rinosporidiosis (hongos saprofíticos). Esta última no ha podido ser aislada.<br>  <br>  La vía de penetración es la piel. Provoca procesos inflamatorios con lesiones típicas.<br>  <br>  Micosis cutáneas<br>  <br>  Son contagiosas, sobre todo la ti?a.<br>  <br>  Dermatofotosis, piedra blanca y negra, dermatomicosis producida por hongos oportunistas.<br>  <br>  Métodos de estudio<br>  <br>  Las micosis tienden a diagnosticarse más de la cuenta: no todo lo que se diagnostica como tal es una micosis, ni hongos (por ejemplo: se confunden dermatitis de estafilococos). ?Cómo diagnosticarlo bien?<br>  <br>  Toma de muestras. La muestra debe ser representativa: que provenga del lugar de la lesión, que tenga un tama?o adecuado para poder trabajar con él.<br>  <br>  Examen directo de la lesión. Para ver si aparecen estructuras de hongos.<br>  <br>  En la orina y líquidos en general (sangre, líquido cefalorraquídeo), se hace un frotis.<br>  <br>  Con los sólidos hay que ablandarlos primero (por ejemplo, si se trata de pelos). Si el animal no es de gran tama?o se puede pasar por la lámpara de Wood, de UV. El pelo parasitado emite una fluorescencia visible a simple vista.

480c9bc9014552d7a82bf56188e983c6aa	Hi. Googled "ice cores" and found lots of info. The brief answer is, "No, the Earth (and its frozen parts) has changed significantly, several times, in its history."  The Bible is a wonderful book, but the science in it is a bit dated. For more info, read on and/or follow some of the links below.<br>  <br>  "Ice cores contain an abundance of climate information. Inclusions in the snow of each year remain in the ice, such as wind-blown dust, ash, bubbles of atmospheric gas and radioactive substances. The variety of climatic proxies is greater than in any other natural recorder of climate, such as tree rings or sediment layers. These include (proxies for) temperature, ocean volume, precipitation, chemistry and gas composition of the lower atmosphere, volcanic eruptions, solar variability, sea-surface productivity, desert extent and forest fires.<br>  An ice core from the right site can be used to reconstruct an uninterrupted and detailed climate record extending over hundreds of thousands of years, providing information on a wide variety of aspects of climate at each point in time. It is the simultaneity of these properties recorded in the ice that makes ice cores such a powerful tool in paleoclimate research."<br>  <br>  "Locked within two cores of ancient ice is evidence of unprecedented swings in Earth's climate throughout the ages. These icy archives tell us that large, rapid, global change is more the norm for the Earth's climate than is stasis.<br>  Two projects conducted from 1989 to 1993 collected parallel ice cores just 30 kilometers apart from the central part of the Greenland ice sheet. Each core is more than 3 kilometers deep and extends back 110,000 years. In short, the ice cores tell a clear story: humans came of age agriculturally and industrially during the most stable climatic regime recorded in the cores. They also indicate that today, Greenland is roughly 20°C warmer than it once was.<br>      Scientists who have studied the cores agree that the Earth experienced large, rapid, regional-to-global climate oscillations through most of the last 110,000 years...The almost perfect match back to this date between records from the two cores should dispel any lingering doubt about the climatic origin of the events. These millennial-scale events represent large climate deviations that probably include change in temperature of many degrees Celsius, twofold changes in snow accumulation, large changes in how much wind-blown dust and sea salt were carried by the atmosphere, and large changes in methane concentration."|`|646b54ea91f883c15459a479fb27dacfaa	Was is 3,705 years ago? Ah, it seems like only yesterday, I'll never forget it because it was the day my wife and children were tragically taken from me (I found out later that it was the result of some silly wager, but no matter, I got a new and better family so alls well that ends well). <br>  <br>  No my friend in fact the ice is quite different. Why only the other day God was mentioning how he missed all that ice on the polar caps and on mountain tops. Those were the good old days, oh well, nothing lasts forever. <br>  <br>  On the bright side, God did happen to mention in passing that Hell was a little cooler than normal for this time of year so I guess it all evens out.|`|0bb3752ef2d29c29ce2dac726d49f14baa	Under any circumstances, the "frozen parts of the earth" will be quite different 3,705 years ago than they are now due to both natural and human-accelerated climate change... so no, it would not be the same.

Il vento spinge la corda fino a che l'elasticita'  del materiale non la riporta indietro il ripetersi di questo fenomeno  genera un onda stazionaria che a seconda del diametro e della lunghezza della corda stessa genera una nota. Lo stesso fenomeno in scala molto grande puo' causare il crollo di un ponte o di un edificio in questo caso si parla di carico armonico . La cassa armonica dell' arpa funziona poi da amplificatore risuonando alla frequenza della corda permette di sentire il suono che date le piccole energie in gioco (pochi microwatt) non sarebbe udibile|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Le arpe eolie.

XKbJmTdDaa	Chemical energy is converted into electrical energy|`|BtTHFNgVaa	There are different kinds of batteries, but typically a battery involves a chemical reaction that generates a flow of electrons in one direction, which is the electrical power the battery supplies.  The difference in energy potential is the voltage, and the amount of electrons is related to the current.<br>  <br>  Most batteries are rechargeable, meaning that when the flow is reversed (by applying a voltage in the opposite direction), the chemical reaction driving the battery is forced in reverse, causing electrical energy to be stored in the battery.  In a perfect battery this could be done infinitely to release and store energy.   However, in the real world, no chemical reaction is perfectly reversible, and so even rechargeable batteries lost their ability to store charge.

Ogni persona racconta una storia diversa, ad esempio c'è mchi dice che non si ricorda bene perchè gli alieni gli hanno cancellato la memoria. Le distanze che ci separano da altri pianeti sono di almeno qualche anno luce e gli alieni impiegherebbero molto tempo per venire sulla Terra (sempre se non viaggiano alla velocità della luce). Se avessero veramente raggiunto la Terra secondo me avrebbero già stabilito un contatto con noi da molto tempo, ma se anche ciò fosse vero non sappiamo quali sono i loro piani e quindi non possiamo supporre nulla. Non so se hai visto le persone che al "Bivio" hanno affermato di essere state rapite dagli alieni. Appena chiedevano loro di dare delle prove si rifiutavano. ma allora perchè andare in televisione? Forse gli alieni sono già stati sulla Terra molto tempo fa (diciamo anche centinaia di mioini di anni fa) ma non hanno trovato forme di vita intelligenti. Forse le persone che contano hanno già scoperto qualcosa ma non ci raccontano niente. Noi forse non potremo mai sapere la verità, perchè molte volte ci viene negata. Comunque io credo fermamente nell'esistenza di forme di vita extraterrestri perchè l'Universo è talmente vasto (quello conosciuto arriva a 15 miliardi di anni luce) che penso sia impossibile che la Terra sia l'unico pianeta che ospita la vita.|`|43cdcc4969a1accbe9f3cdb9e74ead2baa	Credo agli alieni, ma non ai rapimenti.<br>  La probabilità che nell'universo ci siano altre forme di vita (intelligenti o no) è altissima, basti pensare alle milioni di galassie che esistono.<br>  Gli alieni non ci hanno mai rapito, secondo me perché non capisco il motivo per cui lo farebbero.

n77sPyegaa	The stuff responsible for making our eyes go bad if we look at the Sun, is UVA and UVB radiation, not brightness nor heat. The Sun emmits those rays like crazy, while the lightning doesn't. You could be in the brightest of all the rooms, but that will never hurt your eyes.<br>  <br>  BTW, the reason lightnin could damage your eyes if you are too close, it's because they will get burned.<br>  <br>  Just for the record, sitting too close to the TV might cause eye fatige, but will not blind you :)<br>  <br>  PS. Do not hold me responsible if the TV somehow does blind you :P<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  I haven't seen any electromagnetic spectrum for lightning, but I'm pretty sure it just doesn't emmit as much UVA and UVB rays as the Sun does. Only UVA and UVB rays are harmful to us. Other types of UV rays are not bad|`|2LwrGcReaa	It has more to do with time.  a lightning flash only lasts for a few milliseconds, while the sun is constant.  Conversely, if you look at the sun for only a brief instant, it causes no serious damage.|`|GbaEEJvKaa	Lightning is actually 6 times hotter than the surface of the sun. The reason why the sun is dangerous to stare at is because the sun emits UV rays and they are bad for the eye, and secondly it's bright. However, lightning is bright too, but it doesn't release UV rays that can harm the eyes, unless you were very close to a strike.|`|889d2ad7aa7694086c556500c167e31baa	My guess would be the duration.

Now go compare the area of the Sun with the area of the luminous area of a lightning... <br>  <br>  The danger from the brightness of a welding arc comes from its proximity, as light intensity decreases as 1/r^2. A welding arc is much smaller than lightnint, but also much, much closer. A welding arc at 50-100 m away does not put much of a danger.<br>  <br>  To find how much energy you get from a thermal source, you have to take into account all three: brightness per surface area (black body law), area of the body, and distance from the body.<br>  <br>  Comment to Nick: the a hotter source (lightning) emits MORE energy as UV radiation than a colder one (Sun), per unit surface, both as fraction of total energy and as absolute value.|`|d89f2231c85bb71d45c88ab2169334bcaa	it would be if it were close enought to u, but usually it is in the distance and it is so quick that it is not as harmful as a welding light or looking at the sun<br>  u can quickly look at the sun, but not for long and not all teh time right?

dd1976614068bff18ea9955aa13de3ffaa	I'd try a 9:1:1 mixture of hexane:EtOAc:AcOH.  Adding an acid will keep the carboxylic acids from streaking.  Increase the amount of EtOAc until the spots move.  I usually have stock solutions of all TLC eluents made up and keep trying until you get resolution.  If Hex/EtOAc doesn't work, you can try a CH2Cl2/MeOH approach.|`|6e3e98ceb5b2fe6bc0fe7b0bbdfbca3aaa	You need a more polar solvent, but one that won't react with the eluents. So, you could go with an alcohol (methanol) or a hetrocyclic compound (pyridine). You really can't use a ketone (like methyl ethyl ketone) because it can react with the acids. Methanol is quick and easy.<br>  <br>  The reason it needs to be more polar is that the eluents are dropping out so quickly relative to the nonpolar hexane solvent. There is little resolution because they barely move beyond the start point.

b7b52d66682f323b365e74683b02ab9eaa	The climate system varies both through natural, "internal" processes as well as in response to variations in external "forcing" from both human and non-human causes, including solar activity, volcanic emissions, and greenhouse gases. Climatologists agree that the earth has warmed recently. The detailed causes of this change remain an active field of research, but the scientific consensus identifies greenhouse gases as the primary cause of the recent warming. Outside of the scientific community, however, this conclusion can be controversial.<br>  <br>  Adding carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) to Earth's atmosphere, with no other changes, will make the planet's surface warmer; greenhouse gases create a natural greenhouse effect without which temperatures on Earth would be an estimated 30 °C (54 °F) lower, and the Earth uninhabitable. It is therefore not correct to say that there is a debate between those who "believe in" and "oppose" the theory that adding carbon dioxide or methane to the Earth's atmosphere will, absent any mitigating actions or effects, result in warmer surface temperatures on Earth. Rather, the debate is about what the net effect of the addition of carbon dioxide and methane will be, when allowing for compounding or mitigating factors.<br>  <br>  One example of an important feedback process is ice-albedo feedback. The increased CO2 in the atmosphere warms the Earth's surface and leads to melting of ice near the poles. As the ice melts, land or open water takes its place. Both land and open water are less reflective than ice, and so absorb more solar radiation. This causes more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and the cycle continues.<br>  <br>  Due to the thermal inertia of the earth's oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects, the Earth's current climate is not in equilibrium with the forcing imposed by increased greenhouse gases. Climate commitment studies indicate that, even if greenhouse gases were stabilized at present day levels, a further warming of perhaps 0.5 °C to 1.0 °C (0.9–1.8 °F) would still occur.|`|AA10925430	probably the cause of global warming would be the high emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide causes a wall around the outside of the atmosphere. That wall traps the suns uv rays, causing the earth to become hotter. Most countries in the world have to burn coal for electricity, and when burning coal it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We need to think of alternative power sources that are good for the environment, such as nuclear power plants.<br>  <br>  Because of global warming our earth's temperature is slowly rising. in a couple of years these changes could be permanent. Because of global warming, at the north and south poles, the icebergs are melting rapidly, causing sea levels to rise. If these sea levels rise, some places in the world like fiji, vanuatu, and some other islands may disappear completely because of the high water levels.|`|2e87adc4c6d8d644ad1f74773a6e8edbaa	Global Warming is the result of chronic & cyclic changes in the environment of the Earth ....which have been going on since millions of years..<br>  Green house gases like CO, CO2 , methane ..etc contribute a little in trapping the heat rays.|`|7f88d8be0181ce9d278374f2ea7e982eaa	2 Causes.<br>  <br>  GreenHouse Effect:<br>  <br>  The greenhouse gases help us from the ultraviolet rays exposing to us. The greenhouse gases should not be too much or less. One of the greenhouse gases are C02 (carbon dioxide). Now from 1700s the use of C02 (carbon dioxide has increased 30%. So the greenhouse gases are increasing. Even though there is much, the ultraviolet ways sstill can penetrate the blanket of greenhouse gases. But the heat cannot escape, because of the amount of greenhouse gases.<br>  <br>  2. Ozone Layer<br>  <br>  The Ozone Layer protect the ultraviolet rays too, CFCs of chlolorflourocarbons become chlorines when they are near the ozone because the rays are mopre effective. When chlorines expose to the ozone layer they break down the molocules that make up the ozone layer. Scientists discovered a hole of the ozone layer over Antarctica and Arctic so that's effecting the Global Warming too.|`|9a3af82d576187f5b08e0f9c488c2af5aa	Earth receives continuously solar energy in all spectrum range.

The planet has warmed (and cooled) many times during the 4.65 billion years of its history. At present Earth appears to be facing a rapid warming, which most scientists believe results, at least in part, from human activities. The chief cause of this warming is thought to be the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which releases into the atmosphere carbon dioxide and other substances known as greenhouse gases and the deforestation. As the atmosphere becomes richer in these gases, it becomes a better insulator, retaining more of the heat provided to the planet by the Sun.<br>  <br>  The average surface temperature of Earth is about 15°C (59°F). Over the last century, this average has risen by about 0.6 Celsius degrees (1 Fahrenheit degree). Scientists predict further warming of 1.4 to 5.8 Celsius degrees (2.5 to 10.4 Fahrenheit degrees) by the year 2100. This temperature rise is expected to melt polar ice caps and glaciers as well as warm the oceans, all of which will expand ocean volume and raise sea level by an estimated 9 to 100 cm (4 to 40 in), flooding some coastal regions and even entire islands. Some regions in warmer climates will receive more rainfall than before, but soils will dry out faster between storms. This soil desiccation may damage food crops, disrupting food supplies in some parts of the world. Plant and animal species will shift their ranges toward the poles or to higher elevations seeking cooler temperatures and species that cannot do so may become extinct. The potential consequences of global warming are so great that many of the world's leading scientists have called for international cooperation and immediate action to counteract the problem.<br>  <br>  MEASURING<br>  <br>  <br>  In the early 1986, scientists suggested that burning fossil fuels might change the composition of the atmosphere but he can’t prove it during that time.<br>  But in 1957, they were able to confirm their hypothesis, how? They started a program called International Geophysical Year; they set some instrument on top of the Hawaiian Volcano the Mauna Loa. Their instruments indicated that CO2 was rising.<br>  After that experiment they continue to track the condition of the atmosphere using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Weather Satellite<br>  <br>  The 3 hottest years occurred after 1990<br>  And 1998 is the warmest year of all<br>  <br>  <br>  WEATHER EFFECT<br>  <br>  1.Weather – the northern hemisphere will heat up more.<br>  a.Regions that experienced light snow fall may receive no snow at all<br>  b.El Nino phenomenon<br>  c.Increase in production of cloud that will slow down the warming process<br>  d.More rainfall because of the greater humidity<br>  e.Melting of  ice in Polar regions that may cause;<br>  <br>  2.Increase in Sea Level - low coastal areas will be submerged in water.<br>  <br>  3.

Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. There are three phases of matter: solid, liquid and gas. Some people describe plasma as a fourth phase of matter, but I have no knowledge about nor care for it.<br>  <br>  A solid object has molecules that are closer to each other. Liquid has molecules that have wider spaces between them; gas molecules have the widest.<br>  <br>  Air is just a mixture of gases in the environment.|`|edf653b331b98b1d6153684817b6cbdeaa	b'coz every matter ocupies space<br>  dats y dere is no space in air|`|ef658699ac0cb6328aa9de70ea00b22caa	Air as we know is of gaseous state. And the tendency of gaseous matter is to have loosely arranged molecules and atom. If u mean the space as the loose arrangement then absolutely your question is wrong. But Considering the nature of rheology of air, it has no specific structure of it's own and always depends on the vessel in which, is contained in. There is no restriction in the direction of flow and can fill the spaces and occupies it. Until or otherwise pressure is positive/ negative to restrict the movement no space can be created. Since the space will be filled in by air , Air will not have space. <br>  If to talk on negative pressure say a vacuum, the case is entirely different. Hope so you understand it better.
2430552f9df03330c63a412a1f018406aa	Negative feedback involves a stimulus resulting in an opposite reaction. For example, high temperature detected by thermoreceptors results in sweatting which will cause a fall in temperature. The fall in temperature means that the stimulus has been removed and sweating therefore stops.<br>  <br>  Positive feedback involves a stimulus resulting in furthering a response. Eg. depolarization of a cell causes sodium to enter, which furthers depolarization, causing even more sodium to enter more rapidly.|`|0b8c05aa668d756e4b0d475ea50c27adaa	Both are regulatory mechanisms.  <br>  <br>  Negative feedback is like the thermostat in your ref.  When the required temperature is reached (they call this the set point), the thermostat turns the cooling system off.  Of course since the cooler is "off", after a while the ref heats up and this temperature increase causes the thermostat to turn the system back on so the temperature is returned to the set point.  You probably have heard your ref turn on and off automatically. This is similar to what happens in human bodies maintaining "normal" body temperatures.<br>  <br>  Positive feedback does not have this see-saw relationship.  It's like your pressure cooker.  The hotter the it becomes, the greater the pressure inside it gets.  This cannot go on forever. Something's got to give!  The vent on top of the cooker is there for that purpose.  In humans, coughing and birthing are often given as examples of positive feedback.  (things comes out of the body in both examples)|`|4b7030265199bb6af0446843a3799127aa	well you are confused|`|ae244d61f1f0383fb452c771c5825797aa	In the context of biology positive feed back would be a process which increases intensity.  Negative feedback would be the opposite.  For example, in the body enzyme A causes the production of enzyme B.  In a positive feedback system the  enzyme B product loops back to cause more enzyme A production which in turn increases the production of enzyme B. This cycle continues increasing both enzyme A and B.  In a negative feedback system,  A produces B but B then stimulates the reduction of enzyme A slowing down the process.  A biology text should be able to give you specific examples of these processes.|`|ea8e866c55c1544e8f8429d6ada3ddc1aa	positive feedback --The horse didn't swallow<br>  negative feedback-- The horse swallowed<br>  similarities--swallow<br>  differences--ED<br>  I got this information from the horses mouth, his name is Mr.ED|`|AA11253368	Hi Diana,  Positive very good.

Do you need help!!<br>  <br>    Clowmy|`|a4cf5554d631a28e8bfe6222b96b90acaa	Negative feedback can be likened to an inverse relationship between two variables.  In other words, when one variable goes up, the other variable will go down so that equilibrium (or balance) is reached.  For example, when the weather is very cold, your body interprets the extreme decrease in temperature and you shiver --- the coldness is a DECREASE in temperature & the shivering INCREASES your body temperature.<br>  <br>  Positive feedback is just the opposite; when one variable goes up, the other goes up as well (or both can go down).  From my understanding, positive feedback STRAYS away from an equilibrium state.  Your variables continue to move in just one direction.  For example, you may have heard the saying, "the rich get richer."  The "action" state is only going in one direction, which (in this previous case) is UP.<br>  <br>  Hope this made sense. . . Good luck!

El pelo del cuero cabelludo, denominado cabello, crece por término medio 1 mm cada 3 días, mientras que las pesta?as y el vello corporal lo hacen con más lentitud.<br>  <br>  Cada pelo consiste en una raíz (radix pili) ubicada en un folículo piloso (folliculus pili) y en un tallo (scapus pili) que se proyecta hacia arriba por encima de la superficie de la epidermis. La raíz se agrandada en su base (bulbus pili). La zona papilar (papilla pili) está compuesta de tejido conjuntivo y vasos sanguíneos, que proporcionan al pelo las sustancias necesarias para su crecimiento.<br>  <br>  Una glándula sebácea desemboca dentro de cada folículo. Existe un manojo de fibras musculares lisas unidas a cada pelo. La contracción de los músculos hace que el pelo se erize, cambiando así su ángulo con relación a la piel, este proceso incrementa las posibilidades aislantes de la cubierta del pelo, proporcionando así una mejor cubierta contra el frío.<br>  <br>  El tallo (scapus pili), comprende tres capas. La médula, que consiste en células queratinizadas, laxamente unidas y está presente solamente en los pelos más gruesos (pelo de guardia) el espacio intercelular esta lleno de aire. La médula esta rodeada de la corteza, están fuertemente adheridas entre sí. En la corteza se fijan la mayoría de los gránulos de pigmento. Su superficie está cubierta con un tegumento, en este las células pueden estar adheridas o bien separadas en las porciones terminales, formando escamas.<br>  <br>  Los pelos sufren continuas modificaciones, cuando terminan de crecer, la reproducción de las células indiferenciadas de la base del folículo también se detiene, la raíz se hace progresivamente más estrecha y las células que se encuentran encima de la paila sufren un proceso de cornificación. Finalmente, la raíz se separa de la paila del pelo y este se cae, antes de que se desprenda, se inicia la formación de un nuevo pelo en la base del folículo.|`|2ee9e10894ca4e3cbc0df326a6a00076aa	Hola Gabys.<br>  Los cabel?los humanos sí están compuestos por células.<br>  <br>  Salu2.|`|6e9121ec9fa1b347d50dc5fe28f1349caa	Si. El cabello crece formando nuevas células en la base de la raíz. Estas células se multiplican para formar un bastón de tejido en la piel. Estos bastones de células se mueven hacia arriba a través de la piel, a medida que las nuevas células se forman debajo de las mismas. A medida que se desplazan hacia arriba, se los aparta de su provisión de nutrientes y comienzan a formar una proteína dura llamada queratina en un proceso llamado queratinización. A medida que se produce este proceso, las células del cabello mueren.

OOQa7Mr1aa	La respuesta es simple, no te puedes ver en el espejo porque sencillamente no puedes viajar más rápido que la luz. Ahora, si viajaras a una velocidad cercana a la de la luz, tu no notarías ninguna diferencia, porque el espejo no se mueve con respecto a ti. Para ti, el espejo se mantiene inmovil, y un rayo de luz se mueve a la velocidad "c" (300.000 km/s aprox.), tal como ocurre mientras lees esto.

Use the factor theorem to find the values of b, c and d, which end up being 0, -9 and 0 respectively. Plotting the graph is easy. You have been given the roots of the polynomial so these must be the points where the curve crosses the x-axis. The inequality can then easily be solved using your graph, or multiplying both sides of the inequality by x!

df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	Sharks don't go around attacking everything the moment something edible is in the water. <br>  First, they have to be hungry (they probably feed some time before people enter the habitat)<br>  Second, they have to be looking for the right prey. This means that it must be the right size and be either injured or weak. Sharks are looking for prey that displays odd movement (splashing, erratic movement) or blood.  <br>  Third, the shark must then investigate/evaluate the prey. Generally they'll spend time circling, bumping and otherwise challenging the prey to display some type of response. If the prey continues to exhibit weak or erratic behavior, the shark may then taste the prey. If the prey responds energetically or aggressively to the shark's testing, the shark will generally back off. <br>  Sharks are actually fairly timid animals. They don't want to be hurt and they want to make sure that their prey is either weak and unable to respond or is taken completely by surprised, ambushed and then allowed to weaken by loss of blood. <br>  Sand tigers are generally a fairly docile species and are more easily kept in captivity which is why you often see them in aquaria.|`|qaiYanF2aa	I used to swim around sand sharks all the time and they were quite harmless.  Usually only 18-24 inches long and hung around the docks eating fish entrails the fisherman threw in for them.  <br>  <br>  I don't know how big these were but if they were fed and there was no panic movement or smell of blood they wouldn't attack anyway.  The 'panic' movement is usually when something is in distress and dying and of course, the blood smell - that is legendary.<br>  <br>  Usually people that are attacked are doing a lot of splashing and kicking around and attract the shark because he feels these are victims to be had.  Also people swimming remind them of seals which is one of many sharks 'favorite dinners'.|`|RCpkdx4haa	Two reasons: One, they were fed before the workers entered the tank. Two, sharks are ambush hunters. They almost exclusively attack from the bottom up, meaning, most of their bigger pray is on the surface of the water and the shark attacks from beneath.

Some tablets may not contain "aspirin" but other type of analgesics such as ibuprofen instead.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
5gG2OfHIaa	I read all of your comments.  My impression is that you are experiencing adjustment disorder associated with young adulthood.  Your sexual indifference may related to being a "late life child."  Or the child of an upper income-class family.  Of course, that is speculation.   I would suggest that you review the most recent edition of the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual.  This manual is the "bible" of the psychiatric community in making a diagnosis.  The current edition should the 5th or 4th.   Your library should have a copy from which you access multiple potential diagnoses.  I kind of feel that you do not meet the diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis.  Your reflective and introspective nature is more of a personality type.  Not a disorder.  You may find more color in your life after a few months out of school.  In deed, you may consider after a break, the possibility of returning for a professional or graduate degree.|`|klmAEcCraa	yes, i do think you are clinicaly depressed. i want you to see a dr.|`|AA12060117	It sounds like you may be depressed.

It is a very serious condition BUT it IS NOT<br>  so common. <br>  The major risk factors are  # kidney problems   # liver disease   <br>  # alcohol abuse <br>  # old patient ( about 70 or more)<br>  #dehydration.<br>  <br>  If you have any of the symptoms listed above, what you should do  is to go to a hospital (emergency unit). IF have lactic acidosis it doesn't matter HOW you got the symptoms  because you need medical treatment anyway.<br>  Later on blood test can give more information concerning the  exact cause of acidosis.<br>  <br>  So, you can not know by yourself, butas you are worried I would recommend next time you experience drowsiness you should check with your doctor or go to a hospital.
YYLybWHSaa	Saying a 'plentiful supply of rainfall' does not tell you how evenly the rain is dispersed across the year. The rainforest with a seasonal monsoon must have plants adapted to dry periods and deluges during the wet season. These may not get rain over the entire year but still receive ~50 inches of precipitation. These forests usually shed some or most of the leaf canopy in the dry season making them a deciduous forest. This lets sunlight into the ground allowing a denser understory growth at ground level. Trees tend to be shorter. Bamboo thickets can be found .<br>  <a href="http://www.travel-university.org/general/geography/vegetation/monsoon.htmlhttp://books.google.com/books?id=bvDHB3o3RjEC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=rainforest+bamboo+monsoon&source=bl&ots=WD1oTToZOo&sig=AMmOoXhKAVUi6OKyK0Eagi97Zq4&hl=en&ei=xASnSaGTE4S6nQemnZX5Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result" rel="nofollow">http://www.travel-university.org/general...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Some equatorial rainforests have some 80 inches of rain spread evenly throughout the year.  These forests have very little difference in temperatures or day length year round. They have no dormant season so they have a constant canopy cover making them evergreen. This makes for very little ground level light so the understory plants must have different strategies to grow. Here vines and epiphytes are common plants. Vines often fold their leaves to prevent rain collecting & pulling the vines off their supports with increased weight. Leaves have drip tips to tips to guide water off. Fast drying discourages the growth of other organisms on the leaf surface. Leaves often even have ridges & furrows to channel the rain off. Both dew and rainfall can keep a leaf wet for significant portions of the year in this habitat. Water can block stomata and allow growth of microbes on the leaf surface that would block sunlight and the plants ability to photosynthesize.<br>  <a href="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/rainfo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/rai...</a><br>  <a href="http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0405.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0405.htm</a><br>  Each of these are very different yet can be said to have warm temperatures and a plentiful supply of rainfall.<br>  <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/forests.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/bi...</a>|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Put an arctic animal, say a musk ox, into the environment you describe and it would die - unless it could rapidly shed those features which were of benefit in the arctic (thick hairy coat and so on).|`|UmtOV8mRaa	They all have different adaptations suited only for certain conditions. Well, for example, humans are only adapted to life on land. If we tried to live underwater without all the things we need to survive, we'd die. Also races would be a great support. Put a caucasian in a tropical country where there is much more intensity of sunlight, he would later on faint or get heat stroke if he does not adapt himself to the warm climate. Or he could get skin cancer because he has less melanin in his skin to protect him from the sunlight.

If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as a pump or grinding stones, the machine is usually called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is then converted to electricity, the machine is called a wind generator, wind turbine, wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator.<br>  <br>  Wind turbines are designed to exploit the wind energy that exists at a location. Aerodynamic modeling is used to determine the optimum tower height, control systems, number of blades, and blade shape.<br>  <br>  Wind turbines convert wind energy to electricity for distribution. The turbine can be divided into three components. The rotor component, which is approximately 20% of the wind turbine cost, includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy. The generator component, which is approximately 34% of the wind turbine cost, includes the electrical generator, the control electronics, and most likely a gearbox component for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity. The structural support component, which is approximately 15% of the wind turbine cost, includes the tower and rotor pointing mechanism.

Rest quietly and keep your head elevated for 8 to 12 hours after surgery. Place a folded gauze over extraction sites for 2 to 3 hours. Bite down on the gauze with gentle pressure. Biting down with heavy pressure will make the muscles in your jaw ache. Do not change gauze pack more than once per hour. Oozing may occur for a few days.<br>  <br>  If bleeding is heavy, follow these directions: use a dry piece of gauze to remove blood; dampen a new piece of gauze and place it over the bleeding area only; bite down firmly for 20 minutes. If bleeding is heavy and constant you need to be seen by one of the doctors on call.<br>  <br>  Pain<br>  <br>  Take your pain medicine as directed. The medicines are prescribed to control pain and to prevent infection. It is best to take the pain medicine before the local anesthetic wears off. Then take the medicine on a regular schedule. To avoid an upset stomach, take the medicine with food.<br>  <br>  If you have not been given a prescription for pain, we anticipate that an over-the-counter pain reliever will be adequate.<br>  <br>  Swelling<br>  <br>  Some degree of swelling may be expected from most oral surgery. If swelling and pain increases after the 3rd day and you have a fever, you should talk to the doctor on call.<br>  <br>  To minimize swelling, apply an ice pack to your face as soon as possible after surgery. Leave the pack on for 15 minutes, then take it off for 15 minutes. Repeat this as needed for the first 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Do not apply heat to your face, unless told to do so. Heat can increase the swelling.<br>  <br>  Food and Drink<br>  <br>  Eat liquid or soft foods that can be chewed easily for the first two days. Try yogurt, instant cereals, cottage cheese, soups, mashed potatoes, and pudding.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of fluids as well. Try fruit juices, milkshakes, and egg nog. Drink them without a straw.<br>  <br>  Avoid foods with small grains or particles like rice, popcorn, pizza and hamburger. Small food particles can get trapped in your extraction site and cause infection.<br>  <br>  Oral Hygiene<br>  <br>  The day after surgery use warm salt water rinses (1/2 teaspoon table salt to an 8 ounce glass of warm water) several times a day. Always rinse after meals. This will speed healing by keeping your wound clean. Start brushing and flossing your teeth 24 hours after surgery. Be careful to avoid your extraction site.<br>  <br>  Other Conditions<br>  <br>  Discoloration - Some oozing of blood into tissue spaces may occur causing the skin to be black, blue, or yellow. Like any bruise this will begin to recede in a few days. <br>  Muscle Tightness - Tightness of the muscles may cause difficulty in opening the mouth. <br>  Related Pain - You may have a slight earache or a sore throat may develop. You may have numbness. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dental.washington.edu/departments/oralsurgery/patient_info.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dental.washington.edu/departm...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oral Surgery<br>  Bleeding: Is to be expected following extractions and other surgical procedures. This can last anywhere from 1-6 hours. If excessive bleeding occurs (Do as follows) <br>  Wipe off excessively large blood clots with sterile gauze. <br>  Bite firmly on gauze and maintain gentle pressure for 1 hour. <br>  Place folded gauze over the bleeding area. <br>  If bleeding has not subsided, use fresh gauze or tea bags for an additional hour. Repeat as needed every hour. <br>  Contact this office if excessive bleeding persists beyond six hours. <br>  Pain: Some discomfort is normal following surgery. 2 Aspirin or Tylenol every 3 hours usually relieves minor discomfort. If pain medication is prescribed take as directed. Don’t drive, operate machinery or drink alcoholic beverages (For at least six hours after taking medication). If you have any reaction to the medication, stop the medication and call the office. Dizziness and sedation is normal with narcotic pain medication. <br>  Antibiotics: If antibiotics are prescribed, take as directed. Be sure to take all tablets prescribed. If any reactions occur such as a rash or itching, discontinue and call the office immediately. (Today) <br>  Swelling: Following surgery some swelling is expected. It will reach its peak on the second day following the surgery. To minimize swelling start applying ice packs to your face for 20 minutes intervals. Remove for 10 minutes and then repeat. Continue ice packs for 4-8 hours after surgery. (Today and Tomorrow) <br>  Rinsing, Spitting, Brushing: Do not rinse, spit, brush or use mouthwash today. Tomorrow use a warm, saltwater solution 4-5 times a day for 1 week. In the morning, after meals and before bed. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sachemdental.com/services/surgery.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.sachemdental.com/services/sur...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Temperature: Following surgery it is quite common to have a slight elevation in temperature. Rest and take Aspirin, Tylenol or Advil and drink plenty of fluids to help return temperature to normal. If you are taking pain medication, they will also aid in controlling fever and additional medication for fever will not necessary. <br>  Eating: A well balanced diet is important for proper healing. A soft bland diet is suggested for the first few days. Drink plenty of fluids as soon as possible. Avoid hot foods and hot liquids (As they will promote bleeding). No sipping through straws and avoid smoking for 24 hours. A soft non-chewing diet is especially recommended following removal of impacted teeth. <br>  Impacted Teeth: The removal of impacted teeth is quite different from the extraction of erupted teeth. The following conditions may occur. All of which are considered “Normal” <br>  Swelling and bruising can be expected. Minimize by using ice packs the day of surgery. <br>  Moderate to severe pain can be expected. Don’t wait until pain is severe to take medication. Have the prescription filled and take the first dose at once. <br>  Trismus (tightening) of the muscles may cause difficulty in opening the mouth. Moist heat applied to the area may help. <br>  A sore throat may develop. This is normal. <br>  The corners of your mouth may dry and crack.

vSkqJ813aa	'In 1948 the Russian-American physicist George Gamow modified Lema?tre's [1931] theory of the primaeval atom. Gamow proposed that the universe was created in a gigantic explosion and that the various elements observed today were produced within the first few minutes after the big bang, when the extremely high temperature and density of the universe would fuse subatomic particles into the chemical elements. (Encarta)' Wikipedia comments that, '... Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the phrase "Big Bang" during a 1949 radio broadcast, as a derisive reference to a theory he did not subscribe to. ...' <br>  <br>  The time line of the Big Bang expansion of the universe is as follows. '... 'Extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past. This singularity signals the breakdown of general relativity. How closely we can extrapolate towards the singularity is debated—certainly not earlier than the Planck epoch. The early hot, dense phase is itself referred to as "the Big Bang", and is considered the "birth" of our universe. Based on measurements of the expansion using Type Ia supernovae, measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, and measurements of the correlation function of galaxies, the universe has a calculated age of 13.73 ± 0.12 billion years. The agreement of these three independent measurements strongly supports the ΛCDM model that describes in detail the contents of the universe.<br>  <br>  The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models, the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with an incredibly high energy density, huge temperatures and pressures, and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10^?37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation[first proposed in 1980 by Alan Guth], during which the universe grew exponentially. After inflation stopped, the universe consisted of a quark-gluon plasma, as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle-antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and anti-leptons—of the order of 1 part in 30 million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.<br>  <br>  The universe continued to grow in size and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10^?11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle physics experiments. At about 10^?6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton-antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons-antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10^10 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons (with a minor contribution from neutrinos).<br>  <br>  A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion Kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei. As the universe cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon radiation. After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation.<br>  <br>   <br>  Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe. The three possible types of matter are known as cold dark matter, hot dark matter and baryonic matter. The best measurements available (from WMAP) show that the dominant form of matter in the universe is cold dark matter. The other two types of matter make up less than 18% of the matter in the universe.<br>  <br>  Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB imply the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 72% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity had the upper hand, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the expansion of the universe to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the cosmological constant term in Einstein's field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.<br>  <br>  All of this cosmic evolution after the inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modelled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. As noted above, there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10^?15 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of quantum gravitation is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics. ...(Wikipedia)'.|`|bXSYSEAcaa	there will be those who can answer that alot more detailed than me but i think that Scientists believe the universe was once the size of a pea which exploded with great power.

There is no ways someone can give you a concise version of all the theories available to us at this moment.<br>  <br>  There are many books written on this topic by notable physicists, including Steven Hawkins.  I suggest you read one or few of them.<br>  <br>  The point of big bang is thought to be an infinitely small and infinitely dense point.  Exactly as to what was in it is still up for debate.  Our current theory can only take us up to billionth of second or so AFTER the actual Bang.  <br>  <br>  One thing I can tell you is that thinking of BEFORE the big ban is an useless proposition.  Since the Big Bang is a beginning of our universe, what was there before is outside of our universe.  Also, since the time as we perceive it today did not exist then, what happened before has no relevance to what we have today.  Many books on the theory will explain this to you much better than I can.

The only way continuity can be maintained is if the wave oscillates at the same rhythm on both sides of the boundary.  Hence the frequency remains the same.  However the speed of propagation will change and hence, because speed = frequency x wavelength, the wavelength must also change as is crosses the boundary.

7kMeaccWaa	no, silly.<br>  <br>  Competition with early avian dinosaur species may have resulted in the extinction of many of the pterosaurs.[citation needed] By the end of the Cretaceous, only large species of pterosaurs are known. The smaller species seem to have become extinct, their niche filled by birds,[28] though a lack of small pterosaurs in the fossil record could also be a result of poor preservation due to the fragility of their skeletons.[citation needed] At the end of the Cretaceous period, the great extinction which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs plus most avian dinosaurs as well, and many other animals, seemed to also take the pterosaurs. Alternatively, most pterosaurs may have been specialised for an ocean-going lifestyle.[citation needed] Consequently, when the K-T mass-extinction severely affected marine life that most pterosaurs fed on, they went extinct.<br>  <br>  Living pterosaur hoax<br>  It was reported in an article in The Illustrated London News (February 9, 1856, page 166) that, in 1856, workmen laboring in a tunnel for a railway line, between Saint-Dizier and Nancy, in France, were cutting through Jurassic limestone when a large creature stumbled out from inside it. It fluttered its wings, made a croaking noise and dropped dead. According to the workers, the creature had a 10-foot (3.0 m) wingspan, four legs joined by a membrane, black leathery skin, talons for feet and a toothed mouth. A local student of paleontology identified the animal as a pterodactyl. The report had the animal turn to dust, as soon as it had died.<br>  <br>  This incredible hoax was stimulated in part by contemporary Franco-Prussian palaeontological rivalry. The Solnhofen limestone from Bavaria (in which Archaeopteryx would later be discovered) was producing many prized fossils, each of which was proudly announced by German paleontologists. The tunnel in question was through limestone of similar age to the Solnhofen Limestone, so it presented an opportunity for a shocking story.|`|AA11058044	There has been a photo floating around for some time, purporting to show a bunch of hunters and the pterosaur they shot down.<br>  <br>  However, the photo was actually created in conjunction with the Fox TV series "Freakylinks", which was on several years ago (and was actually pretty good - so naturally Fox cancelled it before anyone heard of it).<br>  <br>  I've since seen it on several cryptozoology sites, credited as a real photo.|`|VFcDbeyoaa	Take a step back and ask yourself:<br>  <br>  Are dinosaurs really alive today? <br>  <br>  If they were, wouldn't the scientific community be in an uproar?

nKCMRLysaa	In the UK, queen wasps hibernate through the winter and then start a new nest in spring. It probably came into your house in autumn and spent the winter hiding somewhere in your room. <br>  <br>  The temperature has been above average in the UK recently so it has probably come out of hibernation early. If the weather turns cold again, it probably won't survive.<br>  <br>  A wasp once spent the winter in my car. In October the car was parked with the window open, when a wasp flew in and crawled straight into one of the air holes in the ventilation system and disappeared. Strangely, I was parked in almost the exact same place one day next spring, when the wasp came out of the hole and flew out of the window! I wondered if it knew somehow that it was "back home" at the same place, or that it had traveled several thousand miles around the UK while it was hibernating.|`|C71TluSkaa	Lol, I have a wasp nest under my outdoor stairs.

F5fMcdg3aa	Deposition is the process of converting from a gas to a solid.  You can think of it like the gas "depositing" the solid.  Since the gaseous form of a substance has more energy than the solid form, the process of deposition releases energy.  An example of this process is frost forming on the ground, in which case water vapor in the air is converted to water in its solid form: ice.

UFteXlqwaa	I am not sure what your question is but the assessment that airplane cabins are pressurized is only partly true. In an airliner at cruise level, the cabin pressure correspond to roughly 6,000 ft above sea level. That correspond to about 800 hPa (the average sea level pressure is 1,023.25 hPa or 29.9 Hg In).<br>  <br>  When you fly an airliner, or when I fly my own light aircraft, the difference of pressure is very much felt in the ear drums.<br>  <br>  The highest I have been with my own unpressurized aircraft if 10,000 ft.

AA11371742	Even without a surface, you could still have fun in Neptune.  For instance, the wind speeds in neptune can reach up to 1500 miles per hour (2.5 miles every second, in essence).  This would make for some great high speed ship racing.  The distance from Neptune to the Kuiper belt isnt very far.  Infact, Pluto, for a breif amount of time, sometimes becomes the 8th planet while Neptune becomes the 9th planet.  As such, it brings us possibilities that if you can get to Neptune that fast, you could also swing by any on-coming comets or Kuiper belt objects and get a sample of it as a suivenier for home- maybe even use it to prove Pluto IS a planet!

5682081015967f42594884ec81b2d107aa	Soaps are neutralized fatty acids, with a little oil thrown in to make it less harsh on the skin. Addition of vinegar introduces acetic acid, which can regenerate some of the fatty acid from its salt form, reducing its "surfactant" capacity. In other words, the soap won't work as well for cleaning.<br>  <br>  Lotions are emulsions of oils suspended in water, just like mayonnaise. What keeps the lotion in the emulsion state are surfactant molecules. If the lotion is stabilized with soap, the emulsion may separate into oil and water layers. However, most lotions are stabilized with non-soap type surfactants which are inert towards acid, so it is more than likely that nothing will happen  when vinegar is added, other than your hands smelling like Italian dressing. The lotions are buffered as well, meaning they resist the actions of added acids or bases.
X4EBNoNUaa	Kathy..easy there...vinegar is ~ 5% acetic acid ..not a problem for your skin....acetate can be metabolized by your body easily..so even if some got through your skin ...it would be buffered immediately and later metabolized..no worries. The scum can come about by the presense of certain alkaline metals like calcium that forms less soluble salts than the sodium or potassium forms of the soap. The acetic acid solubilizes the salts better than water. There is no danger from your little vinegar trip..

All modern HGVs used in Europe must meet Euro legislation and this demands use of modern, electronically controlled, common rail diesel injection systems to keep polluting emissions low.  These fuel injection systems are more efficient than the old fashioned mechanical injection systems.<br>  <br>  Truck manufacturers are also using high strength steels and composite materials to construct the vehicles and their components and these keep the overall weight down.

Meaning they won't send someone in the bathroom with you to watch you pee (at least I have never seen or even heard of them doing this). You haven't been charged with a crime and have rights. The best thing to do is have someone else who has a clean urine pee for you. Heat it up in the microwave for 5-10 second intervales and test it with a termometer until it gets to around 100 degrees (I know its high, but you have to allow for cooling). Place the urine in a small sealed container, wrap it in foil and then duck tape it to your inner thigh. The rest is obvious. Just don't leave any evidence lying around.

Unfortunately erectile dysfunction is a very real side effect of such a radical surgery. But men can get real and very discrete solutions with online prescriptions such as Viagra.   More than half a million Americans will die of cancer this year, and in men, prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of death. Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in America, affecting about 16 percent of men. According to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, more than 186,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008, and more than 28,000 men will die from the disease. A new case occurs every two-and-a-half minutes, and a man dies from prostate cancer every 19 minutes.<br>   <br>   When it's caught early, prostate cancer can be stopped in a majority of men. But this disease, not to mention its treatment, can have a profound effect on a man's ability to perform sexually.<br>   <br>   <br>   Duration of erectile dysfunction following surgery<br>   <br>   If a man requires prostate surgery, or radical prostatectomy, for prostate cancer, his life, especially his sex life, may be changed forever. It is important to remember that surgery of any kind is a traumatic procedure and it takes time for the body to heal and recover. In the event of this type of surgery, the ability to achieve an erection will also take time, but many men will see an improvement in their erections over time, especially men who had no difficulty achieving a good erection before the surgery.<br>   <br>   In the first three months to a year following radical prostatectomy, most men will not be able to achieve a spontaneous erection, and will probably require an erectile dysfunction medication that can be bought through an online pharmacy, such as  Viagra,  to attain an erection.<br>   <br>   Radiation therapy<br>   <br>   Unlike radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, radiation therapy may cause problems slowly and over time. The main cause of erectile dysfunction following radiation is damage to the blood vessels supplying the nerves responsible for erections.<br>   <br>   Cryosurgery<br>   <br>   Cryosurgery, or the technique of using extreme cold to treat tumors in cancer, can have permanent negative effects. When the prostate gland is frozen the nerve bundles controlling erections can often be permanently damaged.<br>   <br>   Treating erectile dysfunction after prostate cancer treatment<br>   <br>   Viagra is an oral erectile dysfunction medication that works by promoting increased blood flow to produce an erection when the penis is manually stimulated, and can be obtained through a reputable online pharmacy. Viagra does not improve sex drive, only erections. Studies have shown that men with erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy respond well to Viagra if the nerve bundles on both sides of the prostate are intact. But Viagra is normally not effective if one or both nerve bundles have been damaged.<br>   <br>   Other possible solutions to helping a man regain his facility to produce an erection after prostate treatment include penile medication injections, use of a vacuum constriction or vacuum erection device (which is very costly), or a penile implant, a prosthetic device surgically implanted inside the penis.<br>   <br>   The bottom line is that a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer is recommended annually for men over 50, or even earlier for men with a family history of prostate cancer. Without our health we've got nothing, and nothing makes a man feel like less of a man than the inability to perform.

1hciyvKdaa	Those styro cups, try cutting out the bottom, then slit down the side and then use as many as you can to encompass the inners of that box or what you put inside. Foil (shiny side to the outside for reflection) is another thing you can use, and line that with plastic to keep leaks from coming out. Make popcorn if you have it and crush it up to go along with the styro,  Newspaper layers also is very temperature containing. Dry ice is sold in newspaper usually, Using egg cartons for the cardboard also or any cardboard, bend it up alot so you can bend it, if its pieces from a box. Corn cobs were used too, as well as feathers. Put the foil and the outside, line with thick newpaper, other material and now repeat the newpaper and foil again. That should do the trick ok.

He read about the fact that identical fossils, of land creatures and plants, occurred on these two continents and also on the Indian sub-continent and Australia:  He theorised that this could only be possible if the landmasses had been part of one supercontinent. He also noted that plants with tropical affinities were found in Arctic islands.  He also matched up large scale geological features on the continents. He observed that the fossil assemblages began to diverge about 200 million years ago, so thought the continents began to drift apart at that time.

AA10335036	I'd think it's a matter of matching the ear aperture. If you allow the sound to expand into a tube of much greater inside diameter than the ear canal, the arriving sound intensity (i.e., power/area) will be less. Sound energy will be wasted flexing the walls instead of being directed into the ear.

AA11177338	Hello:<br>  <br>  Here are the twelve principles of green chemistry, this may help you to get an idea.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would write about biofuels, such as biodiesel or bioetanol.<br>  <br>  Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry<br>  <br>  <br>  1.-Prevent waste: Design chemical syntheses to prevent waste, leaving no waste to treat or clean up. <br>  2.-Design safer chemicals and products: Design chemical products to be fully effective, yet have little or no toxicity. <br>  3.-Design less hazardous chemical syntheses: Design syntheses to use and generate substances with little or no toxicity to humans and the environment. <br>  4.-Use renewable feedstocks: Use raw materials and feedstocks that are renewable rather than depleting. Renewable feedstocks are often made from agricultural products or are the wastes of other processes; depleting feedstocks are made from fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, or coal) or are mined. <br>  5.-Use catalysts, not stoichiometric reagents: Minimize waste by using catalytic reactions. Catalysts are used in small amounts and can carry out a single reaction many times. They are preferable to stoichiometric reagents, which are used in excess and work only once. <br>  6.-Avoid chemical derivatives: Avoid using blocking or protecting groups or any temporary modifications if possible. Derivatives use additional reagents and generate waste. <br>  7.-Maximize atom economy: Design syntheses so that the final product contains the maximum proportion of the starting materials. There should be few, if any, wasted atoms. <br>  8.-Use safer solvents and reaction conditions: Avoid using solvents, separation agents, or other auxiliary chemicals. If these chemicals are necessary, use innocuous chemicals. <br>  9.-Increase energy efficiency: Run chemical reactions at ambient temperature and pressure whenever possible. <br>  10.-Design chemicals and products to degrade after use: Design chemical products to break down to innocuous substances after use so that they do not accumulate in the environment. <br>  11.-Analyze in real time to prevent pollution: Include in-process real-time monitoring and control during syntheses to minimize or eliminate the formation of byproducts. <br>  12.-Minimize the potential for accidents: Design chemicals and their forms (solid, liquid, or gas) to minimize the potential for chemical accidents including explosions, fires, and releases to the environment.<br>  <br>  Regards

Bush the Younger has had a bit more success motivating a return to the Moon, but now even that is in jeopardy as the nation faces an economic crisis.<br>  <br>  But the short answer is that NASA hasn't continued exploring the Moon because there is a lack of interest on the part of the people holding the money.|`|Aty76cgqaa	This is a FAQ<br>  <br>  The goal of landing a man on the Moon was a scientific achievement accomplished.

YX4y4vCfaa	There are many factors to consider. Pressure, relative humidity, fronts, etc... Fronts and the pressure gradient are the most important.<br>  <br>  Interesting fact:<br>  Did you know that the very first weather forecast ever made was during WWII for D-Day. Meteorologists that really had no idea what they were doing at the time because nobody Had done this before thought that weather would be optimal either at that time or about a week or so later. They came to the conclusion that they should strike on D-Day of course. If they would have waited for the other date they would have been faced with one of the greatest storms recorded in the English channel and since D-Day was so important to victory we may have lost the war.<br>  <br>  So the next time you hear someone rag on a meteorologist, make sure they know that without their research we might all be wearing swastikas right now. That is of course if Hitler accepted us as being good enough to evade the gas chamber.|`|UFteXlqwaa	Trying to predict the weather for the days to come from the present weather maps is fun, Josh! Amateur meteorology is something anyone can do, is very cheap, and each new day is a new challenge!<br>  <br>  What I like to do first is to look at the weather aloft. Usually at 500 hPa, which is half way through the tropopause. Why? because there, the big picture is not influenced by the ground. You can clearly see e.g. the difference of temperature that marks the polar front.<br>  <br>  Then, of course, you look where low and high pressures are. Unless you live terribly south, you're probably under the influence of the westerlies and you can expect the weather to move east.<br>  <br>  But not always! That's why it is very interesting to follow the weather maps from day to day, to see the general motion.<br>  <br>  Low pressures bring wind and precipitations. High pressure bring clear weather and sunshine. But that is not always a warmer day. If you are far enough north in the winter, you loose more heat during the night, than the sun can bring during the day! And it can get very cold under a high pressure; remember that both poles are regions of high pressures!<br>  <br>  Watching the wind aloft and especially the jet streams is very interesting because it will tell you how fast the weather will move. Note that when meteorologist are not very correct, it is now about what will happen but when. That's because it is always difficult to predict how fast a low pressure will move and if it is deepening or filling up. But if there is a lot of rain and the wind is blowing from there, ... you'll get it sooner or later. <br>  <br>  Look at the isobars. Around a low, in the northern hemisphere, the wind follows them counter-clockwise, and clockwise around a high pressure. But that's aloft. Near the ground, drag will make the wind to move more toward the center of the low pressure.<br>  <br>  ... okay, I could write for hours here. Just have fun, my friend! :-)|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	there are different colors on the map which indicate that there is a lot of moisture or precipitation going on there<br>  <br>  they can also tell storms by the way the clouds are formed.<br>  <br>  for example, a hurricane is spinning around the center and is huge so it would be pretty easy to predict that a hurricane is starting up|`|Yc3XR6Thaa	The meeting of high pressure systems and low pressure systems can cause weather 'events', like rain or thunderstorms.

The thought behind this, vs. a big lump check, is that people will use the extra money to maybe take their family out to eat. (this is an example)  That restaurant then sees more business, needs to hire more people to help out, the restaurant then also needs more supplies, buys more from the suppliers, which creates more jobs, as they need to hire more people to keep up, more truck drivers are hired to deliver the goods, and so on and so on.  With the big lump sum, you are more likely to just make 1 larger purchase, such as a new tv or a trip, which doesn't help our economy in the long run.<br>  <br>  If you have heard the H&R Block ads, it talks about people being owed stimulus money.  If for some reason you did not receive the full amount of the Stimulus check for 2008, you may be able to get the difference back on your tax return, but honestly, I don't know anyone that didn't get the full amount.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA12060117	Nope.

AA11058044	Why is it necessarily at the "expense" of business or business development?<br>  <br>  Most economic models seem to consider that nothing on Earth has any value unless it can be converted into a yearly monetary profit for the shareholders.<br>  <br>  As long as our economic models remain beholden to the shareholders, rather than overall public good, our planet will continue to spiral down into ecological, and eventually civil and economic ruin.<br>  <br>  In addition, there is the ongoing problem of counting undeveloped natural resources as worthless, and only assigning them economic value when they are utilized and sold.  This is purely due to short-sighted accountancy, and doesn't even make sense economically.  Forests that haven't been cut down yet should not be considered protected at the "expense" of businees - they should be considered an asset - a tangible asset that appreciates in value from year to year no less!<br>  <br>  Likewise, other natural or energy resources that are not being exploited shouldn't be considered a loss from that quarter's revenue stream, they should be considered long-term tangible assets - ones that should only be exploited when the highest profit per unit of production is available.  It's not like oil's going to go bad if you leave it in the ground for a few years.  I consider many of the current oil industry practices to be not only bad for the environment, but also damaging long-term to their shareholders - something their shareholders should be calling them on.<br>  <br>  In terms of spotted owl habitat - by not utilizing that resource, the resource becomes more valuable every year, simply because the resource of old growth forest becomes rarer and rarer every year.  The longer a company keeps from logging it, the more it will be worth.  Actually logging the habitat would be a short term gain, but it would take hundreds of years to regenerate that same worth - and the regeneration may not even be possible if some of the species go extinct.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, there are other economic possibilities for the habitat - including eco-tourism (quickly outstripping forestry as an income source in many Central American, Asian and African countries) - which is a non-destructive use of the habitat while the tangible asset continues to appreciate.<br>  <br>  Far from being at the "expense" of business, not protecting endangered species can be seen to be a major expense not just to business, but to society as a whole.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	which is more important?<br>  <br>  <br>  the expense of the business of which only a handful of people partake?<br>  <br>  or the expense of the planet, to which we all answer?<br>  <br>  the world isn't a caste.. you cant buy yourself more biodeversity, better ozone, cleaner air, stability.... you have to WORK for it<br>  <br>  <br>  there are lucrative business enterprises that don't involve ecological devastation... so the entire arguement is moot<br>  <br>  <br>  see hayzoos's answer for more<br>  <br>  <br>  it's not at my exspense to put money into the stock market (not the current one though, lol)<br>  <br>  you expect returns equal to or greater than what was payed... the same in true for investing in the planet|`|HEDSOHq1aa	money is an imaginary thing, while the planet and extinctions are not|`|qaiYanF2aa	Economically, it probably is not good that they are protected -in some instances- at the expense of business or industry.<br>  <br>  The Spotted Owl controversy brought Washington and much of Oregon's highly productive timber business --which then affected their sawmills and furniture factories etc---  to it's knees.  However, I have noticed that the supposedly endangered species has now been found in other places and thriving.  ??  They sure got a lot of good publicity out of it though, didn't they?<br>  <br>  The gray wolf - well, my grandpa was a big rancher and he poisoned wolves and coyotes at the site of every kill.  The killed both sheep and lambs and many newborn calves - quite often badly injuring the cow in the process - if not killing her too.  <br>  <br>  I think we need to be practical and consider the greater good overall.  There have been so many species that have gone extinct and others established in the history of the world.  Who is to say that is not nature's way of weeding out the weak or the ones that aren't 'doing' their job??  <br>  <br>  I don't think the animal protection people know as much as they think they do either.  I think that many times (as in the case of the Spotted Owl) they were mistaken at great expense to many, many people's lives.  <br>  <br>  I do believe that we need to take care in what we are doing.  We do not need to pave over or build a house on every acre of land that is out there.  However, it is important to keep humanity in mind.  Sometimes I think the 'green' people want people to become extinct and let the Earth be pristine again.  I don't think that is practical and it certainly is not cost effective.<br>  <br>  Of course, after much research, I do not believe in global warming either.
Aty76cgqaa	Gravity is one of the four basic fundamental forces of the physical Universe (nature).<br>  <br>  1) The strong interaction force is very strong, but very short-ranged. It acts only over ranges of order 10-13 centimeters and is responsible for holding the nuclei of atoms together. It is basically attractive, but can be effectively repulsive in some circumstances. <br>  <br>  2) The electromagnetic force causes electric and magnetic effects such as the repulsion between like electrical charges or the interaction of bar magnets. It is long-ranged, but much weaker than the strong force. It can be attractive or repulsive, and acts only between pieces of matter carrying electrical charge. <br>  <br>  3) The weak force is responsible for radioactive decay and neutrino interactions. It has a very short range and, as its name indicates, it is very weak. <br>  <br>  4) The gravitational force is weak, but very long ranged. Furthermore, it is always attractive, and acts between any two pieces of matter in the Universe since mass is its source. <br>  <br>  Before the Big Bang, all four forces were united as one in the singularity of heat and pressure. Following the Big Bang expansion, gravity was the first force to seperate from the other three.|`|AA11564934	DOn't know why Chrislon got thumbs down, it was an excellent answer.|`|iN91UZvdaa	One could say it started with the big bang, but the simple truth is that gravity is not a force on its own. Gravity is basically a curve in space time created by mass, the larger mass is the stronger its gravity is. The strongest gravity based object is a black hole with a infinite curve in space time which pretty much stretches and atomizes anything it grabs hold of into its base particles. So when you look at it from this angle, gravity does not really exist unless mass exists and since nothing existed before the big bang the universe was basically a verse absent of everything we have today, including gravity and mass. <br>  <br>  I hope this was useful.|`|TItRpckpaa	There's two schools of thought, one is that theres the gravitron which is one of the forces (I think 4) that hold mass together. <br>  <br>  The one I understadn more is that objects with mass bend space-time.<br>  <br>  For example: Imagine placing a bowling ball on your bed's mattress, it creates a dent in it, and if you put something with mass (like a marble) in the part that indents it will roll towards the bowling ball.

cQpmQ4p4aa	4G features:<br>  <br>  According to the 4G working groups, the infrastructure and the terminals of 4G will have almost all the standards from 2G to 4G implemented. Although legacy systems are in place to adopt existing users, the infrastructure for 4G will be only packet-based (all-IP). Some proposals suggest having an open internet platform. Technologies considered to be early 4G include Flash-OFDM, the 802.16e mobile version of WiMax (also known as WiBro in South Korea), and HC-SDMA (see iBurst). 3GPP Long Term Evolution may reach the market 1-2 years after Mobile WiMax.<br>  <br>  An even higher speed version of WiMax is the IEEE 802.16m specification. LTE Advanced will be the later evolution of the 3GPP LTE standard. <br>       <br>  Components<br>  <br>   Access schemes<br>  <br>  As the wireless standards evolved, the access techniques used also exhibited increase in efficiency, capacity and scalability. The first generation wireless standards used plain TDMA and FDMA. In the wireless channels, TDMA proved to be less efficient in handling the high data rate channels as it requires large guard periods to alleviate the multipath impact. Similarly, FDMA consumed more bandwidth for guard to avoid inter carrier interference. So in second generation systems, one set of standard used the combination of FDMA and TDMA and the other set introduced a new access scheme called CDMA. Usage of CDMA increased the system capacity and also placed a soft limit on it rather than the hard limit. Data rate is also increased as this access scheme is efficient enough to handle the multipath channel. This enabled the third generation systems to used CDMA as the access scheme IS-2000, UMTS, HSXPA, 1xEV-DO, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA. The only issue with CDMA is that it suffers from poor spectrum flexibility and scalability.<br>  <br>  Recently, new access schemes like Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), Single Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), Interleaved FDMA and Multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) are gaining more importance for the next generation systems. WiMax is using OFDMA in the downlink and in the uplink. For the next generation UMTS, OFDMA is being considered for the downlink. By contrast, IFDMA is being considered for the uplink since OFDMA contributes more to the PAPR related issues and results in nonlinear operation of amplifiers. IFDMA provides less power fluctuation and thus avoids amplifier issues. Similarly, MC-CDMA is in the proposal for the IEEE 802.20 standard. These access schemes offer the same efficiencies as older technologies like CDMA. Apart from this, scalability and higher data rates can be achieved.<br>  <br>  The other important advantage of the above mentioned access techniques is that they require less complexity for equalization at the receiver. This is an added advantage especially in the MIMO environments since the spatial multiplexing transmission of MIMO systems inherently requires high complexity equalization at the receiver.<br>  <br>  In addition to improvements in these multiplexing systems, improved modulation techniques are being used. Whereas earlier standards largely used Phase-shift keying, more efficient systems such as 64QAM are being proposed for use with the 3GPP Long Term Evolution standards.<br>  <br>  Applications<br>  <br>  At the present rates of 15-30 Mbit/s, 4G is capable of providing users with streaming high-definition television. At rates of 100 Mbit/s, the content of a DVD-5 (for example a movie), can be downloaded within about 5 minutes for offline access<br>  <br>  4G wireless standards<br>  <br>  3GPP is currently standardizing LTE Advanced as future 4G standard. A first set of 3GPP requiremens on LTE Advanced has been approved in June 2008[15]. The working groups are currently evaluating various proposals for standardization. LTE Advanced will be standardized as part of the Release 10 of the 3GPP specification

oWbUA0UMaa	It is indeed a very important part of genetics. It is a direct contribution to variety in sexual reproduction. As you might already know, many organisms, human, plants, have 2 complete set of chromosomes, one set from father, and the other from mother. When meiosis take place, the 2 sets of chromosomes are mixed together, and randomly reassembled to form a new complete set. So say human have 46 chromosomes, 23 from father, and 23 from mother, The 23 you get from your father, may have 10 from his father, and 13 from his mother, or any number of combination. So any given individual will resemble some characteristics from his parents, but do not have the exact face/height/body type of neither parent. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps! :)|`|FnsptPjhaa	Meiosis is related to genetics in so many ways, you can go look on google about its process, it basically is the reproduction of sex cells and only those cells in an organism.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Although there are an estimated 200 - 400 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, I doubt that 1/4 to 1/2 of them would have an Earth-like planet.  I would take the following to indicate that only about 15% of the stars in the galaxy would be likely to have the potential for planets that could support life.  That would be a potential for 30 - 60 billion planets that might support life.  Considering the binary and multiple star systems included in the 15% would likely reduce that number.  Although Alan Boss, the astronomer quoted at your link, said there may be 100 billion, the numbers seem to fall short of that.  There is currently no proof, however, so it is all speculation.<br>  <br>  About the Drake Equation<br>  "Percent of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy that are appropriate for life:<br>  <br>  We don't know what is actually required to make a star appropriate, but many scientists believe that a star has to be a Main Sequence star in order to be appropriate. (Main Sequence stars are stars whose luminosity is directly related to their temperature.) Other scientists believe that a star has to be very much like the Sun, which is a Main Sequence star and more specifically a G-type star. Only about 5% of the stars in our galaxy are G-type stars, though about 10% more are F- and K-type stars-the types of stars closest to G-type (Sunlike) and about 90% of stars are Main Sequence stars. Also, about half of stars exist in binary or multiple systems, which may make those stars inappropriate."|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	Define "Earth-like" then we'll start guessing.  I'd define  "Earth-like" as having similar gravity and temperature axial rotation say 18 to 36 hours, a star like our Sun  AND a large moon.  <br>  <br>  There are probably plenty of planets which similar gravity and temperature range, even with similar rotation and a similar star.  It is the Moon which makes the Earth livable over long periods as it stabilizes the orbit round the Sun..|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	No.<br>  Most definitely not.<br>  There's 100 billion stars in our galaxy, but not every one of these will have a "habitable" zone. Consider variable stars which swell and contract (some as much as 30%). Also we must consider other factors of stars- some regularly have enormous coronal mass ejections that would certainly strip any planet of all its left should it get hit. (Were talking enormous here- not like the little burps and farts of our pathetic, wimpy sun).<br>  <br>  Also consider that throughout our galaxy there are stars in virtually every stage of their lifecycles. A "brand new" star will not have any planets in its orbit old enough for life to evolve. Ancient stars such as white dwarves would have wiped out any terrestrial life prior to their collapse.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Personally I consider that a fairly significant overestimation. There are only about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way, of which about 200 billion are red dwarfs and at best perhaps 30% of the remainder are similar to the Sun in their mass and luminosity. However, most of these are in multiple star systems, leaving us with more like 20 billion solitary sunlike stars in our galaxy as the best upper limit. I would be surprised if as many as one in five had a terrestrial-type planet with a circular orbit inside the habitable zone, so my guess would be that three billion earthlike planets in the Milky Way is probably the best we can do.<br>  <br>  That said, I don't think earthlike planets are the only places where life could develop. Although I suspect that most of the earthlike planets do not have life forms of their own, it is quite conceivable that life forms may develop on gas giant moons (like Europa), in the atmospheres of gas giants, deep under the crusts of cold planets, or even inside comets, and this is even if we assume that carbon/water life is the only kind of life that can reasonably arise naturally in our universe.|`|W2suykEtaa	i am guessing misquote.<br>  <br>  otherwise this guy "Hi, I'm not an astronomer, but I play one on TV" is just plain nuts.<br>  <br>  I saw a squirrel, therefore I deduce that there are nut trees in every yard of every house in my town.<br>  <br>  yeah...  it doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  deduction is useful, but every time one of these grade school Sherlocks open their mouths, I cringe.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	I hope so.|`|sJegUB11aa	There's at least 200 billion stars in our galaxy.<br>  I think that 100 billion Earth-like planets is a bit much though.<br>  It's not so hard to imagine our solar system with no Earth; just Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc.  There could be millions of solar systems like that.  On the other hand, our sun is not a big star and there are millions much larger, so it's possible for some solar systems to have 2 or 3 vaguely Earthlike planets in different orbits.  The problem here is that big stars tend to have short lives, so any life on such planets might not get much beyond the sponge stage before BOOM !<br>  <br>  There are millions of older stars that probably only have gas planets because there wasn't as many heavier elements than hydrogen and helium billions of years ago when they were born.<br>  <br>  It is however, interesting to see that concepts in the Drake Equation of how many intelligent species there might be in the galaxy are being adjusted because of the finds of lots of planets in recent years.|`|AA10929465	"In a paper published recently in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the researchers concluded that based on what they saw, at least 361 intelligent civilizations have emerged in the Milky Way since its creation, and as many as 38,000 may have formed."<br>  <br>  That sounds like a more believable number.|`|3YydMgt0aa	I agree, I don't think that there are that many and also there may be life in our galaxy other than ourselves.

uCCxbXJjaa	how am i supposedd to know . =)|`|x384qQ3Iaa	Let s1 be the number of gallons of the 12% solution you need, and let s2 be the number of gallons of the 20% solution you need.  Since you know the final total gallons is 100, then you know that s1 + s2 = 100. <br>  <br>  When it comes to the acid content, you can say that .12*s1 is the acid in the first solution, and .20*s2 is the acid in the second solution. Finally, you know these have to add up to 18% of 100 gallons, so 18 = .12*s1 + .20*s2.  <br>  <br>  Solve the first equation for s1 and you get s1 = 100 - s2.  Substitute this equation for s1 into the second equation to get: 0.12*(100 - s2) + 0.20*s2 = 18.   Now all you have to do is solve for s2; here's what I did:<br>  <br>  0.12*(100 - s2) + 0.20*s2 = 18<br>  12 - 0.12*s2 + 0.20*s2 = 18<br>  0.08*s2 = 6<br>  s2 = 6/0.08 = 75 gallons.<br>  <br>  Since s1 = 100 - s2, s1 must be 25 gallons. So thats it!|`|gTDzR23jaa	Okay:<br>  <br>  Well, 18% equals 0.18, and 12% equals 0.12, and 20%=0.2<br>  100(0.18) = 0.12(x) + 0.20(y), and<br>  100=x+y<br>  Where x is the amount of the first solution, and y is the amount of the second solution.  This is because 18% of 100 is how much acid is in the 100 gallons.<br>  18=0.12(x) + 0.20(y)<br>  100=x+y<br>  So that means:<br>  100-18 = x+y - (0.12x + 0.20y)<br>  So, after simplifying, you get<br>  82 = 0.88(x)+0.8(y)

AA11508270	Use the Intermediate Value Theorem, that states:  If f(x) is continuous on an interval, say [a, b] , and    f(a) < c < f(b), there exists d in (a, b), such that f(d) = c.<br>  <br>  The Intermediate Value Theorem applies to your function.<br>  <br>  0 is between f(0) and f(1), and f(x) is continuous in [0, 1].  By the Intermediate Value Theorem there exists some c, such that f(c) = 0.<br>  <br>  You might think my reasoning is circular, but it really is not.  I can make a case that just stating the Intermediate Value Theorem answers your question.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT 1:  Here's a proof for IVT.  If you understand it, then the answer to your question is trivial.<br>  <br>  First look at the statement in the Intermediate Value Theorem writeup. Since we are going to use the fact that f is continuous at a point p in the proof twice let us restate the definition here.<br>  <br>  Given any e>0 there exists a d>0 such that |f(x)-f(p)|<e for all x such that |x-p|<d.<br>  <br>  Consider the set X={x in [a,b] : f(x)<=0}. Now X is nonempty (since a is in it) and b is an upper bound. Thus, if we define c=sup X then we know that c exists and is finite. So our aim is to prove that f(c)=0.<br>  <br>  Suppose that f(c) > 0. Continuity at c tells us that, given some e > 0 we have a d > 0 such that f(x) > f(c)-e for all x with x > c-d and x < c-d.<br>  <br>  There are two things to note, firstly we can choose e as small as we like, so f(x) > 0 in this range. Second, by the definition of c we have f(x) > 0, as soon as x > c. Thus, we have f(x) > 0 for all x with x > c-d. It follows that c is not the supremum after all, a contradiction.<br>  <br>  Likewise suppose that f(c) < 0. This time continuity tells us that for any e > 0 we can choose a d > 0 such that f(c+d) < f(c)+e. Choosing e small enough, we have f(c+d) < 0. This again contradicts the choice of c.<br>  <br>  Thus we have f(c)=0. Finally, c really is in the open interval since f(a) and f(b) are nonzero, by assumption.

In other words this is 100% of the weight.  So 1% of this would be 100th of the total weight.  To do this, we move the decimal point two places to the left.  So 1% of 3.6kg = 0.036kg.

H2 stays the same, NO concentration is doubled.  Rate increases by factor of 4, thus reaction is second order with respect to NO<br>  <br>  Rate is then written as:<br>  <br>  rate = k [H2] [NO]^2 which is answer 4.|`|b691c3ca62fd1d8844180c2c83daccbcaa	The usual way of dealing with this sort of information is to construct a graph that relates concentration of the constituents to the rate of  product formation. A linear relationship indicates a first-order raction with respect to a particular component when the plot is drawn on normal graph paper. If a linear relationship doesn't happen, then draw a second graph on log-log graph paper. A linear relationship there indicates a second-order reaction with respect to a particular component.<br>  It is also possible to determine the order by 'number crunching' the data obtained, substituting the experimental values for concentrations and rates into a rate expression to see if they 'work'. In this case, you have been given a number of choices for the rate expression. Can you decide which is the right answer by doing the math now?|`|LxYQccQ3aa	i agree, its 4

I am usually out by 93.<br>  When the surgery is over and you start coming off the anathesia it will be like waking from a really deep sleep.  They will keep an eye on you in recovery for a time and then you will either go home (day surgery) or to your assigned room.

It's not really like waking up from sleep, becuase I just felt completely relaxed coming out of the sedative.<br>  <br>  There was always a recovery room nurse flitting around and noticed that I was awake within seconds after *I* realized I was conscious.  Didn't really feel any post-surgery pain -- that came hours later after I was FULLY awake and the sedative was out of my system.<br>  <br>  So...

PsCCd63yaa	To reflect a line across the x axis, you write down the equation, just replacing every 'y' you see with "-y".  Don't touch the x!  So:<br>  <br>  K is 3x - 2y  = 6<br>  L is 3x - 2 * -y = 6<br>  3x + 2y = 6<br>  Or, in your form, 3x + 2y - 6 = 0.<br>  <br>  Now we need to find where K and L intersect:<br>  <br>  3x - 2y = 6<br>  3x + 2y = 6<br>  Add those two equations to eliminate 'y':<br>  6x = 12<br>  x = 2<br>  Put x = 2 back in either requation to get y = 0.<br>  <br>  So the point of intersection is (2, 0).

You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished.

It will continue to get higher in the sky.and at 12:30 a.m.it will be at its highest, when it will be in the south. You should look for the constellation Leo, which looks like a reversed question mark. Just below Leo, the brightest object is Saturn and Lulin is about halfway between Saturn and the bright star Regulus, which is the star at the bottom of the question mark. There is some information here: <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/35992534.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing...</a> and a fairly detailed star map here: <a href="http://media.skyandtelescope.com/documents/Comet_Lulin_Feb13.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.skyandtelescope.com/documen...</a><br>  You will need to check carefully with the detailed star map in order to find it and you will need a pair of binoculars as it only appears as a faint fuzzy blob.<br>  It will be visible on other evenings, appearing about 20 minutes earlier each night.

I checked the rise time of Saturn and it rizes at 18:35 GMT on 25-FEB-2009. However, you should wait until about 22:00hrs (when it's high in the sky) before attempting to view it. On 25-Feb Comet Lulin will be about half way between Saturn and Regulus (the brightest star in the Constellation Leo).  See the link below for a star map<br>  <br>  From my place here in the states I needed a pair of 10X50 Binoculars to see it.  In binoculars it will look a fuzzy slightly elongated smudge in the sky.  Another issue you'll need to deal with as the comet nears Regulus is that Messier objects M66, M65, M105, M96, and M95 are also in the area.  These objects may also be in your field of view and could look like fuzzy smudges or snowballs as well.  However, Comet Lulin should be blow these objects and should be slightly elongated.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	Yes, it's on the celestial equator, and so is visible everywhere in the world.

NuHwqWxCaa	first of all, it is sYmbiotic. Second, there are hardly any plants 'in' the ocean. Yes, you can find some plants on the intertidal flats (f.i. mangroves), but hardly in the ocean. The only example of plants living in an marine environment (that I know of), are seagrasses (families Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Ruppiaceae etc).<br>  <br>  The 'plants' in the ocean you speak of, are actually algae, which are quite different from plants.<br>  <br>  Some symbiotic relations in the ocean: But symbiosis can be defined in several ways. In general it includes all such interactions, whether harmful, helpful, or neutral. Some biologists define symbiosis more narrowly as a synonym for mutualism, in which both species benefit.<br>  <br>  So symbiosis covers in general parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. See wiki for many examples, but here are some to get you started:<br>  <br>  1. corals consist of a symbiotic mutualism of corraline anthozoans with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae which provide the anthozoans with sugars. The anthozoans are carnivorous filter-feeders, but zooplankton provide only about 10% of their daily energy requirements, the majority being provided by theri algal partners.<br>  <br>  2.mutiple species of cleaner fish and cleaner shrimps and the 'customer' fish, from which they remove parasites and dead skin. Removal of cleaner fish can cause a rapid onset of skin disease, and increased mortalities (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaner_fish)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaner_fis...</a><br>  <br>  3.The clownfish feeds on undigested matter which otherwise potentially could harm the sea anemone, and the faecal matter from the clownfish provides nutrients to the sea anemone. It has also been suggested that the activity of the clownfish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone. In addition to providing food for the clownfish, the sea anemone also provides safety due to its poison.<br>  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown_fish)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown_fish)</a><br>  <br>  4. a quite difficult symbiosis to understand: "the eater also gets eaten". Giant tube worms, Riftia pachyptila, are marine invertebrates in the phylum Annelida[1] (formerly grouped in phylum Pogonophora and Vestimentifera) related to tubeworms commonly found in the intertidal and pelagic zones. Riftia pachyptila lives over a mile deep and up to several miles deep on the floor of the Pacific Ocean near black smokers and can tolerate extremely high temperatures and sulfur levels. They can reach a length of 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in).<br>  <br>  They have a highly vascularized, red "plume" at the tip of their free end which is an organ for exchanging compounds with the environment (e.g., H2S, CO2, O2, etc). The tube worm does not have many predators, as few creatures live on the sea bottom at such depths. If threatened, the plume may be retracted into the worm's protective tube. The plume provides essential nutrients to bacteria living inside a specialized organ within their body (i.e., trophosome) as part of a symbiotic relationship. They are remarkable in that they have no digestive tract, but the bacteria (which may make up half of a worm's body weight) turn oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, etc. into organic molecules on which their host worms feed. <br>  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_tube_worms)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_tube_...</a><br>  <br>  5. Many deep sea fish are bioluminescent throught a symbiosis with bacteria.<br>  <br>  6. a recently new discoverd phylum in biology: Cycliophora. Symbion has a commensal relationship with the lobster (a form of symbiosis) – it feeds on the leftovers from the lobster's own meals.

It requires that the nucleii collide, and when they do it requires that they do so with sufficient energy for fusion to occur.<br>  <br>  Temperature is an average measurement of how fast each nucleus is going.

Technically, you could avoid the need to do a final extension step by having longer cycles, but this both increases the total time needed for PCR and decreases yield if amplifying from a plasmid, genome or other complex mix.

YHNK9UrQaa	Any question could be a good scientific question.  The trick is in getting a good scientific answer.  <br>  <br>  Scientific answers need to be tested and verifiable by experiments.  That means, other people should be able to do the experiment that you did and they should be able to obtain the same answers that you got.<br>  <br>  Questions like, “Why do people tell lies?” probably do have scientific answers, but human beings are very complex, and human environments are extremely varied, so it would be very difficult to isolate all of the situations that lead up to a person telling a lie, and then isolate all of the biochemical changes that happen just before a person tells a lie, etc.  Psychology deals with these aspects of human behaviour, and some people consider psychology to be a branch of science, but in fact, it is extremely difficult to get a good verifiable, scientific answer to a question about human behaviour.<br>  <br>  Questions like, “Is God real?” are even harder to answer by scientific methods.<br>  <br>  I don’t know why you are asking for examples of good scientific questions.  Are you trying to devise an experiment for a science fair?  What you probably need are examples of question that have testable, verifiable answers:<br>  <br>  Do plant stems still grow upwards when you suspend the plant upside down?<br>  Are caterpillars able to see?<br>  How can you measure the distance to a star?<br>  Why are some flowers brightly coloured?<br>  <br>  You could go on Yahoo Answers in the Science and Mathematics section and read through the questions.

What happens to the charge on a parallel plate capacitor if the potential difference doubles?<br>  <br>  Q = CV<br>  C doesn't change, V doubles, then Q doubles.<br>  <br>  4. You want to increase the maximum potential difference of a parallel plate capacitor. Describe how you can do this for a fixed plate capacitor.<br>  <br>  apply more voltage.<br>  <br>  5. If the potential difference across a capacitor is doubled, by what factor is the electrical potential energy stored in the capacitor multiplied?<br>  <br>  E = ?CV2 Energy in a cap<br>  4 times<br>  <br>  6. Two parallel plates are uncharged. Does the set of plates have a capacitance? Explain.<br>  <br>  yes. The capacitance is a function of the mechanical construction of the unit, has nothing to do with charge or voltage.<br>  <br>  Parallel plate cap<br>  C = ε?εr(A/d) in Farads<br>     ε? is 8.8542e-12 F/m<br>     εr is dielectric constant (vacuum = 1)<br>     A and d are area of plate in m2 and separation in m<br>  <br>  7. If you were asked to design a small capacitor with high capacitance, what factors would be important in your design?<br>  <br>  too vague: small capacitor and high capacitance are contradictory<br>  <br>  8. If the area of the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor is doubled while the spacing between the spacing between the plates is halved, how is the capacitance affected?<br>  <br>  Parallel plate cap<br>  C = ε?εr(A/d) in Farads<br>     ε? is 8.8542e-12 F/m<br>     εr is dielectric constant (vacuum = 1)<br>     A and d are area of plate in m2 and separation in m<br>  <br>  double the area (A) the cap is doubled<br>  cut the spacing in half, the cap is doubled again<br>  total 4x<br>  <br>  9. Why is it dangerous to touch the terminals of a high-voltage capacitor even after the potential difference has been removed? What can be done to make the capacitor safe to handle?<br>  <br>  because the cap stores voltage until discharged, which you do by applying   a short across it.<br>  <br>  10. Two capacitors have the same potential difference across them, but one has a large capacitance and the other has a small capacitance. You would get a greater shock from touching the leads of the one with high capacitance than you would from touching the one with low capacitance. From this information, explain what causes the sensation of shock?<br>  <br>  too vague<br>  <br>  11. A 12 v battery is connected to a 6.0 pF parallel plate capacitor.

PsCCd63yaa	First of all, you got your divisibility symbols backwards!  If 3|k, then 3|2k+3.  Let's prove it!<br>  <br>  3|k means there is some integer n such that k = 3n<br>  <br>  So, let's work with that!<br>  k = 3n<br>  2k = 6n<br>  2k + 3 = 6n + 3<br>  <br>  Hrm.  Time to FACTOR the part on the right!<br>  <br>  2k + 3 = 3(2n+1)<br>  <br>  But if n is an integer, so is 2n+1!  Let's call that integer p.  Thus...<br>  2k + 3 = 3p<br>  <br>  And, lo and behold, that means that there is some integer p such that 2k+3 is 3p.  That's the definition of divisiblity!  So...<br>  3 | 2k+3<br>  <br>  Here's a concrete way of thinking of it.  Let's say we know that 3 divides 483 into a certain number of groups evenly.  If we had twice as many as 483, we'd have twice as many groups.  If we had  3 MORE than twice as many as 483, we'd have twice as many groups, plus one extra group of 3.  That's where the "p = 2n + 1" part comes in.|`|AA11508270	To start with, it should be 3 |(2k + 3) not the other way around.<br>  <br>  Just use the definition of what it means to divide.  <br>  <br>  If 3 divide k, then:<br>  <br>  k = 3x, x is any integer<br>  <br>  Plug 3x into the k in the expression: 2k + 3<br>  <br>  2(3x) + 3 = 6x + 3 = 3(2x + 1)<br>  <br>  Letting 2x + 1 = m, then<br>  <br>  6x + 3 = 3m, which means that 3 always divides 2k + 3, whenever 3 divides k.

Although the conditions for life on a planet are very specific, there has to be somewhere other life. In fact, using simple logic, there must be an infinite number of planets with life on them, unless there is a point in the universe where there is nothing but darkness, which could be the case.<br>  Also, it is impossible for two given universes (within a tetraspace) to be exactly parallel, and there must be portals somewhere in our universe (again, an infinite number of these portals because tetraspace is also infinite). So, aliens from other universes - with completely different laws - could be in our universe after coming through these portals. (one theory is that black holes are these portals, but I think that the portal would be a constantly moving, infinitely stretching plane.<br>  Whether or not they have visited earth, I cannot say.  The evidence of them visiting seems to point toward such an answer, but considering the supposed law that nothing can travel faster than the spped of light and the fact that earth is incredibly far away from any planet whose surroundings meet the conditions for sustaining life, it would seem impossible.  Despite this, they probably have - somehow.  Perhaps they have evolved to travel at incredible speeds and/or developed longer lifespans.<br>  I would suggest you watch the movie, "Alien Plant".<br>  In short, my answer is a resounding yes.|`|6GJnprHuaa	They could have visited earth because a girl found a bizarre looking skull years ago in a cave. the skull is nothing like a human. this is the site. and also, in egypt some people found hieroglyphs showing helicopters, submarine, plane. bizarre eh!! this is the site for both.|`|AA11564934	yes they exist,no they haven't visited|`|LRH9Em0yaa	They definatley are out there...

Weight is a force that we feel on Earth, caused by gravity and our mass. Since gravity is calculated using the units of , therefore it is an acceleration constant. We could come to the conclusion that:<br>  <br>  W = mg|`|VPhYOWxwaa	he first answerer is referring to Newton's fist law. That of inertia. The second law states:<br>  <br>  Observed from an inertial reference frame, the net force on a particle of constant mass is proportional to the time rate of change of its linear momentum: F = d(mv)/dt. This law is often stated as, "Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)": the net force on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.<br>  <br>  Basically this just means:<br>  a) that for two objects of different masses to accelerate at the same rate, the larger mass has to be acted on by a greater force.<br>  b) that for two objects of different masses acted on by the same amount of force, the less massive will accelerate more.<br>  <br>  These are really just two different ways of saying the same thing. That Newton summed up as F=ma. This is a very important equation and I suggest learning it very well.<br>  <br>  I keep coming up with demonstrations that are either too complicated or too dangerous so I'll leave it at that for now, and maybe come back if I think of one. But hopefully you understand the concept and will be able to come up with your own demo from that understanding. That would be much more rewarding anyway :). Good Luck!|`|9v31wUz1aa	Newton's 2nd law states that the rate of change of momentun is proportional to the applied force which is usually simplified as F=ma. <br>  <br>  so applying a force makes an object accelerate. doubling the force makes it accelerate twice a much.<br>  doubling the mass makes it acclerate half as much.<br>  <br>  I used to demonstrate this on an air track in my lab to year 10 pupils.<br>  The object could be given a repeatable force form a compreesed spring. The resulting acceleration could be measured using a light gate attached to a computer. The mass of the object could be increased easily in measured amounts and the changes in accleration also measured. The result drawn on a graph will prove the law.<br>  It can perhaps be done more simply for year 7 pupils by hitting a ball with a constant force. Measure how far it goes - increase the size of the ball and hit it with the same force - it goes less far. Not accurate but gives the basic idea.|`|hom5vhrAaa	everyone seems to be confusing the first and second laws<br>  <br>  Newton's second law states "The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object."<br>  <br>  that can be summed up in the following equation<br>  <br>  acceleration=force/mass<br>  <br>  Basically, acceleration is affected by both the force applied and the mass.<br>  The more force you apply to the object, the faster it will accelerate<br>  so,   more force=more acceleration<br>  Since increasing one increases the other, it is called "directly proportional"<br>  <br>  The more mass something has, the slower it will accelerate<br>  so,   more mass=less acceleration<br>  since increasing one decreases the other, it is called "inversely proportional"<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|53pargZ3aa	objects dont move unless acted on by an outside force|`|5437985b95888863b86a1b13cbbbd60eaa	if you put a ball down it wont move unless being pushed. a ball will keep rolling unless its rolling on something that will stop it.<br>  <br>  <br>  the playstation controller doesnt move unless you move it.

cnPKAlDYaa	You're pretty much right - <br>  <br>  Line graphs provide an excellent way to map independent and dependent variables that are both quantitative. When both variables are quantitative, the line segment that connects two points on the graph expresses a slope, which can be interpreted visually relative to the slope of other lines or expressed as a precise mathematical formula. Scatter plots are similar to line graphs in that they start with mapping quantitative data points. The difference is that with a scatter plot, the decision is made that the individual points should not be connected directly together with a line but, instead express a trend. This trend can be seen directly through the distribution of points or with the addition of a regression line. A statistical tool used to mathematically express a trend in the data.

15mbP1hqaa	The boiling point depends on the molecular mass and/or molecule mass of the material. It applies: The larger the molecular mass is, the more highly is the boiling point. If one compares for example the row HCl (36 g/mol) - HBr (81 g/mol) - REAR ONE (128 g/mol) on the dark-blue line, then one can recognize this connection well. Explanation: The larger the mass of a particle is, the more kinetic energy needs it over into the gaseous phase to cross to be able.<br>  The boiling point depends besides on the strength of the binding forces between the smallest particles of the liquid phase: The stronger the binding forces are, the more highly are the boiling point, since these would have to be first overcome. This becomes clear, if one compares for example HF and HCl: In the liquid hydrogen fluoride the molecules train hydrogen bonds, while in liquid hydrogen chloride the weaker dipole dipole reciprocal effects prevail. Same apply for the comparatively very much high boiling point the water, which clear become, if one this with dioxide compare and the influence the mass with consider.

AA10335036	Ionization depends only on the total energy input, not the photon energies (ref.). <br>  Assuming the production of one ion pair is equivalent to an elementary charge unit, NCoulombs/pair = 1.6022E-19. Then total pairs = 2.5E-5/1.6022E-19.<br>  EDIT: The ref. says "... the charge on a single ion is 1.6 x 10^-19 C..."; in other words these ions are singly charged. The x-ray photon doesn't carry charge, its energy just moves charge. So the "C" in "C/kg" really means an amount of charge moved. One electron forced by 34 eV from the x-ray photon to pass from one originally neutral atom to another will result in a pair of oppositely and singly charged ions. Thus an ion pair is overall electrically neutral.<br>  Note that as an expression of energy/mass, the C/kg is "calibrated" to air. In this context 1 C is the energy equivalent of 34/1.6022E-19 eV. This same amount of energy will produce a different number of C moved and thus of ion pairs in media other than air with different ionization potentials. Or we can say generating the same number of C moved will require a different amount of energy in media other than air.

It is because the roots are the water absorbing system of the plants, in case of hydrophytes the different parts of the plants parts are in direct contact with water that's why it does not require roots.<br>     But, it is not cent percent correct to the terrestrial plants because all most all terrestrial plants are grows in the soil and with out root they never grows there because the roots not only act as absorbing organs but also act as anchoring organs. It hold the plants to the soil very tightly to protect it from any damage cause by nature. In case of tall plants the roots are highly required because it goes very deep to the soil to absorve the deep soil water and mineral ions require for it. Another point of view without absorbing the soil water by roots the metabolic activities is never being carried out by plants because all the metabolic activity are going on by the interfering of different groups of enzyme and the enzyme do there action only in liquid condition..
