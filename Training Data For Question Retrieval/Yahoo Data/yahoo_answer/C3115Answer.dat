e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Every job has you dealing with people in one form or another.  I'm terribly shy too.  But I worked as a housekeeper [hated it] and as a Sales Associate at a women's clothing store [also hated it]. I didn't hate either because I had to talk to people [though I hated trying to trick people into buying expensive ugly clothing] but because I just... hated being there.. um..    My brother got a job at blockbuster about 3-4 years ago when he was still living at home [he was.. 21 I believe]. It was just a temp job..which turned into a fulltime.. than he moved up to a shift manager and works 8 hours a day and over minimum wage and has rents his own apartment near work.  Any job can help you live anywhere but living at home helps you save money.. Remember to be fugal with you're money but offer to pay for things for you're parents [and they might give you some cash before they leave].    There's ALWAYS a job.. i live in Lindsay and thought these are crappy jobs.. but this telemarketing place is always hiring.. same with a dollarama.. But i'm not sure about windsor.    Make it a habit to bookmark the Job bank canada website.. I always check there, it's helped me in the past in finding job prospects not listed in stores or newspapers.    You could always try working as a day/night stock person at a department store. Or work at a convience store.  I was always nervous my first days working with customers but.. it's easier after you get into the swing of things..  I'm sure a local college [or human resource style place] offers free or cheap classes in dealing with diffcult customers or cashier training.    In Lindsay there's a place that's funded by human resources canada [called victoria county career services] and they help you make resumes, cover letters, job search.. they offer training classes [like food safe handler, WHIMIS, career seaching [finding careers that fit you'e personality and learning style] and cashier training] and they usually foot the bill too.  I'm sure there's a similar place near you.    Don't let yourself settle for a crap job like telemarketer or something like that.  But some jobs can open doors, others have no way up.|`|2WfHLUyOaa	its a horrible time to be 18 and looking for work..im unemployed 2... goodluck|`|CTdacyOxaa	go to http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/Intro_eng.aspx search up a job. i hope this helps.

Do not choose Bank of America!|`|uhesaD2Saa	well FARGO is ok but if you can manage to keep 10,000 in your bank which i know is hard to do for anyone right now. you get free bank checks and money orders, a lot Better interest rate plus other things. I cant keep 10,000 in there so I don't have BOA   when your looking for a bank look for the apr your going to be receiving and in this economy it sucks so don't worry to much about that because if you have less then 10,000 your not going to be making to much on your interest anyway.   look more for stuff you need. like free checks (if you use them) and free cards if you lose them i lose my card all the time; $25 dollars each time to replace.

AA11452852	There are basically three processes in fabricating leather goods.  Machines can do each of these jobs.    Cutting:  The general name for machines that do this are usually just called "leather cutting tools."  Some of the tools that are used are called leather cutting dies, leather cutting tables, and leather cutting presses.    Punching:  These tools put holes into the leather, to allow the pieces to be sewed together.  They are generally just called "leather punches," although there are some smaller tools (hand tools) like punch pliers, that are also used.    Stitching:  Again, leather stitching machines are usually called just that.  Sometimes, they are offered as "leather sewing machines."    To make a particular handbag design, you might need some specialized equipment as well, such as an embossing tool.  But the three machines above are pretty standard.    I hope this helps!!|`|WaI693jHaa	If that is English I'm afraid I must have forgotten how to speak it. I'm afraid I don't know what you are asking.|`|JODVNkU8aa	Try searching the internet for industrial leather sewing machines, you can sew leather with any industrial type machine it is the needles that are important for this type of work.  From the amount of questions you have asked regarding this matter, I would say that you need to find out what you are doing first as I don't think you have a clue.

64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	Integrate a scrapbooking section into your store.  Scrapbooking is big business these days.   It goes hand-in-hand with photography.  The people who come to buy the scrapbooking materials (everything from paper, scissors, stickers, albums, etc) may also start using your printing services too.  Make a promotion where if you spend X amount in scrapbooking supplies, you'll get x number of free prints.  (Even if this doesn't seem to fit with your current clientele, the goal is to bring new people in.  Scrapbookers will travel to a well stocked store)    Another idea would be to add a portrait studio, taking family or kids photos.  Or if you want to get really hip, how about taking boudoir photos?  Or makeover photos where someone does their hair and makeup then you take flattering photos.    Another idea would be to hold classes/workshops - on how to take great photos or black/white photography (and there are many classes you could hold if you're doing scrapbooking)    Good Luck.   It seems like the photo business must be slowing down with many people printing their own photos at home so it's good that you want to be proactive to keep your business current.|`|eXHFp9L7aa	Maybe a paint job (I'm thinking a nice, bright colour), and hanging some different photos on the walls?
