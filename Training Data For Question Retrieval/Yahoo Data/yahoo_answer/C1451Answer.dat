Para el sacerdote hebreo tambin se suele emplear el vocablo mal' ak "ngel"; para el sacerdote idoltrico se emplea la palabra heb.  k?mer.  El trmino espa?ol "sacerdote" proviene de 2 palabras latinas, sacerdos y otis, referidas al ministro de un determinado culto.    I. Oficio.    Persona debidamente consagrada para ministrar en cosas sagradas como mediador entre el hombre y Dios, y para ofrecer sacrificios por los pecados de los hombres (He. 5:1; 8:1-3; cf v 6). Como institucin, el sacerdocio se fundamenta en el concepto de que el hombre por naturaleza no goza del favor de Dios, y por tanto necesita de un mediador que conozca los caminos del Se?or y pueda llevar a cabo la reconciliacin.  En Israel, as como en otras naciones de la antigedad, los sacerdotes constituan una clase diferente (Gn.41:45; Ex. 2:16; 1 S. 6:2; Hch. 14:13).  Durante la monarqua, generalmente el sumo sacerdote ocupaba un lugar inmediato al del monarca, tanto en rango como en dignidad e influencia, y en ocasiones ejerca el poder detrs del trono.  El principal papel que desempe?aban los sacerdotes hebreos consista en presentar "ofrendas y sacrificios por los pecados" (He. 5:1;cf 8:3), con el fin de "expiar [lograr reconciliacin por] los pecados del pueblo" (2:17), con lo que, figuradamente,volvan a poner los seres humanos bajo el favor divino.      Era "necesario" que el sacerdote  tuviera "algo que ofrecer" (8:3), puesto que, simblicamente, cuando Dios aceptaba el sacrificio, tambin aceptaba la splica de aquel en cuyo favor  se lo ofreca. Adems de ministrar los ritos sagrados, se consideraba que los sacerdotes eran maestros religiosos del pueblo (Lv. 10:11; Dt. 33:10;  Ez. 44:23; cf Esd.7:25). En ocasin de la conquista de Canan no recibieron herencia entre las tribus, pero se les asignaron 13 ciudades rodeadas de campos de pastoreo y de huertas (Jos. 21:10-19; 1 Cr. 6:57-60).  No se deban dedicar a ninguna tarea que implicara lucro, sino que tenan que ser sostenidos exclusivamente por los diezmos y ciertas ofrendas especiales (Lv. 10:12-15; 23:17-20; Nm.18:11, 20; Dt. 18:3-5).  Incluso los fsicamente  defectuosos, provenientes de familias de sacerdotes, que por esa causa no podan ministrar delante del altar, tenan derecho a ese sostn (Lv. 21:21-23).  En tiempos de Esdras los sacerdotes  estaban exentos de pagar impuestos (Esd. 7:24).    II. Vestimenta.    En trminos generales inclua el efod* de lino (heb, 'f?d bad) y la tnica (heb. mets?l qat?n).  La de los sacerdotes simples comprenda 4 partes: kutt?neth, prenda en forma de camisa; 'abnt, ce?idor; migba{ah, tocado para la cabeza (gorro abovedado en forma de cu?a); y miknes bad, calzones de lino que deban cubrir los rganos genitales y el cuerpo desde las caderas hasta las rodillas (Ezequiel recurre a otros vocablos: el gorro es pa'ar pisht?m ["turbante de lino"], y la vestidura siempre es bigd pishtl?m ["vestiduras de lino"]).  El sumo sacerdote usaba un vestido blanco de lino (keth?neth bad q?dsh), y turbante (mitsnefeth), calzones y ce?idor de lino (el uso del lino est justificado en Ez. 44:18; ropa ligera, no transparente, pero sobre todo que no haga traspirar).  Para oficiar en la ceremonia: bolsa, pectoral con 12 piedras preciosas y el Urim* y el Tumim, efod colorido Y bordado primorosamente, tnica azul con campanitas en el ruedo, camisa,  turbante* o mitra y ce?idor.  En la parte delantera del turbante haba una especie de flor de oro puro (ts?ts zahab tah?r) que tena grabada la inscripcin "Santidad a Yahweh" (q?desh le- yahweh).  Nada se dice de calzados, ni para los sumos sacerdotes ni para los sacerdotes comunes (1 S. 2:18; 22:18; Ex. 28:1- 42).    III. Responsables.    En los primeros tiempos, antes que hubiera un sacerdocio organizado, ciertas personas, como Can y Abel (Gn, 4:3-5), ofrecan sacrificios y ejercan las funciones esenciales de un sacerdote (cf Ex. 19:21,22).  Aun despus de la organizacin de un sacerdocio regular, ciertos individuos ofrecan sacrificios  en circunstancias especiales (Jue. 6:18, 24, 26; 13:16).  Durante toda la dispensacin patriarcal el jefe de la familia o de la tribu se desempe?aba generalmente como sacerdote.  Por eso No (Gn. 8:20), Abrahn (22:13), Jacob (35:3) y Job (Job 1:5) sirvieron como sacerdotes de sus respectivas familias.    Al establecerse la teocracia en el Sina, y al erigirse el tabernculo, Dios encomend a la tribu de Lev que se encargara de sus sagrados ritos en lugar de los primognitos o los jefes de las familias (Nm. 3:6-13).  Se escogi a la tribu de Lev por la lealtad que manifest en ocasin de la adoracin del  becerro de oro (Ex. 32:26-29).  Se separ a Aarn y a sus hijos para el oficio sacerdotal, y desde ese momento slo ellos desempe?aran tal cargo (Nm. 3: 10).     El sacerdocio era hereditario en el caso de su familia (Ex. 28:1; 40:12-15; Nm. 16:40; 17; 18:1-8), de modo que cada descendiente suyo de sexo masculino tena el derecho a ser sacerdote, a menos que tuviera un defecto fsico (Lv.   21:17-21) o estuviera 1022 temporariamente "impuro" (22:3).  Segn Lv. 21:10; Nm. 35:25,28, etc., por su oficio, Aarn era "sumo sacerdote" y sacerdote "ungido" (Lv. 4:3,5,16).  Como "el sacerdote" vitalicio (Ex. 31:10), transmita el derecho a su cargo sagrado al mayor de sus descendientes calificados.  Por eso, le sucedi su hijo Eleazar (Nm. 20:28; Dt. 10:6), quien a su vez fue reemplazado por su primognito Finees (Nm. 25:11), en cuyo tiempo se estableci definidamente la sucesin del sumo sacerdocio (vs 12,13).  En un sentido especial, el sumo sacerdote representaba a todo Israel, y los sacerdotes   comunes servan en su nombre y como representantes suyos.|`|41f5af51a793cfc7c00bb36fe0293573aa	Prroco, Pastor, Padre, Cura.|`|4cabf744dae2669f174edf07c3029c0eaa	Pedfilo.|`|cf6e81ead4af18eaa05a88a61cb193cdaa	...ltimamente hay uno.....

Estas vestiduras tericamente no indican un poder sobre nadie, son indicativo de una funcin de servicio a los dems.    Y los sacerdotes amenudo aun usan sotana, clergam u otros distintivos para que se les identifique con su funcin.

e57df07c307f87b98fbbda57befdfa29aa	Yes, I had heard that Josephus, the Jewish historian had confirmed his existence. The fact that so many people follow his teachings, or at least claim too, makes it more unbeleiveable that he didn't exist. Even Gandhi praised His teachings. No one claims that the history of the persecuted christians is made up. How could these people risk their lives for a fictional character?    Additional note;  in response to Kissmyku'  s   view about all the different messiahs, perhaps the Bible makes the best point of all when it records the account of Gamiliel , a prominent Phaisee, and what he had to say about the early Christians at Acts 5     33But when they heard this, they were (AU)cut to the quick and intended to kill them.    34But a Pharisee named (AV)Gamaliel, a (AW)teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in (AX)the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time.      35And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.      36"For some time ago Theudas rose up, (AY)claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.      37"After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of (AZ)the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.      38"So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action (BA)is of men, it will be overthrown;      39but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found (BB)fighting against God."      40They took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they (BC)flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then released them|`|5ab3665dd0c477ad8d7d745ebc949f38aa	Flavius Josephus.. of course wrote of Jesus  but there are more and probably dozens Some are given here http://www.rationalchristianity.net/jesu...    there are also  indirect historical things...   the Romans made it a capital crime to rob a grave a few years after Jesus death...seems they were annoyed about an empty tomb    AND there is a rather lame story about a gardener named Judas who amazingly  'got wind' before dawn  that the disiples were going to steal the body  and 'moved it' Sounds like damage control to me.

Proving the existance of Jesus, archaeologically or otherwise, doesn't prove God. A man was alive and founded a religion. So what?

Now to your fiance:  First ask him what he thinks about bisexual females.  If he gives you a bigoted answer, then don't tell him.  You're better off.  If you get a favorable reaction and he seems open-minded,  tell him about your attraction to other women; that you're bi.  If he is open-minded, he will still love you the way you are and accept you the way you are.    One thing: if he mentions having a threesome with you and your "girlfriend", that is a bad reaction.  You're heading into a bad situation and you should get out of the relationship. Seriously.    One more thing: Pay no attention to what "preacher" said.  He is not a real Christian.  Jesus loves bis and homosexuals just as He loves ALL of His children.

I know because I am in a gay straight alliance organization and I know all of the terms. So ignore them, hon. From me to you, you should just keep it to yourself. Its your personal business. DFepending on whether he is a straight and narrow Christian I would definitely keep it to myself. You own your body and your mind...why let some man scare you into submission?

It's normal for sexual urges to wane as you age.    Also, make sure you haven't let yourself go.  Have you gained a bunch of weight?  Do you make an effort to get a haircut regularly and take care of your other hygene and clothing?  I know it's not nice to think that the way you look should be enough to make your love lose interest, but the fact of the matter is, it just does.    And, uh, this is a sensitive question, but if you're on the bottom, er, uh, maybe there's not as much friction as there used to be?  I don't know any other way to say it.    Maybe he's self-concious about something.  Has HE gained weight?  Any problems with "function"?  Is he under undue stress because of something else?  Sometimes stress or depression can lessen desire.    Have you tried to get him to talk about what's going on?  Maybe you should.  And there's always couples counselling.    Now WHY did I get a thumbs-down??|`|2e1cf6d8e7436f89b0e41efb38d89671aa	Why don't you try being with a woman?
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	I think you're overly sensitive. You cannot control how other people answer so just take some answers with a grain of salt and let it roll off your shoulder.    All you do when you whine about it is attract unwanted negative attention to yourself. There are all kinds of people in here. Focus on the positive if you cannot deal with the negative.|`|81ce8fc06e11149869860f71cb7ee933aa	Those were some crazy answers. Especially the one about --why is your step-dad in your room?  That person was serious. Just delete that question and ask about this another day.    About your sleep problem---I don't know what is going on. So I can't give an answer.|`|AA10691438	I get it too and Im a Christian. My questions are usually valid serious questions (once in a while some are in light hearted fun) I dont even leave a link on my messages but my 360 can be accessed on my profile. People get sooooooooo upset that I make an alcohol reference on my page, or they take it upon themselves to assume my picture is something bad.    I'd suggest that you dont take it as Christians attacking you... take it as wackos attacking you because I'm a Christain and you wont ever see me acting like those you have encountered.|`|AA11969451	Some people are just mean. No other explanation!!!    As for your sleep condition, my son did things like this in his teens. It as if he was truly in between worlds.  Try setting up a protective bubble when sleeping and perhaps doing some magic pertaining to a more restful dream state.  Hugz to you  )O(|`|ecc566b2b7a4878c96826d3e51111de5aa	In answer to your original question, you were probably talking in tongues.  At night, when you sleep, the mind is very open to anything, which is why we have dreams.  It is also open to spiritual experiences.  This is a good thing and nothing to worry about.  In fact, it is something that you should encourage yourself to do.  Talking in tongues has nothing to do with salvation---it is a form of worshiping God, and this is something that you cannot do too much.  Ignore the retards that want to poke fun at you.  Jesus will handle them.  Pay attention to your spiritual life instead.|`|58e73f525c0e104eee52a2d224f248ebaa	christians want something to attack a teenage girl can be easy prey for a christian nutjob that thinks they know whats best, ive heard that christian missionaries are interested in anyone under 18 because it gives them the edge and at that age kids dont know what they want or what they believe, I got out at a much later age but im still resentful to my family for raising me christian in the first place, but at least ive had the experience and it sure didnt leave me wanting more.

Grow some thick skin or else you won't survive in this forum.    Read your question. A cousin of mine had same experiences on a daily basis. He would wake up in the middle of the night and start rumbling something in a language unknown to us. We still don't know what was going on with him - it just stopped one day. But if you ask me - personally, I do believe that during sleep we are travelling and conecting with the world(s) beyond our consciousness - if it makes any sense LOL.    Well, I surely wish you a good night - don't wander too much LOL|`|710dfcc71cbfcc84cf4577342e829c53aa	Ignore them, for they no nothing but what is feed to them.|`|391acbab2f0e75277afb1e6b189a1ac3aa	Some people are and will do anything just to get a point or two.

Some even more dangerous conditions people attempt to go jogging or driving.  Id see a doctor to get a referral to a specialist if  i were you|`|d305842b650b66637e3a855c4479694aaa	The fundies feel they LITERALLY have a God-given right to seek out anything that may indicate to them the absence of God or consorting with the devil and bash the "sinner" over the head with their message.    I agree, one forum shouldn't bleed over into another.    As for your sleeping problem, I would guess you were asleep but in some form of sleepwalking state, and not necessarily talking in another language so much as talking "gibberish" that sounded like another language (which is why he couldn't recognize it).  You're not possessed by demons, but if you do keep having sleeping episodes like this you may want to go to a sleep center to pinpoint the cause.  Usually stress can do this to you.    Bright blessings!  )O(

The Vatican is God's headquarters on earth. It should look like it, as should his CEO.    The last guy to complain about such things was Judas, and Jesus told him that the poor would always be with us, and that certain expenditures made to glorify God were certainly acceptable.    Finally, the Catholic Church feeds more poor people in more countries around the world than any other church, and almost every other organization of any kind.|`|37dafdfc637aa8276a62169032fae519aa	and what do YOU do with the ten dollars an hour YOU make, Sam?|`|AA11154080	leave pope's racket alone!! hehe|`|63f6377a235f1f29079c6821d748d8f4aa	I agree with you. that goes for all religious leaders who do the same thing as you just mentioned. that's something else that just doesn't make sense. ignore the attacks, I'm glad you're speaking the truth.|`|0be4950a0a16bc64c853967cc0037f0daa	Pope is a holy person and his house lies in the Vatican. Things or people with great importance should be treated and kept sacred. People would do anything to maintain it. Regardless of the fact that people would spent is really not a big thing coz usually people from all walks of life and even the government would give money just to see that the place of holiness will be beautiful. Coz it's not only for the Pope but it is also for us. Tourists and even the people would live there would be proud coz there lies a majestic place where the messenger of God stays. Yes, Jesus taught us to be humble but specifically he points to us that we should not be extravagant, and use our money and resources in the right way. We're just giving back the BLESSINGS we have received from him by adorning the walls of Vatican by making it beautiful. I am not being biased, but come to think of it, there's no other place to be considered holy than the Vatican---coz there lies the holy person---our Pope.|`|ccc73b12c38b3c46166220277e7cfc59aa	He is the numero uno representative of God to the Catholics...that's gotta be a tough job.

Bueno la verdad es que la mala educacin, los malos modales, la falta de tica y de tacto siempre es ms facil de llevar que la buena educacin y los buenos modales. Acaso est penado por La Ley, el que insultes a alguien o que respondas mal, que no pidas por favor la hora a alguin cuando no tienes reloj o que interrumpas una conversacin, sin ni siquiera pedir perdn...    En fin, parece que hacer da?o, siempre ha estado de moda, y faltar mucho ms. Tendemos a ser egostas y a no valorar la mayora de detalles que se nos brindan en deredor. Cuando lo tienes todo, tiendes a ser ms maleducado, que si te falta cualquier cosa.     He tenido colegas en la discoteca, que no solo me piden un cigarrillo sin decir la "palabra mgica", sino que adems tienen la tremenda cara de seguir pidindome cigarrillos despus.    La verdad es que es de sabios ser educados, mejora la calidad de vida social, el humor de todas y cada una de las personas que  habitamos en este mundo, y la forma de llevar cada cosa.    Te has fijado en l@s encargad@s de las cajas registradora. Muchas veces tienen un humor de perros, y no es para menos, pues encima de trabajar cantidad de horas, la gente ni siquiera tiene el detalle de valorar su trabajo y su horario. Lo mismo pasa en otros mbitos de trabajo, ambitos escolares y familiares, conllevando a la situacin de abandono y revelda social.     ?tanto cuesta ser educad@s?....    A mi me parece que este mundo tiene mucha cara dura, y busca siempre escusas para justificar su "erroneo comportamiento".     Pero la verdad es otra.    El mundo cada vez ms y ms se est convirtiendo en el "cubo de la basura", en cuestin de la confianza, la comunicacin y la responsabilidad social. Pues no constituye ni delito, ni sancin alguna.     Nadie le faltara el respeto a un agente de la autoridad, pues sabe que eso constituye un delito. Pero... ?por qu no faltar al respeto a cualquier ciudadano ?, si esto no constituye pena alguna.    Los cobardes se amparan en grupos.     Las chicas que se rien de t, se amparan en sus padres, hermanos, primos, novios, etc... Los tios que van de "duros" por la vida, conocen a cantidad de gente dispuesta a partirte las piernas, si les contestas a sus insultos... Esto ms que un mundo parece un "apartado terrorista".    Las normas no se respetan, al Gobierno le da lo mismo. El libro de La Constitucin, parece un comic a estas alturas.     Qu se debera hacer... habr que ser extremistas-radicales ?    El tercer mundo se muere de hambre, pero bueno a mi que me importa, no me van a decir nada, si no aporto nada. Y si lo aporto, mis vecinos ni siquiera me darn una palmada en la espalda.    Llego a clase y tengo que respetar al profesor, pero el puede faltarme al respeto. Puedo denunciarlo a la Administracin de Estudios, pero es como "escupir contra viento", pues la A.D.E. no  har nada, o como mucho le llamar la atencin.    El Malestar Social viene causado por la falta de la mayora de derechos constitucionales, pero las personas, "ignorantes" de estas normas, siguen su cotidiano ritmo de malestar social.     Y que hay de las personas educadas, justas, con tica, con tacto. Personas que ayudan a que el da que vives sea ms agradable, pues apenas abundan.     No culpar a los medios de comunicacin, ni a la msica heavy, etc... pero si subrayo el hecho de que la mayora de la gente, est    buscando "fiesta" constantemente, y sobretodo cuando tiene guardadas las espaldas.    Por ltimo, el hecho de no dar las gracias o no pedir "por favor" algo, es bastante denigrante y debera tomarse tan en cuenta, como el tener los estudios completados para conseguir un buen puesto de trabajo.     Pero que quieres que te diga... si eres un barman y me sirves el caf frio o, no como te lo he pedido y encima me cobras, no esperes que te lo agradezca en lo ms mnimo. Pues eres T quien me ha faltado y no YO.     La cuestin es el Egosmo Concntrico, esa es la cuestin. La misma que nos lleva a plantear mal el comienzo del da ... "uff y ahora tengo que ver a este tio... cago...".     As que la nica forma es una buena educacin desde que somos ni?os hasta la mejor predisposicin ante cualquier situacin. De esa forma tendremos un punto de vista ms amplio y la tica suficiente, para estar en la piel de la otra persona.    Pero es solo una idea.    Y disculpa el repertorio filosfico, que an no me he tomado un buen caf. xD|`|2d7781d5b8e7a20875351a7a16f6d24daa	especie en extincin.  jaj  Bye!|`|779cc269e451ac0b2749bc8213c37b02aa	No creo,  Aunque a veces ser un poco mal educado  no pasa nada , sobre todos con los que quieren tomarte el pelo.

Always be kind. yes, I am a born again Christian and I am starting to see kindness coming from people I never thought possible. I too do not smoke or drink.

Another dream I had around the same time included one of death and destruction...I was a person caught in the midst of a bloddy war and could feel my flesh melting away from my body.  As my body slowly began to hit the ground, I could see a red sky filled with smoke.  Everyone around me was in despair....cyring and full of grief.  I was surrounded with death.

In the latter, they actually move into your body.  A spirit that follows someone generally is not harmful or dangerous. He may just up and leave one day and you will never hear from him again.|`|7d4679dd4f83cd75389d5336efd16799aa	Maybe you have schizophrenia--or perhaps you are allowing your imagination to get the best of you.

This isn't a possession, it is simply a ghost that is keeping you company.  As long as there is no harm done, I wouldn't worry about it.    In fact, if he is this loyal to you that he has followed you when you moved, then you might be able to use his presence to your advantage.  If the ghost is around and anyone tries to hurt you or steal anything from you, the ghost will act as your protector and manifest itself in such a manner as to scare the person away so you will be safe.    In that way, you could consider yourself lucky.

Some Christians claim that 'us' referres to the Holy Trinity; however, the concept of the Holy Trinity was created for the very first time during the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, nearly 400 years after the Bible was compiled back in the 6th Century B.C.; therefore there was not ONE single God, but many of them;)

Existen porque todos dicen tener la correcta interpretacin de la Biblia. Pero si eso fuera cierto, no existiran todas esas sectas. Si todos usaran solamente la Biblia, no habra ningn conflicto.

La sectas y religiones existen por el afn de poder de las personas. Al ser dirigente, pastor, obispo o como se llame se obtiene poder. Es puro egosmo al fin. Mira como las csectas islmicas se matan en Irak, protestantes y catlicos en Europa.  No creas en la biblia, ese libro es malo, malo. Tal vez no te parezca as porque desde ni?o nos leen los pasajes menos feos. Busca, un ejemplo entre muchos, Numeros 15 v 35 y lee como el dios de los cristianos ordena matar a un hombre a pedradas. Eso debi doler.  La respuesta: EL DIOS DE LA BIBLIA NO ES DIOS.

Y luego antes de irse al cielo envi a sus apstoles a hacer discpulos de todas las naciones (Mateo 28:19,20). Cumpliendo con est comisin los apstoles de Cristo predicaron a una gran multitud un da de Pentecosts esto ocurri unos pocos das despus de que Jesucristo se fue al cielo (Segn,  Hechos captulos 1,2). Fue en est ocasin que el apstol Pedro inspirado por el Espritu Santo, dijo a los reunidos lo que deban de hacer para recibir el perdn de sus pecados, Pedro les dijo: arrepentos y bautcese cada uno de vosotros en el nombre de Jesucristo para el perdn de los pecados; y recibiris el don del Espritu Santo, (Hechos 2:38).    Es as que la promesa de Jess de edificar su iglesia, tiene aqu segn Hechos 2, su fiel cumplimiento. Los que obedecieron el evangelio predicado en este da de Pentecosts llegaron a ser discpulos y conformaron la iglesia  (Hechos 5:11), y desde entonces todos los que eran y son obedientes al evangelio predicado por los apstoles eran, y son, a?adidos por el Se?or a la iglesia (Hechos 2:47), Iglesia que l gano por su propia sangre (Hechos 2:28).    Estos primeros hombres y mujeres obedientes a Cristo no llegaron a ser miembros de una secta o denominacin religiosa, sino que llegaron a ser miembros de la iglesia que Cristo edific, y el nombre con el cual a estos discpulos se les llam, fue con el de CRISTIANOS.    Se les llam as por revelacin divina, en Hechos 11:26 leemos  Y a los discpulos se les llam CRISTIANOS por primera vez en Antioqua. No se les llam as por voluntad humana, ni era un trmino despectivo en contra de ellos, sino que fue el nombre que Dios les dio.    La palabra llam en Hechos 11:26 es traducida de la palabra griega Chrematidzo que significa un orculo Divino  o dar un mandamiento Divino, aparece en Mateo 2:12 donde se traduce avisados por revelacin tambin en Mateo 2:22 donde se traduce avisado por revelacin  tambin aparece en Lucas 2:26, le haba sido revelado as pues el nombre de cristiano fue un nombre revelado por Dios es el nombre que Dios haba determinado desde tiempos antiguos, cuando dijo por medio del profeta Isaas Yo les dar lugar en m casa y dentro de mis muros, y nombre mejor que el de hijos e hijas nombre perpetuo les dar, que nunca perecer (Isa. 56:5) y tambin dice en Isaas 62:2 Y te ser puesto un nombre nuevo que la boca de Jehov nombrar. El nombre que les dio, o con el cual la boca de Dios les nombr fue con el de cristianos.    El apstol Pedro dijo:Pero si alguno padece como cristiano no se avergence, sino glorifique a Dios por ello (1 Pedro 4:16). El rey Agripa  dijo a Pablo el apstol Por poco me persuades a ser cristiano (Hechos 26:28).    ?Por qu Pedro no dijo, si alguno padece como evanglico, o como catlico,  o como mormn, o como Testigo de Jehov, o como adventista?    ?Por qu Agripa no dijo, por poco me persuades a ser anglicano, o bautista, o Pentecosts, o menonita, o metodista?    Sencillamente porque esos nombres que muchos llevan hoy, eran desconocidos por los apstoles y todos los discpulos de Cristo en el primer siglo. Y lo ms importante es que esos nombres NO son puestos por LA BOCA DE DIOS. La Biblia que es la revelacin de Dios da un nombre al seguidor de Cristo y ese nombre es CRISTIANO y segn la revelacin de Dios ese nombre es:    A) Nombre mejor.    B) Nombre perpetuo.    C) Nombre nuevo.    D) Nombre que nunca perecer.    E) Y nombre puesto por la boca de Dios.    S por obedecer el evangelio predicado por los apstoles, las personas del primer siglo llegaron a ser discpulos Cristo, y a su vez llegaron a ser a?adidos por Cristo a su iglesia y llamados por voluntad Divina CRISTIANOS, as tambin lo seremos nosotros si obedecemos el evangelio que los apstoles de Cristo predicaron.    Cuando Agripa dijo al apstol Pablo por poco me persuades a ser cristiano, el apstol de Cristo respondi Quisiera Dios que por poco o por mucho, no solamente t, sino tambin todos los que hoy me oyen, fueseis hechos tales cual yo soy, excepto estas cadenas (Hechos 26:29).     ?Qu era Pablo? ?Sera acaso un mormn? ?Acaso un adventista? O ?Un bautista? O quizs un ?catlico? ?Qu era l? ?l era un CRISTIANO!    Usted tambin puede ser un cristiano tal y cual era el apstol Pablo, l no era un cristiano - catlico o cristiano  evanglico, pues, eso y ms sera un agregado puesto por el hombre al nombre que Dios puso a sus discpulos. Pero usted puede llevar solamente el nombre de CRISTIANO, si obedece el evangelio que predicaron los apstoles de Cristo.    Los apstoles predicaron el evangelio que el Se?or les mando a predicar, y este evangelio contiene las condiciones que cada persona que cree debe obedecer para convertirse en discpulo de Cristo (Mateo 28:19,20). Hoy estas mismas condiciones las encontramos en el Nuevo Testamento.    Y, ?Cuales son esas condiciones que ellos siempre predicaron y que nosotros debemos obedecer?     1- Or el evangelio, pues la fe viene del or (Romanos 10:17).  2- Creer en Jesucristo (Juan 3:16; 8:24).  3- Arrepentirse de los pecados (Hechos 2:38; 17:30).  4- Confesar su fe en Jess (Romanos 10:9,10; Mateo 10:32)  5- Ser sepultado con Cristo por medio del bautismo (Colosenses 2:12; Romanos 6:4; Marcos 16:16; Hechos 2:38).    Luego el Se?or le a?adir a la iglesia que el fundo (Hechos 2:47), y usted ser su discpulo, y ser llamado con un nombre nuevo de parte de Dios, y ese nombre nuevo que l le dar es CRISTIANO, ?No desea ser hecho usted un CRISTIANO tal y cual lo eran los apstoles de Cris|`|b355975e9a10cd23874368d3b584ed77aa	MIRA  EN EL  MUNDO  HAY   MILES  D E RELIGIONES  Y  SECTAS  NI  SE  DIGA   ,TODO  AQUEL  HOMBRE  O MUJER  Q  POR  DECEOS  DE EGOLATRIA  QUIERE SER VISTO  Y  SER  VANAGLORIADO   MUCHAS   VECES  CAE  EN  CONFUCCION  Y  JUNTA GRUPOS  DCE GENTE  SIN  CONOCIMIENTO  Y  LOS  ENGA?A  CON  DOGMATISMOS ,FILOSOFIAS RELIGIOSAS,LOS  CUALE S DICEN  Q  SON PRACTICANTES  DE ALGUNA DOTRINA ,  QUE   NI  ELLOS MISMOS  VIVEN ,  MENOS  PROCTICAN   ,SE   DEBE  TENER  CUIDADO  CON  ESOS  FALSOS  MAESTROS .ESOS  SON  DECEOS  DE LA CARNE  CORRETO,Y  ESO  Q  TIENE  RESPALDO  BIBLICO  LO  QUE DICES .

AA11103974	Funny sort of school you go to...|`|AA10781920	Yup. What details would you like? Are you looking for people who have experimented in the bedroom, or lived the lifestyle?  ----  The way I see it, there are basically two ways people experience BDSM, and I'm not talking top and bottom though that's part of it. There are the couples who exchange roles and for whom the domination aspect is more about controlling the scenario they've created than it is about actually controlling their partner, and visa versa. In a situation where you're controlling the scene, you may also control your partner (give them directions, etc.) but that's not the actual point of what you're doing. In the opposite situation, where you're controlling your partner, and that is the goal of the exercise, you will also necessarily control the scene.    For me, personally, BDSM is more about trust than pain. The top asks for and receives the trust and cooperation of the bottom. In every relationship I've been in that practiced this, the bottom actually has more power in the dynamic, because they have (ideally, sometimes things get out of hand) the ability to stop everything by revoking their trust.    If you need more details feel free to ask via email.|`|AA11311749	Get into some bdsm blogs, that will be a better place to research it.    Some speciality stores have sections where customers can describe why they like the products they bought.    Don't have too much fun with the project.

I know that the Palestinians used to love the US, until too many American-made missiles were launched by Israel into their living rooms (literally).

Even the moderate people are filled with hate and disgust for the US.

Another factor is the US having bases in Saudi Arabia.  They don't like foreigners in their territory.  Not to mention, they really don't like our way of life.

El amante satisface o trata de satisfacer a la otra parte totalmente, y si la mujer o el hombre, es decir, el esposo (a), no logra satisfacer sexualmente a su pareja de echo que aburrir a su pareja. cosa que no pasa con el amante, con el amante todo es perfecto , bello, limpio, es una parejita feliz con la que no hay problemas solo comprensin y satisfaccin en la cama, pero con la pareja no siempre es as, y aburre.  He visto casos en que los amantes han terminado juntos pero la relacin se fue al diablo, no es lo mismo vivir juntos que por momentos.

e7a26fc54daba7c8c330b79380e74c3faa	As in literally - you take 7 days to mean  actual 7 24 hour time periods.    You fail to see the parable and metaphors, you believe fully in the book of revaltions that it will be EXACTLY as it says it is.    You don't take into context the teller of the stories - the various books being written by different men with different agendas. You don't take into context the time period - look at the 613 laws in the OT - all good, practical, common sense for that time - especially the food ones.    You honestly believe that a mighty dragon will come kill the world.    That is literal - instead of seeking the deeprr meanings inherent throughout the bible, you see only the shallow surface and never look for the truer meanings, the real meanings.|`|696ab48324d07c9880e5598c2ef06cc6aa	Generally that a 7 day creation, Noah's Ark, Virgin Birth - all really happened.

It isn't symbolic or allegorical, it is meant to be taken as it is.  So if you take the bible literally you believe God really did create the world in six days, and that Noah really did build a huge boat and put two of every animal on it.

Dream interpretation relies heavily on the beliefs of the individual be it cultural/religious/spiritual.    Personally, I find Wicca is too airy fairy, i don't wanna upset the light but turning off the bulb mentality.|`|AA11755204	It's about as accurate as making crap up.|`|d2a383c39b3b208bfabae696fef5a7e7aa	its probably because wiccans in general have more interest in that kind of thing than the rest of the population.|`|db112c469dc2812e36a266cb44078636aa	Personally I find Jung most accurate for dream interpretation.

Havent even seen what it looks like inside, and I hope I never have to.     Id rather pay a higher price than give money to those hypocrites.|`|AA10781920	Yup.

AA10344352	Hey, not sure I care for the question so much but that part about Jesus being in hell to pull people's fingernails out is a bit of an eye-opener.  You go, Christians!    Yes, I find people's inability and stubborn unwillingness even to explore, even within their minds, where facts and knowledge end and belief begins quite puzzling.  But people don't come here to learn anything, they only want validation of their POV (though, again, the Christ in Hell picture is a new one for me - I've learned something).|`|AA11002471	You speak adroitly.  However, please do not confuse Christendom with Christianity.  They are polar opposites.|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	I really wonder why people like you feel so uncomfortable with their own beliefs that you have to go around bashing and discrediting what others believe in just because you don't "get it".

I don't mind the idea that people believe in something that cannot be proved if that brings them sufficient satisfaction.  You can't prove that a lot of concepts exist, yet they bring comfort just the same.  (Love, for example.  We cannot truly explain nor comprehend it, yet many of us would die for it.)    It's when believers insist that their beliefs are FACT, and that you are blind and foolish for not seeing it, that I have to go hide in a closet for a while until my brain stops hurting.    .|`|b84034a930dc95309d8b8e54f3e19191aa	It isn't illogical,but yes it is faith based.    Jesus did die for your sins and mine.|`|2616fab19d0dc79ed6fab6e554cc31e5aa	There is nothing illogical about Christianity.  In fact, it makes all the sense in the world.  To believe that all we know came from nothing, and  some day we'll make the world a better place is illogical.|`|bf06012908ab85145bed9b3da21b74a6aa	Why do you care what others say,do you ponder your own death without Christ? why do you waste your time with Christians?

It's illogical because human beings have a limited capacity for intelligence, and its faith based because it's, um, religion. This is only funny because humans have a really difficult time seeing outside of their own time and space and reasoning.     It is true that Jesus died according to Christianity. However, people's personal beliefs cannot change Truth. And since we can only know the Truth through faith, it is impossible to explain the Truth of Christianity to a non-christian without faith on their part.     Find something better to do than laugh out loud at others beliefs.|`|AA10123828	Please name one thing about theism that is illogical and I'll gladly concede. Theism is, 100%, within the bounds of logic. Prove to me otherwise.    Red Eye Agnostic: How do I comment directly to yours?  (I don't know where to click so I'll just modify my reponse)...    Do you know the bounds of logic? How can you say that those things are beyond logic? There have been many things in the past that humans deemed miracles when science later proved them completely feasible. Would you disagree? Not to mention that because you do not understand the limits of logic, something could very well occur and Red Eye Agnostic calls it ridiculous when God is simply just showing you again that what we think are limits---and are limits for us---are certainly not limits for Him. Anyway, it just shows that religious peoples believe things that are beyond our reasoning power---which does have limits---while atheists/agnostics refuse to think they're fallible and will not accept that they have a Creator who is. It's merely a difference in opinion but don't say it's illogical. Was quantum physics in line with what we knew of logic at the time major discoveries were being made in it?|`|d094c3f28202679a8e0db424e2d8a346aa	Who said Christianity is illogical?  Of course it is faith based, but that does not mean that we abandon reason to become a Christian.  Jesus told us to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and mind.  That means that I am allowed to think through my decision, based on verifiable facts, and accept or reject based on the evidence.  My heart cannot rejoice in what my mind has rejected.  Faith comes in when we are talking about the basis of salvation - which cannot come by reasoning.  So even though I can make an intelligent decision about the claims of Christ with my mind, if I do not exercise faith in what His sacrifice has done for me, than have nothing more than a set of religious facts and beliefs, but no life-change.  The Bible has proven to be accurate and reliable, historically and archeologically, and passes the test for genuiness and authenticity in a much greater way than any other book of antiquity.  Those who claim it is illogical are those who have not honestly examined the evidence or who approach religion with a presupposition that precludes them from being able to see past their on bias.|`|fe0e63d1e7af32f88ee840630f995620aa	Sure religion is illogical depending upon who is defining logical.  A lot of it also depends upon experience.  For example, if an angle came down to me and my friend, spoke to us, did amazing things, and the two of us could confirm to each other that it happened it would not be illogical for us to believe in angles.  On the other hand, if you never saw an angle you might say that it is illogical to believe in angles.

FORCE yourself to be positive and think about something you have done in life that is good and then, think about what would have happened had you not been there to do that. how many people would that have affected? more than you can think of probably.     good luck!|`|b16715ae4ce56521de80a0bf60d807c4aa	Because tomorrow is gonna be a better day..

Christmas is about celebrating the birth of the "savior".      The modern understanding/social meaning of Christmas is directly linked to capitalism.  It's about giving gifts and receiving gifts, having very little to do with Jesus at all.  But that is still not what Christmas is, just a different understanding/interpretation that is incorrectly associated with what Christmas IS, in reality.      I see this problem as Christmas vs. Giftmas.    And in response to the belief that Jesus was born at some other date is completely true, but there are a LOT of different opinions out there as to when.  Some people say between June and October, whereas other believe the end of March.  Jesus was probably not even born in AD 0.  It's all kind of up in the air.  The Bible isn't exactly a great source for the exact date of the birth of Jesus, as the Bible was written years and years after Jesus died.      In my opinion, anyway, the Bible is more of a literary approach to the whole thing than any kind of literal account.

It was given to magicians who studied the stars and the zodiac signs. The star then guided them to the king that wanted Jesus killed and the king told the 'three wise men' to find the baby and tell him where he was so the king could have him killed. Then the star led them to Jesus. After they left Jesus, an angel had to appear to the three to tell them not to go back to the king and tell him where Jesus was.    These men were not Jews, which were 'God's people' at that time. God did not use pagans for such purposes. God strictly forbid the studying of the stars for signs and omens. The star was working in a way to lead death to the baby Jesus. Part of the gifts given to the baby was inscense, which was illegal to use by 'God's people' unless you were a priest and was in the temple, even then it had to be a certain kind.    It is obvious to see that the star was a sign from the devil used to lure pagans to Jesus so that the king could kill him. That's why the angel had to step in and stop them. That's why the star did not go directly to Jesus but stopped where the king was first.     The story has also been used by the devil to manipulate the truth and help establish a pagan holiday in the midst of Christianity that is based on lies and misconceptions. These pagan magicians are now idols right beside the baby in the manger and his mother.     So yes, this is the true meaning of Christmas, lies and misconceptions of paganistic traditions.|`|3764ddf08dc5c640d7c4b821882b2b3eaa	Correct.

13fcbb23eb0c05bd8cdec5d71f9e65d2aa	Here's the information that might help you.  No personal experience, though.    Etherium Technology was formed in 1995 upon the discovery of a white mineral deposit near one of earth's high-energy vortex sites in the Shasta Mountain matrix of northern California. The deposit is believed to be the result of a metorite hit/implosion over 200,000 years ago.    This geological event produced Etherium Gold, also known as white gold powder or monatomic gold. This unique natural mineral exhibits extraordinary properties that strengthen and stabilize the electromagnetic fields of the human body and has become the basis of research for scientists at Etherium Technology - what we call the Science of Electromagnatheria. Their findings may explain why the ancients used these sacred vortex sites for spiritual transformation and healing.  The story of the unique discovery of this sacred white powder and subsequent journey into a whole new realm of science is most fascinating:    Patrick Bailey is a well known nutritional research specialist and product developer for the supplement industry. He is perhaps best known as former co-founder and Vice President of Rainbow Light Nutritional Systems, a very successful and well-respected supplement company. Under Patrick's guidance, Rainbow Light was the first company to introduce the concept of food-base supplements. Back in 1983, the predominant thought process for product design in the entire industry was simply mega-dose, mega-dose and more mega-dose of U.S.P. chemical nutrients.    Patrick's concept of superfoods that are combined with U.S.P. nutrients and herbs was revolutionary. Today, there is not one supplement company that does not mimic this idea. So in a very real sense,            Patrick played a major role in shifting the direction of the supplement industry    by pioneering the concept of food-base supplements. Prior to his work at Rainbow Light, Patrick developed one of his most well-known creations, "The Wellness Formula". It is Source Natural's  1 seller, and the premiere cold and flu formula in health food stores for over fourteen years.    A few years ago, Patrick learned of a Native American woman who was using an herb from her land in the Sierra mountains. A professional associate of Patrick's reported that this woman had been getting extraordinary results with AIDS and other serious conditions over the course of many years. Having been in product research for over 15 years, Patrick was very skeptical of claims such as these, since he had grown accustomed to hearing wonderful stories about products, only to find out through further investigation that the claims were usually exaggerated.    Several weeks later, a friend of Patrick's had a direct experience with a person who had used the herb to dramatically recover from his bout with AIDS. Impressed with this new information, Pat obtained samples of both the herb and a white mineral deposit around which the herb grew. Interestingly, he discovered that this same species of herb grows throughout the Sierra mountains, but the Native American woman's plants, growing near the white mineral deposit, were much more abundant and 2-3 times larger than normal.    Patrick was immediately interested in the white mineral, since, as coincidence would have it, he had recently become aware of David Hudson's work in monatomic elements which generally came from white mineral powders. Reportedly,            these monatomic elements could act as superconductors on the DNA of the cell having both profound health benefits as well as spiritual shifts in consciousness.    Also, coincidentally, Patrick had just learned about a lab that specialized in electromagnetic analysis of organic compounds. Upon analysis of his samples, the lab reported back that they had never before encountered such an extraordinary substance with such magnificent electromagnetic properties.    Understandably, he began to believe he had something special, but felt it required further analysis. Being a researcher, Patrick arranged for a variety of tests to be done on the white mineral powder. The tests include microbiological, ICP-MS analysis, and acute toxicology. The tests confirmed some of the unusual characteristics of the mineral deposit, and found it to be beneficial to humans in small amounts as a supplement.    Additionally, the powder was tested for the presence of monatomic elements. The results are as follows:    Monatomic Analysis:        * Gold = 94 ppm      * Silver = 178 ppm      * Iridium = 24 ppm      * Rhodium = 15 ppm      * Platinum = 78 ppm      * Chromium = 225 ppm     Results obtained from laser spectrophotometric neutron activation.|`|b7a7172f5b31e775787e2cc660023b6faa	Wrong section    I will ring your doorbell and run away!!!|`|568f768fe0160ab2a5bd1f04e0bc7fb9aa	I know nothing about it.

Isso n?o significa que a pessoa vai ser grossa em tudo, mas falar e rir alto n?o  educado.    Isso porque voc invade o espa?o das outras pessoas. Voc tem que falar s no volume suficiente para que a pessoa para quem voc est falando te ou?a. Sen?o voc obriga todo mundo a participar de uma conversa que n?o tem nada a ver com elas.

Yes, religion does play a role in what you say to them.  If they are saved then usually they're not scared and you can talk with them about the joy of going to heaven.  If they're not, a lot of them (in my experience) were very sad and scared, cried a lot.  Death is SUCH a hard thing to deal with.|`|a426267a145cd523a2b4d17d607e3822aa	Yes.  When my grandmother was dying, I volunteered to stay with her so she wouldn't be alone.  I think the most important thing you can do for them to listen to what they have to say.  I think that when they know there isn't much time left.. .they tend to want to get things of their chests.  Some of it may not make much sense to you at the time, but remember it becuase it might make sense to you later on.|`|0e0d6dddc51d8dd334cb6b1612bc9b0eaa	never not even when my father was dying|`|AA11491405	Yes and no.

The Observer: Kenya bishop leads anti-evolution fight    According to secular media accounts, well-meaning clergy are putting up a fight over the display of a fossil collection at the National Museum of Kenya. The collection includes a variety of pieces of alleged apemen, including those of the 4 million-year-old apeman, Australopithecus anamensis, the 1.5 million-year-old remains of the Nariokotome boy  and a series of other bones that highlight crucial phases of our evolutionary past.    Bishop Boniface Adoyo, one of the clergy, was quoted to say that the fossils are a big weapon against Christianity thats killing our faith  [w]hen children go to museums theyll start believing we evolved from these apes.    On one hand, we agree with Bishop Adoyo that evolutionary indoctrinationwhich comes through both public schools and museumsis a danger to children and can result in a fatalistic mindset (and the consequences of such a mindset) when students accept that life is just an accident. But while we oppose evolutionary indoctrination, we do not believe students should be prevented from hearing the sad story of evolutionas long as they are exposed to the whole story,evolution warts and all. When both interpretations of the evidence are presented, the lack of support for molecules-to-man evolution may lead people to see that the Bible does make sense!|`|AA10458548	not only can they get dumb, but dumber and dangerous.. they want every one stupid and blind so they can't see all the lies the religion is based on|`|AA10248519	fossils cannot speak.

People who believe in the false doctrine of the immortality of the soul think that when a person dies, he/she goes to heaven to become an angel.  This is not true.  People will be resurrected on the last day, not before, and especially not right after they die.  Also, people will be resurrected to earth to live forever in a paradise. Just like God intended for us to do in the first place. That is why the bible says that righteous people will live on earth forever.    Matt. 6:10: Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.    Ps. 37:29: The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.    See also Ecclesiastes 1:4; Psalm 104:5.    The Hebrew Scriptures had never led faithful Jews to expect a reward of heavenly life. Those Scriptures pointed to the restoration of Paradise here on earth. Daniel 7:13,?14 had foretold that when rulership and dignity and kingdom would be given to the Messiah, the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. Those subjects of the Kingdom would be here on the earth. By what he said to Jesus, the evildoer was evidently expressing the hope that Jesus would remember him when that time came.    How, then, would Jesus be with the evildoer? By raising him from the dead, making provision for his physical needs, and extending to him the opportunity to learn and conform to Gods requirements for eternal life. (John 5:28,?29) Jesus saw in the evildoers repentant and respectful attitude a basis for including him among the billions who will be resurrected to earthly life and the opportunity to prove their worthiness to live forever in Paradise.

If someone comes from the skies doing things which appear to be magical to a primitive mind, what would a primitive mind call them? Gods or angels. Today we'd call them aliens. if you look at all the stories and myths of every culture and civilization you would see similar stories of people from the skies. The evidence is there, just look. But God is real and those that serve Him are His angels. The angels who don't call themselves gods. Some angels did not claim to be gods but were called gods anyway.

Then one day after a few years of an abusive relationship, I heard a voice telling me to leave and never go back. It said I was worth more than I was receiving. So I left, found God and never went back to the loser. That is the key. My sister stayed in an abusive relationship until he almost killed her...she went back to him 3 times before she finally woke up and listened to the voice telling her to leave.

If they don't want to be around you anymore, though, then they're not worth the time to begin with.    However, if, to maintain the friendship, you have to put your feelings for them aside, I would suggest just giving yourself time to deal and recover from the emotional roller-coaster. There is no instant heart-ache cure.. you just have to go through the motions, and do the best you can to take care of yourself.    Best of luck!  lucy

4f0cd81d2ec75d84539080d16c5944b7aa	In the history of science, alchemy refers to both an early form of the investigation of nature and an early philosophical and spiritual discipline, both combining elements of chemistry, metallurgy, physics, medicine, astrology, semiotics, mysticism, spiritualism, and art. Alchemy has been practiced in Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Persia, India, and China, in Classical Greece and Rome, in Muslim civilization, and then in Europe up to the 19th centuryin a complex network of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2500 years.    Western alchemy has always been closely connected with Hermeticism, a philosophical and spiritual system that traces its roots to Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic Egyptian-Greek deity and legendary alchemist. These two disciplines influenced the birth of Rosicrucianism, an important esoteric movement of the seventeenth century. In the course of the early modern period, mainstream alchemy evolved into modern chemistry.    The concept of a homunculus (Latin for "little man", sometimes spelled "homonculus," plural "homunculi") is often used to illustrate the functioning of a system.    and now  Homunculus of Alchemy-    The term appears to have been first used by the alchemist Paracelsus. He once claimed that he had created a false human being that he referred to as the homunculus. The creature was to have stood no more than 12 inches tall, and did the work usually associated with a golem. However, after a short time, the homunculus turned on its creator and ran away. The recipe consisted of a bag of bones, sperm, skin fragments and hair from any animal of which the homunculus would be a hybrid. This was to be laid in the ground surrounded by horse manure for forty days, at which point the embryo would form.    In Carl Jung's studies of Alchemy, he believed the first recording of a homunculus in Alchemical literature appeared in the Visions of Zosimos, written in the third century A.D, although the actual word "homunculus" was never said. In the visions, Zosimos mentions encountering a man who impales him with a sword, and then undergoes "unendourable torment," his eyes become blood, he spews fourth his flesh, and changes into "the opposite of himself, into a mutilated anthroparion, and he tore his flesh with his own teeth, and sank into himself," which is a rather grotesque personification of the uroboros, the dragon that bites it own tail [which represents the dyophysite nature in alchemy: the balance of two principles. Zosimos later encounters several other homunculi, named as the Brazen Man, the Leaden Man, and so fourth. Commonly, the homunculi "submit themselves to unendourable torment" and undergo alchemic transformation. Zosimos made no mention of actually creating an artificial human, but rather used the concept of personifying inanimate metals to further explore alchemy.    There are also variants cited by other alchemists. One such variant involved the use of the mandrake. Popular belief held that this plant grew where semen ejaculated by hanged men (during the last convulsive spasms before death) fell to the ground, and its roots vaguely resemble a human form to varying degrees. The root was to be picked before dawn on a Friday morning by a black dog, then washed and "fed" with milk and honey and, in some prescriptions, blood, whereupon it would fully develop into a miniature human which would guard and protect its owner. Yet a third method, cited by Dr. David Christianus at the University of Giessen during the 18th century, was to take an egg laid by a black hen, poke a tiny hole through the shell, replace a bean-sized portion of the white with human sperm, seal the opening with virgin parchment, and bury the egg in dung on the first day of the March lunar cycle. A miniature humanoid would emerge from the egg after thirty days, which would help and protect its creator in return for a steady diet of lavender seeds and earthworms.|`|7d30b5484f93cdfe173bd27368dff7b6aa	The Alchemists    To most of us, the word "alchemy" calls up the picture of a medieval and slightly sinister laboratory in which an aged, black-robed wizard broods over the crucibles and alembics that are to bring within his reach the Philosopher's Stone, and with that discovery, the formula for the Elixir of life and the transmutation of metals. But one can scarcely dismiss so lightly the science -- or art, if you will --that won to its service the lifelong devotion of men of culture and attainment from every race and clime over a period of thousands of years, for the beginnings of alchemy are hidden in the mists of time. Such a science is something far more than an outlet for a few eccentric old men in their dotage.    What was the motive behind their constant strivings, their never-failing patience in the unravelling of the mysteries, the tenacity of purpose in the face of persecution and ridicule through the countless ages that led the alchemists to pursue undaunted their appointed way? Something far greater, surely, than a mere vainglorious desire to transmute the base metals into gold, or to brew a potion to prolong a little longer this earthly span, for the devotees of alchemy in the main cared little for such things.    The accounts of their lives almost without exception lead us to believe that they were concerned with things spiritual rather than with things temporal. They were men inspired by a vision, a vision of man made perfect, of man freed from disease and the limitations of warring faculties both mental and physical, standing godlike in the realization of a power that even at this very moment of time lies hidden in the deeper strata of consciousness, a vision of man made truly in the image and likeness of the One Divine Mind in its Perfection, Beauty, and Harmony.    To appreciate and understand the adepts' visions, it is necessary to trace the history of their philosophy. So let us for step back into the past to catch a glimpse of these men, of their work and ideals, and more important still, of the possibilities that their life-work might bring to those who today are seeking for fuller knowledge and wider horizons.    Chinese Alchemy    References about alchemy are to be found in the myths and legends of ancient China. From a book written by Edward Chalmers Werner, a late member of the Chinese Government's Historiological Bureau in Peking comes this quotation from old Chinese records: "Chang Tao-Ling, the first Taoist pope, was born in A.D. 35 in the reign of the Emperor Kuang Wu Ti of the Hari dynasty. His birthplace is variously given as T'ien-mu Shan, Lin-an-Hsien in Chekiang, Feng-yang Fu in Anhui, and even in the "Eye of Heaven Mountain." He devoted himself wholly to study and meditation, declining all offers to enter the service of the state. He preferred to take up his abode in the mountains of Western China where he persevered in the study of alchemy and in cultivating the virtues of purity and mental abstraction. From the hands of the alchemist Lao Tzu, he received supernaturally a mystical treatise, by following the instructions in which he was successful in his match for the Elixir of Life." This reference demonstrates that alchemy was studied in China before the commencement of the Christian era and its origin must lie even further back in Chinese history.    Egyptian Alchemy    From China we now travel to Egypt, from where alchemy as it is known in the West seems to have sprung. The great Egyptian adept king, named by the Greeks "Hermes Trismegistus" is thought to have been the founder of the art. Reputed to have lived about 1900 B.C., he was highly celebrated for his wisdom and skill in the operation of nature, but of the works attributed to him only a few fragments escaped the destroying hand of the Emperor Diocletian in the third century A.D. The main surviving documents attributed to him are the Emerald Tablet, the Asclepian Dialogues, and the Divine Pymander. If we may judge from these fragments (both preserved in the Latin by Fianus and translated into other languages in the sixteenth century), it would seem to be of inestimable loss to the world that none of these works have survived in their entirety.    The famous Emerald Tablet (Tabula Smaragdina) of Hermes is the primary document of alchemy. There have been various stories of the origin of the tract, one being that the original emerald slab upon which the precepts were said to be inscribed in Phoenician characters was discovered in the tomb of Hermes by Alexander the Great. In the Berne edition (1545) of the Summa Perfectionis, the Latin version is printed under the heading: "The Emerald Tables of Hermes the Thrice Great Concerning Chymistry, Translator unknown. The words of the secrets of Hermes, which were written on the Tablet of Emerald found between his hands in a dark cave wherein his body was discovered buried."    Arabian Alchemy    An Arabic version of the text was discovered in a work ascribed to Jabir (Geber), which was probably made about the ninth century. In any case, it must be one of the oldest alchemical fragments known, and that it is a piece of Hermetic teaching I have no doubt, as it corresponds to teachings of the Thrice-Greatest Hermes as they have been passed down to us in esoteric circles. The tablet teaches the unity of matter and the basic truth that all form is a manifestation from one root, the One Thing or Ether. This tablet, in conjunction with the works of the Corpus Hermeticum are well worth reading, particularly in the light of the general alchemical symbolism. Unhappily, the Emerald Tablet is all that remains to us of the genuine Egyptian sacred art of alchemy.    The third century A.D. seems to have been a period when alchemy was widely practiced, but it was also during this century, in the year 296, that Diocletian sought out and burnt all the Egyptian books on alch|`|4dce65d4eeca24640c2612e2fa132521aa	This is for jayaraman:    I am impressed....Did you do all this research for this question or did you know all this before hand.... i would love to learn more about this and you.... please email me.... thanks...    to the asker... i think your question has already been answered... i dont know anything more to add to it... all the best...

God Almighty... a cluster of pure energy is but the sum total of all souls (atmans) in the cosmos at a given point of time. The essence of every soul (atman) being the same as God Almighty... every soul is but a minuscule God in its entity.    The moment the big bang occurs... all souls (atmans) existing in the Cosmos spread all over the cosmos with unimaginable speeds. The magnitude and the scale of the big bang are beyond the comprehension of the human beings to visualize. Nothing that exists in the cosmos in energy form can be visualized by the help of the senses and the mind.    This explosion of the big bang results in creation of a new cosmos... a new beginning! After billions of years when some planets become suitable for giving birth to life... the souls start manifesting body after another. And a planet like Mother Earth is born.    Now... what is this big bang theory! The big bang occurs in what! As has been defined above... the definition of God is, "the sum total of all purified souls atmans in the cosmos at a given point of time is what we know as God Almighty".    This cluster of pure energy we know as God accumulates in its absolute pure state only when the dissolution of the Cosmos occurs in its entirety. It is as if a huge cauldron of fire... a massive black hole has reduced the whole of the Cosmos to the size of half a thumb. It is this stage when every single soul atman in the Cosmos in whatever stage of life it may be liberates after gaining enlightenment and salvation. There is just no escape for the collapse of the whole of Cosmos has occurred.    As has been expressed by Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism that souls atmans in whatever stage of life they may be... continue their journey into the next Cosmos exactly from the point where they stood in the earlier manifestation is totally wrong. This is where the teachings of Jainism are flawed.    Bhagavad Gita... the sacred doctrine of Lord Krishna distinctly clarifies this point. And it is logical that when the collapse of the entire cosmos occurs... the question of souls remaining in their position as such and transitioning into the next Cosmos after the big bang occurs is but a flawed parable that defies all reasoning and logic.    The point of difference where Mahavira went wrong in understanding the teachings of Bhagavad Gita! The reason why Jainism branched into a new thinking pattern as advocated and doctored by Bhagwan Mahavira (the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism) is evidenced here.      This cluster of pure energy... the sum total of all purified atmans in the Cosmos equals half the size of a thumb as has been clearly spelt out in the Bhagavad Gita... the most sacred doctrine put forward by Lord Krishna in the battlefield of Mahabharata.    Unable to contain itself for long... this enormous source of pure energy explodes with a big bang giving birth to a new cosmos... a new journey! God Almighty is the source and the cause of the big bang. This theory of creationism is unpalatable by Scientists all over the world. Why? Science demands proofs and in the kingdom of God... it is absolute faith (in the system of God) that rules.    To be able to visualize the system of God... the kingdom of God with the help of the senses and the mind is being hypothetical. It is just not possible! The prime reason why the kingdom of God and God Almighty himself is beyond the capture of all scientists of the world!    Albert Einstein was the only scientist in the world who tried studying Bhagavad Gita at the fag end of his life. He deeply regretted and resented not having ventured into the study of Bhagavad Gita in the earlier stages of his life. In a nutshell... the domain of God starts where science ends. This is in brief the definition of God Almighty!    If a grain of sand is an individual soul atman... the whole mound of sand is Parmatman (Almighty God). If a single block of the puzzle is an individual soul atman... the whole completed puzzle is God Almighty himself in its fully magnificence and cosmic glory.

That is a question you will have to answer for yourself. Consider these possibilities, however. Do you at times feel envious of other males? Do you feel unloved, unwanted? Do you think you are less handsome, less attractive, less popular than your peers? Do you feel lacking in power or influence? Are you feeling somewhat low on the pecking order of life among your peers? Well maybe that will give you something to work with as a starter. Probably though you would do well to seek out a therapist trained in these matters.

THE book of Ecclesiastes was written for a lofty purpose. Solomon, as leader of a people dedicated to God, had the responsibility to hold them together in faithfulness to their dedication. He sought to fulfill this responsibility by means of the wise counsel of Ecclesiastes.    In Ecclesiastes 1:1 he refers to himself as "the congregator." The word in the Hebrew language is Qoheleth, and in the Hebrew Bible, the book is given that name. The Greek Septuagint gives the title as Ekklesiastes, meaning "a member of an ecclesia (congregation; assembly)," from which is derived the English name Ecclesiastes. However, Qoheleth is more aptly translated "The Congregator," and this is also a more fitting designation for Solomon. It conveys Solomon's purpose in writing the book.    He was a congregator of his people, the Israelites, and of their companions, the temporary residents. He congregated all of these to the worship of his God, Jehovah. Previously he had built Gods temple in Jerusalem, and at its dedication he had called together, or congregated, all of them to the worship of God. (1 Ki. 8:1) Now, by means of Ecclesiastes, he sought to congregate his people to worthwhile works and away from the vain, fruitless works of this world.-Eccl. 12:8-10.      CONTENTS OF ECCLESIASTES    The vanity of man's way of life (1:1-3:22). The opening words sound the theme of the book: "'The greatest vanity!' the congregator has said, 'the greatest vanity! Everything is vanity!'" What profit is there in mankind's toil and labor? Generations come and go, the natural cycles repeat on earth, and "there is nothing new under the sun." (1:2, 3, 9) The congregator has set his heart to seek and explore wisdom with regard to the calamitous occupations of the sons of men, but he finds that in wisdom and in folly, in exploits and in hard work, in eating and in drinking, everything is "vanity and a striving after wind." He comes to 'hate life,' a life of calamity and materialistic pursuits.-1:14; 2:11, 17.    For everything there is an appointed time-yes, God has 'made everything pretty in its time.' He wants his creatures to enjoy life on earth. "I have come to know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during one's life; and also that every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work. It is the gift of God." But, alas! For sinful mankind there is the same eventuality as for the beasts: "As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit, so that there is no superiority of the man over the beast, for everything is vanity."-3:1, 11-13, 19.    Wise counsel for those who fear God (4:1-7:29). Solomon congratulates the dead, for they are free of "all the acts of oppression that are being done under the sun." Then he continues to describe vain and calamitous works. He also wisely counsels that "two are better than one" and that "a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn in two." (4:1, 2, 9, 12) He gives fine advice on the congregating of God's people: "Guard your feet whenever you go to the house of the true God; and let there be a drawing near to hear." Do not be hasty in speaking before God; let 'your words prove to be few,' and pay what you vow to God. "Fear the true God himself." When the poor are oppressed, remember that "one that is higher than the high one is watching, and there are those who are high above them." The mere servant, he observes, will have sweet sleep, but the rich man is too worried to sleep. Yet, he has come naked into the world, and for all his hard work, he can carry nothing out of the world.-5:1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 12, 15.    A man may receive riches and glory, but what is the use of living "a thousand years twice over" if he has not seen what is good? It is better to take to heart the serious issues of life and death than to associate with the stupid "in the house of rejoicing"; yes, better to receive the rebuke of the wise one, for as the crackling "sound of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the stupid one." Wisdom is advantageous. "For wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners." Why, then, has the way of mankind become calamitous? "The true God made mankind upright, but they themselves have sought out many plans."-6:6; 7:4, 6, 12, 29.    The one eventuality to all (8:1-9:12). "Keep the very order of the king," advises the congregator; but he observes that it is because sentence against bad work has not been executed speedily that "the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad." (8:2, 11) He himself commends rejoicing, but there is another calamitous thing! All kinds of men go the same way-to death! The consciousness of the living is that they will die, "but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all . . . All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going."-9:5, 10.    Practical wisdom and man's obligation (9:13-12:14). The congregator speaks of other calamities, such as "foolishness . . . in many high positions." He also sets forth many proverbs of practical wisdom, and he declares that even "youth and the prime of life are vanity"-unless true wisdom is heeded. He states: "Remember, now, your grand Creator in the days of your young manhood." Otherwise, old age will merely return one to the dust of the earth, to the accompaniment of the congregator's words: "The greatest vanity! . . . Everything is vanity." He himself has taught the people knowledge continually, for "the words of the wise ones are like oxgoads," spurring on to right works, but regarding worldly wisdom he warns: "To th

A Visual Diagram of the History of the New Testament Canon   http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ45.HTM|`|AA10897347	I think it was actually written last.|`|AA10058326	Irenaeus commented that John wrote after the first three Gospels. Clement of Alexandria (recorded by Eusebius) said that John wrote to supplement the writings of the other Gospels. Clement, writing from Rome in about A.D. 96 refers only to   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and 8 other New Testament books. So many tend to date John's Gospel in the 90's. However John's mention of the five porches of the pool called Bethesda at Jerusalem speaks of it in the present tense "is" (John 5:2), and we know Jerusalem was completely destroyed in Sept of 70AD.     What's more interesting is the gospel "according to John" is the only "verily verily" gospel account, the others being "verily". And in the gospel according to John Jesus plays two parts: Son of man and Son of God, with two resurrections mentioned.    What's even more interesting is the surname of John is Mark, and Luke's writings of Luke and Acts follow Mark and John; Perhaps as Luke notes, to set things in order, perhaps things out of order.    Let us remember every good mystery has twists to it, and the word "mystery" occurs over 20 times in the New Testament.    What's most interesting is Revelation is not written by John as many suppose, but by Paul, since it is sign-ified in Rev 22:21 with Paul's salutation, the token in every Pauline epistle written by his own hand, as told us thrice in 1Cor 16; Col 4; 2Thess 3.

Neckties  Though he may not like them, they should come in handy and can be bought for as much or as little as you want.  An added bonus is you can tailor it to the kind of gy he is ie  You can get a solid black tie, or a humorous novelty tie or anything in between.    Shaving Gear  Allot of guys, especially in college get in the habit of, in part because of the freedom, not shaving.  A nice gift is something in the area of shaving.  Again, as with ties, the cost of the Gift is up to you.  You can buy simple disposable Razors and Cream to Expensive electric Shavers, or for a Realy classy gift give a gift certificate for Art of Shaving.  Art of Shaving is a specialty shop that not only gives shaves but also teaches how to shave more correctly for each particular face.

AA11332227	There is nothing wrong with a gay man or lesbian appearing or acting 'straight'. I do think that for your friends to ask such a question indicates they are expecting a certain misguided sterotype of what they think a gay man should be.  In most cases it, gays act no different than most people do when they are with other people.   Even when you may act flamboyant or bitchy when you are with your gay friends, it is just common courtesy to be polite with mixed company and not try to force your 'gayness' on anyone.  Most straight men act entirely different when they are out with 'the boys' than when they are in the general public.  Unfortunately, in most places of work, it is still to your advantage to blend in if you wish to climb the corporate ladder. Besides, it is too hard to do when you're in heels.|`|73d79580fe9f019faf7a8cd24e9c9d9caa	Because she's ignorant.

There is no one "gay look." It is just an image that the media has made for gay men.. i.e. weak wrist-ed, effeminate guys, when there are a whole variety to what a gay person can be. Don't play into it, just be who you are.|`|964abab45bce589d73fa416e5855e106aa	He just means the stereotypical kind of gay guy. Most people think all gay guys are femmy and wear prada, gucci and other design labels, or at least are fashionistas to some extent. So when people find gay guy who act and dress just like "regular"(this in its self is a very loose and subjective word) then they are suprised. You shouldnt need to fit into any kind of stereotype to be who you are. There are str8 guys who hate sports, and gay guys who hate fashion. Amazing I know, but everyone is different. Some people have a hard time figuring this out.
4525399527ebb446b63be68dd81f3139aa	super great question. I think questioning death can inspire someone to live.     A: I would not have any regrets because even the mistakes I've made have taught me valuable lessons, no joke. I see the beauty even in the most ugliest parts of myself.     What would I regret? Intentionally causing harm to others and myself. I don't manipulate others to meet my desires...If I have wants I let them know and then I LISTEN to who they are and respect their wants. VS: scheming and plotting to get someone who doesn't want me.

Good luck!|`|a96880bf5ffe6feb382113fc36cc3e9daa	Better experience: Latin.  Important as one base of European and Western culture and civilization.    No experience with Mandarin. Since you have knowledge of Cantonese, why not go for Mandarin???    Either choice is a wonderful experience, fully worth the effort!!!    If you are really privileged, you will pursue both!!!|`|7b2d6c428c4aba4de0e941a48bb438c1aa	Take Mandarin.  Latin is essentially a dead language and while very useful for understanding the roots of words, etc., is not all that helpful once you graduate from school.  Mandarin, on the other hand, is spoken by the bulk of people in China, and with the opening of the economy there and ongoing focus on growing Pacific Rim businesses, the ability to speak Asian languages fluently will be immensely useful in the future.  It will lead to more opportunities (a non-Asian friend who took Chinese in high school was able to parlay that interest into a full scholarship at Duke!) for higher education as well as higher pay and in some cases make you a more attractive candidate for choice jobs post graduation.    Good luck!|`|958b3c9dfffbd359af24a34956241277aa	That is awesome.  I speak some Mandarin.  Beijing dialect which is standard.  I've heard from Mandarin speakers that Cantonese is tough.

I think that the only things that really "help" society are the things the reinforce our moral code--our moral sense--that helps us become better people.  Darwinism may or may not be terribly accurate in describing how homo sapiens came about.  But it surely doesn't answer any substantive moral questions.    So has it helped society much?  I doubt it.  If you want society's real gold mine for values and the like look to the Bible.|`|393e01bb16d22372c4281a7243744de6aa	Darwinism?  Isn't that the Theory of Evolution as opposed to the theory of Intelligent design as to how we ended up here?    How can any theory hurt or help society?  They're just words.      I think the bigger issue is do you need to have a supreme being to blame for our problems or can you deal with the fact that our problems are created by man and that no supreme being is going to step forward to save our asses?|`|8a26ffc3b2c6e599ae80b4f68568288baa	Absolutely!  But, let's distinguish between Darwinism and evolution.  Darwinism refers to Charles Darwin's recognition that evolution occurs (through a process of adaptation to environmental changes and natural selection) and leads to changes in the characteristics of species over time.  Evolution is a biological process that scientists have studied extensively for more than 100 years.  I point out the distinction between the two because things can exist even though people don't have the knowledge that they exist.  Ignorance and denial doesn't change the fact.  A person's desire for something not to be true (or true) doesn't necessarily change objective reality.  So, when you say Darwinism, I assume your asking whether or not our understanding of the process of evolution has helped society, not whether or not the process of evolution itself has actually helped society.  Suffice it to say, and this is a scientific take on things, which is based on data and not belief and opinion, society wouldn't exist at all without evolution.  However, back to your question, our understanding of evolution, based on Darwin's theory has led directly and indirectly to many of the important scientific and technological advances of the twentieth century.  Just about every field of science, including biology, psychology, neuroscience, anthropology, geology, etc., recognizes and takes for granted the fact that evolution occurs.  Despite what you hear in the media, it's not the scientists who are doing any sort of important work in their fields who doubt the importance of evolution, but rather people who oftentimes know little about the scientific method, the difference between fact and knowledge and belief and opinion.|`|ec86eda7f50c1a7cc657f2870f8ec377aa	I think he helped to confuse. Few people know that Darwin was a born again Christian at the time of his death.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Understanding the development of the human body helps us in medicine and science.|`|AA11974580	No|`|5220d75a1300551bc0e5a8de6aa97de6aa	Ginger, it doesn't matter if it helped or not, it is the truth. Has it helped society that the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening?|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Charles Darwin was a scientist who offered evidence supporting his theory of evolution.  I believe he "helped society" just as any other great thinker did by offering knowledge.  Of course, a lot of our society (can we say Christians?--I can say it, I'm one too!)  believe that Darwin is responisble only for his theory of how man evolved.  He also showed that animals evolve and there is a ton of evidence to back it up.

Jesus Christ came 2,000 years ago as the suffering servant.   When He comes again ("The Second Coming", Acts 1), He will return as the victorious ruler/king.

There are 2 "returns" that he mentioned. But they aren't seperate.  They are manifested differently.    One, he said that no one would pay attention to, in which he'd return invisibly, but he game one composite sign (Matthew 24) and that mankind would see the most evil days it had ever experienced.    "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. "For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. "For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,  and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be." - Matthew 24:36-39    (Some translations translate that Greek word for "coming" as "So the presence of the Son of Man will be")    During that time, as Matthew 24:6-21 mentions, the world would see unprecedented Wars, Famine, Earthquakes, Disease, and a simotaneous world wide preaching campaign.    Then, Matthew 24:21-34 takes place.  **During** this invisible presence, he exercises his authority as King of the Heavenly Kingdom.  A tribulation will occur such as this world has never seen.  This is at his VISIBLE "return", things would shift, and he would be visible to all.  At this time, he will usher in Gods Kingdom that he preached about on earth.  It will have already existed as a Kingdom in the heavens.  But now will be the time to totally take over earths affairs.    "In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever." - Daniel 2:44    Then, peace will be restored to the earth, and yes, famine, war, and all such ills will cease.

You do nothing but try to rip God apart.  You remind me (picture included) of Goliath who with the strength of God was killed with just one stone thrown by a little boy.  Now to answer your question, Jesus became the Christ when he came to earth.  Although he fed the hungry, cured the sick, raised the dead, at that time it was to show us what he would be capable of doing for us as our King.  Until he removes all wicked men from the earth (and mind you that time is very near) he will not repeat those miracles.

bab4291aa9fe9b05ec5c0536b923edfeaa	Honestly, this is lifes ultimate goal. We are raised to build walls to help protect us from the mean world.  I have very thick defensive walls. I am really probably 75%real and 25%b.s.   I NEVER LIE OUTRIGHT. I persuade, and manuver people into thinking something that is not always true. I play with gray areas that do not always exist except. I never purposely miscommunicate on anything that is important.    It has become a game that me and my friends play.   I am a very real person, until it comes to the game.|`|df996fd73f33d48c279fe375bbabbe51aa	I think I'm rather real.  I mean, I live, breathe, think, eat, walk, learn, sleep, and all that.  So tangibly I'm very much real.      But if you want a percentage, how about, say, ahhh, .......98% real and 2% fake?  Or perhaps since that was made up, does that make me 100% fake?  Or since I'm here typing this, I am 100% real?  Or maybe that makes me fake as you said earlier?      Lets go with a tie then.  50-50.|`|b8e196946a33b64918a5f00f8f53ab72aa	Well, let's see...I'm made of flesh, blood, bone, cartilage and have all my organs in place.  I've never been augmented or had an amputation.  But I do wear corrective lenses because my eyes don't work as well as they should.  That accounts for, what?  2%?  So I'm 98% real.    EDIT:  I don't know what it has to do with being real or not, but I'm closer to my family.|`|e40e6997c76f0531ce3e3b8826cc915eaa	I'm about 99% real- If people don't like me for me I truly don't care. And I'm closest with my friends- they are my real family.|`|AA10781920	WTF?|`|6ea6b0e4a9cfa1efee733f6800b83a0eaa	Everyone is fake to a certain extent. I would guess I'm about the same as you in terms of percentage. Maybe 30% fake.    In a way, I'm more real with strangers because I care less what they think.|`|ad0f0ea09f258444a6e7e9dda02e754aaa	No one is 100% real. I am 95% real though. I am one of those people who says what she thinks and stands behind what she says. I am closer to family and friends of course. You cannot be "close" to a stranger unless you are talking about physical proximity to a person. The very word stranger denotes a person who is unknown to you thus making it impossible to be closer to that person than to family or friends who are known to you.
AA11232725	Slavery was abolished by New Testament Christians and this morality was imposed upon the rest of the pagan nations in this world. Other than the issue of slavery, what great moral advances have been seen in this CONSTANT evolution? Women's sufferage or equal rights for different races? Gee, that comes right out of the New Testament also.    Galatians 3:27  For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  (28)  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.    Colossians 3:11  Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.    If Jesus hadn't come and taught these moral principles to mankind it's doubtful that people would have implemented them on their own. The onlly reason it took so long was because the Bible wasn't available to most people for about 1700 years.    Christians don't fight things like equal pay for equal work. Neither do they promote discrimination based upon race. They do fight the idea that men and women are exactly the same. Common sense tells us that they are not. Sure there have been people who called themselves Christians who fought against these things but they were not using what the Bible teaches, they were using what their current societies morals and traditions taught. That's why Jesus called the hyper-religious people of his day hypocrites, because they made the word of God void with their man made traditions.    Matthew 15:3  He answered them, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?  (4)  For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.'  (5)  But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God,  (6)  he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God.  (7)  You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:  (8)  "'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;  (9)  in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'"|`|AA11932904	Slavery is a social system, I believe.

It does acknowledge it and instructs how slaves are to act and be treated.  Second:  Morality does not evolve, it changes.  A few years ago it was socially acceptable to smoke.  Today, it is not.  A few years ago virginity was in and homosexuality was out.  Now it's reversed.  I could go on...but why bother........

223e871289fb7214ef96986f81c3e186aa	ITS IS WRONG!!!!! why? first because it is not true that Christ birth in this time of the year. if you will read the bible it says there Luke 2:7 -8 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. it is clear there that Christ did not born on winter season. second what catholic called christmas is basically based on pagan worship(festivity)|`|473ccf4ea2cfb964f9c69e3f165455e3aa	Yes it's wrong. I worked on a X-mas tree farm and was amazed at the amount of chemical fertilizer and herbicides used. Not to mention that they take 5 years to get to a marketable size. Then they are trucked, sit in your living room for 2 weeks and tossed. Talk about being wasteful! Only affluent countries could even think of such a wasteful practice.    And thanks for asking.|`|d45a15ef47ccb3ed90fbff1fb9b09ef6aa	Well, being that I'm a pagan.. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I don't use it to celebrate Jesus' birthday.

It's their spiritual walk, and they don't answer to you, me or any other human being for it.|`|ce394cc3237a1b9e9ba8b97e22c195dfaa	It's Pagan in Origin. Everything that was made in commemoration of jesus is defiled and intended to cut out Paganism.|`|AA10933387	I don't think it is wrong at all to  celebrate the Nativity of Jesus with a Christmas tree - it is a right and appropriate symbol used for many years now.|`|AA11367301	The reason people put up trees and lights cannot be assumed by you.  I put them up becuase they are fun, and it feels nice to have them.  Real tress are on sale during this time of year and easily accessable.  It is also acceptable to put lights up during this time.  I do not do it to celebrate Jesus' Brithday, but I do it out of tradition and culture.  To "celebrate" Jesus' birthday, I go to church, pray, read the scriptures and fast.  Take that to the bank!|`|04eaa3b707fecc377d89a52d2fb4afa9aa	So much for knowing tradition and the reason behind the actions.  The tree is symbolic of Jesus death and celebrating his life.  The lights on the tree are symbolic of the angels rejoicing in the heavens that God came to earth and was living among men.  The candy cane as well is a symbol of the death and resurrection of Jesus.   All of these came about because it was not acceptable to believe and be a real Christian at the time.    Christmas is celebrating "the day", not the actual day, that God came to earth, lived and walked in the shoes of a man.  God experienced all of life as we do and yet showed us how to follow His guidance and wisdom about how to live life, relating to Him and to each other.  Christmas is the celebration of God coming to earth and walking His talk, living life based on what the bible says, in how we conduct our self and relate to each other and to God.    God has not just "told us" how to live life for the best, He came to earth and showed us that we can live a life that reflects, represents and honors God as well as being respectful and honorable to each other.  All it takes is for us to be willing for God to become a part of and a participant of our daily life.|`|f02c05c20a32eef69459d1df6e529db3aa	It's just a tradition-I've been doing it for forty years and I've never given it much thought but I don't see how it can be wrong.|`|e16a8c7e1eb3c7768d0c63de7a721e75aa	I disagree.  It's part of the old Celtic celebrations, of tree decorating.  The actual symbolism is nothing to do with Xianity or Jebus.        And I do think cutting down a healthy tree is wrong and wasteful.  Mine is a fake tree.|`|239f1998b43b186cee5ec6b53aeb1e7caa	its a pagan symbol for renewed life.

Plus every year they put Jesus back in the manger and he isnt born every year. Jesus is in heaven with God. As far as putting up a tree I have no problem with it. I dont care what many try to say about it being pagan. Well it isnt. I dont bow down to my tree and worship it, or gloryify it in anyway. I am sure many who are saved will say the same on that.|`|ee18aeea2b6f15783753733a5680e881aa	I think if peoples want to have fun by decorating chirstman tree and lights so ther is nothing wrong in it.I m muslim and we don't celeberate birthdays of prophets in that way.but i feel that christains feel good and enjoy this thing so its  not a big deal. human life is very precious and one should collect as much joyful events as one can , as it is short as well !!!     peace !!!|`|24a44f1787f4398b7d8a1a4e415da768aa	It's not wrong at all, I just don't mention it around jewish people.|`|173032c7db6d958bd58340628e1ba337aa	I don't think it's necessarily wrong. I don't personally like Christmas trees. I am fully aware of their origin. However, if someone wants to decorate their house with one (like my wife does) then I think it's OK. As long it's just a decoration and nothing else to you (like something to worship, or a representation of god) I can't see what harm it does.     Basically as long as the tree does not come between you and your relationship with God it's not harmful spiritually.
af5e6a0d374e7a0c8e8d11a24b026fccaa	We use bits of bread at our church. You could request low-fat Communion wafers. The brand is "I Can't Believe It's Not Jesus".

9c8d5d3380bd983975d1c9e28a2b1190aa	Hola Kanec,    Te respondo primero la segunda pregunta, que me parece muy bien que la planees.     No se que es exactamente lo que motiva a muchos a preguntar sobre temas imposibles de responder como Existe o no existe Dios. Como tu bien lo dices, son preguntas que llevan siglos en discucin.     Ahora bien, si la intencin de quien pregunta es iniciar un debate o recoger puntos de vista diferentes para enriquecer el suyo, me parece ms que valido que planeen dichas preguntas, en el entendido que solo seran aproximaciones a la pregunta y jamas respuestas concluyentes.     Por el contrario, si pretenden zanjar semejante duda, claramente este no es lugar adecuado, (ante semejante pregunta no se cual lo sea).     Bueno, he ah mi opinin.

Nuestra vida es corta y por ello no sabemos con certeza lo que paso en pocas pasadas menos an si son muy antiguas. He leido la Iliada y la Odisea y son relatos muy vividos, no me parece que sean pura fantasa, por ejemplo: observese cuando se dice "Vena apolo en su carro de fuego", eso es alusivo a una tecnologa extraterrestre, ya sea que sean dragones que vomitan fuego o caballos, etc.   En la rebelin de Lucifer de J.J. Benitez. Editorial Planeta, se dice algo sobre la estancia de los extraterrestres en el planeta y que se les retiro porque infringieron las normas que de entrada les haban dado, estaban aqu para ense?ar a los Terrcolas de esa poca, pero tenan prohibido cohabitar con ellos, y cuando vinieron a supervisarlos se dieron cuenta que haban infringido,  como amonestacin les retiraron el rbol cuyos frutos les daban la inmortalidad, por lo cual se hicieron mortales.   Los frutos del rbol, podran muy bien ser un regulador de glandular y hormonal y con ello, si no viven miles de a?os cuando menos alcanzan trescientos a?os terrestres.   Hawnser en su libro "La respuesta", dice que el planeta ha recibido visitas todo el tiempo, tambien habla de seres que vibran en diferentes dimensiones, ejemplo de ello El Rab de Galilea, que vibra en la trigsima tercer dimensin, y que posee varios cuerpos y un nivel muy alto de energa que inclusive no necesita vehculos espaciales para transportarse, peero que an as el no ha visto al Padre porque el nivel energtico del Padre es superior "se supone que vive en una isla nuclear", y que obviamente no puede ser pisada por pies terrcolas, porque los habitantes de planeta tierra bvibran en la tercera dimensin. Tambin narra que los extraterrestres para sus viajes intergalacticos tienen conductos y naves acordes a ello, y para viajjes mas cortos se desplazan de manera diferente, por ello tienen naves nodrizas y vehculos ms ligeros. En este libro incluso pone diagramas, y detalla el vehculo que usaron en la misin en la Ciudad de Mxico.  Por si te interesa verlo seres semejantes a ti que cruzan dimensiones y que puedes verlos fsicamente en Mrida hay unos que se llaman Chaneques, visita Mrida y dile a un lugare?o que te indique como hacer para que los veas, ellos no tienen la tecnologa de la raza de las pleyades que nos aventaja doscientos a?os de civilizacin.|`|168e6155ab83426860264e2ce51f490daa	Solo se busca provocar , sentir una reaccin, hacer que la otra persona se sienta incomoda .

If you really truly have those feelings, get help.  You are young, and haven't even realized the experience associated with love of a spouse, the gift of creating a family, etc. Remember: when you're gay, you get the circle of life and trash it.  It is not natural and all you have to do to document that is to look at your body parts, then at the parts of the opposite sex - see how they fit together? Nature  is perfect, but man seems to think he mess with anything at all, even nature, to suit his own inability to keep his/her pants up.  As far as flirting online goes, flirting is fun anywhere, even on the net.  Whatever you do, remember that whoever you are talking to on the net could say they are a 16 yr old girl, when in reality you are talking to a 50 year old male nut case.

4f07f2a717240f59a97ac2c85778c9baaa	I thank you, for you are the only one that agrees with what women went through before our times. It was different then what is now. as to your question.    Aishah was the daughter of one of the closest companions of Prophet Muhammad, Abu Bakr.  An old friend of the Prophet, Abu Bakr was one of the earliest converts to the faith and was considered to be the most sincere, earnest, and devoted in faith.  Seeing the loss of the Prophet, one of the woman companions proposed Abu Bakrs daughter to him and approached Abu Bakr on behalf of the Prophet.  But there were two problems.  One, Aishah was already betrothed to Jubair bin Mutim, a pagan Meccan.  Jubair, it turned out, had lost interest because of the wide gulf between paganism and Islam.  In addition, Aishah had not yet reached puberty, and this also contributed to Jubairs disinterest in pursuing the betrothal.  Thus, she was betrothed to the Prophet while still in Mecca, and three years later, when both were in Medina and she had reached puberty, he consummated his marriage.  She was the only virgin he married, though they did not have any children.  Aishah was a leading scholar of Islam and played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Islamic civilization.  She taught for forty years after the death of the Prophet until her death at the age of sixty-seven.|`|51892c12506b240500310aefa8daf61daa	Yes it is true. The people who hated the prophet when he was alive called him all sorts of things. Magician, poet, liar, madman etc. They never once called him a pedophile. Why? because it was a common tradition. They didnt even say anything about the marriage. She grew up to be one of the most important scholars of Islam. Not to forget his other wives who were either widows or divorced. Aishah was the only virgin. His first wife was 40 and he was 25 when they married. I dont know how some Muslims ca disregard the authentic hadiths. Yes there are some weak hadiths but sahih al bukhari and sahih al muslim is authentic. (hence the name sahih). Research on hadiths. The hadiths have a big status in Islam.  http://www.al-ibaanah.com/ebooks.php?EID...|`|c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	The hadith collections of Bukhari (d. 870) and Muslim b. al-Hajjaj (d. 875) are in general regarded as the most authentic by Sunni Muslims. Both quote Aisha herself claiming she was six or seven at the time of her marriage and nine when the marriage was consummated.    *Ayesaha was a baby being carried by an angel when the Prophet dreamed of her:    Sahih Bukhari 9.140  Narrated 'Aisha: Allah's Apostle said to me, "You were shown to me twice (in my dream) before I married you. I saw an angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said to him, 'Uncover (her),' and behold, it was you. I said (to myself), 'If this is from Allah, then it must happen.    Sahih al-Bukhari 810-870 A.D. 256 A.H.  Narrated Hishams father: Khadija died three years before the Prophet departed to Medina. He stayed there for two years or so and then he married Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consummated that marriage when she was nine years old." Bukhari vol.5 book 58 no.236 p.153.     Sahih Muslim 817-875 A.D. 261 A.H.  "(3310) Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old."    (3311) Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him) married here when she was seven years old, and she was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and here dolls were with her: and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old." Sahih Muslim vol.2 book 8 ch.548 no.3310,3311 p.716.    Sunan Abu Dawud 817-888/9 A.D. 275 A.H.  Aishah said : The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) married me when I was seven years old. The narrator Sulaiman said : Or six years. He had intercourse with me when I was nine years old." Abu Dawud vol.2 no.2116 p.569    *In another part Ayesha claims that as long as she remembers her parents were always Muslims.     Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 58, Number 245   Narrated 'Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam)    *If Ayesha was older i.e. 16 or 18 as some Muslims claim, she would have remembered the religion of her parents prior to becoming Muslims.|`|22f5c47916595b5bc31dfcbbb7ef131baa	My Christian family said that it is true, what more proof could you want?|`|AA11036328	Yes, it is true.

Thousands of years ago the Pharaohs kings and queens married at age younger than 10 both males and females..King Tut on his death was only 16!   and they were able to enjoy their sex life and have healthy children,  Women in that era at this age were mature enough to be responsible for a family and people in this era had shorter life spans than now  why didn't we call them pedophiles?    The last Chinese emperor in the last century married at the age of 12 a   girl of 17 ! and we didn't call her a pedophile    The fanatics ignore all those events in the history , and try to focus only on our prophet's private life!  they have more wonderful things about islam to focus on rather than his life!

His lust for sex, his affairs with his maids and slave girls, his pedophilic relationship with Aisha a 9-year-old child at the age of 53, his killing sprees, his massacre and the genocide of the Jews, his slave making and trading, his assassination of his opponents, his raids and lootings of the merchant caravans, his burning of the palm plantations, his destroying the water wells, his cursing and invoking evil on his enemies and his revenge on his captured prisoners of war disqualify him as a decent human being let alone the messenger of God   An unbiased study of Quran shows that far from being a miracle that book is a hoax. Once Quran is scrutinized with rational thinking, almost every sentence proves to be false. Quran is replete with scientific heresies, historic blunders, mathematical mistakes, logical absurdities and grammatical errors. Could possibly the author of this Universe be as ignorant as it appears to be in Quran?   Quran tells Muslims to kill the disbelievers wherever they find them (Q. 2:191), to murder them and treat them harshly (Q. 9:123), slay them (Q. 9:5), fight with them, (Q. 8: 65 ) even if they are Christians and Jews, humiliate them and impose on them a penalty tax (Q. 9: 29). Quran takes away the freedom of belief from all humanity and tell clearly that no other religion except Islam is accepted (Q. 3: 85). It relegates those who disbelieve in Quran to hell (Q. 5:10), calls them najis (filthy, untouchable, impure) (Q. 9: 28). It orders its followers to fight the unbelievers until no other religion except Islam is left (Q. 2: 193). It says that the non-believers will go to hell and will drink boiling water (Q. 14: 17).     It asks the Muslims to slay or crucify or cut the hands and feet of the unbelievers, that they be expelled from the land with disgrace and that they shall have a great punishment in world hereafter (Q.5: 34). As for the disbelievers, it says that for them garments of fire shall be cut and there shall be poured over their heads boiling water whereby whatever is in their bowls and skin shall be dissolved and they will be punished with hooked iron rods (Q. 22: 9). Quran prohibits a Muslim to befriend a non-believer even if that non-believer is the father or the brother of that Muslim (Q. 9: 23), (Q. 3: 28). Quran asks the Muslims to strive against the unbelievers with great endeavor (Q. 25: 52), be stern with them because they belong to hell (Q. 66: 9). The holy Prophet demanded his follower to strike off the heads of the disbelievers; then after making a wide slaughter among them, carefully tie up the remaining captives (Q. 47: 4). As for women the book of Allah says that they are inferior to men and their husbands have the right to scourge them if they are found disobedient (Q. 4:34). It teaches that women will go to hell if they are disobedient to their husbands (Q. 66:10). It maintains that men have an advantage over the women (Q. 2:228). It not only denies the women's equal right to their inheritance (Q. 4:11-12), it also regards them as imbeciles and decrees that their witness is not admissible in the court (Q. 2:282).     This means that a woman who is raped cannot accuse her rapist unless she can produce a male witness. Muhammad allowed the Muslims to marry up to four wives and gave them license to sleep with their slave maids and as many captive women as they may have (Q. 4:3). He himself did just that. This is why anytime a Muslim army subdues another nation, they call them kafir and allow themselves to rape their women. Pakistani soldiers raped up to 250,000 Bangali women in 1971 after they massacred 3,000,000 unarmed civilians when their religious leader decreed that Bangladeshis are unislamic. This is why the prison guards in Islamic regime of Iran rape the women and then kill them after calling them apostates and the enemies of Allah.|`|AA10698133	it is true but you said it yourself that even in other religions they did it too. we have to consider that back then girls were maturing a lot younger then now for example: back then a girl would hit puberty ( menstrual) aroung the age of 8 but now it's more like 12 so thimes have evolved|`|90b495b823a6ca13be66f8e59698830baa	according to the hadith but not the qur'an the hadith is considered false. but from history that far back it is impossible to know.|`|80f190719e3481440070cfae5c3c698caa	Who the **** you think you are try to thread people.   34:5 Those who challenge the revelation of muhammad will have a painful doom. this is what islam is about, thread.

However I liked the idea of the person "smile " writing !!     Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) went sent for a mission like any other prophet before him(PBUH). Hence, whatever he was meant to be an example of how Muslim should lead a good pious life without hurting or violating anybody or anybody's rights!!   nothing he did was out of vain or lust or any sinful act !! Every thing had a meaning purpose and hence everybody should try to be open-minded think carefully what they are saying about him (PBUH) and cause who knows in the end , they pay a big price for what are saying ? Afterall , he is a Prophet sent to mankind for   correction for deeds from God.    anyway , God knows the best !!     Thank you for asking this question|`|AA10394340	I would like to keep something in mind , the early history of islam needed a bright brain and someone young to record every movement of the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) , and that was Aisha ,   she was young enough to have a sharp memory .  so let's look at it as a need for islam and some kind of reserver for the islamic history|`|dd7229773441aaf6412f5d8bb57b459faa	its sort of a disputed fact. she was young, in any case. plenty of people marry that young, its actually modern western society that marries so late (and now of course the rest of the world does too)  because most girls reach puberty at around that age, and i think its wise to marry when you reach puberty, well, only if you are prepared to. but you should be prepared before marriage at any age.. lol.
56327a20d04f3622132ab5c1e42c9adaaa	Since the Sovliet Union we down, there hasn't been a nation as yet to be identified.  Gods angel continued with the prophecy, saying: He [the king of the north] will arouse his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great military force; and the king of the south, for his part, will excite himself for the war with an exceedingly great and mighty military force. And he [the king of the north] will not stand, because they will scheme out against him schemes. And the very ones eating his delicacies will bring his breakdown. And as for his military force, it will be flooded away, and many will certainly fall down slain.Daniel 11:25, 26.    12 So who is the king of the north now? Is he to be identified with one of the countries that were part of the old Soviet Union? Or is he changing identity completely, as he has a number of times before? We cannot say. Who will be the king of the north when Daniel 11:44,?45 is fulfilled? Will the rivalry between the two kings flare up again? And what of the huge nuclear stockpiles that still exist in a number of lands? Only time will provide the answers to these questions.    13 One thing we do know. Soon, the king of the north will conduct an offensive campaign that will be triggered by reports that will disturb him, out of the sunrising and out of the north. This campaign will immediately precede his end. We can learn more about these reports if we consider other Bible prophecies.    14 First, though, notice that these acts of the king of the north are not said to be against the king of the south. He does not come to his end at the hands of his great rival. Similarly, the king of the south is not destroyed by the king of the north. The southern king (represented in other prophecies as the final horn to appear on a wild beast) is destroyed without [human] hand by Gods Kingdom. (Daniel 7:26; 8:25) In fact, all earthly kings are finally destroyed by Gods Kingdom at the battle of Armageddon, and this evidently is what happens to the king of the north. (Daniel 2:44; 12:1; Revelation 16:14,?16) Daniel 11:44,?45 describes events leading up to that final battle. No wonder there will be no helper when the king of the north meets his end!|`|AA11708208	I dont think they award kingships of entire compass points. Half the globe is 'the north'.

Mary was a virgin when she conceived and gave birth to Jesus. Mary had other children after Jesus. His brothers James and Jude wrote books of the Bible.    It is only the Catholic church that teaches that Mary remained a virgin all of her life.  Christian Bible teaching churches refer to her as "Mary, Mother of Jesus."  Mat 12:46 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.  The idea that Mary was a sinless virgin was one of the traditions that Pope Pius invented in 1854.  This tradition along with many other Catholic traditions is man made and not Biblical.|`|e7881c8de7d3a94175f10d95a6ec7cb5aa	She wasn't married to Joseph when Jesus was born.    Matthew 1: 18 -  This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.     Matthew 1: 24 -  When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.  But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.    Although Mary and Joseph did consummate their marriage, they waited until after Jesus was born.  She is only referred to as a "virgin" in context with Jesus' birth.|`|205613df744dfda3f9109432f764b542aa	Because apparently the ONLY thing of any value she ever did for the world (according to religion) was incubating Jesus.

She is called "virgin" because that's the term which was used for ANY UNMARRIED WOMAN. And when Mary and Joseph came to Bethlehem, they weren't married already.

Revelation 22:16  i.e, I am Lucifer In his own words, though most did not know that the Morning Star is the planet Venus that stands for Lucifer a Latin word meaning "light-bearer" (from lux, "light", and ferre, "to bear, bring")    Jesus said, "Perhaps people think that I have come to cast peace upon the world. They do not know that I have come to cast conflicts upon the earth: fire, sword, war.

First of all if you didnt have knowledge you wouldnt know how to make money and once you made the money you would have to have the knowledge to know to invest it, to save it, or how to spend it wisely! Knowledge can lead you down the path to self happiness versus money leading you down a path of quick self fulfillment. I guess its all in the eyes of the beholder really. I think that knowledge is really powerful and helpful in the long run and that money is really powerful and helpful for the short term if you dont have knowledge! To me, being 23, knowledge is way more important... i love being smart and having the knowledge to persue anything i want to versus having all the money and being naive.

09fb14d66d014c3ec713bb71c64b144daa	Here is an opinion. However if you do believe that you should tithe then, (also an opinion) you might consider giving based on your gross income. After all God gave his all to us. Should we not be compelled to do the same?    Is tithing for the New Testament Church?  Answer: emphatically NO!         The bible says tithing is a law, so that means it is a LAW! One place the bible tells us that tithing is a law is in (Hebrews 7:5 KJV). There are many other places in the Old Testament that tells us that to tithe is an Old Testament law. In the New Testament, however, we are plainly told that we now live by grace because of Jesus. ~~ (Galatians 2:16 KJV) Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. ~~ This verse alone tells us that we are not under the law as born again Christians. If we believe Jesus paid the price for our sins and we are made a new person by the blood of Jesus, then we are no longer under the law. So we live by grace. Grace livers give because they love God and want to give as He directs them.     This is one of the verses that make me feel so strongly about this issue: (Rom 4:13-16 KJV) For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,|`|AA10551026	No it is not in the new.. it is said that we're supposed to give from our heart and that the Lord likes a cheerful giver.... and  sometimes you'll give more than others. He says listen to your heart when giving. You can also offer your time and talent for your faith instead of always it being your treasure.|`|e57c7db914fb45d19d9afc6f475d8c37aa	Some will say yes and some no, but the thing is that if God is going to bless your finances then you really must tithe as a basic amount of giving and then if God tells you to give an offering of more then you give it.  God needs to be in control of your finances.    (Obviously you need to have a personal relationship with Christ or you will never know what he wants you to do)    I see that someone put gross pay..the tithe as I understand is on your gain, if your salary is from a company then I always tithed on the gross.  If you own a business personally you tithe on the salary that you take out of the business and not the gross of the whole company before expenses.   If you buy and sell things you tithe on your gain after expenses.    This is the way I have done it and it has always worked for me and I have been blessed.  I am not wealthy, but I always have what I need and God takes care of me.    God at times has spoken to my heart to give beyond titheing and I have obeyed him and I never came to need, although I sometimes was thinking that I would..    My experience is give and it will be given to you.    I do not normally give handouts of cash to everyone that asks, but will buy a meal for almost anyone when it comes to food..|`|1e2aa41e34c037a92a687f6f7fcfcd71aa	Yes.  Gross pay.|`|ecc566b2b7a4878c96826d3e51111de5aa	Yes. Gross pay.  You pay God before paying Caesar.|`|aa31c3b9e60704382f19c38af231f597aa	Here in austria, the bishop has made a contract with the Vatican that he will donate a certain amount of money every year (872,000euros). All catholics are required to pay 'kirchenbeitrag." I forgot how it was calculated but it is derived from the salary and all income of parents and children.    JWs don't have tithes.  Because when Jesus came: Ephesians2: 15?By means of his flesh he abolished the enmity, the Law of commandments consisting in decrees, that he might create the two peoples in union with himself into one new man and make peace...    We are not under Mosaic Law anymore. also:    2 Corinthians 9:7?Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	Most religions will tell you yes.  But that is because they have lots of financial obligations.  The true religion does not pay their ministers or leaders and according to the new testament, what you receive free, give free.  There is no law requiring donating a certain amount of money.  It is up to the person what they can give.  Make it a matter of prayer and give accordingly.  God does not expect people of little means to donate.  If the religion has Gods backing, it will survive without asking for donations. Jesus and the apostles were not paid for their ministry work.  They were housed and fed sometimes by members, but they had regular jobs.  Of course, donations were accepted but not demanded. True religion shares what they have so there is an equalizing among members. 2Co 8:14.|`|AA12090614	Deuteronomy 12:5-8--   5 But YOU ARE TO SEEK THE HABITATION OF YOUR FATHER; THE HOUSE OF YAHWEH--the place which Yahweh your Father shall choose out of all your tribes to establish His Name--and THERE YOU MUST GO.   6 THERE you must bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your TITHES, and special gifts you have vowed to give, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.       Mat 5:18  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.        Mat 5:19  Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.        Mat 5:20  For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.     You pay on your gross income to your Heavenly Father's House. Anything else you are paying your money in vain.|`|AA12139805	no|`|1251439840536e74f6d7b721cab71471aa	Yes, we are commanded to do it (10%) and it's on the gross pay. We do it out of obedience and love.    Let me ask you this...    When you step through the gates of Heaven and Jesus is standing there, arms open, big grin on His face...and He says, to you..."there's something I want to know, you haven't been paying your tithe...why were you stealing from me?" What will be your answer.    We tithe because all that we own belongs to Him. We are to be good stewards of everything He has blessed us with.    TRUE STORY: The last couple of paychecks...I sure could have used my tithe to buy Christmas gifts. I prayed about it and gave my tithe. I knew my bills were covered but in my heart, I wanted to be able to give gifts for Christmas. (It is better to give than receive.)    I knew God could do more with my 10% than I could and I also had faith He would provide.    Part of my prayer was that my company would give out bonuses this year, so that, that would be my Christmas money. (They have previously...I was hoping and praying it would happen this year as well.)    I got my Christmas bonus. It was for three times the amount that it was for last year. Even after taxes, it's twice as much as it was last year (before taxes.) I'm able to buy gifts and pay a large bill that was looming.    I promise, if you will walk in faith and obey Him...He will provide|`|831048245fb075b5ad4ab55ab7e3fac2aa	Its unfortunate that many people do not understand what is meant by Christ fulfilling the law. The law of god and what he said was right and wrong is still the same as it always was. Christ fulfilled the law in that he paid the wage of death for sin and the sacrfices of animals and the actions that needed to be taken to cover sin were undone. The fulfillment of the law by Christ does not mean that God changed his mind and you get to ignore the OT. Tithing  is still a command of God|`|5dd4b41928cec9bf30a9bfea41245763aa	No, tithe is not required. It is a sign of worship and if it was mandatory that would be a "work" and works do not save. Just as singing in church is not required, but it is still encouraged and appreciated. James speaks of how 'Faith without works is dead.' This does not mean works are required, it just means faith INSPIRES works if it is true faith. So many faithful Christians do give the illustrated amount of tithe out of faith that they can live on less than 100 cents on the dollar, but it is not required.

(Yes, the guy who married former playboy models who needed to get boob jobs to please him and he still dumped them.)    Role models? Sorry, I think that's bunk.    Beauty pagents are about ideal beauty. They try to make it about more but in reality, the swimsuit is what people come to see.    Want a role model. Try mother terressa, or what not. Or ever doctors, nurses, lawyers, etc. Why women should feel role model is being "owned" by a corporation for a year?    (Or put it this way. Your female with good character but don't look best in a bathing suit, your out. You look good in a bathing suit and can fake good character, ...)    Add on: Sure beauty contestants CAN have good character but that is not really what they are chosen for so much. They do have to make the corporation they work for, (people of shallow character like mister trump), look good. Charities are good. It is not a sin to be a beauty queen or anything, but all the rules? Highly hypocritical.|`|d9bc59b60b5f66b2405e4be235c113b0aa	.Image...and their stuck up/conceited.

Believed to have majority of it written between 621-597 BC but not finished until 561BC after Jehoiachin was released from prison in Babylon.    It is hard to be precise as these two books (three really since Kings is divided into 2) are made up of several seperate writings covering long periods.

Biblical scholars have worked hard to obtain the texts in the original languages to avoid the problems related to multiple retranslations.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	The main thing to think about is after each translation what of the original translation was left -- that's the one you want to follow . The Catholic Bible is the most original of the time of Jesus. The use of the Septuagint was the most accepted -- even by Jesus.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	The original languages were Hebrew / Chaldean for the Old Testament, and Greek for the New Testament. Both were eventually translated into Latin (The Latin Vulgate).  Latin forms the basis for all the romance languages, of which English is one.   But the best translations are direct from the Hebrew and Greek into English. The King James version is the most accurate of the English translations. It was translated in 1611.|`|AA11610394	Hebrew and Greek....king James is EXCellent..  not sure how many KJ might have been first|`|379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	the torah and old testament were originally written in hebrew and I think a smattering of Aramaic.    the torah scrolls themselves are still in hebrew, and generally have little to no alteration. though some dispute this.    the old testament is still used in hebrew by jewish people,  or rather its a recent direct translation of it from hebrew to english, rather than a layered translation.    hebrew to english is questionable, but the other notable translation historically would be the Septugiant, which by the story anyway, was translated for the Library of Alexandria, from Hebrew into Greek, and is considered by many to be the only 100% accurate non-hebrew version of the old testament, due to the method wich it was translated.|`|AA11973951	The original languages of the Bible are Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic..

I hope this is accurate.|`|2f9652c2bf4c307890d9d8223d481590aa	Well, it might have been written in hebrew, but Jesus spoke aramaic, and that's the language i believe it was written in.  And thru how many translations did it went trough? No one can say. But translations are in general pretty accurate (but not without fault), What you should ask yourself is how many people changed the bible because it didn't suit their needs.|`|AA11910766	The Old Testament was written in Ancient Hebrew, the New Testament was written in Greek and the book of Daniel was written in Aramaic.  The Bible is the most translated book in human history, so far it's been translated in thousands of languages.  The original King James version was translated in English from the original Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic texts that they had available at the time.  Since that time we've recovered thousands of more ancient copies and manuscripts, like the Dead Sea Scrolls found in 1948, so the New King James version takes those new finds into account.  Several translations out today are what is called a "meaning for meaning" translation, while the King James and New King James are "word for word" translations.  You can also buy key word study bibles and parallel bibles that will show you the ancient original text and compare it to the English versions.    There are some translations, like the "Today's New International Version or TNIV (not to be confused with the NIV) that purposely add text, change text, and take away text from the original translations.  I'd advise you steer clear of these translations.    But in general, any word for word or meaning for meaning translation will you give you an accurate picture of what was actually said.|`|2616fab19d0dc79ed6fab6e554cc31e5aa	The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, except for Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, which were written in Aramaic, the language the Hebrews acquired during the Babylonian captivity.    The New Testament was written in Koine Greek, except for Matthew which was first written in Aramaic, and later translated to Greek.    The O.T. was translated into Greek about 250 B.C.  It is called the Septuegent.  A complete discussion of Bible translations is far too extensive for this forum.|`|AA10239241	The OT was written in Hebrew (primarily), Greek and in some instances -- Aramaic -- the language of Jesus.  The only acceptable one to most Jews of today is the Hebrew because there are no other "translations" to use the word in its exact context.  All else is simply interptretation -- subject to change according to whomever is carrying out the process.  At least, I'm pretty sure that that is what I read!
AA10242125	I think Cuban based on my reading.|`|AA12383685	Yummy I love me some Cuban and Puerto Rican people they are so hot.|`|AA12364724	more Cubans|`|f1dd538d62ec18493ff43366c92ccfc3aa	Definitely Puerto Ricans, if you count the ones in Puerto Rico since  it is part of the USA (not a state)..All born under the American flag  and are American Citizens.|`|205f6fda159cfd093d948c766a50368baa	If you exclude Puerto Rico, then there are more Cubans in the USA.|`|4cb79d5c81faf052c1c57b347e5c2f5aaa	There are more Puerto Ricans than Cubans.  This is because Puerto Ricans are part of the United States, They are citizens and not immagrants like Cubans are.  Cubans need a passport and a visa.|`|fd9a721795c0273f9d0be7e35bf20c01aa	Since Puerto Rico is a US territory - pretty much all Puerto Ricans are in the US already (only the ones in other foreign countries are not in the US). So clearly more Puerto Ricans than Cubans.    Puerto Ricans are automatically statutory US citizens, pay US payroll taxes (social security and medicare) etc.    According to Wiki:  4 Million Puerto Ricans in the continental US  1.5  Million Cuban Americans (native and foreign born).    Note that the 4 Million continental Puerto Ricans outnumbers the 3 Million additional people actually living in Puerto Rico    So if you exclude Puerto Rico itself there are roughly three times as many Puerto Ricans as Cubans. If you include Puerto Rico then there are roughly five times as many Puerto Ricans.

I believe that we are given a reward in the astral realm after our physical life is over. It's duration and fullness depends on the karma we have accumulated while in physical form on earth.

"Know thou of a truth that the soul, after its separation from the body, will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of God, in a state and condition which neither the revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes and chances of this world, can alter.  It will endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His dominion and power will endure.  It will manifest the signs of God and His attributes, and will reveal His loving kindness and bounty."    2. "As to the question whether the souls will recognize each other in the spiritual world: this fact is certain; for the Kingdom is the world of vision where all the concealed realities will become disclosed.  How much more the well-known souls will become manifest.  The mysteries of which man is heedless in this earthly world, those he will discover in the heavenly world, and there will he be informed of the secret of truth; how much more will he recognize or discover persons with whom he hath been associated.  Undoubtedly, the holy souls who find a pure eye and are favored with insight will, in the kingdom of lights, be acquainted with all mysteries, and will seek the bounty of witnessing the reality of every great soul.  Even they will manifestly behold the Beauty of God in that world."    3.  "... a love that one may have entertained for any one will not be forgotten in the world of the Kingdom.  Likewise, thou wilt not forget (there) the life that thou hast had in the material world."|`|4fbe20b8dc73d15f443ce1d31e20ca1daa	As a Theravada Buddhist our Teaching says precisely that. A Life is reborn immediately following death depending on the Life's level of evolution and the Karmic consequence of previous Life experience and Action.    I am very moved by your insight and analogy, its refreshing to hear a non Buddhists views on a difficult and often misrepresented and misunderstood concept, especially when given the simplest and most honest interpretation.    In your words I will think about it... most assuredly    Thank you. A moving story.    Peace from a Buddhist in the season of joy....|`|ba3d5285333584f26906188515021fb4aa	Interesting, but untrue.|`|e984bbe2e95660f5ad80ed9daba4a372aa	The Jury is out.  However I personally lean away from the notion that the dark tunnel and white light may correlate with immediate reincarnation.  I think that it probably does do so in some instances, but that if it does, then it does not do so very often.    People who do not understand that time is an illusion will tell you that you can't go immediately from death to birth because it took the fetus nine months to mature.      There might be the counter-argument that the soul only enters the body at birth, but most people who believe in souls do not believe that.  It is more common to believe that our souls enter our bodies at the moment of conception.    And of course there are a range of opinions in between these two extremes including some opinions that require the child to reach a particular age such as five or seven years old or such before it may be considered to be a human being.    However, time and space are illusions, so it is not only possible for someone who is dying to begin another life in a new womb before their death, but it is also possible for a soul to incarnate multiple times in the same world at roughly the same time.    People will make up all sorts of arguments why this just can't be true, but the bottom line is no one really knows.  To the best of my understanding and expereince creation is absolutely infinite and anything we may imagine is true in some universe or other, in one parallel dimension or another...    As for purgatory, we create that for ourselves when we believe we've done something marginally bad and don't know how to atone for it... but whether we create an afterlife experience of heaven or hell or purgatory, we can always move on from those experiences and find something else to experience, whether it will be a blissful time with our soul mates in the spirit world, or a new reincarnation, or a resurrection in which we return to a life we have previously died in.    Those are our three options between lives.  If there are other options I am unaware of them.  I have been trained to assist recently deceased spirits who are having difficulty resuming their lives on their own to choose one of these options and move on.
b330712fc4019962f2b2be9e695a3c4eaa	I have never gotten so many answers that a second page was required to display them all, and that really bothers me.    I want to think that my questions arouse a great deal of response and are of great import, and I'm disappointed that so far that is not the case.    What bothers me even more is the church people often delete my questions and send me Violation Notices, cause they disagree with my questions.  Sometimes I hang my head and cry.  Sort  of.    Why can't they just disagree with answers, why do they have to disagree with questions?      I never use bad or offensive language.  I always ask the questions politely, yet they are often able to delete them.      Along with each Violation Notice is the reason:  against community guidelines.    IN WHAT WAY?

If I had this knowledge, I could not own it; it would belong to the world.  Nor would I want to play God and hold back a miraculous cure for only some of the population and not for others.

Even the later would justify the use.    Overcrowding is IMHO not the problem since You could maintain the brainy and experienced part of the population better, expand out of earth's orbit when needed and apply birth control if You must. Maintained health with a mere pill comes AFAIK much cheaper than raising and educating new ppl. Besides that, when You can keep the highly productives healthy  -  then You can easily sustain a lot more new off spring on Earth.    Such a pill can potentially improve the ratio between productives and young. This makes society generally more productive, This would improve the quality of raising ( better material base ) ...    Actually: our modern society is based on such an effect in the past. It was not the all curring pill - but only slightly less mortality ... in the western countries.     This is a major reason why we are rich now - while 3 world is poor. The big African problem nowadays with AIDS - this does the opposite of the all curing pill.

06c3bb8f6de6de5b84daed37a7c434feaa	I'm still trying to understand whether the predictions of Nostradamus are true or not. Most of us tend to dismiss his predictions as meaningless, jumbled verses that nobody can comprehend. I could imagine the frustrations in the faces of so many people who tried to interpret his verses through the centuries. Even myself felt a lot of skepticism on his predictions.    But then, I found something fascinating that's worth giving some thought:    In Nostradamus' period (the 15th century France), America haven't been discovered yet. The whole Middle-East is nothing but a vast desert inhabited by primitive, nomadic, camel-riding tribes dwelling on tents and mud-houses, who herd goats and sheeps to survive.    How did Nostradamus knew that the Middle-East would play such a huge role in the future times?. Why is it that so many of his predictions refer to conflicts and tumultous events in this region, and that those events shall have profound effect on people's lives on the whole planet?.    Is it mere coincidence or just a wild guess by Nostradamus?.|`|e149d8651ec2a8062fd5aee0bdd23a16aa	At least till the next one comes along...and he will.|`|df2da08c56595fad19dec6529fc73bc0aa	No, Saddam is nothing compared to the other Anti-Christs like Napoleon and Hitler.

ed23fc8fd4d685b8e8e460ae194f07e5aa	I don't think I could explain it myself clearly enough, so I copied and pasted a definition from Wikipedia.    A syllogism (Greek: ??  "conclusion", "inference"), usually the categorical syllogism, is a kind of logical argument in which one proposition (the conclusion) is inferred from two others (the premises) of a certain form. In his Prior Analytics, Aristotle defines syllogism as: "a discourse in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so." (24b1820) Despite this very general definition, however, he limits himself first to categorical syllogisms (and later to modal syllogisms). The syllogism is at the core of Deductive reasoning, where facts are determined by combining existing statements, in contrast to Inductive reasoning where facts are determined by experimenting on the world.|`|7211513118a3b8efe064939e53104446aa	I would agree with the wikipedia's definition.

94aa7b5af1e3c386f126e6a3bc1c8a4aaa	Well they were a tribe who were the sabbath breakers, here is your explanation    The Jews breach the Sanctity of the Sabbath    God said,    [???????? ??????????]    (And indeed you knew). This Ayah means, O Jews! Remember that God sent His torment on the village that disobeyed Him and broke their pledge and their covenant to observe the sanctity of the Sabbath. They began using deceitful means to avoid honoring the Sabbath by placing nets, ropes and artificial pools of water for the purpose of fishing before the Sabbath. When the fish came in abundance on Saturday as usual, they were caught in the ropes and nets for the rest of Saturday. During the night, the Jews collected the fish after the Sabbath ended. When they did that, God changed them from humans into monkeys, the animals having the form closest to humans. Their evil deeds and deceit appeared lawful on the surface, but they were in reality wicked. This is why their punishment was compatible with their crime. This story is explained in detail in Surat Al-A`raf, where God said (7:163),    [???????????? ???? ??????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ???? ????????? ??? ????????? ???? ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ??? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ]    (And ask them (O Muhammad ) about the town that was by the sea; when they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for they used to rebel (disobey God).)(7:163)    In his Tafsir, Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,    [????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ??????????]    (We said to them: "Be you monkeys, despised and rejected'') means, "God changed their bodies into those of monkeys and swines. The young people turned into monkeys while the old people turned into swine.'' Shayban An-Nahwi reported that Qatadah commented on,    [????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ??????????]    (We said to them: "Be you monkeys, despised and rejected''), "These people were turned into howling monkeys with tails, after being men and women.''    The Monkeys and Swine that exist now are not the Descendants of Those that were transformed    Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "Those who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath were turned into monkeys, then they perished without offspring.'' Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, "God turned them into monkeys because of their sins. They only lived on the earth for three days, for no transformed person ever lives more than three days. They did not eat, drink or have offspring. God transformed their shapes into monkeys, and He does what He wills, with whom He wills and He changes the shape of whomever He wills. On the other hand, God created the monkeys, swines and the rest of the creation in the six days (of creation) that He mentioned in His Book.''    God's statement,    [?????????????? ????????]    (So We made this punishment an example) means, God made the people of this village, who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath,    [????????]    (an example) via the way they were punished. Similarly, God said about Pharaoh,    [?????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ???????????? ]    (So God, seized him with punishing example for his last and first transgression) (79:25). nGod's statement,    [?????? ?????? ????????? ????? ?????????]    (for those in front of it and those behind it) meaning, for the other villages. Ibn `Abbas commented, "Meaning, `We made this village an example for the villages around it by the manner in which We punished its people.''' Similarly, God said,    [???????? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????????? ]    (And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of God ? Islamic Monotheism)).(46:27)    Therefore, God made them an example for those who lived during their time as well as a reminder for those to come, by preserving their story. This is why God said,    [???????????? ???????????????]    (and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious)), meaning, a reminder. This Ayah means, "The torment and punishment that this village suffered was a result of indulging in God's prohibitions and their deceit. Hence, those who have Taqwa should be aware of their evil behavior, so that what occurred to this village does not befall them as well.'' Also, Imam Abu `Abdullah bin Battah reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of God said,    ???? ???????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ????????? ????? ????????? ?????????    (Do not commit what the Jews committed, breaching what God has forbidden, by resorting to the lowest types of deceit.)    This Hadith has a good (Jayid) chain of narration. God knows best.    [?????? ????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ????????? ???? ??????? ???? ????????????? ]    (67. And (remember) when Musa said to his people: "Verily, God commands you that you slaughter a cow.'' They said, "Do you make fun of us'' He said, "I take God's refuge from being among Al-Jahilin (the ignorant or the foolish).'')    We are not moon worshipers...

An example, is the incident described in Numbers 15:32-36 (1).    Breaking the Sabbath was a very serious crime for the Children of Israel.|`|7109620c4225f326f10bda246dd6079daa	I have never seen that hadith that you quoted about rats but yes the Quran tells us that God punished some people for breaking the Sabbath by turning them into apes - however this isnt necessarily literal     "As for the substance of God's decree, "Be as apes despicable", the famous tabii [student of the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions] Mujahid explains it thus: '(Only) their hearts were transformed, that is, they were not (really) transformed into apes: this is but a metaphor (mathal) coined by God with regard to them, similar to the metaphor of 'the *** carrying books' (62:5)"...A similar explanation is given by Raghib. It should be borne in mind that the expression "like an ape" is often used in classical Arabic to describe a person who is unable to restrain his gross appetites or passions."      Do you not believe God punished people for their sins? You clearly aint read the Bible -doesnt t say Lots wife was turned into a pillar of salt    Although Islam rejects macro evolution its fascinating that a link between humans and apes was mentioned in the Quran  1300 years before Darwin      The Quran chapter 7    Heres the passage in full -its verse 166    159 Of the people of Moses there is a section who guide and do justice in the light of truth.     160 We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with your staff":[6] out of it there gushed forth twelve springs:[7] each group knew its own place for water. We caused the white cloud to overshadow them,[8] and sent down to them manna and quails,[9] saying: "Eat of the good things we have provided for you." They did no harm to us, but they harmed their own souls.    161 And remember it was said to them: Dwell in this town and eat in it as you wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: we shall forgive you your sins; we shall prosper those who do good.    162 But the transgressors among them altered what was said to them, so we sent on them a plague from heaven. For they repeatedly transgressed.    163 Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath.[10] For on the day of their Sabbath their fish came to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did we make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.      164 When some of them said: why do you preach to a people whom Allah will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment? Said the preachers: to discharge our duty to your Lord, and perhaps they may fear him.    165 When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, we rescued those who forbade evil; but we visited the wrongdoers with a grievous punishment, because they were given to transgression.    166 When in their insolence they transgressed all prohibitions, we said to them: be apes, despised and rejected.    167 Behold your Lord did declare that he would send against them, to the day of judgment, those who would affect them with grievous penalty. Your Lord is quick in retribution, but he is also oft-forgiving, most merciful.    168 We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: in order that they might turn.    169 After them a new generation arose: they inherited Al-Kitab, but they chose the vanities of this world, saying: We will be forgiven. If similar vanities came their way, they would seize them. Was not the covenant of Al-Kitab taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? Yet they study what is in it. Best for the righteous is the home of the hereafter. Will you not understand?    170 As to those who hold fast by Al-Kitab and establish regular prayer, never shall we suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.       Here is the explanation of these verses    "Under Mosaic Law, they were obliged to refrain from all work - and, therefore, also from fishing - on Sabbath-days, with the result that the fish were more plentiful and would come closer to the shore on those days: and the inhabitants of the town took this as an excuse to break the Sabbath-law."    Despite being warned against transgressing against the Sabbath law, they fished on the Sabbath anyway, and thus God decreed that they become "apes despicable." Now, many Muslims understand this in a literal sense, that God literally changed them into apes. That's possible. There are other commentators, however, that have a different explanation, as Muhammad Asad explained:    "As for the substance of God's decree, "Be as apes despicable", the famous tabii [student of the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions] Mujahid explains it thus: '(Only) their hearts were transformed, that is, they were not (really) transformed into apes: this is but a metaphor (mathal) coined by God with regard to them, similar to the metaphor of 'the *** carrying books' (62:5)"...A similar explanation is given by Raghib. It should be borne in mind that the expression "like an ape" is often used in classical Arabic to describe a person who is unable to restrain his gross appetites or passions."    So, it is possible that these Sabbath-breakers were not even turned into apes, and it was just an expression by God. Whatever the case may be, the point remains: the Qur'an does not call Jews "pigs and monkeys." It was talking about a specific ancient town in which Jews lived, and among them were people who broke the Sabbath law. And it was these specific people, after being repeatedly warned by God, who "became as apes despised." Let me say it again: there is no verse in the Qur'an that says Jews are "pigs and

Vocabulary is easy enough to learn with its repetitive picture+word+sound drills, but grammar is a lot harder.  You basically have to infer grammar.  If there is a word you don't get, look it up online...because it's probably a non-intuitive grammar point.  All in all, it helps learn a language, but be sure to supplement it with online help and books so you get a thorough introduction to the language.

AA10843652	I don't know any case in which somebody learned a language by just watching TV.  Some formal education may come in handy (particularly in grammar, verbal forms and genre stuff), but what I DO know TV is helpful with is getting accustomed to hear the language in real speed (that is, not in the usual slow speed made for learning) and, over all, gaining more vocabluary and learning slang.    Anyway, as spanish is not as easy as english, I think it may take you about 6 months to get accustomed to hear it -and understand it decently.     Songs are great for this too.    Some tips:   -Start with programs made for children.   They are intended to teach the language, so it's a good idea  -Next, try some subtitled programs, but try to focus on the speech rather than the subtitles.   Use them only for things you don't understand.  -Then, rent a movie and try watching it with no subtitles.   If there's something you don't understand, turn the subs on.    Hope this helps.

Treat her to a picnic in your house or something. be there for your girlfriend. ask her when her friend might be leaving. if she doesn't know tell her that if she keeps blowing you off that she may lose you. but before you do it make sure that she's really blowing you off instead of just trying to create some memories with her friend before she moves.   I know how you feel. try giving her kisses and hold her hand. when all of you are out, become the life of the party. be more outgoing and not so needy. play it more cool. and for your own personal self. try not to be so consumed with your girlfriend. do your own thing. it's not healthy for you to be consumed with one person (i don't know if you are or not) but if you are, really try to get more friends and spread yourself around. Then you can look at the situation more from an outside point of view.  good luck.|`|311cf3a0ac7f7692885271f765c10b46aa	Spare yourself from getting hurt more and just break up with her.

6180cf35bad0da9c353d9b5ee3909d90aa	Hallelujah, Halleluyah, or Alleluia, is a transliteration of the Hebrew word ???????????? (Standard Hebrew Hall?luya, Tiberian Hebrew Hall?l?yh) meaning "[Let us] praise (????????) Jah (Yah) (????)" (Sometimes rendered as "Praise (????????) [the] LORD (????)or God"). It is found mainly in the book of Psalms. It has been accepted into the English language. The word is used in Judaism as part of the Hallel prayers. Alleluia is the Latin form of the word; it is used by Catholics in preference to Hallelujah.    For most Christians, "Hallelujah" is considered the most joyful word of praise to God, rather than an injunction to praise Him. In many denominations, the Alleluia, along with the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, is not spoken or sung during the season of Lent, instead being replaced by a Lenten acclamation.    Halleluyah is a composite of Hallelu and Yah (Jah). It literally translates from Hebrew as "Praise Yah, [third-person plural]!" or simply "Praise Yah!" Yah is the shortened form of the name Yahweh (Jehovah), referred to as the Tetragrammaton.    The term is used about 24 times in the Hebrew Bible (mainly in the book of Psalms (e.g. 113-118), where it starts and concludes a number of Psalms) and four times in Greek transliteration in Revelation.|`|eb984df104c0247391c4aef82e51c827aa	it means "All hail Satan" in Aramic.|`|01909fee3655e32929e012c0d8b6e520aa	Praise the lord; rejoice...(.dictionary.com)|`|f70e5012cab0678fa2d9990f4484b696aa	Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy|`|5de507fa55f8c7f858f99c4037ad13f1aa	i dunno what the word means exactly but i know it's about praising god almighty or something.|`|1e7b9758dbbde4806869ee1a8a0e481baa	The word "halleluiah" is taken from the Hebrew scriptures and is used extensively in the psalms.

A better idea is to get passengers from all walks of life to understand that if someone tries to hijack their plane, they had better give their last drop of blood to put them down as otherwise they'll most likely be killed.  This applies regardless of whether or not Arabs are on the plane or are the hijackers.    Don't be a bigot, that only justifies extremist ideology.

There will be no excuses.  I'm a Christian.   Acts 11:27 in the bible says we are called Christians who believe.   Religious denominations won't get you to heaven.  Being a part of some certain church, doesn't guarantee entrance into heaven.  Only a personal relation with Jesus Christ will guarantee that.  Religion and traditions that are contrary to the bible  take away from the word of truth and then there's deception.

I was "turned off" at an early age (10).

The priest then went on to list how much money my Great Grandfather had given to the church with an actual dollar amount.|`|AA10018614	After leaving the Catholic faith and researching various other religious organizations I came to my personal conclusion that there exists to many contradictions and finger pointing regarding organized religions. I personally feel and believe that God is not as described in many religions and one only has to come to know God from within ones own Spirit.    I believe in many of the concrete contents of the Bible. Such as Jesus and the others that are portrayed. I question that accuracy of translation and meaning.     I now consider myself to be Spiritual.  I believe God loves all and that many requirements that are created by many organized religions, are simply created by man to maintain that fear and control thus the continued existence of any particular religious organization.    I do not see anything wrong with religion if that is what one declares to be their truth. It just isn't mine

041e6252efb55962f9628b5aef9cc230aa	H um timo texto que exclarece bem esta quest?o:    FATALIDADE (Predestina??o)    851. H uma fatalidade nos acontecimentos da vida, segundo o sentido ligado a essa palavra; quer dizer, todos os acontecimentos s?o predeterminados, e nesse caso em que se torna o livre arbtrio?  -- A fatalidade n?o existe sen?o para a escolha feita pelo Esprito, ao encarnar-se, de sofrer esta ou aquela prova; ao escolh-la, ele tra?a para si mesmo uma espcie de destino, que  a prpria conseqncia da posi??o em que se encontra. Falo das provas de natureza fsica, porque, no tocante s provas morais e s tenta??es, o Esprito, conservando o seu livre arbtrio sobre o bem e o mal,  sempre senhor de ceder ou resistir. Um bom Esprito, ao v-lo fraquejar, pode correr em seu auxlio mas n?o pode influir sobre ele a ponto de subjugar-lhe a vontade. Um Esprito mau, ou seja, inferior, ao lhe mostrar ou exagerar um perigo fsico pode abal-lo e assust-lo, mas a vontade do Esprito encarnado n?o fica por isso menos livre de qualquer entrave.    852. H pessoas que parecem perseguidas por uma fatalidade, independentemente de sua maneira de agir; a desgra?a est no seu destino?  -- S?o, talvez, provas que devem sofrer e que elas mesmas escolheram. Ainda uma vez levais  conta do destino o que , quase sempre, a conseqncia de vossa prpria falta. Em meio dos males que te afligem, cuida que a tua conscincia esteja pura e te sentirs mais ou menos consolado.    As idias justas ou falsas que fazemos das coisas nos levam a vencer ou fracassar, segundo o nosso carter e a nossa posi??o social. Achamos mais simples e menos humilhante para o nosso amor-prprio atribuir os nossos fracassos  sorte ou ao destino, do que a ns mesmos. Se a influncia dos Espritos contribui algumas vezes para isso, podemos sempre nos subtrair a ela, repelindo as idias ms que nos forem sugeridas.    853. Certas pessoas escapam a um perigo mortal para cair em outro; parece que n?o podem escapar  morte. N?o h nisso fatalidade?  -- Fatal, no verdadeiro sentido da palavra, s o instante da morte. Chegado esse momento, de uma forma ou de outra, a ele n?o podeis furtar-vos.    853-a. Assim, qualquer que seja o perigo que nos ameace, n?o morreremos se a nossa hora n?o chegou?  -- N?o, n?o morrers, e tens disso milhares de exemplos. Mas quando chegar a tua hora de partir, nada te livrar. Deus sabe com antecedncia qual o gnero de morte por que partirs daqui, e freqentemente teu Esprito tambm o sabe, pois isso lhe foi revelado quando fez a escolha desta ou daquela existncia.    854. Da infalibilidade da hora da morte segue-se que as precau??es que se tomam para evit-la s?o inteis?  -- N?o, porque as precau??es que tomais vos s?o sugeridas com o fim de evitar a morte que vos amea?a; s?o um dos meios para que ela n?o se verifique.    855. Qual o fito da Providncia, ao fazer-nos correr perigos que n?o devem ter conseqncias?  -- Quando tua vida se encontra em perigo  essa uma advertncia que tu mesmo desejaste, a fim de te desviar do mal e te tornar melhor. Quando escapas a esse perigo, ainda sob a influncia do risco por que passaste, pensas com maior ou menor intensidade, sob a a??o mais ou menos forte dos bons Espritos, em te tornares melhor. O mau Esprito retornando (digo mau, subentendendo o mal que ainda nele existe), pensas que escapars da mesma maneira a outros perigos e deixas que as tuas paix?es se desencadeiem de novo. Pelos perigos que correis, Deus vos recorda a vossa fraqueza e a fragilidade de vossa existncia. Se examinarmos a causa e a natureza do perigo, veremos que, na maioria das vezes, as conseqncias foram a puni??o de uma falta cometida ou de um dever negligenciado. Deus vos adverte para refletirdes sobre vs mesmos e vos emendardes. (Ver os itens 526 a 532)[62].    856. O Esprito sabe, por antecipa??o, qual o gnero de morte que deve sofrer?  -- Sabe que o gnero de vida por ele escolhido o exp?e a morrer mais de uma maneira que de outra. Mas sabe tambm quais as lutas que ter de sustentar para o evitar, e que, se Deus o permitir, n?o sucumbir.    857. H homens que enfrentam os perigos dos combates com uma certa convic??o de que a sua hora n?o chegou; h algum fundamento nessa confian?a?  -- Com muita freqncia o homem tem o pressentimento do seu fim, como o pode ter o de que ainda n?o morrer. Esse pressentimento lhe  dado pelos seus Espritos protetores, que desejam adverti-lo para que esteja pronto a partir ou reerguem a sua coragem nos momentos em que se faz mais necessrio. Tambm lhe pode vir da intui??o da existncia por ele escolhida, ou da miss?o que aceitou e sabe que deve cumprir. (Ver itens 411 a 522).    858. Os que pressentem a morte geralmente a temem menos do que os outros? Por qu?  --  o homem que teme a morte, n?o o Esprito. Aquele que a pressente pensa mais como Esprito do que como homem: compreende a sua liberta??o e a espera.    859. Se a morte n?o pode ser evitada quando chega a sua hora, acontece o mesmo com todos os acidentes no curso da nossa vida?  -- S?o, em geral, coisas demasiado pequenas, das quais podemos prevenir-vos dirigindo o vosso pensamento no sentido de as evitardes, porque n?o gostamos do sofrimento material. Mas isso  de pouca importancia para o curso da vida que escolhestes. A fatalidade s consiste nestas duas horas: aquelas em que deveis aparecer e desaparecer neste mundo.    859-a. H fatos que devem ocorrer for?osamente e que a vontade dos Espritos n?o pode conjurar?  -- Sim, mas que tu, quando no estado de Esprito, viste e pressentiste, ao fazer a tua escolha.

As crazy as a comment as that is I believe it to be true.  It is a natural human response to given stressful situations or people.  Hating is useful to a person in the same way stereotyping is.  It might be considered socially wrong, but stereotypes are the brains way to make quick decisions or opinions about an object or person.      Hate also has its reasons for existing.  Survival in the past and even in present day sometimes depends on hate.  You may not realize it in your glass tower(I you live in the US like me this is mostly true), but the outside world is harsh.  An example of useful hate would be when a nation fights another.  If is an actual war then you will obviously find people who hate the other side.  Note that you only have people who hate their own government causing the war if that nation gives its citizen the luxery to.  It is also a strong motivator.  If your father was killed by the other side you hate them and fight harder, worker harder, and work longer.  There are also reasons for hate in a peaceful nation like the US.  If you have an interview for an important job and someone less talented gets it, it acts as a motivator.  This motivation could be working harder, learning new skills, or even pursueing alternative routes to the top.      I also think that hate is useful in that it rewires your brain.  Ever noticed how when a person whom you hate is slighted in any way it feels good?  I think that the pleasure centers in your brain begin to respond to any stimuli that might negatively affect the target of your hate.  Because of this everything including from your opinions to the way you think changes because of this.    When it comes down to it I think Hate is a stronger motivator than greed, fear, or pain.  Of course I doubt you will this to or read any of this since I think that you might hate, hate itself.

First when a Christian person does something wrong, it does not mean that the person was practicing Christianity at that moment.  Even the Apostle Paul said that he was susceptible to doing wrong things.    Some Christians do not interpret Christianity correctly.  For example, some Christians believe that it is okay to bomb an abortion center.  In the Bible I can not find much justification for those actions.    Ofcourse, when a Christian does something wrong, there are those who take this as an opportunity to condemn Christianity, rather than the individual who was at fault.  As a Christian, I do not believe that it was Jesus' fault when that minister got sex drugs and a "massage" from a male "escort."  It was his own fault.  His actions are not supported in Christianty.    In the Bible there are married ministers, even Peter.  If fornication, adultery, and child molestation are the results of a Christian minister's beliefs that he should suppress the desire to get married, then it is not the fault of Christianity.      In conclusion it is an error in logic to attack Christianity when Christians act counter to the teachings.|`|df1e25bc62c0a22b0eb48b2c14152849aa	I think a slap in the face is something any god fearing Christian could use.....|`|762d085da61909919ac6eac86711fc50aa	Some of them,yes.But then there are times that the argument isn't a version of the "no true Scotsman" fallacy.    http://www.tektonics.org/guest/scotty.ht...|`|601d1f5597fa8581013817dd46d2d39caa	They certainly need something.

The name Easter is derived from the Goddess Oestare, Ostern, Eostra or Eostre, depending on what literature you read.. Even the word "oestrogen" the female hormone, can claim its roots in the name of this fertility Goddess.. The fertility aspect of Ostara is symbolised by the egg, stolen by the Christians and integrated into their Easter festival , which was also stolen from the Pagans .. It was originally the Festival of Ostara,the festival of fertility celebrated at the time of the Venal Equinox in the Northern Hemisphere..It was all about Life, Death ,Rebirth... That's how the Christian Easter came about.. They assimilated it.. The rabbit was also a fertility symbol to the Pagans of the time.. While we are on Easter.. Even the hot cross buns can be traced to pre-Christian times.. At the Feast of Oestre, an ox was sacrificed..The ox horns symbolised the Feast and were carved into the ritual bread.. The the symmetrical cross is still used today.. Although the Christians claim it's the cross of Jesus, it wasn't originally..

The ancient Celts believed the rabbit was in the moon. The moon hare would lay eggs for the children to eat. This is the orgin of the Easter Bunny, a sacred animal. (2)    Origins of the name "Easter":    The name "Easter" originated with the names of an ancient Goddess and God. The Venerable Bede, (672-735 CE.) a Christian scholar, first asserted in his book De Ratione Temporum that Easter was named after Eostre (a.k.a. Eastre). She was the Great Mother Goddess of the Saxon people in Northern Europe.  Similarly, the "Teutonic dawn goddess of fertility [was] known variously as Ostare, Ostara, Ostern, Eostra, Eostre, Eostur, Eastra, Eastur, Austron and Ausos." 1 Her name was derived from the ancient word for spring: "eastre." Similar Goddesses were known by other names in ancient cultures around the Mediterranean, and were celebrated in the springtime. Some were:  bullet Aphrodite from ancient Cyprus  bullet Ashtoreth from ancient Israel  bullet Astart from ancient Greece  bullet Demeter from Mycenae  bullet Hathor from ancient Egypt  bullet Ishtar from Assyria  bullet Kali, from India  bullet Ostara a Norse Goddess of fertility.    An alternative explanation has been suggested. The name given by the Frankish church to Jesus' resurrection festival included the Latin word "alba" which means "white." (This was a reference to the white robes that were worn during the festival.) "Alba" also has a second meaning: "sunrise." When the name of the festival was translated into German, the "sunrise" meaning was selected in error. This became "ostern" in German. Ostern has been proposed as the origin of the word "Easter". 2  There are two popular beliefs about the origin of the English word "Sunday."  bullet It is derived from the name of the Scandinavian sun Goddess Sunna (a.k.a. Sunne, Frau Sonne). 5,6  bullet It is derived from "Sol," the Roman God of the Sun." Their phrase "Dies Solis" means "day of the Sun." The Christian saint Jerome (d. 420) commented "If it is called the day of the sun by the pagans, we willingly accept this name, for on this day the Light of the world arose, on this day the Sun of Justice shone forth." 7    horizontal rule    Click below to visit one of our sponsors:    horizontal rule  Pagan origins of Easter:    Many, perhaps most, Pagan religions in the Mediterranean area had a major seasonal day of religious celebration at or following the Spring Equinox. Cybele, the Phrygian fertility goddess, had a fictional consort who was believed to have been born via a virgin birth. He was Attis, who was believed to have died and been resurrected each year during the period MAR-22 to MAR-25. "About 200 B.C. mystery cults began to appear in Rome just as they had earlier in Greece. Most notable was the Cybele cult centered on Vatican hill ...Associated with the Cybele cult was that of her lover, Attis (the older Tammuz, Osiris, Dionysus, or Orpheus under a new name). He was a god of ever-reviving vegetation. Born of a virgin, he died and was reborn annually. The festival began as a day of blood on Black Friday and culminated after three days in a day of rejoicing over the resurrection." 3    Wherever Christian worship of Jesus and Pagan worship of Attis were active in the same geographical area in ancient times, Christians "used to celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus on the same date; and pagans and Christians used to quarrel bitterly about which of their gods was the true prototype and which the imitation."    Many religious historians believe that the death and resurrection legends were first associated with Attis, many centuries before the birth of Jesus. They were simply grafted onto stories of Jesus' life in order to make Christian theology more acceptable to Pagans. Others suggest that many of the events in Jesus' life that were recorded in the gospels were lifted from the life of Krishna, the second person of the Hindu Trinity. Ancient Christians had an alternative explanation; they claimed that Satan had created counterfeit deities in advance of the coming of Christ in order to confuse humanity. 4 Modern-day Christians generally regard the Attis legend as being a Pagan myth of little value. They regard Jesus' death and resurrection account as being true, and unrelated to the earlier tradition.    Wiccans and other modern-day Neopagans continue to celebrate the Spring Equinox as one of their 8 yearly Sabbats (holy days of celebration). Near the Mediterranean, this is a time of sprouting of the summer's crop; farther north, it is the time for seeding. Their rituals at the Spring Equinox are related primarily to the fertility of the crops and to the balance of the day and night times. Where Wiccans can safely celebrate the Sabbat out of doors without threat of religious persecution, they often incorporate a bonfire into their rituals, jumping over the dying embers is believed to assure fertility of people and crops.    horizontal rule  References used in the above essay:       1.

9421c52ff88e332018d695cdf5fa1e96aa	Sex only sells because society makes people thing being naked and having sex is "bad" or "wrong".  If people would stop getting bent out of shape when they see a naked body and realize it is natural, it wouldn't sell so well.    The silly part is that bible thumpers are the ones that try to make sex and nudity bad, when they should promote it.  Think about it, when god made adam and eve, he didn't give them clothes.  They became ashamed of thier body and covered up after the original sin of eating the apple.

God wants you to be naked and have sex, why else would it be the way to procreate and continue our species. "    in response to this:  the "bible thumpers" don't try to make sex and nudity bad. true Christians understand that sex is a wonderfully sacred thing that should only be shared between a man and woman that have been made one by God himself...not the whore you hired on the street or some random chick you had a one-night stand with..or even that person you swore you were going to marry but ended up breaking up with. you must understand that sex is perfectly okay, that is, when you are married to the person. Nudity, on the other hand, is not okay because though there may be people out there, like yourself, who see the human body as a natural thing, there are many men and women out there who see it as a way to lust. the reason it is wrong is because many times these men and women are married or in relationships (and nobody should be lusting to begin with) and as it is stated in the book of matthew (i think) "if you have sinned in the flesh(eyes,skin,or w/e) you have sinned in your heart."..or something like that.had adam and eve not committed the first sin, we'd all be walking around naked and other and men could look at those naked women without getting any boners.    in response to the original question:  there IS too much lust in society. the sad part is, that everyone seems to be okay with it. but i'm not. i feel that if men and women alike are ever truly in love they would not lust at others because not only is it wrong, but you shouldn't do it out of respect towards your partner. i'm 15 years old. i'm currently doing an expository essay on increasing lust in society. turns out more than 50% of people are now getting divorces(which studies show that when their children reach ages of adulthood they begin to have problems with relationships). more kids are being exposed to sex at an early age (which turns out to distort unready minds causing homosexuality in the younger ones), the pregnancy rate is down..but i read an article about a bunch of 4th-6th graders fornicating at the back of the school bus.   you can't tell me people learn to live this way by reading the bible and having family game nights..  sometimes i wonder whether i'm the only one seeing how much our society is turning into crap just because everyone wants to have sex.  the media is distroying our morals.

Non si appoggiano i gomiti sul tavolo e le braccia devono essere il pi possibile accostate per non disturbare i commensali.   La minestra pu essere presa solo da un lato del cucchiaio e assolutamente non dalla punta (non si deve fare il risucchio!!!!).   Si deve cercare di evitare di fare rumore masticando (e si mastica solo a bocca chiusa).   Non si usano gli stuzzicadenti in pubblico.  Addirittura sapevo che non si mettono gli stuzzicadenti in tavola.  Non si pu bere mentre si ha ancora del cibo in bocca.   Prima di bere bisogna fare sempre attenzione al fatto che la bocca deve risultare perfettamente pulita.   Un'altra cosa che non si deve fare (e io a volte la faccio!!!)

lrg5ceYUaa	Penso che l'unico problema sta nel fatto che certe verit sono scomode e altre no ...    La Chiesa cattolica - io per nascita sono cattolico - perdura da 17 secoli grazie all'idea geniale di un imperatore romano, Costantino, ed  stato il primo pontefice:     si  convertito  perch gli serviva una religione per mantenere unito l'Impero ... e la religione "Cristiana" ... (ma era sul serio quella cristiana - ossia un ebraismo ortodosso - oppure una religione pseudo ebrea?) ... era adatta a gonglobare le religioni presenti sul territorio dell'Impero, e per questo  stata scelta per divenire la Religione di Stato ...    Se questo imperatore non si fosse mai convertito, probabilmente noi ora saremmo fedeli del Dio Mitra, di Iside e Osiride, oppure di Amon, oppure di qualche divinit celtica, pagana, o, pi semplicemente, seguiremmo una religione come quella Catara, molto pi simile, per messaggio e tipo di fede,  a quella intesa da Ges ...    Qualsiasi messaggio che smente i dogmi sulla quale la Chiesa si fonda, deve essere ignorato, proprio perch demolirebbe un credo che perdura da poco pi di un millennio e mezzo!    Ecco perch la Chiesa vieta la divinazione, le visioni e qualsiasi manifestazione che possa in qualche modo contraddire, se fosse vera,  quelli che sono i precetti imposti dal 300 d. C., ma al tempo stesso cerca di incoraggiare tutto quello che pu invece rafforzare il credo religioso dei suoi fedeli ... come  umanamente, e non divinamente, plausibile ...|`|1bd923f06c9cde1cc57ee684b51c2faaaa	credo che ci sia una aprte del nostro cervello poichintrappolato nella materia non si utilizzato appieno....noi sentiamo e percepiamo cose chi piu chi meno forse lei ha percepito, qualcosa in piu degli altri quando un fulmine colpiva un ramo e questi si incendiava e noi uomini ancora non sapevamo il perch si diceva che il Signore o il Dio era arrabbiato con noi poi scoperto l'arcano abbiamo tolto il fastidio a dio di una cosa naturale... questo come esempio chi ha preveggenze o come dici tu profezie forse ha in se una dote che sfrutta meglio di altri... credo... poi non so|`|2307cfb4991a877bd8f9e4d844dfbf2caa	Io nelle profezie ci credo...cmq credo ke in piccolo tutti siamo "profeti" di noi stessi...

El ingls es una de las lenguas ms habladas del mundo, y no slo con angloparlantes nativos, como el caso de los americanos y los propios ingleses, sino que es la segunda lengua de muchas personas alrededor del mundo, como es mi caso.    A qu me refiero con la necesidad... usualmente el idioma que predomina en las comunicaciones internacionales es el ingls, por eso es fcil para los que la tienen como su lengua nativa comunicarse con todo el mundo sin necesidad de utilizar otro idioma. No creo que se trate de que "no comprendan slo ingls", como dices t, sino que ms bien, no es muy sentida para ellos la necesidad de aprender otro idioma, como si es el caso de los que hablamos otros idiomas y vivimos en otras regiones.    Saludos!!!      P.D. Una aclaracin para algunos, segn unas respuestas un poco parcas que le: Es muy cierto que americanos somos todos los nacidos en America, aparte de los Estadounidenses, pero si son un poco ms comprensivos, la palabra en Ingls para "Estadounidense" es "American", y quien pregunta hace la traduccin literal del ingls al espa?ol.

It might be that the average ignorant american is the one that doesn't wants to learn another language.  Actually my boyfriend speaks German and Spanish...sooooo I guess its who you hang out with.
AA10781920	No, but generally I don't out myself to new people until I've known them a little while. I don't really feel my sex life is anyone's business.     I find that guys have a hard time taking me seriously when I tell them I'm a lesbian. They all seem to suffer from the "magic penis" delusion: one roll in the hay with them and I'll be straightened right out.|`|d09f9f421df80c0b6d67a419cfaa9464aa	I meet regularly for lunch with a group of ladies.

Almost all of my old friends abandoned me after they found out.  I don't have that many friends, but I have a few who really don't care.  They are straight girls, and they're cool hanging out with me.  I have almost no guy friends because I will make a guy friend and then he'll realize for sure that I'll never date him and he'll just move on and forget about me.  They always try.  I always feel betrayed too, because it tells me that they weren't nice to me because they want to be my friend, it's because they wanted sex or something.  They also don't respect the fact that I am gay.|`|262b79f4ef122984a37610d6dc650c76aa	I'm not sure how to compare if it's more difficult for me being a lesbian to make friends than a straight woman, since I've only experienced being a lesbian, you know?    But I don't seem to have trouble making friends in the workplace.     Even though I am out at work, I don't exactly wear a "Hi, I'm gay" nametag, so it tends to come as a surprise to co-workers when the topic comes up. People here just sort of say, "oh" and then rephrase their question using the other gender's pronouns.    I have run across two or three people who have declined to continue our friendship on religious/moral grounds once they find out I'm a lesbian. I respect their decision, and think we are both better off that way. After all, conditional friends aren't really friends.    As to making friends with guys? Again, it seems to me to be no problem. I have a good group of guy friends from college, and a number of guy friends at work. It's been a very long time since any guy friend made a move on me. But I think that's because I tend to choose respectful people as friends, you know?    I think as one gets older (I'm nearly 38), one's sexual orientation becomes less and less of a factor in making friends of any stripe, particularly for those of us who have been off the market for a long time.    Hope that helps.|`|361c160131c0b875230e72e3748f4b89aa	I have read this three times - I don't see your point.    Why would me being gay limit me making friends?    What IS your point?        OH, IS THAT HOW IT WORKS? THANKS FOR THAT.    MY POINT IS THAT YOUR QUESTION IS RATHER STUPID.    .|`|fae8f4219702dced3d09a00b1df2c326aa	I think it all depends on where you live and what people you come in contact with.  There's no need to out yourself when you first meet someone.  I don't mean hide who you are, but you just don't introduce yourself that way.  I do have more guy friends, but I think that's based on shared interests.

Un futuro seguro... cmo usted puede obtenerlo    PERSONAS de toda condicin social verdaderamente desean seguridad. Sin duda eso es lo que usted anhela para usted mismo y sus amados. La mayora de las personas quieren ms que solo una promesa de que en algn tiempo en el futuro indefinido vendrn mejores condiciones. Ahora mismo nos enfrentamos a urgentes problemas de la vida. Lo que se necesita es algo que suministre seguridad genuina ahora y que contine hacindolo en los a?os del ma?ana. ?Es posible tal seguridad?    2 Hay personas de todas las razas, que viven en todas partes de la Tierra, que creen que eso es posible. La seguridad en que ellos se interesan fue descrita hace mucho por un profeta inspirado por Dios, quien escribi: La obra de la justicia verdadera tiene que llegar a ser paz; y el servicio de la justicia verdadera, tranquilidad y seguridad hasta tiempo indefinido. Y mi pueblo tiene que morar en un lugar de habitacin pacfico y en residencias de plena confianza y en lugares de descanso sosegados. (Isaas 32:17, 18) Centenares de miles de personas en todas partes de la Tierra ya estn comenzando a disfrutar de seguridad pacfica a pesar de la actual inquietud mundial, y tienen razn para mirar con confianza a un porvenir aun ms brillante. Usted tambin puede compartir esos beneficios con ellos.    3 Estas personas esperan el tiempo, ya muy cercano, en el que no habr nadie que haga temblar a la gente... un tiempo en el que se pondr fin al crimen, fin al peligro en que se halla la propiedad de uno y la persona de uno. (Miqueas 4:4) Tienen razn slida para creer que muchas personas que ahora viven vern el da en el que ya no habr ms hambre, debido a que llegar a haber abundancia de grano en la tierra. (Salmo 72:16) Y confan en que podrn ver el cumplimiento de la promesa de que Dios limpiar toda lgrima de sus ojos, y la muerte no ser ms, ni existir ya ms lamento ni clamor ni dolor. Las cosas anteriores han pasado. (Revelacin 21:3, 4) ?Cmo pueden estar tan seguros de que esas cosas verdaderamente sucedern? Esto se debe a que esas promesas se encuentran en la propia Palabra de Dios, la Biblia.    4 Lo que la Biblia dice acerca de nuestro porvenir no es sencillamente el resultado de esfuerzos humanos por interpretar las tendencias de la historia. Se us a hombres para escribir, pero la mente de stos fue dirigida por el espritu de Dios. Por lo tanto, el mensaje es de Dios. De la fuente de su contenido, la Biblia misma dice: Ninguna profeca de la Escritura proviene de interpretacin privada alguna. Porque la profeca no fue trada en ningn tiempo por la voluntad del hombre, sino que hombres hablaron de parte de Dios al ser llevados por espritu santo. (2 Pedro 1:20, 21) No debera ser difcil para nosotros hoy en da entender cmo Dios podra hacer esto. Hasta hombres al viajar por el espacio sideral han enviado mensajes de vuelta a la Tierra, y stos se han recibido con extraordinaria claridad. ?No podra Dios en el cielo, de una manera muy superior, haber transmitido mensajes a hombres fieles que estaban en armona con l? ?Ciertamente! Con buena razn, pues, le invitamos a examinar lo que la Biblia dice acerca de cmo usted puede obtener un futuro seguro.    El lugar donde se puede hallar verdadera ayuda    5 La Biblia nos ayuda a ver la vida de una manera prctica y apegada a la realidad. Con miras a nuestro bienestar duradero, nos insta a poner nuestra confianza en aquello que perdurar. Hoy millones de personas ponen su confianza en las posesiones materiales. La Biblia, aunque reconoce el valor del dinero y otras posesiones materiales, muestra que stas no son las cosas importantes en la vida. Declara la innegable verdad de que aun cuando uno tenga en abundancia, su vida no resulta de las cosas que posee. (Lucas 12:15) Las posesiones pueden perder su valor. Pueden ser robadas o destruidas. La vida del due?o puede ser puesta en peligro por alguien que est tratando de robar su dinero. La seguridad verdadera debe hallarse en otra parte. Pero, ?dnde?    6 Hay personas que basan todas sus esperanzas para el futuro en lo que los lderes humanos prometen. ?Pero debera usted hacer eso? Sin siquiera poner en tela de juicio la honradez o la capacidad de los lderes individuales, la Biblia llega al fondo del asunto recordndonos que todos ellos mueren. Sabiamente advierte: No cifren su confianza en nobles, ni en el hijo del hombre terrestre, a quien no pertenece salvacin alguna. Sale su espritu, l vuelve a su suelo; en ese da de veras perecen sus pensamientos. (Salmo 146:3, 4) De modo que, a lo ms, los lderes humanos influyen en los asuntos de un sector de la humanidad por solamente unos cuantos a?os. En cuanto a seguridad duradera, ellos no pueden proporcionrsela a usted, tal como no pueden suministrrsela a s mismos.    7 Pero hay Uno que puede proporcionarla. Es el Creador de los cielos y la Tierra. Antes de que esta Tierra fuera formada, l exista; y mucho despus que haya pasado este siglo veinte, l continuar existiendo. Como le dice el Salmo 90:2: Aun desde tiempo indefinido hasta tiempo indefinido t eres Dios. l es la Fuente de la vida y Aquel que le ha dado a la Tierra la capacidad para mantener las cosas vivas. Por lo tanto, nuestro bienestar presente y nuestras expectativas para el futuro dependen de l. Es por eso que necesitamos una buena relacin con l si es que vamos a disfrutar de seguridad verdadera alguna.    8 ?Significa esto que todo lo que se necesita en la vida es tener un grado de religin? Sera un error el llegar a esa conclusin. Dios solo concede una relacin favorable con l a cierta clase de personas. ?Qu clase? La Biblia l|`|q0Ih2QWFaa	Hola me anima este pensamiento que alguien me comparti, Dios busc en todo el universo algo de mucho valor con el cual pudiera comprar la redencin del hombre, y no lo hall, as que envi a su Hijo para que muriera por ti en la cruz del calvario, "Y si Dios no escatim, ni aun a su propio Hijo sino que lo envi a morir por nosotros, ?Cmo no nos dar tambin con l TODAS LAS COSAS?.

AA11741469	Well, if you look up the word "delusion" in wikipedia, the definition is: a belief that is either false, fanciful or derived from deception.    Okay let's see here...  1. false - well we can certainly use historical, archaelogical, geological, etc. type evidence to show that some religious things are false    2. fanciful - well hoping that there is some giant in the sky waiting to take you to a place with streets paved of gold, and all the other crazy things believed in the Bible is certainly fanciful    3. derived from deception - gee, that sure sounds like indoctrination to me; and perhaps the fire and brimstone argument works as a deception just as well    In conclusion, I guess I would have to agree that faith, or religious belief, is just about a synonym for the word "delusion". Good call.|`|dcPnmMNRaa	Dear Friend,    Gods word the bible defines faith thus:    Hebrews 11:1  [ By Faith ] Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.

Faith can be placed in a person, inanimate object, state of affairs, proposition or body of propositions such as a religious creed.  I would like to draw your attention to the fact this works both ways .you belive that i am deluded.I believe you are.you believe i have a persistant false belief in God. I believe you have a persistant false belief in your self.you say i have no proof of His existance,I say he is as real to me as you are,he saved me from the delusion that i could run my life upon my own reason and rationality.and guides me in making good choices on a daily basis,I have the peace that passeth understanding.  niether one of us can prove the other wrong. you have FAITH that your position is correct.I have faith that i am. we,ll both find out in the end which was right. If i,m not i won,t know. If you,re not you,ll know for eternity.  praying for you.>    msscarle  actually brought up a good point .as im sure you know. faith in God is about building trust in a relationship,after years of Him proving himself trust worthy in the relationship I have a firm unshakeable faith in Him.|`|AA11744086	Because people's eyes are blinded.

The American Heritage Dictionary defines faith as follows: Faith a noun: A confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing. I looked up several other sites and the definition was pretty much the same. I could not however, find the definitions that you gave. Since you do not cite the source of your definitions I would guess that you either 1. made then up yourself, or 2. took them from something written by Richard Dawkins.  Faith is not simply applied to Christians. I have faith that my husband loves me and is true to me because of his trustworthiness and loyalty for many years. I have faith that my son will do the right things in life because the way he conducts himself has lead me to believe in and have faith in him. I also have faith in Christ because of the things that he has done in my life. I don't have a problem at all with the fact that you don't believe as it is your choice. I do have a problem with atheist who twist definitions to suit their agenda and then present it as fact without citing a source to back up their definition.|`|fE8CFdPIaa	It is hard for many to accept the definition of faith you gave there (which I also hold to be true) because "many" are primitive, irrational creatures who would rather stand by the nonsense passed to them by their parents as a child (or by peers when older, if they happen to be even more stupid) than any kind of logic expressed to them at a later stage.    Or to put it the short way.... they don't accept it because they refuse to even give it a moment's consideration.|`|1d363f03d60fb308080ce24ce83cc10baa	MATTER: The Other Name for Illusion    What is explained in this book is an important truth, which has surprised many and changed their perspectives on life. This truth can be summarized as follows: "All events and objects that we encounter in real life-buildings, people, cities, cars, places-in fact, everything we see, hold, touch, smell, taste and hear-come into existence as visions and feelings in our brains".    We are taught to think that these images and feelings are caused by a solid world outside of our brains, where material things exist. However, in reality we never see real existing materials and we never touch real materials. In other words, every material entity which we believe exists in our lives, is, in fact, only a vision which is created in our brains.     This is not a philosophical speculation. It is an empirical fact that has been proven by modern science. Today, any scientist who is a specialist in medicine, biology, neurology or any other field related to brain research would say, when asked how and where we see the world, that we see the whole world in the vision center located in our brains.     This fact has been scientifically proven in the twentieth century, and although it may seem surprising, it necessarily implies answers to two questions; "If our lives are visions created in our brains, then who is it that creates these visions? And who is it that sees these visions in our brains without having eyes and enjoys them, gets excited and happy?" You will find the answers to these two important questions in this book.   http://www.harunyahya.com/matter.php.......

d49c0d0530aaf393f63cca94d814c4d0aa	I love it.  I got a free sample at an English as a second language (ESL) conference.  It really is a good program, but it does take up a lot of memory on your computer.|`|qbQT7oMtaa	I tried Rosetta Stone for Spanish. It was effective to learn basic words and sentences. It does not have any grammar or conjugation instructions though so it will be very hard to go beyond the basics with it    My college uses another software called TeLL me More, by Auralog. I found it more complete and less repetitive. It covers not only the basics, but also intermediate or advanced level. My goal was to become fluent so it was perfect for me. It has a lot of different activities: picture/word association, videos, dialogues,..., includes also grammar and conjugation. It has also more content than Rosetta Stone as far as level and number of hours of learning. Their speech recogntion is great so you can have a dialogue with the computer. They have a free demo at http://www.auralog.com/.   For independent reviews, you could check out http://learn-spanish-software-review.top... or the about.com websites (http://spanish.about.com,...)     The best way to learn a language would be through immersion, visiting these countries. Learning a language will require some time. In addition to software, you can have books which are useful as well. Audio CDs like Pimsleur for instance might help you out but you cannot get any feedback on your pronunciation so I did not like it so much.|`|7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	I tried the demo for a language that I knew nothing about -- Arabic.

But I was/am impressed with it!|`|AA11509905	It's the best software if you are looking at learning a foreign language.|`|OFxWsbMIaa	It's good if you have no background in the language.  It's extremely basic, but you do learn without thinking in English, because you're always just looking at pictures.  I think it's really overpriced; it doesn't need to be 500 bucks.|`|9uimM9znaa	Ok, "Rosetta Stone" has been used since then, but it really dates back to 1798, when French troops discovered a part of a monument, written partially in Greek (known, of course), partially in demotic Greek (partly known) and partlially in hieroglyphics in a language then thought lost.    Back in Paris, a linguist named Champollion, realising that the classical and demotic Greek texts meant the same thing, made the reasonable assumption that the hieroglyphics were the same text in that unknown language.    There are lots of technical details here, but the end result was a key to the language and writing of the people who built the pyramids.
31e3e41e921ac26f4d4f04e1526526d4aa	Might it have been "Eschew Obfuscation" ?    Eschew means avoid, keep away from.  Obfuscation is the act of concealing something to make it harder to understand, like misdirection or using a code.    So it's a very complicated way of saying "Keep it simple".|`|7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	Eschew means to abstain or keep away from; shun; avoid  Obtuseatic isn't a word in the English language.

In law, a hypothetical question is one that compromises an imaginary situation incorporating facts about the case.    So..your question is?

lrg5ceYUaa	Quello che  grave non  che ti abbiano chiesto dei soldi .... la loro dottrina prevede che uno debba spendere dei soldi per diventare un puro, ma la cosa grave  che esistano delle organizzazioni pseudo religiose che pretendano denaro in cambio di una cosa che dovrebbe essere gratuita.     Mi sembra di ricordare che un 15 anni fa, in Italia, proprio i dianetici, ossia scentology, erano stati chiamati a rispondere del reato di circonvenzione di incapace, perch molte famiglie si erano rovinate, o avevano fatto debiti, per sostenere le spese che affrontavano i figli per seguire i corsi della chiesa e, come tutte le organizzazioni pseudo religiose a fini di lucro, penso che i processi non sono arrivati a nulla di fatto perch a molte delle vittime era stato fatto letteralmente il lavaggio del cervello.    Che sia tutta una menata,  dimostrato dal fatto che il movimento dei dianetici nasce dall'idea di alcuni collaboratori di uno scrittore di fantascienza, tale Ron Hubbard ... o una cosa cos ... che hanno intravvisto nelle idee e nei racconti di questo fantasioso e famoso scrittore, una nuova visione della vita.    Poco prima che nascesse questa setta, Ron Hubbard ... o come si scrive ... si  suicidato!    Quando ho chiesto (io sono un bastardone) ai dianetici per quale motivo una mente cos brillante, che pretendeva di aver raggiunto il massimo grado della conoscenza con i suoi metodi, gli stessi che i dianetici propongono nei loro corsi, si fosse ammazzato, perch pare che le indagini hanno portato a questo, mi  stato detto che ormai "era troppo intelligente ed evoluto per continuare a vivere su questa terra" ... Questo significa che se volete iscrivervi a dianetics, saprete di aver raggiunto il limite massimo della conoscenza ed evoluzione umana nel momento in cui sentirete l'impulso irrefrenabile di impiccarvi, spararvi, tagliarvi le vene oppure ... affogarvi come  successo al presunto fondatore del movimento.     A pensarci,  proprio vero che gli opposti si toccano! Se il suicidio  la morte perfetta nel caso in cui si arriva all'apice del successo, vuol dire che non sempre chi si suicida  perch  infelice o depresso!    Per quanto riguarda altri fondamenti della dottrina, si devono odiare a morte gli psicologi ... questo  un dogma! Non  esattamente un dogma, nel senso che loro lo giustificano con il fatto che questi medici in qualche modo turlupinano i loro pazienti ... secondo me la realt  che chi si iscrive a dianetics ha necessit di avere un forte supporto, che potrebbe essere dato anche da uno psicologo ... e non da una organizzazione come quella di cui stiamo parlando.    Per quello che riguarda il test che hai fatto, quel marchingegno funziona in modo tale che basta un minimo movimento per far schizzare la freccia da una parte o l'altra del quadrante, ed  evidente che se fanno una domanda che prevede una qualche reazione, la macchina reagisce ai movimenti nervosi ed impercettibili delle mani.    Io ho assistito a dei consulti e provato il marchingegno, e ho sentito delle cose che "nessun mortale ha mai potuto ascoltare ..." ... in generale sciocchezze ....    Ad una mia amica, che  mediatemente serena, hanno detto che lei, nel suo corpo, non stava bene e doveva migliorarsi ... e questa amica, che  spiritosa, ha risposto come facesse a dire un perfetto sconosciuto che lei nel suo corpo non stava bene se molti ragazzi giudicavano che si sarebbero trovati benissimo dentro di lei ...    Il dianetico parte dal principio che ognuno di noi ha un problema (e chi non ne ha), e l'unico modo per risolvere questi problemi  andare da loro e iscriversi ai corsi.    Quando mi sono sottoposto io alla macchina, prima ho fatto muovere le lancette in modo positivo a stimoli negativi, ossia dimostrando assenza di dolore o di emozioni negative a pensieri negativi, e, contemporaneamente segnali di negativit a stimoli positivi, ossia presenza di dolore a pensieri felici e positivi, ed ho visto che gli auditor erano abbastanza in crisi a cercare giustificazioni nel responso della macchina.    Successivamente, capito come funzionava la macchina, ho fatto restare immobile la freccia sul punto di massimo equilibrio ... In teoria quello doveva essere il segnale che la persona di fronte a loro gode del massimo equilibrio e serenit, totale assenza di stress e problemi, ma questi, che comunque devono iscrivere persone alla setta, si sono sperticati nel cercare di spiegarmi che s io ero equilibrato ... ma che non era vero, perch avevo due forze negative, quindi da eliminare, quindi dovevo iscrivermi lo stesso, che si contrapponevano tra loro facendomi credere che tutto andava bene, e io dovevo combattere quelle due forze a tutti i costi, altrimenti sarei stato una persona infelice che pensava di essere felice, serena, equilibrata ...    Dimenticavo: superato il test del contatore da elettrauto, fanno poi compilare una scheda con delle domande e risposte (domande tratte da testi di psicologia). Se il test viene superato denotando una personalit forte, molto stabile e decisamente poco influenzabile, cercano di venderti solo pi una serie di testi costosi ...     Giudica te ... ma se gradisci un consiglio, se ritieni di aver bisogno di un aiuto, non ti rivolgere a nessuno di questi gruppi: studia, leggi testi, vai a fare yoga ... ma non ti avvicinare alle sette per cercare un aiuto spirituale ...|`|4121f301af60c814e1c2c553f24b2063aa	ma poi com' andato il test?|`|baed6e5da7182ff733cadb76b60a69f8aa	Non per giustificare, ma fanno cosi` ovunque.

La realt e come  e non come vogliamo che sia ! e un dato duro ma e cosi !...     una offerta vuol dire "il denaro, le cose che si offrono"    In questa societ il soldi servono per sopravivere. Senza soldi non si pu fare molto. Nessuna organizzazione pu sopravivvere senza soldi, ne anche se  senza scoppo di lucro.     Se trovasti la forma per salvare il mondo, ti servono dei soldi, e sopratutto ti serve fare conoscere la tua attivit per avere il apogio per poter andare avanti con il tuo progetto.    Scientology no  stata inventata,  stata scoperta, e fondata da L. Ron Hubbard.    Scientology  una religione nel senso pi ampio e tradizionale della parola, occupandosi di niente di meno che della piena riabilitazione dellinnata natura spirituale delluomo stesso, delle sue capacit, consapevolezza, della certezza della propria immortalit e della sua relazione con Dio.    La filosofia religiosa di Scientology contiene un sistema preciso di assiomi, leggi e tecniche, frutto di una ricerca esauriente, la cui attendibilit ed efficacia sono documentate. Su tali basi questa filosofia fornisce allindividuo la capacit di migliorare in modo incisivo non solo le proprie condizioni di vita, ma anche quelle dellambiente circostante.

f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	If you feel like you want to be a woman, and are attracted to women (but AS a woman), then there's a possibility you could be a transgendered woman who identifies as a lesbian.     There are two issues at work here: 1) Your gender identity - how you see yourself as male or female, masculine or feminine. Your gender identity sounds like it's female, so you may not be comfortable within the body you have now (male). And 2) your sexual orientation - who you're attracted to, emotionally and physically. What you're saying sounds like you like women, but as a woman, which means you could identify as a transgender lesbian - or just a lesbian in general.      My advice is to find a trans-friendly (I can't stress the 'trans-friendly' aspect enough) therapist who can help you figure this all out. Gender identity is a lot to tackle, and a therapist can help you sort everything out and help you get yourself comfortable with who you are. And, if you want to, start on a road to transitioning into who you want to be. Or, if gender identity might not be the issue here, can help you become okay with being yourself as you are.|`|2633189104d7eb9d4192d86b95d0ee41aa	sounds like you have transsexual thoughts.. so do i.  check out these websites and you can learn more about how you can truly identify who you really want to be, and how to get there..    http://tsroadmap.com  http://nikaaskini.com/  http://www.reneereyes.com/  www.urnotalone.com|`|7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	If you want to become a woman, I'd think that the first step would be to seek out a gender therapist and talk with him/her about how you feel.  You also need to understand that what you are feeling is OK -- no shame in it.  The counselor can help with this.  I don't know where in the world you are but look online or in the phone book for transgendered groups in your area...  get in contact with others like yourself -- it will make the transition so much easier.     Good luck

Ci sono anche coloro che dicono di aver ereditato questa elezione. A chiedere scusa sarebbero in molti, compresi tutti coloro che credono fermamente di essere stati chiamati, scelti, eletti (e via dicendo) da Dio. Tutti coloro che non sono come gli altri, peccatori, beoni, e infedeli.

Dio, infatti, scelse loro come "popolo eletto" per mostrare anche al resto del mondo (e a noi) la Sua presenza portandoli, all'inizio, dalla schiavit egizia alla libert e all'identit nazionale, e poi via via alla prosperit, cosa che non sarebbero mai stati in grado di raggiungere da soli.  I vari periodi di "crisi", come le deportazioni e le devastazioni, coincidono o seguono immediatamente, il periodo in cui Israele aveva un culto politeista, come affermano tutti i vari "profeti minori" dell'epoca, come Isaia, Geremia, ecc ecc...

It is a culture, custom, tradition and way of Hindus lives.  A Hindu is born to Hindus in Hindustan (India) and none can convert into Hinduism.   At the most one may adopt that culture.    Hinduism categorised humans in 4 varnas (groups) and hundreds of castes in each varna.  Those people not included therein are treated as Untouchables.  They are kept far away and restrained entry from human localities, though animals, insects, birds, reptiles are never restrained.   Hindus worship and pray doing honestly the jobs of their castes, they born in by nature.  Castes are eternal and can never be changed.    All Indian Governments' (Central & State) laws, rules, regulations, notifications, orders and judgements of High/Supreme courts confirm time and again that the castes are unchangeable.  A Hindu remains always in his caste till he embraces any religion.  Castes are by birth/nature not by the professions people opt.  Influenced by western & modern thoughts (Islam & Christianity) some misguide the innocent contrarily.  Thus there cannot be a conversion of Christians to Hinduism.  Widipedia provides thorough believeable information on this issue.|`|b03cda802a5365c4ab29bdce2799cd9daa	Don't follow gimmicks of conversion. Hinduism is a culture, not a religion. Just follow your consicence and you will find yourself close to your culture. There are no references about hinduism in veda's. They just talk about 'Sanatan Dharma' - meaning set of duties for all human beings. They never described about anything called religion.    All the best...    :-)|`|gEwRfZ1Saa	Cornbread Fred has to take a poop.|`|50054c474938470d8f949d36fbee2119aa	Conversion  Since the Hindu scriptures are essentially silent on the issue of religious conversion, the question of whether Hindus should evangelize is open to interpretation. Those who see Hinduism mainly as a philosophy, a set of beliefs, or a way of life generally believe that one can convert to Hinduism by incorporating Hindu beliefs into one's life and considering oneself a Hindu. Some view Hinduism as more of an ethnicity than a religion and believe being born a Hindu makes one a Hindu for life. These people tend to believe that there is an assumption that one is Hindu when they come from India. The Supreme Court of India has taken the former view, holding that the question of whether a person is a Hindu should be determined by the person's belief system, not by their ethnic or racial heritage.    There is no formal process for conversion to Hinduism, although in many traditions a ritual called dksh ("initiation") marks the beginning of spiritual life. Most Hindu sects do not actively recruit converts because they believe that the goals of spiritual life can be attained through any religion, as long as it is practiced sincerely. Nevertheless, Hindu "missionary" groups operate in various countries to provide spiritual guidance to persons of any religion. Examples include the Vedanta Society, Parisada Hindu Dharma, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Arya Samaj and the Self-Realization Fellowship.|`|a3f2346e607c3139333cbb9b29986604aa	I guess you just go along to a Hindu temple; you can be what you want to be.   But do you really want to change from a faith that shows you the way to forgiveness through Christ's sacrifice, in exchange for one that doesn't understand the concept of divine forgiveness.  We all need forgiveness, for we all sin.|`|x6RltI4eaa	As a Hindu we believe in GOD. So also a true Hindu will respect all religions.

38a636252c3dfa62b74a78560926dd7baa	Du grec ?, mtaphore, au sens propre, transport, c'est--dire une transposition de sens. Le procd de langage dit mtaphore relve de la linguistique et de la rhtorique. Une mtaphore est une figure de sens (trope, ou mtasmme) dans lequel un mot qui a habituellement un sens A est utilis avec un sens B. Cette substitution se fait sur la base de proprits communes aux deux termes (autrement dit, la mtaphore suppose toujours une comparaison implicite). Mais l'intrt de la mtaphore est d'attribuer au sens B les nuances qui appartiennent au terme A.    Dans la mesure o le sens des mots peut tre unique ou pluriel suivant la langue  Nous ne pouvons que transposer une mtaphore trangre par une fran?aise, le sens tant per?u comme le mme     C'est valable entre toutes les langues    La traduction littrale ne donne jamais rien de bon !!|`|DEwZDSdPaa	Je crois que les mtaphores, expressions et autres figures de style sont extrmement difficiles  traduire, d'un sens comme dans l'autre.    Ces petits tournures sont ancre dans une langue, la subtilit des mtaphores fran?aises fait appel  des notions que les trangers n'ont pas forcment.    J'entends par l que mme en traduisant correctement une expression, le sens n'est pas forcment per?u correctement, mme si la traduction est elle tout  fait correcte :)    Ca dpend beaucoup des la subtilit de la phase en question. Puis l'humour n'est pas forcment universel, il en est de mme pour la subtilit de certaines expressions :)|`|7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	Quand on apprend une langue etrangere -- desole, pas d'accents ici -- c'est bien difficile de traduire toutes des nuances, c'est-a-dire des metaphores.  Le but, a mon avis, quand on traduit d'une langue a une autre est de trouver le sens, la signification cachee si je peux dire.  On ne peut pas du tout faire une traduction litterale.  Par exemple... on francais on dit "d'autres chats a fouetter" mais en anglais, on utilise "poissons" au lieu de "chats".  Si on ne connait pas cette expression, on ne peut pas faire une traduction correcte.

He chewed tobacco and was always very dirty from working out in the fields. I was very fastidious and found it hard to be affectionate towards him.    Now I wish I could tell him how much I loved him and all the things that I treasure about his memory. He gave me a love for wordplay, a deep appreciation for the land, and a fund of common sense principles to live my life by.

97557a1ba23b06b6888ece731faa99dfaa	Please do not let others ever make you feel bad about the gift you have. It is like our 6th sense.and there will be a time in the not to distant future when everyone will wonder how we ever questioned this. Yes the human spinal column serves not only as the nerve center for controlling our body but also as an antenna... most people do not understand how to transmit and many never will be able to ...but a few gifted people can and many people receive but very few understand or are able to process the information that they are receiving. The government is doing experiments with this as I write to you. And as time is not linear but circular(this to is just now being discovered and experimented with) it is logical ..or at least it will be logical soon to consider the possibility that some few of us do infact receive information before it happens. We often do not realize this ...  sometimes people will act in a way that defies reason, they will do something as if reacting to something that they could not have known about at a given time, like reaching for a cup before it falls or like stopping at a green light just as a guy runs a red light or speeding up to go through an intersection just before there is a crash. Or leaving a party or a store just before some bad incident happens. I have written poetry for many years and in fact wrote a poem about how a building blew up on my sons birthday and some years later 9/11 occurred. I wrote about how my father passed away in the winter months like a snow man melting in the sun and then he dies the next winter unexpectedly.   I have written poems all my life and many of them have in them elements of things that eventual came to be. But to discuss this with others only opens oneself up to ridicule and laughter by so many who think they are so much more aware or educated or somehow superior to you. It is best to keep some things to yourself. Keep in mind that 99% of the world at one time thought the world was flat. And we must deal with that today as well. As for the fear you feel, do not distress yourself. Be comforted in the knowledge that in most cases you are just seeing a piece of what will come about ..and again in most cases you have no control over what will happen. None. So why worry about it. Yes tough times are coming you are not the only one seeing this...so prepare for it as best you can ...but live for today ..not tomorrow... or for yesterday. You are not getting special messages which the world depends on you to change .do not put that kind of pressure on yourself. You simply have a gift, and where you can use it wiselylike stopping at that green light....do. Enjoy the time you have for you have a lot of time left to enjoy this...this wonderful life.  Be happy!|`|12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	I was living with a boyfriend in a nearby town. I had a dream that I was renting a tiny apartment, where you entered into a small kitchen. To the left was a bathroom with pink tile, and straight through the kitchen was a living room with a mustard colored couch. A door in the living room led to a tiny bedroom. My stepfather was with me, and he said, "It sure is small Amy, there's not even room for a table." I replied "That's OK, I'm only going to be here a few weeks."    Fast forward 8 months. I discovered my boyfriend was cheating, so I left. I rented an apartment sight unseen, and while filling out the paper work my new landlord told me of a larger apt. opening in three weeks. I signed on for 3 weeks in the small one, then a year in the larger. We went to look at the small apartment. Upon entering the kitchen there was a door to the left that opened onto a bathroom with pink tile. Straight through the kitchen was a tiny livingroom with a mustard colored couch. Off the livingroom was a tiny bedroom.    On my way home to get my belongings, my stepfather, who was driving me because I don't, said, "It sure is small Amy. There's not even room for a table." I replied "That's OK, I'm only going to be there 3 weeks."

No one can "see" the future, whether dreaming or looking in a crystal ball!    It's easy to prove.  Start writing down ALL of your dreams BEFORE you think they have come true.  You will find that NONE of them do.  When you think you are recalling a dream (this always happens after the fact), it is simply your brain processing information in a delayed manner, making you think you have "dreamed" it before.  The answer with the apartment, notice she only remembered the dream and told someone about it AFTER the event happened.  The account would only be credible if she had told someone the dream BEFORE it happened.|`|98f0314f07275edc510275e3fc07f31daa	While pregnant with my 4th child I had a dream that my water broke.

I woke up puzzled by the dream.  Two weeks later my water broke,  I was in my 26th week of pregnancy.  The Dr.'s said the baby would arrive within 24 hours.  I laid there waiting....and then was admitted to a room.  I was there for FIVE WEEKS.  (my baby was born at 31 weeks and was totally healthy).     On my 3rd day I remembered the dream.

I was talking to someone in my van and someone in the back, just about ready to leave.  And the garbage or recycle truck started backing up into me on purpose.  I put the van in reverse and looked behind my shoulder and saw trees behind the T in the road.  But the truck kept smashing into me. I started backing up and I thought.  Am I OK with God?  Then I started to pray, And thought.  I could die.  It could happen.  Then the truck hit me hard and I died.  I woke up from the dream & asked God about it.    Later understood the dream.  I had wondered the night before if I truly loved God the way I was suppose to.  The Pastor preached how to test if one loves God saying it is easy (the Sunday after my dream).  Do you obey Jesus?  Well I thought I did, but then remembered that the Lord told me to read my bible 1st thing in the Morning and I had been too tired to do so at the time.    So, it was a discipline dream.  I needed to be in touch with God right then more so, and to follow Gods direction throughout the day.  Coincidently, another Christian lady had got in a wreck with a garbage truck & she died and the person with her died.  Her baby in the back seat died later in the hospital.  Her husband and dad was on the news. Her wreck was about the same time as my dream.    My guess is that she didn't listen to Gods direction either & did die.      Another dream was back in time, my husband & I were driving in his old beater wagon, and someone had stolen our present vehicle keys.  We searched our home town territory and the drawers of the person we thought had our keys.  I woke up & asked God if this meant anything?  Understanding that a spirit of my husbands past wanted my husbands things.  Wanted to take his keys to our vehicles and wanted me too.    Well I told my husband and prayed protection.  Well my husband went back to drunkedness and got into pornography on the computer after having quit drinking for a while.  It was the worst weekend of our married life that I could remember. But I had to pray against the alcoholic spirit and pornography spirit.  It was a horrible spiritual battle.  But the dream warned me of what was happening and after the horrible incidents that followed, I know that it helped me get through that difficult time.  Actually I had a breakthrough shortly afterward when I prayed with others about it & for my husbands salvation.|`|a63a9b04f1e6754346279583f57a4c71aa	of course!

The three different persons of God (God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit) have slightly different roles. Jesus was the one who became a man and lived on earth for a while and died as a punishment for our sin so we don't have to be punished. The Holy Spirit is the person who lives inside Christians, pointing out where we're messing up and helping us to become what God wants them to be.

I'd like to inform you that the Gospel and Torah have been misrepresented by Jews themselves, and hid the real meaning of the matter that you suffer from it.    The fact is that - as Quran says-   (It id He Who (Allah) has sent sent down the Book (Quran) to you (Muhammed, you saw) with truth confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) ).    (And (remember)when the angels said: "O, Maryam "Mary"! Verily, Allah has chosen you,purified you,(from polytheism and disbelief) and chosen you above the women of Alamin (mankind) (of her lifetime ).   (When the angels said: O, Maryam "Mary"! Verily, Allah gives you the glad tidings of a word "Be"-and he was!  His name will be the Messiah ibn Maryam held in honor in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah.) (She (Mary)said:"O, my Lord!How shall I have a son when no man has touched me. He said:"So it will be for Allah creats what wills. When He has decreed something He says to it only "Be" and it is.) (And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel)(And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel, (saying): Lo! I come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah's leave. And I announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses. Lo! herein verily is a portent for you, if ye are to be believers.) ("'(I have come to you), to attest the Law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was (Before) forbidden to you; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me) ("'It is Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a Way that is straight.'" (But when Isa perceived unbelief on their part, he said Who will be my helpers in Allah's way? The disciples said: We are helpers (in the way) of Allah: We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are submitting ones.) (Our Lord! We believe in that which Thou hast revealed and we follow him whom Thou hast sent. Enrol us among those who witness (to the truth). (And (the unbelievers) plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and the best of planners is Allah.)(Behold! Allah said: "O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.)(As for those who disbelieve I shall chastise them with a heavy chastisement in the world and the Hereafter; and they will have no helpers. )("As to those who believe and work righteousness, Allah will pay them (in full) their reward; but Allah loveth not those who do wrong." )("This is what we rehearse unto thee of the Signs and the Message of Wisdom." )(Surely the likeness of Isa is with Allah as the likeness of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, Be, and he was.)(This is) the truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad), so be not thou of those who waver.) (If any one disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full) knowledge Hath come to thee, say: "Come! let us gather together,- our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: Then let us earnestly pray, and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!") (This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise.) (But if they turn back, then surely Allah knows the mischief-makers.)

Jehovah is the Father and Jesus Christ is the son. when Jesus was here on earth, he prayed to his Father Jehovah in the heaven. Jesus said he cannot do anything without the Father in the Heaven. Jesus Christ never said he was God Almighty. he said he was the son of the Most Holy Father. yes he said you seen me you seen the Father, he was with Jehovah God from the very beginning so he knows his Father real well. the 12 he was with said he was the son of Jehovah God, not God himself. no one has seen Jehovah, not even Moses, but they seen Jesus Christ when he was born to a virgin mother Mary when she was an adult and to his stepfather Joseph. Jesus Christ was the first creation that Jehovah God made, so Jesus is not God.

[005:072] Surely, they have disbelieved who say: "God is the Messiah Jesus, son of Mary." But the Messiah Jesus said: "O Children of Israel! Worship God, my Lord and your Lord." Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with God, then God has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalim?n (polytheists and wrong doers) there are no helpers.     [005:073] Surely, disbelievers are those who said: "God is the third of the three (in a Trinity)." But there is no god (none who has the right to be worshipped) but God alone. And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them.     [005:074] Will they not turn with repentance to God and ask His forgiveness? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.     [005:075] The Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Mary] was a Sidd?qah [i.e. she believed in the Words of God and His Books (see Verse 66:12)]. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while God does not eat). Look how We make the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them; yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth).

He is the one God, Who has no partner.  2. Nothing is like Him. He is the Creator, not created, nor a part of His creation.  3. He is All-Powerful, absolutely Just.  4. There is no other entity in the entire universe worthy of worship besides Him.  5. He is First, Last, and Everlasting; He was when nothing was, and will be when nothing else remains.  6. He is the All-Knowing, and All-Merciful,the Supreme, the Sovereign.  7. It is only He Who is capable of granting life to anything.  8. He sent His Messengers (peace be upon them) to guide all of mankind.  9. He sent Muhammad (pbuh) as the last Prophet and Messenger for all mankind.  10. His book is the Holy Qur'an, the only authentic revealed book in the world that has been kept without change.  11. Allah knows what is in our hearts.      Almighty God is Compassionate, Loving and Merciful. The essence of falsehood is the claim that God cannot deal with and forgive His creatures directly. By over-emphasizing the burden of sin, as well as claiming that God cannot forgive you directly, false religions seek to get people to despair of the Mercy of God. Once they are convinced that they cannot approach God directly, people can be mislead into turning to false gods for help. These "false gods" can take various forms, such as saints, angels, or someone who is believed to be the "Son of God" or "God Incarnate".       The original, unchanged revelations given to Abraham and other prophets(like Moses and Jesus ) reaching back to Adam all came from the One True God(The Creator). This common origin explains their similarities in many beliefs and values       However, over time the teachings of the various religions, due to a variety of reasons, have become distorted and mixed with made-man ideas.       The last Prophet and Messenger of God, Muhammad , who is a direct descendant of Abraham through his first born son, Ishmael, was sent with the Last Guidance, Revelation and Testament, the Holy Qur'an(koran) to amend and correct the changes and corruption made to the the "Torah" which was sent to Moses and theTrue Gospel of Jesus.To say the truth ,God preserved all the other Holy Books plainly by preserving His Last Book the Holy Qur'an(koran)which contains the right and the truth of all that was changed in those other Books.       This is why this last Revelation which was sent 1423 years ago has remained unchanged, not even a word or a letter has been altered.       There is not even one word of difference between two Arabic Qur'ans, anywhere in the world. There has been no disagreements in history among Muslims as to what should and should not be in the Qur'an. However, in the case of the Bible, even the most ancient manuscripts conflict with one another so that no two are identical. Footnotes in all modern versions of the Bible prove this fact.       These revisions serve as concrete proofs that all the Biblical books are not at all divinely inspired. This is because it is beyond man's ability to correct the work of his Creator, who alone is Almighty and perfect         It was only natural for Almighty God to preserve the scripture revealed to Prophet Muhammad, because he was the last Prophet and Final Messenger of God.       Islam teaches us that we must pray directly to God without an intermediary and no soul can bear the burden of another and that the nature of humanity is good, and we did not inherit sin from Adam. Each soul comes into being free of sin.in Islam there are no priests or clergy -- each worshipper, man or woman, has a direct relationship with their Merciful Creator -- Almighty God. Since God is the Owner and Sustainer of everything, as well as the only one who can provide true and complete forgiveness, it is completely futile to try to approach Him through anyone else.       The oneness and universality of God's message requires that people accept all the messengers of God. Rejecting one of them amounts to rejecting them all. The Jews reject Jesus's mission and Muhammad's mission; the Christians reject Muhammad's mission; whereas the Muslims accept them all, but reject incorrect historical interpretations and human elements in these missions.       As the Qur'an is the final revelation and Muhammad is the final prophet, humanity is obligated to accept it: "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost all spiritual good" (3:86).       The Final Prophet Muhammad said: "Whoever believes there is no god but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is messenger of God, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven."       you can do that now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce the two confirmations and attestations of faith, here it is           I BEAR WITNESS THAT THERE IS NO GOD WORTHY OF WORSHIP EXCEPT ALLAH ( ARABIC WORD MEANS ONE GOD-THE CREATOR). AND I BEAR WITNESS THAT MUHAMMAD IS HIS SERVANT AND MESSENGER. I BEAR WITNESS THAT JESUS IS HIS SERVANT AND MESSENGER.         The right picture of lslam is conveyed in the Qur'an, which is exemplified by Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. The reality is that it is not fair to judge a religion by the actions of its followers alone because there are good and bad followers in every religion. The correct thing to do is to judge a religion by its documented revelation from God and the prophet who brought that revelation.     I encourage Christians and other religions to learn about Islam from Muslim sources and The Basis Of The Muslim Belief and not rely on second hand information which in many cases is distorted or contains a deep seated anti Muslim agenda. This is indeed a more|`|c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	The bible calls both Jesus and the Devil as a God.   2Cor. 4:4  The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers    Of course the Devil is not the creator and neither is Jesus.    The Hebrews separated the creators name from his sons own name making it easier for us to know the difference between them.    Creator = Yahweh in Hebrew, Iehova/Jehovah in English  Creators Son = Yeshua in Hebrew, Jesus in English    Before anything existed, our planet earth, our universe, even the sprit world called the heavens, there was only the creator. His first action was to create a son (Yeshua/Jesus) and between the two of them created everything else.    Colossians 1:15 - He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.

Cultural differences can also lead to differences in interpretation as well, which could look like dishonesty when two people describe the same event in very different terms.

Estos maravillosos astrnomos que establecieron en su poca la rotacin completa de la Tierra alrededor del Sol en 365,2420 das (la NASA la mide hoy en 365,2422) y que establecieron que la rotacin de nuestro sistema solar alrededor de la galaxia dura 25.000 a?os, anticiparon acontecimientos para nuestra poca que lentamente se van cumpliendo y que significan cambios tanto en los social, poltico y climtico que acompa?arn grandes trasformaciones en el interior del alma humana.     Los mayas sostenan que desde el centro de la galaxia Hunab Ku, cada 5.125 a?os, surge un rayo poderossimo, que sincroniza al Sol y a todos sus planetas con una poderosa emanacin de energa. Dividan la rotacin del sistema solar alrededor de la galaxia en dos fracciones de 12.812 a?os cada una, llamando Da a la ms cercana al centro galctico y Noche a la ms lejana. A su vez, la elipse era dividida en cinco perodos de 5.125 a?os que representaban la ma?ana, el medioda, la tarde, el atardecer y la noche. De acuerdo a los Mayas, en el nuevo milenio estamos ingresando en la ma?ana galctica, recibiendo el rayo sincronizador desde Hunab Ku. Estas emanaciones de energa provenientes del centro de la galaxia fueron ya descriptas por la NASA en 1998.     Para los mayas la fecha final de este proceso, es el sbado 22 de diciembre del a?o 2012, cuando termina el "Tiempo del No-Tiempo".      suerte!!|`|0cdac470bbaa40ab9818ed5d418bf850aa	Creo que te refieres al fin del mundo, si es as , te lo digo que no es el fin del mundo, sino en 2014.

Los libros sagrados tratan de explicarnos cmo es Dios, cmo nos ha amado y que Todos somos hermanos. Dios no tiene nombre ni religin porque nadie ha estado antes que El y porque no las necesita. El hombre es quien le ha puesto muchos nombres y hasta le ha puesto un sexo (Padre), pero acaso no se parece ms Dios a una madre que aun padre? Dios no tiene sexo.    Los libros sagrados no fueron editados por Dios o no fueron impresos en el mismo cielo, por tanto incluyen mucha basura que el hombre al tratar de traducir de lenguas muertas (de manera conciente o inconciente) desvirta sus conceptos originales, de tal manera que pretender regir nuestra vida en base a un libro sagrado no es correcto porque corremos el riesgo de caer en el fanatismo y hasta en matarnos a nosotros mismos o a otros creyendo que as agradamos a Dios cuando es todo lo contrario.    Yo nunca creer en una religin que :  1) Impida el desarrollo de las civilizaciones.  2) Agreda a las instituciones y poderes pblicos  3) Incite a guerras santas o promueva inquisiciones  4) Quite la libertad de pensamiento a las gentes  5) Amenace con infiernos, castigos y falsas culpas  6) Se adue?e de la voluntad de las personas  7) Haga infelices a sus seguidores  8) No sea tolerante con otras religiones  9) Diga que es la nica y verdadera y las dems falsas  10) Que pongan sus principios, sus credos, sus libros sagrados y sus sacerdotes o pastores o jeques o como se les llame por encima de DIOS.

EsrkBnitaa	I wouldn't recommend it.  I tried to use the Farsi version, but returned it...  They claim it's "immersion," but having no explanations and no structure (no quizes, no dictionary, no search function), makes it really hard to learn with.  Especially when you forget how to say one thing (you can't look anything up) it becomes pretty frustrating.    If you're looking for a great program and willing to spend a little money, I'd go with the Pimsleur method.  I've used it for Japanese and Farsi, and it works great.|`|361c160131c0b875230e72e3748f4b89aa	It is an excellent system!

I was able to pick up words and phrases relatively easily.  So, yea, I'd recommend it if you were serious about learning a foreign language|`|ijZlpzyzaa	I have never used the Rosetta Stone software but I have tried some of the other programs and I have found that some of the FSI programs work better.  The difference in these programs and the Pimsleur is the Pimsleur is totally audio with no book.  So you might be able to speak some but definately won't be able to read or write it, not to mention Pimsleur is about the most expensive program you can buy.  You can order the Barron's Mastering Spanish for around $50 per level through amazon.  Both FSI Programmatic Spanish (Remastered) and Barron's' Mastering Spanish were developed by the Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State. And,in my opinion, the FSI method is one of the most effective ways to learn Spanish. But it certainly is not one of the most fun ways to learn Spanish. If you are looking for a solid approach to learning Spanish, I highly recommend the FSI course. It will require you to read a textbook. So if reading a textbook while you are learning Spanish is something you don't have time for, then look elsewhere for a Spanish course.     Now I will quickly attempt to compare FSI Programmatic Spanish (Remastered) and Barron's' Mastering Spanish.  Both courses use native Speakers which is a big plus.     Baron's' calls its teaching method the Guided Imitation method. The Guided Imitation method is built upon two premises. One is that one of the most effective models to learning Spanish requires the student to study a small body of material until the material is thoroughly mastered. And the second is that language mastery depends on effectively manipulating the sounds, sequences, and patterns of a language until the learner sounds authentic. In Baron's', each Unit in the course starts with a basic dialog that's a re-creation of a real situation that the student is likely to encounter in "Surlandia." Surlandia is a mythical country in Latin America.     In FSI Programmatic Spanish (Remastered) a typical unit covers a cycle of work that requires about 3 to 5 hours of study for the average to above-average learner. The learning that takes place during a typical unit is sequenced as follows:     1. OBSERVATION of the language.   2. PRACTICE with what has been learned.   3. VARIATION of what has been practiced.   4. APPLICATION of what has been taught in the first three stages.     According to one of the authors of FSI Programmatic Spanish, the principal difference in approach between FSI Spanish Basic (Barron's' Mastering Spanish) and FSI Programmatic Spanish is that the latter was intended to be supplemented with classroom instruction. FSI Programmatic Spanish includes an instructor's manual for those that do not have a classroom instructor or those who wish to rely entirely on self-study.     Oddly, you get the complete Barrons Mastering Spanish 3 and 4 audio courses (i.e. FSI Spanish 3 and 4) as bonus downloads when you order FSI Programmatic 1 or 2 at Amazon.     I would be doing everyone a disservice if I recommended one course over the other. Since the material covered in the two courses do not overlap and both courses are relatively inexpensive compared to many popular Spanish courses, I encourage you to buy both courses.     But however, keep in mind if you are not really dedicated to learning Spanish these types of programs are not for you.  Also I recommend buying a vocabulary workbook which can find on Amazon to help build your vocabulary.   I don't know if you know any spanish at all, but if your boyfriend speaks spanish you should really try to practice with him.  When he says something in spanish that you don't understand, make him show you what it is and then repeat the phrase.  I found that learning in sentences works better rather than just learning lists of words.  There is also an easy phrase book available at Amazon that has some pretty basic phrases that might help you.  And your boyfriend can help you with the pronounciation.    However, keep in mind that what these programs teach you is not slang spanish.  You will have to learn that from your boyfriend.  And it is necessary that you learn the slang or it is very difficult to understand what is being said.  Believe me I know my boyfriend also speaks spanish.     I hope this information will be valuable to you

0d04fed4c94db9f1cd359c2632488272aa	Most black parents don't do anything for their kids they just use them for a paycheck from the government.It's the white parents that still support their children and their children after they have grown.|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	it is not your business.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	It has nothing to do with race, a lot of young girls are getting pregnant in their teens and early twenties. They usually are still in school or just not financially able to take care their kids, so the parents end up taking care of the kids. This is something that happens in a lot of poor families but not all. Not all Black women get pregnant early or have the parents taking care of their kids. I'm 21 I have no kids, and I'm not planning on having any kids anytime soon.|`|e98866b085ffa2485ad7691411d0206caa	I am not sure, unless they are unable to do so, like being incarcerated or ill.    I guess this is a great question, however, I know of plenty of white people who have children and their parents are taking care of them. Look at all the orphans of the 911 attacks, or of all the fallen soldiers killed in Iraq.... hmmmm    I think it is great that a grandparent is able to step in and take care of their grandchildren instead of sending them to foster care.     Good question|`|54c94e598a6ae497084c240208a1a43faa	I have seen this with other culture too..Latino"s, Filipino's they have a way of making poor old grandma and grandpa do what they should be doing.  Thank God my German American parents raised us not to take advantage of our elders.  This shameful way of living is an indictment on the whole culture not just blacks (although they are very guilty of this stinking thinking) but people of all races.|`|7e45ea9e2cad770cb7a1dd48907df0a9aa	Generalizing. All races do. It could be a millions of reasons why like kids being abuse, drugs, incest etc. Unfortunately this happen in all races not just African Americans. In these cases most of the time the grandparent get custody of the kids. The media wants you to believe in the lie that it's only in the black community but it's not.  If black grandparents are taking care of their grandchildren. Why do you care?  It's none of your business.  Are you paying their bills? No. I think it good they do then these kids won't go into foster care. Good and bad things happen to all races. Not one race is good and not one race is bad. Common sense should let you know this all ready.  Why don't you ask a black person face to face it you are so curious?  Instead of hiding behind a computer. Get out and talk to people of different races and cultures and find out the truth for yourself.|`|7euKjvG9aa	Why should you care? As long as you're not taking care of these children I don't understand why its your concern. In black families often its the grandmother who is the head of the family, as it is within mine. My grandma, who is my daughter's great grandma, is head over our family. She didn't raise all of her 19 grandchildren, but all of us at some point lived with her. The same as it is with my mother, she takes over when it comes to my daughter. Its really a strange thing to explain to someone that more than likely didn't grow up in a large family.   Then there are the kids that only have their grandparents because their parents are in jail of they were taken by the state. There are children of every race that are in this predicament, but usually white kids that are taken away from their parents are living in foster care, the grandparents are too into themselves to raise their own blood relations.|`|3d4a674674c4fab60cbf13db879fb019aa	Generalizations are never productive|`|hSxcjlZdaa	Where do you get this from?|`|5b45e0c28330a0801c462e34966da9acaa	Where'd you get a name like Dink?

I see way more white girls/white parents in this situation  although many times the baby is bi-racial.|`|14IQJgJ9aa	First off this subject is not just applied to the black race there are grandparents of all races taking care of their grandchildren and the reason maybe just cause they want to or they are trying to give their children a chance to become better people or maybe its their way of keeping the children with the family and out of the system and from having foster parents. Whatever the circumstance it happens in all races and their actions are based on love and its a blessing to know that their are people who truly care enough to take on such a huge responsibility. You should learn from their actions of love and not be so ignorant and racist. Love everyone. Hate noone.

Good luck if you want to learn.|`|3b8f805c7988647b5a9ca864a23d2a7aaa	Let me give you a taste of what you're in for...    An excerp from 'Esperanto: A Language for the Global Village' by Sylvan Zaft. This guy knows his French quite well.    The French verbs are so complicated that publishers put out useful books like Christopher Kendriss Dictionary of 501 French Verbs Fully Conjugated in All the Tenses. Kendris devotes one full page to each verb.     The verb parler means to speak, to talk. Here are some of the forms it takes:    Tense............................ (for first through third persons singular and first through third persons plural)    present indicative.........parle, parles, parle, parlons, parler, parlent    imperfect indicative......parlais, parlais, parlait, parlions, parliez, parlaient    simple past..................parlai, parlas, parla, parlames, parlates, parlrent    future........................... parleras, parlera, parlerons, parlerez, parleront    conditional...................... parlerais, parlerait, parlerions, parleriez, parleraient    present subjunctive......parle, parles, parle, parlions, parliez, parlent    imperfect subjunctive...parlasse, parlasses, parlat, parlassions, parlassiez, parlassent    Imperative....................... person singular: parle; first and second persons plural: parlons, parlez    This chart shows a few dozen different forms of parler. Sometimes the same form has a few different uses. For instance parle is used for the first and third persons singular of the present indicative as well as the first and third persons singular of the present subjunctive as well as the second person singular of the imperative.    Some of these forms are rarely used and are mainly found in earlier literature. In addition to these listed forms, there are a number of compound forms, using the auxiliary verb avoir. Many of these are very common.    ------------------------------...  End of excerpt.    So, if you're up for that then go for it buddy.  Good luck|`|c83411c47082cd6a2395f7e0b9534fa5aa	It'll ask you an effort but just like any other language.  On the other hand, being able to speak another language makes you feel good and enlarges considerably your intellectual horizon.  French could give you much satisfaction.    Ne te dcourage pas !

26896be25b9fe83bcef7859a07b98f01aa	I often wonder the same thing.  The other thing I wonder is what some of these people expect the non-extremist Muslims to do about it?

He was asked at the 9/11 site a few days after the incident, "What do you think about your co-religionists involvement in this grave crime against humanity"? Muhammed Ali shot back "What do YOU think about your co-religionist (Hitler) wiping out half of the jews from the face of this earth in the biggest ethnic cleansing ever witnessed by human kind? Are you ashamed of yourself & your religion?" Needless to say, the questioner simply disappeared from the scene.  Secondly, the single Muslim who shouts Allah O Akbar isn't stupid. He has every right to shout it. If you don't consider him speaking for you, that can't make him stupid !! You need not be ashamed or behave as if you are ashamed of your religious identity or any other aspect of your religion just because "Big Brother Is Watching You" !!|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	You inherit the worst of the questions about your faith because there are some Muslims that want our country, and or end our lives. They are fanatics that only see their way, and their way isn't interested in whatever we believe other than we are to be outlawed as Christians are in the countries that they control. They want to put Christians to death by Shirah Law.    So the faith that you carry is currently the imposing force that would take things from us. It's not your fault, but it is the current event issue. People used to talk bad about Germany during WWII. And about Japan at the time as well. Now it's your turn. Only instead of a nation, it's a religion-- attributed to being yours.    I would recommend a Muslim task force to politically uproot current Muslim government, or change them into something less-- whiny. They are always saying how bad Israel is. And yet Israel isn't the one blowing themselves up at military gates and cafes.    Just face it, your religion is CURRENTLY filled with religious nutcases that are CURRENTLY destroying any credibility that Muslims might otherwise have. Resonable, intelligent, peaceful people that are religious, do not strap on bombs and attempt to cause terror. I'm sure you wont do that, but you are a part of a religion where it is common enough to know that many Muslims do.     It's not so hard to understand. Islam is the current enemy of anyone who wants freedom. Islam sees no separation of state from the religious bodies-- completely ignoring the examples of the bloody past of the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, where many people suffered death because they did not comply to the 'government recognized' religion.    So not only do we have an example of Muslim's murdering people for the sake of terror, but we also have the seeming greater reason to resist and impune because nearly all Muslims want any government to comply to Shirah Law.    Anyone knowing the history of the world to an extent of government's religious conformity knows that it is a mistake, no matter what rhetoric and goal is envisioned, for a religion to control the Laws of a country. It is not a peaceful thing.

yMnzg6HVaa	Well, this is self-explanatory. No muslim can be an anti-muslim. That would be a fallacy. I can either be a muslim or a non-muslim. Not both together. I can either except Allah (SWT) as the creator, the one & only, or reject him. I can't do both at the same time. What the paragraphs above are doing amounts to just that.     While trying to convince others that the words are being spoken by a practising & proud muslim, what they convey are really anti-islamic utterances cloaked in the unity & brotherhood doctrine to hide the anti-islamic bias.     If muslims need to be more open, then so do others. Jews cannot tolerate any questioning of the holocaust. Hindus have destroyed mosques, tried to kill M.F. Hussain & many other artists for their art & killed innocent people like Graham Staines & his two minor kids just for preaching christianity. Christians cant tolerate Al-Jazeera TV channel because it speaks & shows the truth which reflects poorly on their cruel practises of subjugating the poor & the downtrodden under various pretexts.    All the above points should in reality be followed by hindus, christians, budhists, sikhs etc. because they follow man-made laws which are not perfect. Muslims follow the divine Shariah which is not only perfect but also the only solution to all evils of this world. If instead of muslims not following shariah, hindus & christians start following shariah, the world will be a much much better place to live in.    Finally, when you say not all muslims think this way, do you know who a muslim is, in the first place? Not Ayaan Hirsi Ali, definitely not Tasleema Nasreen & ofcourse neither your favorite darling, Salman Rushdie!! A muslim is a person who has accepted Islam as his religion & has submitted his will to Allah & has decided to do & support what is right & reject & oppose what is wrong always. A muslim is a person who will live his life according to the rules established by the creator, pray, pay his zakath on time in the right proportion to the poor and the needy,  earn only what is legal, never take undue advantage of the poor,  the distressed & the needy, for whom alcohol is haraam or forbidden, one who will not have sex outside marriage & who will serve his parents in their old age, apart from many other requirements. And Allah (swt) will judge people on the basis of these do's and don'ts (Shariah) & not on the basis of secularism or democracy.     So, O muslims of the world, reject the Shariah at your own risk!!|`|d82fcb6de9ce28d93513b91d4bdf93b2aa	Sounds good to me.     Of course the Christians could learn a lesson from this as well.|`|ddd28f8c887b82b2b04a291bbb727606aa	You are so typical. I think it's your ego more than anything else. Anyway, so you won't dismiss this as just name-calling. Muslims, as a whole, are far from practicing Islam. By the way, there is no such thing as a secular Muslim. Perhaps you didn't see that Al-Jazeera debate where Wafaa got shown up by that guy, I can send you the entire dialogue.|`|4370bf590398e3d7c997a8c36874c7c3aa	The majority of Muslims share these views. You only hear about the extremist ones because they're the ones who speak up and make noise, and are good fodder for the media.    Moderates in every religion tend to keep quiet, because religion is not the number one priority in their lives.|`|35cd78158e164157d810e7b52896914baa	You might be surprised that are more Muslims like this.|`|9bc3b8b015bb1bb259223ca63a68d555aa	"We affirm the inviolable freedom of the individual conscience. We believe in the equality of all human persons."    Ok, so Islam is filled with human, animal and even plants rights, But there's no place for secularism, Islam is not just a religion, it's a comprehensive and extent ideology and way of life.

Keep on praying, and walk with the Lord moment by moment.  ...I would not start any proceedings against him - if there is a divorce, do not have it originate from you.  ...I hope and pray that your husband returns to you, because divorce is never God's desire and was not His design.     ...He says in Malachi 2:16   ..."For I hate divorce," says the LORD, the God of Israel..."  ...Whether or not your husband returns, I firmly believe that the Lord is really the only one who can meet our deepest needs in life.  ...May the Lord give you much grace and wisdom as you walk with him.

That's your mind talking to ya, dear.|`|yMnzg6HVaa	I can answer you from an Islamic point of view.     We must give up the idea of a God who is similar to a deity, sitting up there in the skies, distributing wealth and resources, as and when the devotees appeal. This idea, which is very real, comes from various religions where different deities are assigned different functions. So, to take an example, there is a deity for bestowing children. If nothing works, then you offer a sacrifice to this deity, and you will be granted a baby sooner or later. To confirm the belief of thousands, it is enough if one in a hundred gets a baby after the sacrifice and services. The news spreads far and wide  i.e., of the grant by the deity  and the crowds at the deity grow thick. Or, if somebodys business is not doing well, then, all he has to do is to go to another deity, make offerings, and, by the time you come back, (apply for fresh bank loans), and the business is on the right track. The deity gets the credit.     Islam requires us to submit ourselves to Allah, unconditionally: whether He gives or denies. You work lifelong to win His approval. When you experience ease, you thank Him, and when unease, you bear it with patience. You do not expect Him to find a job for you. But rather, you study, and study hard, pass out with good grades, then you send across applications, and hunt for a job yourself. Finally, when you find one, after a great struggle, you thank Allah for having got you a job.  There is no way in Islam for someone to pray in a manner in which his wishes can be fulfilled, and quickly. Far from anything happening quickly, there is no guarantee anything will happen at all by way of fulfillment of wishes. Wishes will be granted in Paradise. Here, in this life, you put up efforts and wait for the results. If good, then good; if bad, then also good. All is from Allah. He does what He wills. There is no way of coaxing Him into doing what the humans will, and that too at a quick pace.  We have been asked to ask Him, and none else. But He has not promised to grant all that we ask, or even one of our wishes. Even Prophets were granted a mere single wish to be fulfilled in this world. (Our Prophet reserved his own for the Next World).   Then, why do we ask? Well, we ask Him by way of worship and devotion to Him. We ask to demonstrate our belief in none but Him. We ask Him regardless of grants. Why? To show that we are truly devoted to Him, and are not doing business with Him: in a kind of give and take deal. Of course, He does grant, and does give. Did you have a meal today? Who gave it to you? Did you smile during the day? Who gave you that smile? Are you able to read these lines? Who granted the power of sight? It is Allah, the Bestower. Did you escape a stroke today? You did. Who saw to it? It is Allah. Did you end up in a hospital having eaten the food you did, the water you drank the air you breathed in? No, you did not. By whose intervention? Allahs.  He says, Ask Me, I will grant. What does it mean? It means ask none else. What about when you ask a false god? He still grants, such a Bestower is He. He grants, but hates him who asks other than Him.   Allah is not a bank manager, issuing cash against checks that arrive. He is the Lord of the universe. He feeds him who believes in Him and is devoted to Him, as well as him who disbelieves in Him and worships false gods. So, when He says, Ask Me, I will grant, then, it means, Ask not any other. It does not mean If you asked not, you will not get. Nor does it mean, You ask Me, and the thing will be right there for you to pick up on your way back home. But rather, when He says, I will grant then it means He will grant in a way that suits His wisdom.   A man may ask a raise in his income so that he can buy a motor cycle to reach office in quick time. Allah grants him barakah in his time. He asks for a raise in salary to meet the cost of travel to a distant job. Allah grants him by getting notice of termination issued to him. The next job is near his residence. A man asks Him a raise in income so that he can meet with the cost of transport to the job site. Allah puts it in the heart of the landowner to demand vacation of his house. He rents another house. It is next to job-site. A man asks for raise in income to meet with the expenses of his travel to his job. Allah saves Him from an accident that was to happen. The amount gets adjusted. A man asks for a raise so that he might spend more in Allahs cause. Allah responds by granting him a higher level of Paradise in the Hereafter, withholding it in this world because He knows that if given a raise, the man will go after the unlawful. You see, there are thousands of ways in which Allah grants in response to Prayers addressed to Him.   The bank Manager issues cash against check. The man puts it in share market. It crashes. He buys real estate. The market collapses. He puts in business. He suffers losses. He spends it on a farm, the rains fail. The bank Manager issues cash. He does not grant anything. Allah is not a bank Manager. He is the Lord of the world. He sustains it, and grants everyone in measures that He deems fit. He raises the scales, and lowers them, following His scheme and Grand Plan. Our job  as His powerless slaves  is to do our bit and then wait with patience. He will decide how He will grant. We remain thankful and forbearing in all circumstances, in all situations. Whatever comes is from Him. And whatever comes is good.

9dtzHIrhaa	While it's normal for heterosexual men to develop fetishes like this, even anal, you might teasingly ask him during foreplay when did he start liking anal play so much, etc. Make it so you are coaxing him in sexually while asking the question - if he continues and slides into everything suavely answering such then I don't think you have anything to worry about. If he stops suddenly and sort of freaks but then tries to cover his tracks, he may think you suspect him of having a 'gay thing', and he's afraid of you finding out.

AA12383960	It had it's initial fulfillment with the nation of Israel. These men in Jerusalem broke God's covenant to worship only him and were complacent.  They considered themselves safe in their materialistic trust in secular power.  They received judgment when Babylon destroyed Jerusalem.    There is also fulfillment for out day.  Today there is another warning message that is going out. However, most people also  tend to be complacent, not really serving God and paying no attention to his Word or the warning of the nearness of the great tribulation.'  Many even claim there is no God...|`|ea7d2f78db4adf1fb57e182c2fe72f6daa	well, in verse 16 he speaks of the dispersion of the jewish people.

AA12370816	Origin of the Word   "Europe"                  Western Civilization is the product of Western Man, however, Western history has within it, some major influences produced by alien cultures that have changed the course of Western history.  It is essential that Western Man identify himself historically, apart from those alien influences, if he is to preserve the future of the Western Culture.  The title "Western Man" is, in the truest sense, interchangeable with the title "European."  Why is "Western Man" called "Western Man" and why is that name interchangeable with "European?"  If Western Man is to identify himself, he must first identify the origin of his own name: "European."                This search for the definition and origin of the word "Europe" will take you from the dictionary to the encyclopedia, to Greek mythology, and then to an ancient Assyrian monument. This search for the origin of the word "Europe" is inimically connected to the people of Europe.  The dictionary simply defines Europe as a continent between Asia and the Atlantic, information that hardly satisfies our etymological needs.  The encyclopedia simply provides a geopolitical breakdown of the continent without a clue as to the origin of its name.   The name has been shrouded in mystery and archeology.                The ancient application of the word "Europe" has actually changed little, if at all, compared to how it is perceived in America today.  What implication comes to mind with the modern term "European-American," or for that matter, African-American or Asian American?  There is an automatic racial connotation that was already in your mind. This political aspect of our word-study reveals a facet of historical knowledge called racial history, a history that is presently avoided, omitted, or denied by the mainstream educational media.  Truth should never be sacrificed for the sake of political correctness because all too often, political correctness has its own self-serving social agenda.                The earliest mention of the word "Europe" as being a land mass is in Homer's poem Hymn to Apollo. However, it was not described as the continent that we now call Europe; it only referred to certain islands in the Aegean Sea.  Homer's time frame for using this word "Europe" as a land area was around the eighth century B.C.  Homer chose the name "Europe" from the Greek myth concerning "Europa." Europa is the Greek pronunciation of Europe.  The Europa myth is a story, a personification, which partly reveals the origin of the Europeans.  It becomes impossible to separate the origin of the word "Europe" from the origin of the "Europeans."   Myths are in no way to be considered as religious truths, however certain myths contain historical perspectives as viewed by the intelligent, albeit spiritually void, writers of that age.                The myth of Europa is a story of the origin of the Greek civilization.  It is the story of a racial and cultural migration wrapped within the usual trappings of Babylonian and Egyptian "goddess" worship.  In the myth, Europa is the daughter of the King of Phoenicia.   She is presented as a racial type, referred to as the "yellow-haired Europa."  This racial description of Europa, also applies to other mythological figures such as Diana, Dione, Venus and the blue-eyed Minerva.   It is no coincidence that the woman called Europa is of the same racial type associated with the people called "Europeans."   It is the myth of Europa that explains the early migrations of that race called "European."                The Europa myth places the god Zeus, on the Island of Crete, which approximates Homer's Aegean Sea location of Europe.  The Europa myth predates Homers works.  Zeus journeys from Crete, east across the Mediterranean to the Asian-African mainland nation of Phoenicia, where he sees the beautiful Europa.  In the myth, the blond haired Phoenician Princess had been troubled with a dream.  The dream was of two continents, both of which tried to possess her; Asia saying that she had given her birth and therefore owned her, while the other continent was yet unnamed (and virtually uninhabited).   This dream represents the European's choice of migration, from Asia-Africa to Europe.    Zeus, appearing as a "white" bull, acts so docile that Europa attempts to ride him, at which time Zeus carries her off to Crete, where she would bear "glorious sons whose scepters shall hold sway over all men on Earth."  Her first son was Minos, who became the legendary king of Europe's first civilization:  Crete.                The archaeological evidence of Sir Author Evans in 1900, and the findings of Spyridon Marinatos in 1932 confirmed the existence of an advanced civilization that existed around 1500 B.C. on the Island of Crete, which later vanished, almost completely.  The archaeologists called this civilization "Minos" after the legendary King Minos, son of Europa.  The mythical age of Greece and Crete is contemporaneous with the Golden age of Phoenicia and Israel and by the time Greece reached its Golden age, Phoenicia and Israel were no longer world powers.  The migration of the Blond haired, blue-eyed eastern Mediterranean people, took them to Western Greece, and those who stayed behind, in Africa, became the brown races that we now associate with the Mid-east.  The rediscovered Minoan civilization reveals two major cultural influences: Egyptian and oriental.  The Greeks were first called "Greeks" by the Romans, who called them "Greci" or Orientals, meaning from the "east."    The Greeks first called Phoenicians Phoenicians.  Phoenicia at this time was the primary launching location of sea vessels for "western" travel.                  The fact that the Minoan civilization reveals an Egyptian influence requires addressing the Egyptian question as to the development of Europe.

It is a historical fact that "Allah" was used as a name of a pagan God for generations before the cleaning out of the idols in the Kabah.

(Christian Era); died 633 C.E.    The following is based on books, manuscripts, texts and actual eyewitness accounts, too numerous to mention herein, preserved in original form throughout the centuries by both Muslims and non-Muslims.    Many people today are discussing Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. Who was he exactly? What did he teach? Why was he loved so much by some and hated so much by others? Did he live up to his claims? Was he a holy man? Was he a prophet of God? What is the truth about this man?You be the judge.  Here are the facts as narrated by thousands of people, many of whom knew him personally.  *He was born to a noble tribe to the lineage of the leaders of Makkah.  *His name comes from the Arabic root "hamd" and literally means "praised one." People at his time and until this very moment, praise him many times per day, may Allah exalt his mention.  *He never fell into the common practice of his tribesmen to worship statues, idols or man-made "gods."  *He believed that God was truly One God, and as such, He was to be worshipped alone, without any other "gods" beside Him.  *He held the Name of God in the highest of reverence and never took God's Name in vain or for any vain glorious purpose.  *He despised false worship and all of the complexities and degradation to which it leads.  *He adhered to the Commandments of Almighty God, just as prophets of old had done in the past.  *He never committed adultery, and he forbade others from doing it.  *He forbade usury and interest on money lending, as Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, had done centuries before him.  *He never gambled and did not allow it.  *He never drank alcohol or strong drink; even though it was a very normal thing for people of his time and place.  *He did not engage in gossip and used to turn away from hearing anything related to it.  *He fasted for days at a time to be closer to Almighty God and away from the narrowness of worldly attractions.  *He taught that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was the immaculate conception and miracle birth of Mary, and that she was among the best creation of Almighty God.  *He insisted even to the Jews of Medina, that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was the Messiah, the Christ, the one predicted to come in their Torah (Old Testament).  *He said Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, did many miracles by the permission of Almighty God, curing the lepers, restoring sight to the blind and even bringing a dead man back to life.  *He stated clearly that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was not dead, rather Almighty God had raised him up.  *He foretold that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, is going to return again in the Last Days to lead the true believers in a victory over the evil and unrighteous people, and he will destroy the Anti-Christ.  *He commanded the payment of charity to the poor and he was the defender and protector of widows, orphans and the wayfarers.  *He ordered people to unite with their families and honor the ties of kinship and he restored relationships between family members.  *He required his followers to engage only in lawful marriage relationships with women, and forbade sex outside of Almighty God's Ordinance.  *He insisted on giving women their proper rights, dowries, inheritance and property.  *His patience and humble attitude were exemplary and all who knew him had to admit to these virtues.  A. He never lied, never broke a trust never bore false witness, and he was famous with all the tribes in Makkah and was known as: "The Truthful" (Al-Ameen).  B. He never once engaged in sex outside of marriage, nor did he ever approve of it, even though it was very common at the time.  C. His only relationships with women were in legitimate, contractual marriages with proper witnesses according to law.  D. His relationship to Ayesha was only that of marriage. Their relationship is described in every detail by Ayesha herself in the most loving and respectful manner as a match truly made in heaven. Ayesha is considered as one of the highest scholars of Islam and lived out her entire life only having been married to Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. She never desired any other man, nor did she ever utter a single negative statement against Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention.  E. He forbade any killing until the orders came from Allah. Even then the limits were clearly spelled out and only those engaged in active combat against the Muslims or Islam were to be fought in combat. And even then, only according to very strict rules from Allah.  F. Killing any innocent life was forbidden.  G. There was no genocide of Jews. He offered mutual protection and forgiveness to the Jews even after they broke their covenants with him many times. They were not attacked until it was clearly proven they were traitors during time of war and tried to bring down the prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and the Muslims at any cost. Retaliation was only to those Jews who had turned traitor and not others.  H. Slaves were common in those days for all nations and tribes. It was Islam that encouraged freeing of the slaves and
AA11852896	Holy laughter is a practice promoted within some renewal and revival movements. Known in some Pentecostal circles. Re-introduced by, among others, Rodney Howard-Browne, the Vineyard Movement and leaders associated with the Toronto Blessing and some other renewal and revival movements. Said to be a manifestation of the presence or touch of the Holy Spirit.(1)    Holy Laughter is not biblical(2):  Acts 2:13. One passage frequently abused in the current Laughing Revival occurs in Lukes account of the day of Pentecost: Some, howev-er, made fun of them and said, They have had too much wine.    Leaders of this Counterfeit Revival, like Rodney Howard-Browne and John Arnott, seem bent on convincing their audiences that the apostles were manifesting all of the characteristics of drunkards. Why did they think the believers were drunk? asks Rodney Howard-Browne. Because they must have acted like drunk people (The Reality of the Person of the Holy Spirit, 2425). Laughing Revival advocates argue that, if it happened during the First Pentecost, then it should happen today in an even broader and more spectacular fashion in what many are calling the Second Pentecost.    If you look at the passage, the first thing you see is that only some said they were drunk. Second, those who identified them as drunk were scoffers. Others, far from being con-vinced of their drunkenness, were instead amazed that each of us hears them speak in his own native lan-guage (NIV). Luke says that they were amazed because these unlearned Galileans were declaring the wonders of God in a language they could understand. Thus, they were clearly not emitting incoherent noises in a drunken stupor or slurring their words, but they were cogently articulating the wonders of God. Peter, in fact, spoke so powerfully that 3,000 people stampeded their way to Calvary.    If the apostles truly were acting like drunks, Peter would have likely given an alternative explanation for their actions  attributing their bizarre behavior to an overwhelming spiritual intoxication. Instead, he corrected the scoffers by saying, These men are not drunk, as you suppose (v. 15).    In truth, the Bible gives no evidence that the believers acted like drunk people. The only behavior disclosed and discussed in Lukes narrative is speaking in tongues (vv. 411). There is therefore no basis whatsoever in the text for imagining or attributing any other action or conduct (such as laughing, falling down, etc.) to those Spirit-filled believers.    Ephesians 5:18. Another verse commonly misrepresented by Laughing Revival advocates encap-sulates Pauls admonition that we should not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, Paul urges, be filled with the Spirit. Being drunk in the Spirit, according to holy laughter factions, is the God-ordained counterpart to being drunk on alcohol  hence, the rationale for the inebriated-like state and behavior of those caught up in holy laughter.    A careful examination, however, reveals that in no way can this pas-sage be legitimately used to support spiritual drunkenness. To begin with, there is no reason to equate being filled with the Spirit with any form of spiritual drunkenness. In fact, the context of the passage indicates a consistent use of contrasts to differentiate ungodly behavior from godly conduct. For example, sexual immorality is contrasted with holiness (v. 3). Coarse jesting is contrasted with thanksgiving (v. 4). Foolishness is contrasted with wisdom (vv. 1516). Likewise, drunkenness is contrasted with being filled with the Spirit (v. 18).    To understand what being filled with the Spirit means, one need only read the next few verses which spell out the details in unmistakable terms: Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. (vv. 1920). Nowhere is there even a hint of the kind of erratic behavior promoted in Laughing Revival circles.    It is patently absurd to say that spiritual debauchery is the God-ordained counterpart to plain old debauchery. Or that precedents for indulging in holy immorality, holy impurity, and holy greed can be found in the Bible. Yet if holy laughter advocates are to stay consistent with their interpretation of verse 18, no other conclusion can logically follow  for the type of reasoning they use in claiming a biblical basis for so-called spiritual drunkenness can also be used to justify other sanctified acts of debauchery, immorality, impurity, and greed.    A representative picture of the Bibles stance against the Laughing Revival phenomenon can readily be gleaned from various portions of Pauls writings. The apostle listed, for example, self-control as one of the fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:23)  clearly the opposite of the uncontrolled and chaotic activities that are characteristic of holy laughter gatherings. Let us be alert and sober, Paul told the Thessalonians (1 Thes. 5:6 NASB) as he contrasted drunkenness with sobriety (vv. 78). And to young Timothy, he advised to be sober in all things (2 Tim. 4:5). With so much emphasis on self-control and sobriety, the burden falls upon holy laugh-ter proponents to reconcile their views with Scripture  a formidable, indeed impossible, undertaking.    Despite this impossibility, some still appeal to personal experience to vali-date their behavior. This, too, is a dan-gerous premise from which to operate. As fallen creatures our personal judgments are all too fallible  particular-ly when it concerns spiritual matters. We should not test experience in light of experience; rather, we should test experience in light of the final court of arbitr|`|AA11521149	were there also snake charmers at this "church" of yours?|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	I'm with Amdirien.  This is symptomatic of a trend in charismatic circles whose focus is on experience rather than scripture.  The theory is that one is so carried away by the Holy Spirit that one just can't help oneself.  The reality is, there are some people for whom the normal practice of religion is just not sufficient excitement.  To label this invalid...is inevitable to the sensible, but perhaps unfair to its practitioners.  Some of them truly do believe, and walk their beliefs, but just can't help feeling there ought to be 'something more.'

Some theories suggest that the spiritual dimension is a mere 3 feet above our own, and geographically reflects the earth, as it originally existed upon creation.  I personally like this concept.    That's supposedly why, when people say they see "ghosts" that they are seen to be "floating" in the air.  They are simply on the ground of their own higher dimension.      They can slow down their vibrations enough to visit us, but actually have full lives of their own.   They will however come when they know we need them or think of them.  But they don't have to "leave" what they are doing.  They have the ability to bi-locate, or be in 2 places at once.  They also tend to visit in the middle of the night when the earth is atmospherically more dense.  Apparently this makes it easier to slow down their vibration.    How do I know, I don't, not for sure, but this concept rings true to the inner me.  Maybe it's not just like that, but I feel it's something like that.    Can I prove it?  No, of course not.  But I believe it none the less.

As for the Adam's Apple, I've heard that when God called for Adam and Eve after they had eaten the fruit, what Adam was eating got stuck in his throat (which is why men had Adam's Apples, but women don't).
AA10183015	Bisexual people have feeling for both girls and guys, but they only have one romantic relationship at a time.     Being faithful to the one you're with is up to the person, it doesn't matter if you are bi, straight, lesbian, or gay. Cheating is cheating and being loyal is being loyal. Cheating is wrong and hurts both people. Be loyal or be in an open relationship (where both people know it's open) or be single.|`|62d13184392cb6c0f6cbed0fa25ba304aa	some are some are not.|`|debbb91e692d214c4091ed1e1798c0f7aa	I never have a gf when I'm seeing a man, not even when he requests it.

Most of the bi-folk I know - myself included - are monogamous.    For most bi-folk, bisexuality is the capability to be sexually and emotionally involved with more than one gender. It is usually something totally seperate from someone's preferred relationship style. (That is, the percentages would be about the same among monosexual people who prefer monogamous relationships, polyfidelous relationship, other relationship patterns, or who prefer to avoid committed relationships altogether.)|`|AA11463083	I'm always monogamous. Just because I like both sexes doesn't mean I'm going to go out and date both at the same time, I've never understood how that can be considered anything but cheating.|`|9c6dee0a108947fc8d4821e6f2072b63aa	one of my best girl friends is bi and she has both but neither her gf or bf care becuz her bfs the only one that can screw her and her gf eats her out|`|AA12059542	it depends on what works for you and your situation but I'm always in a monogamous relationship...... just because you are attracted to both sex-es don't mean you screw everyone!

There we were taught about our mortal life and what we would be doing there.The world was created for our mortality, and we were created as mortals to see if we would obey Him and grow to be like him.

After my son was born, lots of odd things were happening in our home. on night i heard my son cooing n giggling. i went over to his room only to see him looking up at a figure matching my hubbys grandmother. she was dead for almost 3 yrs. my son seemed to see this figure too. she vanished a minute later. About a year later, my son saw a pic of her at my inlaws home. he kept pointing to the pic n saying'memaa". he never met the woman when she was still living.

Little freaky.|`|4d05a65e138b9c9cbc808284fd888a3faa	This counts as a ghost story, but who knows what it may have been: One night I woke up in my room to an eerie feeling of not being alone. Everything was black and white and I got a little edgy and just went back to sleep. (Hey I was tired) A few months after that I get back from a date and I'm sleeping in bed when (I kid you not) I feel like someone (I say someone because if felt 'human') was kissing my mouth. It literally felt like someone was making out with me. Now I thought to myself "WHOA! This is NOT RIGHT. Maybe my nerves are getting weird and sending 'off' signals to my brain." But it kept going. Soon enough (as happens when you make out) I felt a 'tongue' flopping around inside my mouth. That was too much. I buried my face in my pillow and then it stopped. Now fast foward a year or two. It's Christmas and a bunch of friends and I are partying. My girlfriend is exhausted and goes up to my room to take a nap. Later she comes down and asks what I wanted. Apparently she woke up to see someone standing next to the bed looking down at her. Everyone in the house, aside from her, was in the room with me watching movies so I know it wasn't any of us. Fast forward again. My brother and I have switched rooms now and he has my old one. He wakes up one night to see someone standing in the doorwar looking at him. It's too early for me to be up and he said my dad denied it being him. Fast forward the last time another few years. I've moved out by now so it's just my brother and dad. They get into an argument and he goes up to his room and turns off the lights and goes to sulk around in his closet. He dozes off only to wake up to that sense of not being alone. Now here's the kicker. And you can believe I questioned him THOROUGHLY to make sure he was telling the truth. Suddenly he feels something on his feet. Someone or something is giving his feet a MASSAGE. Through the dim light he can see the skin on his feet giving way to the pressure of the "massage." Then I ask him: "what'd you do?" he smiled that smile my family is famous for and said "well....it felt kinda good so I let it keep going."    It sounds far out and made up but that is what happened to my family. All in the same room. Whatever it was, it sure like us I guess.|`|AA10221616	Yes. My uncle died of cancer in june of 2001. My room is situated so that if the door was open,  then there would be a triangle of light from the light in the hall. If anyone walked in the hall, I would see their shadow going by. This one night, I was getting ready for bed, and I see this shadow go by. I was all alone in the house, plus all the doors were locked, and I didn't hear any footsteps. Now here's the weird thing: The next day, my aunt ( my uncles sister who lives out of town)  called and told me that her dogs were running around and jumping up on the couch where my uncle always sat. She said the dogs acted as if somone was there. Beleive what you want. I am convinced it was my uncle!|`|AA10356839	Whether you believe or don't believe in ghosts is not important.

AA11146734	I smile a lot.  I sing pretty often.  I joke with people.  I've been known to wear funny paper hats from fast food places just to amuse my nieces.      In fact, I once did something quite like a square dance with one of my young nieces in the middle of a department store near Boston once.  (Bostonians don't see that has humorous so much, but I thought it was hysterical.)  She was delighted.    I've nicknamed my husband "Puddleglum."  If you've read "The Silver Chair," by C. S. Lewis, you'll understand.  It makes him laugh when he's feeling grumpy.    There is pain in life, and it needs to be faced and dealt with.  But there is joy in life and it needs to be embraced.    Much love to you!|`|AA10424973	Yes, I do.  I show it by smiling at people.

I had no choice to be here. But since I'm here and I know what my purpose is; then there's this burning in the inside that won't go away unless I stand in my purpose. So, when I'm done then I could die. I have no reason to live then to do what God wants me to do. But my joy comes from helping the youth. So, if I couldn't do that then my life wouldn't bring me joy. But while I'm living I thank God that I don't have to live in pain and sorrow while I'm here.|`|AA10608381	I do and I tell my Saviour, Jesus Christ, everyday that I am grateful to HIM for allowing me to see the light of another one of HIS glorious days. I show it by attending church and taking time out of every day to pray to HIM for all the blessings, tender mercies and graces bestowed upon me during my life. Right now I thank HIM for blessing me with a love of someone without reason and the will to go on and believing in that love, even though I am alone in this journey of enlightenment in a lonely world. It keeps me going even if it is hurting intensely every moment........|`|fb4b00c898b1ec8df2f053a83cb74f1daa	I keep a gratitude journal, and writing down the many amazing things I notice around me, helps me to notice even more: the beauty of Nature, the four seasons, colors, patterns.  Sounds of birds, the wind, music, surf.  I see all people as beautiful, and it inspires me to draw and paint what I see, as an expression of joie de vivre.  It also inspires me to be kind to others, and to live  in an environmentally conscious way, to respect our very beautiful world.|`|AA10755377	I would have to say that anyone that appreciates the joy of living shows it in different ways. For myself I guess it be simply that I enjoy life and everything it encompasses and since I do that I am a cheerful person who delights in trying to make others feel happy and peaceful. The simplest things gives me joy such as a beautiful sunrise or sunset,watching the waves coming on shore,watching the animals in the woods and just watching little children as they truely know joy!

My path has been one of betrayal, anger, hurt, division of family, ostracism,death, (loss of brother, mother, father, all grandparents, spouse & many others) I am just now learning how to survive alone, and have let go of the anger, resentment and betrayal of those I trusted fully. Due to this, I have become a better person and feel richer for it. My inner self is more enriched and powerful than it has ever been.

ba1e1102c1c52fd6ac5306bd6e265ca2aa	No, nada de eso. Cualquiera, el mayor o el menor, puede resultar gay. Eso no se elige, como dijeron por ahi. Se nace homosexual, pues estudios cientificos han probado esto, es una variante de la sexualidad, y se ha comprobado que la secuencia de los cromosomas del ADN es diferente en los homosexuales. Es algo impredecible, y nada tiene que ver si eres el hermano menor para ser gay.

Nell' antico i libri sono 47 e nel nuovo 37: una vera e propria biblioteca!|`|17009c4a0e25e9ec8738ba40d6647082aa	ma le studiate la notte?!|`|baed6e5da7182ff733cadb76b60a69f8aa	Risposta alla domandona: essere immortale e lasciare due testamenti stanno assieme come i cavoli a merenda, secondo la logica. Forse e` necessaria una nota di spiegazione tra la immortalita` e i testamenti.  Quanto all'immortalita`, questa scaturisce dal fatto logico anche per la ragione: il mondo di cui noi abbiamo esperienza risulta finito e secondo un ordine a portata di nostra logica. La stessa logica ci dice che l'ordine non puo` essere completamente fortuito, ma solo una mente intelligente poteva concepirlo (per analogia con il nostro modo di operare umano, altrimenti non ne scopriremmo le leggi). Basati sul principio di causa ed effetto, ad una creazione logica la mente si ritiene a ragione autorizzata a concepire una Causa non creata, non finita e quindi immortale, nonche` con le caratteristiche dell'intelligenza infinitamente superiore a qualsiasi nostra analogia sperimentale.  Quanto ai testamenti, credo ti riferisca alla Bibbia, perche` anche il Corano e altri libri ritenuti ispirati e sacri esistono nelle tante religioni che popolano il pianeta. Gia` il fatto della presenza di cosi` tante rivelazioni, fa insorgere il dubbio che di rivelazioni non si tratta, nel senso che Dio non avrebbe mai usato scrittori o saggi e profeti per fare da portavoce all'umanita`. E` piu` sensato ritenere che, con la volonta` di creare l'essere umano dotato di intelligenza, il codice testamentario sia inserito nel DNA dell'anima e della coscienza dell'uomo stesso, e che l'uomo non nasca come una tabula rasa in cui inserire dati a piacimento in una cosa cosi` fondamentale ed importante. Quindi, tutti i libri che l'uomo vuol far ritenere sacri, per quanto la fede li possa ritenere sacri, la ragione non li puo` ritenere tali con la logica, anzi, la stessa logica direbbe all'uomo che questi scritti, sia pur lodevoli, sono il frutto o lo specchio non sempre fedele della coscienza umana. Come una Costituzione non nasce prima dell'uomo, ma viene stilata dall'uomo, cosi` il testamento con Dio e` un impegno dell'uomo nelle relazioni con Dio, stilato su quanto la coscienza percepisce. Nei dettagli tutti notano divergenze e incomprensioni, appunto perche` l'uomo non puo` esprimere perfettamente quanto la coscienza gli dovrebbe suggerire. Cio` non toglie il valore di falsariga nel comportamento umano, senza pregiudizi di particolare monopolio della verita`. Due o tre testamenti o 100 testamenti non cambiano la sostanza dell'anima che li legge e sa discernere quanto di utile questi libri possano contenere. Quando l'uomo avra` capito appieno che le cose stanno cosi`, confido che ci saranno meno guerre di religione. In questo preciso senso la religione e' l'oppio dei popoli, perche`libri che non sono sacri in senso assoluto, sono usati per avanzare conclusioni illogiche di comportamento.  Un' ultima nota sulla inopportunita` di testamenti divini passati all'umanita` nello scorrere dei secoli, e` il preciso rispetto della sacralita` di Dio, che la nostra mente concepisce "giusto" e non portato a "favoritismi" verso una parte sola del genere umano. La giustizia di Dio, presa seriamente, postula alla ragione che parole speciali, miracoli, favoritismi di parte o illuminazioni particolari sono indegni del comportamento equanime di un Creatore, che per il rispetto giusto ed equo, indistintamente verso tutte le creature, logicamente non si presta a confidare a Tizio, Caio e Sempronio quello che dopo aver confidato risulterebbe di difficile comprensione alla coscienza delle masse. In questo senso credo che vada intesa la creazione dell'uomo a Sua ( di Dio ) immagine: non un robot, ma una persona capace di sviluppare una relazione con il Creatore, nel bene o nel male, secondo il libero arbitrio che la caratterizza. Da questo punto di vista, per assurdo, le presunte e lodevoli parole di rivelazione, potrebbero anche essere indice della negazione di Dio stesso, sfigurando la diretta comunicazione che ogni essere intelligente puo` e deve avere con il Creatore nel tempo della sua vita.  Per finire, la tua domanda riveste le tinte di ridicolaggine nei confronti di chi non solo crede, ma non e` neppure agnostico. La parola "Testamenti" scritta con la " T" maiuscola e` chiara ambiguita` di significato e di irrazionalita` o ridicolaggine che fai. E non sembra che abbia fatto questa domanda da gnorri. A tutti gli effetti la domanda riveste le sembianze di un umorismo che e` sicuro della ridicolezza nelle risposte. Intellettualmente, non direi lodevole, ma scarso ! Sei libero di vilipenderti o di scrivere un opuscolo umoristico, che non metterei tra religione e spiritualita`.   E "dulcis in fundo", ci sono esseri "mortali" che sono ricchi sfondati. sono stati tutta la vita in piazza ed in internet a predicare contro la guerra e muoiono senza lasciare "testamento", cosi mettendo in guerra tutti i parenti. Forse Dio, tramite persone sagge, sta tentando di fare questo e sta sortendo lo stesso effetto.

Risposi:  - Vedo un rotolo in aria:  lungo dieci metri e largo cinque.  3Allora egli mi disse:  - Esso contiene la maledizione che sta per colpire l'intera regione. Su un lato del rotolo  scritto che tutti i ladri saranno cacciati da essa, sull'altro lato che sar espulso anche chi fa giuramenti falsi. 4Il Signore dell'universo dichiara che manda questa maledizione perch entri nella casa di ogni ladro e di chiunque fa giuramenti falsi nel suo nome. Essa vi rester e distrugger tutto, dalle pietre al legno.

La legge di Dio        (vedi Luca 16, 17)  17"Non dovete pensare che io sia venuto ad abolire la legge di Mos e l'insegnamento dei profeti. Io non sono venuto per abolirla ma per compierla in modo perfetto. 18Perch vi assicuro che fino a quando ci saranno il cielo e la terra, nemmeno la pi piccola parola, anzi nemmeno una virgola, sar cancellata dalla legge di Dio; e cos fino a quando tutto non sar compiuto.  19"Perci, chi disubbidisce al pi piccolo dei comandamenti e insegna agli altri a fare come lui, sar il pi piccolo nel regno di Dio. Chi invece mette in pratica i comandamenti e li insegna agli altri, sar grande nel regno di Dio. 20Una cosa  certa: se non fate la volont di Dio pi seriamente di come fanno i farisei e i maestri della Legge, non entrerete nel regno di Dio.

If a Christian only listens to God whenever God commands him to do something that he was going to do anyway, do you think that this person is really obeying God, or just himself?    Jesus answered: "... If you love me, you will obey what I command."  John 14:9,15 (NIV)    BTW, I noticed that some of the answers, above, are quoting commands from the Law of Moses that both Jesus & Paul say no longer apply under the New Testament (I.E.: these commands being misquoted out of context by some of the people, above, were never applied to Christians in the first place.).|`|AA10025366	I pay very close attention to the bible because I believe it is what it claims to be, by inspiration of God.

5dec7075c50adb1c8446f085a331a6d1aa	Well, try to think of it this way. If you hear something enough you might start believing it's true. Religion may be this way. Though it depends on the people.     There are also people who truely believe in it. People willing to die for it. Some people need religion, something to give them hopes, things to look forward to after death. It gives them meaning.    You can inherit beliefs, who's to say what the correct religion is, or if you should believe. Some people are introduced to religion since as long as they can remember. They had no true option, it was just there.    Then there are those who question. They don't need religion, weren't raised into it, were given options, etc. There's no real reason, they just don't know.|`|AA10170942	That is soooo true... I've met so many people who could not tell my why they believe what they believe. And you're right... you can't be true believer in something unless you've considered all the possibilities and decided for yourself.   GREAT question! :)|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	The best answer I have ever heard about dealing with this thought is from children of Pastors and Ministers, and children brought up in the church itself.    Many , many report that growing up inside the church makes it more difficult to understand their need for salvation.    So, No I do not believe they inherit their beliefs, each one has to at some point come to the understanding on their own that they need salvation and GOD in their hearts, and to submit their will to GOD.    Now with Muslims , From what I have studied, they give their children no choice, they tell them that this is what they are and they are not to disbelieve it.    Jewish teach their children more heritage than religion now a days,  But unlike muslims, if the children go out looking for other answers , they are not killed.  Some Jews do shut out their family for a time if they leave the heritage, so to speak.    Christianity is the only one I know of that actually tells its children that they need to make a choice of what they believe and waits for them to make that choice.|`|AA10733606	You cannot inherit true Christianity since it is a choice that we all must make every day.|`|AA11613911	That's a great idea...|`|da77c5139784fd9753b548e7374c097daa	No I dont think we inherit our beliefs. I was raised a catholic and live as one for 11 years until I was led to the truth one fine day on a street corner, buy a Chrsitan man who led me to Christ. prasie the Lord for His sending that young man to me. I am a Christian and no longer a catholic.|`|40a4feb139015a77173fe96f03662c56aa	Sure there are alot of things that we get from imitating and following our parents.  However, there are many, many converts from all over the world that are outside of the religion that they are converting to.  I would not even say most of us, as there are also alot of children of christian parents that become atheists as well.    Too bad we can't have more people "inherit" the faith.|`|AA11518638	I gave my children the choice of religion. They went to many different faiths made their own choices. My Daughter even dove in to Buddhism. They decided  on what they wish to believe. I did not make that decision for them. I think a lot of people chose to make the decision for their own children and then those make it for their children  ect..... I think all children should have the experiences of different religions.|`|8017d451139922689a7cacfc342baf07aa	I agree that many people tend to "inherit" their belief rather than finding out for themselves.  Hopefully through life experiences each person will learn to figure their beliefs out for themselves.|`|24493466b9b4bf70143e1c13ac8a4a24aa	i dont think u inherit it, u just grow up around that certain religion and believe in it.|`|7813e828859ca086e870d11ff7aa498faa	I believe that in  most faiths people believe what they believe because they rarely go beyond the faith of their parents and explore other options.  A child of a Lutheran family is most likely to stay Lutheran, might explore other protestant faiths, but very few think enough about faith to actually explore other traditions.  Some religious groups really push the idea of deep exploration of that faith (Islam, Judaism, most evangelicals) but do not spend much time exploring other faiths except to criticize.    The only church I have ever found that truly embraces all faiths and asks its members to doubt, question and explore is the Unitarian Universalist church.    Most people have a superficial, unquestioning, unexplored faith, the faith of their parents, because they never bother to delve into what they feel, what others believe and to ask questions.|`|f48fbd941f26e0d0b1c9ce746138aa89aa	I agree completely. I converted independently from my family 2 years ago, and my beliefs are now truely mine.

AA11893109	Gay Caste system?      Hmmmmm    I dont' think there is one.  Gays belong to many communities, we aren't limited to dealing with one another -- and I've never observed much of a pecking order among us when we do deal with one another.    Some pretty bois are catty -- but I've had the prettiest friends all my life, since I was a young teen and right up to this day -- (and I do mean FRIENDS -- I've had a limited number of sex partners, but many friends) and none of them have ever cared that I was just ok looking, and not drop dead like many of them -- so many aren't catty.    The nearest thing to socio-economic regard I've ever seen is with the young ones, some of whom -- I've now been told -- are called "Tag Fags" by other gay bois -- because they check the tags in the clothing of people they like and won't go out with anyone who isn't wearing Abercrombie and Fitch and Hollister and A and E and so forth.  If you are wearing K-Mart, you are set aside by them.  That's kinda socio-economic, but I know fairly poor gay bois who save money and buy only a few new outfits a year, which they take good care of, but all of which are designer -- so I'm not sure it applies even there ---- that's more of a stylistic difference.    There are subdivisions among gays besides tops and bottoms of course.  Things like -- the arts crowd; gay nerds (I'm kinda one!!!); pretty bois/ice princes (I was always part of that crowd for friends, but never really one of them -- those are the beautiful boys that won't sleep with anyone but their boyfriends); nurturing (I'm deff. one of those); club rats; theater community -- there are more.  But those are actual "castes" parse -- and as you can tell from what I identified with, I'm part of one group, kinda part of a second -- but most of my close gay friends have always come from a third.    Don't know what else to say, if you define the question more narrowly maybe I can help.

Still, I can tell you from my own experience, that the popular people at MY school when I was in school, grew up to be average, ordinary adults, while the not-so-popular kids and "geeks", grew up to have great careers and very successful lives. Popularity in school is fleeting. It's what a person is like on the inside that matters, because THAT'S what's going to carry a person on through their adult lives and determine how successful and happy they will be.|`|HFcUAxDoaa	its hard to generalize but i feel like popular people are more interested in seeking approval, praise, and being idolized than in finding out what kind of person they truely are. in my experience they are pretty closeminded and ignorant, but hey, we can't have it all!     now if you're talking about highschool i'll tell you this. its f-ing highschool!!! it doesnt matter. if you want to make yourself feel better just know that once you all go off to college those popular people are going to get FFFAAATTT from drinking all the time and thinking they are bad *** and when you see them again you'll be able to laugh. just dont let yourself get fat too|`|AA10230935	You know, its funny, when you are in school you are so envious, you wish you could be one of the popular ones, life would be so much easier.

Their hair looked totally unhealthy, like it was colored one too many times, their skin was all droopy & wrinkled from all the trips to the tanning booth, they had almost all gotten knocked up and were divorced, they never had to "work" for anything so after their looks faded, they had no brains or a degree to fall back on, it was sad. They were now trying to hook up with me! Ha! The popular "studly" guys weren't much better, they had spent so much time adoring themselves, blowing thier $$ on clothes and cars that they too were broke, the ones that actually had decent jobs (thats a stretch) were "in" landscaping (whatever that means), selling cars or in real estate.

Do you like yourself the way you are, regardless of the opinions of others? If so, then your best bet is just to continue as you have been. I guarentee the next 4 years will be extremely annoying and you may not a large number of friends, but you'll keep your dignity, and you'll like who you are. Things will get better after highschool and as you get older. Your peers will mature a little more, and will become more capable of having non-mind-numbing conversations.     In the mean time, try to find some hobbies or interests to keep you occupied, and work hard on your education. Both will end up benefiting you more than wasting your time with simpletons.    If you don't like being the way you are - if you don't like yourself - then you may consider trying to change yourself. It's not easy, and i wouldn't recommend it - i find the best way to go is just to be the way that feels natural to you - but it's possible.|`|AA10859773	Hang in there.

Por supuesto, el cristiano siempre debe tener en cuenta que cualquiera que desee ser husped en [la] tienda de Jehov debe rechazar el soborno (Salmo 15:1,?5; Proverbios 17:23). ?Qu es sobornar? Segn el Diccionario de uso del espa?ol de Amrica y Espa?a consiste en ofrecer dinero u objetos de valor a una persona para conseguir un favor o un beneficio, especialmente si es injusto o ilegal, o para que no?cumpla con una determinada obligacin. Por ello, sin importar dnde uno viva, se considera soborno dar dinero o regalos a un juez o un polica para que no?aplique la justicia, o a un inspector para que pase por alto el incumplimiento de una ley. Tambin se considera soborno si con ello se pretende recibir trato preferente, por ejemplo, para conseguir el primer lugar en una lista de espera o adelantar a otros en una fila. Tal proceder mostrara, adems, falta de amor (Mateo 7:12; 22:39). Pero ?sera soborno dar un regalo o una propina a un funcionario pblico para obtener un servicio legtimo o evitar un trato injusto? Por ejemplo, en algunos pases es posible que los funcionarios pongan trabas para matricular a los ni?os en la escuela, admitir a una persona en un hospital o sellar documentos de inmigracin a menos que reciban una propina. O tal vez se retrasen al tramitar solicitudes de renovacin de licencias y permisos. El concepto sobre las propinas difiere de un pas a otro. En?lugares donde son habituales o se esperan, algunos cristianos quizs piensen que no?violan la ley ni?los principios bblicos si le dan una propina a un empleado para que haga su trabajo. En?algunos pases, la gente incluso considera tales pagos como un regalo que complementa el modesto salario del funcionario. Lo?importante es tener bien clara la diferencia entre dar un regalo por un servicio legtimo y ofrecer un soborno por un favor ilegal. Por otra parte, algunos testigos de Jehov, pese a hacer peticiones legtimas, se han negado a dar propinas a inspectores, funcionarios de aduanas,?etc., aunque esto se considere una prctica habitual. Dado que se conoce a los Testigos tanto por actuar de acuerdo con su conciencia como por ser honrados, a veces reciben un trato que la mayora de la gente solo consigue pagando (Proverbios 10:9; Mateo 5:16). En resumen, cada siervo de Jehov ha de decidir por s mismo si dar propinas para recibir un servicio legtimo o evitar un trato injusto. Por encima de todo, deber actuar de forma que mantenga una buena conciencia, no?sea un oprobio para el nombre de Jehov y no?haga tropezar a los dems (Mateo 6:9; 1?Corintios 10:31-33; 2?Corintios 6:3; 1?Timoteo 1:5).|`|5ca06499e1ca62c8a05944e098f33eb3aa	Pecado no creo pero si un delito y eso se paga con crcel, claro si este polica se presta  ya son dos que estn infringiendo la ley.|`|jPZ2n5iVaa	Logicamente que s|`|53f659e97e0696ab44667198da6c5a5faa	+2

izjq5VLdaa	IMPRINTING  How to Imprint Your Own Energy  It is possible for people to make a lasting impression on the telluric energy of a place. Also, we can transmit our own energy into the fabric of, for example, a castle, as the following story shows.           Garth castle, near Fortingall, Perthshire, is close to the geographical centre of Scotland. This is where 'the Wolf of Badenoch(1) exterminated many a clansman, binding them hand and foot and kicking them from the top of the battlements into the deep ravine below. Niall Stewart, a later owner of the castle and a descendant of the Wolf, also used the ravine to rid himself of two of his wives. As a punishment he was imprisoned in his own dungeons for over seven years, in a tiny walled-off cell, neither high enough to stand in, nor wide enough to lie down in. Eventually, he died a miserable death. Is it coincidence that in this tiny prison, now a cupboard, an unhealthy spiral could be found?             A recent owner was a Dutch lady, Maryse Vogelaar, who has stamped her own character indelibly into the ancient fortress. She felt, when she and her husband first saw the castle, that it 'rocked them in its arms', 'absorbed them'. When I surveyed the magnificent dining room, into which Maryse had projected her own energy, there were numerous small eddies of healthy spirals, with any unhealthy waves passing straight through, without staying to create any difficulty.           Maryse explained that, from time to time, she felt the presence of entities, but being an unusually strong minded woman, and more aware than most of any strange presences in the castle, persuaded them to depart, one by one. For me, it was a salutary lesson that we all produce our own energies, which can be imprinted into our surroundings in either a negative or positive manner.        A POWERFUL AND BENEFICIAL SHRINE  This was further impressed upon me in a house belonging to a Pakistani couple which had a number of unhealthy spirals through it, from subterranean water in this case. As I was about to survey one of its rooms, the owner politely asked me to remove my shoes, since it was a very special sanctuary for them both. The room was a beautiful shrine to the Indian mystic Sri Satya Sai Baba. I was intrigued to find that there was no unhealthy energy in it at all, unlike the rest of the house, which was full of unhealthy spirals. My divining rod for 'unhealthy energies' showed that there was a healthy spiral, centred on the shrine. Whether this was an input from the occupants or emitted from the shrine, or a little of both, I have no idea at present. What did intrigue me was that there was an unhealthy spiral immediately below the room. This should in theory have been radiating vertically and equally unpleasantly into the shrine room above. Some aspect of the shrine room was apparently keeping the unhealthy spiral at bay.          Another house had a very similar pattern, including a powerful spiral on one side of the bed, at the level of the husband's throat. He suffered from sleeplessness and panic attacks, as well as a painful throat. Only one room was devoid of unhealthy earth energies, and this was the room in which he used his radionic machine. Radionics is a means of 'tuning in' to people at a distance, using a sample of hair, blood, sputum, etc., and broadcasting remedies to the patient. I have some difficulty in coming to terms with this method, but it does work, and even helps to keep its immediate  environment free of unpleasant telluric energy.          So, even badly irradiated houses can be 'cleaned' by some aspect of the occupants themselves, without resorting to any of the practices suggested in Chapter 19. Perhaps buildings, or the fabric of which they are composed, are capable of picking up and absorbing some subtle emanations of the occupants, or it may be that it is the ever present telluric energies which may contain past information. After friends and I have a meditation group, for instance, there is always a healthy spiral to be found in the room, but not in the exact centre of either the room or the group, as one would expect. Even when I meditate alone with a little visualization, there is also a little spiral to be found, although it will disappear after an indeterminate period. This may be the origins of the 'housewarming party,' to give the new house and its owners the best possible start.             Similarly, in a church, with its different energy system, it is taboo to laugh or clap. Singing hymns, chanting or praying may enhance its special energies. It may be that vibrations of these types may 'inject' their special energies into the fabric of their surroundings. In an old monastery I visited recently, at Meigle, Perthshire (built from hand-cut sandstone) healthy waves radiated all around it, excluding all unhealthy ones.    HOUSE BUILT ON THE SITE OF A STONE CIRCLE  An area with a rock structure which contains a high number of subterranean fissures and underground water courses can initiate energy fields which may be imprinted by sufficiently powerful and emotional events, according to the late T.CLethbridge(1).           A lady who had recently moved from a house which had been built on the site of a stone circle told me of her experiences. The atmosphere in her house was incredibly bad. Her teenage son woke one morning with scratch marks down his face, a cross scratched on his chest and a trident symbol: a 'T' shape with a vertical shaft through it on his abdomen. She later discovered that a witch had been burned to death there some centuries earlier! They moved from that house shortly after, leaving the problem with the incoming family.             Another worried person in Crieff  asked me my opinion of his new house, which he had just moved into. Until then, he had a perfectly good job. He and his wife enjoyed good health and got on well together, but |`|aub4VI7aaa	Dear friend, faith in whatever thing you may have gathers power, suggestion power at first, but when it embraces a lot of people it grows stronger.

It is so beautiful    Desiderata       Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant, they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.      If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.      Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let not this blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.      Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.      Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams; it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.    Strive to be happy.

According to the Oxford Dictionary in my hand right now, democracy means as follows:    1.  government by the whole population, usually through elected representatives.    2.  classless and tolerant society.    A democrat is someone who favours social equality.    So let us talk of democracy in Islam.    Islam is democratic within itself.  The government of Islamic nations is by muslims and not any other.      But if you take the whole world, there is no democracy in islam because voting has to be by the whole population.  ANd the whole population in a democracy is not islamic unless in an islamic state.    Do muslims have a choice?  Of course.  In their own religion and country they have democracy because the whole population is islamic.  And none other.  So within themselves they have democracy.      But the minute they step outside of their home and country, it breaks down because islam does not allow it.    None to be worshipped but Allah, and Mohammad is the Prophet.    And who so ever does not believe in Allah and his prophet is a kaffir.    Got it?    That is why islam is not a religion that should be allowed in your home and mine because they are not able to be fully loyal to their allah and their religion.  Their democracy only works in an islamic state and we should not interfere.      We should take account of our homes because they have to convert our homes into islamic states if they are to fully devote themselves to islam and Allah.    They have to, under any circumstances, destroy your home to build their or their commitment to Allah as a muslim will break down and they will be banished to Hell.    So be ware.  I have analysed it to this.  I have been wrecking my brain for a long time now to understand and when you actually start understanding the meaning of the word democracy, you will realise that they are actually totally devoted to their Allah.    The only way you can protect yourself is protect your home.  If they invade it, whether now or later, they have to break your back and convert your home to an islamic state.|`|3865c94a2b2697d2331e90433a9ea2b3aa	I AM MUSLIM & I CHALLENGE YOU TO GIVE 1 VERSE FROM QURAN OR 1 HADEETH FROM SUNNAH (IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IS QURAN & SUNNAH YOU BETTER GO READ ABOUT ISLAM 1ST)  THAT SUPPORT WHAT YOU SAY , I CHALLENGE YOU AGAIN OK!!   NOW  HERE IS WHAT WE BELIEVE AS MUSLIMS       2:256 Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.   10:99 If it had been thy Lord's will, they would all have believed,- all who are on earth! wilt thou then compel mankind, against their will, to believe!   49:7 And know that among you is Allah's Messenger; were he, in many matters, to follow your (wishes), ye would certainly fall into misfortune. But Allah has endeared the Faith to you, and has made it beautiful in your hearts, and He has made hateful to you Unbelief, wickedness, and rebellion; such indeed are those who walk in righteousness;-   9:6 If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah. and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.   60:8 Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just. 60:9 Allah only forbids you, with regard to those who fight you for (your) Faith, and drive you out of your homes, and support (others) in driving you out, from turning to them (for friendship and protection). It is such as turn to them (in these circumstances), that do wrong.    mmmmm IS THAT VERSE FROM QURAN TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY?? >>> 3:159 It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (their faults), and ask for (Allah's) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then, when thou hast taken a decision put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him).     WE ARE THE ONLY RELIGION THAT BELIEVE IN ALL THE TRUE RELIGION THAT CAME FROM THE GOD ALMIGHTY >>>  2:136 Say ye: "We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam)."   5:59 Say: "O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah, and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before (us), and (perhaps) that most of you are rebellious and disobedient?"   FINALLY ACCORDING TO THIS VERSE I SAY   ''PEACE!''

He is speaking    Many people ask me how a preacher or priest in Christianity can ever go to Islam, especially considering all the negative things that we hear about Islam and Muslims everyday. Some people are simply curious, while others take a profound exception to my "conversion" to Islam. Some have asked how I could have turned my back on Jesus, or if I truly understood the Holy Ghost and some even questioned whether or not I considered myself as "born again" or had ever really been saved at all. These are good questions to which I will offer answers to at the end of this writing. I would like to thank everyone for their interest and offer my humble story, God Willing.    One very nice Christian gentleman asked me in email why and how I left Christianity for Islam. This is more or less a copy of the letter I sent to him.    Introduction  My name is Yusuf Estes now, but in years past my friends used to call me Skip. I have preached Christianity and worked in the entertainment and music industry since I was a boy in the 1950's. My father and I have established music stores, TV and radio programs and outdoor entertainment for fun (and profit). I was a music minister and even used a pony ride and entertained the children as "Skippy the Clown."    Once, I have served as Delegate to the United Nations Peace Conference for Religious Leaders. Now I am a retired former Muslim Chaplain for United States Bureau of Prisons, Washington, DC. and I join alongside many American Muslims, working with Muslim student and youth organizations as well as schools for Muslim children. As such, I travel around the entire world lecturing and sharing the message of the Christ of the Quran in Islam. We hold dialogs and discussion groups with all faiths and enjoy the opportunity to work alongside rabbis, ministers, preachers and priests everywhere. Some of our work is in the institutional area, military, universities and prisons. Primarily our goal is to educate and communicate the correct message of Islam and who the Muslims really are. Although Islam has grown now to nearly tie Christianity as the largest of religions on earth, we see many of those who claim Islam as Muslims, that do not correctly understand nor properly represent the message of "Peace, Surrender and Obedience to God" [Arabic = 'Islam']    Dear me, I am afraid that I got a bit ahead of myself. I was trying to give a bit of background of our work perhaps to see if it would in anyway benefit those who may being going through what I experienced while trying to resolve some of the issues of Christianity.    How It Happened  This may seem quite strange, while we perhaps may share a few different perspectives and concepts of God, Jesus, prophethood, sin and salvation. But you see, at one time I was in the same boat as many folks are today. Really, I was. Let me explain.    Born A Strong Christian  I was born into a very strong Christian family in the Midwest. Our family and their ancestors not only built the churches and schools across this land, but actually were the same ones who came here in the first place. While I was still in elementary we relocated in Houston, Texas in 1949 (I'm old). We attended church regularly and I was baptized at the age of 12 in Pasadena, Texas. As a teenager, I wanted to visit other churches to learn more of their teachings and beliefs. The Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, Charismatic movements, Nazarene, Church of Christ, Church of God, Church of God in Christ, Full Gospel, Agape, Catholic, Presbyterian and many more. I developed quite a thirst for the "Gospel" or as we say; "Good News." My research into religion did not stop with Christianity. Not at all. Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Metaphysics, native American beliefs were all a part of my studies. Just about the only one that I did not look into seriously was "Islam". Why? Good question.     Music Minister  Anyway, I became very interested in different types of music, especially Gospel and Classical. Because my whole family was religious and musical it followed that I too would begin my studies in both areas. All this set me for the logical position of Music Minister in many of the churches that I became affiliated with over the years. I started teaching keyboard instruments in 1960 and by 1963 owned my own studios in Laurel, Maryland, called "Estes Music Studios."     Business Projects In Texas, Oklahoma and Florida  Over the next 30 years my father and I worked together in many business projects. We had entertainment programs, shows and attractions. We opened piano and organ stores all the way from Texas and Oklahoma to Florida. We had earned millions of dollars during those years, but could not find the peace of mind that can only come through knowing the truth and finding the real plan of salvation. I'm sure you have asked yourself the question; "Why did God create me?" or "What is it that God wants me to do?" or "Exactly who is God, anyway?" "Why do we believe in 'original sin?" and "Why would the sons of Adam be forced to accept his 'sins' and then as a result be punished forever." But if you asked anyone these questions, they would probably tell you that you have to believe without asking, or that it is a 'mystery' and you shouldn't ask - "Just have faith, brother."    Trinity Concept  Strangely enough, the word "Trinity" is not in the Bible. And it has been a concern for religious scholars as early as 200 years after Jesus was raised up by Almighty God. I would ask preachers or ministers to give me some sort of an idea how 'one' could figure out to become 'three' or how God Himself, Who can do anything He Wills to do, cannot just forgive people's sins, but rather and had to become a m

e56347ff04a9835692fdf3687452ffe3aa	concuerdo contigo, a mi me gustaria tener el pelo largo, pero me incomoda y no tengo la pasiencia para cuidarlo.  Los aretes segun "yo" ni hombres ni mujeres deverian usarlos por que eso de andarse colgando alajas, a mi no me gusta, ni reloj de pulso utilizo.  los tatuajes talvez algun dia me decida pero sera en un lugar que solo se puede lucir solo en playa o algun lugar parecido es decir me tatuaria en la espalda, o en una pierna.  La razon es para evitar conflictos en trabajo , ya que los tatuajes muy visibles en brazos por ejemplo te pueden limitar para ciertos empleos.  Pero todo lo que mencionas en meramente cultural, es decir, depende del tipo de amistades que tengas e incluso el tipo de trabajo que realices, por ejemplo si voy a consultar aun abogado espero que parezca tal, es decir de traje, pelo corto sin aretes ni tatuajes y si contrato a un alba?il, tambien que lo paresca es decir buena constitucion fisica y vestido para el trabajo que va realizar.    bye y suerte|`|I6tjUJVqaa	No hijo mio es solo cuestin de moda, mira para atrs y veras que el pelo subi y bajo a travs de la historia, adems hoy en da si quieres traerlo por la cintura es tu problema, ojala que a mi me quedara jajajajajaja, ya solo recuerdos me quedan de mi bella cabellera.

Al tener el pelo corto, el hombre es menos propenso a albergar piojos, pulgas y dems insectos, y as puede utilizar su tiempo en pelear, ya que se reducen los factores que lo distraen.    Precsamente, el pelo corto se empez a utilizar en la poca entreguerras hasta los hippies, que protestaban, entre otras cosas, contra la guerra de Vietnam, y que mejor que usar el pelo largo.    Otra razn, en mi caso, es que desde que uso el pelo corto se me dej de caer, y me ha sido posible disfrutar durante ms tiempo mi pelo, a comparacin de mis familiares que en vez de peine utilizan un trapo para sacarse brillo.

Los aretes no me gustan para mi,pero tampoco es malo. Los Piratas usaban aretes y argollas y eran unos asesinos,y en ningun filme he visto un pirata homosexual.    En Mexico hay muchos hombres que les gusta tener el cabello largo por tradicion y promesas a la virgencita de Guadalupe. Y no son homosexuales por eso.    Tatuarse no me gusta para mi,pero similar a los piratas,y muy comun en los marinos,y presos. Y no son homosexuales.    Es una discriminacion mas, y muchos de los que critican son HOMOSEXUALES  tapaitos que no tienen valor de enfrentar la realidad y sus preferencias sexuales.    Como seas,te voy a aceptar,y PUNTO.

In quarta elementare la mia maestra ha avuto una relazione con un mio compagno di classe e nonostante i frati fossero stati messi al corrente di tutto la storia  stata insabbiata. La maestra insegna ancora presso quella scuola.  Un frate, morto lo scorso anno, ha avuto una relazione con una donna sino al 2006.  Un altro frate era un alcolizzato cronico.  Un altro ancora, morto da qualche annetto, irritato dal comportamento di un ragazzino gli ha spaccato un piatto in testa.  Ti posso dire che molte persone inserite in questo ordine sono diventate tali per necessit, convenienza o ignoranza...solo un paio per reale vocazione e degne di rispetto.|`|ed3bcdd1e3a96d6c446991c5f9ed31e0aa	Mio zio che adesso non c' pi,  morto a 85 anni, era entrato in seminario, ne  uscito e sono rimaste 'leggendarie' le sue discussioni e liti con il prete del paese.

Si  sposato e ha fatto l'insegnante di lettere. Non ha mai pi messo piede in chiesa se non al suo funerale. Io ho sempre provato curiosit per questo zio strano che usciva in motorino in canottiera e mutande e che un giorno  lanci delle uova alla commissione degli insegnanti che lo aveva contraddetto sul Carducci durante un esame per l'abilitazione a professore delle superiori.

Chiesa Cattolica SpA  un associazione con fini lucrosi che usa fin dalla propria fondazione, nonch dal suo successivo restyling tridentino, gli espedienti del ricatto e del terrorismo psicologico per accrescere il proprio potere politico nonch il proprio patrimonio.    Ora questi signori ci ricattano da generazioni grazie ad un libello che essi stessi, in virt di chiss quale autorit, hanno dichiarato direttamente ispirato da un burocrate che  talmente formalista da non meritare neanche un nome proprio ma un nome qualunque un po come fosse un numero di matricola: Dio. E un Dio che si chiama Dio  un po come un postino che si chiama postino anche allanagrafe    Chi al loro burocrate non si era allineato veniva fatto fuori, talvolta perfino fisicamente. E gli altri Dei venivano considerati tutti espressioni di una genia maligna e perversa. Che poi, ci sarebbe da aprire un dibattito, questo dimostra il manicheismo di questa fittizia religione monoteista.    Ecco quindi la risposta alla tua domanda, secondo me: chi ha ricevuto una educazione pertinente il credo/frode di questi signori prima o poi lo ripudia totalmente poich, avendo maturato un minimo di senso critico, non pu prestare fede alle loro assurdit.    Essi, tanto per fare degli esempi, hanno controllato la vita coniugale con la favola del matrimonio e represso intere generazioni tramite le loro pastorali costruite sui sensi di colpa; scagliato anatemi, scomuniche e maledizioni contro i dissidenti; distrutto lingue, culture ed opere artistiche differenti da loro; ricattato la vita fin dallinfanzia col loro battesimo e la loro comunione e mille altre ca***te del genere. In pi, tanti tanti anni fa, questi signori hanno perfino ucciso. Insomma a casa mia, in Toscana, grande paese di atei e bestemmiatori, si direbbe che questi signori reazionari hanno fatto pi danni della grandine!    Oggi sono costretti ad essere, almeno alla luce del giorno, pi flessibili e docili. A cercare il dialogo. Ma  tutto fumo negli occhi. Nei loro ranghi militano integralisti pari ai taleban. E i danni che hanno fatto tramite la loro morale perbenista e bigotta ed i loro credo contraddittori inculcati a forza nelle teste della massa si percepiscono oggi come un tempo. E ci che fa pi paura  lallinearsi dei media che non sanno parlare altro che di madonne, padri pii, papi mazinga/wobinda, miracoloni, miracolini, e suore bernardone!    Insomma i pretacci ne hanno combinate davvero troppe e troppo grosse perch, come ho detto, chiunque possieda un minimo di senso critico non decida di disconoscerne i dogmi. Attenzione alla parola disconoscerne piuttosto che rinnegarne come i loro sostenitori/pippaioli direbbero: io non rinnego niente dato che la loro fede non la ho mai chiesta; piuttosto mi  stata imposta in tenera et, quando non ero in grado di dire se ne accettavo o meno i dogmi. Ma credo che se lo chiedessero da adulti in pochi accetterebbero e la cassa diminuirebbe. Hasta luego.

Primero el Vaticano, las religones, los curas, etc... no son los encargados de eso, sino los gobernantes de cada pas.  Creo que sabes de las riquezas culturales que aporta el Vaticano, sus obras de arte, en fin todo, y no le puedes dar pocos mrito, por que si dices algo as supongo que por lo menos deberas saber que fundamentalmente gracias a la religin, fu posible el renacimiento, que cualquier persona que tengo mas de dos dedos de frente sabr el aporte que signific para nuestras vidas.    Ahora, como dije antes la religin no es la encargada de darle comida a nadie, si as fuera, es lo mismo que pidiera que los museos vendieran sus pertenencias para alimentar a todo el mundo.  Bueno, como deca, son los gobernantes los encargados de arreglar esta situacin, solo ellos, ya que si hicieramos lo que dices y el Vaticano se queda solo con su nombre, servira para alimentar a la gente por un a?o y luego seguira muriendo de hambre ya que esa no es la solucin. Conclusin, la gente sigue muriendo de hambre y hemos perdido las riquezas y las obras valiosas que posea el Vaticano.   Dime, de verdad crees que esa es la solucin?  No puedes tapar el sol con un dedo, el problema est, y es problema de dinero, sino de mala organizacin poltica. No des pescado, ense?a a pescar.

DE LAS RELIGIONES , tengo yo un criterio fuertemente formado, respecto a sus especulaciones para lograr objetivos, sectarios.    Pero eso no quiere decir, que voy a apoyar a los otros ruines.    Que quiero decir con esto. Continuamente se habla del oro del vaticano, y del hambre que podia paliar.    El mal no se soluciona con el oro del vaticano.     El hambre en el mundo, es debido al sistema hipocritamente cruel, que con toda la riqueza alimentaria que se produce, se tira casi una terina por ciento. La mala distribuicion de las riquezas, significa que hay quienes se apoderan de lo ajeno, a traves del comercio o industria, que se dice actuan legalmente.     Se podra decir, que el vaticano apoya a los ruines del planeta. Si estamos de acuerdo. Pero el mal reside en el sistema conque nos manejamos.    Y si a esto, le agregamos el manijazo que le da el sionismo internacional a traves de los medios, para desprestigiar el catolicismo, veremos que estamos manejados de una forma estupidaamente burda.    Sabemos lo que es el vaticano y el catolicismo y todas las religiones. Ellos apoyan el sistema. Pero la verdadera solucion esta en los que manejan el dinero a traves de las empresas.    .|`|44176710570bf732ee4ce304fd6764e3aa	Y VOZ LO PRACTICAS?

Esto me recuerda un sabroso cuentecillo, no se si era real, en el que estan impartiendo clases de Comunismo y le dicen al agricultor, que todo los bienes eran para repartirse entre todos, lgico, l actuaba con vehemencia y satisfaccin, el tema cambi y cuando tena que repartir sus bienes, junto con su burro, ya no estuvo conforme y dej sus ansias de comunista.  Con ello aclaro que bien podras ser t, la que iniciaras la entrega de tus bienes para la gente necesitada.|`|6d0da90a4e6cd4474fe30eb03ff744bbaa	MILLONES DE PERSONAS COMERAN CON TODO ESE ORO QUE EST GUARDADO  .|`|Ujh5tataaa	Las Riquezas de la Iglesia    Si la Iglesia posee tesoros ?por qu no los vende y ayuda a los pobres? ?En verdad esto sera la mejor solucin? Conoce las respuestas.   Por Eduardo Volpacchio      Los tesoros vaticanos ?Porqu la Iglesia tiene tantos tesoros en el Vaticano mientras hay tantos pobres en el mundo?    Esta sencilla frase hace sufrir a muchos catlicos. Se sienten mal al escucharla y no saben qu pensar, contestar, explicar ellos mismos se quedan un poco confundidos. Analicemos un poco el asunto.    Lo primero es acotar el problema, cosa no fcil. ?Qu es lo que se quiere decir con esa frase?    1. El cuestionamiento    Con el asunto de las riquezas de la Iglesia, no es claro qu es lo que se cuestiona o critica. Lo primero que se observa al analizar la cuestin es la falta de datos y acusaciones concretas. Estamos frente a un cuestionamiento difuso, nada claro, sin datos. Porque nunca es claro a qu riquezas se refiere, qu es lo malo de esas riquezas hipotticas, quines son los culpables (porque los pobres tambin son parte de la Iglesia), y exactamente cul es la culpa, qu es lo que se espera que la Iglesia debera hacer, etc.     A simple vista lo primero que se intuye es que se tratara de una acusacin a la Iglesia de insensibilidad ante el problema de la pobreza: ?cmo es posible que la Iglesia viva con tantas riquezas cuando hay tantos pobres en el mundo? Esta acusacin se presentara como hecho que desacreditara a la Iglesia en cuanto tal: es decir, una institucin que vive semejante hipocresa (decir que ama a los pobres, mientras est llena de riquezas que no pone al servicio de los mismo) no sera digna de ser tomada, en cuenta ni creda, ni aceptada. Esta sera una de las mayores vergenzas de la Iglesia, ante la cual no habra defensa ni explicacin posible.    2. Lo real ?De qu riquezas estamos hablando?    Seamos serios, que alguien aporte datos. Si se da por supuesto que en el Vaticano hay grandes tesoros que se diga ?qu tipo de tesoros? ?joyas, cuentas bancarias? ?dnde estn? ?cunto es su valor? Pero uno comienza a preguntarse, ?acaso alguien considera a la Iglesia como una institucin millonaria? ?Quien pensara encontrar obispos en las revistas con listas de millonarios tipo Fortune? ?Tiene la Iglesia fines de lucro? ?Da dividendos? ?Cotiza en bolsa?    La acusacin, de entrada, sugiere cosas falsas: la vida lujosa del Papa, obispos, curas, monjas, etc., que seran quienes usufructuaran de esos tesoros. Afn de lucro escondido bajo la excusa de la religin Adems estimula imaginaciones frondosas: al hablar de "tesoros" uno imagina cuartos llenos de lingotes de oro, cofres llenos de joyas, pelculas de piratas     Pero en la realidad, ?a qu "riquezas" se refieren? Basta que mires las pertenencias de la Iglesia que estn a tu alcance -tu parroquia, tu catedral- para no encontrar cosas lujosas por ningn lado.     Los "tesoros" -como los llaman- son un tesoro cultural, espiritual, histrico, pues se trata de iglesias, imgenes, cuadros, frescos, clices, ornamentos,  Esos "tesoros" no tiene ningn valor comercial, ni financiero. Estn dedicados al culto divino en iglesias o expuestos en Museos que conservan el patrimonio cultural de dos mil a?os de cristianismo.    3. ?Una solucin al problema de la pobreza?    Desde el punto de vista econmicoy si rematamos todo ?qu pasa?    Antes de entrar en el problema de fondo y demostrar que estamos frente a un debate artificial y sin sentido detengmonos a considerar el tema desde el mero punto de vista utilitario: lo intil de una supuesta venta del Vaticano.    Porque el annimo acusador insina que la Iglesia debera deshacerse de todo para el bien de los pobres y de los millonarios que participaran del remate Bueno, hagamos nmeros. ?Cuanto representa en plata todo lo contenido en el Vaticano? No tengo ni idea pero digamos ?cien millones de dlares? ?mil? ?diez mil? ?Qu es eso para el problema del hambre o del subdesarrollo? ?Alguien de buena fe puede pensar que sera una solucin real para los problemas de los pobres? Si se vendiera todo ?a cuntos ayudara durante un da? ?servira para algo? ?No sera ms bien un empobrecimiento intil de la Iglesia  (lo que en realidad estaran deseando los acusadores aunque se contentan con sembrar desprestigio con argumentos sentimentales y vacos de valor racional)?     En realidad, desde el punto de vista econmico, el slo hecho de plantear el problema de las riquezas del Vaticano es algo prehistrico, ya que hoy en da la riqueza no est dada por la propiedad de algunos terrenos o piezas de museo sino por marcas (?cunto valen los logos de Mc Donalds, Shell, Coca o Telefnica?), acciones en Bolsa, etc. Y de este gnero de riqueza -la que es real riqueza hoy- la Iglesia no tiene nada (ni siquiera tiene la Biblia patentada).    Cualquier Estado del mundo con un peque?o porcentaje de su presupuesto anual podra posiblemente aportar mucho ms que la venta total de todo el Vaticano, territorio incluido.    Adems, el problema de la pobreza no se arregla con una donacin: es un problema de desarrollo y requiere un flujo permanente de recursos. Por ejemplo, ?de qu servira la donacin de un hospital a un pas que no contara con recursos para mantenerlo, pagar sueldos, comprar medicinas? Hacer funcionar un hospital en no mucho tiempo es ms caro que el hospital mismo La deuda externa argentina ha llegado a los 250 mil millones Si se tratara de vender todo lo que existe en Argentina para pagarla no alcanzara Esto muestra que nadie puede seriamente proponer que vendiendo cuatro imgenes, tres iglesias y unos cuadros se podra arreglar algn problema de pobreza.  |`|tKzTMY47aa	Muy buena la pregunta y mucho tu respuesta.

No fue de darse pompa como lo hacen los religiosos de hoy y de siempre.  Cristo ense?o que el ser amigo de los polticos del mundo es ser traidor a Dios, por eso el no se meti en poltica.  Desgraciadamente las religiones del mundo estn mas interesadas en sus riquezas y en conservarlas que en ense?ar el camino de Jess.    Por algo en la Biblia en el ultimo libro el Apocalipsis se compara a las religiones del mundo con una prostituta, que se vende a sus amantes polticos.

Coloro che vedono le famiglie eterosessuali minacciate dalla presenza di analoghe famiglie omosessuali hanno una gran paura di aver perseguito qualcosa di cui non potranno pi fregiarsi con orgoglio di fronte a chi  diverso da loro. Se un privilegio si estende perde la sua connotazione di vessillo dietro il quale nascondersi e diventa forza con la quale proteggersi, e chi ha la coda di paglia, chi ha costruito la famiglia per il suo significato sociale e non per l'amore che dovrebbe sostenerla trema perch perde l'arma con con la quale si  scagliato contro ci che non pu comprendere.

For example, if you were to say:  The general rule is as follows:    Let's look at the sentence, "While I was showering, the dog dropped his bone."    Then showering would be in the imparfait since it's narrative. The dropping of the bone happened and it's over.  Period.  That is the passe compose.    If you understand this, you've mostly gotten the passe compose and imparfait down.  Of course, there are always going to be "situations" where you could make a case for one over the other.    Plus-que-parfait is another matter entirely as in:  "If I had had money, I would have gone to the Caribbean."  It's the past-past tense.      Hope that helps.

AA11106152	Mainstream porn can definitely get boring.  Thank god for sites like http://www.thepurplegriffin.com  They have a lot of the mainstream porn there, but also a LOT of obscure underground type porn.  They have video on their site that you'll never see anywhere else.  They even give you a 100% free trial to check them out.  This site by far has the most variety of non-mainstream porn I've ever seen|`|5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	Oh, I am a hundred percent with you.    I enjoy porn of all types, and mainstream stuff will do me in a pinch, but the more of it I watch, the less it turns me on.  The actors are unattractive because they look fake, wear way too much makeup, and have silicone-pumped bodies, the orgasms are faked (usually badly), women's pleasure gets no focus, or perhaps ten seconds at the most, the people don't seem that passionate or into one another, there are misogynistic overtones, particularly in straight porn . . . suffice to say, there are so many more downsides than upsides to mainstream porn.    I just go ga-ga for queer porn- "queer" not meaning gay so much as outside the normal boundaries.  Alternative porn is a new favorite, as is the new sort of queer lesbian stuff coming out ("Pornograflics", "The Crash Pad", etc.), some bondage stuff (it depends), and lots of hot amateurs- I particularly love couples, where you can see the relationship and love and passion between the people.  I still feel like most bisexual and "shemale" porn is really lacking- to me, it still feels like mainstream stuff.  I'd really love to see a porn directed by a transwoman, starring pre and post-operative transwomen, that was positive about their identities and seemed less exploitative than the "shemale" stuff that's usually out there (I haven't found it yet, but I'll keep looking).    Anyhow, I agree.  Alt porn is getting more and more popular, thank God.  I'll just keep on consuming it, and hope that they keep making more of it, because I'm tired of the same old thing.|`|df03a23231cbb181e95b5cd049015959aa	same here.... i agree with you!|`|AA10781920	Sorry, never watch it.

AA12059450	NO  It is completely illogical. Either he was who he claimed to be, or he was a nut or liar. There are no other options. The "good teacher" idea doesn't work. If he was only human, he was either deluded or lying. Most of his close followers were killed because they continued to follow him and teach others about him. If he had been anything but what he claimed, they would have denied him rather than face execution.|`|AA12230903	*sigh*    jesus never claimed to be god. read your own bible there people. he calls himself "son of god". we're all sons and daughters of god according to the judeo-christian religion, no? otherwise its all pretty cryptic, and he never says that people should worship him as god. she says that the way to heaven is through him, ie, his teachings. which were meant to bring jews closer to god. he was, like the other prophets, trying to make jews less like their pagan neighbors. interpretation is key here. which is why there was such a problem in the early centuries AD about the divinity of christ. people were divided on this issue, no one could really prove what jesus meant one way or another.     i've read the bible with a critical eye. even if you are a believing christian, i suggest you do the same, not because i want you to stop believing in god, but because to better argue your point you need to see things from the other side as well.     i've never had anything supernatural occur in my life.     religion is religion. not a fairy tale.|`|4cfa2f8d5b2034431cf172500c7e4bf2aa	Would a wise philosopher call Himself God and tell people to worship Him?

It is not at all clear that religion is "just a fairy tale".|`|edfaa3878a1423f4923c2467367d76d0aa	out of billions and billions of galaxies and thousands of stars in it and several planets dont u think some supernatural power has made just one earth so beautiful and suitable for life?? and out of millions of life forms dont u think its work of some supernatural thing that human form is so advanced? till now no one could prove theory of evolution. it still remains a theory not a fact. when there r sevral un-natural things happening, y cant we believe that jesus had supernatural powers? i am a muslim and i dont believe that jesus is God but still i believe that jesus had supernatural powers(with the help of God).|`|968ad95e4e638a9d6a5dfbcb484c509baa	No! And I for one, have seen supernatural activity.    I've seen disembodied shadows on several occasions and have seen a shoe glide across the floor all on its' own, a rocking chair (indoors) that rocked by itself and other things......    The last time I saw a shadow, my two sons and I, were outside on a bright and sunny day. Suddenly one of my sons pointed out the shadow that was right there among us. It was weird! I turned and sure enough, our shadows started from our feet and laid out flat on the ground. This other shadow- was flat on the ground too- but there was no physical body projecting it!    And almost as soon as it noticed that we could see it- it took off running to an old shack at the end of the lot. I ran after it, but it went right thru the wall. I got up to the door entrance, looked inside towards the walls, b'cos that's how I'd seen all the others- as if in the walls, but I saw nothing! I didn't go in cause it gave me the creeps!|`|AA12176434	There is, in spite of what Christians think, no evidence direct or otherwise that any such person as Jesus ever existed. So philosopher or God really makes no difference. This is the truth and if they want to tie me to a stake and burn me that is their problem|`|AA11164030	A wise philosopher but a liar?    Either he is God and the Son of God as he claimed or he is a liar and you cannot trust anything he said. You cannot have it both ways.      As a favorite singer says "it's harder to belive than not to"    You need to look at the evidence and make a decision. Either I chose to belive this based on the evidence or I chose not to belive it reguardless of the evidence.|`|aa61729757fd73e81faee4bbf6aab8d9aa	Isn't it more rational to believe Jesus was just a wise philosopher given the fact that there is no?   ans. your perception is wrong!    ========    tangible proof today that he had supernatural identity?    ans. He is the Son of God, therfore he is supernatural    ========    Has anyone ever experienced anything supernatural in his life?     ans. yes, many experiences.  2 thousand yrs back Jesus was not popular, He made predictions on rising of many false christ and prophets.  Look your surroundings now,  there are lots of religious organziation used Jesus name.      ========    So how can you believe in something supernatural?     ans. The Bible as guidance, everything is there.    ========    Isn't it clear that religion is just a fairy tale?    that is true if you refer to religion on Bahai faith, hindus, catholics, jehovah's witness, mormons, seventhday adventist, baptist, etc....    But for pure and true religion as practiced by the church of God it is not fairy tail.  why I say this? In James 1:26-27 it says    26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.     27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.       =============  for more info:  watch http://www.angdatingdaan.tv  visit http://www.angdatingdaan.org|`|eb3d15b094e8856f1de3852d197088a7aa	Religeon is 'real' in each believer's mind, and most real religeous people say it's in their soul, but I wonder if they know the difference.  I know there is a supreme being 'so to speak' and I call it GOD, but I also know he wouldn't have time to be creating more universes, and taking care of individual beings on the small univers we call the Milky Way, much less, the little galaxy we live on with the tiny little planet of earth, with many countries on, and then in my country, then in my state, thousands of cities, then in my city, millions of people, thousands of churches, and then in my chruch, thousands of people with problems, then at my house, with my one problem.  God is real, but we have to be also.  The bible is man written, centuries ago, before the population was in the billions, it was in the thousands, and there is prrof that humans existed several thousand years before Jesus believers began writing the Bible.  He was a philosopher, but he was strung up, because he betrayed his jewish people and their beliefs, and it has nothing to do with the world today.  His mom had sex with a guy, and he was basically fatherless, so in her being ashamed, along with her relatives, they made up the whole thing, and it got written.  I could research more, but it really doesn't matter to me tonight, maybe some other evening.  Ron
c2bcacc85f41a94aa996cf8a8d2dcddfaa	La lancia, conosciuta come Heilige Lance (Lancia Sacra) ed esposta nella Weltliche Schatzkammer (la Stanza del Tesoro) del palazzo dellHofburg a Vienna, ha fatto una lunga strada prima di fermarsi in Austria.    Si dice che per qualche tempo fu in possesso di Maurizio, comandante di un distaccamento dellesercito romano noto come la Legione Tebana.  Si narra che nel 285 d.C. i 6666 soldati di Maurizio si rifiutarono di prendere parte ad una cerimonia pagana e, senza opporre la minima resistenza, si lasciarono trucidare dal generale Massimiano, il quale, poco dopo, venne proclamato co-imperatore da Diocleziano.  La Lancia di Longino pass a Costanzo Cloro e quindi a Costantino il Grande, suo figlio, il quale, abbandonato il paganesimo per abbracciare la fede cristiana, la brand in occasione della celebre battaglia di Ponte Milvio, durante la quale, nel 312 d.C., sbaragli le truppe di Massenzio, riportando una schiacciante vittoria.  La Lancia Sacra pass di mano in mano, da imperatore ad imperatore e fu grazie ad essa che, secondo la leggenda, nel 385 d.C. Teodosio sconfisse i Goti.  Nel 425 d.C. il generale Flavio Ezio respinse Attila e Carlo Martello, nel 733 d.C. sconfisse gli arabi a Poitiers.  La Heilige Lance, in seguito, pass da Carlo Magno agli imperatori Sassoni, tra cui Ottone I il Grande e poi agli Hohenstaufen, nella persona di Federico Barbarossa ed infine agli Asburgo, che la collocarono nella Stanza del Tesoro del palazzo dellHofburg a Vienna.  Una volta posta allHofburg, venne aperta una fenditura nella lama della lancia, allinterno della quale venne introdotto un chiodo, ritenuto essere uno di quelli impiegati per crocifiggere Ges.   questa la Heilige Lanze, per la quale Hitler ebbe una passione morbosa.|`|1c59c463fc32eab015c352e5bcc5687daa	Nella tradizione cristiana, la Lancia di Longino (nota anche come Lancia Sacra o Lancia del destino)  la lancia con cui, secondo il Vangelo di Giovanni (19:31-37), Cristo fu ferito al costato dopo essere stato crocefisso. Nel pi antico riferimento a questo episodio, che si trova nel Vangelo di Nicodemo, a colpire Ges fu un centurione di nome Longino; a questo si deve il nome latino dell'arma, Lancea Longini. Fonti successive identificano il centurione con il nome Gaius Cassius. La Lancia del Destino svolge un ruolo importante nella mitologia del Graal e, di conseguenza, nel ciclo arturiano, in cui viene identificata, tra l'altro, con l'arma che ha ferito anche il Re Pescatore.

Poi la famiglia, eggi, lei deve fare la madre mentre tu tene lavi le mani, perch i figli sono competenza della madre, mica del padre. Certo se fai il figlio di tua moglie non puoi fare il padre dei figli.  Crescere no eh? Badare a te stesso invece di farti spupazzare come un bambino no eh? Eppoi se la donna sta in carriera ti dimostra che non sei superman, sai che smacco.  Non puoi fare il pupo dominatore della donna, questi tipi di maschi non convincono pi, che si lamentano come cuccioli quando stanno male, che hanno paura degli ospedali e dei malati, che hanno paura dei morti che, come i malati, toccano solo le donne perch i maschi hanno paura.

M89ifflRaa	Even among those of us who view the rapture as imminent (the pretribulational view) there remains disagreement concerning whether Jesus Himself ever prophesied of this blessed hope. The debate primarily involves the Lords Olivet Discoursein particular, verses 36-51 of Matthew 24.     Few deny that Jesus, in His humanity, knew of the rapture and alluded to it at least once in the Upper Room to comfort His disciples: And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself, that where I am, there ye may be also (John 14:3). Many, however, insist that the Messiahs sermon on the Mount of Olives was meant exclusively for the nation of Israel and not the church, so He could not have been referring to the rapture. This argument fails to acknowledge that the message He preached was in response to questions raised by His disciplesthose believing Jews whom He would one day receive unto Himself in the clouds in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:17).     Some might also argue that the rapture was a mystery until the apostle Paul revealed it later in his letter to the church at Corinth. But of all the various mysteries presented in the New Testament, each refers to doctrines not previously disclosed in the Old Testamentnone preclude prior New Testament teaching of some facet of that doctrine. By divine design, clues are needed to unveil this mystery concerning certain details of the rapture. Although the apostles supply many of these clues, some essential pieces of this puzzle can be obtained only from our Saviors teachings.     For clarity and brevity, allow me to assign definitions to the following terms: Phase 1 will refer to the first part of Christs future appearing, which we call the rapture. This is His return for believers (occurring prior to the tribulation period) to resurrect and/or glorify their physical bodies and take them back to Heaven with Him (see 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 and 1 Corinthians 15:51-53). Phase 2 will refer to the second part of Christs future appearing, which is often called the second advent. This is His return with believers (occurring at the end of the tribulation period) to destroy Satans armies, rescue His chosen people, and establish His earthly kingdom, reigning over all nations from the Throne of David in Jerusalem (see Isaiah 9:7 and Daniel 9:24b for starters).     I believe that Jesus prophesied both Phase 1 and Phase 2 in the Olivet Discourse. To assert that He spoke only of Phase 2 requires the explaining away of many apparent contradictions. But the inspired Word of God is without error. And since our faith is entirely reasonable, it is unreasonable to settle with interpretations of Scripture that are full of logical contradictions.     Verses 4-34 of Matthew 24 speak, indisputably, of signs pointing to both the tribulation period and Phase 2. There are both definite and indefinite signs that must precede Phase 2. A definite sign, for example (a major one), that is implied in this passage (and explicitly declared elsewhere) is the reestablishment of the nation of Israel. Another is the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet (verse 15). Examples of indefinite signs that must come to pass can be found in verse 7: nation shall rise against nationand there shall be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes This type of sign is more general in nature and is measured by increased frequency and/or severity. In this portion of His sermon, I believe the Lord clearly answers the disciples second question, What shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the age?     When we come to verses 35 and 36 the literary intent is unmistakablea transition takes place. In verse 35 Jesus takes us beyond the Millennium to when the heavens and Earth will be destroyed and remade, but He reminds us that the words He spoke would never be destroyed; His Word would stand true forever (see also Psalm 119:89, 152, and 160). Surely, the Creators words can never fail and therefore can never be contradictory. But He continues His sermon with words that would be just thatcontradictoryif not understood correctly.     The very next words He speaks, But of that day could have been easily translated from the Greek as follows: But concerning that day... Which day? Of course, He is not speaking of the day when the heavens and the Earth pass away. He gives us a clue: No one will know that day and hour (verse 36), but many will know the day and hour of Phase 2when ye shall see all these things [signs], know that it [Phase 2] is near, even at the doors (verse 33).     At this point in His sermon, it seems clear that Jesus is introducing a new subject. This same sense is felt in Mark 13:31-32 and Luke 21:33-34. It is here, I believe, that Jesus begins to answer the disciples first question: When shall these things be? He prefaces His answer by telling them that no one knows when. Apparently, we should always be ready for that day to take place, always watching, just as the master of the house needed always to watch because he did not know when the thief would come (verse 43). It is no wonder that both the apostles Paul and Peter warn, the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night (1 Thessalonians 5:2, see also 2 Peter 3:10).     Consider for a moment the concept in verse 36 that no one knows. Is this true of Phase 1? Yes. What about Phase 2? No one? What about those who dwell on Earth during the tribulation? They can know from the Bible how to calculate in advance the exact number of days that will elapse from the day Antichrist confirms a covenant with Israel (a major definite sign) to the very day of Phase 2. That is, Phase 2 will occur exactly 2520 days after the tribulation period starts (360 days per prophetic year x 7 prophetic years). Again, w|`|omkbQbcdaa	War and pestilence are signs of the end times prophesised in the Bible.  Jesus does save us, he currently does not save us from the worlds' problems, but from eternal death and hell.  Jesus says so himself in the Bible, "In this world you will have troubles.  But take heart!  I have overcome the world."  John 16:33.  However, Jesus wiil save us from the worlds' troubles when He returns as the King of Kings and eliminates this world of sin and hate and establishes His Kingdom here on earth.|`|5d01690817893573b8fa96ea5cd9581daa	Yup.

I was once told that in the day not only were the women asking questions to their husbands across the room but if they heard something that did not agree with their spirit, they also voiced their opinion. I believe that Paul was trying to get some order in the church and felt that women should wait until they got home to ask their husbands to answer the questions. The Bible in no way is racist to women.|`|Hg3eQgalaa	First, let me say that Jesus sent a woman to preach to the apostles, that He was risen.  Without the resurrection, there is not Gospel and no salvation.   If it didn't bother Jesus, it shouldn't bother anyone else.  He really loved and cared about women.  The Greek word for "tell" is the same as for "preach".  John 20:17-18.    The topic question is answered in the quoted passage, v. 35.  He says to ask the husband when you get home.  Evidently, the married women were calling out to their husbands.  Pretty dangerous at that time, as Roman soldiers were prowling around, seeking whom they could destroy.  The church meetings had to be conducted quietly, for the sake of safety. Paul knew that; he used to seek out Chirstians and have them killed.    At that time, and in that culture, women and men sat in separate sections in the place of worship.  That still happens in certain cultures today, even in the Christian churches, because that is the CULTURE. Anyway, at that time, the women would call out questions, because they couldn't always hear the person who was speaking.  Thank God for microphones.    The other clue is when he tells them they have to be silent according to the Law.  That was the law, and custom of the day.  There were certain things Paul admonished according to the Jewish laws and customs of the day.  He was a former Pharisee  (Phil. 3).  There were also situations of safety, because of the intense persecution of that time.  I don't have time or space to go into a lot of that here, but I am sure those who truly study, will research and find the information.    Paul took a lot of time commending the women who were in leadership positions at the time (Romans 16:7).  The people who taught him were Priscilla and Aquila, a husband and wife pastoral team.  He usually mentions HER name first, implying, according to the custom of the day, that she was the one who held a leadership position (Acts 18;  Romans 16:3;  1 Cor. 16:19; 2 Tim 4). Some women are called to be leaders, some are not.  The same goes for men.  Paul noted that there is no Jew or Greek, male or female, bond or free, in Christ (Gal. 3:28).  God is no respecter of persons.  GOD  always uses people who are willing.    People don't really believe women should not speak in churches, otherwise they wouldn't have women doing the announcements, or singing, or any of that.  You won't find any Scriptural support for women working in the nursery, cooking for the church, or bringing a pastor a glass of water.  Is there any Scripture that tells women to put money in church?    If God intended for men to be in charge of everything, then that would include the nursery, the Sunday School, the kitchen, and everything else the women do.  In the home of Martha and Mary, Martha got all involved in cooking for Jesus and His apostles.  Now, WWJD?  Jesus told Martha that the cooking was NOT necessary, but that her sister Mary had made the better choice, by choosing to listen to the Word instead of cook (Luke 10:38-42).  So, Jesus really said "You don't have to cook for us"?    Just another way to discriminate, that's all.  It would actually make more sense to say that men can't preach, because men were the ones who crucified Jesus.    My own point is this:  No matter who you are, male or female, seek God's face about what He called YOU to do, specifically.  Ask the Lord, and do not fear His answer.  If he tells you to preach or teach or pastor or minister, or help in some area, get prepared to do that.  Like Jesus, you will meet opposition.  However, you will also meet Jesus one day, and will have to answer to Him.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	The culture at the time is my belief.|`|AA11048920	Obviously, Paul was a misogynist.|`|UfhKZx5Taa	he wasn't a fan of women, was our Paul!|`|19f88100943ba2cb89f27be8c8dd0a41aa	BECAUSE WE ARE FREE WILLED , SPIRITUAL , INTELLIGENT !

Therefore Paul said be silent and ask after. I have been a Christian all my life, some 50+ yrs and I have not found the Church to be against woman. Woman have been fighting for their rights for years, the customs of the day also filter through to the Church. I was a deacon in my Church, prayer coordinator and serviced on the Worship committee so I don't buy this poor Christian woman sob story.|`|AA11686091	I'm a Christian woman.  First of Paul was telling the Corinthian women to be quiet because they were sitting on separate sides of the synagogue and yelling the questions to their husbands. It wasn't in keeping with being able to learn.  Second it's only told to the church at Corinth, since it wasn't repeated, it's not a pattern for us to follow.    Jesus treated every woman He encountered with respect and honor so how could Christian men do any less.  Paul spoke well of the women who helped him like Lydia.|`|MhU8li2vaa	Well i thought everybody is expected to be silent in church|`|b5b3a78cd70d9312849f0cb75028d94aaa	They were giggling or acting otherwise inappropriately.

In the Synagogue in that time women sat separate from men.  On occasion a woman would interrupt to ask her husband what something meant.  Paul was telling women to wait until everything was finished and ask their husbands to explain then.  It wasn't about keeping woman silent. It was about keeping things orderly.    Christianity is not demeaning to women.  God assigned women as judges in the Old Testament.  The Apostles honored women as leaders in the churches.  The Epistles tell men over and over to treat their wives well.  Just because some people take things out of context doesn't mean it's what the Bible teaches.|`|FdugwTExaa	Paul was answering a letter from the Corinthians.    The women were being disorderly and loud in church.  Paul told them the women should be submissive to their husbands, if they had questions they should ask their own husbands at home.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	We are to be silent in the sense that we to not teach men or preach.  I don't find this at all demeaning.  Men are to be the leader in our family, so they are to lead us in church as well.  God made us, the female to be the help meet and to be submissive to our husbands.  I had  a hard time understanding this concept too while I went to the Church of the  Nazarene, it  also didn't' help my preacher didn't really know or preach the Bible.  I started going to an Independent Fundamental Baptist church and whoa a new concept, preaching from the Bible and I got my heart right with God.  I understand what Paul is saying.|`|5619dcc64d14e591a017507b07c0dc9daa	IN THIS VERSE WHAT PAUL IS EXPLAINING TO THE WOMEN IS TO PLEASE DONT INTERRUMPT THE PREACHER  WHILE HE WAS PREACHING, BECAUSE WOMEN CANT HAVE PATIENCE IN ANYTHING AND WHILE THE PREACHING WAS BEING DONE SOME WOMAN WHOEVER INTERRUPTED THE PREACHER TO ASK HIM WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS. BECAUSE FURTHER ON IN THIS VERSES, PAUL TELLS WOMEN TO ASK ANY QUESTION THEY HAVE TO THEIR HUSBANDS AT HOME,   SO THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NOT LETTING WOMEN SPEAK THEMSELVES IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES.|`|27388c4872fe2905671d411dc9f76026aa	Back then, it was custom for men to run the service to ask questions, etc.  Women were in a separate place and so were the Gentiles (non-Jewish believers).   They could listen, but to keep things in order, they were not allowed to interrupt service.  They were to ask their husbands.      Many men take this out of context just like they take the "submit to your husbands" scripture out of context.   There were female prophets in the Bible (Anna) and A female judge (Deborah).    God is not a respector of persons and if He wishes to use a female to get the glory, He will.   Even in heaven, there will no longer be male and female we will be as the Angels are.  In my church, we have a mixture of teachers. At Bible study, if a question is asked a male can answer or a female can.      I don't know any Muslims so I cannot say if their practices are demeaning or not.  But I can say that Christianity isn't demeaning to women.        --Peace and Blessings :)|`|pstDxa7zaa	Chapter 11, v 5 talks about women praying and prophesying (yes, with their heads covered; that was a cultural thing).  There are lots of female Biblical leaders, even heroes.  It must have been a specific directive, toward a specific group of women; it's too bad we don't have more context.  Wish I could remember the verse about how in Christ there is no longer distinguishment between Gentile or Jew, slave or free, woman or man.  My denomination ordains women, though.|`|jT4kKAn8aa	This passage bothered me when I first read it, but the more I thought about it, the more I think I understand it.  You could also look at 1 Timothy 2:11-15.  I truly believe that God created men and women differently and we have different purposes.  I believe that a man should be the head of a marriage (and the verse that gets people flustered is that wives should submit to their husbands... but they forget that it goes on to say that husbands need to love their wives - if you love someone, you will always do what's right by them) and I also believe that men should primarily be in charge at a church.  However, in the 1 Timothy passage (I'm not sure about the 1 Corinthians one), this is a specific letter from Paul to Timothy regarding how the church in Ephesus was being run.    The Bible doesn't demean women, it just shows them as different - women have traditionally had the quiet, graceful, composed personality, as opposed to men's personalities.  Why is this type of personality a bad thing?  When it speaks of men "ruling" over women, it assumes a couple of things: first, that the men are Christians who are knowledgeable in the ways of God and are following God, and second, that the men will be treating women with the same love, devotion, and thoughtfulness that Christ shows to his believers (the church).    I do believe that the roles of women and men have shifted, as women have become more educated and men have become less God-led.  Now, if a woman is more educated in Biblical studies and has a deep relationship with God, I don't think it would be wrong for her to teach a man that is not educated in Biblical studies or doesn't know the Bible, etc.|`|edda3eb156631151ac20b3f5acb9e821aa	That's what God had ordained, read  Corinthians chapter11. Just because Paul says that women shouldn't speak in church doesn't mean that he is against women. He is simply stating what God has put in his heart to say. In Christianity women and men are equal but God has called the men to have authority (not a boss, or macho man) the woman because man was born first. In the book of Ephesians the Bible states that " The man is the head of the wife". That word there "Head" in greek means "been equal", not being the "Macho Man",therefore Pual in know way is trying to be prejudice against women. He is just following God's order according to his plan and purpose for women.
S7a6pnmpaa	yo no la he visto pero se habla bastante del tema            'La llorona' es una mujer alta y estilizada cuyo atuendo es de color blanco, aunque no es posible distinguir sus rasgos faciales. Los relatos populares, la describen tambin como una mujer sin pies, en efecto, parece desplazarse por el piso sin rozarlo.   El mito de 'la llorona' afirma que su eterno penar se debe a que busca a un hijo recin nacido que asesin arrojndolo al ro para ocultar un pecado. Y en esta lnea, es parte de su penitencia, castigar a los muchachos que andan de amores prohibidos: se sube a sus caballos y puede llegar a matarlos en un helado abrazo mortal.     Se la llama 'la llorona' porque sus gemidos son tan insistentes que hasta enloquece a los perros, mientras deambula por las noches (sobre todo cuando es noche de plenilunio).     La mayora de los relatos, la consideran se?al de malos presagios, un indicador de mal agero: puede acercarse para enfermar a las personas, empeorar a los enfermos o traer desgracias a los seres queridos.     En otros relatos, 'la llorona' se presenta como un ser inofensivo que necesita consuelo y ayuda, despertando piedad en la gente que, cuando se acerca a consolarla, les roba todas sus pertenencias.|`|d12348809160a4ced93cf73a7f33c00eaa	Claro pero solo en las historias|`|8e6925bacca35b675dfb3d20e600d9c0aa	sy y cuidao te sale por la noche si la invocas. ni la menciones|`|L6lOKKuaaa	S... al menos creo que una amiga se podra ganar ese calificativo...

7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	There's a typo in what you wrote.  Here is the correct spelling:  Non je ne vais pas te dire, il faut attendre!  It means "No, I'm not going to tell you, it is necessary to wait."  Colloquially, it's better this way:  "No, I'm not going to tell you, you have to wait."    The other sentence, "quand tu reviens je vais le donner!" means:  "when you return I'm going to give it."   I've no idea to what "it" refers.|`|X6R8HlCqaa	no I am going to you not to say, it falsehood to wait!   and   when you come back I am going to give it!|`|uVFmP5kjaa	non je vais pas te dire, il faux attendre! - No, I'm not going to tell you, you have to wait.    quand tu reviens je vais le donner! - When you come back, I will give it.

It's just not worth it $$$$$. this is so easy money for the City/County/State and the CHP gets a cut of it, too.    Have fun with this one but be ready to write the check.

290fda62d7d2de71af663935803133d7aa	Mira Kelly, as como cualquier otro tipo de relaciones, depende exclusivamente de las personas que tienen la apertura suficiente de mente para aceptarlas o no.  sto no implica por supuesto que quien las acepte, necesariamente tenga que participar en ellas, yo mismo soy un ejemplo de eso.  Un famoso mdico norteamericano fallecido hace ya muchos a?os dijo que lo nico que era pervertido era lo que no se haca.  No se si realmente se refera a esta prctica sexual tambin, pero depende de cada uno si quiere integrarse o no a este medio.  Hace unos a?os atrs lea una nota muy interesante y extensa en la cual se entrevistaba a personas que participan en grupos swingers.  Ellos expresaban que no eran pervertidos y que ese tipo de relaciones no afectaba a la pareja, pues por lo general en esos grupos participan parejas con muchos a?os de relacin y que han probado todo tipo de relaciones sexuales.  En esos grupos, cuando estan organizados como la mayora de ellos, no se acepta a cualquier persona para participar, sino que antes de ser aceptados tienen que reunir una serie de condiciones que los hagan aptos para participar all.  Entre otras condiciones deben de ser personas casadas o que tengan una convivencia probada de varios a?os.  Esto para que no vayan dos personas que se conocieron dos das antes con solo intenciones de tener sexo con otras personas y nada ms.  Claro que existen personas que no se integran a esos grupos y se hacen llamar tambin swingers, pero para quienes con gran madurez han optado por ese tipo de relaciones es una afrenta que se llamen as, personas que no integran ningn grupo como ellos dicen.  Entre otras cosas los grupos organizados, se integran en un club, donde no solo existe el sexo, sino tambin existen relaciones sociales por parte de personas que fuera del tema sexual dicen ser muy cultas e importantes, al grado de que explicaban que de esas reuniones sociales han salido grandes negocios efectuados por empresarios que participan de esas practicas sexuales.  Para ms datos explicaban que preferan ese tipo de relacin a una donde existiera la infidelidad, por deseos de uno o de otro de pasar un momento sexual con otra persona, a escondidas de su pareja.  Visto desde este punto de vista, por supuesto que es preferible saber y participar a llevar un par de cuernos sin estar enterados de que los llevamos.  Creo que nadie tiene derecho a criticar a las personas que participan de estas relaciones swingers, as como tampoco criticar a los que prefieren los tros como sean estos o incluso no criticar a los que prefieren las orgas, donde se tienen relaciones mltiples.  Como dije, personalmente yo no participara en esas prcticas sexuales, pero las acepto para quien quiera participar en ellas.

pphnDuE1aa	If I'm understanding exactly what your meaning, I agree.    Years ago, a big bully followed me out of a bar. He confronted me. He was much bigger than I and kind of scary. He took his shirt off and started flexing his muscles, calling me every name in the book.    He asked if I wanted my butt kicked by him. I said, "No."    He said, "Then take off running". I said, "This is my neighborhood, I won't run from the likes of you".    He said, "Then get on your knees and suck my ****".    Instantly, I saw NO barriers in my way. I slugged him in the face. He fell on his back, I shoved two fingers in his eyes and pushed down with all my weight. This took all of about 3 seconds to complete. He screamed like a stuck pig.    So, am I understanding what you mean? That was my 'will'.

K is not silent but isn't very obvious either  K is pronounced together with sh. K is normal like in English but it's not followed by a vowel or semi vowel so you might find it difficult to pronounce.    Mind that sanskrit r is more trilling than English r.    it's like (k)shut-re-yuh    Btw Malay or Indonesian for Kshatriya is satria, some spell it sateria or kesateria, though it has changed meaning. It means knight, brave man, hero, warrior.

"we don't read any"  Who is the "we" you represent?   Have each and every one of  the "we" in this population agreed to be represented by you?    "any"  Does this mean "each and every", or "if and only if" the words you cite are explicitly mentioned?    How do you support your assertion?   Is there objective evidence that a rational person would conclude you are correct?  Are you basing your assertion on a personal belief system (your own presuppositions), that is, on "faith'?    My young skywalker, you appear to have shown up at a gunfight with only a knife in your hand. I recommend you review the following sites, carefully studying them, taking notes, etc., then return with some objective questions that I would be happy to answer for you.

That name and lifestyle that you use as an excuse for not abiding by God's truth, are in actuality God's ' ONLY PROVISION FOR FORGIVING SIN'S' AND 'THE ONLY WAY TO PLEASE HIM' (Hebrews 9:21-28; 11:6). You can continue that sinfully selfserving, selfdominating, selfrighteous nonsense if you want,    Revelation 20:10-15  " And the devil that decieved them (you might want to pay particular attention to this) was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.    And I saw a Great White Throne, and  him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was no place found for them.    And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.    And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.    And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the 'second death'.    And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.      That name and lifestyle that you use as an excuse for not abiding by God's truth, are in actuality God's ' ONLY PROVISION FOR FORGIVING SIN'S' AND 'THE ONLY WAY TO PLEASE HIM' (Hebrews 9:21-28; 11:6). You can continue that sinfully selfserving, selfdominating, selfrighteous nonsense if you want,    That name and lifestyle that you use as an excuse for not abiding by God's truth, are in actuality God's ' ONLY PROVISION FOR FORGIVING SIN'S' AND 'THE ONLY WAY TO PLEASE HIM' (Hebrews 9:21-28; 11:6). You can continue that sinfully selfserving, selfdominating, selfrighteous nonsense if you want, but the above should give you some indication that those that teach you (if anybody at all) don't respect God at all, no matter how much they say it. After all God brought to pass and all his dear Son went through, are you silly enough to actually think he is going to change the rules for you? God is 'immutable', he doesn't and cannot change. God and his Word are 'one' (John 1:1-5).

En la biologa, se considera vivo lo que tenga las caractersticas:    Organizacin: formado por clulas.   Reproduccin: capaz de reproducirse.   Desarrollo: capaz de crecer y hacerse ms complejo.   Adaptacin: capaz de evolucionar.   Energa: utiliza energa para mantener homeostasis.   Una entidad con las propiedades indicadas previamente se lo considera un organismo.    Definiciones de Vida     Fisiolgica:    Un organismo vivo es aquel, compuesto por materia orgnica (C,H,O,N,S,P), capaz de llevar a cabo funciones tales como comer, metabolizar, excretar, respirar, moverse, crecer, reproducirse y responder a estmulos externos.    Pero tales funciones no son del todo determinantes. Por ejemplo, ciertas bacterias quimiosintticas anaerobias estrictas no realizan la respiracin. Hoy en da esta definicin no se ajusta correctamente y, a pesar de su popularidad inicial, ha sido ya desechada.    Metablica:    Un sistema vivo es un objeto con una frontera definida que continuamente intercambia sustancias con el medio circundante sin alterarse.    Tambin ha sido rechazada por no poder incluir objetos vivos tales como las semillas, las esporas, o bacterias encapsuladas en estado de latencia. Y tambin por definir como vivos entidades tales como el fuego.    Bioqumica:    Todo organismo vivo contiene informacin hereditaria reproducible codificada en los cidos nucleicos los cuales controlan el metabolismo celular a travs de unas molculas (protenas) llamadas enzimas que catalizan o inhiben las diferentes reacciones biolgicas.    A pesar de ser ms precisa y acertada, tampoco se la considera una definicin vlida ya que excluye la vida fuera de la qumica que conocemos y, por ejemplo, la imposibilita en el campo ciberntico o en una qumica distinta; algo que, hasta ahora, no se ha demostrado.    Gentica:    La vida es todo sistema capaz de evolucionar por seleccin natural.    Una vez ms, tal definicin no es aceptada por muchos bilogos ya que incluye los virus dentro del grupo de los seres vivos y podra en un futuro introducir algn virus informtico polimrfico que incluyera algn tipo de rutina avanzada de evolucin darwiniana. Por supuesto nadie dira que tal programa de ordenador fuera un sistema vivo.    Termodinmica:    Los sistemas vivos son regiones localizadas donde se produce un continuo incremento de orden sin intervencin externa.    Esta definicin, quiz la mejor y ms completa, nace de la nueva y mejor comprensin del Universo que se ha tenido en este ltimo siglo. Se basa en el segundo principio de la termodinmica, el cual dice que la entropa o desorden, del universo siempre aumenta.    Esta poderosa ley de la fsica nos dice que la tendencia natural de todo objeto material es aumentar su entropa, la vida es un sistema que ira en contra de esa tendencia. De hecho, es considerada por muchos cientficos como un sistema fsico-qumico emergente extraordinariamente complejo. El aumento de orden en un sistema vivo no incumplira el citado principio termodinmico en forma global, ya que ello se hace siempre a expensas de un incremento de entropa en el Universo. As pues, la vida formara parte tambin de los llamados sistemas complejos.

Pet rocks require about a half gallon of water daily, but it must be enriched with the proper vitamins and minerals.  If you have no water, coolade may be substituted. Pet rocks like spaghetti, but they are allergic to carrots.  You may also feed your pet rock mud.  A pet rock needs alot of living space, so build it a little house, and take it on a walk at least every other day.  Keep it away from and rodents, or they will be eaten.  And never microwave your pet rock.  It doesn't like it.|`|kiS2wCuBaa	wow. lol that is all i have to say..dude you must be one bored man to even ask this question...in regards to the other person who said that rocks drink water if you put them into a fish tank it's called evaporation.  anyway back to you...haha i'm sorry i just can't take this seriously. cute question though.|`|57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	Yes that is why in Oregon they are rounded up and put in rock cribs for fencing material.

Yet, there are certain individuals with powers that could be termed "super" like shamen in Africa who can double themselves and be at two places at one.

No evidence essentially means that someone made it up.  It is not reasonable to believe in things without any evidence.  You would be stuck with every  ridiculous thing that human imagination could come up with.    Not believing in god is the same as not believing in Zeus, Odin, Santa, Anubis, the Tooth Faerie, and all the thousands of others since the evidence is exactly the same.  I would be no less surprised if someone found evidence of Bacchus than I would be if they found evidence of your god.|`|wix9GNMcaa	Are you talking about communion?

97df24e660c753726da91950f8e97491aa	Dreams    Flowers    Most of the times dreams of flowers are reassuring. In real life, few people do not associate flowers with pleasure and relaxation. Apart from simply enjoying them, we use flowers as gestures of love, reassurance, comfort, and sympathy. It is generally in one or other of the contexts that flowers of all kinds frequently appear in our dreams. Certain types of flower have individual associations for particular dreamers; if the emphasis in your dream seems to be on one particular type, try to recognize any possible connections. Some flowers also have traditional significance.     Bouquet   Try to identify the other person in the dream to whom you are sending or presenting the bouquet to. It may be someone you respect, love, or have compassion for; someone who you wished loved or respected you; or someone who has more regard for you than you may consciously believe. A dream of giving flowers to an anonymous or of receiving them from someone you cannot identify, may suggest that your self-respect is in need of encouragement.    Wreath of Flowers  A dream of sending someone a wreath of flowers could certainly be associated with unconscious feelings of guilt and hostility, but not with the same strength as dream of attacking, or being attacked by, the person with whom the dream is associated. It is more likely to be a gesture of sympathy evoked by a conscious or unconscious understanding that the recipient has lost or lacks some quality. Have they lost your friendship? Dreaming of receiving a wreath may have the same significance: who sent the wreath? Could it be someone with whom you have recently lost sympathy or quarreled? The appearance of the flowers in your dream may be significant: if they were formally arranged (perhaps you were arranging them) there might be a suggestion that your social life is too carefully organized; or perhaps needs putting in order.     Flowers in the garden  Flowers in a garden, or strewn around your home, would seem to suggest that your life is full of pleasure. But what else was happening in the dream? Were you tidying the flowers, or were you scattering more around? A dream in which flowers predominate in a garden may suggest (unless you are a passionate flower-grower) that your life needs more color, and that you should be less preoccupied merely with the practical business of making a living.     Dead Flowers  A dream of dead flowers is often depressing, and may convey a message of regret or danger. The destruction of flowers (attacked perhaps by a worm or grub) contains a similarly ominous tone.    Watering and feeding flowers  If you were watering or feeding flowers, there may be a hint that you need to work on a relationship. Flowers in bud, or blossoming, in dreams may symbolize the flowering of an idea or a new relationship; or that you are entering a new phase in your life. Freud considers flowers to be a female symbol, because of their cup-shaped blossoms and because a bee enters them in order to fertilize them. In male dreams, a flower can represent women or a particular woman. The flower could also symbolize an idea that has been fertilized in your mind.      Wild Flowers  Wild flowers emphasize natural qualities, relaxed beauty, and scorn for the highly organized artificiality of flowerbeds. The latter, with the blooms carefully placed, may seem impressive rather than endearing, suggesting the cautious organization of talent rather than its full flowering.       Cut Flowers  Cut flowers are displayed rather than allowed to give pleasure in their natural setting: they may be symbols of artificiality.    Particular Flower  The Rose, for example, has been a symbol not only of love but also of courage: were the roses in your dream thorny? The buttercup is traditionally associated with childhood; the orchid with beauty, admiration, and wealth; the camellia with delicacy; and the lily with being elegant, cool, and remote.  Gardening    If you were gardening, however, creativity is probably indicated: the dream may be referring to your psychological growth, or increasing emotional or financial security.|`|WEEJieyIaa	That means you are pregnant! Pregnant women tend to dream of tiny creatures, fuzzy animals, flowers, fruit and water.|`|af87394ef4e3013ab95d9d093f2c9b51aa	nasty dream.      don't want to think about it.|`|f83bcda2a7df13f1ff3acb55292045e4aa	It means you like flowers or were thinking about them before falling asleep.|`|AA10781920	Flower the Skunk?

It is also symbolic of perfection and spirituality. Your dream may be an expression of love, joy and happiness. Alternatively, flowers may denote a particular time or season. If the flowers are white, then it? symbolizes sadness.    To see withered or dead flowers in your dream, denotes disappointments and gloomy situations. You may not be utilizing your full potential and talents.    To dream that you receive a bouquet of flowers, represents respect, approval, admiration, and rewards.    To see flowers blooming in barren soil, signifies that energy and cheerful nature will enable you to overcome your grievances.        Sunflower  To see a sunflower in your dream, symbolizes warmth, abundance, longevity, and prosperity. The sunflower also serves to point you in the right direction and is a source of spiritual guidance. Even through difficult times, you will persevere. Alternatively, the sunflower may denote haughtiness. You may be deceived by the false appearance of others.        Cauliflower  To see or eat cauliflower in your dream, symbolizes spiritual nourishment, purity and perfection. It also represents sadness and need to be uplifted. You dream? indicates that the tough times that you are experiencing will soon be over. Alternatively, the cauliflower represents the brain.|`|FjhqrybTaa	hi,     this is manjunath,the answr for this question is,     if we dream about flowers then we have two resions.they are.  1.the first one is u r thinking about girl  2.and the second one is writing poem on flower.

Also, may I say that you might be interpreting his normal actions and words a flirting because you WANT him to be flirting. And not to be stereotypical but a lot of gay guys are really charming. I don't think you really have a chance dear.    I know it sucks, but there are other men to go chasing after, and  plenty of them are into women :)|`|AA10146367	He could be saying he's gay just to get you away from him.  In all honesty.

If he is really gay then your just gonna have to learn to deal, its not really a "change back" or "choice" kind of thing, you should still be friends with him though, that way he'll keep a good friend and you'll be able to spend as much time with him as you can.    unfortunately honey, this isn't one of those "it's not you its me" situations, the fact is that it actually is you! there's nothing you can do about it and it's not that he doesn't want to be around you, he just doesn't fall in love with girls!
ee7be4740f26d924965c0f3c4f5fae82aa	We will never all just get along. The problem here is that it's human nature to be comptetitive and many people like to pretend they are better than others for no real reason at all. Everybody is a little bit prejudiced, most people just deny it. Also a huge amount of people are just plain stupid and you have to learn to ignore them.|`|3e86b5d72c9fbe34177e11d0c2db2089aa	I have to agree with Flinch. Stereotypes exist but they are outdated.

A comment may be ignorant to you, but a real feeling from someone's experience. Just roll your eyes and move on. There is nothing you can do to change a fool. NOTHING!|`|qNcSZiKNaa	People in our country make rude assumptions.  They think that if something isn't the way that they do it, it is bad, so they try to act as if they are perfect even though they are doing terrible things.  For example, many people who go to church think that they are amazing people who can never do anything wrong on Sundays, but the rest of the week they are rude, terrible, people.  They just say these things like "they aren't prejudice" to make themselves feel good, but when they aren't around those who are bothered by their ignorant comments they once again become their rude selves.|`|9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	A lot of people seem to think of prejudice as only a white people vs black people thing.  They don't think of it as encompassing multiple boundaries, like ethnicity, gender, groups, etc.  Plus, a lot of people are bad about stereotyping, even though a lot of them don't realize it.|`|3f2ecb650983d8145ed381f1145f391faa	Well honey sorry to upset your philosophy but philipono women do the same thing to Australian Men until our government put a stop on it .Most married and left within 2 years ,some were treated badly by us Aussies a sad fact but true I have met some that have made it successfully here "ie"married a long time working and happy .You should however be proud of your heratige but still consider yourself American which you are regardless of skin color .LoL.john h.|`|9ad86643bed620a483f30b4cc1852732aa	I'm feeling ya, but don't confuse opinions for ignorance.

The strength is in the grammar  "some of the main cause..."  it should be "causes", and since only two things are mentioned, it is better to say "two of the main causes" than "some of the main causes".  Usually, "some" is used when three or more elements are involved.|`|2208c2dae4b48648f8b95f21a760a999aa	I think those are THE cause.

And there are things that make it really hard to fight when all of it is there like I broke my back and ruptured 2 disks in my neck. So I'm very inactive and bored and my mom was over weight and right after I was hurt I had to have a hysterectomy at age 21. So I got FATTER and more disabled etc. etc. Now I have lost 50 lbs and have started getting better. My D.N.A. and hormones have not changed but my diet and eating habits are getting better. THANX

La mente es poderosa, no permitas entrar pensamientos negativos.  El hecho de q hayas fracasado en algunas carreras no te hace una fracasada.  No dejes q la negatividad mande en tu mente.  Otra cosa importante es declarar con tu boca, que obtendrs la victoria.  Yo pensaba q no era necesario esto, pero lo he aplicado a mi vida, y es una realidad, di con tu boca lo que quieres, y no digas cosas negativas, y veras cambio en tu mente y forma de actuar.  Para mi fue dificil y todavia lo es pero, si tienes fe, veras cambios.    Asi q te recomiendo q le ores a Dios, pidiendo direccin y mientras oras, actes.  Pregntate, en donde te visualisas trabajando, q te apasiona?   No importa si es una carrera q ya sientes q hayas intentado o no.  Si te apasiona y te gusta, entonces intntalo.  Y mientras ests en ella, persevera.  Cuando te sientas q no puedes mas, no mires todo el trayecto, mira un dia a la vez.  Hoy le pido a Dios q me ayude con este dia, y sigue asi, hasta q lo logres.  Eso es lo q hago cuando siento q no tengo fuerzas para seguir mis estudios, le pido fuerzas a Dios por el dia de hoy, todo los dias.  Te deseo mucho exito en la carrera q elijas, piensa positivo, dejale tus cargas en manos de Dios, y veras como lo lograras.  No pierdas tu fe.  DTBM|`|9bdf33f7ea8b3fed0730c90f12767ba0aa	AMIGA!!!

I could defend the entire teenage population, but that would be lying.  I am not emotionally attached to my cell phone, and in fact, rarely use it.  Unfortunately, that's not the case for most of the people I know.    Of course, cell phones are off limits during school, but it's not uncommon to see kids texting under the desk or behind their purse.  I just want to ask, "Who can you possibly be texting?  Everyone you know is in school right now!"  And then, the end bell rings and all through the halls, kids are stepping out of classrooms with cell phones already attached to their ears.   It's kind of sick actually.    I think that kids only need cell phones once they start driving.  I believe that if a teen is responsible enough to drive, they are responsible enough to have a cell phone.  However, that brings up a whole new issue about how too many irresponsible kids are allowed to drive.  But, that's another topic.    I do believe that it has become an obsession.  It's all about what kind of phone you have, what does it do, and which cell phone plan you have.  If you want to be "cool" you have to have the latest phone with unlimited texting and nearly unlimited minutes too.  I have friends who will turn around and go back home to get their phone if they leave it, even if they are already in the parking lot at school and the tardy bell is about to ring in just five minutes.  They can't live without it.  It's insane.    Yes, it most certainly is detrimental to face to face communication.  Teens now-a-days really don't know how to have intelligent conversations with other people.  It's like, if a phone isn't against their ear, they go brain dead or something.    Sorry if what I'm saying doesn't make much sense, but being a teen myself, I see it EVERY day.|`|19ffee8a128364f92292c25507a2faa1aa	it can be good and bad  good when you need to get in trouch with your children  bad then they go over the minutes  bad when they think it replaces the house phone  bad when they think they need to have the most expensive cell phone to fit in  bad when they dont appreciate it and drop it  bad when they buy things such as ringtones,wallpapers,games etc. without asking permission  and yes it is an obsession for most teens  so i think it has a positive effect..but more negative effects than positive|`|5TTaW3Msaa	Like so many things, cell phone use can be beneficial or detrimental.

2577f0992ce02aa0bade7b777b040d17aa	Lets look at the components of your dream first:     1. Lad=young person or a new situation, a new issue and so on.  2.Holding hands=Something you accept, something true and lasting, something that holds up, also holding hands could be a show of love.    3. Failing asleep with head on his shoulders=denotes trust on your part and support of other person (s) involved.    4. Dream within a dream=although the situation is real and clear, you need to sleep on the issue before making any decision.    You may like a person, or a current situation in your life, and it may appear to be good and lasting but it is not, it is bound to change into a new situation you may not fancy, thus it is advisable to postpone any major decisions in your life, at least for a while.    Your dream advices you to sleep on it, so please meditate, day-dream, or lucid dream before you finalize the message, or connect this dream with a new dream (s) yet to come.  Thank you for sharing your dream.|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	It's actually quite easy to interpret.  You like both these boys but in different ways.  You probably favor one when it comes to having lunch and the other with hanging out...or something like that.  I hope you know what I mean.  It just basically means that you have conflicting emotions about who to date.|`|4f83b50bc7a24c965d2217c8fbf221ecaa	It means your lonely|`|68fd562bcc726b3ad41ca79d43597ce4aa	No one can tell you what things mean in *your* dreams without knowing what each thing means to *you*. Dreams are what we experience while the brain processes various thought, events, etc during sleep. We can't say, "Oh, dreaming of fish means someone's having a baby" because you have no idea what fish means to the person. If I'm allergic to fish in real life, the dream meaning of the fish is different than from the person who absolutely loves fish.  You have to think about how "you" feel about the subject. And even that might not help since sometimes the brain symbolizes thoughts with unexpected things! The best advice I have is to read about "lucid dreaming." This is being awake while you're asleep. It's very easy to do (with practice) but you'll be able to recognize what you're dreaming about and what thoughts to which they are connected.  Dreams are not understood, because most people can't think rationally during a dream. By lucid dreaming, you'll be able to. For instance, a personal anecdote, I was thinking about exercising and improving my health when I began a new program. The dream manifested itself as a rhino running on an uncompleted highway. I was the rhino (determined, strong) running (exercising/going forward/making progress) on a new highway (program).  Look up "lucid dreaming" and really do the exercises if you want to discover how your brain interprets thoughts. It's really easy and fun.|`|aub4VI7aaa	It shows two things... First that you like the first boy, therefore your mind projected that scene as a materialization of a desire, an as for the second scene that merely shows that you KNOW the other guy likes you....obvious|`|8uzXMrkFaa	bed both of them, then see who makes you crazy.  That's the guy.  but you should already know who you want, but your still not believing yourself.  The dream about both of them is about your secret desires, your sub-conscious come out in your dreams.|`|WMKASAHmaa	I have been in this situation before. As someone said earlier, we can't really know what to say unless we know what is going on in your life. But,  it seems like you like the first boy and know it, and like the second boy as a best friend, maybe more. Think about this, do you know if your best guy friend likes you? Or, have you told your crush you like him... These could all be factors in your dream|`|Qblpm2viaa	the only person who can interpret your dreams is yourself.

En la actualidad hay lideres espirituales que han empezado a hacer procelitismo gay o apologa del homosexualismo y no saben el da?o que hacen.    Por otro lado el mundo gay es un mundo triste, lleno de personas a quienes no vez plenamente feliz que al llegar la noche se refugian en una soledad disfrazada con luces de neon, que puede ser infinita, tan infinita como su desequilibrio emocional y energtico.    Si te involucras con una persona gay en ese nivel, te invadir su energa desequilibrada por decadas o por toda tu vida y eso va ms all de que creas en alguna corriente espiritual o no, es a nivel energtico y podras terminar da?ado.    Hace un tiempo un chico me pregunt como dejar de ser gay, es obvio que prob y no le aport felicidad a su vida. Si, si se puede, primero alejate de cualquier influencia gay, peliculas, amigos fiestas, libros,etc.    Hay muchas que muestran a los gays en una suerte de fiesta interminable de placer, la realidad la pueden ver en pelculas como Back Brock Mountain.    Primero empieza en pensar en ti, como individuo y en la manera de ser feliz no a travs de otras personas si no gracias a ti. Haz una lista de lo que ms te gustara hacer y opta por aquellas que no tengan nada que ver con lo gay, conciertos, deportes, lectura, etc. tienes un infinito de posibilidades.

Si quieres salir hazlo cuando creas q estes preparado, no te precipites; y si decides no comentarselo a tus padres (q esto no quiere decir q no puedas llevar una vida sentimental coherente a tus tendencias, sino simplemente q ellos no se enteren). aunq creo, q tarde o temprano, tus padres te aceptarian, pq eres asi y tienes q estar orgulloso de ser simplemente tu mismo. Seguiras siendo un hijo tan querido, un buen amigo de tus amigos, seguiras teniendo tus mismos defectos y virtudes, seguiras siendo la misma persona; independientemente de tu orientacion sexual. lo importante es querer, quererse, ser querido y ser feliz. animo!y piensa q hagas lo q hagas estara bien.|`|756fbc82fb4b53792963aa3a1ca99826aa	Si, porque si no o haces, estas viviendo en una mentira, y eso no es vida.|`|b3c77941249689475d72ef95c903893caa	realmente puedes tener todo o no tener nada pero ser tu mismo yo creo que tiene mas valor ademas realmente eres feliz no cres que te tienes que armar de valor y enfrentar una realidad que tarde o temprano tendras que enfrentar suerte|`|5627b0b7a0e30423288005ead82f73b9aa	si crees que por eso dejaran de apoyarte no les digas, busca el momento oportuno, cuando seas independiente y el dolor no sea tan duro|`|6806e17ba035f58334548ebbadef4ff4aa	se dice armario|`|66b9f0316705a0896b98870b5fdb65bbaa	T qu quieres hacer?

Eu particularmente n?o concordo com esse pensamento pq eu acredito que  mais vlido vc se proteger de uma doen?a que pode te matar e matar as pessoas do que se preocupar se as coisas v?o seguir seu curso natural e mesmo pq, de acordo com esse raciocinio da igreja, o estupro n?o  algo t?o ediondo, pois apesar de um lado estar sendo violentado, o prazer de quem esta estuprando pode gerar uma nova vida ( e isso eu ouvi de um padre que tb naum concordava com esse pensamento da igreja )|`|b9c86ee799ee9289d28781eef32ea0dbaa	ahahahahahahahahahahah.|`|b0fcbc37afe51d8e08cb53a9ceb4600baa	leia as escrituras.  ver  fcil, entender tambm, acreditar  uma quest?o pessoal, seguir a doutrina que  a mesma.....somente quem tem coragem de encarar o mundo.|`|88b9b09d8c73f313b9241828853def37aa	por ela n?o tem o que fazer.|`|bd904f130230ea47146af9e5e61723d7aa	A Igreja sempre defendeu os princpios ensinados por Cristo. E continua defendendo-os at hoje, mesmo atacada e sem ceder aos modismos e desvios de comportamento por parte das sociedades com o passar dos tempos.  bem verdade que naquela poca n?o existia a camisinha, mas j existiam os excessos, o pecado.  Entende-se que quem ama n?o tem necessidade utilizar o outro, n?o o torna seu objeto de seu prazer, o que  prprio da camisinha.  o sexo descompromissado, livre, que veio com a revolu??o sexual. E a Igreja defende o amor, o amor-compromisso, la?o afetivo, que pregou Cristo. Porm n?o s?o todas as pessoas que concordam com isto, pois vem apenas os prprios interesses e imediatismos. E por conta disto  que h esta incompreens?o.|`|175bb29af19a23e80f1f3d391c7d89e8aa	Ah, eu acho que a igreja, nos primrdios, acreditava em algum simbolismo para o esperma, e hoje os novos padres nem sabem muito bem o verdadeiro significado dessa "diretriz", mas a seguem e a ilustram com ilus?es para afastar mentes que n?o est?o prontas para a verdade.

E os preservativos facilitam isso.Hoje n?o existe mas o medo mrbido de doen?as sexualmente transmissveis (resultado de rela??es sexuais com parceiros multiplos e levianos).Basta colocar a camisinha ou outro preservativo e pronto!... foi-se o problema.A Bblia condena sexo fora do vnculo marital.Eu particularmente concordo com ela.E esque?a esta conversa de que "Deus s quer que fa?amos sexo pra procriar". N?O!!Jamais. H provas biblicas de que Deus quer sim que sintamos prazer e mostremos no ato sexual o quanto amamos o nosso conjuge, mas s depois do casamento.|`|c2ff3678dde798e9abbcd246d14774c8aa	Depende da igreja.

Like when the Anti Christ show himself to ever one on this earth. A lot of good people will die, but some good people will live and tell the story about it. And who ever has faith and pray to Christ those people shall be the first to live again. Because God always puts he's peoples first. The people that worship him and then the secondary people that live a descent not so wicked life second. But like I said the people who served God shall come alive first, because they served the Master. It like if you love your mother and if she does allot of things for you. You would always think of Her before family. Because she do stuff for you and also gave you life. It just like who ever do something for the Master, God will never forget them of their kindness. And he doesn't put no one before his people. he doesn't put them second, third or fourth. I hopes this answer your question.

Christian is a follower of Jesus, whom they regard as a/the Christ. Most Christians believe Jesus to be the Son of God, who lived a life befitting that of the creator of the universe, free of sin, and at the end of his earthly life was crucified, and then on the third day after death rose from the dead, to give the message to his followers.

53483ad757d876eaab00e045bfdd7f54aa	In Old English, a paell was a rich cloth, especially purple cloth as worn by royalty.  In fact, pall meant "purple" in Old English.  The word was also taken by the ecclesiastical community to refer to an altar cloth, or the cloth with which the chalice was covered.  By the 15th century, pall was being used to describe a cloth that covered a coffin, hearse, or tomb.  Then, by the mid-18th century, we find the term pallbearer, which originally referred to those who held the corners of the pall cloth at a funeral.  Eventually, those who carried the coffin itself came to be known as the pallbearers, by association.      Pall also has the familiar meaning of "dark, gloomy covering or mood", which is simply a figurative usage that dates from the mid-18th century.  A less familiar meaning was "cloak or mantle", and there is even a specific vestment worn by the Pope called a pall.    The Old English form derives from Latin pallium "coverlet, curtain, cloak, the philosphers' cloak".|`|AA10160243	Its Pall Bearer.|`|AA11110297	Pallbearer is a funeral paranymph, helping when the casket of a deceased person is carried away from a religious service or viewing to their final resting place, or to and from the hearse which does so.    A pall is the heavy cloth that is draped over a coffin; by metonymy the term pallbearer is used to signify someone who bears the coffin which the pall covers.

08aff06b575422a59fc504fe87f3471baa	Es cuestin de leer un poco ms... Si la velocidad de la luz es de 300.000 kilmetros por segundo... Y la distancia de una estrella es no menor a millones de a?os a la velocidad de la luz... piensa lo siguiente...  Si para llegar a la Tierra la luz tiene que viajar a su velocidad por millones de a?os... Seguramente ests observando en el cielo, muchas estrellas que ya se han apagado. Te llegan imgenes que son, literalmente, del pasado.|`|83f9afdc83583fe361eb30e86ea2986caa	es verdad lo que decs, es mas, tal vez en otra galaxia nuestro sol todava no all sido visto y por so tal vez no nos conozcan otras especies pensantes. Ya que mencionas la teora de espacio-tiempo tambin nuestro sol all dejado de verse tambin por el simple motivo de que ha dejado de existir. Es una teora amplia de discusin, pero es real, nosotros para otros seres ya pudimos haber desaparecido hace miles de millones de a?os, es raro pero es la verdad segn la teora.|`|09c611ff2675d0ff7a9728b0206b6d35aa	Si, es cierto, puede ser que casi todo el universo ya alla desaparecido y nos enteraremos en algunos millones de a?os de eso.|`|e2f657954c7d4dd1586771a7714d9ebdaa	La mayora de las estrellas que vemos en el cielo, ya no existen:  Es cierto...La luz del Sol llega a nuestro planeta a los ocho minutos...del mismo modo, la luz de las estrellas por la mayor distancia a recorrer habrn de tardarse un poco ms, digamos unos cuatro a?os, que es el de la distancia de la ms cercana...Por ello, al ver el firmamento, vemos el pasado...la luz que percibimos como luceros, es el de un rayo de luz que comenz a viajar hacia nosotros hace un muy largo tiempo...|`|AA10302841	No. Es cierto que la luz que percibimos viene desde muy lejos, entonces ha tardado en llegar hasta nuestros ojos, pero no significa que las estrellas hayan dejado de existir. La vida de una estrella es ms larga que el tiempo que tarda en llegar la luz.|`|AA11470154	No creo q sean la mayora, ya q las estrellas (dependiendo de q clase de estrella es) brillan por muchsimo millones de a?os.  Pero muchas si han podido dejar de existir, ya q la  luz viaja a determinada velocidad y dependiendo la distancia en q estn dichas estrellas, puede ser q veamos estrellas como ellas existan, 300 a?os atrs, otras 1000 a?os atrs.  Todo depende de la distancia entre las estrella.  Es como mira al pasado, ya q las estrellas las vez hoy como ellas eran hace cientos de a?os!  El tiempo no es una teora es una dimensin, largo, ancho, volumen/espacio y tiempo.  Pero se suponen q hay otras dimensiones q no hemos descubierto aun.|`|342ed5dd12fcf19f831be8ef6f574c27aa	si s que es cierto pero noson todas son la mayora, el porque, pues porque como hemos oido muchas veces, hay estrellas que stan de nosotros a a?os luz, eso quiere decir que para que nos llegue la luz de una estrella tiene que pasar millones de a?os y cuando nos llega la luz esa estralla hace alomejor 50 a?os que ya no existe y ya esta apagada, otras estrellas sin embargo en el momento en que esta brillando la estamos viendo, espero que lo hayas entendido besos|`|3374b5891db31e0e92f5311512241936aa	Que lindo apodo, pollita, pollita, pollita.|`|1a203fd7a0c3268865f5124709276178aa	Claro!!  La luz de las estrellas, como estn tan lejos de nosotros, su luz tarda aproximadamente 3 a?os en llegar a la tierra, en ese tiempo, bien pudieron haber "muerto" ya,  cesado de emitir luz, a ver, un ejemplo:    Hoy Lunes 17 de Julio del 2006 en la noche sales a ver las estrellas, y la luz que vas a observar va a ser la luz que emitieron alrededor del da  17 de Julio del 2003, pero como tarda 3 a?os en llegar, apenas la ests viendo.    Ahora bien, ese da 17 de Julio de 2003 una estrella "muir" ?oK? ya no emite luz, pero t, ese mismo da la seguiste viendo, xq viste la luz que emiti hace 3 a?os.. el da de hoy puede que veas su luz, xq dur un poco ms en llegar, pero tal vez ma?ana ya no la veas.. O sea, la estrella muri hace 3 a?os, pero t apenas te ests percatando de eso xq ya no vez la luz que nos llegaba.    No sucede lo mismo con el sol, pues es la estrella ms cercana que tenemos, la luz del sol creo que tarda unos cuantos minutos en llegar a la tierra, pero s, algunas estrellas que ves en el firmamento ya no existen, slo es la luz que apenas nos est llegando, exactamente lo que dices: la luz del "pasado" pues esa luz fue emitida en una fecha, pero dada la distancia que nos separa, tarda en viajar y llegar hasta nosotros, as que la luz de las estrellas que siempre vemos en el cielo nocturno fue emitida 3 a?os atrs.|`|537ed592dc445aca76f41111254ba490aa	El decir que la mayoria ya no existen seria algo aventurado, pero si podriamos decir que algunas de las estrellas que vemos en el firmamento ya no estan ahi. Esto debido a la distancia que nos separa de ellas, en muchos casos de millones de a?os luz. Por ejemplo supongamos que nuestro sol deja de brillar, se apagara por asi decirlo, a nosotros nos tomaria 8 minutos darnos cuenta que ya no esta ahi. En realidad ver el cielo es ver el pasado, incluyendo a nuestro propio sol pues estamos a poco mas de 8 minutos luz de distancia de el, y la mayoria de las estrellas estan a varios a?os de distancia, asi que dificilmente veriamos las estrellas en tiempo real, pero esto no quiere decir q la mayoria no existe. Nuestro sol tiene millones de a?os brillando y es una estrella joven, hay muchas estrellas en el firmamento mas jovenes que nuestro sol y otras mas antiguas que el. Lo que si es correcto decir es "lo que vemos es el pasado".|`|7b6441d25aa11d677282a383cca9a133aa	Mi hermana me conto eso cuando era ni?o, bueno, segun la velocidad de la luz y la distancia que tenga la estrella, entonces, puede ser totalmente cierto.|`|c0d94ddb02543c37d07ac0e9b24c61dcaa	Es cierto, aunque la mayoria aun existe. Muchas de ellas dejaron de existir hace tiempo pero estan tan lejos que su luz aun nos llega. Por ejemplo, si una estrella ubicada a un millon de a?os luz explotara ahora mismo, su luz continuara llegando hasta aca justo hasta dentro de un millon de a?os.

AA11110297	In 1543 the geocentric system met its first serious challenge with the publication of Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, which posited that the Earth and the other planets instead revolved around the Sun. The geocentric system was still held for many years afterwards, as at the time the Copernican system did not offer better predictions than the geocentric system, and it posed problems for both natural philosophy and scripture.    With the invention of the telescope in 1609, observations made primarily by Galileo (such as that Jupiter has moons) called into question some of the tenets of geocentrism but did not seriously threaten it.        The seven parts of Copernicus' theory are:  1. There is no one center in the universe     2. The Earth's center is not the center of the universe     3. The center of the universe is near the sun     4. The distance from the Earth to the sun is imperceptible compared with the distance to the stars     5. The rotation of the Earth accounts for the apparent daily rotation of the stars     6. The apparent annual cycle of movements of the sun is caused by the Earth revolving around the sun     7. The apparent retrograde motion of the planets is caused by the motion of the Earth, from which one observes|`|8c22564a3024e14250e563d12f37772daa	Where in the Bible does it say that the Earth is the center of the solar system?|`|AA12324486	This is such an obvious point and I still am amazed that there are so many people who believe you can take the Bible completly literally and that it is inerrant. To the person who says where in the Bible does it state the solar system is geocentric, see the website below where some poor misguided soul is still trying to convince people the heliocentric solar system is false based on scripture. Scripture aside from just being plain wrong scientifically is also often fuzzy to its meaning and even sometimes contradictory so you end up with a variety of people and faith arriving at very different interpretations.|`|76fab5a346533146055f8012006fe272aa	Cause of One word, 'politics'|`|AA10798322	Galileo was not persecuted because of his heliocentric theories.      In fact, he wasn't persecuted at all.    He was simply asked by the Church to prove his theories first -- something he had not done -- before teaching them as fact.      That's not too much for anything, including science, to ask.    I'm afraid there is a LOT of misinformation out there about Galileo and his relationship with the Church.       The Church was actually very interested in Galileo's theories.   They were not interested in his teaching them as fact before he had proven them, though.

El hombre est dotado con msculos ms potentes y desarrollados, lo que le permite tener ms fuerza para esfuerzos fsicos como levantar pesos o saltar alto.    No obstante, ello no implica superioridad general del hombre sobre la mujer, pues la mujer tiene otras capacidades en las que supera ampliamente al hombre.    A nivel intelectual no hay superioridad de ningn sexo pese a que los procedimientos de raciocinio pueden diferir: usualmente se considera a la mujer ms intuitiva y  al hombre ms analtico.  Pero no est claro si dicha diferencia puede haber sido influida por razones culturales ms que genticas.    En toda sociedad sana debe haber un equilibrio de las fortalezas masculinas y femeninas a todo nivel, pues se complementan y se potencian, y de esa manera se alcanza una mayor plenitud de la sociedad, llmese familia, empresa o nacin.    En el siglo XX y lo poco que llevamos del XXI hemos visto como las mujeres acceden a diferentes esferas o campos que tradicionalmente le estaban vedados.  Y viceversa, hay reas que han empezado a ser desempe?ados por hombres, de nuevo con resultados extraordinarios.  En ambos casos, tanto hombres como mujeres han hecho importantes aportes y han generado avances que quizs no se hubieran dado si se hubiese continuado con la tradicional distribucin sexista de cargos.      Es as como todos, directa o indirectamente, nos hemos visto beneficiados por los aportes de las mujeres a la poltica, el gobierno, las artes en general, la creacin intelectual, etc.  Y similarmente, ha sido benfico ver a hombres dar sus aportes a la moda, el dise?o, la cocina y otras reas tradiciolmente, desempe?adas por mujeres, incluyendo el quedarse en casa para cuidar los hijos mientras la esposa va a trabajar a la oficina.|`|c611996fa4009072238bb88c4aaade2eaa	la mujer , alguien dijo una vez que una mujer  necesitaba un transplante de corazon, le  hicieron pero le pusieron un corazon de hombre y cuando fue a dar a luz no resistio su corazon y murio.....|`|f1cc36201c0bce125b9925fcd7c43cdfaa	El hombre es ms fuerte por la capacidad musculara que tiene y por la testosterona.

It's very non-specific, for a start. Everyone is coloured. The only non-coloured people would be transparent, and I don't know any transparent people.    Secondly, it's just something that's outdated, like *****.     For me, being mixed, it leaves a particularly sour taste in my mouth, because it was the term used under apartheid in S. Africa to denote someone who was of mixed blood, and thus to determine their social standing and civil liberties. I don't like any term that has connotations with apartheid.|`|a0218134f588f35d65fefc5c00cac272aa	yes i mind! it is somewhat like discrimination, i hate they call my boyfriend "black guy"|`|AA12144053	No, it doesn't bother me knowing I'm not my body anyway, I am only using this body for the experience.|`|AA12084255	I've never been called colored.

The son probably helped out at home before moving back in with you.  He may have a job, but he can do a load of laundry every night, and still be there for his wife and children. . . How much can the wife do? ? Even though ill, she would probably love to help, even if you took laundry to her to fold, and you put away. . . she would feel good being able to help just that little bit. . . Have the son make sure the childrens rooms are clean and toys picked up. He should be handing them chores to do, and enforcing them. The teenager should pitch in where ever he is needed. He probably even has friends over. . .where is the daughter?  She may have pitched her son out, but that does not relieve her of responsibilities. . . call her on the carpet with all the older ones and tell them how you feel ! !

On a day when everyone is home, order a house cleaning.

I want to move to a better and easier place to live in and take care of.  My husband is still working and is likely to continue working.  We are both in our mid-60's.  I retired last year, and am ready to move on. I have even had a couple of real estate agents in to tell us what we need to do to get the house ready to sell.  We are even downsizing. We have even looked at places to move to. None of this seems to matter to him.   My solution to this dilemma is to continue on as if we were going to move, and sooner or later, I hope, he will come to realize that he can't go on forever the way he is doing.  Our children are on my side and he is outnumbered in that respect.  I sympathize with you.  It is a very disconcerting and difficult situation to be in.  I'm so glad you asked this question. About time someone did.  I thought I was the only one in this situation.    Edit. Our children live far away in other states in other parts of the country, so we are alone here. When they come to visit they can only give so much help.

But then, she retired, and did not want to spend the money to join the Seniors Club, even tho my sister in law wanted to pay the dues for her.  So, Mamma sat in her chair, knitting and watching TV.  She went downhill rapidly, and did not live very long after that.    So, I learned that you have to get out of your house, be around other people, enjoy your life.  There isn't a Senior Club in my town, so I don't do that. But, there is a ceramics class, and I go to that.  And there are lots of activities at church.  I go, and I do things.

She said worrying was a big waste of time and will beat you down like no other.  "Worry when you have too ... don't worry about worrying"  She was such a strong women and this must have been why.

My parents always yelled at me "why don't you grow up!"  So, no wonder I'm confused.  I always thought I'd get older but just not act old or think old for as long as possible--which is why it always surprises me when some young whppersnapper reminds me [to him/her] I am old.  I don't feel old, except my body is no longer my more reliable friend.  I'm still pretty determined to have fun--fun by my own standards not someone else's.  But the times we live in are making me feel old and giving me fears that old people have--which I kind of resent cause I'm having to change a lot of goals and the way I live right now and how I anticipate to live in the future--not drastically but enough to mess up a lot of wild dreams.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	elders not much -  i joined the service right out of school so my teachers were the military!!!|`|GkH5NoFyaa	My immediate elders only taught me about how bad life was for them (depression, unemployment, low income, etc, etc.). Funny though, all my life living at home I heard about how poor we were. Then when I grew up and got married, they bought a condo on the ocean!    Other elders, such as Jack LaLanne, taught me that if I exercise every day, I will grow up feeling healthy and happy. No matter what happens in my life.    23 years of weightlifting, aerobics, stretching, proper eating, I am stronger, bigger, healthier, and happier than most people on this planet.    It is really SAD that your father died at such a young age (I am 56, people now live to 95 and older...) and worse that your mother aged so quickly after your Dad died. What is even more sad is a LOT of people today also "live to die" as they have no goals, no dreams in their lives.    |`|24vQ8D71aa	i learned most of it from the elderly people i worked with.  old age sux.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	My parents always told us it was wonderful to grow old.  And that the older you grew, the more wonderful life was and that you were fortunate to be alive at any age.  Both of my parents lived to be 97 years old.  My dad died in 1997 at age 97 1/2, Mom lived five years longer and she died in 2002 at age 97.  She was very lonely when Dad died, and she couldn't wait to join him.They always said, whoever went first would wait at the foot of the rainbow for the other one to join them, and together they would dance over the rainbow into eternity.  Mom always worried that Dad would grow tired of waiting for her, but I know that that is what they did - danced over the rainbow into eternity together.

He's trading you for her and continuing to be a child but with a sex life.  And at 22 it's none of your concern why he needs condoms. It seems that's one area of his life that he is being responsible about.  Stop the allowance as it is your way of controlling him. Keep the car or sell it to him. Again this is your way of keeping him a child. Seems you have a problem and he is struggling to grow up.   A good parent is one that prepares and allows their child to leave and become a productive adult.  You need a new hobby. You'll be happier and though you can't see it now the new relationship with respect for him will bring you both closer and provide a much more healthy relationship between the two of you.  The older woman will be good for him as he is trying to move away from you and has picked someone that is not too different from you but will allow more adult behavior on his part. He will transition to someone his own age. She knows this and is proving what he needs right now and it is her little project that she is enjoying for now.

There's something seriously wrong with junior.   Because, It's just NOT RIGHT for a 22 year old to want to be with  an OLD lady. (Especially, one that lives in a single wide!)   Perhaps an Odepes Rex Complex ? (sic) it means "thoughts of intercourse relations with your mother".  I probably need to learn how to spell that, but HE needs a shrink.|`|UHjXC1Jhaa	he's 22 years old and allowed to do whatever he wants.

It's called tough love.  Let him go.|`|pog5Nqj5aa	Yes, stop his allowance and anything else you're giving him.  If the car is registered in his name, you really can't keep it even if you bought it for him.      At any rate, it's time for him to grow up.  Let him move in with his girlfriend. He's an adult and you can't stop him, but you don't have to support his decision either.  Let him know that you think it's a wrong choice. Give him some logical reasons why you believe it is and not emotional ones.    It sounds to me like she used sex to snare him, and it has gone to his head--especially in light of his lack of romantic experience. He's not thinking logically right now.  More than likely, however, this whole thing will blow over soon enough.    Good luck!|`|vZMN82U8aa	give him your blessings, and let him go... your a=obviously wealthy enough to suport him and buy him a car etc.. was that conditional on some form of morality scale...     let him keep the car, stop the allowance by all means, but dot get petty... youll regret it, and for gods sake, dont ask him to choose... youll lose, every time... love is blind. but as you found condoms, it also means love isnt stupid!     we all make mistakes, its what makes us who we are as adults... |`|AA11054743	Why hed want a mother figure when he already has a mother no .    Your right i think to cut his money off cos once he moves out regardless of the conditions you shouldn't be giving him money anyways cos he's on his own then and time to fend for himself i think.  Let him see what the real worlds like and with her. He wont be long in running home with his tail between his legs when he has to grow up.    Maybe hes just going with this older woman to defy yous, sort of rebellion perhaps. And on there own i think the novelty will wear off cos is she willing to support him and will he like that.        Good luck.|`|g1aJke8uaa	Tell him he can go, BUT there will be no more allowance as you don't feel a need to support his girlfriend and the car stays with you as you don't feel obligated to transport her.  If he wants to be with her, he can get a job and help her meet the living expenses.  Its time for you to take back those rose colored glasses you put on him too.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	You can be worried about him, but he is 22 and now he has to make his own choices.    We all make mistakes, and the only thing we can hope for your children, is that the mistakes we see them making, will teach them something.    Since he is 22, why not let him look after himself completely.  Let him get a job and provide for himself and this new lady.   In a way you are doing what some do for alcoholics, you are enabling him.    Since he is old enough to choose for himself, then he is old enough to provide for himself.    You will be doing him a favour if you cut off his "generous allowance", and let him find his own money.    You being angry, frustrated and nagging, will only do the opposite that you want.   You will be estranged, completely from him, and you know you do not want that.    Just say "You are old enough to make your own decision, and if you want to move in with this "lady", then we wish you luck.   Since you are now making your own way in the world, we think it is time that we not give you an allowance anymore.  So, this will assist you in being your own man, which you seem to want.  We wish you all the luck in the world, and we will always be here  for you, but will not give you money from this point on.'    Keep it positive, keep it loving, and do not be angry.  That will be the best way, if you want to keep any relationship with him at all.|`|0caf53b900186149588737e604ecaafcaa	Give him his freedom >>>>>> and his condoms back!!!! This is his chance to grow up and be on his own so to speak. He will learn so much from this experience. Take his money away and explain he has made this decision and you do not agree with it. Do not alienate him as if you are to stubborn about it you will drive him away. Show your support and even offer to buy his condoms for him to make sure you do not have any surprise grandchildren.Tell him you love him and you will love him no matter what his bad decisions are.    Good Luck!!!!|`|dc30aad63e4c7035adedf59b9b7ec273aa	i don't know where you are coming from on this one after all hes 22 years old hes old enough to make his own mind up   you should be supporting him in what he wants to do even if you don't like it or even understand the love of a older woman is not a crime and be honest theres a lot worse things he could be doing    if your so worried about him just think how you will feel if he just goes and you never hear from him .|`|385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	If you gave him a car you have no right to take it from him - the car is his, it was a gift.  Who he chooses to have a relationship with is unfrotunately for you none of your business.  As an adult he is free to choose who he wants to spend his time with.  Why on earth are you keeping him anyway - you will just create a loser who cannot fend for himself.  Untie him from your apron strings and let him live his life - living is about making choices and mistakes.  She may be the love of his life or he may grow out of it soon - who knows, but it is not for you to decide.  You've never stopped mothering him so maybe he is looking for another mummy to take over.|`|FdOjT08saa	Sounds like a control issue to me. You have been controlling him by using the car and allowance and a free ride. It has affected his social skills if he has not had a girlfriend before.  Now he has someone. Though she is not of the caliber or age you would select for him he has chosen her.   I know two women who are in their 60's who have3 husbands in their early 40's. These men were in their 20's when they fell in love and married these women.  Your son may or may not have a long term relationship with her.  But it is his life. At least he is using condoms as she is obviously not inexperienced.  You bought him the car if you can keep it that means it is still in your name and wasn't really "given" to him. We gave my daughter a car at 17 and put it in her name. That is a gift. Sounds like you were controlling him even where the car is concerned.  Time to let this boy fly and become a man.  Continue to be there for him but quit controlling him.|`|sqdsIHwAaa	it's his life you will have to leave it to him to live it his own way.

That the Only way he will learn.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Gotta be careful this doesn't sound like a control issue. Let him know you don't care what he does when he moves out but while at home, it's you rules.    Stop the allowance ( he should be able to find some kind of work and apparently he has no costs to living with you.)    Sign the car over to him unless it is really newer and expensive. This costs a little money though. Then make sure he is the only listed owner and the insurance is in his name only. Then, if there is an accident and lawsuit, you wont be named as owners/insurers of the car.    Tell him you love him but it is time to be on his own. Let him know this has nothing to do with his choice of girlfriend, although I am sure she is using the young man for several things but money is the main one.    If he balks at the idea, tell him he can visit  and you can give him meals and such but it is time to go. Might also mention that a man his age that does not know where a pocket full of condoms came from, needs to live on his own and learn these things in the big world.    I am sure it will strain the relationship but you have to decide if you will be supporting him his whole life while he runs yours, or if he needs to make do on his own. Sounds harsh but better now than when he is 30 years old.|`|51EFEv4Baa	that is a serious problem  why u r asking this to people in the internet that do not have nothing to do  go and talk with a specialist maybe a physiologist |`|uFYdPL8Zaa	Some kinky stuff going on.

I completely understand that you're horrified, but there are a couple of silver linings in this -     It's not going to last, you know that  He's not going to get her pregnant and therefore a permanent fixture in his life.    Let him get on with it, but stop the allowance and hold onto the car.  If he's old enough to make up his own mind, he's old enough to start making his own living.  Just don't do anything silly like disown him or refuse to have anything to do with him, or even when he comes to his senses, he may never forgive you.  It's a phase.  |`|TZUREb0Taa	Unless there is a complicating issue like mental health or disability, I would think a 22 year old might be expected to make his own decisions and support himself.|`|TO3K2xrcaa	Sit down and have a long talk about it.    Tell him about your objections and ask him why he wants to do this.    And yes, I do think you are in the right.|`|1ITbfrdUaa	Sorry Mom and Dad, you're son is an adult now. He's over 18... in fact, he's over 21. It's perfectly legal although possibly not what you would want for him. Don't "enable" him. Let him know that he's making adult decisions so you will no longer be supporting him in any way financially. Let him know that you love him anyway because he is your son.     Did he go to college? You could offer to pay for college if he goes to school on the other side of the country!     Added:  You may want to think about why he is with someone so much older than he is. Are there any illegal drugs involved?     Does he have a poor self image? Is he overweight? Does he take care of himself? What is he good at doing? Maybe if you encourage him to start becoming involved with activities that make him feel better about himself, he will also begin to find new friends and acquaintances closer to his own age.     What has he always enjoyed doing? Or liked from afar? How about something in the martial arts? Or mechanical? Or technology related?     He is probably with this woman because she makes him somehow feel better about himself. Instead of cutting her down, encourage any steps he makes to feel better and do good things for himself. The better he feels about himself the less he will need to seek that from anyone else.    Added:    Be glad that he's being smart and using condoms. Although the risk of pregnancy is fairly low, it will potentially protect him from sexually transmitted diseases.     Also, a 22-year-old man should not need to answer questions from his parents about what he is doing with condoms. Sorry Mom and Dad, but it isn't your business.  He's not 14 or 15.     It's time to no longer treat him like a child or a teenager. Is he your youngest or your only child? Mom and Dad, it may be helpful to talk to a counselor to find out what you can be doing to help yourselves to let him go and therefore, ultimately help him.     When we were about to be married, my father shared this poem with me, as one of his favorites. Perhaps, you or others may find it helpful.    On Children     by Kahlil Gibran    Your children are not your children.  They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.  They come through you but not from you,  And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.    You may give them your love but not your thoughts,  For they have their own thoughts.  You may house their bodies but not their souls,  For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,  which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.  You may strive to be like them,  but seek not to make them like you.  For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.    You are the bows from which your children  as living arrows are sent forth.  The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite,  and He bends you with His might  that His arrows may go swift and far.  Let our bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;  For even as He loves the arrow that flies,  so He loves also the bow that is stable.    http://www.katsandogz.com/onchildren.htm...|`|u4JWalWRaa	Tell him that his girlfriend may die 31 years before he does.|`|9rCcdJdDaa	let him be rape with a nice looking prostitute so that he will know the difference between old and young.

But if he really loves her, and he is serious about this relationship, then I think he should live his own life. He's 22 for gosh sakes.|`|1YQynQMpaa	hes 22 hes going to make mistakes .he thinks sex is love.the little head overrides the big head.growing up is a bunch of mistakes we try to make sense of later.just be around when he really needs you.that is love|`|daa2e5f39c7121c441f34a09190b0551aa	As a mother I know is hard to make since of the choices our kids make. But at one point there is nothing you can do of the choices they are making. All you can do is pray that God will keep him safe. You have to make him learn from his mistakes, you and I know that this is a mistake but is hard to make him understand. Hope this helps you. Good luck!|`|aCOJYTIVaa	Just ignore Big Papi - he cannot spell - let alone offer some semblance of advice.  All of us Mothers like to protect our children - often to excess - and I think that you may have done this.  WHY ARE YOU giving an allowance to a 22 year old.  Stop at once - force him to find a job.  You are not helping him to be independent by giving him money.   Secondly - let him find out for himself just what a 53 year  old CANNOT DO for his sex life!!  If you ignore the situation (and do NOT invite her to your home when HE wants to visit you) the whole thing will probably blow over in a matter of days!  I know because I  am a  Mother to 5 adult children, and have been down a similar path - they are now all independent.  AS for the car - yes take away the keys  but let him keep the condoms - at least he was smart in that department  - good luck!  CJ |`|MGalQ2PIaa	Pray!|`|kxVCHSb5aa	Why are you giving a 22 year old an allowance? You should not try to stop him. He is a man now.|`|DcI3h6kbaa	yup..take everything away from him....you gave him those things and if he is not going to listen to you and understand what you are saying then he does not deserve those things...take everything away and well see how long that old lady keeps him..she is prolly only using him for his money anyway....let him go live with her and lets see how long it lasts...when the money runs out and they can barely make ends meet, he will come back to you and then you can slap him across the head and say 'I told you so"|`|klBLBbV3aa	You have a problem, and it started way back. Why is he on an allowance at 22? Anyway, cut it off. He can do as he likes alright, but nothing says you must subsidize it.     I suspect something deeply wrong with his parents/raising, and in your hearts you know what's wrong already. Don't you?|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	Bet she wont be so interested in him when he shows up with no car, job or money. Time for this 22 year old baby to grow up and get a life, car,job and home of his own.|`|VBvv7Edeaa	Where do I start? First the idea of a 22 year old man having a generous allowance escapes me.Yes please sell the car,pack his bags and say let go and let God. Maybe she can help him grow up.  really !!!please answer your own question as if someone else had ask it. step out of your skin and take a look at your self.|`|oYbfrWNzaa	Our kids are like arrows.  If we don't let them go they will never hit the target.  My advice would be stop the generous allowance. He is spending it on the woman.  Keep the car.  Be happy he is using condoms.  I am not saying cut him off financially in order to bribe him to stay.  I am saying it is time for him to become independent of you.  Please don't cripple him.  Money is nothing compared to knowing you can hold your head high that you are able to figure things out  and not rely on your parents.  Tell him you wish him the best and agree it's time for him to spread his wings.  You can express your opinion on how you feel about him dating an older woman IF he asks your opinion.  Otherwise, bathe him in prayer and be patient as he learns life lessons.  Take care.|`|ZVsrg16saa	Sounds like you've  over indulged that boy too much . He's obviously besotted with the woman and she should have more sense ! I would tell him to leave and wish him good luck . I would stop his allowance and sell the car . He is old enough to make up his own mind . My old man chucked me out when i was 16 , it was the best thing he ever did for me . I grew up very quickly . I know it's a difficult situation . But i think you've made a rod for your back . I'm not being nasty , But he's made his bed !!|`|NSz8Impmaa	Let him go, he has to stand on his own two feet, you must be mad giving him an allowance at his age. He should be working and giving you an allowance.|`|s7dqG0iSaa	 let him live his life ,its good hes moving in with her and not expecting to move in with you. i wouldn't help him financially. when he needs mom and dad and  food your door must be open. don't worry wont last long but let him get it out his system hel come out more mature.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	You have every right to stop being so generous. Keep the car if you paid for it and stop the generous allowance. If he wants to sit on his a** all day fine, but you shouldn't have to subsidize his lazy, selfish, entitled behavior. Since he's 22, there's not much you can do but sit back and wait for him to grow up. If he wants to move in with this woman you can't stop him. But you can stop financing his laziness. Good luck. Been there, done that.    Mikedrazehero: What a nice, well thought-out answer. You sound wise.|`|1k7pcUHkaa	hes 22  hes aloud 2 do what he wants|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Jenny, I could not have sid it better than Picasso did. . .he is an adult, keep loving him but he will soon grow up and come to his senses when the older woman gets tired of him . . .|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Wow, this is a tough one.  I think it is ridiculous - this woman is old enough to be his mother for heaven sakes.  If it was one of my kids, I would be very upset.  However, there is nothing that you can do, and I don't think it is worth worrying yourself sick over.  He is of age, and free to do as he pleases  He will eventually see the   light.  I can't say that it won't last, because how does one really know his feelings.  He may really care for this woman.  Best to leave things alone and let it work itself out. I am sure it is very hard for you to see this happening, I know it would be for me. Just pray for him.|`|AA10045620	Does your son know he will not have an allowance or car?  That he would actually have to go out and get a job to support himself?  Don't think his girlfriend would be too keen on supporting him and getting him a vehicle to drive.  I would lay it on the line about what would happen should he decide to move out.|`|17EV9uuLaa	You can't live his life for him and they will not just listen. It is a good time to make drastic changes and lay down the law. He will come back so keep his room clean. Best not to get too involved.|`|AA11623203	I have a son who is 26, and I don't know what I would do if he moved in with a woman that was older than me.  She should be ashamed of herself.  Since you gave your son the car, you don't have the right to keep it.  As far as putting gas in it or paying for car repairs or car insurance, that is his responsibility, but it should be his choice.  I guess you are thinking in terms if he has it, she will get her hands on it.  I can see your worry.  As much as we love our children, once they reach 21 there is not much we can do. I believe your son will tire of this relationship after the sex wears off.  Right now, he has never had a girlfriend, and this woman is probably enjoying your son b/c he is at his sexual peak and can provide her with sexual enjoyment at her "old age," but believe me it won't last.  It takes money to sustain a relationship, and it sounds like neither one of them have it.  Your son will probably want to return home in a few months.  I would be surprised if he didn't.  Good luck!!|`|yDJiiqcsaa	There is an ancient legal precept that says, "Your actions reveal your intentions" .   Based on his actions he is a very disturbed individual.  What can any parent "do" when their child is of legal age ?  You can prevent him from doing things but you don't have to subsidize it either. But I'm sure that the money is not the paramount of your concern.  It's very difficult to stand and watch as your child injures him/herself.   The best thing that I could say is write him a letter. Writing is best because : you won't get interrupted by him and therefore you will get it all said; you can read it and reread it and re write it until it says EXACTLY what you want to say in hopefully the way that would be most conducive for him to accept.   I'm sorry for your pain.  I will pray for you and him. 
df7fb36bae1abdd4af9e29793de794dcaa	i do not know but that is a good question|`|50b6ebb4ba12a7e7f094be06c48d18faaa	No, I don't think so.  There was never a warrior class in Indonesia.|`|brqnVWuzaa	No, Indonesia always had a history of people being merchants. I do not think that samurai's were ever in Indonesia. Yet I would be surpised if samurai warriors from other countries passed through Indonesia.
SfGyzMSFaa	I can't remember not knowing who Will Rogers was. Even though he died more than 20 years before I was born, some of my older aunts and uncles quoted him frequently. I have seen one or two of his movies; his lariet (rope) work was awesome; but reading his books and newspaper columns is far more fun for me.    So many of his quotes are timeless:    `People talk peace. But men give their life's work to war. It won't stop 'til there is as much brains and scientific study put to aid peace as there is to promote war.'     `As bad as we sometimes think our government is run, it is the best run I ever saw.'     "Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment."    "Your mothers get mighty shocked at you girls nowadays, but in her day, her mother was just on the verge of sending her to reform school."    "The only way to solve the traffic problems of the country is to pass a law that only paid-for cars are allowed to use the highways. That would make traffic so scarce we could use the boulevards for children's playgrounds."    I love reading his old newspaper columns; you can get them in book form from a library or bookstore, but they are also available online:    Will Rogers, The Daily Telegrams  http://www.willrogers.com/papers/daily/d...    One of his books is available online at Project Gutenberg:    Rogers-isms  The Cowboy Philosopher on the Peace Conference  by Will Rogers  at Project Gutenberg (free online books)  http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20566/205...    I'm delighted to find other Will Rogers fans; it's fun to meet other people who read and appreciate his wit.|`|AA10570396	Funny ,Intelligent and I would of loved to sit and just talked to him.

He did a lot of good things for people. He was a true hero. There are several books about him and by him. He had a very high IQ. He adopted like 12 kids.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I always enjoy reading his quotes & as for movies, I didn't know he was in them.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Yes!  He was a great person, funny with some great quotes and sayings.  Below are some of the web pages I refer to many times - and  little history about him for those that want to red about him.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	I remember that he had a lot of very wise things he said and made famous. I've read some of his quotes online.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	I saw his movie "Judge Priest".  It was funny and warm hearted.|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	Yes.  My dad enjoyed reading about Will Rogers and my dad told me about him.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	He was very witty .Here in Oklahoma we honor his name still.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	I remember his movies.  My parents talked about him.  He was so popular he could have been elected President.  Oklahoma put him on the ballet, but he turned it down.  He said, "I never met a man I didn't like."  "All I know is what I read in the papers." "Everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects."  There are many, many more, but this is all I can think of right now.  He was flying with Wiley Post in Alaska when the plane went down.  They were both killed.  This was in the mid 30s.|`|5fcb63ddb036024a80cdbdf4a1e4a372aa	He was wonderful.

Yee Hawww!!!|`|80lWqRFiaa	Yes, I have read some about him, plan on doing more when I get free time. That is what I do in the cold winter months here in Minnesota. |`|O9FojdEMaa	i believe he died when i was four but i remember seeing the movie about his life and some of his quotes the most important being "i never met a man i didn't like".|`|FdOjT08saa	Sure he was so interesting.

aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	Grandma - It certainly is.  I do worry about the day that I will forget to remember.  My friend sent this to me.  It's a humorous way to answer your question.    Forgetter Be Forgotten    My forgetter's getting better,   But my rememberer is broke   To you that may seem funny   But, to me, that is no joke     For when I'm 'here' I'm wondering   If I really should be 'there'   And, when I try to think it through,   I haven't got a prayer!     Oft times I walk into a room,   Say 'what am I here for?'   I wrack my brain, but all in vain!   A zero, is my score.     At times I put something away   Where it is safe, but, Gee!   The person it is safest from   Is, generally, me!     When shopping I may see someone,   Say 'Hi' and have a chat,   Then, when the person walks away   I ask myself, 'who the hell was that?'     Yes, my forgetter's getting better   While my rememberer is broke,   And it's driving me plumb crazy   And that isn't any joke.     Thanks for the question.  DeeJay.|`|2JvM6hucaa	I sometimes feel like I spent half my time trying to remember what I did with something I just had in my hands a minute ago.

It happens but not to often, I will try to remember something, a name, something I  wanted, and my mind just goes blank. Often I go into another room for something, then can't remember what it was for.  Also, I constantly misplace my glasses - I think we are all having senior moments!  One good thing though - we have a lot of company in our "boat" and we are all heading in the same direction.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	Oh yes. I hate having to retrace my steps to see if I can remember why I went into a certain room. Where I put my glasses or car keys when I'm holding them in my hand. And when I make a shopping list and get to the store only to realize that the list is still on the kitchen table.    I recently read a health e-mail that research shows B12 helps improve the memory in seniors, so I bought a bottle to see if it does help. Now, if I can just remember where I put the bottle.....|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	No, I just checked to see if I had already offered my answer to your question because I didn't want to repeat myself and it would scare me to think that I could come up with two totally different answers to the same question. Perhaps that would prove that I am more creative in my old age. |`|6ozmjp3xaa	 If they can make memory cards for all these new video games,  When are they going to make them for us seniors?

8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	Those childhood Santa Claus days, the childhoods of the children we raised, then losing our parents, yeah, it all comes into play during those holidays.  I walked in WalMart yesterday and BAM.  A huge, decorated tree already, and not even Thanksgiving yet.  I guess tradition is valuable for its stabilizing effect, its marking of time, but in this economy, except for those who've not suffered, holiday music and gift ideas thrown in your face are only reminders of what you can't do this year.  There's a irrelevant, disrespectful, arrogant pressure in it.|`|45UTKuamaa	IF YOU REMEMBER THEM ARE THEY NOT ALIVE IN SOME WAY,AND THE FACT THAT YOU LISTEN TO WHAT THEY LEFT BEHIND WILL KEEP THEM ALIVE ON SOME LEVEL|`|wnsFO3GCaa	Talking of early Christmas mentions, my next door neighbour has a wreath on their door already! I don't think it is strange listening to Christmas songs by deceased performers, just as I don't think it is strange to listen to 'normal' music or read books by deceased artists. It is pleasant to know that their Christmas message has past the test of time.    Please don't call it x-mas. I'm not religious but I think it is a bit discourteous to replace Christ with an X. |`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	Yes! I think we should get past Thanksgiving first......and black Friday....then ring the bells!!  BTW, I agree with "half drawn boy" I think Christ deserves more that an X!!!|`|AA11570788	Let's deal with Thanksgiving first.  Then think about Christmas.  Most people enjoy Christmas music anyway.   X in Xmas also stands for the Greek letter Chi, which is the beginning letter of Christos in Greek.  |`|hallarIxaa	I wish they would limit playing that music until one week before Xmas.

Here in Australia, we have dead crooners banging on about "White" Christmas.  About 99% of Australians have to take a week off work to even see snow.   And Christmas is right in the middle of our Summer.  Grandma, am I the first one to wish you 'Merry Christmas'?|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Well , I think everyone has gotten way off point... I think people especially kids Just like to sing the jingles, and don't really know who sings the original song anymore, so ...the deceased person who originally wrote or sang the song does not come into mind, thank god..I would think This person or people would want us to rejoice and be happy in the Holiday season, and not think of such sad things...P.S. Just My humble opinion.|`|q0Sz91wsaa	I think on Christmas day, dead people are the farthest thing from anybody's mind.. And why do you call it X-mas.|`|pOYwgTARaa	You are cool and have a lot of time to spare.|`|aRcgOv1daa	I know the other day I was in wal-mart and I noticed they were already playing xmas music and it makes me crazy.I like xmas music but not this soon.|`|htrtTXopaa	Grass Welch, why would you say dead people are far from anyone's mind on christmas. I think the first thing people think about are loved one's who have passed on. anyways, the best thing to do is to think about the person singing and the message their singing. Have a Merry Christmas. I'm sure at that time in that person's life, they had a Merry Christmas. Their just telling you to have a merry christmas. lift you up. It's a good question though . I never thought of it in that perspective!|`|34090baae43bdcb8c4c4335f475f6aa1aa	I never even think of the singer as being deceased, I just enjoy the lovely songs they sing.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	It doesn't make me feel strange, but it does make me feel bad.  I love their voices, and it takes me back home with Mom and Dad and my sisters and brother.  Mom and Dad have been gone a while, my brother and older sister are not well and it just brings back memories.  The voices I hear are so much better than any of the crazy music they call christmas music today.  It just can't hold a candle to any of the old timers with their mellow voices.  I love to hear Dean Martin, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra  sing the lovely Christmas music from my past.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	Oh no, I think it is wonderful because it brings back so many wonderful memories of Christmas music when I was growing up. Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole were two that my folks loved to hear at Christmas. I am just grateful that we are able to hear the the voices of these well loved artists. Music and the artists that sing those songs are timeless...thank God.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	no it hasn't  everyone loves hearing christmas music even if the singer is dead     it still accomplishes the cheer and joy of the holiday season|`|O9FojdEMaa	i dislike the use of the term x-mas or the use of the phrase Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas or referring to it as mid winter holidays. we celebrate the birth of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST and i strongly prefer the use of HIS name and refuse to acknowledge the Happy Holidays greeting or anything which excludes the name of our LORD and Savior. P.S. my father died Christmas Eve 1949 and he is always on my mind during the Christmas Season.|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	I love the music this time of year especially old and familiar songs and singers from long ago.
4SF4KGu4aa	Oil is a global commodity. If a country, say China, didn't have any, they might want to go to war to get some. Other than business getting involved, making oil global keeps all countries on an "even keel" in theory and keeps the peace. ( also in theory)    The US has a lot of oil and natural gas and coal. However, laws were passed to keep from drilling in many of the best locations because of nature, animals, visual blight or pretty much anything that could be used.    So now, we buy 70 percent of our oil from other countries while we sit on huge reservoirs in our own land. There were also laws passed that kept the number of oil refineries that produce gasoline ( among about a dozen other products) to a set amount. Then when hurricanes hit and knock out a refinery, there is less gas to go around and the price goes up.    It really comes down to what we are willing to do as a country not just one group or another. There are so many special interest groups that  will sue someone as soon as it looks like they are going to drill or produce oil. Then it never gets done and we end up going back to the early 1800s. ( except there isn't enough whale oil to go around now for our lighting) This truly could happen if we don't get off our duffs and do something instead of just debating.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Ret.Sgt. is top dead center in his answer.|`|80lWqRFiaa	We have tremendous resources in North Dakota and Alaska and more that need to be tapped. It would greatly affect our gas prices and needs to be done.|`|f740e67fa5fe634438bdb3faea74791faa	Years ago we drilled our own oil, but we had to stop because we depleted our resources, typical American huh?|`|rkEXGEgoaa	Yes, we do have oil here but not enough to supply our demand. There still are a few places drilling but ot enough. I think our money would be better spent using solar and wind generated power.|`|j8Mv99OQaa	We do have oil. But, not enough to meet our energy needs. That is why we import it. I am afraid that if people think we can just go back to our old wells, and find a wealth of oil just for the pumping, they are badly misguided. It will cost a lot to try to pump our own oil since it will be harder to get it out. Most of our wells are called stripper wells which means that they strip the last of the oil from the old wells. Any new wells will not make up for the decline in the overall decline of oil worldwide. We have found most of the oil deposits here on the North American continent. Mexico is in decline and Canada is trying to use the tar sands to produce oil. The tar sands require a lot of natural gas to heat the water to wash the oil out of the sands. Then you have a disposal problem with the leftover sand. It still contains a lot of oil and it cannot just be dumped anywhere. We will eventually have to fight for any oil we need, it has already started in the middle east, that is why we don't want to leave the region. We are afraid that other countries will come in and take the oil and that would really have an effect on our economy.|`|g1aJke8uaa	It is simplistic, politicians are the ones who complicated everything with foreign policy.  Most countries do have their own oil, the globe was populated with dinosaures and it was their remains that turned into oil.  Your right, but you have something that the politicians don't have.  common sense.|`|0caf53b900186149588737e604ecaafcaa	Oil shmoil! Last I heard, wind was free. We are wasting so much time . We need to be developing wind and solar(also free)! I really think that is our future. Use these to run our homes and businesses and use the oil for our vehicles. Then there would be plenty of oil and we wouldn't be dependent on foreign oil.   This is a no brainer as far as I am concerned until someone proves me different.|`|KWwW7N49aa	Maybe, but you are forgetting the global economy that so many businessmen savor (i.e., you buy mine, I'll buy yours).  It is not about the citizens, it is about the money.$$$$$|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Absolutely we should drill for our own oil.  Why in the world this government wants to do any business with countries that want to destroy us is beyond me.  We should not be dependent upon these people thatwant to destroy the us.  I say drill our own oil and take care of ourselves, let them take care of themselves.  It all comes down to greed - money, money, money.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	No, they don't, and those that don't have to go elsewhere to purchase it.      The United States has NOT depleted its oil reserves, but we have depleted those reserves that are easy to get to.  We can drill for our own oil, but it will take a huge toll on the environment, and it will be years before that oil is ready for market.  American refineries are old and decrepit, and the environmental lobby will prevent either upgrades or new construction.  Everything comes with a price.  If this country had made an effort in the mid-70's to develop alternative energy sources, we wouldn't be in this predicament today.  But we were too much in love - still are - with our huge gas guzzlers and cheap gas to let them go.  We will never see cheap gas again.
ChvzdwrEaa	I wouldn't necessarily believe anything Glenn Beck says. He's a conservative nut-job. He doesn't even believe in global warming.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Only when I have to regurgitate something.  He is the male version of Nancy Grace.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I've tried to keep an open mind about different political perspectives but he gives me the same feeling as fingernails on a chalkboard. I can't watch him.|`|ffbbb387bd63bd0363e7b715ef26680caa	I used to like Glenn Beck, but  I think he's getting closer and closer to becoming a conspiracy theorist.  Some of the stuff he says is pretty out there.  I don't really think of him as an accurate reporter of America's condition or as a prophet of America's future.  As far as SS is concerned, it wouldn't surprise me if a phase out is started.  It seems that they would have to notify people that by a certain date, say 50 years down the road, SS will no longer exist.  There will have to be ample notice so that people can prepare for their retirement.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	I sometimes watch Glen Beck, but I think he is a big windbag.  The government wouldn't dare allow social security to run out - there would be a huge uprising of senior citizens in this country if they did.|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	I try to watch him sometimes but I don't stay with it.|`|UllYFJgjaa	Loosing everything especially Social Security is my worst fear. We will be living on the streets. Maybe we could all hook up together and build our cardboard box homes next to each other and be neighbors......support each other....|`|CkKlZFVmaa	I happen to like Glenn Beck, but do not watch it a lot.  TV is for when I have absolutely nothing else to do.  I think it is a good thing when we are alerted to what is going on with our politicians, at least maybe they will feel like they are being watched|`|AA12258992	I watched him a few times, but don't anymore.    I don't care for his views too much.    John McCain wants to privatize Social Security.  It will certainly be gone if that happens!    The Government needs to stop borrowing from Social Security, also!|`|NFY4A1csaa	I watch him a couple of times a week.  He was one of many who warned quite a while ago of the financial crisis we are going through now.  His book "An Inconvenient Book" is interesting.  He points out the many flaws of Al Gore's book.|`|9kmFGPBqaa	Yes, I watch Glenn Beck as often as possible. I have to agree with him. We paid into the system and we deserve our Social Security. Perhaps this country could stop sending billions over seas and take care of their own|`|f8097de47ae58031953feaf9b3ebd6cdaa	 Glen Beck is a nut.  Sometimes he says something that is legal or in the realm of reality.  Then he spouts off about things that can only lead to illegal or unaccepted things for our government to do.  
AA11296212	Aye, aye.  Paul was just a good Ohio Buckeye who lived his life well, entertained millions with some of the finest movies ever made over five decades, donated more than $200 million to children camps and other charities, and remained faithful for 50 years ("Why would I go looking for hamburg when I have steak at home?").  A good man, a good friend, a good human being.    I have 37 of his movies in my archives...come on over to see your favorite.    One favorite line comes from "Harper"..."Only cream and bastards rise to the top."|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	AYE. He was my favorite for a couple of decades. He was a good guy with a kind heart.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	AYE!!  And, I like his salad dressings too!  He was a great human being, and did a lot of wonderful things for less fortunate folks.  The world has lost a great man.|`|AA12038658	Aye! He was one of those guys who was still hot into his old age!|`|xyt9NdjVaa	Aye-men    I always had a lot of respect for him and wife. They were not your 'typical' Hollywood couple. Their committment to one another in their marriage was something to admire. He was a fine actor, and will be missed. Thanks be that we can still have his work to watch over the years. They don't make 'em like Newman anymore. |`|2R3iJnFPaa	me|`|6ozmjp3xaa	 I said it real loud Did you hear me? AYE|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Although he had the  prettiest blue eyes, I wasn't a real fan. He came  across as too moody to me. His facial expressions seemed too ser-  ious most of the time. Exept when he played Butch Cassidy. I first  thought he was a wannabe of Marlon Brando. And I wasn't a fan of  his either. He proved to be a very good actor, and I enjoyed many of  his movies, but not all. I'm probably in the minority, but he just wasn't  the greatest, to me as an actor. He was a good humanitarian though  and helped alot of youth in his time. He was a good guy, just not a  great actor, in my book.|`|AA10797214	It is very sad that we are loosing the good Actors, like Paul Newman. He will be sadly missed by his family and so many that have enjoyed his Movies. May he rest in peace, and my sympathy to Joane Woodward and the children.|`|24vQ8D71aa	AYE|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	AYE - AYE -  He was a touch of class and so was his wife.    He was born in 1925 . . . 10 years before I was born.    I'm thinking, that I have seen all of his movies.    One of my favorites - Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.    The sound track for that movie is also one of my favorite CD's.    Lots of memories.  DeeJay.  |`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	Aye.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	Aye! One of my favorite movies of his was Nobodies Fool.|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	Aye.|`|f8812f78f1ba5e0fefd58a87005ce671aa	Aye.  Favorite movie in which he starred:  "THE HUSTLER"|`|5f930dd66cfee7f04720c41de82939d8aa	He was quite a person as well as an actor. . .|`|ALEPgPpRaa	NAY!!!! 10/07|`|SZudGT82aa	AYE !

I almost saw my dream come true. A gal can dream can't she?|`|xyt9NdjVaa	Yes you may, dear Denis! My (and my husbands) dream home is a ranch style (no more stairs) log cabin home. A small lake, (filled with crappie, bass and catfish) in front of the home, pine trees all around with plenty of wildlife, (and I'm not referring to us!) A small vegetable garden, and what flowering gardening I can do. I absolutely love the country. I was raised in the city, thought I would just die when I married and moved to the country, but after 29 yrs of marriage, I came to love it, and long to go back to the country. There is an inner peace one can find when you live away from all the hustle and bustle. The peace and quiet becomes your solace. It brought me closer to nature, and to God. You realize how amazing the creation is. Many a time working in my flower gardens, I had some very nice heartfelt, casual conversations with God, thanking him for the life I had.

I'm talking more like a large manor house with the large squared turrets at each corner and a center courtyard, but built from stone.  My reality dream house is the one were living in. The rooms are large the closets so big I have friends that are jealous one told me to put twin beds in them and rent them out. She was joking but they would hold a twin bed and a small chest of drawers and have room to move around.. It has living room, dining room, large den, kitchen with breakfast area, huge laundry room and a walk in pantry with the three bedrooms and two full baths, both baths have built in linen closets.. We're on a corner with huge front and back yards, the two car garage is also finished. The only thing I wish was the kitchen to be a bit bigger, and a fire place, but when you have all the the rest you sure shouldn't gripe. We were so lucky we must have looked at 50 houses, then this one came up and it's only a few doors from my daughters, We don't have any real flooding in our tract of houses and we are not in a evacuation zone from hurricanes. I think for a category four or five I'm going to evacuate me and mine anyway.

In front of my house so I could enjoy the passer by's in the summer night. I know this sounds like I'm nosy, but I'm not. We always had a front porch  when I was growing up and it was real relaxing rocking and enjoying the night sights. This I would say is my only requirement I would want for my dream house. God bless.|`|9BtA5Knfaa	Mine would be a well build Contemporary, about 3,100 sq ft with a totally open floor plan, vaulted ceilings, huge fireplace, totally professional top of the line kitchen, because I love to cook. 4 bedrooms 3.5 baths, master bedroom suit, full basement with 9 foot ceilings (so I can have my movie room) with a 2.5 car garage attached! All this sitting on 25 acres in the Cayman Islands! Oh I forgot about the backyard, I would like to have a beautiful in-ground pool/ hot tub with the surroundings looking like it was taken out of the jungle, vines, flowers, palm trees and so on!    KNOW THAT'S WERE I WANT TO DIE!    and YES I am a big dreamer too!!!|`|7wMZIuooaa	A pleasure to answer a nice easy question for a change..thanks..    So, I like your cottage idea...I would also love a big Log cabin, with at least 4 bedrooms, everything in it must be built with wood so it would always smell natural.  Big log fires, cosy lighting and nice and warm.  In the countryside, near a river and away from everyone else.    It would have a large porch on the front so that myself and my husband can sit in two old rockers like a pair of old codgers, just sit and watch nature at its best, especially the wonderful sun sets.  There would be wild flowers everywhere and I would like to keep it wild but tidy.  I would have a veg garden and a herb garden, apple trees, pear trees and plums.  I would keep a few chickens in the hen house and have fresh eggs everyday.  I would not be able to kill the chickens though, bit of a coward.    So I look forward to winning the lottery this weekend, and I shall give you a call for you to order your dream house, how's that?|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	I would like a cottage on the lake!!

Off grid as I once was is a dream for now.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I've always loved the ocean, so I'd love a warm and cozy beach house.  Maybe not real close to the ocean, due to high tides from storms,  but I'd love one fairly close with a path to the beach. I never have left  the ocean without always feeling more invigorated and in general, just  healthier, than when I arrived. I guess there is something to that fresh  salt sea air. Of course, in the winter, there are storms and with it,  trees do blow down, highways get blocked, and often beach towns-  people may be stuck for days until the road crews come on the scene  to clear away the debri. But I wouldn't have to live there in the winter.  I could have a place in the city for fall and winter, and then live at the  beach for spring and summer. Having the best, of both worlds.     Where you live, sounds very tranquil and ideal. I  would assume  that you live a stress free existance there and that all of the nature  scenes that you enjoy, help to free your soul and give you a complete  sense of happiness. I know a man who lives an idealic lifestyle in such  a  place, on an island off the coast of England. And there is much for  him to see when he takes walks around the island. I didn't know that  there were seals along the coast of England. I thought they were only  found on the western coast of the states. So we can learn new things  about places as well as from other people.    You mention the sound of distant church bells. I used to hear them  as a child. But where I live now, in another location, there never are  bells ringing on a Sunday morning.  Maybe in small towns they still  observe tradition. But I do miss hearing them today.      Thank you for allowing us a sneak peek at your environment. It  sounds very appealing.|`|55a9783c458dd93738b7846d66a04e04aa	A small single-story (non-cookie cutter type) ranch house out in the middle of the desert at least one hour away from any city or other home, no more than two hours away close to a nearby general store. I would love to own about 25+ acres give or take. The house would be large but cozy and the yards big. A huge fenced in backyard with lots of dogs. A big porch surrounding the entire house to watch the sunsets and sunrises from as well as any rain or lightning storms. A small pond with lots of fish, turtles and ducks and a bench to sit on. 15-20 miles from a lake. Maybe a small vegetable or herb garden. Of course full utilities, water, sewer, garbage, gas, electricity, and central a/c and central heat. Lots of ceiling fanlights.    It has to have miles and miles of land as far as the eye could see. At night, it would have full access to the clear night sky to view all the stars. A small indoor pool and jacuzzi, living room, movie room, library with lots of books, well-sized kitchen and a viewing room for the night sky that has a clear glass ceiling in case I didn't feel like going outside. Of course a small gym/work out room and a recreational room with a pool table and darts. Nice cozy bedroom.    All in all, it'd probably cost about 10-15 million to make this type of home a reality. I'm literally dirt poor, so it's never going to happen, but a man can dream, can't he?  : ^ )|`|b8d900734a417c873cfba7eca8796d7daa	cottage|`|7oYUan7zaa	a high rise luxury apartment or penthouse in the center of dubai city, or a big house in a suburb of kuala lumpur like petaling jaya..

Have huge walk-in closets, bright sunny rooms, bathrooms with huge vanities, a kitchen with a wine rack and desk, a nice deck or patio I can eat out on,  a nice open floor and traffic pattern, and right near a restaurant, so I don't have to cook all the time.|`|0HfrBEBJaa	the house I am in now is pretty dreamy for me . It's a whare house---a large shed. I am removing the front and back walls as they are metallic(corrugated iron) and replacing with 3 meter panels of hebel. Each weighs nearly 100kg so quite a job----my partner does most of the work ----I help. We invested in a chain winch to raise the higher ones  as the shed has a saw tooth roof and is over 3 mt high. On one side we have built areas to house our living accommodation a large bedroom/ lounge each. Our outside area with glass doors from our rooms has many trees and a large pond in which we are planning to grow water lilies so eventually it will really be dreamy but probably then we will move yet again.|`|f3a7be84fd421afa186951f7172f516caa	Hi,you have touched on a subject that is dear to my heart.my 2 sisters and I want to find some property in western nc,and put 3 small houses on it.I have done a lot of looking online and after all is said and done,I like tiny houses very well. cusato cottages which were designed to replace Katrina victim fema trailers are PERFECT.you can get the plans and the materials package from lowes, they have plans from about 300 sqft to 1800 sqft. NO I dont work for lowes, lol. I just actually found exactly the house I want, is all. there are more than enough giant houses in this country.|`|nmHvo9MLaa	I like the sound of your dream house very much. So my answer is the same except for one thing. Instead of the little cottage, I want a great big one with an infinite number of rooms. I would hope to fill it with all the people I love. I would like to live among them and share the same hearth with them. I would want it to be an ever-growing community, knitted together with unconditional love. (With enough room to go off and sulk for a while sometimes 'cos we're talking about humans after all.)  In short.....  ~A place where there would always be room for one more.~    Have a great holiday Denisbabes x|`|TrBZvXfzaa	I love this question...because I always observe houses and dream about having the perfect one...just like you!

b4d182ebaeb01ace50b4f0280b18a44faa	Generally, I would have to say yes - simply because I don't run across many people who follow the evidence for what they believe as far as they can and establish a trustworthy foundation.  Instead, I see a lot of people who merely believe in things because they were either told by their parents it's true or fell for the "if you don't believe, you're going to be tormented for eternity" bit.... sometimes it's both.  There are a lot of things within the different religions that one can provide proof for.   We just can't prove that any Gods exist.  *wink*|`|39NXJwAEaa	Yes.|`|aub4VI7aaa	PERHAPS... What do you belive?|`|j193j6vmaa	Faith is not about feelings. Its beyond emotions and logical arguments.   But because faith is looked at from an emotional perspective,many Christians contradict themselves in what they believe vs. their actions.|`|56Pffg2Saa	When a person weighs up everything, he will realise that something is missing. He will ask himself: What is the explanation for this life; what is the purpose of living? This is where FAITH begins. He will realise that there must be some great mysterious power behind existence, something which controls the harmony and sequence of events; something behind the mere dust and materialism of this world|`|fdd829938c07d94d14fd05d7f4292551aa	No, no not at all. Feelings are emotions, faith is what you believe. You can believe something true or completely false. Feelings have nothing to do with it.    If you believe Jesus in John 3:3, you will really understand where most will not.

It's no wonder either speaks of it in their campaign speeches. They  want to avoid taking a stand publically. Secrets even before they  reach the White House? Isn't that the norm for many past presidents?  I'd like to see someone with more than an honest face as our leader.  I'd like someone who is honest on the inside too.

I will say that after all the crap I've read and heard this past week about the dirty little tricks being pulled by the camp of the candidate who is currently behind in the polls, I'm beyond sick of all the campaigning.  A McCain volunteer claims someone carves a B on her face then admits that she made up the story the next day.  Now a conspiracy group claims that Obama was not born in the US.  How much lower can people stoop.  It's totally beyond my comprehension.  I listened to a nationally syndicated talk show today out of Cincinnati and the host allowed a man to say that the Democrats were going to start taking money for Medicare out of his Social Security check next month and he was outraged over this.  Hello people medicare has been deducted from SS checks for quite a while.  The host just went right along with him and never attempted to correct this misconception.  I've turned off my radio and I'm tuning out until after the election.  Okay friends my rant is over and I feel much better now.|`|AA11028702	I'm out again.  Abstain.

The younger teenage/young adults also accept it, mainly because thier friends are also gay or lesbian.

FhFgX6tiaa	Greetings,  My group (Loxley Abbey Church) practices Medieval Style Paganism, which incorporates the Pagan medieval practices of the remote peasant villagers blended with the Christian teachings of the Church.  As an example,, We will celebrate Midsummer & St. John's Day. Because the Church converted Pagan holidays & Gods to Christian it is easy to blend both.  St. John had rustic temples build & was sometymes pictured with horns. St. Francis protector of animals is natural Pagan.  How about St. Cathrines Wheel the symbol of the Solstice? Pagan Wells were renamed with Saint in front of the Pagan Gods name.   There are many ways to honour the Pagan ways whilst blending in Christian practices. We also have Pagan Baptism.  It is easy to blend the two just as the Medieval Church blended Paganism with Christianity in order to make the transition easier. Pagans can do it in reverse. :)  I personally like to discuss the true teachings of Jesus. Not what the Bible says but what I beleive he said. Like to live your life as a honest, harding working, sharing person. Not to kill, harm or harass people who believe differently from you. To show your beliefs by the way you act.  That's it from me. Thanks.  Wassail,  Samantha L. Heart|`|7YhoMfWkaa	I've heard of people combining the two religions together.  Witchvox.com usually has a few articles at a time about the subject.  I know that many Christians all over the world have practiced witchcraft while holding their Christian beliefs, but using witchcraft (which is a tool/technique, not a religion itself) and believing in pagan tenants are different.      For me, the combination of the Christian belief and the Pagan belief is too difficult to work out.  Pagan beliefs could make it work, but Christian beliefs condemn Pagan ones all around.    Many Pagans would say to a Christian-Wiccan or, as you call it, a Christo-Pagan (I like that term, rolls off of the tongue) that they are just holding onto their old Christian beliefs in fear, and that they need to make a decision on their beliefs one way or another. I remember when I "came home" to Paganism, I was scared to shake off the Catholicism I was raised with.  I held fast to Mary (admittedly, not so fast to Jesus,... I dropped him almost instantly), and did alot of research.  I went from Mary, to Mary of Magdalene, to Sophia,  and outward and onward.  Eventually, I shook off Christianity as something that was there, another facet of the great big jewel that is The Ultimate, but something that I generally don't agree with, nor enjoy.      I'm not saying that other people can't enjoy practicing Pagan and Christian beliefs together, but for me, after doing the research, reading the bible, taking the classes, I find that the two don't really mix, and I was much happier picking one.|`|5qcdEswRaa	It's possible to mix Christianity and Paganism, though doing so will probably get you shut out of both groups.  The major stumbling block in mixing the two lies with the Christian side of things.  Since Jesus said "no one comes to the father except through me" back in the book of John, it makes worshipping other gods sort of difficult.    However, if you take a more open and gnostic approach to Christianity the two mix decently well.  The Gnostic Christian universe is full of gods, both male and female, and Judeo-Christian myth is full of divine figures that you can use in worship.    If you choose to worship in a Wiccan-inspired way, you can use angels to mark the four cardinal points, and use either Mary Magdalene or Mary the Mother of Jesus as your "Goddess" figure.  Obviously Jesus would be worshipped as "The God," even if he doesn't have horns (at least crown of thorns rhymes with horns).    When it comes to "beliefs," I know dozens of Christians who hold the natural world to be sacred, just like Pagans.  Respect for the earth should be a universal.|`|AA11956449	in my opinion most of them have an intrest in the so called Occult. like tarot cards or fortune telling. and use the excuese that their beliefs or gifts (in some cases) come from god. because they are either too scared to tell their family, or too fearful of the christian hell, to admit (even to themselves) that they need more from their religion.|`|AA12003094	well what you are describing is an oxymoron. There can be no true Christian Wiccan in any form - there can be false or anti-christian wiccan, but there can not be Christian Wiccan, the same with Christo-paganism!|`|7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	Wiccans follow the Rede (pronounced "Reed") which simply put is "An' it Harm None, Do What Thou Wilst".  In other words, do what you want as long as it doesn't harm anyone or anything.  Wicca is an earth-based religion.

46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	The Catholic church tried to keep the bible secret.  They would not allow their people to read the bible.  If they were caught reading it, they were burned at the stake with the bible chained around their neck.  They would never have their sermons in the language of the people.  Check it out in your history books. Many people in Governments tried to get rid of the bible.  They burned all of the ones they could find.  People who were caught translating the bible were either killed or exiled.    It was in Constantines time( the founder of the Catholic church)that Christendom as we know it today began to take shape. From then on, the degenerate form of Christianity that had taken root was no longer just a religious organization. It was a part of the state, and its leaders played an important role in politics. Eventually, the apostate church used its political power in a way that was completely opposed to Bible Christianity, introducing another dangerous threat to the Bible. How?     When Latin died out as an everyday tongue, new translations of the Bible were needed. But the Catholic Church no longer favored this. In 1079 Vratislaus, who later became king of Bohemia, asked the permission of Pope Gregory VII to translate the Bible into the language of his subjects. The popes answer was no. He stated: It is clear to those who reflect often upon it, that not without reason has it pleased Almighty God that holy scripture should be a secret in certain places, lest, if it were plainly apparent to all men, perchance it would be little esteemed and be subject to disrespect; or it might be falsely understood by those of mediocre learning, and lead to error.     The pope wanted the Bible to be kept in the now-dead tongue of Latin. Its contents were to be kept secret, not translated into the languages of the common people. Jeromes Latin Vulgate, produced in the 5th century to make the Bible accessible to all, now became a means of keeping it hidden.     As the Middle Ages progressed, the Churchs stand against vernacular Bibles hardened. In 1199 Pope Innocent III wrote such a strong letter to the archbishop of Metz, Germany, that the archbishop burned all the German-language Bibles he could find. In 1229 the synod of Toulouse, France, decreed that lay people could not possess any Bible books in the common tongue. In 1233 a provincial synod of Tarragona, Spain, commanded that all books of the Old or New Testament be handed over to be burned. In 1407 the synod of clergy summoned in Oxford, England, by Archbishop Thomas Arundel expressly forbade the translating of the Bible into English or any other modern tongue. In 1431, also in England, Bishop Stafford of Wells forbade the translating of the Bible into English and the owning of such translations.     These religious authorities were not trying to destroy the Bible. They were trying to fossilize it, keep it in a language that only a few could read. In this way, they hoped to prevent what they called heresy but what really amounted to challenges to their authority. If they had succeeded, the Bible could have become just an object of intellectual curiosity, with little or no influence in the lives of ordinary people.|`|AA12002954	The Bible does not have the answers...dont be silly|`|0add0ebc7e950155d4e120d651fb208faa	Your additions give you part of the answer.

The Bible, as we know it, did not come into existence until after Luther challenged the Catholic Church's ignorance of the perceived scriptural authority.|`|AA11944716	The apostle Paul very clearly wrote that "all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work." (2 Timothy 3:16, 17)    2 Peter 1:20,21 "For YOU know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation.  For prophecy was at no time brought by mans will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit."    If you went to the trouble to have a guidebook written to guide your family to you, would you allow your enemies to destroy it? or keep it away from them indelinately?  Certainly not.  Neither has God.    The Bible   ~ Cherished and Suppressed   ~ A Textbook for Living  http://www.watchtower.org/library/w/2000...

El que se suicida por honor lo cual pude ser valido o no, ya que depende en que circunstancias se encuentra para tomar la decisin de quitarse la vida.    Algo que si es cierto y por suerte la Iglesia catlica ya no condena a los suicidas ya que es a consecuencia de un mundo confundido y contaminado.

b649b2c242d29081ef78753e78626603aa	Le fran?ais parl par les qubquois et les acadiens, qu'on oublie tout le temps ceux-l, est du fran?ais du XVIIe sicle, comme on le parlait en France. C'est  cette poque que beaucoup de fran?ais ont migr vers le nouveau monde ; pour le Poitou, 300 d'entre eux, emmens par Menou d'Aulnay, qui a quasiment vid 3 villages prs de chez moi, avec la bndiction de Richelieu.       Par opposition  l'anglais, pour avoir souvent t "malmens" par ceux qui le parlaient, les descendants des Fran?ais du Qubec et de l'Acadie, n'emploient aucun anglicisme dans le fran?ais qu'ils parlent et ont "invent" quelques mots particuliers comme "des claques" pour les plastiques que l'on met au-dessus des chaussures en hiver par exemple.        Dans leur obstination  parler un fran?ais le plus prs possible de l'origine, Ils sont plus courageux que les fran?ais de France, qui passent leur temps, eux,   massacrer joyeusement leur propre langue !

C'est seulement du fran?ais qui a volu un peu sparment. D'un c?t les Fran?ais ont invent de nouveaux mots, de nouvelles expressions, certaines tournures qui ne sont jamais arrives au Qubec, et dans le mme temps les Qubcois ont invent leurs propres nouveauts linguistiques qui ne sont jamais arrives en France. Il n'y a donc pas un fran?ais plus mauvais que l'autre, ils sont juste diffrents. Et il n'y en a pas un plus vieux que l'autre non plus, les deux sont diffrents du fran?ais qui tait parl  l'poque o les futurs Qubcois ont migr de France...  Et finalement on se comprend encore assez bien, non ?|`|LPvVkY5baa	Bonjour,    En fait il faut distinguer deux chose : la structure grammaticale et le vocabulaire d'une part et l'accent qubcois d'autre part.    Concernant le premier, il est vrai que les qubcois ont gard une certaine "puret" des mots, par exemple aux carrefours, tu vois le mot "Arrt" et pas "Stop", mais il faut reconna?tre que compte tenu de l'envahissement de l'anglais et de la monte de la nouvelle gnration bilingue, il y a de nouveaux anglicismes que l'on n'a pas en France : tips au lieu de pourboire par exemple. Du point de vue grammaticale, pas de diffrence.    Par contre, en ce qui concerne l'accent, c'est un grand mystre, car il ne ressemble  aucun autre accent de la France et je doute fort que les fran?ais parlaient avec cet accent-l au 17me sicle. en revanche, il y a une explication de la particularit de leur accent : les qubcois n'articulent PAS. Ils ouvrent la bouche au minimum, comme pour viter de se fatiguer... par exemple, ils prononcent "o", beaucoup de "a" de francais classqiue  : tu entends des "rots" au lieu des "rats"...effectivement le mouvement de la bouche pour prononcer un "o" est beaucoup moindre que le "a".    Parfois, j'ai l'impression que les Britannqiues devraient avoir la mme opinion de l'anglais amricain, que les fran?ais de l'accent qubcois.    Mecri    @alex : ne sois pas susceptible inutilement, et laisse les autres s'exprimer sur ce qu'ils "entendent"...la langue est juste un moyen d'expression, elle ne reflte pas la valeur d'une culture. Ne pas en faire une cause de discorde.|`|s6fcCYUBaa	je suis en dsaccord avec joub. Les Qubcois ne remplacent pas les sons a par o, c'est totalement absurde.

Notre fran?ais est s?rement du vieux fran?ais puisque nous l'avons mieux conserv que vous. Du mauvais fran?ais??? Qui est bien plac pour dire cela?

0f1cf8f6280a297a38626ad190595f2baa	La constitution de la 5me rpublique a t con?ue pour le Gnral De Caulle par Jean Louis Debr  la fin des annes 50, en 1962 l'adoption de l'lection du prsident de la rpublique au suffrage universel a dfinitivement consacr la pminence du prsident sur le parlement, il dsigne le 1er ministre qui forme un gouvernement responsable devant l'assemble nationale, le prsident lui n'est responsable que devant le peuple. De Gaulle lui  avait une haute ide de cette responsabilit et aprs un rfrendum perdu il est parti  la fin des annes 60.  J Chirac n'a pas eu la dignit d'en faire autant, dommage pour le pays.  Il a fait ramener le mandat du prsident  5 ans la mme dure que pour les dputs, ce faisant, il a semble-t-il fait du prsident qui auparavant tait dtach des partis,une sorte de super 1er ministre et il a  dtruit ce qui faisait l'originalit de la 5me rpublique, rgime qui tait assez subtilement prsidentiel et parlementaire  la fois. Une autre particularit de la 5me est d'exclure le scrutin propotionnel, le scrutin majoritaire  2 tours favorise la constitution de majorit franche et durable et a vit l'instabilit gouvernementale qui avait t la plaie de la 4me rpublique, la proportionnelle favorisant l'miettement des partis et tout un systme d'alliances et de contre alliances qui se nouaient et se dfaisaient au gr des ambitions des uns ou des autres.

d86397c5741ce75598fa744b94b9a6bbaa	When I did the vegetarian thing for a year (I went through a PETA phase when I was 13), I found myself very judgemental of others who ate meat.  I also found other vegetarians to be just as judgemental as I was.  I felt as though I had more self-control and willpower than meat-eaters, and honestly, it wasn't really about "saving animals".  It was an ego-trip, the same as anorexia.    I stopped the veggie diet after a year because I just became too malnourished.

Not having the meat in my diet made me anemic all the time given my genetic condition so my doctors asked me, not ordered me, to have a diet balanced with meat again.  I do eat meat but not a lot, just enough to keep me from being anemic.|`|e9ac3f47dd3d413181661caa41c44562aa	Some do, especially really hardcore vegans, but most people are non-judgmental.|`|AA10781920	Why worry about it, what are they gonna do?

QTJMHy3Faa	.......What are you talking about? If people do these things then you talk to an adult, you don't bring harm to yourself. In all reality there's no such thing as 'emo' 'n there's aren't any real goths left either, except myself 'n possible 1 or 2 other people.    What exactly is 'emo'? Wearin' black 'n cutin' yourself? Please. Grow up. Why would anyone want to fall into a label, anyway? More-or-less put themselves there...    I don't believe this is even a question, because if it was then you wouldn't even be this, 'emo' thing you clam to be. You wear black 24/7? Yeah your right, so what? Believe it or not, the cloths don't make the man. Or in your case, woman.    If your so sick of life 'n these people, then be smart enough to take the right actions. Which are not to inflict harm onto yourself, but to talk to an adult. You have parents, do you not? You have teachers, correct?    Grow up. Stop talking about it if it doesn't bother you. Take the right course of action. Don't put yourself into a label. Don't think that 'emo' is even real. Schools suck because of these labels, you've learned this first hand. But you still just let it be... Your willing to let another young girl go through exactly what your going through now, but your not willing to do a coursed thing about it...

Puisque tu tudies le fran?ais, je te rpondrai qu'en fran?ais sauf pour quelques prcisions.   Que devons-nous comprendre par "bagne" ??? En effet, un 'bagne' = a penal colony/convict prison.   S'agit-il de "(se) baigner" = (to) have a bath ??? Si oui, dans ce cas prcis, "se baigner" est un verbe 'pronominal rflchi' (je me baigne, tu te baignes ...) et doit se conjuguer avec l'auxiliaire "tre" ; donc au pass compos on dira : "je me SUIS baign(e)", tu t'es baign(e), il s'est baign/elle s'est baigne, nous nous sommes baign(e)s, vous vous tes baign(e)s, ils se sont baigns/elles se sont baignes ...

AA12392758	People in Mexico have a similar question about how US citizens refer to themselves as Americans.    There are three terms that people in Mexico call US citizens Americanos (Americans), Norteamericanos (North Americans), and Estadounidense (United Statians)    For one, it feels unfair for US citizens to call themselves Americans since Mexico is also part of the continent of the Americas.    Secondly, it also feels unfair to call US citizens Northamericans since Mexico is also part of North American.    Thirdly, calling US citizens United Statians would be unfair since Mexico's offical name is Estados Unidos Mexicanos or United Mexican States.    I think it is quite egotistical for people to label themselves as "Americans" but most do not do it consciously. However, Xok is a good example of one who does so.     Honestamente, los estadounidense, americanos, norteamericanos, lo que sean siempre son individuales. Algunos son unos pendejos como Xok, otros no. Pero la mayoria, si son pendejos y nosotros no podemos hacer nada porque los pendejos, aunque son ricos, pobres, blancos o ******, nunca cambiaran. Y asi es la vida.|`|AA10781920	We didn't.

Yes, we know "Americans" is not geographically correct.  But when your country is named "The United States of America," the options for a proper adjective are not great.  What would you have us call ourselves, "United Statesians"?|`|76a977eaaee6cac237d478652a48e522aa	Wrong again, my little guacho friend.    To say "President of America" is absolutely correct.     There is no conflict in naming a country AMERICA. It would be like complaining to the school because my daughter isn't the only "Mary" in the class.    North America, South America, American continent, and....    The country of AMERICA.    I'm an AMERICAN from AMERICA, and NO ONE will ever take that away from me.    Come on people! Show some pride! No one from another country gets to decide what our name is!  I don't care if they don't like it.    I'll never give up the name AMERICAN, not even at gun point.|`|h0XZLwQCaa	(i'm going to copy here what I wrote in the linked page in spanish, answering Xok:)    Amigo Xok:    Creo que nadie quiere que dejes el nombre de tu pas. Duende, el muchacho que hizo la pregunta tiene mucha razn. Creo que no es una cuestin de orgullo y que no es necesario que convoques partidarios para esta lucha, se trata de un planteo serio hecho pacficamente.    Como te deca, nadie pretende quitarte tu identidad o el nombre o el orgullo. Slo hay que admitir:  -El presidente de la Repblica de Venezuela se denomina formalmente "Presidente de la Repblica de Venezuela" o simplemente "...de Venezuela"  -El presidente de Los EEUU del Brasil se denomina "Presidente de los EEUU del Brasil" o "... de BRasil"  -Entonces por qu el Presidente de los EEUU de Norteamrica ha de autollamarse "Presidente de Amrica"?    Yo creo que la palabra "Amrica" no tiene formalmente tal doble acepcin a la que tu te refieres. Amrica es un continente y solo eso. Por ello es que tu pas se llama "...DE Amrica" (perteneciente a Amrica). Y por eso, mientras que s es correcto que Brasil use slo la ltima palabra de su nombre oficial, no es correcto que uds. usen slo la ultima palabra del suyo, porque es agresivo.    Me parece brbaro que tengas orgullo. Yo tengo mi orgullo de ser venezolana y seguro Duende siente orgullo de ser argentino. Ahora bien, qu diras t si Brasil comenzara a llamarse ante el mundo "Estados Unidos". No lo consideraras un poco injusto? PUes an ms razn tiene el resto de Amrica de sentirse sensible por este problema.    No hay ese doble significado de "Amrica", as como no es que la bandera de EEUU sea considerada tambin bandera mundial y por eso est clavada en la luna. Nada de eso. Hay una intencin de tu pas de tomar el nombre de un territorio mucho mayor, as como de clavar la propia bandera en la luna.    Y creo que ese mismo orgullo agresivo del que hablo es el mismo que te impulsa a escribir a t. LO ves? ME animo a adentrarme un poco ms y decir que no hay tanta diferencia entre lo que t hiciste (apelar al orgullo, agrandar el problema y reunir gente para combatir usando como mensaje el orgullo nacional) y lo que hace Bush al convocar una guerra. Pinsalo, es casi lo mismo.    No busques un nuevo nombre para tu pas, nadie pide eso. TOdo lo que pide quien hizo la pregunta, y yo, y creo que toda Amrica (el continente, claro est), es que tengan una gota de sensibilidad al respecto.    Gracias.

69755bf80032a14276b76226d108000daa	The Bible doesn't say in so many words that Christians are now the chosen people.  It does say that the old covenant (Old Testament) would be replaced and that salvation would be for all people Jews and Gentiles.      "Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and  with the house of Judah - not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt (Jeremiah 31:31,32). The New Law would be different from the Old.  Jeremiah spoke these words 900 years after the Law was given at Mt. Sinai and 600 years before Christ gave the New Law.     What happened to the Old Testament (the Old Law, or Old Covenant)?  The New Testament tells us, "In that He says, 'A new covenant,' He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away" (Hebrews 8:13). "For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law made nothing perfect..."  (Hebrews 7:18,19). "Then He said, 'Behold, I have come to do Your will, 0 God.' He takes away the first that He may establish the second"  (Hebrews 10:9). "For the priesthood being changed, of necessity, there is also a change of the law" (Hebrews 7:12).  The apostle Paul wrote:  "Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements  (the Law of Moses)  that  was  against us, which was contrary to us, And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross" (Colossians 2:14).  Paul also wrote concerning this Old Law which contained the Ten Commandments: "Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor" (Galatians 3:24, 25).    Today, all people have the promise of salvation if they follow God's commands.  These commands apply to all people.  Those that follow these commands are added to the church once they are baptized and are therefore called Christians.|`|c6ce160c3eeb122051c292fe361fb826aa	But see the reason the jews are no longer the chosen people are because they do not believe that Jesus is Gods son. And through Jesus we can have a personall relationship with God. praise the lord!!! :)|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	God promised Abraham that his lineage (the Jews) would be his chosen people and God NEVER goes back on his word. So the even today the Jews are the chosen people, but since they denied Christ, our (the gentiles) salvation is assured when we accept Jesus.|`|HkILmHHMaa	I think it depends on who you ask ;)    The Old Testament view is that the Hebrews are the Chosen People of God - he chose them to give his message/rules.  When Jesus came, he basically spread the message to the masses, regardless of being a Jew, Roman, etc.      Christians are descendants of Jews.  We're all "People of the Book," as so eloquently put in the Koran.|`|AA11113550	The Jews will always be Gods choosen people. the very first Christians were in fact Jews.  But the Christian Gentiles are now also Gods people and was grafted in. See Romans 11.|`|AA11047076	Since the Jews don't believe in anything not contained in the Tanach (what you refer to as the old testament), Jews believe as they always.  Christians obviously believe otherwise- that is why Judaism and Christiuanity are different religions.|`|26896be25b9fe83bcef7859a07b98f01aa	The Catholic Church acknowledges that the Jews are God's Chosen People.|`|3db8015e16fe6ef4ba70aff43c92e33aaa	I can't speak for protestant christians, but in the Catholic faith, we recognize our roots back to Judaism.  Because of this, we are also His chosen people.  I still believe that the Jews are still His chosen people, but that Christians are now too.

3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Hmm...it depends on the day.  Sometimes it's just no big deal.  Other times, my thirst for knowledge gets the best of me and I really want to know the answer.    I guess the most important and fun thing about it all is the search.  It will be kind of disappointing when I get the answer.|`|ee02416c1f7040a0cd9324386e41f61eaa	You don't sound agnostic, which is sometimes quite a firm belief that perfect knowledge is impossible so bold claims one way or the other are meaningless. You sound what would be described as a-religious. That's fair enough. As for your question, I'm perfectly happy with what I believe.

But at the moment, I cannot see myself surrendering to a religion nor to another human beings organization and/or philosophies.|`|4e4c5695421681f6dae3efe7315898bcaa	I do not really concern myself with whether there is a god or not anymore.  For a long time I believed that there was NO god but my assurance has softened over the years.  I am more interested now in wondering why some people have such delusional beliefs about god and religion.  I am studying the early origins of christianity and I can tell you that the more I learn the more I wonder how anyone can believe such crap.  I am convinced that all christian persons in this country are insane, incredibly ignorant, or both.  Monotheism is a disease!  I am far more sympathetic to the eastern and pagan religions of the earth.|`|5KLx4su2aa	i so just had this argument with someone else. they claimed there was no such thing as agnostic on it's own.    i used to be fully agnostic and now i'm atheist, though i am more on the agnostic side of atheist. i can't claim to KNOW unequivocally 100% whether or not there is a god or gods. no one can claim this. but i believe that there isn't. if something ever happens to challenge that belief, i will welcome it and consider it. but honestly, it's not that important to me (except when it comes to debating existence vs. non-existence)|`|7d1154433df2ad2c1bb31e761617e1caaa	Like Crystall I was agnostic at one point and am now Atheist. That's a question you should answer for yourself. I feel a lot better having a "religon" rather than being Agnostic.|`|PeYiVoeoaa	I too was at one time exactly as you and before that atheist and before that was bible stuffed.    Nothing can sway a person. Sometimes belief must be suspended in a way.    Then we see the extraordinary. The path that we have traveled and those curious co-incidences that are beyond the simple explanation of chance.    Particularly when there is a see-able chain of these leading to an event or meeting that changes or sets a course in our life.    Agnostic - "A" meaning without or not or no (kinda like prefixes un or in) and "gnostic" from gnosis which is Greek for knowledge.    Agnostic simply means "without knowledge" of a god or gods.    I have found that many well studied people are still without knowledge. Some of these will say this with great humility or anger saying; "I don't know".    Many of the Christians I know say they are still learning. This is stating; "I have incomplete knowledge" and is not the same as saying; "I have no knowledge".

1c59c463fc32eab015c352e5bcc5687daa	Per polizia si intende un generico corpo istituzionale preposto alla tutela dell'ordine pubblico contro gli attentati che questo potrebbe patire dalla condotta illegale di alcuni individui o da eventi fortuiti, che minerebbero appunto la sicurezza pubblica. Tipicamente una polizia dedica una quota maggioritaria delle proprie attivit alla prevenzione ed alla repressione del crimine, ma in genere vi  sempre anche una parallela funzione di pubblico soccorso per situazioni di emergenza.    Quasi tutti gli ordinamenti nazionali degli stati moderni prevedono l'istituzione e l'impiego di corpi di polizia, con differenziazioni che tengono conto delle relative specificit culturali (ed eventualmente anche religiose - ad esempio in regimi di teocrazia) e giuridiche. Le polizie sono gli enti precipuamente delegati a ricevere le funzioni di polizia e ad assolvervi.    L'Arma dei Carabinieri  una delle quattro Forze Armate - unitamente all'Esercito Italiano, alla Marina Militare Italiana ed all'Aeronautica Militare Italiana. Per via della sua doppia natura di forza armata e forza di polizia le sono devoluti compiti militari, concorrendo alla difesa della Patria, partecipando alle operazioni militari in Italia e all'estero, esercitando le funzioni di polizia militare, garantendo la sicurezza delle Rappresentanze Diplomatiche italiane all'estero, e di polizia, nel cui ambito esercita funzioni di polizia giudiziaria e di pubblica sicurezza.|`|xn4T76pgaa	Credo che sia soprattutto un problema logistico,nelle grandi citt ci sono molti posti di polizia e molte caserme di carabinieri quindi si chiama indifferentemente una o l'altra dell forze dell'ordine,nel territorio per,se ci fai caso le questure e quindi i posti di polizia sono molto meno presenti,mentre una caserma dei carabinieri  presente in ogni paese o quasi (dove abito io ci sono i carabinieri ma il posto di polizia pi vicino  a 30 km.),quindi in caso di bisogno chiami chi  pi vicino per accorrere prontamente.|`|vmHF0153aa	se subisci un furto vai dai carabinieri, se  ti capita un incidente vai dalla polizia, perlomeno arrivano prima. ciao|`|R6QzgITCaa	i carabinieri fanno parte dell'esercito italiano... la polizia  un corpo a s...  io personalmente chiamerei la polizia perch non nutro tanta simpatia verso i carabinieri dopo qualche evento trascorso...|`|9ThdoYkpaa	Quando c' emergenza non bado a chi chiamare, ma chiamo direttamente!|`|4z4Vup9kaa	se hai bisogno di un pronto intervento  indifferente.  chiamando il 113 o il 112 la richiesta viene inoltrata ad una sala operativa ke ti smista poi verso il presidio di carabinieri o polizia + vicino al luogo dell'emergenza.  La polizia a differenza dei carabinieri si occupa della pubblica sicurezza x es con il mantenimento dell'ordine pubblico nelle manifestazioni di piazza,negli stadi,ecc.  I carabinieri invece sono impegnati a differenza della polizia in missioni militari.  Per il resto se hai bisogno puoi rivolgerti indifferentemente all'uno o all'altro.  Infine,la polizia fa capo al ministero dell'interno mentre i carabinieri sono militari e fanno capo al ministero della difesa|`|vjc7cG7aaa	:P me lo sono sempre chiesta anche io quale differenza ci fosse,ma ancora non l'avevo scoperta!Comunque io chiamo i carabinieri, per il semplice motivo che nella mia valle ci sono solo quelli..|`|TZ0MWQJiaa	te chiama il 112 poi carabinieri o polizia....!
dd3ce1f496545bc8b288fb224b352ab1aa	One of the best known instances of praising God joyfully is David praising and dancing before the ark of the Lord....and David was called as a man after God's heart...    Just imagine the king of all Israel dancing before the common man....in those days, it was considered a disgrace for a king to run....and David danced with ALL HIS MIGHT......dont you think God was pleased with David? :)    We also have Miriam praising and dancing after the Lord the Israelites from the pursuing Egyptians.....    so nothing wrong with lifting up your hands....its cool to jump, dance and leap when you worship our awesome savior    God bless you    2Samuel 6:13  And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.    2Sameul 6:14  And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.    2Samuel 6:15  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.     2Samuel 6:16  And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.    Here are some references to dancing and praising God...    Psalms 149:2-4  Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.     Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.     For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.     Psa 150:3-4  Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.     Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.|`|9e468cab7ead15e03f2174cee26d0ffcaa	Psalm 96:1 (sing unto the Lord)    Psalm 150 (all of it! it talks about how to worship with many diff. instruments)    PSA 7:17  I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and   will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.    8:2  From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because   of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.    9:11  Sing praises to the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the   nations what he has done.    21:13  Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength; we will sing and praise your   might.    22:22  I will declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will   praise you.    23  You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor   him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!    25  From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before   those who fear you will I fulfill my vows.    24:7  Lift up your heads, O you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors,   that the King of glory may come in.    8  Who is this King of glory?

My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song.    30:4  Sing to the LORD, you saints of his; praise his holy name.    32:11  Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who   are upright in heart!    33:1  Sing joyfully to the LORD, you righteous; it is fitting for the   upright to praise him.    2  Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed   lyre.    3  Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy.    34:1  I will extol the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my   lips.    2  My soul will boast in the LORD; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.    3  Glorify the LORD with me; let us exalt his name together.    35:18  I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among throngs of   people I will praise you.    28  My tongue will speak of your righteousness and of your praises all day   long.    41:13  Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to   everlasting. Amen and Amen.    42:4  These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with   the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of   joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng.    43:3  Send forth your light and your truth, let them guide me; let them   bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.    4  Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight.

Awake, harp and lyre!

I dance, I sing, I rejoice, I lift my hands up to the heavens.    Look in psalms...it's all about rejoicing in praise.  Praise is just that.

AA11397626	Well, the words can change based on what they refer to, but I'll try...    for "pure" -- although pure water would use the word safi, I think you must mean something else which is "menyu."  You seem to be asking about the word in a religious sense.    for "unintelligible" -- the only translation I know of is to say that someone or something is unintelligible.  For you are unintelligible, it would be usioeleweka, for he/she it would be asioeleweka.    for "heavenly messenger" -- about the closest you will get there is the Swahili version of angel, and that is malaika.
75240d150282589885720ff70de6e772aa	Hola Diego, el fantasear puede ser parte de una relacion sexual placentera por ejemplo mientras estas haciendo el amor puedes fantasear con una y mil cosas inclusive la idea de que eres penetrado, hay parejas en donde la mujer asume la posicion de hombre y con ayuda de implementos comprados en la sex-shop ella es la que lo penetra, es cuestion de que te pongas de acuerdo con tu pareja, ahora bien, si lo que realmente quieres es tener una relacion de este tipo con otro hombre debes de pensarlo muy bien, por que despues de la primera vez no hay retorno, pero analiza detenidamente las implicaciones de esto, por ejemplo, quieres casarte o no? por que algo muy traumatico para una mujer es descubrir que te enganan con otro hombre, es algo que de verdad cuesta mucho manejar y los hijos si descubren el por que de la separacion de los padres, bueno ponte en ese lugar como reaccionarias, en fin, es demasiado sufrimiento para demasiadas personas solo por un rato de placer y te sorprendera que cuando lo hagas te resulte tan doloroso que despues te preguntes que cuernos estas haciendo alli, ademas del cielo a la tierra no hay nada oculto y si no eres lo suficientemente discreto pueden darse cuenta de tu doble vida, tu eres el unico que tiene la respuesta, pero evalualo con detenimiento y con mucho cerebro, la mente domina los instintos, tu eres el resultado de tus pensamientos no al reves, decide y que sea para bien.

Mucha suerte    http://www.enplenitud.com/v2notasxseccio...    Cmo actuar ante las fantasas homosexuales?    Un momento en el que la propia sexualidad es cuestionada y cualquier curso de accin parece complicado.          Muchas personas heterosexuales tienen fantasas con individuos de su mismo sexo, algunos inclusive han tenido encuentros en algn momento de sus vidas, sin que esto signifique que son homosexuales.      Las fantasas sexuales acompa?an el desarrollo de las personas y su crecimiento en materia sexual. Estas cambian a medida que los seres evolucionan o, en el mejor de los casos, las concretan abriendo la cabeza a un panorama de nuevas experiencias. As podemos separar a las fantasas en fases o perodos de tiempo durante el cual una fantasa predomina en la mente del individuo. Pero cuando un heterosexual comienza a fantasear con alguien de su mismo sexo, lo primero que se pregunta es si ser una etapa ms, y pasar con el tiempo, o si algo estar cambiando seriamente en su sexualidad. Pregunta para la que no hay respuesta inmediata.     Para quienes estn en pareja la situacin es ms complicada. Probablemente, sea conflictivo revelar fantasas homosexuales a la otra parte. Lo ms seguro es buscar ayuda en un consejero (profesional en lo posible) que no tenga conocimiento de los miembros involucrados. Es mejor hacer esto antes de tomar una decisin respecto de las fantasas (confesarlas o cumplirlas), arriesgando as lo menos posible a la pareja.     Por otra parte, puede que su novio o novia acepte concretar citas con otras personas, y de esta manera se podra explorar la fantasa sin enga?ar a la otra parte. En este caso, se debe tener en cuenta el riesgo de perder la pareja, ya que se la est exponiendo a encuentros sexuales con otras personas.     Para la gran mayora de las parejas, tener relaciones con una persona que no sea el compa?ero oficial es considerado un acto de traicin, al menos que a alguno de sus miembros le resulte indiferente que su par se relacione con otros (de cualquier sexo), sin consentimiento previo. Antes de hacer algo sin la aprobacin de su pareja, invierta los roles y pregntese qu pasara a la inversa.     De todos modos, hay parejas que tienen una relacin sexualmente abierta y acuerdan que cada miembro puede salir o tener sexo con otros. Frecuentemente invitan a otros individuos (o parejas) a tener relaciones con ellos, resultando estos encuentros muy placenteros para los participantes. Pero si uno o ms de los individuos aceptan participar en dichas travesuras para dar gusto o agradar a su otra parte (o an peor, si es forzado o manipulado para tener sexo), las consecuencias pueden ser muy dolorosas, tanto para los individuos como para la pareja.|`|0d4e6fabd16f0f1e01cd9237fd9093c9aa	Asmelo y atrevete a ser feliz.|`|5d1b346baded1c364bfc8ec2428bd20eaa	Aqui mas bien yo apuntara:  ?Qu es lo que t consideras como "normal"?

Non capisco il senso che dai a questa parola.   La usi in un contesto dove parli anche di perversione e i due termini a me non pare abbiano attinenze.   Lo dico perch essere "sofisticati" significa raffinati, sottili e non ha alcuna contrapposizione con "perversi" che significa volto al male, capace di fare del male.   Il contrario di "sofisticato" sarebbe, semmai, "rozzo", mentre quello di "perverso" sarebbe "buono, incline al bene".   Scusami per la puntualizzazione, ma temo che tu abbia posto male la domanda.   Comunque se intendi dire, pur sbagliando i termini, che le donne sono rozze tanto quanto gli uomini, sono d'accordo con te, ma in quanto ad inclinazioni al male sono a pari merito perch lo fanno gli uni e le altre, con la medesima disinvoltura.|`|ZsAMNM2Daa	Mica sempre....sono la nostra met,senza di loro che faremo?|`|HB4PMSDbaa	per conquistarvi!

7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	You are correct that the "y" in French refers to math.  In the second sentence, the "y" refers to the books written in jargon.     You can say, je ne comprends rien but that means "I don't understand anything" which doesn't directly refer to math or the books.  The whole idea of the pronoun "y" is that is refers to what was previously mentioned.    Hope that helps.|`|V54yLZBjaa	When you use "y", you can translate it by " cela" ( about ... )  I mean, tu parles des mathmatiques, je ne comprends rien  cela ( = aux mathmatiques )  I don"t understand about maths  Just for information ; for "en" like in j'en viens. It refers to the place where you come from.   I.e. Tu viens de la boulangerie ? Oui, j'en viens  I hope I helped you !!!
9f6145035ea01ea2c407cae99bafc561aa	The problem is that most liberal arts teachers tend to project their ideologies onto students.    Most students would rather pass than get a failing grade so they either adopt or at least accept their instructors viewpoint no matter how stupid.    Students who challenge their instructors viewpoint tend to receive failing grades.  The worst instructors will attempt to humiliate the student with opposing viewpoints ("Cho's" literature instructor for example) and should the student succeed in turning the humiliation back onto the instructor it can break down any class synergy, resulting in the instructor having a reduced capacity for instruction or the student who succeeds in humiliating the teacher can be ostracized by their fellow students.    As a result liberal arts tend to be self propagating garbage filled classes on pseudo-intellectual opinions.    In a science class a student can generally cite references in a debate comparing alternate theories, for example the theories of relativity and auto-dynamics.  Most science teachers, evolutionists excepted, do not treat their subject as if it were religion the way liberal arts and evolutionists do.    I would rather deal with well thought out research as opposed to the ridiculous trash I heard in literature and comparative religions classes.    As an obvious example I direct you to the posts by atheists who often end their posts with "the logical choice" or "the reasonable choice" when atheism is a closed minded and illogical rejection of evidence acceptable in any court that contradicts their opinion.    Now, if we can get a reasonable discourse during which people can exchange ideas, contradicting each other without attempting to humiliate or degrade each other I would welcome the idea.    Worse, some people feel humiliated and degraded when you state the obvious, atheists for example, because they would rather feel bad than accept that their idea was flawed and then rethink and redevelop their ideas.  They just get angry and pretend people who disagree with them do not exist.  The dreaded {B-D} "silent treatment".    After attending high school, college, reading yahoo answers and other boards I just do not believe it is possible to engage in an open minded and respectful discussion where people have widely contradicting ideas.    You can spend a short time among people with contradicting opinions, but, then you either adopt their ideology or you move on to other groups.    PS: Apathy is a result of conflict.  Too much conflict breeds apathy.  Conflict sells books and movies, stability and respect are required in education.  You don't find those things in liberal arts, politics, evolution or religious studies.|`|e19ukSO0aa	World Religions should be part of all public high school education. It is part of being an educated citizen in our society. Most people in this country have no idea what people of other religions believe in or the history behind other religions.     Religious ignorance is one of the reasons why there is prejudice, bigotry, and intolerance of other religions as well.    All Americans should know the core beliefs of all major world religions.|`|AA11907063	Yes, absolutely.    There is no reason for the ignorance people have about the world's religions.

But I'd be worried that the dominant religion of the school system would be the "religion" taught and the others would get, well, short shrift.  To use a religious term.    I studied religion in high school in history and literature classes, and it was a good course, taught about Greek and Roman and Babylonian stuff along with the Bible.  It's OK if it's treated like literature, but not if it's propaganda run by churches.    And lest you think I'm being paranoid, you oughta see some of the shenanigans pulled by "public schools" around where I live who have no sense of what the, "separation of church and state," means.|`|AA11479750	COMPARATIVE religionS! Yes, I would agree with that.|`|AA11278471	It's not as though these things aren't offered - I took comparative religions in college myself. The problem is getting people interested. There is a huge problem of apathy among kids today. They just don't seem to care. Not just about religious issues, but political ones as well.     I kind of wish that these things were mandatory - perhaps really studying and learning the different teachings of different religions would cut down on the amount of hatred.|`|AA10239241	Comparative religions wouldn't be a bad course to mandate.  It would have to be given by someone who could be highly objective, though and not start proselytizing.      Then again, imagine how long it would take to teach about Protestantism...there are new groups popping up every week!!!|`|AA10781920	I'm a militant agnostic, but I wouldn't have a problem with comparative theology. A broad course in the major world religions wouldn't be a bad thing.|`|8fa0f78f01aa9b4b95d1b104ae13e3d5aa	I could see a lot of benefit from teaching a genuinely balanced comparative relitions class.  It could indeed foster a more global, tolearant outlook if done correctly, but I feel the fears of others about such classes being "hijacked".  Perhaps studies in secular philosophy (eg, Aristotle, Locke, Descartes) are a "safer" means of obtaining the hoped-for intellectual growth.

vKny1QrWaa	Al primo posto c' Ges, poi la famiglia. Dio non ci chieder mai di uccidere un nostro figlio, poich quando ha chiesto ad Abramo di sacrificare suo figlio, Egli gi sapeva che Abramo, per fede, lo avrebbe fatto. Ma Dio, nella sua infinita bont, non lo avrebbe mai permesso; infatti non permise ad Abramo di uccidere suo figlio, anzi, con questo atto estremo di fede, Dio fece piovere tante di quelle benedizioni su Abramo, che nemmeno lui immaginava.

La storia di Adamo ed Eva non  che la presentazione in immagini del peccato originale. Basta leggere attentamente la genesi per vedere che neanche i redattori credevano nella storia letteralamente. Infatti vi sono all'interno diversi racconti della creazione contrastanti. Il primo in cui l'uomo viene creato per ultimo e il secondo in cui l'uomo viene creato per primo(questo  un'esempio). Il racconto biblico di Adamo ed Eva non  che una forma figurata di esprimere un concetto.   Dio ha creato tutto, e tutto era cosa buona e giusta, mentre l'uomo con il suo allontanamento da Dio ha causato il male. Ma nonostante il tradimento, Dio promette all'uomo che da una donna nascer colui il quale redimer l'umanit(il cosidetto protovangelo).  La genesi pertanto  un trattato di teologia espresso in maniera simbolica(simbologia che era chiara anche agli stessi autori, e quindi non frutto di una interpretazione successiva).

"Il 2000"  solo un mito dovuto all'accelerazione scientifica e tecnologica, ma non v' ragione di pensare che "nel 2000" dovrebbero essere tutti pi maturi (purtroppo..  solo una pia speranza). Anzi forse la crescita tecnologica aiuta la manipolazione delle masse attraverso i media (guarda quanto successo hanno i reality).   In ogni epoca c' sempre stata una parte di esseri umani che ha creduto nelle favole, e un'altra che ha saputo pi o meno discernere o che se n' del tutto disinteressata. Penso che sia fisiologico, finch non cambieranno del tutto le coscienze, che molti, pi fragili o pi suggestionabili, nella disperata ricerca di certezze cui aggrapparsi per far fronte a una vita esteriore che ne offre poche e che fa smarrire il proprio centro, abbiano creduto alle favole pi disparate, pi di moda, o pi facili.  la stessa base su cui si impiantano ideologie per le quali a milioni sacrificano la propria vita e che vanno poi puntualmente a finire negli interessi di pochi manipolatori.   Oggigiorno c' ancora gente che -crede- che la Terra sia piatta, oppure che il comandante galattico Xenu abbia fatto esplodere delle anime aliene (che ora ci 'possiedono') presso dei vulcani svariati milioni di anni fa (=Scientology), oppure che gli omosessuali non abbiano gli stessi diritti degli altri oppure che Berlusconi  un grande condottiero della libert.

Solo che qui il consorsio  la Chiesa. Il bello  che la Chiesa ha precisato che si tratta di metafore (ha dovuto farlo per le incongruenze scientifiche molto evidenti), ma non ne sono informati e continuano a lessarsi il cervello con la Bibbia. Se avessero letto un po' di storia delle religioni si sarebbero accorti che ogni popolo e civilt si  costruita una creazione del mondo secondo le concezioni dell'epoca. Cos la Bibbia  stata scritta con le concezioni dell'epoca che nulla sapeva della scienza, ma non  ammissibile perch allora sarebbe stata scritta da uomini. Ma il dibattito purtroppo  sterile, perch solo se gli parla la Chiesa nell'orecchio ascoltano. Gli dicono che il limbo non c' piu? Va bene. Gli dicessero, Papa & company, che occorre sputarsi sulle mani tutti i giorni per essere graditi a Dio lo farebbero, insomma ingoiano tutto, pure che i gay sono fuori esseri inferiori, che le donne non hanno pari natura umana degli uomini e che la fobia del sesso  purezza. Che ci vuoi fare, vivono fuori e non dentro, non sentono nulla dentro di s, e cercano solo un pastore che li guidi come un branco di pecore.

But PUNISHING someone for their BELIEFS?!!  Yes, being racist or prejudiced is based on someone's thought process much the same way as religion.

As long as he keeps that stuff inside or within other similar mindsets and doesn't hurt others (physically or verbally), why the hell do you care?

Sex is an action, there are many different types of sex:  sex for pleasure, sex for procreation, even hate sex is gratifying in some people's belief.  You do not have to be in love to have sex, just turned on by the person you are having sex with.   Love is an emotion.  There are people whom you love who you wouldn't think of having sex with is there not?  Do you love your parents, your children, your friends?  Do you show your love for them by having sex with them?  No, you don't.  However, in a relationship in which two people are lovers you can show your love and appreciation for them in the act of sex.  When true love turns into sex it isn't simply for the pleasure of having sex, its for the feeling of becoming one with the person you love. Most relationships don't last anymore because of this belief that sex is love then after a while when the partners are tired of sex with each other they have nothing left to hold on to.  That's why I believe that you should be with someone who not only stimulates you sexually but also mentally and emotionally in positive ways. I do agree that it is mostly women who think this way, mainly because women tend to be more emotional then men are.   I hope this helped you a bit!  ~*~Peace~*~|`|AA11371919	I have to have sex as a product of love, but I don't see them as the same thing.|`|4140e6d5bcf903804c09dbdd57fa30bdaa	No it is not the same  when you do it with your wife and with her consent only it is love  when you do it with someone else, say call grils, even with her consent, it is sex.
AA11047076	As others have said- it depends on which movement you convert through.  From the most lenient:  Reconstructionist and Reform  Since they allow conversion with very little formality their conversions are not accepted by the other movements.  They accept the rest.  Conservative/Masorti  More formal and requires some form of studying.  Their conversions are accepted by Reform and Reconstructionist but NOT by Orthodox Judaism.  Orthodox  This category would include Modern orthodox, Hasidim and Hareidim.  All three have extensive study requirements and have formal structures through which the conversion is done. The conversion has to be granted by a Beis Din (Rabbinical court).  Everyone accepts their conversions (In between the Orthodox sects conversions are recognised by other sects- the only argument sometimes being over the validity of a specific Jewish court, but if it is declared invalid, all the sects would recognise it as invalid.)    If you convert from one of the sects other than Orthodox, and want to convert to orthodox Judaism- you would first have to go through the formal process and show that you know enough of the Halakha (Jewish law) to be able to live life as an observant Jew.  Thus you would learn to read hebrew, follow the service in hebrew, the laws of Kashrut, of Shabbos, of Taharas Mishpacha (if married or soon to be married), and about the festivals and how to observe them.|`|379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	if you convert through Orthodox, then your pretty much safe to be counted jewish by the extreme mass majority of Jewish people.    if you convert through Reform, most probably will be dubious of it. or at least a large enough percentage that if you care, it could be a problem.    if you convert under Conservative... well, some will accept it, some won't.     you have to *really* mean it to convert to judaism though.     and by the way, in Judaism it is called converting. none of this "revert" pretentiousness that some muslims try to express.    really you can't expect to be accepted by *all* becuase like every other religion there are extremes, that set their "bar" very high.  and others that set it extremely low.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	What is Judaism, and who or what is a Jew? Depending upon whom you talk to, or the selection of books you read, you will come away with very different answers to this most provocative question. Is Judaism simply a religion? Is it a cultural identity or just an ethnic group? Are Jews only a clan of people or are they a nation?    According to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary a Jew is: 1a: a member of the tribe of Judah b: Israelite 2: a member of a nation existing in Palestine from the 6th century B.C. to the 1st century A.D. 3 : a person belonging to a continuation through descent or conversion of the ancient Jewish people 4 : one whose religion is Judaism.    According to rabbinical Judaism, a Jew is one who has a Jewish mother, or one who has formally converted to Judaism. Leviticus 24:10 is often cited to give this belief credibility, although the Torah makes no specific claim for this tradition. Some rabbis say that it has nothing to do with what that individual actually believes. These rabbis tell us that a Jew does not need to be a follower of Jewish laws and customs to be considered Jewish. In fact, a Jew can have no belief in God at all and still be Jewish based on the above rabbinical interpretation.         Other rabbis make it clear that unless the person follows the precepts of the Torah and accepts the Thirteen Principles of Faith which Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, one of the greatest medieval Jewish scholars) so clearly expresses, he cannot be a Jew. Although this person may be a biological Jew, he has no real connection to Judaism.|`|7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	Yes as long as the conversion is done according to strict Jewish laws.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	I will add my own perspective here, which is supported by the major movements:    Conversion by a Reform or Conservative rabbi is recognized as valid by those two movements but not by Orthodox rabbis.    Conversion by an Orthodox rabbi is recognized by all movements.    If you have converted with a Reform or Conservative rabbi, going through an Orthodox conversion is relatively straightforward and involves going to the mikvah (ritual bath) as well as committing to leading a traditional Jewish lifestyle (keeping kosher and the laws of Shabbat are probably the most prominent, but certainly not all).

My personal belief, is that you can do a dedication for yourself, after a year and a day of study, and then Practice for another year and a day, and then decide if you'd like to pursue joining a coven.    Most covens won't take you without at least a basic knowledge of the Craft, anyway.|`|yAvTxh47aa	I disagree with the guy claiming the Wiccan rede means "As long as it doesn't harm anyone or anything, you can do what you want." You can't even breathe without harming microbes.    For a rational discussion of what genuine Wiccans know the rede means, click here:  http://www.sacred-texts.com/bos/bos661.h...    To consider yourself Wiccan, sincere devotion to the gods, adherance to the principles and ideally, membership in a tradition, are a very good start.    Don't disregard joining a tradition if you've never tried it, it's a good way to get an understanding of the basics from people who've experienced them (you won't come up with terrible Dr. Seuss understandings of things like the Rede from most trads.)    http://www.witchvox.com/_x.html?c=trads is a good collection of essays about trads and groups. The groups themselves submit them, so if it sounds too good to be true, it may well be, and be careful of groups that make outrageous claims or charge money.  Even if you chose to follow no trad, understanding what the others teach will be worth your while.

b3e51d8017977e3cfc2f4c97c2909950aa	The first systematic grammars originate in Iron Age India, with Panini (5th c. BC) and his commentators Pingala (3rd c. BC), Katyayana and Patanjali (2nd c. BC). In the West, grammar emerges as a discipline in Hellenism from the 3rd c. BC with authors like Rhyanus and Aristarchus of Samothrace, the oldest extant work being the Art of Grammar (? ?) attributed to Dionysius Thrax (ca. 100 BC). Latin grammar develops following Greek models from the 1st century BC with authors such as Orbilius Pupillus, Remmius Palaemon, Marcus Valerius Probus, Verrius Flaccus, Aemilius Asper.    Tamil grammatical tradition also begins in ca. the 1st century BC with the Tolkppiyam.    Arabic grammar emerges from the 8th century with the work of Ibn Abi Ishaq and his students.    Belonging to the trivium of the seven liberal arts, grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the Middle Ages, following authors of Late Antiquity like Priscian. Treatment of vernaculars begins gradually from the High Middle Ages, with isolated works such as the First Grammatical Treatise, but becomes influential only from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 1486, Antonio de Nebrija published Las introduciones latinas contrapuesto el romance al latin, and in 1492 the first Spanish grammar, Gramtica de la lengua castellana . In the 16th century Italian Renaissance, the Questione della lingua was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the Italian language, initiated by Dante's de vulgari eloquentia (Pietro Bembo, Prose della volgar lingua Venice 1525).    Grammars of non-European languages began to be compiled from the 16th century for the purpose of evangelization and Bible translation from the 16th century, such as the 1560 Gramtica o Arte de la Lengua General de los Incas o los Reyes del Per Quechua grammar by Fray Domingo de Santo Toms. In 1643 appeared Ivan Uzhevych's Grammatica sclavonica, in 1762 the Short Introduction to English Grammar of Robert Lowth. The Grammatisch-Kritisches W?rterbuch der hochdeutschen Mundart, a High German grammar in five volumes by Johann Christoph Adelung, appeared from 1774.    From the later 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging subject of modern linguistics. The Serbian grammar by Vuk Stefanovi? Karad?i? appeared in 1814. The Deutsche Grammatik of the Brothers Grimm appeared from 1818. The Comparative Grammar of Franz Bopp, starting point of modern comparative linguistics, in 1833.|`|7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	Here is some information the origin of grammar (from the website below).    The first Europeans to write grammar texts were the Greeks, notably the Alexandrians of the lst century BC. The Romans applied the Greek grammatical system to Latin. The works of the Latin grammarians Donatus (4th century AD) and Priscian (6th century) were widely used to teach grammar in medieval Europe.     The first attempts to study grammar began in about the 4th cent. B.C., in India with Panini's grammar of Sanskrit and in Greece with Plato's dialogue Cratylus. The Greeks, and later the Romans, approached the study of grammar through philosophy. Concerned only with the study of their own language and not with foreign languages, early Greek and Latin grammars were devoted primarily to defining the parts of speech. The biblical commentator Rashi attempted to decipher the rules of ancient Hebrew grammar. It was not until the Middle Ages that grammarians became interested in languages other than their own.

AA10493091	I'm 5'4"!!! And I hated being short. I can't even pee standing in some of the restrooms in town! That's just completely horrible... I wish I'm 5'6"!!!     But I'm a bottom guy so maybe there're tops who're not that tall and prefer shorter guys. Some guys reject me cos of my heights, and that's just sad. Is that all they can think of, only physical? So I try to be successful with my life, be a good person, and try to be as tall as I can be...    Try this:  1. Buy shoes with heels...  I wear basketball shoes, they have heels.  2. Be confident!!  Look at them straight in the eyes, stand up straight. Confidence is sexy and make you feel taller!  3. You're not even 20! The growing rate may be slower, but it hasn't stop. You may still have times to grow, so sleep, eat and exercise!!!  A lot!!   4. Be happy with who you are. I know it's hard living in this world where there's a set of what would be called normal and beautiful but those sets are s**t. So if you're beautiful inside, there's nothing to fear - that's the real deal, that's what really important. No one can resist a short great guy.    :) Best of lucks for you (and me)|`|LycVfwU6aa	I've been 5'4" since well before graduating high school, and men have been coming onto me my whole life!  I don't think height should be the question here.  It's confidence, personality, build, features, charm, and everything else you look for in a man.  5'6", you should be getting plenty of dates.  If you perceive yourself in a negative light, it will reflect outward and others will pick up on that.  Look at yourself in the mirror, you know you look good.  Let yourself be filled with confidence (not cocky confidence) and display the same qualities that you like seeing in others.  Soon, the men you like will seek you out!

He had so many girlfriends, he ended up going on dates just about every night in high school . Just maintain that great personality,  forget about what you perceive as your shortcoming, and your confidence will shine through. My brother never cared that he was short; he became a Marine and married a great lady and has two little boys now.     I think you're just impatient, and you think you're failing--but you're not. It just isn't time yet. I am not sure if it is the same between guys as between a man and woman, but I suspect that it is, with some minor variations. Your own ego is the problem, not your height. Focus on being the best you can be and keep caring. Eventually someone will understand and want to be with you more, perhaps for all time! 20 is still young; most people who rush things come to sorrow in one way or another.
32e048e4d3d2bd3138c90848247acc0faa	We had a good turnout at our town's service this morning, as usual in our small town.    Some of our young men have returned from Iraq and were asked to speak.   From what they said and from the fact that they have re-enlisted AFTER seeing the situation in the   Middle -East leads me to believe that it is our politicians attitudes that need readjusting.

La otra persona se unio a la "x" persona y los dos estaran unidos a ti, ligados de una forma espiritual.

Add up all the deaths contributed by Mao Zedong, Josef Stalin Vladimir Lenin, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Mihn, the Khmr Rouge, KGB and you'll get a number the Nazis could only dream of.    Moving on to socialism... well lets get real here. Socialism is communism-lite. The USSR was communist but it standed for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Same thing really.    Capitalism... takes advantage of certain peoples at times but it surely has the smallest number of dead in its shadow. Also you have more freedom in capitalism, like opening a private business for example.

3ghYlNHKaa	How fun!  You'll probably want to start with words that sound like English words so its easy to retain, and words that are practical so she can use and practice them every day. Here's some vocab.:  la chat (sh-at)- the cat  la chien (sh-yun)- the dog  du pan (p-ahn)- some bread  la burre (burrrr)- the butter  la fleur (fl-ur)- the flower  le crayon- the pencil or other writing utensil  l'oeuf (la oaf)- the egg  l'arbre (are-bur)- the tree  le pomme (pom)- the apple  le pomme de terre (pom d- tear)- potatoe  le jus (jus)- juice   jus de orange or jus de pomme (orange juice or apple juice)  le soda- soda  le souris (sore-ee-z)- mouse  la voiture (voy-ture)- car  le metro- bus  le mode (lay mon-d)- the world  le soiel (lay soy-el)- the sun  la rue (la roo)- the street  le livre (la leev-rah)-  book  le garcon (gaar-sss-on)- the boy  la fille (la feel)- the girl  homme (h-ooome)- man  femme (f-emm)- woman  enfant (un-fahnt)- the baby  rouge (rah-oooge)- red  orange (or-ahn-jah)- orange  brun (b-r-oou-n) brown  noir (na-w-our)- black  blanche (ba-laa-n-sh)- white  rose- pink  bleu (bl-ooo)- blue  maroon (mar-oown)- purple  vert (var-T)- green  jaune (jah-on)-yellow    You can leave off the le and la because it gets hard remembering which is male or female (like a book is always male).     She can say "I want" to any of the above by saying:   Je veux (jay-voo)______.   Ex., Je veux le crayon  *note le, la means "the" une, une mean "a" depending on male or female.    salut (sah-looo)- bless you  merci- thank you  bonjour/ allo- hello  au revoir (o rev-war)- good bye  je t'aime (juh tay em)- I love you  Je suis (juh swee) I am _____  or Je m'appelle (juh mapell)- My name is    She can also describe how she's feeling:  Je suis:  -triste (tree-st)- sad  -mal (mall)-bad/sick  -heureuse (her-o-se)- happy  -bien- good  -jealouse (gell-ose)- jealous    That sounds like a lot of fun, I wish my mom did that to me :) Have fun and bonne chance!|`|AA11042645	je mapel amle du formage (sp?) my name is omlette with cheese thank you sponge bob    www.freetranslations.com  this site got me through language class in highschool!|`|v3LoGetuaa	Nicole, the perfect way is to subscribe to French Word-a-Day.

In the US, the term Asian is really imprecise, because, not only are there so many different cultures, many of the "Asians"  have never been outside of the United States and many speak only English.    That girl is right, some of the Asians in the US speak multiple languages (especially if their parents speak little or no English) and a few (hopefully very few) were born in the US but speak fortune cookie English.  But to answer your question, there is no such thing as one giant Asian bloc that has only one opinion.  Opinions will be as numerous as there are individuals.|`|aca2xJQXaa	it's quite narrow since their eyes are so slitty.  i think some asians are actually legally blind

XF5lJWyJaa	loretta, i want to share to you that. i have been into sickness that i ask God the same thing, I even ask Him why He still wants me alive when i'm suffering from the near death sickness i have. I have brochonomonia (more dreadful than asthma) before.  My mom used to confine me to hospital because of my weak lungs, & night after night i've been catching my breath 1 at a time. I don't know what's He up to me, I'm asking Him why is that happening to me.    I understand in my later years of life that God (our Father) only wants the best for us. How? you might ask.  God unconditionally gives his love to us, nothing to trade with, however blessings & curses are conditional.   It is said in the bible that blessings depend on us, He wants us to obey Him.  like our earthly father, if we happen to disobey our parents orders, we sometimes get hurt, but if we do obey them, we get the reward from being obedient.  the same thing with our Father on Heaven, how much more it would be if we obey our Father who is abundantly & exceedingly generous.  sister, you are undergoing a trial right now, the Lord is testing you, how far will you hold on to Him. and He won't give you trials above your neck that you're going to drown on it.   the Lord is looking at your heart. He is knocking at its door. open it again, allow Him to enter your life once and for all.   search for that first love in Jesus.  God bless you & by His stripes believe when you read this that you are already healed, in Jesus name.|`|6C3yW9Gfaa	Ye Gods!! who in hell  told you God is punishing you?|`|ow4M8XZWaa	cz as far as i've learnt, he only loves to do 2 things :    1 : make people suffer  2 : then roast them in hell|`|ojbma922aa	I can tell you, He may be trying to tell you something that you otherwise may not be at liberty to hear Him out about    Besides that, God doesn't want you to be sick, half the time if you're sick, very sick, at that, God didn't do it, He wants you to be healthy and full of life.

Secondo gli alchimisti, l'etere sarebbe il composto principale della pietra filosofale.    per Dante e gli uomini del Trecento, l'Etere era l'aria al di fuori dell'atmosfera terrestre... quindi un elemento angelico e paradisiaco.    non credere a chi ti dice che il quinto elemento sia l'Energia... sono cagate stile Witch della disney.  ciau|`|8a59899d6f35eee9c628edeaf99e1789aa	esistono -4 elementi materiali :terra aria,acqua,fuoco  -4 elementi spirituali:sentimento,coscienza (individuale e suprema),anima,cambiamento  e poi esiste il -quinto elemento,che fa da collante agli elementi materiali e spirituali,la base di tutti gli elementi cio l' energia(chiamata anche etere,ki,forza vitale,e in molti altri modi,che non sto ad elencare)  ps:c' molto contrasto nel parlare degli elementi spirituali,in quanto,molti preferiscono parlare di spirito,al posto di anima,e di ragione al posto della coscienza,ma la ragione e pi materiale,mentre la coscienza  intesa come qualcosa di pi supremo,o evoluzione al posto di cambiamento(altre volte si parla di ciclicit degli eventi),ma infondo si parla delle stesse cose,cio di elementi spirituali|`|hahE2j9aaa	il quinto elemento  l'akasha, cio lo Spirito...|`|KdqlXq6vaa	tutti con sta storia dei 10 punti,mai uno che me li sganci|`|1c59c463fc32eab015c352e5bcc5687daa	Teoricamente dovrebbe essere il "collante" che tiene insieme fuoco, acqua, aria e terra.|`|VnEiJMfsaa	il legno! per i cinesi  il 5 elemento o no?  forse il metallo (che sta al posto dell'aria)...    http://www.oroscopi.com/elementicinesi.h...|`|BUS7vBaKaa	difficile a dirsi: in occidente, il 5 elemento  l'etere, o l'energia interiore o divina; in oriente,  il legno, o il metallo...|`|Z27xtijiaa	ihihihihi....megli che tu nn lo sappia...asd|`|1e254e46fcfe4699da7b022f990beb4aaa	guarda..gli elementi della natura son 4..frse mi sa ke vorr dire ke nn c'entri molto :)|`|U4hXqeJFaa	Lo vuoi proprio sapere non te lo consigli xk sei ........|`|ReDTb1n2aa	Quinto elemento??Che io sappia gli elementi sono 4:Aria, Fuoco, Terra e Acqua.Il mio elemento  l'acqua.Boh forse sar una elemento che li rispecchia tutti o che li unisce, non ti saprei dire nulla di preciso mi spiace.Kiss kiss
7184d6dad6ce8143ba94a31883932d3faa	Pass compos is for isolated events.  Imparfait is for actions which were ongoing in the past.  Though you shouldn't translate, a good way to think of the imparfait is "was xxxing or were xxxing" (as you mentioned).  Imparfait is for description (it was cloudy/rainy, he was happy, etc.).  I'd say those are the "main" differences.    Here are a few other differences:    pass compos:  Used when the onset of the action is clearly seen, although the specific beginning point may not necessarily be stated (Je suis all au cinma.), The end point of the action is clearly seen, though the specific time may not necessarily be stated (J'ai quitt le cinma  la fin du film.), Duration is clearly stated.  An action is repeated a specific number of times.    Imparfait:  Recurring activities, background and circumstances, conditions (I had a headache,), feelings.    If you have more questions, please write me and I'll help you.|`|W3rXCrr9aa	I'm not sure if you mean in how they are formed or in what they mean? Part of the trouble if you are trying to look it up is you are not spelling it right. it is imparfait  and pass compos    The imparfait is always one word and has a particular set of endings. The pass compos is made up of the past participle of the main verb preceded by a conjugation of either avoir (to have) or tre (to be).    The imparfait as you heard is usually used for some action or condition / state  that was ongoing at some time in the past, and may have continued for some time.   It may be translated by 'was doing'  or "used to do" or "in the past we would do...."  But may also just be translated by a regular past tense like "was" but meaning an ongoing thing.     here is an example with 2 uses of the Imparfait  "Quand j'tais petite, je croyais que le chat tait la femelle du chien!"  When I was little, I used to believe that the cat was the female of the dog!|`|grXfSwtNaa	I'd say one difference is the endings for verbs.  I'm not the best at both of them, but I do know they have different endings, and like you said, imparfait's ongoing.|`|ZPPDxULlaa	Imparfait>>>>>>>imperfect  Pass compos>>>>>>>>>simple past ,emphatic past     nice link for you  http://french.about.com/library/weekly/a...    bonne chance

htLnzcp6aa	Someday, 5000 years from now, the next civilization will be digging up artifacts from the years 2010-2040 and will discover a theory that the cell phone led to the demise of the human race.    I mean seriously... some people cannot function without that thing attached to their ear.  Maybe we should start taxing cell phone minutes heavily and people will realize just how unimportant almost all of those conversations are.      Also, they have clearly complicated our lives.  We are all in such a hurry due to the need for instant gratification that we have lost the ability to stop and just enjoy life.    Cellphones are great for emergencies.   I have one, and I use it occasionally, but not often.  I prefer to pick up the regular old phone from home or to actually go see someone and talk to them face to face.|`|5a9bed98312d45ccb04e4b3f80fef75eaa	Way easier........At the mall, or on vacation and you split up. Shopping and you need to know if we have milk at home. In a accident and need help.  Lots of scenarios where they are a save.  As for people bugging you, same as with a land line....don't answer it.  Love Them!!!!|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	I think they're great for emergencies. I dont get the point of these 10 year olds walking around with them just to talk to their friends, but I've had a few occassions where I would've been in some deep trouble without my cell phone. (like my car breaking down in the middle of a highway, at 1 am, and getting completely lost one day in my car....It turns out I wasn't even in the same state anymore). I think its funny when people say they dont have any use for them. My sister says that they're stupid and she never wants one because she'd never use it.. She's always in situations where a cell phone would've made her life much easier but she didnt have one.|`|GTkGsIu2aa	i dont have a cell phone...i mean theres no point....i dont feel like paying 60 buckks a month for there service and baerly use it....i dont have anybody to call???i work and go to school.....friends??? no.....gf???i dont have one anymore....so i dont care|`|55a93da228f9cd8b0e2d860b39395c92aa	A necessary evil.|`|79Fcbmtvaa	I think they are a revolutionary idea.

I've moved about an hour and a half away from my vet that we always had growing up. Both for our cats and dogs and horses and cows.  I do the drive and sit for hours for the 'first come first serve' old fashioned service.  I see people I graduated with and hear stories that I couldn't get in a book. I drive past my high school and rehash what happened 25+ years ago with my mom and children.  Mom still lives in the home I grew up in and we visit very very often (I make the 40 minute drive a couple times a week) we still laugh and giggle at stuff from years past.     It's fun and I'm blessed to be able to re-visit often!!!!|`|jJRi67pXaa	Every once and a bit.|`|vfxDznrQaa	i do.  and i always have.  i really don't know if that says anything about me or not.  but i moved around some when i was a child, so i've been back to each place several times over the years.

I am a very sentimental person...that i'm sure has ALOT to do with it....I like to see how time changes things, and to just see and remember good times.

AA11749193	Hey there "Elderly Folks Are Cool"- What an awesome question!! :-D  You are right on target- Do NOT give anything to Administration! First of all, go out and visit. Talk to the Activities Director, Social Worker, or Nursing Staff re: Ideas. They will know more than anybody what needs the Residents of a Facility would want/need. Volunteering your time would be a wonderful thing to do. Getting to know the Residents, and seeing who doesn't get much company always is a gr8 idea. Finding groups or organizations that could come out and entertain is always a way for the Community to visit the Nusing Home "Community". They are not able to go out, as they once did. With the Holidays soon upon us, this would be a good time to talk with Schools, Churches, and other Groups to come out and sing, visit, etc.     Many Nursing Homes do not allow certain products, like powder, as it is a fall risk item. However, they sure allow lap robes, candy, cookies, fruit, greeting cards, and Bingo prizes. Yes, it is SO true- The Residents LOVE Bingo! If you are able to sew, or know others who do, Wheelchair Bags are always needed- These carry the Resident's wheelchair pedals and are always needed. Quilted items, things to hang on their doors- Gosh, they enjoy darned near anything and everything. Just knowing you care is a gift in itself.    Hope this helped with your question a bit. Thanks for being such a wonderful person who truly cares for the eldery- Yes, They certainly are cool folks, indeed! :-D|`|UOO2pnJDaa	Well they need the security codes to override the rear doors to the nursing home and a nice get away car with a full tank of gas.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Most of the residents in nursing homes like a variety of things. I worked at a local nursing home & I got a good idea as to what residents like to do to keep themselves busy throughout the days & evenings. Here are some suggestions:    (1) Deck of cards  (2) Puzzles (small ones so they have room to do them & not have to worry about  a lot of puzzle pieces)  (3) Magazines of all kinds (No Playboy or Playgirl....LOL)  (4) Yahtzee  (5) Checkers  (6) Teddy Bears.....Yes, the residents love to hold them  and/or sleep with them  (7) Crossword puzzle books  (8) Paper tablets & pencils/pens  (9) Stationary   (10) Chess     The greatest gift you can give them, is your time. Spend an afternoon with them, to get to know them. So many of the residents in all nursing homes, are depressed & ready to give up because they never have company. Stimulating conversation will perk them right up. Ask them about their youth. They love to talk about their younger days. Take the local newspaper with you & read it to a resident who isn't able to read it on their own. Thank you for caring!|`|AA12038658	How about games they used to like to play? (Parchesi, backgammon, etc) Also old-fashioned candies such as root beer barrels & horehound. CD's of Big Bands.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	    We made and brought them small lap quilts, blankets, things like this. These places, as nice as some are, are drafty.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Body Wash, body lotion, powder.  Maybe a nice afghan for their beds, or a nice sweater.  If they can still read, books  and magazines are always good.  If they like crossword puzzles, that is something good to give them too.  If they are not on restricted diets, take them some of their favorite cookies or candy.  If they are allowed to have "things" in their room, a nice potted flower that they can put on the windowsill to brighten up their room, or a nice plant.  Sun-catchers to put in the window are a nice thing to bring them too. If they are women, pretty nightgowns or a nice robe.  Men like pj's or a nice sweater.  One thing not to do is give them money.  I know from experience that it will disappear.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	There isn't one thing that is going to appeal to everyone.  When I was little, mom used to take us kids with her when she went to visit people in the nursing homes.  One lady was from mom's church and she just wanted someone to visit with, chat with.  Mom would sometimes bring the lady home to have lunch with us too.  The lady had everything she needed (had really nice rooms that I'd love to live in), just needed friends and loved to see us little kids being kids.  We also would visit this asian man who just wanted McDonald's regular hamburger and fries or real Japanese food since the home never provided any and he missed having "comfort" food.  Large print books or books on tape/cd would probably be appreciated if you know what their taste in reading material is.  I always take the books, jigsaw puzzles and board games no one plays with anymore to the local nursing homes.  If your people have DVD player, maybe travel DVDs.|`|d94c1a3edaa8cb35469b62403f60ed9caa	slippers, bedsocks, a soft cushion for a wheelchair, a lap robe but most of all, your time.|`|f3IdjgiEaa	Your time would mean more than anything.  How about taking them out for walks or quick jaunts to the store.  Or maybe just ask them?|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	Personal care items, like fragrant lotion, hand cream, slippers, night wear, robes, sweaters, clothing  or a silk flower arrangement to brighten their room.    Touch lamps for the night stand.    Decorated miniature Christmas tree with 15 light set and miniature ornaments.  For Christmas we took it to her room and after Christmas we took it home, covered it and it was ready for the next Christmas.    A seasonal wreath for her door.    Also sun glasses with a chain, when we took her for a walk.  Some patients wanted sun glasses so bad, that we had to replace hers quite often.  Bright lights hurt her eyes in the dining room.  She wore them when she ate her meals.    We supplied all these items for my husbands mother because the nursing home did not.    She lived there the last 5 years of her life.  She passed away when she was 96.     Now we use the same Christmas tree for our tree at home every year and have a beautiful memory of her, knowing it was her tree for 5 years.    These are some of the things that are not included in their care.    Very good question.  DeeJay.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	Everyone has given great answers and it's difficult to think of much to add.  When I worked in the business office of a nursing home I adopted a resident every year.  I would send them body lotion or pay for a few visits to the beauty shop.  During the holidays I payed for the ladies to get a perm in the beauty shop and bought them a nice outfit.  If it was a man I payed for them to get a hair cut several times a year.  I would do the same thing as I did for the ladies by sending them cologne.  I worked with the Activities Director for direction on what their needs were.  I picked individuals who were on Medicaid and had no money for such luxuries.  I only asked the Director not to let the person know where these little gifts were coming from.  |`|AA10407322	I suggest to read to them or even record books to tape.|`|kjvGggH6aa	Everyone had some very good answers! Perhaps another item to keep them warm would be a knitted muffler to wrap around their neck. Store bought ones can be a little pricey but if you go to a second hand store you might be able to purchase them for less money.|`|uSSuwA5waa	A bingo board could work as older people love to play bingo. A cane, a board game like monopoly, or a good book.    You can also try getting them a nice sweater or newspaper subscription of a few months (old people like to read newspapers, it's old-fashioned).    Any gift that requires the four of them to do an activity together would make them so happy I bet (if these 4 old elderly people hang out with each other on a constant basis) since they can spend their fun time with each other in a meaningful and fulfilling way.    Hope this helps, and the other users' suggestions work great too.    Probably would help to tell us how much money you're willing to spend on these fine elderly folks to. |`|hrCCTlGbaa	Go visit them, talk to them, that's often gift enough in itself, plus you can find out directly from them what they want or need.|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	LARGE   PRINT  books,  a  library could help order  them.

VpOGcG4maa	Very important for my children and grandchildren.    Education is very important to my family.     When my boys were young on Saturday's they went to Chinese School and in Jr High all took Spanish. They all know some sign Language.    You need a second language to attend an University. Two years in a foreign language that incl. sign language.  All my children except the youngest (she is 11) attended a Preparatory High School. She knows a lot of sign.  From Preparatory the boys could go straight too a 4 year University      As for three of my younger grandchildren attend preschool that teaches Spanish.

I also don't feel that the USA should have to print everything in at least 4 languages either. Further, I think the USA needs to establish a national language.English is the language of business and is still spoken by the vast majority of US citizens.

QcIkZdBFaa	  Sad and shameful.  Our treatment of the  aged - it definitely reflects on us as a culture|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	 you are right.  It doesn't matter who you are, what you are, or what walk of life you come from, nor your background.  It is very sad to get old and have to go to a nursing facility.  People sit in those places day after day, hoping for a friendly smile, a pat on the shoulder, a hug, anything at all.  They are hungary for company, and it is a disgrace that no one goes to see them.  I know people in health facilities that have families, and they are lucky to see them once or twice a year.  People better wake up - because if we live long enough, most of us, unless we are extremely fortunate to have enough money to have home care - will end up in nursing homes.  Then the shoe will be on the other foot and they will the ones looking for the loving faces and voices of their friends and families.|`|a4LWildhaa	Unfortunately that is the way it is at least here in the USA.|`|acaJSqW6aa	I don't think it was an article pointing out the difference between gays and straights.

As Ginger said I don't think the homosexual elderly would be left alone that much because they do seem to have large extended 'families' of friends more than heterosexuals.  Probably past partners.    Most of the elderly that I have cared for have been visited regularly by their families - some relative dropping in at least once a week.    There is one that has stood out though - his 3 children visited him, one of them an Occupational Therapist.  But they still seemed oblivious to his needs:  I arranged for him to have a suitable stool to put his swollen legs up,  pushed buttons and got him in to hospital when his condition grew worse at times and encouraged him to do gentle exercises suitable to his condition.    He himself cut off contact with his siblings and some cousins and friends because of his aggressive nature.  He told me that himself.  And he regretted it.    The homosexuals are the ones who have isolated themselves from close family members because like Pooky said it is an agenda to them and not a concern :    Why do they let anyone know that they have perverse sex with someone the same gender as themselves.  Sex is a private matter between two loving people;   not you and the rest of the world.  If they were not so exhibitionist about their  unusual sexual behaviours family members would not be put off.|`|AA12038658	I hear what you're saying. I have an aunt in a nursing home in another state. Her daughter visits several times a week; her son once in a great while. I write & send her things.    The only difference I've seen is that they are not legally recognized as a couple. If they entered your nursing home, could they share a room as married couples do? If one were to die, would the other automatically inherit from the estate, or would the family step in to fight it? We had a situation like that here in S FL. One man died. They had been living together for 30 years. The family locked up the house including all of the possessions inside, a lot of which belonged to the other man, & the court upheld the family's position because they weren't legally married. They couldn't be here.|`|AA11438887	Oh, agreed. It seems the elderly have problems getting included in a lot of things.

You are absolutely right about the lack of visits from friends and family. No matter what race, creed, religion or sexual orientation. People just do not like to come there . It is very, very sad.   I had two ladies in the nursing home last week who gave me a hug and said do you love me? nobody else does. I got choked up. |`|59Wg2cI3aa	The eskimoes are more humane -- they set the elderly adrift on an ice floe    The American indian took all their possessions and left them behind to fend for themselves when the tribe moved on - again, more humane      Perhaps it's time to take a few pages from Soylent Green.|`|AA11017231	It's a shame that the elderly in your sphere have been neglected like that. In my family it's not that way. Only one that I can remember, an aunt, was ever placed in a nursing home and that was of her own choosing as to not be a burden on her family. Still, her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren visited her regularly and extended family at times as they were able. From your experience gay and lesbian seniors may be no more neglected but you can't argue with the fact that prior to being put into that position, because of the reasons stated in the article, they did have less of a support system and were more isolated than heterosexuals. That could be the very reason they ended up in a nursing home. Just because you are upset about the lack of caring by family for their elderly family members, does not change the facts of the article, even if the only difference in nursing homes is, for heterosexuals their isolation is not of their own choosing and for gay and lesbians it is.|`|3tDUG0Eqaa	I personally think this article ignored one fact:  Many "elderly" homosexuals had families back when they were forced by society into denial.  I don't see their situation as "worse" than that of heteros.  |`|34e4ec9fb8a88ea1920c68439597df01aa	Years ago when I was taking my 87 year old bed-fast grandmother into our home, our family doctor said it better than I ever could.    "Isn't it sad that one mother can raise 8 children, but 8 children cannot take care of one mother?"    Your experience is not a statistical anomaly, unfortunately.  It's the status quo for a society that puts self satisfaction and gratification above all else.      Based upon my experience with friends in the gay community, I would say that there will be national attention to the problem, and a network of individual groups will organize to raise awareness of the problem, develop a plan to address it, and implement that plan.  And the end result will be that gay seniors will have a superior support system.  |`|6vGsBaWZaa	As someone who also worked a while in nursing homes, I agree 100% with your statement that very few elderly residents are visited by family, and I think that is both a sad and disgusting fact. The elderly, from my experience, are one of our greatest resources, regardless of their sexual preference, profession, or anything else. In the facilities where I worked there were a few who had regular (or relatively regular) visits from family and friends--but they were VERY few! The vast majority of residents received no more than an obligatory visit around Christmas, and those visits rarely lasted more than an hour. The saddest thing to me was that the residents had been healthy and thriving up until the ONE visit from their families, and I'm completely convince that, had the families who didn't visit regularly just stayed away, those elderly residents would have continued to live relatively happy lives. The unfortunate truth of the matter is that, after the families "once" annual visits, those residents invariably took a turn for the worst, and usually died within a week or two. Those of us who saw the residents every day truly wished those families had just stayed away, since we worked extremely hard trying to give the residents a healthy and happy life at the nursing homes.    I don't think the person asking the question was saying anything against the AARP, nor was there anger at the GLBT community; rather, the anger I saw was directed at the fact that so many of our elderly are neglected or forgotten by family, friends, and society at large.    I applaude SAGE for their efforts to join the elderly of the GLBT community with younger people who can help them with daily tasks, transportation to doctors appointments and to provide companionship and friendship in the elders' sunset years. But I don't think being lonely as you age is something confined to the GLBT community.|`|VxYEsUYvaa	I think that it is rare to find someone who is truly a friend.  As my mother's Alzheimer's deepened, the only people who came by for a visit (from the east coast no less), was a middle aged gay couple who had been their next door neighbors.    All their other friends either couldn't come visit because of the distance or I think, they were uncomfortable being around someone afflicted such as my mother.  Others are reminded of their own lives and what they could face.    It is sad, but very true.  But I wonder how much of this we created on our own?|`|SLMD50eOaa	old people are gay???? I am shocked..traumatized for the next 20 years thank you very much..

Listen to her when she speaks with your eyes, ears and your heart.   Bless you|`|31fd278ee422095a5f1153f3ba3dfbeaaa	Do what you can to be sure she is comfortable and healthy. Talk to her, love her, and if she is in anyway showing signs of dementia, you have to remember that it is not under her control. Enter her reality, because she cannot enter yours if she has dementia. Be there for her when she needs you. And take good care of yourself too.|`|QWm38NiKaa	just show her that u love her as mother , as son|`|7Vka1VcOaa	For starters, stop thinking of her as my old mum.|`|5f930dd66cfee7f04720c41de82939d8aa	Mothers never change.  They always love you and want to know what you are doing and what's going on in your life.  The best thing you can do for her besides making sure she has what she needs is to spend time with her.  I like that idea of having coffee or tea every morning and set up a special time to take her where she would like to go.  Ask her about her story.  What she did when she was young.  If you are smart, you will record it.  My old aunt and I went back to where she and my mom spent their youth.  She showed me where my mother was married, where the lady lived that my mom was named after, we went to the cemetery and found my great, great, great grandmother's grave & many more.  I took lots of pictures and wrote it all down.  How precious.  I so wish I had written down my father's stories.  He was a pro ball player and had tales of playing ball in Cuba and the place they were staying get shot up and dropping water balloons down of the managers head.  So many stories lost.  Get her story down to pass on.  Find out who she was and what she did.  Everyone has a marvelous story to tell and most memories are wonderful.|`|H30gst1Caa	Well, this is a hard one. Just tell her you love her and say that you have changed and all. Also , tell her to give u a chance to show her that.     All the best my friend.|`|49d01cf5ca354a9bb5bb56ca3c9c4103aa	Take care of your mom, tell her how much you love her(if you do) and tell her god will always be with her. =)|`|zgF7TIxbaa	you must be a joker man|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Listen to her when she wants to talk to you, and I mean really listen.  Prepare favorite foods for her, spend as much time with her as you can.  I took care of my parents for 5 years before they died, every single day, and the thing that they wanted most from me was understanding, love, and letting them know that I really cared.  I would do it all again if I had the chance - those 5 years were very meaningful, and meant a lot to them and to me.  And one thing you should NEVER do is talk down to her or treat her like a little child.  She may be elderly, but she is an adult so treat her like one.  I wish you many wonderful years with your mother.  You will never regret one single minute of what you are doing.  I know, because I experienced it with my mother and father.  It was wonderful.|`|O9FojdEMaa	and never quarrel with her even when you know she's wrong, it only aggravates things.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I would try to discuss the front page of the newspaper and drink a cup of coffee with her and or tea and try to maybe have her favorite lunch with her too. To share a meal or to share a cup of coffee or tea is a good way to start. Find out her favorite hobbies. Good Luck!|`|92a3fb7b7f1d654236cf6fd9992204d4aa	Visit her. Share what is going on with your life and then listen to her talk. She may repeat stories that you have already heard but eventually we all do that.  Let her talk about her memories and be interested. Ask questions during her stories.   Take her out to eat if she wants. Tell her you love her and appreciate all she has done for you.|`|80lWqRFiaa	Take the time to really listen to how she feels and what she wants and needs. Make sure she eats right and gets the proper care from a doctor. And just being there with her is the most important thing. good for you.|`|14e3f62e4aadac6dc3e97d2ea1b5e895aa	Take her out every week-end to a nice restaurant.  Don't rush her!  Sit and listen to what she has to say and enjoy your meal.    After eating, ask her if she wants to go for a ride anywhere?  Is there anything she needs that you can pick up for her while you're out.    Ask her if she's having any trouble keeping up with her heating bill? or her TV cable bill? (probably her only entertainment.) Ask her what kind of snack you can buy her that she really loves.      If she lives at home, make a safety inspection and see if all electrical cords are safe, if the front door locks easily, can she use the cook stove safely? Get rid of all throw rugs that can slide--also all bedspreads that hang down over the corner of the bed.    If she has arthritis bad, there are many aids now that help her to write, eat, wash, open a door, etc.   Thanks you for loving your mum.  I don't have that.|`|I7czCjvsaa	Just let her know you're there and love her! That is what all mothers want!That is all she needs!Good luck!
VpOGcG4maa	Thank you for sharing that was to funny it gave me a good laugh also.  Yes, I relate by the time I put my cell phone in my purse, keys, glasses wallet, check book, check the gas in my car.   Fill my coffee cup   I forget what I did with my purse.   When I get the idea to call my Phone with the house phone I realize I have lost my house phone.  When I get exhausted looking for my purse   I just get another purse fill that with my extra glasses, another wallet, spare keys another check book.   Then I go out to my car there is my other purse(: LQTM.:)...  Then I look at my wrist run inside for my watch coffee is cold warm it up again ...  Then I sit down because now I forgot were I was going and I most likely late anyway.   True story...|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I can certainly relate to this song. I loved it.

I'll be passing it along to some friends and family members if I can remember their email addresses.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	I've often gotten distracted and can't find things or forgotten thing because I"ve had too many other things on my mind so age hasn't been totally the culprit for me.  I did, a few years ago, go through a period when I was always walking out of the house with out my keys and having to run around to my friends'-with-keys places almost daily just to get back into my place.  I finally got REALLY angry with myself and told myself this would not be tolerated, I was better then this (and I didn't want to bother my friends in the middle of the night anymore) so I started playing memory games on the computer.  Yes, it does help and I haven't locked myself out anymore (knock wood).  I still put things away "somewhere I'll be able to easily find it when I need it" and then can't find it when I need it, but I've always done this.  And I do things like start to take a dirty shirt to the hamper, notice the water by the bed needs refilling so I grab it, see that the cat has vomited in the hallway so put everything down to clean it up, grab the water bottle and fill it up and return it to the bedside and completely forget about my shirt which sits there until one day I'm tearing apart the closet trying to find it and, if I"m lucky, find it sitting in the hallway where I last left it still needing washing.  It's more a problem with having too many little things that have to be done.|`|80lWqRFiaa	I had a good laugh and tears are on my face. I have had those moments, just the other day I was talking to my baby sister on my cell phone and getting my purse and keys ready to go out, when I said oh darn I cannot find my cell phone. DUH she said , you are talking on it. |`|b3h0ovgRaa	I loved it! It sounds so much like hubby who can never find his car keys because he can't find his glasses to look for them. Thank  you for sharing. I once put milk in the cabinet and thought I must have forgotten to buy it when I did not see it in the fridge the next morning. I was greatly surprised to see it when I opened the cabinet for the can of coffee. Thank goodness I  don't do that often. It gave me such a jolt.  Poppy|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Loved it!  And yes, I have had senior moments myself!  I wanted to call my friend just to chat, so I took my cell phone outside to sit in the garden while I talked to her.  I only thought that I had my cell phone - when I went to use it, guess what - it was the remote to the tv.  So I had a good laugh on myself, and when I told my friend, she got a chuckle out of that too.  Senior moments - make the best of them!|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	I have a habit of taking off my glasses to read sometimes. I have days when I can read better without them.

Losing Ones Memory isn't fun or funny. Laughing helps us get through the day. I had never heard of Tom Rush. I will try to find his recording.  Great site!|`|AA10717870	I rather agree with kayboff ...  I have had some tolerable and funny senior moments - I'm 57 - but lately the frequency has become alarming.  And the most recent consequence of my failing memory is tragic:  I lost my job because I failed to learn this sales 'script' required by my company.  I worked with my boss, calling on customers last week, and he totally tore me apart and said my presentations were across the board unacceptable.  I am trying to put this in perspective - one customer I made a presentation to said 'What a great salesperson you are!'  And looked at my boss and said 'She must be one of your very best reps!'  He just said nothing ...  The customer didn't realize, of course, that he had just told me how very crummy my previous presentations were...   So - I'm trying to hold on to that other opinion and try to have hope that my career life isn't just over.  I noticed that my memory really began to fail after I lost my beloved husband about a year ago.  A friend said it could be that I'm depressed, that memory loss has been related to that.  I have been horribly sad without my husband and can't seem to get over the loss, but I don't feel overall 'depression' - though I may not be clear on what that is.    Anyway, I've researched what to do to strengthen memory and the advice to use your brain is best.  Also, I learned that vitamin B12 and Cortisol help ...  and I take those daily ...  And by the way, I'm a tournament level Scrabble player!  Surely there is hope for me ...  Scrabble requires a brain and remembering those obscure 'X',, 'J' .. and 'Q' words ...   right?   LOL ...  loved the Tom Rush song... thanks...|`|LlCnUAnFaa	How many times have I looked for my glasses and find that they are on my nose.

It was like Deja Vu all over again, he could be singing my life's story!

I ordered custom-made seat covers that cost almost $200 for my car. When they arrived I put them away to install later.  I have been looking for them for over a year!|`|sZFLtCbdaa	I wish there was a spot for best questions. You earned kid.  that was a good one.  What was he singing about? I forgot.
6743241b5aaa7f9777de7e002799bf2daa	I used to be afraid of everything--monsters, fire, storms---as a child.  Then, as I grew older I was afraid of not succeeding, not being accepted.  That gradually grew into fear of death or health issues, then the death of my spouse and children.  Then, one day something clicked in me.  I always believed in God, but I really had no clue about what this life is all about.  I looked to God and realized that there is nothing to fear.  So what if a storm or fire destroys my home.  I'll make it.  So what if I don't make more than 5 figures or have all the friends in the world.  I have enough money to put food on my table and a roof over my head.  I have one friend that will NEVER let me down.  He's always there.  God will support me in anything.  Last, but not least---death.  This life is nothing but a spark, a moment in time, a test.  I get through this, I'll go on to a better life.  My only fear now is wondering if I have done enough to convince my children to want to go to Heaven too.  But, I do my best.  We pray, we read the Bible together, we talk about God all the time.  Only my children can make that choice.  I just pray daily that they will make the right choice.  But I can't let the fear get me down.  I fight it, because I know it's the "dark side" LOL messing with me.

1498434f366a56b1b0b7643757ab51b3aa	I've been a Wiccan for a long time and I can honestly tell you that it's a difficult but extremely rewarding religion.  Start your path at the bookstore and study up on Scott Cunningham's books on Wicca and also go to www.witchvox.com and see if there are any Wiccans in your area that you can get together with.  Keep it small and casual and work your way up and keep an open mind.  Also it's a good idea to find something to get involved in to help your community.  A lot of Wiccans like to help causes that help the environment or animals.      Remember; it isn't an easy religion and you may get slack from people around you but if you stick with it you won't be sorry.  The best part about Wicca is its difficulty; otherwise anyone would do it.  |`|38vza5Gxaa	1) Ignore the fundies saying youll go to hell and are opening yourself up to demons. We dont believe in either.  2) Get the book: Wicca, a Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham (Amazon.com used books is a great resource)  3) Avoid Silver Ravenwolf, DJ Conway and most Llewellyn books  4) Do NOT pay for lessons over the internet.  You cant ask for references.  Do NOT give out personal information to anyone over the internet.  Get a PO Box.    5) www.witchvox.com  www.wicca.timerift.net  6) Learn and keep learning about various paths in paganism.  7)  get the book: "Drawing Down the Moon" by Margo Adler (an older book that's a little dated, especially concerning Asatru but a good resource) - it gives an overview on a lot of pagan traditions.  Might help you narrow things down.  |`|EjzXHA70aa	Ignore the doosayers, paganism is a much "Purer" religion than christianity and islam.

If you want books, Scott Cunningham's 'Wicca' is fantastic.    And don't listen to the people who are screaming 'OMFG YOU'RE GOING TO HELL`11'. There's nothing wrong with looking around. And wiccans don't believe in hell anyway.    Also-wicca is not satanism. Satanism is a whole other religious belief.

Read more widely - books, magazines, internet.      Talk with people - on the net, face to face where you live, people who practice many of the varieties of that faith and have done so for years.    Ask  lots of questions, such as- what is the range of beliefs?     What is the range of practices of their faith?   How are communities organized?   How do they perceive themselves?   How do others perceive them?   How has their faith changed their lives?     You are looking at a big decision and making a serious commitment- Wicca or any other faith.     Best wishes on whatever you decide!|`|ErgIkzFKaa	Only once in God's Word is the mention against Witches(Wiccan.) In the Book of Exodus you will find these rules against these two aspects of life. Because The Hebrews was a fledgling race there had to be some constraints put upon them so they would multiply and fill the earth. They had also to be fully aware that the God was true and on their side even though many times after leaving Egypt they tested His resolve. There are many out there who would condemn your decision to follow Wicca. I do not, nor is it my place to. I would only advise you as you follow the path of Wicca, be good to all humanity.

AA11376570	Well silly ....lets see I will stick you in one of our deep freezes with a blanket and lets see how warm you keep ..........Numnut !!!    These people fought for our country so that we can live the way we do ...heating and basic commodities should be free for them ....but we just chuck em in a home to dribble and die without any dignity .. |`|DZzBfzVeaa	well despite what everyone else on here is saying i agree with you! There are many programs that help with people who cant afford heat as well as food and many other things.  Maybe a blanket just wont do it but how bout grabbing two blankets? And Can we please not leave out the rest of the world thats freezing to death too! Not just old people have problems paying for their bills. Younger people are dieing of no heat also! as well as babies and youth, so go get a blanket, how bout a nice heating blanket....those are my fav!|`|AA11366224	Extra blankets and extra cardigans don't prevent hypothermia in the very old and the very young.  You're only here because your parents didn't let you freeze to death, but you're too greedy and self-centred to return the compliment.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	well l was not going to jump in but i will -- most of the old folks i know here in southern illinois and we do have some cold winters seem to make it ok -- mainly because the ones my age were not raised with central heating and were used to haveng maybe only one or two room really heated!!!! unused rooms were shut off and not heated -- also these folks like the squirrels realize that winter cost more and so in the summer than sand bag and have the extra cash!!  also last week i helped winterize homes by putting plastic on outside windows and bales of straw in front of the crawl places under the house!!!!  |`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	A few more extra blankets won't keep them warm. They need the heat turned up & kept up, to  keep the floors, walls, & ceilings heated, in order to keep their bodies warm. If they piled on the blankets as you suggested, then they'd have to spend every day in bed 24/7. That's not living, it's merely existing, especially if they don't have family to help them out. |`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	It is a terrible thing to be cold.  And crawling under a few extra blankets to keep warm is no way for anyone to live.  Just imagine trying to go about your daily chores all bundled up in big bulky blankets, or having to spend most of your time in bed just to keep yourself from freezing to death.  Many of them living on one insufficient social security check.   These folks are nice people, they just don't have enough money to get by on.  Imagine what it would be like if you didn't have enough money each month to cover your expenses, especially in the winter.  They aren't stupid, they just don't have the money, therefore they try to compensate by keeping their thermostat turned down so low they are subject to hypothermia.  It seems to me that this government needs to do more to help people in situations like this.  Let's hope the next president will do just that.  No one should have to be cold or hungry, especially someone that has worked hard all his life and is now trying to get by on a very limited income.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	I think the answer is that in winter you need heat, not only to keep warm, but to keep the damp out of the house. If the air is damp and breathed in it makes any kind of respiratory disease worse. In any case, the sick and elderly feel the cold much more badly than others.  Those with rheumatism arthritis and other diseases suffer unspeakable pain which is accentuated by the cold. Even a bit of cold.  When you're old and ill you are often less mobile and sitting still just lets the cold seep into your bones even though you have a blanket, hat, warm slippers and a good supply of old newspapers.    When we were children my dad had emphysema and he always wore a hat indoors, (about 40% of body heat is lost through the top of the head) and tucked a newspaper down the front of his jumper to protect his chest from the cold (newspaper is an excellent form of insulation). If it got really cold indoors he would put a scarf over his mouth so that the air would be slightly warmed before he actually breathed it into his lungs.     It is VERY offensive to people like me to hear overpaid politicians give crass suggestions for how to keep warm. It proves that they really are talking out of their backsides.  |`|cf2c7a928eb151f3dc7e67af8dc5ee43aa	Go look up the word compassion in the dictionary.|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	When the house is cold and the air is cold even under a blanket or two does it make a difference. I am not that old, 70, but I put on additional warmth now especially in the evenings but there is no substitute for all round warmth. I am now spending 15% of my income on heating and cooking and all other needs such as holidays and family presents have been suspended. Yes you are being very insensitive. I might add that there will be a lot of younger people worse off as unemployment etc moves into another gear.|`|GI27dKIkaa	You're not being insensitive at all !    Pensioners in the UK get 124 plus a week in state pension.  They get their whole rent paid AND they also get a 200 payment in November towards their heating - without having to apply for it.    I'm now on long-term sickness - having worked all my life, since leaving school thirty years ago.    I get 58 a week incapacity benefit, pay 10 of that towards my rent and HALF the rest goes on Gas & electric. What's left goes on food.  That 200 bonus would pay my gas bill for the whole year !|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	Perhaps people don't want to wander round their home draped in blankets.  Lots of old folk do just that,they sit in the front room with a blanket round their shoulders and one bar of an electric fire for heating.    A single pensioner gets around 90 a week here UK,married couples around 145.  That is if they've paid full stamps for the required number of years. That is also money they are entitled to after contributing to the State pension scheme.  The winter allowance is a softener to ease the hardship of not getting a decent pension compared to most other European countries. That will put their average pension up to a full 94|`|iNkOiNC7aa	eldrerly have impaired circulation, they are like children, they dehydrate easily. Plus sometimes they are forced to let badly needed medication go to pay some of utilities. These companies are not made to go by anyone's income and if all you get is a certain amount, then you can't afford any suprises. something has to go unfortunately, it usually ends up being them. Did you know if you are elderly, and well off you dont have the option not to take the social security check, we had that happen to a retired governor here, he said for the state to keep it and they said they couldn't do that. How many well off people try not to take that and are forced to take money they dont need from a government that doesnt have it to give! Could have paid some of those dead peoples heating bills. Oh well, thats profit in america.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	I agree with the asker. I grew up in a draughty, pre-Victorian 18 room Vicarage, without central heating. In fact my parents couldn't afford to keep more than one fire going at a time. In the day time we were all in the large kitchen and about dinner time we lit the fire in the living room. The Bedrooms were unheated. My Grandmother, who lived with us was in her 70s, but we survived. People can't expect to be able to wear blouses or t-shirts all year round. My house is centrally heated, but the heating is on minimum. I have a selection of knitted jackets and if it gets really cold in the evening and I'm alone watching TV, I'll put a light quilt round my shoulders.  The living room temp. now is 69F - 20.5C. |`|gAiBzHS6aa	With the air frigid all around you, the blankets don't do such a efficient job of snuggly warm.  We in the US do have at least 1 federal program for fuel, FUEL ASSISTANCE, they do their figuring on how much you are entitled to and send the check directly to your fuel company.  It is not just for seniors but all low income.  Since it is federal I would think it is available nationwide.  They also, if you own your own home, weatherize it, leave not even a crack for air to enter, its great.  When Christmas in April chooses the homes they re-vamp, if you need weatherization they try to take care of that also.  A wonderful program.    NO matter how many blankets you have if you have no heat, the air around you being cold, those blankets can only do so much.    In this area of Maryland we think its cold but usually does not compare to some other states.  Then in summer, we run around giving fans   away, because of the heat.  |`|sqdsIHwAaa	don't know where you are getting your facts from in the UK we get a grant to insulate our houses a payment each year towards heating|`|3AfmF13Yaa	i dont know. but thats sad that they die from being cold :)|`|ycdkngxlaa	It's not that they can't afford to turn the heating up, they can't afford to use it at all, or they wouldn't have food to eat. For an old person a few blankets more than likely just won't do to keep them warm, they need heating too. Especially if they have problems like arthritis, as cold triggers this sort of condition off.    EDIT: From now on, at nights mostly but through the day too it's just going to get colder and colder so heating is going to be needed as we are in for a bad winter. I think there should be some help from the government or something for them.|`|8Bl0VUzeaa	Perhaps it's because they need to move around to stop joints becoming stiff & painful, or to go to the loo. How sensitive of you to ask this question considering the sacrifices the older generation made for this country during the war. This Government has betrayed our elderly like no Government before.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	I respect your question.  Many elderly live on such a tight budget that they may not have the extra blankets or could afford them..  Also, without some urging by friends or family members they might not think to layer their clothes.  This could be attributed to dementia.  The bottom line is that we all must help one another during hard times.  I know that the elderly generation are proud people who find it difficult to ask for help.  They may not be aware that there are programs that give blankets away or that most states have increased their heating assistance programs this year. If you are aware of anyone in this situation please take them to agencies that could help them.  It could be the difference between life and death.|`|AA10849898	I dont know where simpsond47 gets his info from but my money is NOt anything like he is saying. i have to manage on far less, and i do Not get the allowances he talks about. now with the heating and lighting and rent rising..and my money NOT rising..I am wishing I had that much as he incorrectly states!I just have to manage, like hundreds of others, who will not appreciate his deprecating remarks|`|NSz8Impmaa	A lot of pensioners are to mean to turn the heating up but will spend the money on fags and bingo.

I'm 50 years old and one or two blankets would do NOTHING to keep me warm.  To me you are being very insensitive and offensive toward older people.  They're are plenty of people of all ages that have to choose what they will spend their limited incomes on and sometimes that may be utilities.  God bless you if you ever find yourself in the same position.|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	They dont realize that they are getting as cold as they are and their bodies cant handle cold temps as well anymore. There is the same problem with heat stroke in the summer.   If a person cant afford their utilities, they need to look into other housing choices. They do have options if they are willing to consider them such as congregate living apartments where the heat bill is part of the subsidized rent. Some homes are in such bad repair that they are not energy efficient and cost too much to heat. |`|AA11908233	 You are seeing poverty in its ugliest form. I remember a few years back and elderly lady died in her bed while her slightly retarded son stayed up and kept fire in their small stove. Even with that fire the water beside her bed froze into ice.   There were problems with the floors, either dirt floors or floors with big holes allowing more cold into the house.|`|5fcb63ddb036024a80cdbdf4a1e4a372aa	For us, we have a limited income, and gas is so very high that we keep it turned down as much as possible.

We are eating less and less meat and less food in general.  We don't qualify for food stamps of anything else.  What can we do?  We live modestly, and we can't get by now.  So any suggestions you have would be appreciated.|`|AA10717870	Where do you keep YOUR thermostat in the winter?  Are you EVER so cold you could almost die?|`|1eb3e28bd69696148e318486959658ffaa	The stark choice for some is food or heat and while heat is a valuable commodity food is more important to sustain yourself.It is not just a matter of covering up many old people do put on extra clothes they don't walk around in a T shirt and complain of the cold. The body needs both food and warmth to survive and hypothermia is the creeping death that is almost unnoticed as it takes hold and kills indiscriminately.  There is a lot of fear and lack of knowledge about what can be done to save money on the fuel and the most common is to turn it off when there are so many other options like good insulation draught prevention and other things that could easily reduce their bills and give them the opportunity to have some degree of comfort.  What is the most saddening about this is that they often die quietly unnoticed and alone and that I am afraid is a sign of the greater social ills that have befallen us not just the inability to pay for fuel.  Adopt an old person in your street or neighbourhood drop in on them occasionally make them a hot drink have a chat I can think of nothing more likely to aid their demise than loneliness lack of social contact and the cold to seal their fate.|`|dUfRzO4maa	In my time, we had coal-fired ranges to keep warm. Thankfully, I live in a large Victorian house that still has one. Moreover, we would also put on more layers of clothing and use a hot water bottle.   |`|02sr7hNOaa	Shame the oldies in question don't do as their parents did before central heating etc. Use a hot water bottle or two under those blankets, and if you're religious pray for global warming to continue.
n7P70gweaa	I think the answer to this is relative.   If you are a young person then, of course, it's the oldsters that are the worst.   And conversely, We old folks know that "the youngin's got no respect, or proper upbringing like in our day."     Hey Lollicup: nice "tat". what is that? It looks like some kind of cresty,heart type of thing. did it hurt?|`|375432572adde7e904658c0aa0e5a4b2aa	There are good and bad people in all ages.

And if you look at a high school class of today, the personalities there are probably pretty good predictors of their personalities as old people.  Of course, illness and hardship can affect one's behavior, but that's true in high school too.  So to answer your question, they're about the same.  |`|a4LWildhaa	Sounds as if you are mad at your parents. People of any age group are as you described. |`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	I don't find old people to be snobby, rude or having a high opinion of themselves.  And if some of them do, it is most likely because they are in their sunset years, alone, and realize that most of their life is behind them.  So it would be understandable for them to often act that way.  They all just need someone to understand how they feel, someone to talk with and maybe reminisce with them.  As far as young people go, I have contact with lots of young people through my children and grandchildren, and I don't find them to be arrogant or noisy.  My grandchildren are ages 15 - 22, and I have five of them.  They are nice people.  However, if you find some that are like that, it is completely understandable in today's society.  I would not want to be a young person today, that is for sure.  Both groups just need understanding and someone to listen.  I know, I have been a young person and now I am an "older" person.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	I say they are equal.

Chemical imbalances are not rare among  the elderly, especially those on several different medications.    Youngsters suffer from lack of guidance and immaturity.  Look at the changes in our world in just the last thirty  years.  Parents have not been able to keep up with the  fast changing technology but it is a way of life for the kids.    TV teaches them all the quick, rude put downs.  That goes on  everyday, everyday.  Schools teach them to pass tests, but  very little in the way of life skills and manners.|`|gAiBzHS6aa	In my opinion for what it is worth, you are what you are, If you are arrogant, have that kiss my a****** attitude growing up, it becomes part of you.

They usually stick to jumping queues.|`|DJLeObm4aa	It's a true saying that 'You can't judge a book by its cover' and older people should not be judgemental about young people because of their style of dress or whatever. However it is a sad fact that it is mostly young people that commit crimes.  Now this is not because all old people are saintly but if they did behave like this when younger they often no longer have the health, ability or energy. Also old people have experienced being young but young people have not experienced being old. Although not totally inexcusable there are not many old people going around who are not in some sort of pain and even if they are able to walk, often cannot bend etc. it can be very difficult to have empathy for an older person if they are just old and grumphy but I think young people when ready to pounce should remember that unless they do not live to be old all the related problems are likely to happen to them one day.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	there are more young ones in prison.|`|yDrldEJHaa	I don't know where you met these old people but most that I have met aren't like that.

Younger people are still trying to figure out their own lives and living and learning from experiences to grow. Older people have this whole 'been there, done that' thinking that sometimes doesn't always work, especially when they just look down at all the younger children and adults. Personally, if I had to choose though...I would say older people, just because they have lived life differently than what a younger person has had to. Things have changed a lot throughout the years and some old people are just stuck in their old ways. It's just continuous...|`|K4IpvW8laa	I think that old people are rude about young people.

Both..........depends on who's view you are looking at.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	 There are good and bad attitudes in all generations.  I've met some elderly that are very bitter and snobbish.  I then stop and think about what may be causing this.  Empathy is a word that I feel everyone should understand the meaning of and put it to use every day.  One thing that concerns me about kids of today is a total lack of empathy.  Rudeness will take over unless they have had good role models as parents.  I work in a school and prior to that I was a correctional officer in a prison.  I only have two things that really set me off and it doesn't only concern kids.  One is talking on a cell phone while your trying to have a conversation with me. When this happens I just play deaf.  When they get upset about why I'm not answering, I politely ask them to end their phone conversation and I'll be glad to answer their question.  At my dad's funeral mass a cell phone rang during the services.  How rude is that?  I then realized that they probably just forgot to turn it off.  No big deal.  I'm sure that the reaction of everyone in the church should have been enough to embarass them, hopefully.    The other thing that really offends me are the baggy pants on guys that show most of their boxers and then watching them hang on to their crotch in order to keep up the pants.  Totally disgusting.  When I worked in the prison I could tell them to pull up their pants and if they didn't comply I could cite them with a violation.  I can't do this at the school because according to the Principal we can't single them out.    Note to apple.....the smell of piss and hanging on to a crotch in order keep your pants up appears to cross generations doesn't it?  Both are disgusting.|`|VpOGcG4maa	It's the individual and I believe it has to do more with nature and nurture then age...|`|hallarIxaa	Chance are if a person acted like an A hole when young they still will when they are old.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	Overall behavior is worst with the young people because they actually feel that they are smarter than the older ones which of course is not a fact.

Old people should know better and young people should be taught differently. |`|AA10525196	There's good and bad in both categories.  It's really a toss up.    Youth are being taught in the Government Controlled schools to think of their parents and the aged as old-fashioned with ideas that no longer apply to life.  Relativism is taught, a philosophy which is You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist, Friedrich Nietzsche.      It see the results all around me.  When I was a child I loved and respected my elders and most of us were taught values, standards and morals, including in my school. Our schools weren't inundated with this kind of brainwashing.    But, yes, I agree, old people can be snobby and rude, and this sure doesn't help youths' attitude toward us.  I think we need to realize that they'll soon be in Govt. authoritative positions deciding the fate of the world, including the elderly.  |`|5fcb63ddb036024a80cdbdf4a1e4a372aa	I've known some really nasty acting people of all ages.

511e769956285f81a8726696575d2cc1aa	Yo creo que no hay que reprimir ni sentimientos ni instintos, porque eso nos puede provocar un estado mental e incluso fsico bastante deplorable. Supongo que alguien puede creer que se puede generar hasta un tumor por estar toda la santa vida tragando quina. No s, a m me gusta soltar las cosas, aunque a veces hay que tener en cuenta si el que las va a escuchar est preparado, si vas a ganar algo hacindolo (no me refiero a beneficios personales, sin de la situacin general), si te vas a sentir mejor... todo es muy relativo en esta vida. Pero definitivamente reprimirse es malo.

Por ejemplo.    Reprimir sentimientos no es bueno para quien se reprime, porque no puede ser feliz, guardando "eso", pero por ah no le resulta posible expresarlos por una causa determinada y no logra otra cosa que reprimirlos. DE esa manera, para las dems personas, no "ven" esos sentimientos y se evita algo malo que pueda pasar o tambin algo bueno, dependiendo del caso. Si alguien siente algo por otra persona, que ya est comprometida o es muy feliz con su pareja, o sabe que nunca podr ser..., el expresarlo puede traerle problemas a todos, a menos que pueda ser expresado de manera "sana" y sea aceptado por cada uno.    Si los sentimientos son de celos, por ejemplo, reprimirlos, puede hacer bien a la otra persona, pero a uno lo puede destruir. Espresarlos, puede liberar a la persona celosa y lastimar o presionar a la persona celada.    Con respecto a los instintos, pasa algo parecido, pero esos instintos pueden estar manejados por un momento y luego no significar nada. Reprimirlos puede "ahorrar problemas", aunque lastime a quien los reprime.    En general, hay que medir esos sentimientos y esos instintos, si valen la pena o no.    En mi caso, me estoy reprimiendo desde hace mucho tiempo, esperando a que se desarrollara nuevamente un sentimiento en mi novia (que por muchas cuestiones estbamos alejados (aunque viviendo juntos y con muchas personas ms) y le descubr mensajes con otra persona, lo que me mat, no lo pude reprimir y se lo dije, as empez una serie de cosas, y ahora me quiere pero solamente como amigo. Debo reprimirme para no presionarla, pero me lastimo muchsimo. Y la dije, que si sale con otra persona, no voy a poder soportar los celos.    Me he reprimido muchas veces, algunas de sas, logr que pasara bien todo, salvo una frustracin en m. Otras, me lastim mucho, y al final no pude contenerme, con lo que se cre una situacin desagradable, tambin para m mismo. Hablando todo de sentimientos. Los instintos los he reprimido siempre y no encuentro con quin hablar de eso.    Si esa represin evita herir a alguien es buena, si lo lastima, es mala. Depender de cada caso, lo que es seguro, que a la parsona que los reprime, no le hace nada bien. Cuanto mucho puede tratar de canalizar esa energa por otro lado, con actividades, etc..    Saludos.
febe0c6287fa510d6fa3bec8bbe5201daa	"Religion of peace?" . . . Perhaps the words of current Islamic leaders can help us determine what is the truth about Islam . . .    In Iran, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used the comments to call for protests against the United States. He argued that while the pope may have been deceived into making his remarks, the words give the West an "excuse for suppressing Muslims" by depicting them as terrorists. "Those who benefit from the pope's comments and drive their own arrogant policies should be targeted with attacks and protests," he said, referring to the United States.    (Hmmm. . . Let's see now . . . If someone "Depicts muslims as terrorists" then they should be "Targeted with attacks and protests." according to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ~~~~ I think I get the picture.)    Al-Qaida in Iraq and its allies said Muslims would be victorious and addressed the pope as "the worshipper of the cross," saying "you and the West are doomed as you can see from the defeat in Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya and elsewhere. ... We will break up the cross, spill the liquor and impose the 'jizya' tax, then the only thing acceptable is a conversion (to Islam) or (being killed by) the sword."    (Hmmm . . . "Convert or get your head cut off with a sword" ~~~I think I get the picture.)    "You infidels and despots, we will continue our jihad (holy war) and never stop until God avails us to chop your necks and raise the fluttering banner of monotheism, when God's rule is established governing all people and nations," said the statement by the Mujahedeen Shura Council, an umbrella organization of Sunni Arab extremist groups in Iraq.    (Hmmm. . . "Infidels and despots will get their necks chopped" ~~~ Yes, I am sure I get the picture now. )    Or it might be that the comments of a man forced them to do it . . .    So far, protests over the pope's comments have been smaller. However, there has been some violence: Attackers hurled firebombs at seven churches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the weekend, and a nun was shot to death in Somalia.     (Hmmm, Where in the qu'ran does it say to shoot unarmed women if they are not muslim? ~~~ Yes, the picture is completely clear now.)    All honest at heart muslims should hang their heads in shame and denounce such vile, evil men and their words.     Where is the overwhelming denunciation by the Islamic world for these Islamic leaders and for the murders of innocent men, women and children? Millions of muslims remain silent, as silent as those that have been murdered in the name of Islam and it's Allah.     Instead the world is admonished "Islam is a religion of peace".     Yes, the whole world gets the picture now. . . and "peaceful" muslims are weighed in the balance and found guilty.|`|fe9091424adec7caaee44895e46f1a14aa	In the heart of a true Muslim there it lies, awaiting the day of judgement.

Heck what was Stalin all about anyway? What is Sadam Hussein? what was Hitler? ..nothing but products of what we the sit back and watch..."it may change"...people.

"Those of them with whom you made a treaty and then at every opportunity they break their treaty and they keep not duty to Allah, If you come on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, so that they may remember."     Here Mohammed's acts of planned terrorism against the Jewish Tribe is justified by Allah, because according to the "Merciful" Allah, Non-Muslims are the worst of BEASTS! So it is perfectly all right to murder, rape, torture and pillage the non-believers! Not only that but Allah is advising Mohammed and the Muslims that when anyone protests against the injustices committed by Muslims, the Muslims should make sure and deal with them with such violence, that it will strike fear among anyone who may think of supporting dissent. This proves that the Koran is nothing but a political manual for controlling people with terror.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  Koran 4:24   "And all married women are forbidden unto you EXCEPT those captives whom your right hand possesses. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that you seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery..."         In short Allah the All Merciful is saying "Hey Muslims, it's a crime to go after married women, but IF they happen to be your captives (which obviously all the non-Muslim women were) feel free to indulge yourself in rape and sexual torture of them. "lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned" Allah is making it LEGAL for Muslims to go ahead and rape Non-Muslim women by Divine Law!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  Koran 5:33        "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land Is: Execution, or Crucifixion, or the Cutting and Removing Off of hands and feet from OPPOSITE sides, or exile from the land: That is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter."     The gruesome spectacle of the Bedouin woman being torn apart, now makes sense. The act was DIRECTLY sanctioned by Allah himself in this Revelation.|`|4a3e514166c317f5349fc71585ad5e23aa	The peace is in the silence just after a suicide bomber explodes.

No el descanso despus del trabajo, sino el vivir en el mundo a costa de los dems.    Los dems pecados es cuestin de medida, si exageras seguro son pecado, pero en su medida no te tragues la moralina.    Ejemplo que es ?lujuria? que encuentres satisfaccin en el ejercicio del amor. Que quieras tener tus propias cosas.    La ira, como afecto desordenado es malo pero ?no es peor la tolerancia o el sometimiento ante la injusticia?    La gula, no existira como respuesta si no existiera la mala distribucin y sectores importantes de la humanidad pasaran hambre.      La codicia, depende de qu desees, si deseas cosas buenas que tiene de malo.    Hablemos de la soberbia, si es mala si te hace sentir superior a los dems y con derechos exclusivos que les niegas a los dems ?pero el orgullo de ti mismo, no es necesario? Si porque ests relativamente seguro de ti, te ocupas responsablemente de tus cosas de que orgullo me hablan. Te van a oponer la obediencia para que te sometas y si no lo haces te dirn Soberbia.    Repasando veo que me quede sin hablarte de la envidia. Si por tal es querer quedarte con las cosas de los dems y no lograr las tuyas seguro que no es buena, pero si ante la presencia de otras personas que tienen lo que tu mereces te sientes mal,  eso no es envidia, es que empezaste a darte cuenta de lo mal que se  distribuyen las cosas.    Tengo la impresin que esta nocin del pecado est en relacin con pretender someternos a criterios que benefician a los poderosos, a los que tienen todo, menos el sentido de la justicia.|`|ef6e99bc7fe463cbeba8a2d56c92251faa	yo creo q un poco con pereza y a veces con soberbia :P :O aunque se me pasa rapido :P|`|7a2f11f34b0a372bb84c0f367383c50eaa	pereza!!!|`|8e66b0d645f2f250081726ed856cbca4aa	creo que de codicia,..soy un poquito ambiciosa [pero solo un poquito]|`|41d71cd5d0f2d4d119fc0fa13e37eff3aa	Creo que lo mo es una soberbia pereza.|`|8b7278ba3a82640e89985d6db607f6dfaa	Ninguno.

4f0cd81d2ec75d84539080d16c5944b7aa	The definitions for Angel, Devil and Human as per Wikipedia Links are as under -    An angel is a supernatural being found in many religions. In scripture, they typically act as messengers, as held by the three prominent monotheistic faiths, Christianity, Judaism and Islam.    The Devil is the name given to a supernatural entity, who, in most Abrahamic faiths, is the central embodiment of evil. This entity is commonly referred to by a variety of other names, including Satan, Asmodai, Beelzebub, Lucifer and/or Mephistopheles. In classic demonology, however, each of these alternate names refers to a specific supernatural entity.  Satan frozen at the center of Cocytus, the ninth circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno.Christianity views Satan as an angel cast from heaven by God, for being prideful, deceitful, and the tempter.    Humans, or human beings, are bipedal primates belonging to the mammalian species Homo sapiens (Latin for "wise man" or "knowing man") under the family Hominidae (known as the great apes). Humans have a highly developed brain capable of abstract reasoning, language and introspection. This, combined with an erect body carriage that frees their upper limbs for manipulating objects, has allowed humans to make greater use of tools than any other species.    Like most primates, humans are by nature social. However, humans are particularly adept at utilizing systems of communication for self-expression and the exchange of ideas. Humans create complex social structures composed of co-operating and competing groups, ranging in scale from individual families to nations, and social interaction between humans has established a variety of traditions, rituals, ethics, values, social norms, and laws which form the basis of human society. Humans also have a marked appreciation for beauty and aesthetics which, combined with the human desire for self-expression, has led to cultural innovations such as art, literature and music.  Humans are also noted for their desire to understand and influence the world around them, seeking to explain and manipulate natural phenomena through religion, science, philosophy and mythology. This natural curiosity has led to the development of advanced tools and skills; humans are the only known species to build fires, cook their food, clothe themselves, and use numerous other technologies.    The first two - Angel and Devil are supernatural and imaginary entities, so the question of comparing them with Human is not at all arise. It has been defined how a human should be and behave, elobarately in various mythological documents and every one should try to be a good human being. This is the purpose of human coming to this world. Thank you.|`|10d20fde4f0386df56e1aee73c46b2b2aa	sorry to say but we only have PROOF of one of these creature actually exists....Humans....Devils and Angels are mythological creations of the primative human mind used as a way to explain things long before science was being used to rationalize things.

0f33c4be436a9e710c58869e346caf97aa	La razon por la cual al tener una igualdad tipo comunista se pierda la libertad es porque es un sistema utopico que no puede aplicarse a seres humanos reales por el simple hecho de que no somos iguales.     Una persona tiene mas habilidades que otra o le gusta trabajar mas que a otra. Entonces no es justo que por distintos niveles de trabajos y habilidades se recompence a las personas de la misma manera.     Obviamente, a las personas verses inmersas en estas injusticias comienzan a rebelarse contra el sistema y el sistema para poder sobrevivir comienza a quitar las libertades a la ciudadania.     El comunismo no hace a todos iguales si no hace a todos igualmente pobres.

AA10726062	Cuanto menos de lamentables. Sin embargo no califican en una competencia por el predominio de la intolerancia religiosa.    En realidad ciertas competencias no tienen ganadores. El actual Papa de la iglesia Catlica, con su antecedente en las juventudes hitlerianas, debera ser mucho ms cauto a la hora de hacer comentarios como los que realiz.     Tanto el islm como el cristianismo, y en particular el catolicismo, tienen una extensa historia de intolerancia decorada con la legalizacin de la violencia como forma de imponer la fe de cada quien.     La larga lista va de la jihad a las cruzadas, pasando obviamente por los thalibanes y la inquisicin.

Que sabe IGNACIO DE TEOLOGIA. ?Que sabe el sapo de freno? ?Cul es la obsesin de Ignacio con Jess y la religin? ?De donde saca sus falacias? De su propia mente.    Aqu les va otro ejemplo de lo que escribi IGNACIO anteriormente  y mi respuesta a su falsedad:    IGNACIO (IGNACIORANTE)  IGNACIO  S que est de moda entre los evanglicos decir que Jess fund una religin y la iglesia catlica fund otra diferente.    La realidad es un tanto ms complicada.    En la poca en que se expandi el imperio romano, alrededor del siglo I AEC se produjo en todos los territorios conquistados un fenmeno conocido como Sincretismo Religioso. Es decir, se tomaron partes de diferentes religiones y supersticiones para formar versiones nuevas de religiones antiguas.    RESPUESTA: Noten Como IGNACIO usa la expresin Antes de Cristo (a. C) dando el mismo y la historia evidencia de que Cristo existi. El sincretismo al que IGNACIO se refiere fue combatido por los apstoles, pero el no lee los relatos bblicos. En segundo lugar el no cita la fuente de donde escribe sus mentiras (esos datos son falsos).   IGNACIO  Hoy en da ese fenmeno se ve todo el tiempo; desde las clases altas que adoptan ideas new-age para agregarlas a su catolicismo tradicional, hasta los danzantes de Tonantzin que van a la baslica a adorar a la virgen de Guadalupe.    En aquellas pocas los soldados romanos tenan varios cultos, entre ellos el culto a Mitra y a Dionisio; los cuales, al provenir indirectamente de la religin egipcia (Dionisio y Mitra eran versiones modernas de Osiris) combinaban perfectamente con la mitologa Juda.    RESPUESTA: Falso amigo, los judos son tan celosos con su religin que para tu asombro es la ms antigua que existe y permanece igual. Aparte de eso tu desconoces la diferencia entre judasmo y cristianismo.  IGNACIO  Un creyente en estas nuevas doctrinas sincretistas, llamado Saulo, describi las andanzas de un Mesas que cumpliera todas las profecas judas y que casualmente coincida con todas las caractersticas de los hombres-dioses de las religiones paganas. A este hombre le llam Joshua, el Chrestus. Saulo escribi su epistolario en alguna fecha posterior al a?o 70 CE.    Lo interesante es que Saulo nunca conoci a este hombre-dios, ni siquiera dijo que hubiera sido una persona de carne y hueso; era otro ms de los hijos de un dios y una mujer que abundaban en las leyendas de la poca.    RESPUESTA: Ignoras que Saulo fue judo de religin en un tiempo y despus de su encuentro con JESUCRISTO se convirti al cristianismo (Hhc. 9). Pablo no le nombr Jeshua, este nombre se lo dio Dios antes de nacer. Saulo reconoce a Cristo como un hombre que vino en carne (Ro. 1:13; Col. 1:22) de cual Saulo tu hablas?   IGNACIO  Posteriormente se puso de moda escribir versiones sobre la vida de este hombe-dios en la tierra. Hay incluso obras de autores cristianos (Justino) que lo comparan con los hijos de Jpiter.    RESPUESTA: en vez de IGNACIO debo llamarte IGNORANTE. La cristiandad no usa la literatura apcrifa para demostrarla verdad de JESUCRISTO. En cuanto a las herejas, esas seguirn por personas como tu que no saben lo que dicen y creyendo ser doctores, son detractores de la Verdad.  IGNACIO  Esta es la fase del cristianismo que surge sin la iglesia catlica.    Posteriormente, con las comunicaciones, se empieza a dar el fenmeno que el cristianismo se pone de moda entre las clases altas. Los cristianos dejan de ser los perseguidos y empiezan a perseguir a los habitantes de las aldeas (paganus) que seguan teniendo sus religiones sincretistas.    En el a?o 325 el emperador Constantino llama a todos los ministros cristianos prominentes y les pide ponerse de acuerdo en sus creencias para poder crear una religin oficial para todo el imperio romano. Quera hacer esto para evitar el desmembramiento que se produca de su imperio.    Los ministros se reunieron y decidieron por todos menos dos votos en contra declarar que Jess no era un hijo de los dioses como todos los dems que existan en esa poca, sino que haba sido de la misma sustancia de dios y por tanto era dios en la tierra.    RESPUESTA. IGNACIORANTE, La Iglesia ya exista y Constantino lo que hizo fue dejar de perseguir  a la cristiandad. All es donde nace una iglesia universal o catlica, pero no como la conocemos hoy da. Para el caso, si Pedro fuera el primer Papa, porque los sacerdotes no se casan, si la Biblia dice que Jess san la suegra de Pedro, porque era casado. En cuanto al supuesto mito de Cristo, de donde irresponsablemente tu sacas es dato? De tu mente y corazn da?ado o de un compinche tuyo.   IGNACIORANTE  De paso deciden declarar la religin cristiana como la religin universal (catlica) en todo el imperio romano.    Con esto se inicia oficialmente el oscurantismo, que cost a la civilizacin occidental 1000 a?os de retraso.    Tambin en esta poca es que se "siembra" la nica "prueba" que existe que demuestra la existencia de Jess. El testimonio de Flavio Josefo. Historiador Judo que escribi la obra "Antiguedades de los Judos". En esa obra se inserta burdamente un prrafo que hace mencin de Jess y con eso se le convierte de un personaje de leyenda en uno de carne y hueso que camin la tierra.    RESPUESTA. La Iglesia no necesita a Josefo, la iglesia tiene testigos oculares que escribieron en una fecha bien cercana a Cristo y tu dices que no hay otra evidencia. Tu estas loco. Tu niegas los evangelios que son escritos antiguos y confiables y aparte que se escribieron precisamente para evitar escrituras apcrifas.

AA12005749	I am a person with gender nonconformity, and I also became gay at around 5. People are not born gay. The show on 60 Minutes upset me by saying that they thought they could prove that gender nonconformity was a pre requisite to being gay. That is not the truth, They are separate issues. It may be that a gender nonconformity is caused by some hormone, but it is not the same as forming a sexual attraction on the same gender. I see the agenda used to justify homosexuality and it is a lie being fed to America. I also want to clarify that some children learn characteristics that mimic a gender nonconformity.   A child does not have to have a born or learned gender nonconformity to form a sexual attraction on same gender, or even something a part of the same gender.  But because of uninformed parents or children, they that have a born, and some of those with a learned gender nonconformity often believe they are gay, or often called or told they are gay and this also is an influence on a child to become sexually attracted to same gender. Often those with a more learned gender nonconformity will grow out of the characteristics that cause a gender nonconformity. Remind you that not all the children with a born gender non conformity will become gay.|`|fa4c9ae2dff93eeedb6c95e6b56166cdaa	I could give a long speech about it since I have a A.B. in Psychology.

If you want to come to God He is waiting on you, gay or straight.Its not the person, it is the SIN!!!!!!!.|`|b70599a0829dd4deed571c9132f73590aa	what exactly is your question?  I didn't get a chance to see the show, but being gay is definitely due to genetics/hormones....it is not at all a choice.  most religious people are not homophobes, but there are, unfortunately, those extreme, right-wing bible thumper types who "use" religion to justify hating us.  you can be both Christian and homosexual.  I am, as well as all my gay/lesbian friends. being homosexual and being Christian are not mutually exclusive as many extremists insist.|`|AA10053427	religion? children? homosexuality? I'm finding it hard to find the question here.|`|AA11798742	They always find a medical reason for bad behavior.  Sex is 90% in the mind.  So it is because of the way a person begins to think.  They also say that Alcoholism is a disease.  Yet people can quit.  The bible condems homosexuality, and destroyed Sodom and Gamorrah for that very reason.  Why would the maker of all humans destroy someone for something that they couldn't help.?  That doesn't make any sense.  It said they had come to be past all moral sense.  Why in certain areas of the country there is more than others?  Because in some areas it is more accepted.  If they couldn't help it why would it make a difference?|`|b752d0a653b61821fd024962041eb435aa	Is there a question you're asking? Or just making a statement?|`|AA12362459	yeah your right. We are sometimes unintelligent when it comes to dealing with the sin of homosexuality or lesbianism. They have souls that needs salvation just like every other sinner. And whether they claim they were born gay or not, Jesus said Marvel not you must be born again. Lets try to win souls for the kingdom. We've driven enough people away from the church|`|82804e7b4f3aebf3f248883642b12f81aa	It is a proven fact that SOME people are born "gay"  The female hormone is called Estrogen and the male hormone is called Testestosterone.  Both males and females are born with both hormones.  If a male has more estrogen then normal, chances are he is going to have more femanine qualaties etc, and possibly be gay and vice versa.   THIS IS A SCIENTIFICIALLY PROVEN FACT!  There is nothing anyone can say that makes this false, so with this said, and with the fact that god makes all humans in his image.  Why would he knowingly make any child a homosexual, espicially knowing what he does to people who are homosexuals?
da316bf76c64c4ead3745ca1f6fe19fcaa	Hola becca; mira me parece que es algo interior y que el ser humano no puede describir; eso se debe a que somos muy incrdulos y que creemos en cuanto algo superior de nosotros y eso es lo que nos aleja del amor de Dios.

Es el Dios de tu Corazn.    TODO el mundo tiene Fe en el Dios de su Corazn. La Biblia, lo que nos cuenta es como sentan a Dios esas personas y esas Gentes.   Con suerte, la Experiencia de esas personas nos puede ayudar a comprender al Dios de nuestro corazn un poco mejor.  Y si no hay suerte, la blibia nos confundir, que todo es posible.    Pero al Dios en el que tengo Fe, en el que todos tienen Fe. Es en el que siento en mi corazn. En el que cada uno siente en su corazn.    Como dijo Jeremias 31:31 ""Vienen das, orculo de Yav, en que yo har con la casa de Israel y la de Juda una alianza Nueva. No como la Alianza que hice con sus padres el da en que los tom de la mano para sacarlos de Eqgipto. La alianza que har con la casa de Israel ser as: Pondr mi ley dentro de ellos, en su corazn la escrbir y ser su Dios y ellos sern mi pueblo. No tendr que instruirse dicindose unos a otros "?Conoced a Yav!" porque me conocern todos, chicos y grandes, orculo de Yav; yo perdonar su mandad y no me acordar ms de sus pecados."      Ese tiempo se cumpli al morir Cristo en la Cruz. Por eso Todos tienen Fe en el mismo Dios, en el que sienten en su corazn. Ya llamen a ese Dios "Dios" o Al, o incluso por otros terminos como "Universo" o "Inteligencia Infinita".    Pero llame el hijo al Padre por el nombre que sea, el Padre ser siempre el mismo.|`|d20005750847c7d8599e960372568462aa	No, no en el que crearon los hombres a su imagen y semejanza, el ser humano es muy engredo.
