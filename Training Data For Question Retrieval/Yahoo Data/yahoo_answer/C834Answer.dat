I40vnqNyaa	No amount of healthy eating can make smoking ok for your body. Hundreds of carcinogens entering and invading your body doing you damage. Everyone knows smoking is a killer.  Not only that smoking costs a fortune and makes you stink.  I cant think of one reason why anyone would want to  smoke these days. So even though i cant agree with eating loads of crap I would have to say given the choice its still better than smoking.     Once you have given up you will need to eat foods high in antioxidants,  as they are what are needed to fight and reverse the effects of all the free radical damage you now have as a result of smoking.|`|AA10025824	The smoking will kill you.  But, over time the eating crap will kill you too.  Guess it depends on your heredity.|`|UspK4SQBaa	The smoking and eating well.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. Smoking & not eating any foods you like. Peace|`|z01moLIvaa	smoking can do quite a lot of damage even if you do eat good. Healthy foods aren't good enough to counteract the damages done by smoking. The best thing that you can do is quit smoking completely, but even then, the damage that has been done can't be reversed. So you're stuck with a shortened life  I would pick the nonsmoking path|`|y1TDricRaa	definitly smoking a pack a day is worse.|`|bYU77eteaa	smoking and eating well  My friend's father was diagnosed with Lung Cancer and then died 4 months later...very shocking...at least you can reverse problems like weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol...can't reverse lung cancer...its a death sentence|`|ZTNMhcyJaa	Smoking is worse... organic food and all that crap doesn't do anything it's a scam for your money.|`|tBdceRrPaa	I would prefer high cholesterol over lung cancer any day.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	option A.|`|VP8TiqEmaa	Depends on the person some people can eat crap and it doesn't effect them. But generally id say smoking a pack a day, also since when are organic foods any different then normal foods?    Thats just stupid hype to get people to pay the Premium. Dumb people buy organic food thinking its better for them and the environment. And I can say one thing organic food is bad for the environment.    Organic food requires more land more land needed to feed our growing population thus say bye bye amazon rain forest Ikemen needs his organic couscous|`|DsH1EJ0Eaa	EATING BADLY U CANT GET CANCER FROM THATTT
AA10698792	Yes!  I made some to give as gifts this past Christmas. I used Dried Ancho Chiles, Aleppo Pepper, regular red pepper flakes from the super market, and fresh roasted red peppers in addition to the other ingredients. (I used garlic, caraway seeds, coriander, cumin and salt in addition to the peppers and olive oil)    You can make Harissa from just about any peppers you can find so if you can't find Guajillo just find another pepper with a similar heat rating.  This chart may help: http://www.foodsubs.com/Chiledry.html    If you still can't find anything with the same heat rating, use one that's hotter and mellow the batch with roasted red peppers...wash and cut red peppers in half removing the seeds and ribs,  toss with a little olive oil and roast skin side up in a 375 degree oven until the skin blisters and blackens just about all over. Do not turn them.  Take the peppers out and seal them in a zip lock bag for about 20 to 30 minutes and when you take them out the skins should come off fairly easily.  If they're too slippery, use a paper towel to help pull them off.    The hotness of your Harisa is a personal thing so you'll have to taste it as you go to determine if you'd like more garlic, more heat, less heat, etc.  You can always add more heat with more hot peppers or take some away with the roasted ones.  Any roasted peppers you don't use can be used on sandwiches or tossed with pasta or frozen in a zip loc bag until you need them.    PS I find it kind of interesting that the previous answerer is "poo-pooing" the use of mexican chiles in Harisa, yet he serves it with Ethiopian food when Harisa is Tunisian!|`|mzk0t6Ovaa	Never heard of harissa made with pasilla or guajillo. . .  Usually,   at least from my experience, it's made with hot red chiles, coriander,  garlic, and possibly cumin.  When I do harissa, I use my Fatalii  peppers, roasted over an open flame, and they're blazingly hot.    I really don't think you can do a proper "harissa" chiles pasillas  or guajillos.    If you can't get "African" chiles, Thai Dragons, Long Cayenne, and  even Red Habaneros all work well - you'll pick up some fruity (like  peach or apricot) notes from the habaneros, but the heat and overall  flavors are more appropriate than the "Mexican" chiles.    Not sure how others use harissa, and I know it's not traditional, but  I serve it when I cook Ethiopian foods.  Most often it's used as an   appetizer, but I prefer it as a condiment to complement couscous,  injira, and lentils.    Whatever you do, just get in there and have fun with it.
A5gfxSyzaa	You really need to do a lot of research before choosing veganism as a way of life.  Vegan, by definition, is not just about the food you eat but everything you use.  It means no leather, no tallow candles, no honey, no wool, etc.    What do you eat?  Whole grains, fruits, veggies, beans, peas, lentils, nuts.  No dairy or eggs, and that includes things like whey which is in many processed foods. Earthbalance is a great faux butter.  Olive oil is great to cook with.  You need to be careful on refined sugar, since some companys filter they sugar through charcoal made of chared animal bones.|`|6vlNSK3uaa	I think meat tastes really good.|`|KC5vBg4uaa	I eat a lot.  It was easier than I thought.  I did have a transition stage though where I would eat only shellfish.  Tofu with terriyaki sauce is good, vegetable pizzas with no cheese, pasta with sauce, veggie burgers, veggie hot dogs, bagels with margarine, cupcakes with egg replacers, soy ice cream, etc...  Then of course fruit and vegetables.  Try not to be too strict at first.  Get more strict as you go,  But if you don't know if a food you have contains something you can't have and are not able to find out easily, just eat it.    Also, I understand many vegans' concerns with honey, but a disgusting fact is that almost all foods you eat contain dead bug particles.  Bugs get killed all the time in plant harvesting and their legs and such make it into your food.  Also, driving, digging up Earth, etc... kills bugs.  Plus, most scientific studies show that insects don't really "feel" pain in the normal sense of the word due to the lack of a central nervous system.  So make your own decision about honey, but I personally think it's fine.|`|7pgwWoUlaa	If wanna know about Nutritional Benefit.  that is here.........  http://here-under.blogspot.com/2009/01/n...|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	basically fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans. its a whole lot of food    over 12 thousand VEGAN recipes  http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes.php?ca...|`|DauMaNUjaa	If you need to ask this question, you haven't researched the vegan diet.

YQTBQ5xyaa	1)  Portobellos ARE average mushrooms.  They are the same species of shroom as the white button mushrooms, the Italian brown mushrooms and Crimini mushrooms.  They are just bigger.  The button mushrooms are the baby version of portobellos. (scientific name:  Agaricus Bisporus).  They have a bit more "earthy" flavor than the smaller ones.    2)  Cook them anyway you want to.  I chop 'em up and saute them.|`|q4ppgGe1aa	1) They taste pretty much the same as regular mushrooms to me, but maybe a bit stronger and better. :)  2) I've never heard of steaming mushrooms, but I don't see why not! If you've done it with other mushrooms then it'll work with portobellos.|`|8Wqbz6FMaa	It has a richer mushroom taste than your button mushrooms.  It is earthy and beefy.  I would rather grill them than steam them though.  You can make a mushroom burger with a whole grilled portobello.  It is also great sauteed in olive oil or butter with some garlic.  Or you can dice it and add it to your favorite stew.
qWqg7vFJaa	Fried with runny yolks will be fine thanks mate.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	I like boiled eggs best. I rear my own free range hens and ducks so I'm spoiled for choice for fresh eggs.  Duck eggs don't taste any different to hen eggs when they are raised free range. Its the commercially produced duck eggs that can taste a little "strong" I think they feed them on fish meal?    The best poached egg for me is a duck egg, about 4 or 5 days old. Any fresher and its not "set" properly and the white goes too loose in the boiling water. After 12 days or so the same applies, but at around 4-7 days the eggs stays compact.     Add a drop or 2 of vinegar to the pan before you add the egg, crack it in a glass first then slip it in the water once its boiling. About 4 minutes is perfect.|`|reGQJnKCaa	sunny side up eggs tossed on toast|`|swJuTXcSaa	fertilised|`|928cc95900045af613958930fcbc438daa	Fried on a bagel with bacon and a giant mushroom|`|VEQaOzK5aa	i like myn wif a kiss boiled or fryed im saticfied as long as i get my kiss :)|`|45f50f01a43af0d0207afc5896c6b22caa	Hard boiled chopped up in a cup with a pinch of salt and a knob of butter then fired on a morning roll.

D80xt8Xiaa	Personally i think it's just a case of drinking too much, people all say about mixing drinks but doesnt affect me.<br>  <br>  I think the worry about mixing drink might just be an urban myth thats evolved because generally the people who mix their drinks are the ones drinking the most.<br>  <br>  Though i stand to be proved wrong...|`|7B9KEqCnaa	I think the saying is beer before liquor never sicker liquor before beer never fear.  My personal theory is that when you drink beer first you have all this beer in your stomach and then you add liquor and all the beer just mixes with the liqour and the beer turns basically into the liquor and then it all hits you at once.  But if you drink liquor first, you tend not to drink as much beer because your already buzzing from the shots.|`|6ELymetXaa	You don't get sick from mixing liquor with beer, you only get sick when you drink too much.|`|P00NHhCGaa	well, you must always remember that Liquor must be almost entirely alone in your stomach to move into your bloodstream, or the food in your stomach pretty much digested. Just like if you have a full stomach after eating, then you start hitting the Jack, You wont really feel it for about eh, 30 minutes or less, it really depends on your metabolism. Anyways, you'll have a slight buzz from the liquor, and by the time you start wondering why you drank so much and you didn't feel anything, you'll be drunk on the floor, puking your guts all over the place. I think it works the same with beer, because beer is malt and hops based, with all the grain, so it acts as a wheat, or bread being digested first, even though it's mixed with the liquor, so the liquor hits you all at once.|`|Q4XxrApVaa	You don't. It is a myth. People have attributed "Beer before liquor never been sicker" to the fact that you drink beer much quicker than hard liquor. So when you switch from beer to hard liquor, people tend to continue to drink at the same pace, consume too much alcohol too quickly, and get sick.

If it has the same amount of caffeine as chocolate milk, it might be about 4 mg of caffeine.    http://coffeetea.about.com/library/blcaf...    Hot cocoa has about 3-15 mg of caffeine (depending on how much chocolate is in it).     http://www.cspinet.org/new/cafchart.htm    It's a rather small amount, no matter which list you believe.

AA12031316	How can any kind of "slaughter" be "humane"?  Just doesn't compute.

Other than that, there are none.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Most slaugter houses use a "knocker" which is a air-powered device that shoots a bolt into the cow's head and kills it almost instantly.  Many chickens are killed by shocking them.  Slaughter houses do not raise cows; the process them, so the most a cow will be around is just a day or two at most.    Kosher foods ust be killed in humane ways also under supervision.  Chickens killed kosher have their necks cut and are drained of most of their blood with them hanging from a moving chain.
AA12357988	The reasons probably very from person to person.    I personally can't bake.  I'm ok at it, and better at some things than others.  I just have little interest in it, and hate having to follow recipes to a tee.  If I understood the logistics of baking, I might enjoy it better.    I do, however, LOVE to cook.  And I am very very good at it.  My best meals are always the ones that I throw together, and rarely the ones that I have to use a recipe from.  Sure, everything I cook is good, but I have extremely high standards when it comes to food, moreso when I am the one to prepare it.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Probably because they have no interest in it; and their mother probably didn't take the time to make interesting meals.  Anyone can cook, who can follow a recipe and has an ounce of creativity.  You just need to follow a recipe once, and then adapt it as you like it.

If you cannot afford to do this with 7 people 4 people is a better number and much more affordble.

It will be such as fun day for you and your friends and I dont know about you but almost every 14 year old I know would absolutely LOVE this idea! Now once again it is expensive so you can choose what you will let the girls get done depending on how much money you want to spend. Then of course top it off with a dinner out with the girls after and then if you are up to it have them over for a sleepover.

Food is the best place to get yoru nutrition.  Eat a wide variety of foods, not the same thing every single day.  Include LOTS of fresh fruits and fresh or frozen veggies in your diet, too.  Tons of nutrition there.  Dry beans/peas are a great source of fiber, which help make you feel fuller so you eat less, and also keep your insides running smoothly.  Dont' forget about lowfat dairy products (milk, chz, yogurt) and lean meats and eggs for good quality protein.|`|75ZxAANkaa	the best foods you can eat are alot of raw vegetables. lots of salad with romaine lettuce that has more vitamins in it, broccoli is great.     and if you want to get rid of cravings for sugar bake a sweet potato in the oven and you can eat it. it gets rid of your cravings just like that. i do it all the time and it is good for me. you can eat it warm or cold and it taste like candy.    try and get your vitamins out of food instead. it is way better for you. and the less sugar you eat the more your body will absorb all the vitamins you eat and it will do your body wonders.

Lard is the name for pig fat, and only pig fat.|`|8Wqbz6FMaa	Because you should be eating it with a spoon as you would a cup of jello.  You probably prefer it hot and liquid and keep it in a thermos.|`|AA10379496	Cow lard would be cow fat, obviously. It's not as common as lard from pigs and thus does not have it's own name. You can find it in some obscure health shops and Asian food outlets. It's relatively nutrient dense when compared to pig lard, so it's a more healthy alternative. However, it is more costly to produce, especially since cows are utilized mainly for beef and dairy products. The rise in prices of cow feed also contribute to the expense, production costs are around $4 per pound as of Dec. 2008.  Some health food companies are looking into making oils and butter/margarine-like products from cow lard. Although most people don't usually drink straight cow lard, it can be beneficial to ones health.

AA12239026	Interesting question.    I can tell you that the grower of organic produce in my area is having a very difficult time even finding seeds that have not been genetically modified.    Irradiation is another problem of our food source that you might want to do some study in.  In the USA, they don't even have to let you know that such has been done to your food that you just purchased.    As to specific companies, I can't think of one that isn't in the food business that isn't involved in some shape or form under the guise of supposedly making an 'improvement' of their crop/product.|`|AA12031316	ALL of the major brands you see in grocery stores are a part of the gmo process, as well as the drug manufacturers.  Read any commercially produced food label, and you will find at least one ingredient actually labeled as "modified", such as food starch, corn starch, etc), but the majority of ingredients are not labeled as such.  If you want a REAL eye opener to the status of our "food" supply, go purchase the nicest piece of produce you can find in your grocery store (anything from a head of cabbage or lettuce, ear of corn, etc)  Take it to your local college lab and ask them to assess the DNA in it.  You will find the DNA of all sorts of weird things that simply do NOT belong in the human food chain-and ALL of the big business, such as Kraft, General Mills, and all the rest are going right along with it.  Monsanto is the granddaddy but the whole industry is supporting it, as are unsuspecting consumers.  Most people don't have a clue that their food is no longer natural.  I certainly didn't, until I decided to get to the bottom of my chronically poor health.  Only after MUCH research, and years of studying to get my degree in nutrition, did I learn what was really going on.  I had no idea when I was buying veggies and fruits that I thought were healthy, that I was actually buying stuff that had been genetically modified.  Its a very deceitful practice that the government totally endorses.  Its not likely that our grandchildren will have access to any "real" food.  GMO has pretty much already taken over.  The seeds from GMO foods are planted the next year, and often re-modified with even more stuff to make up for the deficiencies created in the previous crop.  There won't be much left for our children.  By the way, once I quit consuming commercial stuff, and switched to a totally organic, and mostly homegrown diet, ALL of my chronic health problems vanished.  I am now perfectly healthy, after years of being sick and crippled.  Thats more than enough proof for me!

After the tin was opened the food could and did become contaminated by the lead and people were poisoned this way.  It is no longer true today but some pieces of history inevitably live on.|`|ARA3GDbLaa	it probably isn't healthy for you, but i don't think it would kill you...  but it definitely would taste kinda weird  i think it's b/c in the can, it's sealed airtight, but when you open it, bacteria and germs and whatnot can get into the can....|`|MIZi6GLeaa	yes, because, as everyone knows, open cans in the fridge attract Ninjas who will then poison you!|`|XHnpraaxaa	I know the tin use to be made of odd metals but thought that was changed to make it safer today. BUT after all the stuff going on today I would be very careful and not use it this way.  Best to store it in another container once opened.|`|I40vnqNyaa	Why risk it?  When you have opened a can of food and you're not using all the food straight away its just as easy to empty the food into a bowl, or other container, and put it in the fridge.    Don't store food in an opened tin can, or re-use empty cans to cook or store food. This is because when a can has been opened and the food is open to the air, the tin may transfer more quickly to the can's contents.  This is a quote from this website. http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/keepingfoodsaf...      Nowadays the cans for foods are sealed inside with a kind of lacquer to minimise the probability of contamination with lead. The contamination depends additionally on the storage time and acidity of the content. But contamination is very reduced compared with old cans without inside coat. Do not buy cans that are damaged or disfigured in some way. Never use food from rusty cans But when a can is opened and the inside of the can comes into contact with oxygen in the air, corrosion, which is minimal while a can is sealed, occurs more rapidly. And while opening a can, you might hurt the seal.The best is to put the leftovers in another container made for foods. This quote came from here.  http://www.eufic.org/web/page.asp?cust=1...|`|IDVFsy5waa	no i dont think so..|`|e8NonLfAaa	I don't know if it's true or not, but the can of beans will definately end up tasting like the other contents of the fridge.... which would be gross.|`|PhPOLgHGaa	if it is just left in can for a little while say over nite it will not really be harmful..but its just as easy to put it in a small container. i have put open cans in the fridge all the time and well i am still here kickin and breathing as well as the ppl i have cooked for..lol.so it cant be all bad. i think perhaps just because of the tin...after a while if left open in fridge to long it just tends to get the can taste....but we never got sick......

AA10928232	You must be in the UK... meaning biscuit is a cookie to you?    Ginger Spice Cookies  From Food Network Kitchens    Yield: About 3 dozen cookies, depending upon shape  Prep time: 1 hour  Cook time: 14 to 18 minutes  Inactive prep time: 2 hours 30 minutes  Ease of preparation: Intermediate    1-inch knob peeled fresh ginger or 2 tablespoons   prepared ginger juice   3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  3/4 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon fine salt  1 tablespoon ground ginger  2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  2 teaspoons ground allspice   1/2 teaspoon freshly and finely ground black pepper   1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature cut into pieces   1 cup superfine sugar  2/3 cup molasses, preferably sorghum     Icing:  1/4 cup water  3 tablespoons egg white powder  2 cups confectioners' sugar  Food coloring, sprinkles, candies, or colored sugars   as desired    Puree the ginger in a mini food processor with 2 tablespoons water. Squeeze and strain juice through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer. Discard the ginger pulp. Reserve the juice.     Sift the flour, baking soda, salt and spices into a medium bowl, then whisk in the pepper; set aside.     Cream the butter and sugar with a handheld mixer until light and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add the molasses and ginger juice and beat until evenly incorporated, about 2 minutes. (Stir together with a spatula if needed.) Gradually blend the dry ingredients on low speed into the butter mixture until you have a crumbly mixture. Bring the dough together by hand pressing and kneading lightly until moist, but not tacky. Divide into 2 equal portions, press into disks about 1/2-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight.     Position racks evenly in the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.     Dust the dough and a work surface with flour. Roll the dough about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out cookies into desired shapes. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake until the cookies are a rich tawny brown, about 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on a rack.     For decorating: Whisk the water and egg white powder in a medium bowl until foamy and smooth. Gradually whisk in the confectioners' sugar to make a smooth icing. For multiple colors divide the icing into batches and add a food coloring as desired. Spread or pipe the icing onto the cookies. Finish with sprinkles, or candies. Let rest on a rack until the icing sets, about 30 minutes.

J0Pid1tyaa	Depends on what you consider Vegan friendly. There is a "zoo" of sorts at Walt Disney World. It is called Disney's Animal Kingdom. It is a hotbed of controversy because when the park first opened several animals' in Disney's care died. If you look it up on the internet I'm sure you can get more detailed information. I haven't heard anything recently about the park being neglectful. I believe that after the controversy Disney did their best to improve this park's image. This park can always be avoided it looking at animals in zoos makes you uncomfortable. I am fairly certain that there is a show that uses live birds. It may not be running any longer due to budget constraints though.    Also, at EPCOT there is a large aquarium called The Living Seas. Again, you would have to decide if looking at fish behind glass goes against your vegan principles. Another part of EPCOT that may make you uncomfortable is the ride entitled Living With the Land. It is a boat ride through a hydroponic greenhouse. As a vegetarian I was very much enjoying myself until the ride took a nasty turn in "aquaculture". You see all these fish crammed into these small tanks swimming in circles. Also, there are tanks of gators waiting to be harvested for someone's new purse. The ride;s narration does not try to hide what these fish an alligators are going to be used for.     There are other instances where animals are used around the parks. Parrots are on display in Downtown Disney by the Rainforest Cafe. Horses pull trolleys down Main Street U.S.A., and  other little things that a Vegan may not appreciate.     As far as restaurants and eating Disney is very vegan friendly. They will take special orders as long as they are made in advance. If you show up at any restaurant and say you are a vegan they will accommodate you but the meal may be uninspired.    Good luck. It may be as simply as avoiding the parts of the park that you do not agree with. I am a vegetarian and spent my honeymoon at Disney. It was a wonderful experience. Good luck.|`|b2261d1342601255ca19eb8cac0fdf39aa	There is animal and human exploitation. (most of the animals are animatronic but there are some real ones I believe) They probably do have some vegetarian food but I don't remember them having vegan options other than maybe salad (which is nothing) I would avoid Disney World it is not really vegan friendly nor are they really queer friendly and I think they also might have some problems with people of color (though I think they are getting a bit better in those regards)  Have fun in whatever you do!|`|llkSmgLJaa	Anyone who has a mouse for a mascot must be veg friendly.

I can tell you that they have vegetarian and vegan options for food choices.  That actually have options to meet the many dietary needs of the wide variety of people that visit there from all over the world.  You just have to check at the different venues that are out there and ask since all options are not at each eatery.
AA11443075	Drunk Driver    It's not a practical game where you go out and play it, but it's a fun card/drinking game.     Drunk Driver is a game that requires only a deck of cards, two people and a ready supply of your favorite beverage. To begin play, one person has to decide to be the driver and one the dealer. Once this monumental decision has been made, the dealer places 7 cards face down in a straight vertical line on the table, with the first card closest to the driver and the last card closest to the dealer. The driver begins by turning over the card closest to him or her and carrying out the action denoted by the card shown.     If the card is a 2 through 9 then the card is safe and the driver turns over the next card. If the card is a 10 then the dealer adds one card to the end of the line of cards. If the card is a Jack then the driver takes one drink and the dealer adds two cards to the end of the line. If the card is a Queen then the driver takes two drinks and the dealer adds three cards to the end of the line. If the card is a King then the driver takes three drinks and the dealer adds four cards to the end of the line. If the card is an Ace then the driver takes four drinks and the dealer adds five cards to the end of the line.     The object of the game is for the driver to successfully turn over all of the cards that are lying face down on the table before the dealer has dealt out all of the cards in the deck. So optimally, the driver is hoping to get through the first seven or so cards with as few face cards as possible, quickly ending the game and turning the tables on the dealer. If all the cards in the deck are dealt face down by the dealer the driver must continue to flip the cards until he or she has gone through all the cards, resulting in a total of forty drinks. Here in lies the importance of flipping all the cards successfully as early in the game as possible, for if one gets themselves into a hole early in the game their chances of drinking the entire deck are greatly increased. If the driver can turn over all of the cards on the table before the dealer reaches the end of the deck then it is the dealer who must drink the combined drink value of the remaining face cards and aces in the deck. For instance, if all that remains in the deck is an Ace and a Jack then the combined drink value is five (See Above), so the amount the dealer will drink will vary depending on the amount the driver has already consumed.     After the deck has been exhausted, either by the driver or the dealer drinking whatever they are responsible for, then a new round must be played. In the second round the roles reverse with the driver becoming the dealer and the dealer becoming the driver (fair is fair) unless one of the players involved whimps out, in which case you may taunt and beat them. Play this game for as long as you dare, it tends to have dire consequences (as does the act of drinking and driving).|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I like Trivial Pursuit as a drinking game.

Fish is good for you too but Salmon is a steaky type fish that will satisfy a meat eater.  I buy Fillets instead of cutlets and sprinkle a few chilli flakes on them and cook on the solid plate of the BBQ (delicious) when done put on a plate and loosely cover with foil and allow to rest for a few mins before serving.    I dont know why your giving up eggs as eggs are very good for you.    Salads dont have to be iceburg lettuce, tomato and cucumber.

Place beans, lemon juice, parsley, oil and garlic in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.      Hommus    1 400g can of chickpeas, rinsed and drained (fresh is better if you have the time)  2-3 tablespoons of olive oil (you can adjust this to taste)  Juice of 1/2 a lemon  2 cloves of garlic  2 tablespoons of tahini  large pinch of sea salt  Pepper to taste    combine all ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth.    These recipes take about 10 mins to make,  and will keep for four or five days stored in an airtight container in the fridge (if it lasts that long :)     Hope this helps.

Marc Bittman's How to Cook Everything Vegetarian, and anything by the Moosewood Restaurant are good books.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	I'm sorry I don't have any resources to direct you to - but I have some suggestions if they will help:    - Pick hearty and heavy meals like vegetarian lasagna or pasta with tomato sauce.  Those often have meat in them, and with all those flavors going on you may not miss the meat.    - Try adding TVP to dishes with a lot of sauce.  TVP is textured soy protein and it's pretty cheap especially in bulk.  They have unflavored, chicken flavor and beef flavor.  Use it in place of crumbled ground beef in things like the lasagna or pasta with sauce - the texture is just like ground beef when it is in a heavy sauce.    - Hearty chili with beans and some of that TVP will taste like chili with meat.    I have no miracle replacement for fried or scrambled eggs.  Although I like tofu, I am not one of those people who likes 'mock eggs' made with it.  It is something I just had to learn to avoid.      My absolute favorite breakfast is s whole wheat tortilla, smeared with homemade hummus, two or three tables spoons of pico de gallo and broccoli or other salad sprouts.  Of course it tastes nothing like meat, but it is a great start of the day - or for lunch.  Have several of them, they are great.    Best of luck.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	What are the effects that it is having on you? Are you getting too skinny? People who eat nothing but meat do tend to get very thin and scrawny.    There is no such food or product. Supermarket and Health food stores have shelves packed with the many failed attempts at doing what you want. Nothing but meat protein tastes like meat protein unless they flavour it with extracts of meat protein - even then it is mediocre. If they could discover a way to make a vegetable product the *really* tastes like meat no one would object to vegetarianism.     I eat a lot of fresh vegetables and only small quantities of red meat - lots of seafood though, but I still need that meat protein.  As a result I have tried almost every substitute made - none were even close to the real thing.|`|llkSmgLJaa	A couple cookbooks you may find interesting -  The Meat-Lover's Vegetarian Cookbook - Tanya Petrovna  Becoming Vegetarian: The Complete Guide to Adopting a Healthy Vegetarian Diet - Vesanto Melina & Brenda Davis    BTW: Ovo-vegetarians, like myself, still eat eggs.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Buy fake mince, steak chunks, chicken pieces, sausages etc and make all the same meals you would make now - chillie, bolognaise, curry, stew, shepherds pie, meat pie, pasties, mince and mash.  With sauces nobody can tell the difference.  Many of the fake sausages and burgers are realistic and people can't tell the difference.  You need to experiment to find the realistic ones.  I was 10 when I became vegetarian and my mum just switched all the real meat she bought for fake ones, and everybody ate the same as me.  Nobody minded, because they couldn't tell the difference.|`|8LRxz8tVaa	The absolute best thing I've found so far is Yves veggie ground round. It's pretty much fake ground beef, but its awesome!     You can add it to pasta sauces to make them heartier, and it makes vegetarian chili seem a lot more like regular chili.     The best part, is they have a 'Mexican flavour' version, and you can just mash it up with a 1/2 cup of salsa, and you've got yourself instant vegetarian tacos!|`|KgtlyWDXaa	You don't need to ive up meat entirely, just use less of it.  Chicken and turkey can be lean and very healthy, also fish.  But you can make meals with beef and pork and lamb where the meat just flavors the veggies and grains.    Make a stew from lean round steak that you cut and trim yourself.  One half pound will make four healthy servings once you add your carrots, celery, tomatoes, beans, potatoes etc.    Pork fried rice uses less than 1 cup of diced pork for 4 servings.    Macaroni and cheese, Baked Ziti, Spinach Lasagne, Eggplant Parmasean, Ratatoulle, vegetarian curries, no meat, but hearty satisfying meals.

B6jfvUpgaa	Pros: Its fun, you meet new people, you make some lasting memories (all my best stories start with me at a party), and you just do crazy things you wouldn't normally do. (pretty much all those inhibitions holding you from doing what you want disappear)    Cons: You can get alcohol poisoning and die, if you drive drunk its likely you will crash, you throw up, you wake up with a hangover, and if cops catch you underage then it really sucks.     But if your smart about it and sleep at someones house or walk home, and you make sure you have friends who will stop you from drinking when you've had too many, the main thing you have to worry about is a hangover.

I40vnqNyaa	The simple version is.  Natural means its a natural food like fruit and veg etc something with no additives that has not been man made and or processed.  Something that is grown.    Organic is almost the same.  Its the same product except it has to be grown a certain way.  It has to be certified that no pesticides or unnatural fertilizers have been used and no other crops that used pesticides were grown in the same soil previously.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	organic simply means that all parts are or were at one time a living organism whereas natural can include nonorganic elements such as the ocean itself is just water and it quite natural, but also has organic elements. The weather is natural, but no organic elements make up weather unless you want to counter that trees create oxygen, etc, but weather in itself is not organic. In fact if every living thing on the planet died tomorrow weather would still continue to exist.  The USDA example as above is a perversion of the word organic because science can easily synthesize things from living organisms. The USDA as well as the market manipulates the term organic to make you think just because the label is hung on it then the product you buy must be by all rights be superior if it says "organic" and is therefore more costly.   Many GREAT advances have been made in agriculture from synthesized materials that are perfectly harmless to all organic things of which humans are part of. Yes, you are also organic.|`|JyghcEWpaa	USDAs Agricultural Marketing Service, which oversees the National Organic Program (NOP), published the final rule on national organic standards on Dec. 27, 2000. USDAs Organic Standards asserts that organic and natural are not the same thing. Natural suggests that products have been minimally processed and are free of synthetic ingredients. Products labeled as organic have been certified as meeting USDA organic standards.|`|FxWppY7Baa	organic is regulated in the USA by the USDA organics program (http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop) which requires farmers and processors to keep excellent records, avoid using unapproved substances, be inspected annually and many other hoops to jump through in order to legally use the term organic to market their food.    Natural is totally unregulated and anyone can market anything as natural.

0maJCeLCaa	Host greets guests at the door. Even if you have a butler to actually answer the door, the host has to be in the hall or step into the hall at once to greet the guests.   If necessary, offer them a place to hang/leave coats or have someone take care of the coats.   At a small private function, there may be a few people they don't know. It's the host's job (can le left to someone the guest knows well) to introduce them. At larger functions there will surely be people they don't know - just make sure they meet the ones that are relevant.   Give them a few minutes to meet and greet, before offering them a drink (best to have free hands for meet 'n greet).     Never propose a general toast, without making sure everyone has a drink.
xrRZeROmaa	Yangchow fried rice (6-8 servings) This looks complicated and time consuming, and tastes that way too, but only takes about 15 minutes from start to finish after prep time of 5 to 10 minutes, so long as the rice was cooked the night before.    Preparation of ingredients    4 tablespoons oil for frying    Egg mixture (beat together until slightly foamy)*  4 eggs  1/4 tsp. salt      1/3 cup chopped scallions, in pea-sized pieces, including green part *  6 Chinese dried mushrooms: soak in hot water until spongy, discard stems, cut caps into 1/4" squares. *  6 ounces Smithfield ham or Cantonese barbecued por,k cut into 1/4" cubes *    Shrimp Mixture (mix in a bowl. Refrigerate before use) *    4 ounces fresh shrimp: shell, devein, rinse in running cold water, pat dry, cut into peanut-sized pieces.  1/2 tsp cornstarch  1/2 teaspoon pale dry sherry    1/3 cup fresh or frozen green peas *        Sauce mixture (Mix in a bowl) *    2 tablespoons thin soy sauce  2 tbs. black soy sauce, (substitute 1 tbsp thin soy sauce & 1 tbsp. molasses)  1/4 tsp. salt  1/2 tsp. sugar  1/8 tsp white pepper    4 cups cold cooked long-grain rice; cook a day in advance, and keep chilled in refrigerator (left over steamed rice)  1 teaspoon sesame seed oil    Directions for cooking    1) Heat wok over high heat. Swirl in 2 tablespoons oil for frying. When oil is hot, pour half the egg mixture into wok and swirl it around, spreading it into a thin pancake. Turn pancake when it is set. Remove from pan before it is golden brown. Cook remaining egg mixture in the same manner. Cut pancakes into 1/2" squares. Set aside.    2) Heat wok over high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil for frying. When oil is hot, add scallions, mushrooms, and ham or pork. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds. Add shrimp mixture. Stir-fry until shrimp turns whitish (less than 20 seconds). Add peas. Stir in sauce mixture. mix well. Break up lumps in cooked rice, and add it along with egg squares. Stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until cooked rice is thoroughly hot. Swirl in sesame seed oil, mix well. Put on a serving platter, and serve hot.        Plain rice (makes about 6 cups of rice)    Preparation of ingredients  2 cups long grain rice; wash and rinse in cold water until water is not cloudy, drain  3 cups cold water    Directions for cooking  1) Use a 3 quart pot with a tight lid. Put in the washed rice and add the water. Cook over medium heat without a cover. When it is boiling, you will see that the water is very foamy, almost obscuring the rice. Do not go away! Stand by and watch it closely. You will see the water evaporating to the point where many small holes (like craters) appear in the rice. The Chinese call them rice eyes.    2) Put lid on, turn heat to very low, and cook for 10 minutes. Then turn off heat, but do not remove the pot or uncover it. Let it stay covered for 15 minutes or more. (Do not peek during this 25 minutes! Otherwise the magic steam will escape; you will have half-cooked rice for not having faith!)    3) Remove the cover. Loosen with a fork or chopsticks. Serve hot. (or in this case, reserve 3 cups for the above recipe. Remember the rice must be cold to use in stir-fried rice recipe.)|`|lTkYWiy5aa	FRIED RICE    6 eggs  2/3 c. finely sliced scallions  2 tbsp. light soy sauce  1 tbsp. finely diced ginger  2 tbsp. vegetable oil  2 small red onion, finely diced  4 c. steamed rice  1 tbsp. light soy sauce  1 1/3 c. finely shredded Chinese cabbage leaves    Place eggs in a bowl with onions, soy sauce and ginger and lightly beat with a fork to combine.

This quick and easy recipe explains how to make plain egg fried rice, and goes on to suggest variations.    Instructions    Start by putting 1 tbsp of the oil into a heated wok, followed by the beaten eggs. Cook the egg gently until it has mostly solidified. There is no need to break it up at this point. It is important to keep it on a low-medium heat and not to cook it too long as otherwise the egg will turn out dry and rubbery.   Remove the nearly-cooked egg from the pan. This will be returned to the pan later.   Add the remaining oil to the wok and turn up to medium-high heat.   Add the cold, cooked rice. Start working the rice by breaking it up by pushing the back of spatula onto any lumps. Add a little water if required - this will make the rice more pliable and less separated. Cook for approximately 1 minute.   Once the rice has been heated through and is mostly seperated, add the dark soy sauce and the light soy sauce and season to taste. The dark soy is used for colour, whilst the light soy is used for flavour. Mix the rice well to ensure the soy sauces are well distributed throughout.   [Add extra ingredients here]   Add the pre scrambled egg and break up in the pan using the spatula. Stir frying for an additional 30 seconds.   Finally, add the chopped spring onions, stir briefly and serve.      Notes  We told you it was easy, didn't we?     Now that you have mastered the basic egg fried rice, why not try one of these variations? All you need to do is add these extra ingredients at step 6, ensuring that they are sufficiently heated through before proceeding onto step 7.     These are just suggested recipes, so if you find you want more of one thing, or less of another, it's easy to change!     Chicken Fried Rice  2 medium-sized chicken breast fillets, pre-cooked and diced/roughly shredded  75 g peas  75 g sweetcorn  Garnish with a small drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds  Special Fried Rice   This differs from kitchen to kitchen, but here is our version:     50 g char siu barbecue pork, diced  50 g cooked chicken breast fillet, diced  50 g small prawns, pre-cooked  75 g peas  75 g diced carrot  Your very own "Special Fried Rice"!   We hope that you have been inspired by our fried rice recipes, but remember; most of the time, you do not need a recipe for fried rice - just use up whatever leftovers you have, or any ingredients that you feel like eating.|`|njrKjJVwaa	Chicken Fried Rice      * 4 cups cold cooked rice      * 8 ounces cooked chicken (or substitute cooked turkey, etc.), chopped      * 2 eggs (more if desired)      * 1/2 cup green peas      * 1 medium onion, diced      * 1 green onion, diced      * Seasonings (add according to taste):      * Light Soy Sauce      * Oyster sauce      * Salt      * Pepper      * Oil for stir-frying, as needed   Beat the eggs lightly with chopsticks, add a dash of salt (Add a bit of oyster sauce if desired).    Chop the chicken meat and dice the onion and green onion.    Heat wok and add oil. When oil is ready, pour 1/2 of the egg mixture into the wok and cook over medium heat, turning over once.  Cook the other half the same way.  Cut the egg into thin strips, and save for later.    Stir-fry the onion on high heat for a few moments, remove and set aside. Do the same for the green peas.     Add oil, turn down the heat to medium and stir-fry the rice.  Add the soy sauce, salt, pepper and oyster sauce.  Add the chicken, onion and green peas and combine thoroughly. Serve chicken fried rice with the strips of egg on top and the green onion as a garnish. (Alternately, you can mix the green onion and egg in with the other ingredients).
BWxSSADaaa	Familiar is really in the eye of the beholder.  Most of the non-spice ingredients in Indian food will be familiar to you, it's the spices that you probably find exotic.  However, if you eat a lot of Mexican food, you're probably used to cumin, chili pepper and cilantro.    Here is the absolute simplest Indian recipe I have.  It is for Chana dhal, it is kind of a spicy soup:    Ingredients:    1 large can garbanzo beans   2 small onions or 1 large one  1 t cayenne pepper  1 T chili powder  1 T cumin  2-4 T oil  about 5 cups of water  salt to taste    Method:    Open garbanzo beans, and drain them and rinse them well. Set aside. Sautee chopped onion in about 2 T of the oil. Let them get really nice and brown (but not burned). If you don't let them caramelize, this will have almost no flavor. So be patient. When they're ready, push them to one side of your pot. Pool the oil on the other side by tilting the pot a little. You may need to add a bit more oil if the onions have soaked almost all of it up. Ok, put the pot back on the burner now, and dump your spices into the oil pool (not on the onions). Let them fry for about 30 seconds, and then stir everything in the pot together. Dump the beans into the pot, and stir them well. Let that cook for about a minute, then add the water. Allow it to come to a boil, then simmer for 30 minutes. It can cook longer if you want, but should cook at least 30 minutes for nice soft beans. Add salt to taste. You can also add a bay leaf when you add the water.    Here is another very simple recipe.  It is for curried potatoes:    Red Potatoes    4 -6 BIG potatoes (2-1/2 pounds), boil in the skins, cool, then peel and cut up into cubes 1"-2" big.    In a large pot, heat 1/2 cup oil. When it shimmers, fry 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 - 2 finely chopped serrano peppers, 1/2 Tbsp chili powder, 1/2 Tbsp cumin powder. You can add more cumin powder and chili powder if you want, to your taste. Fry for about 30 seconds, you'll hear the seeds start to pop and you'll smell the spices getting fragrant. Now, add 2 1/2 tsp tomato paste, 1/2 tsp salt, mix in the chopped up potatoes and heat for 2 -3 minutes. Remove from heat. Add a lot of chopped fresh cilantro.    You can serve right away, but it's actually better tasting if you let them sit for about half an hour. They taste great at room temperature.

Here is my version and I also use a wok.    4 Chicken thighs (Brown in the wok in a little vegetable oil.  Coarsely chopped onion  chopped celery  Garlic  one hot chili finely chopped (or 1/4 teaspoon chili flakes)  Add these too your wok or pan and saute.    Add the following:  one heaped teaspoon of curry powder.  one teaspoon of turmeric  1/2 teaspoon all spice  Return chicken to your pan and stir well, you may have to add more of the turmeric or curry powder depends on your taste.    Add from a can of whole tomatoes, two chopped tomato and stir in.  add your vegetables like coarsely chopped carrots, potatoes etc.     Add 1/2 cup of chicken stock to start and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. If you have to add more stock and more coconut milk. Towards the end check for seasoning, you may need to add some sea salt but I doubt it. You won't need to add pepper because of the chili.    Serve over rice. looks difficult but I assure you it is so easy, no stress no mess, and you used only a pan for the curry, and a pot to cook the rice, make sure your rice is not gluey.

I suppose "familiar ingredients" varies from person to person, but here ya go anyway!      JD's Beef Curry (Erachi Varathathu)    ? 1? lbs. boneless, well-marbled chuck steak, cut into 3/4 cubes  ? 4 tsp. ground coriander seeds  ? ? tsp. ground cumin  ? ? tsp. cayenne  ? ? tsp. fennel seeds, ground with a mortar and pestle  ? 1/4 tsp. turmeric  ? 1 1/4 tsp. salt  ? 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil  ? 2 Tbsp. ghee  ? 1 piece cinnamon stick  ? 3 cloves  ? 18 curry leaves  ? 2 medium yellow onions, peeled and thinly sliced  ? 3/4 piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced  ? 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced  ? 2 fresh hot green chiles (serrano or thai), split lengthwise just up to the stem  ? ? tsp. fresh lime juice    1. Put beef, coriander, cumin, cayenne, fennel, turmeric, salt, and 1 cup water in a medium pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until meat is cooked through, 15 minutes. Remove pot from heat, uncover, and set aside.    2. Heat oil and ghee in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add cinnamon and cloves, and fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Carefully add curry leaves (the leaves will spatter when they hit the hot oil), and after they have spattered for a few seconds, add onions, and saut until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add ginger, garlic, and chiles, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are well browned, about 20 minutes longer.    3. Set aside 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid from the meat and an additional 1/4 to make coconut rice, then add meat and remaining liquid from pot to the skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid reduces to a thick sauce that coats the meat and the meat is tender with some chew, 2030 minutes. (Add a little of the reserved cooking liquid if sauce thickens before meat is cooked.) Remove skillet from heat, and add lime juice and a little more salt, if you like.  ----------------------    JD's Coconut Rice  ? Remaining Beef fat from the recipe above to make 2 Tbsp, or ghee, or a mixture of both  ? 1/4 tsp mustard seeds  ? 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes  ? 6 curry leaves  ? 1/2 tsp cumin  ? 2 Tbsp. shredded coconut, fresh or frozen, not dried  ? 1? cups basmati rice  ? kosher salt to taste  ? 1/2 cup green peas  ? 1 can (12  14 oz) coconut milk  ? 1/4 cup reserved beef liquid  ? Enough water to make sure beef liquid and coconut milk equal 3 cups   1. Heat beef fat and/or oil, when hot but not smoking add mustard seeds, red chili flakes and curry leaves. When mustard seeds splutter, add cumin and coconut. Cook, while stirring often to prevent burning, until coconut begins to color.      2. Add rice and stir over the heat until it begins to turn translucent and take on a hint of color.      3. Season with kosher salt to taste, add peas, coconut milk, beef water and water (if using).      4. Bring to a boil, cover, turn to low and cook approximately 20 minutes or until rice grains are tender.|`|tFoFchuEaa	A simple take on Vindaloo with beef:    One beef roast  One white onion  Three cloves of garlic  A can of tomatoes (crushed or whole)  Some cream  A few potatoes  Vindaloo curry paste.    1. Basically you cook it like you would a stew. Cube the beef and sear in some olive oil in a pot.   2. Remove the beef cubes and add diced onion and minced garlic. Saut these until soft and add the beef back to the pot.   3. Toss in the can of tomatoes, and several potatoes (peeled and diced up). The amount of potatoes is up to you, but I prefer just about the same as the amount of beef.  4. Let it simmer for a while like you would a stew. When the potatoes start to become cooked through, add a heaping tablespoon of curry paste, and some cream.  5. Let simmer. If the curry isn't strong enough, add more paste until it's as hot as you like it. If it's too liquidy, tilt the lid of the pot so some steam can escape. If it's still too thin, add a bit more cream.    Serve with white rice, some balkan (sour) yogurt, and naan bread.

One day you maybe cooking for one of those idiots in a restaurant that calls you a ***. I would laugh at them really, most likely they don't know how to do a soft boiled egg, forget about poached, that would really loose them.

I think guys who cook are passionate, open minded, romantic,giving and any girl will be lucky to have such a guy.  I mean no woman wants to be on a date w/ a guy(at his place) who will always order in a pizza just because he's lost in the kitchen or is lazy and/or doesn't know how to work a blender to make a nice delicious shake for his lady.|`|DgCsBWk9aa	Well im pretty puzzled myself.

So you might cop it now but it is an essential life skill so I wouldn't worry what your 15 year old friends think.|`|AA10672842	Some of the best chefs in the world are men. You friends at school are probably going to rely on take out when they get older.You , on the other hand ,will be able to cook a fine meal  for yourself. Do not let these insecure guys make you feel bad. Never be afraid to try new things and acquire new skills.Your friends are antiquated in their thinking .Have they missed the fact that there is gender equality and that men and women are capable of doing the same things.Cooking is a  life skill everyone should have.|`|dINfAO02aa	I also love to cook, whenever they tell you that, tell them to turn on the T.V. Ever watched the food network? More than half the people on there are men!  Tell those guys that you are more of a man because you don't need Mommy to make you lunch anymore. Tell um that when ever they are hungry and shove food in their mouth, someone has made it. How about cake? Everybody loves it, but think of yourself as cool because you don't have depend on someone else to make it. By cooking you are more independent. Cooking is a valuable life skill and is good with ladies. Girls don't always want to have to cook stuff on there own. It is nice to be pampered once in awhile, plus hang on to a girl by louring her in with that perfect chocolate souffle recipe! Why wouldn't people love a guy who can cook?

The pit is shaped similar to an obelisk, so you'll end up with 2 large pieces and 2 smaller pieces from each mango. Roughly chop the flesh.    In a saute pan heat the oil and add the chile flakes. Be careful not to burn the chile, just toast to flavor the oil. Add the onions and sweat until soft. Add the ginger and bell pepper and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Finally add the mango and cook for 1 more minute.    In a separate bowl, combine the pineapple juice, vinegar, sugar, and curry powder. Add this mixture to the pan. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a bare simmer and reduce for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Add the raisins and the nuts and transfer to another container over an ice bath. I used a mild yellow curry powder, but if you want it hotter go for red.    Serve over a grilled fish fillet.|`|2b17c80ce64ad216b8306152f28b338aaa	u can make like a fruit salad....|`|sowuYptiaa	Toast up some garbanzo beans in a tiny bit of oil and flavor them with whatever you like---garlic, cumin, chili powder, just salt and pepper, anything!

TxcpzRdRaa	I am kind of confused as to what you mean by choosing a dinner over a hall. If permitted to decorate, an easy way to do the theme would be to paint a banner with the lyrics to hang around the top of the room. You'd have to have pretty handwriting though! Or take the line you like most and print it on the invitations. (Not sure how far away it is.)  It's a very pretty song. =) I'm sorry, it's a bit difficult to do. Even if you had a DJ, you could only play the song so many times...sorry!

Other than shrimp cocktail with my friend's homemade super-horseradishy sauce, this is my absolute all time favorite way to eat shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail.  It's a Cuban dish called Enchilado.  You can make it with just shrimp, or add other shellfish to your liking.  My favorite combination is shrimp and king crab legs.    I'm too tired to try and remember how we make it, but this recipe comes very close.  Again, use whatever shellfish you like.  We use red wine instead of sherry, but other than that, this is pretty authentic.     Lobster and Stone Crab Enchilado (A Cuban Recipe)        *  2 uncooked frozen lobster tails (1 1/2 pounds total), thawed, cut in half lengthwise, each half cut into thirds with shell intact      * 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice          * 1/4 cup olive oil      * 1/3 cup chopped onion      * 2 tablespoons chopped green bell pepper      * 2 garlic cloves, chopped      * 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley      * 1/4 teaspoon paprika      * 2 large plum tomatoes, seeded, diced      * 1/2 cup canned tomato pure      * 3/4 cup bottled clam juice      * 1/2 cup dry Sherry wine      * 1 bay leaf      * 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper      * 1 pound stone crab claws, cracked     Place thawed lobster and fresh lime juice in medium bowl; toss to coat. Let stand 15 minutes, tossing lobster occasionally.    Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over high heat. Add lobster pieces and any accumulated juices. Saut until lobster shells turn bright orange, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, return lobster to same bowl. Reduce heat to medium. Add chopped onion and chopped bell pepper to pot; saut until soft, about 5 minutes. Add chopped garlic cloves, fresh parsley, and paprika and saut 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes and tomato pure. Cook until juices thicken, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Add clam juice, dry Sherry, and bay leaf. Season to taste with salt. Add cayenne pepper. Bring mixture to boil, then add stone crab claws and reserved lobster with any accumulated juices. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lobster meat is cooked through and tender, about 10 minutes.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	I have a saying about shrimp and that is "Shrimp....ANY WAY, ANY DAY!"

AA12031316	Well, its a tough call, but only YOU can make that decision.  If you know you can get along perfectly fine on a vegetarian diet, then why would you want to fill your body with dead critters?  If you truly love animals, don't eat them.  You wouldn't eat a cat, dog, or parrot would you?  So why a cow, pig or chicken?  There are plenty of wonderful non meat options out there.  If you choose to eat meat again, then tell yourself whatever you need to make that okay, but there is little point in eating something that makes you feel guilty.  If you feel guilty about it, then you know it is wrong for you.  (don't get worked up, omnivores, I am just saying for HER, it feels wrong)  You should eat foods that nourish you mentally, physically, and spiritually.  If you feel guilt about any food, then you instinctively know its not right.|`|PxjbCMl0aa	You're the only one that can make that choice.  If you feel guilty, you either a) don't do it again or b) get over the guilt.  You're only a hypocrite if you look down on people that eat chicken and talk about how wrong it is and how much you love animals and then go get a bucket from KFC.  You slipped up, it happens.  But to answer your question...i've found it's always best to follow your heart.  You're much happier that way!|`|2scuBnf3aa	You're not a hypocrite, and you should never be ashamed of eating meat. It's perfectly natural and can really help you get the protein you need! You can absolutely still love animals AND eat meat! Trust me, I do!     Don't let other vegetarians bully you into feeling bad about yourself. You didn't do anything wrong.|`|GyDU6g5Kaa	Hm...I'm a pescatarian (only eats fish) and it's great! I don't think that eating the chicken was right if you were a vegetarian. Chicken is THE WORST thing for you : http://www.goveg.com/factoryFarming_chic...  Read about it. It's truly sickening. I hope this helps!|`|M8dmeAv6aa	I suppose that chicken you ate yesterday wasn't so lucky. Maybe she didn't feel loved. When you have been a vegetarian for a long time the taste of that chicken will be horrible. You will then make sure you don't put any more in your mouth.|`|AA12239026	Only YOU know why you made the choice that you made.  It also is only YOU that can make the choice in this situation.    Others can give their views - their opinions - but bottom line is that you are the one that has to live it and only you know what you will and will not be able to live with.|`|IegOHQXOaa	I don't know what's right for you; and no one can condemn you for making a choice that is right for your lifestyle. Lacto-ovo, pescatarian, vegan? It's all up to the one person you'll be feeding- you. The only way you can answer this question is spending some quiet time alone thinking about why you became a vegetarian in the first place. One thing that really helps me when I'm stuck is making a list. List why you are a vegetarian then list the pros and cons of your diet according to YOU, don't go near a computer this is your decision.   Remember that there are all kinds of vegetarian diets that can work for everyone.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Are you a hypocrite? Yes, but what is done is done. Everybody makes mistakes. The important thing is that you learn from them. What have you learned about yourself? What have you learned about your vegetarianism? Instead of beating yourself up, use that energy for some much-needed introspection. Only you can make decisions about your diet.|`|9ilXVowLaa	you're not a hypocrite!  you may not have been getting enough protein in your diet.  don't feel badly-you can love animals and still eat meat.  maybe look for free range chicken?  or try a faux meat like Morning Star or Veggie Patch.|`|iXx9SWceaa	If you're a vegetarian, then why would you eat a piece of chicken? My advice to you is, go out to your local supermarket and get some soy chicken. Cook it up, and eat it while playing with your household pets. If you do not have any pets, go over to friends house or something. Remind yourself of why you became a vegetarian, because you love animals.    [add] Also, you don't need meat to get protein, just so you know. Plant proteins alone can provide enough of the essential and non-essential amino acids, as long as sources of dietary protein are varied and caloric intake is high enough to meet energy needs. Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, seeds and nuts all contain both essential and non-essential amino acids. You don't need to consciously combine these foods ("complementary proteins") within a given meal, either.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Your local grocer isn't going to stop selling meat because of you.  You needed the protein as you probably haven't been eating enough of it over the last year.  I went thru the same thing many years ago.    Love animals all you want.  That's not a bad thing.  Humans need protein to live.  Some veg heads think that fish is ok to eat.  I disagree as fish are alive as well as chickens and cows.  But then, I like to catch my own fish.|`|kAfZaLwraa	You're only a hypocrite if you're telling other people that they shouldn't eat chicken. You slipped up is all. If you want to stay veg, stay veg. If not, don't. But if you love animals, consider (very seriously) taking the time to find pasture-raised sources of meat.

You can find books on specific types of cusine in just about any library or book store - for meats, for fish, veggies, salads, etc.  You can find ethnic cookbooks, too... Italian, "Soul Food", Tex-Mex, French, etc.    The specific books will usually open with the methods for cooking that are unique to that particular style, as well as some that are common to general styles, for comparison.    Stop at any garage sales that you see - you might be able to find some there.  Again, the library and just about any bookstore will have "some" books... and the internet has more information about How To... do just about anything that you can imagine!    Good luck!|`|AA10928232	I like the good ol' Betty Crocker cookbook, in the 3-ring binder.

ba9879373d57de46330b2c7ad9b722b2aa	You can call it 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,... OR 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, but what we are really talking about is CAFFEINE. Caffeine may be the most popular drug in the world. We consume caffeine in coffee, tea, cocoa, chocolate, some soft drinks, and some drugs. The actual source of caffeine is the coffee bean, tea leaf, kola nut and cacao pod. Pure caffeine is odorless and has a bitter taste.Effects of Caffeine on the Nervous System  Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. In moderate doses, caffeine can:  increase alertness   reduce fine motor coordination   cause insomnia   cause headaches, nervousness and dizziness  In massive doses, caffeine is lethal. A fatal dose of caffeine has been calculated to be more than 10 grams (about 170 mg/kg body weight) - this is the same as drinking 80 to 100 cups of coffee in rapid succession - not an easy thing to do.    Caffeine enters the bloodstream through the stomach and small intestine and can have its effects as soon as 15 minutes after it is consumed. Once in the body, caffeine will stay around for hours: it takes about 6 hours for one half of the caffeine to be eliminated.    Caffeine belongs to the xanthine chemical group. Adenosine is a naturally occurring xanthine in the brain that is used as a neurotransmitter at some synapses. One effect of caffeine is to interfere with adenosine at multiple sites in the brain including the reticular formation. Caffeine also acts at other sites in the body to increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels, relax air passages to improve breathing and allow some muscles to contract more easily.     Some studies show that caffeine causes physical dependence. One way to tell if someone "needs" that cup of coffee or bottle of Coke is to take it away from them and then see if they have any withdrawal symptoms. Typical withdrawal symptoms associated with caffeine are headache, fatigue and muscle pain. These symptoms can occur within 24 hours after the last dose of caffeine. One study has stated that the minimum consumption of caffeine for physical dependence is 4 cups of coffee per day. Other studies say that a few more cups of coffee are needed to develop dependence|`|7h0qfos1aa	My boyfriend drinks 2-3 cups of coffee a day and NEVER gets a full night's sleep. The smallest noise or shuffle will wake him up, and he has to have the room be completley dark or he can't fall asleep at all! It is how he has reacted to the caffeine because 5-6 years ago he was not like that at all.     Caffeine also stunts your growth and can cause heavy mental crashes and exhaustion when it wears off.     On the plus side, a cup of coffee in the morning can really perk you up and tastes / smells absolutely wonderful.|`|CNSGz12zaa	I am not sure about his disease but they just said on the news that 5 cups a day were showing significant improvement for Alzheimer's.

I own 4 ice cream machines.   Two Donvier (1 quart and 1 pint) that work via frozen insert.   1 Electric that works via ice and rock salt and 1 Cuisinart self contained freezing unit.    The Cuisinart is is a work of art.    1 hour from unmixed ingredients to eating ice cream.     The others work just as well but require more work, time and planning (having rock salt on hand or remembering to freeze the inserts the night before).   You can make ice cream without a machine but it will be infinitely better if you use one.    You can get an inexpensive one for around $30.   This one is a great bargain for 30 and includes free shipping.    http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-683...    There are two different kinds of ice cream.    Custard based and Cream based.   The main difference is that the custard based contains egg yolks (typically lots of egg yolks).    I have made both types many times and can share this observation.    The best creamiest ice cream you can make is custard based.    It requires a bit more work but if you are seeking the ultimate ice cream, go with a recipe that contains eggs.     The recipes themselves are fairly simple and there are thousands of them on the internet.    I recommend foodtv.   I have made several of their recipes and all come out good.       Here is a good vanilla ice cream recipe    http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton...    Good luck|`|9Vjjr0M7aa	ice, milk, sugar and blend it, then freeze it.|`|xyE4lVcEaa	This link has everything you need: http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/20...    This is basically what it says:    Making Ice Cream Without A Machine      1. Prepare your ice cream mixture(find a recipe for an ice cream that you'd like), then chill it over an ice bath.    2. Put a deep baking dish, or bowl made of plastic, stainless steel or something durable in the freezer, and pour your custard mixture into it.     3. After forty-five minutes, open the door and check it.     As it starts to freeze near the edges, remove it from the freezer and stir it vigorously with a spatula or whisk. Really beat it up and break up any frozen sections. Return to freezer.    4. Continue to check the mixture every 30 minutes, stirring vigorously as it's freezing. If you have one, you can use a hand-held mixer for best results, or use a stick-blender or hand-held mixer.    But since we're going low-tech here, you can also use just a spatula or a sturdy whisk along with some modest physical effort.    5. Keep checking periodically and stirring while it freezes (by hand or with the electric mixer) until the ice cream is frozen. It will likely take 2-3 hours to be ready.     Transfer the ice cream to a covered storage container until ready to serve.

But for taste, definitely the Mango.|`|cjpH8RWTaa	Mango's, I hate the mushiness of banana's|`|ephZkM4oaa	Bananas are the best. Because of their impressive potassium content, bananas are highly recommended by doctors for patients whose potassium is low. One large banana, about 9 inches in length, packs 602 mg of potassium and only carries 140 calories. That same large banana even has 2 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber. No wonder the banana was considered an important food to boost the health of malnourished children    Those reducing sodium in their diets can't go wrong with a banana with its mere 2 mgs of sodium. For the carbohydrate counters there are 36 grams of carbohydrates in a large banana.    The other banana nutrition facts are also quite impressive. Vitamins and minerals are abundant in the banana, offering 123 I.U. of vitamin A for the large size. Banana also has a full range of B vitamins with .07 mg of Thiamine, .15 mg of Riboflavin, .82 mg Niacin, .88 mg vitamin B6, and 29 mcg of Folic Acid. There is even 13.8 mg of vitamin C. On the mineral scale Calcium counts in at 9.2 mg, Magnesium 44.1 mg, with trace amounts of iron and zinc.    Putting all of the nutritional figures together clearly shows the banana is among the healthiest of fruits. The plantain, when cooked, rates slightly higher on the nutritional scale in vitamins and minerals but similar to the banana in protein and fiber content.|`|2QWH2Hv6aa	mango|`|lY82TsNBaa	bananaaaaaaa|`|Ixb3nCIDaa	Both are pretty yummy fruits, I love mango but Banana is pretty good, and packed with nutrients.Plus Bananas is great with cereal, pancakes in smoothies and not too messy to eat which can happen with mango sometimes.|`|AA11402528	bananas    mangos are gross|`|Ni4WqdIYaa	i would definetly go with mango because it taste super good and a very rich juicy flavor|`|lM7xPQg0aa	banana

AA12357988	Why the hell would you boil a chicken breast?  That doesn't sound particularly appetizing.  Just cook it until it's no longer pink.      If you want to make wings, there's no such thing as "Buffalo chicken wing chicken".  They're just called chicken wings.  And they should be in the meat department of just about every single grocery store imaginable.  You can also use drumsticks.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	I  always  put  the  chicken  in  a  saucepan,  add  enough  water  to  cover  it  good  and  bring  it  to  a  boil.  As  soon  as  it  comes  to  a  boil,  I  turn  down  the  heat  to  low  and  simmer  gently  for  about  5  minutes.  Turn  off  the  heat  and  let  the  chicken  sit  in  the  hot  water  for  about  35 - 45  minutes.  Then  drain  and  the  meat  is  ready  for  whatever...  sandwiches,  casserole,  whatever.    Yeah,  you  can  buy  a  package  of  chicken  wings  in  the  meat  market  section  of   supermarket.  They  are  very  easy  to  cook  or  roast  (my  preference).

You can buy a "party pack" of chicken wings fresh in the deli, or a bag of frozen wings in the freezer department. Chicken wings are so easy to make. Deep fry them and toss them in some Frank's Hot Sauce and melted butter....or go the healthy route....steam them to get rid of the excess fat, and then roast them in the oven until crispy, then toss in the sauce.
yPTUG6uNaa	Soy is unlikely to be the cause of your breast enlargement or tumor development. In regard to the former, although soy does contain phytoestrogens (technically called isoflavones) evidence indicates the soybean phytoestrogens dont substantially affect hormone levels in either men or women. Further, there is little evidence that the adult exposure to phytoestrogens cause changes in the breast (based on mammograms and breast biopsies) although the changes studied thus far relate primarily to cancer risk, not size.    In regard to breast cancer, epidemiologic data suggest that higher soy intake reduces risk of developing this disease. That is, Asian women who consume higher amounts of soy are less likely to develop breast cancer than those who consume lower amounts. However, it is not clear if the observed protective effects stems from consumption during adulthood or during childhood/adolescence. Most evidence suggests it is the latter.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	I grew up consuming a lot of soya and am flat chested.  There are hormones in soya milk but there are hormones in dairy milk and they are far more powerful.  Eating a lot of dairy when you're growing up will give you a bigger chest than you would have had without it.  Neither should affect your chest size once you're adult, unless you consume so much you put on weight/fat.  Your breasts may increase in fat but not in breast-tissue.  The same would happen if you put on weight by eating too much of any food.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	Uhm. they don't put hormones in soy milk.    they used to and in some milks still do, put it in cows milk. thats why a lot of the labels now say 'with no artificial growth hormones"    soy milk is made from soy beans. soy beans don't have hormones that farmers can alter.    ** edit: it does contain plant estrogens. they aren't added in and according to the website below it states: "Eat foods that contain plant estrogens, especially tofu and other soy products."    so they are good for something, and its massive amounts.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Who ever told you that is pulling your chain.  Soy is protein, but does have hormones, but not like birth control pills.  It's a very small amount.    Boobs come from fat and glands.

I haven't tried it, but it sounds good.     The Ultimate Veggie Burger  (Source: http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001...    Ingredients:  2 1/2 cups sprouted garbanzo beans (chickpeas) OR canned garbanzos, drained and rinsed  4 large eggs  1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt  1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro  1 onion, chopped  Grated zest of one large lemon  1 cup micro sprouts, chopped (try brocolli, onion, or alfalfa sprouts - optional)  1 cup toasted (whole-grain) bread crumbs  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter)    Directions:  If you are using sprouted garbanzos, steam them until just tender, about 10 minutes. Most of you will be using canned beans, so jump right in and combine the garbanzos, eggs, and salt in a food processor. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a very thick, slightly chunky hummus. Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the cilantro, onion, zest, and sprouts. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1 1/2-inch-thick patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter.  Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately.  Makes 12 mini burgers.      This site has a ton of vegetarian recipes.

You have to boil them in salt for about 5-7 mins. Drain the water and squeeze the granules.     For the burger recipes:  1) Use 1/4th of that soya granules box, a potato, a tsp of white or corn flour and your own spices (paprika, basil, pepper,cayenne pepper and some cumin powder or use a mexican blend with some fresh tomatoes, onions, clantro leaves---use your imagination) with salt and oil---kneed all of them together and make them into patties. Brush a baking pan with some oil or cooking spray and bake it at 400F for about 10 mins. You can grill them as well. Or can shallow pan fry them.    2) You can use black bean, sweet potatoes, some grilled mushroom slices and use your own spices (goes well with some onions, lemon juice, cayenne pepper) and follow the same method as in (1)    3) You can use tofu, a potato (or not--can use some white flour to hold the ingredients together), boiled mixed veggies (carrots, beats, green beans, peas)--squeeze out the water properly ; otherwise it will be soggy and follow the same steps.

I suspect that you have no idea what those terms mean either.....    The cost of coke varies depending on what city you live in but in general:    Coke is $25 for .25 grams.    $50 for a half gram.     A gram, as you may guess, costs $100.    1/8 ounce (3.5 grams) is called an "eight ball" and that costs up to $300 but you should be able to talk them down to $120 to $180    if you are actually gonna buy coke and know so little about drugs I suggest you get ready to get beat up.
5zNwBQZHaa	6 donuts FOR 6 days means 36 donuts total    If you had asked 6 donuts IN 6 days, that would mean 6 donuts total.    Calorie wise - eating one donut a day for six days has the same effect as 1 donut on each of six days - after a week, it is all the same.    But you would have a better chance of burning the donuts off if eaten just one a day (all other things being equal and you don't eat like a pig) than if you ate all six in one day.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	no literally ----------------------------------------... are stretched over a week vs. 6 in one day,|`|ILpp3ncYaa	It all depends, it is better to take them in gradually if you fit them in to your daily caloric regimen, if you eat them all at once and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner then you will gain weight that could have been avoided.

5zNwBQZHaa	The ingredients needed to make alcohol (grain, sugars) are going to cost you way more than just going to Wal-Mart and buying their brand of distilled white vinegar at $1.47 per half gallon.    There is a way to make vinegar using apple cider- you don't need to make alcohol first - All you have to do is add already-made vinegar to apple cider, in a proportion of 1:4.    But I don' t know of a source where you could buy apple cider any cheaper than you can vinegar in large containers already made.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	You can buy cheap vinegar by the gallon at Wal Mart. That's easy to do...    Here's a link about vinegar:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar|`|AA10928232	Just buy the gallon of white vinegar on the cleaning aisle at a grocery store (maybe on vinegar aisle, too).  Pure vinegar is hugely acidic, and what we eat and clean with is only about a 4% concentration.  100% would probably erode your sinuses and eat your skin!|`|x2cXYousaa	A container with a spout .(e.g. a sun tea jar) The spout is not mandatory but it sure makes things easier. The container should also have a wide mouth to let in air as well as a way to keep out flies. (Air is very important!) You will be visited by vinegar flies!  They are my assistants. The container should be glass or stainless steel for best results. Aluminum and iron is definately out.  Some plastics can work, some are dangerous because they react with vinegar. So, for now, I would skip plastics.     Some fresh fruit juice. (Even the frozen variey will do. But I would stay away from the bottled ones because they add chemicals to keep the juice from turning to vinegar. (See how easy it is to make vinegar.)     A starter culture. Notice I said "starter culture".  Don't make a big deal about getting a "mother", it will probably ruin otherwise good vinegar. What you need are the bacteria which make vinegar.  Check the home brew stores or pick up a bottle of unpasturized, unfiltered vinegar.  I have had great success with Braggs Apple cider vinegar. The vinegar in the culture keeps out the other molds and bacteria until the vinegar bacteria have had a chance to take firm control of the juice.     A dark place.  You could also paint your jar or cover it . The object is to keep out the light. Light will slow the vinegar production or even kill your culture.     A warm place. The precise temperature is not so critical but it does make a difference on how fast your vinegar is made. If you feel comfortable at that temperature, most likely the vinegar bacteria will be happy also.     OK, we have a vinegar culture, a container to put it in, some food for it and lot's of warm air available to it.    Pour about one quart of the starter into the container.     Pour about the same amount of juice into the container.     Put the mix into a warm dark place.     Keep checking it until it is as strong as you like it or it seems to be losing strength.     Bottle it in small bottles.     Leave it for at least six months before using.  (You could use it right away but, this will make it smoother)     Once you have got the hang of it, you might want to try making some real special vinegar.    have a nice day!!    mar

F3LBgfvwaa	In theory I suppose we would finish them off (eat them) and not make them reproduce anymore and their wild ancestors would continue to live in the wild. Very simple. Good luck with your vegetarianism.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Chickens and Cows would still be kept for eggs and milk, sheep would be kept for wool, and pigs would be kept for pets - they're more intelligent than dogs.  If we werent eating them, not as many would be born, but better to not be born then live horrific lives in factory farms and be murdered in a slaughterhouse.  They would never go extinct.  If they became so rare that they were in danger of extinction then everyone would want one as a pet.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	If we all quit eating dairy animals, the population would bloom to such large herds of cattle that we would be hitting them with our cars.    Hunting and culling of deer in the northern part of the states is normal to keep the population down.  I've come close many times to hitting deer in the road as they search for food.    Can you just imagine driving down the road one foggy night and hitting a huge pig?  Pigs go wild really fast.  Take a look at Hawaii and what happened to them!    Go veg if you feel the need, but there will still be meat in your grocery store.  You're not saving animals.      By the way, make sure you eat enough protein so you don't get sick like I did.|`|AA12031316	Good question, but it can be looked at from the other side as well.  Animals raised for human consumption only BECAME domesticated through human intervention. Considering that many animals raised for food, especially cows, are grass eating, vegetarian creatures themselves, then yes, I think they would survive grazing in the wild.  They have been domesticated to eat a totally unnatural diet high in grains, ground animal parts, and other things that are not their intended diet.  Turkey feathers are ground in to many animal feeds.  Even farmed fish are fed ridiculous things, such as wheat, soy and corn.  Where in the wild would fish get those things?  They are meant to eat algae, and other marine life, but have been domesticated to eat things that would feed humans and put an end to world hunger if so many of the resources were not going in to animal feed.  Also, if animals were in the wild, then nature would take its course in the long run, and the population would control itself through natural breeding.  In factory farms, animals are artificially inseminated many more times than they would breed naturally in the wild, and given growth hormones and steroids to make them grow faster.  If left to their own resources, there would not be so many of them once it balanced itself out.   Sadly, there is little chance that even 1/3 of the population will ever become vegetarian, since the meat industry and government have done such a great job at brainwashing people into thinking they need meat to survive.  We simply do not.  If humans were intended to eat meat, we would be equipped with the speed, agility and strength to hunt, capture, kill and consume animals without the need for tools.  We are the only species that cooks our food, since we cannot digest raw meat.  We have 4 tiny incisor teeth, and the rest of our teeth are flat like other vegetarian creatures.  With our imposable thumbs and slow gait, we are better suited for gathering fruits and berries.  Again, there is no hope of convincing anyone of any of this, so the meat industry will simply keep on mass producing unhealthy cattle, keeping them alive just long enough to get them through the slaughterhouse door and onto the plates of people who give little thought to where their meat comes from.|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	I think that the human mind is amazing. If you become vegetarian or vegan and other people do too what are you talking about? 10% of the population? And even if that percentage grows -- I wouldn't worry about the animal population. Corporate agribusiness is a business and you can believe that they would simply step down production or export their product, When people do not see the animals as animals but as $$$$ they are not going out of business. So the best any of us can do is simply follow our conscience and remember the story of the person on the beach who was found throwing a starfish back into the sea; and when he was asked why he was doing it when there were hundreds of others of them on the beach  -- his response was simple. He said "it matters to that one."  And frankly it does matter. It matters to every animal we don't eat, and to the planet that isn't being polluted with methane sinks etc. And it definitely matters to our own bodies, health and spirituality. I hope that helps.|`|7ad7b6a92f7e7ce5b8737b84ca7924ecaa	Many varieties of sheep go extinct every year simply because the market wants specific types (ones who produce meat quickly or ones who grow the right type of wool etc). The same is true for chickens and I'm sure for other domestic animals too. Possibly domestic animals would have done better (less numbers but more variety better suited to each individual place) if humans hadn't started mass producing them. However it is true that is people didn't start eat/wear/have a use for a lot of these animals then they might not be around today at all...just like the rest of the animals in the world which go extinct every single day. I doubt it though, because there used to be many wild type of cows, pigs, chickens, sheep etc so they would probably still be around, just not as we know them now.)        So I'm not sure what would happen to them if the whole world went vegetarian right now. Chickens would probably be ok, they make great pets and produce eggs. A lot of people also keep cows, pigs and sheep as pets too.    But really you don't need to worry about it at all... there is no way the whole world would go vegetarian (no matter how hard we try :P) and even if they did it would be a gradual process. Going vegetarian is the best thing you can do for these animals... good luck!|`|M8dmeAv6aa	I've been a vegetarian for a very long time. I can't imagine everyone in anyplace but maybe India becoming vegetarian. The pigs would become wild with a month or two. There's already a problem with many of them already being feral and eating up farmer's produce. I think the sheep would get eaten by coyotes right away if humans didn't protect them. The cattle can also become wild and roam around in herds. There was once great herds of cattle and horses in US after the buffalo were slaughtered and before many replacement people moved in. The history on this is sad. Old maps identify places as having great herds of cattle and horses.  If humans only consumed grains,vegetables,nuts and fruits the demand for agriculture land and water would be greatly decreased. This would mean an increase in wild animal populations.|`|5zyMFk6Taa	I am 100% certain that all of them would die at some point in the future.|`|PxjbCMl0aa	Realistically, that would never happen, and if it did, it would be over many, many years.  The way I think about it...better to be extinct rather than having to suffer in slaughter houses.  It's kinds of the same with dogs and cats...spay and neuter, spay and neuter, it's all you hear anymore.  What if everyone spayed and neutered their animals?  Then there would be no more baby animals.  I don't even know how I got onto this subject but apparently, tonight in my mind they are related somehow.|`|7pgwWoUlaa	If wanna know about Nutritional Benefit.  that is here.........  http://here-under.blogspot.com/2009/01/n...|`|wX1xcnZOaa	In today's conditions, those livestock not existing is better than them being treated the way they are.

1e5bdac35c1fb1a219cde220695b151eaa	This is a fairly quick and easy recipe for empanadas. A friend recently gave it to me, and my whole family loved them!!! Just about any kind of fruit, including melon, is fine. Or make the meat filling by using your favorite type of meat. Make one of the fillings or double the dough and make both!"   Original recipe yield: 10 empanadas.  Prep Time:30 MinutesCook Time:30 MinutesReady In:1 Hour 30 MinutesServings:10 (change)     --------------------------------------...    INGREDIENTS:  2 cups all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon salt   2/3 cup shortening   6 tablespoons water   2 1/2 cups peeled, cored and sliced apples   1 cup white sugar   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg   1 yellow onion   1 green bell pepper   1 tablespoon olive oil   8 ounces tomato paste   1/2 cup water   1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar   1 pound lean steak, cut into 1 inch cubes     --------------------------------------...    DIRECTIONS:  To make dough: In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in the shortening till pieces are the size of small peas. Add a small amount of water to slightly moisten. Form dough into a ball. Roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 4-inch circles. Lightly flour both sides of circles.   To make fruit filling: In a saucepan combine fruit, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Heat over medium heat until hot, thoroughly mixing.   To make meat filling: In a medium skillet saute the onion and green pepper in olive oil. Add tomato paste, water, and vinegar, and cook for 20 minutes. Add meat and coat thoroughly with the sauce.   Place a large spoonful of one of the above mixtures to the center of a dough circle. Place another circle on top. Fasten the two circles together by pressing the edges with a fork. These may then be baked in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden brown.     or    EMPANADAS:   5 cups flour (unsifted)   1 tablespoon baking powder   2 teaspoons salt   1 cup shortening (Crisco preferred)   1 cup milk   Mix flour, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl.   Cut in shortening until it resembles crumbly meal.  Gradually sprinkle in milk stirring until dough clings together.  Knead 10 times.  Let rest 1/2 hour.   Filling:     2 lbs. ground beef   1/2 teaspoon salt   1 tablespoon onion powder   1 teaspoon garlic powder   1 teaspoon chili powder   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce   1 to 2 tablespoons tomato paste   hot sauce (optional)   Mix ground beef with all the ingredients except tomato paste.  Fry slowly in 1 tablespoon oil until cooked.  Mash around a bit so it's crumbly.  Add 1 to 2 tablespoons tomato paste (so that it's thick), stir very well.  Turn off heat and let filling cool.  Add as much hot sauce as you like.  On a very well-floured surface, roll dough as thick as you would for pie crust (can divide it into 2 parts if desired).  Cut 5"circles (using any container with 5" opening) and place filling on center of each circle.  Brush beaten egg on lower edge of circles. Fold over and press edges with fork dipped in flour.  Fry in lard about 2 minutes on each side until brown.  Make sure there is enough lard to cover the empanadas--- about 3 - 4" deep.   *Can be frozen unfried.  Stack between wax paper, sprinkling plenty of flour in between empanadas and wax paper, or they will stick together.        or    Ingredients: (Makes about 20 empanadas)    Meat filling: (Must be made long enough before hand to allow to fully cool. It's best if it's made a day before and refrigerated overnight.)  5 lbs of lean ground beef  2 yellow onions, chopped  1 clove of garlic, peeled and mashed  1 teaspoon of cumin  3 tablespoon of Adobo seasoning  Adobo seasoning a mixture of salt, granulated garlic, oregano, black pepper, tumeric and others depending on the brand or recipe. You can buy Adobo seasoning in most supermarkets, in the ethnic foods or powdered seasonings sections. Goya is probably the most popular brand. If you can't find it in the store, try Googling for a recipe to make your own.    Mix all ingredients and cook the meat mixture in a stew pot until cooked medium to medium-rare (it will finish cooking inside the empanada.)    Other things you will need for the filling:  5 eggs, hard boiled  Can of ripe olives (save some of the juice for Dough making process.)  Box of Raisins    Dough: (Many different fillings can be used, so the dough is the most important part.)  5 lbs of unbleached flour  1 cup of vegetable shortening or lard (do not use oil)  6-8 cups of chicken broth.    to mke the dough        Empanada Dough Instructions:  Pour all of the flour into a big mound on a large counter-top or other surface sufficient for working.  Hollow out a "crater" in the top of the mound.    Pour about 1/4 of the chicken broth into the "crater".  Mix the broth into the flour.    Continue pouring and mixing the broth little by little until all of the broth is mixed in.  Melt the shortening in a small sauce pan.    Once all the shortening is melted, pour it into the flour, mixing at the same time.  (Be careful not to burn yourself on the hot melted shortening, the owner of this site does not assume liability for any injuries during this or any other process.)    Kneed the dough thoroughly.    Roll the dough into a large log shape.  Break the "log" into two equal pieces and continue kneading.    Once the dough is well mixed, break off pieces into tennis ball sized pieces.    Take one of the tennis ball sized pieced and roll it flat with a rolling pin.  Then place a couple of table-spoons of the meat mixture, one slice of ha|`|AA11686559	http://www.recipezaar.com/r/q=empanadas|`|1b824e1472fdb3e4bba1df46689232a5aa	Are'nt you Spanish?|`|AA11279569	Google it!

AA10332096	Here is a waffle cone recipe (my favorite).  You didn't specify which kind.  If this is not what you want if you add to your question telling me I'll try to do a better job of answering...here goes!  This recipe makes about 20 cones.      3 eggs    3/4 cup sugar    1/2 cup butter, melted    2 tsp vanilla    1 1/2 cups flour    2 tsp baking powder          Beat the eggs and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is creamy.     Stir in the melted butter and vanilla.     Combine the flour and baking powder, and then add it to the mixture. Blend it in well.     Drop about 4 tsp (20 ml) of the batter into a heated pizelle iron, and cook both sides over medium-high heat for about 1 minute each, or until golden brown.     Remove the waffle from the pizelle iron and immediately shape it into a cone while it is still pliable.   A pizelle iron looks like a round waffle iron. There are ``manual'' irons, and electric ones too. If you don't have a pizelle iron, another idea is to use an ordinary waffle iron and have ice-cream on top of the waffle. Not having either a waffle iron or a pizelle iron, I have tried making these on an electric griddle, but since the batter is fairly thick it wouldn't spread into a large enough circle to make cones from.     When you form the cones, there will probably be a small hole in the bottom of them that ice-cream can drip out of. One idea for plugging this hole is to put miniature marshmallows in the bottoms of the cones.    I hope this works for you!|`|bc7f3553bf146f87af4db38b8029cf3eaa	American Ice Cream Recipe  From LoveToKnow Recipes      adright        * Categories: Dessert Recipes: Ice Cream Recipes      * Add to My Recipe Box      * My Recipe Box      * Print: Full Page | 3x5 | 4x6      * Email to Friend    Ingredients for American Ice Cream Recipe        * 1 pint milk      * 2 tablespoons flour      * 2 tablespoons water      * ? cup sugar      * 2 egg yolks      * 1 cup heavy cream      * 1 teaspoon vanilla     Instructions       1.
