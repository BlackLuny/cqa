With the recent news of everyone over at TNA losing faith in Jeff for not coming up with nothing in TNA lately I see why Vince isnt worried about them.      1. They let petey go. Yeah sure WWE cant do nothing with him but he was one of the guys that made TNA so it would of been best to keep him around to give TNA its look.      2. I feel Book will go back to WWE soon. because TNA has lost their momentum... like last year they was on the rise with challanges and surprises, this year so far each week kinda BLA. like the whole sTING AND KURT FIGHT.      3. Theres only so many times you can do the Kurt wins the belt back and the following week he starts feuding with JOE AGAIN AND AGAIN. the same guy.      what do you think

Using Eddie Guerrero's death as a storyline... shame on Vicki for allowing this   3. Kane trying to set RVD on fire with gasoline. Not a good influence...   4. Vince forcing Trish to bark like a dog in the middle of the ring - received many complainst from women and womens rights activists   5. Shawn Staziak Chuck Palumbo gay wedding... they got beat up and received complaints from the gay and lesbian community   6. Undertaker locking up Ultimate Warrior in a air tight coffin. This received complaints ages ago.. must of been early 90s   7. Randy Orton kicking Vince in the head while he was laying on the ground... this got under my skin   8. Randy Orton again... attacking Stephanie while shes not expecting it. I think Orton is making a habit of getting involved in the list..

20090220150448AA3etY2	Sports;Other - Sports	Do you think its wrong to take an animals fur?	I am a hunter, I hunt moose, elk, bear, deer, coyote, bobcat, and wolves. Pretty much everything really that is legal of course. I am against things like fur farms and places that slaughter animals and beat them. I think that is horrible and that there is no respect for them. I hunt mainly for the food and the animals features, such as teeth, claws, fur. I take every part of the animal and try to conserve as much as possible. I usually put the fur, teeth, claws and anything else in my room to sort of honor them after I eat them, knowing that I wont forget them and how they died. I have a lot of respect for animals, and never would slaughter one or beat it, just a clean quick shot. I did skin a bear and when I go to the mountains and hunt I wear it on me to keep me warm but not for fashion. I think to turn it into a jacket at a store and sell it is bad but to wear its claws/teeth as a necklace or fur to keep warm when I'm hunting is more of honor and respect. Kind of what the Indians did. What do you guys think?

20090220153223AACL5l7	Sports;Auto Racing;Formula One	Question about the 1986 Australian GP?	We all know about the famous tire blow up that Mansell had while running in position to win the WDC, but do you remember that Keke Rosberg first had a tire failure in his McLaren which put him out of the race while leading? Subsequently this put Nelson Piquet in the lead and in position to win the WDC after Mansell's DNF. However, the Williams team and Piquet (or one or the other) decided to pit for fresh rubber. This pretty much handed the title to Prost who went on to win the race.      Hypothetically speaking, If your were Nelson Piquet would you have stayed out on track and took the risk of having a massive tire failure (sort of like Kimi decided to do in Germany 05), or would you have played it safe the way the team, or Nelson, or both decided to do?      No right or wrong to this...just a hypothetical question.

20090220155051AAKnxsa	Sports;Hockey	Am I missing something?	Everyone seems to have a problem with the fact that Sundin said he didn't want to be a rental player, but went and signed with Vancouver anyway. When he said he wanted to be with the team from the beginning, right from training camp, I he meant it more as an analogy for sticking with the team you started with.  If you start with a team, whether it's from training camp, or Christmas, -once you've made that commitment- you stick with it.  I always had the impression that Sundin didn't want to be a rental player for two reasons:      ~ It would mean abandoning the team he is the captain of, leaving them to worry about the mess they all got themselves into, while he has it easy on a top level team.   ~ It would mean disturbing the team he's going to, by forcing players on that team to be traded for him.      Both of these seem like logical, and selfless reasons.  His sighing with Vancouver does not contradict either of those reason. Yet some people say that he's a hypocrite for signing with Vancouver.  What exactly did he do wrong?

Helton and Tulo having comeback years.  The pitching is going to be better I think.  Cook is a stud, Jimenez is healthy and Marquis will be a nice veteran.  I like de la Rosa as a number 4 guy and if one of our young prospects are good enough, that would be a nice number 5.  The bullpen is good and great from 7-9 inning with Corpas/Street, Buckholtz, and Corpas/Street.  I also think Hirsh is going to come back and show why is was ranked as one of the best pitching prospects when we traded for him.

20090220144855AALpFBu	Sports;Volleyball	Will improving flexibility in my transverse adominals improve my jumping ability?	I was wondering if having flexible abs helps in jumping ability? If so, how can it help. Stretching my abdominal muscles and trying to get more range of motion by leaning back as far as possible every time I stretch. For some reason, when I used to stretch all the time I used to say to myself because it's not the legs there's no need to stretch them. As I got older I understood that everything connects. My upper body is really tight due to the fact I never really stretched my upper body on my lower body. Do you think having a more flexible upper body and range of motion will help my jumping ability?

20090220141803AAxsYVg	Sports;Football (Soccer);2006 FIFA World Cup(TM)	A better distribution of spots for the World Cup?	This is MY distribution:   Europe gets 14 spots   Africa: 4   Asia: 4   North America: 4   South America: 4   Oceania: 1   Now you may be saying "That's only 31 spots. You need one more." Well I have the answer: Give the last spot to the continent the World Cup is on. This works perfectly for those 4 continents with 4 spots (Africa, Asia, North America, and South America).   For example, this year, according to my formula, Africa will get 5 spots instead of 4. Now you may be saying "That isn't fair", but if you think about it, it is fair. Since South Africa is already in the World Cup, it's like Africa has 4 spots.   Now what if the World Cup is in Europe or Oceania? I have two options:   1. Give the last spot to Europe/ Oceania.   2. Let the four continents with 4 spots play for it. (Like a playoff or something)   I've haven't decided what would be better.   Or maybe this formula sucks and how they currently distribute spots is fine.   Thoughts?

20090220153035AAaThao	Sports;Baseball	Cubs fans, trade rumors surrounding Kosuke Fukudome?	It's rumored that several teams have contacted the Cubs and are interested in trading for Fukudome.  The Seattle Mariners have been the most aggressive offering Jarod Washburn or Erik Bedard.  Is this a trade you would make? Would either of these players make the Cubs any better.      In my opinion I think it's too early to give up on Fukudome.  He didn't have the best rookie season, but he's a lefty bat and a great defender which is something the Cubs need badly on their roster.  Their pitchng staff is pretty set so we don't really need another pitcher. Would this be a good move for the Cubs?  Thoughts, comments?

I would enter and give stone cold stunners to the whole raw roster,then on ecw i would do the same, and then on smackdown. And then hhh would say me vs you right here,right now. First one to do their finisher first wins. If you beat me i will give you a title shot against me next week hhh says. I win and give him a stunner. Next week i almost beat him. I give him a stunner and then go for the pin. Undertaker interfers and it turns out no contest. Me vs undertaker at wm 30. I win and beat undertaker. I have done the impossible. I also qaulify and win the money in the bank that night. The next night on raw It is world champ shawn michaels vs wwe champ hhh for undisputed chmpion. Shawn wins and then i cash in mony in da/the bank and beat shawn for both champions. And then vince mcman says i am a 1 time wwe chmpion and a hvy world chmp. But he is stripping me of the titles because he says i am too new to new to hold a title. I go up to him and give him a stcs(stunner). In the next year i go on to win every title and at wm 31 i beat vice and retire him. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJkdrkFkD...

Why do people think they have a right to say footballers get paid to much and doctors should get as much, if that was the case are taxes would be like 1000 pound a week, we dont pay footballers wages, (unless you buy tickets) so it doesnt effect are lives, in fact footballes pay more tax in one year, than we pay in a lifetime, if you want docters to get paid that much, get them sponserd buy addidas, i hate people that only see that footballes get paid more than doctors, but dont think why.

And It's Triple H as WWE champ, Edge as World Heavyweight champ? DEJA-VU. But I'll bet that Triple H is gonna jump back to Raw and bring the WWE title with him, then play mind games with Randy Orton to get him to use is 'Rumble win on him. And I hope that's what happens too. I can't believe Randy nailed Steph O' Mac with an RKO on Monday and Triple H came out and was so mad he was shivering like Hulk Hogan does when he's p***** off. So I'll bet that's what's gonna happen tonight. What do you think?

20090220142823AA2h8oa	Sports;Golf	Picking up your ball on the green.?	I'm watching the Northern Trust Open and all they players are marking their ball, picking it up, spinning it around, then placing it back down and playing it. This is all when they are away.       Do they do this to clean it up? Get a better side to hit?      Is this legal in amateur play?      This just seems weird to me because you obviously can't pick up your ball in the fairway or rough to clean it off, but you can on the green? The only logic I can come away with is that all the other golfers on the green get to pick up there ball (to mark it and remove it out of the way of play).

Because its his wife that got hurt and he looked kinda mad.....      3.seems like most of theses wrestlers arent made strong anymore. How is it that Hulk is thinking about wrestling at WM when stone cold is hurt...even Ric flair could get back in the ring.. and they are like 20 years older than stone cold.      4. last year we saw him return with his "hoz" but do you think he will come back this year with PG being in effect?  He couldnt even say his lil speech" once again its time to run on the ________ train"??(sexy train??? lol)

20090203065247AAZUxbJ	Sports;Hockey	I understand there's a certain amount of loyalty, but why do great players stay with awful teams.?	I'm not talking about a team who is terrible once every few years, I mean a team that just never gets better. (Good example of this is Shane Doan). Until this year, why would he continue to stay with a team that was always going in the wrong direction

20090220155517AA4p9ur	Sports;Hockey	A Blockbuster Just For Fun?	Now I know this will not happen but I just took all the rumoured names out there and drafted up a fantasy blockbuster 4 way deal. Tell me if you think it would help all the teams and if anyone would be getting screwed?      To Montreal: Daniel Briere, Pavel Kubina      To Philly: Tomas Kaberle, Jordan Staal      To Pittsburgh: Alexei Kovalev, Nik Antropov      To Toronto: James Van Riemsdyk, PK Subban, Philly 1st Rounder, Pittsburgh 1st rounder      Justification:      The Habs are looking to make a big splash and are not happy with Kovalev, what would be better than bringing in a star French guy?      Philly is looking to improve their defence but does not have the cap space to do it, however clearing Briere would allow for that, and they get a solid young center in Staal to replace Briere      Pittsburgh is interested in adding scoring to go along with Crosby and Malkin, and Kovalev and Antropov would accomplish this      The Leafs are in a full out rebuild and adding prospects of this caliber and a couple first rounders would be HUGE for them
