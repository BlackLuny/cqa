20090309181104AA3Hvjc	Environment;Green Living	Why does society still think that a 4 year college education is a good deal? I see students clamoring for?	student loans that they actually think they will be able to pay back in a reasonable amount of time. With the economy in shambles with no reasonable time table for recovery, how can they even find a job to pay back the loans? The U.S. economy hasn't got a iota of a chance for recovery unless we produce jobs that actually make something, or grow something that we can sell to other countries. The agriculture sector is in dire straits as the cost of fuel , fertilizer, and pesticides increase exponentially every year, wholly because of our dependence on petroleum products to produce and transport our food. That time is fast approaching an end. We need to start thinking locally about our businesses and farming. Globalization is dead since it depends on the availability of petrofuels, especially aviation fuels. It seems that everyone is clamoring to avoid the slower, agrarian lifestyle at all costs, which depends on slower railroads and boats. Don't we need to revamp our education system so that we produce more farmers, craftsman, and tradesman, rather than people who don't produce anything tangible? The exception to this question would be the medical community which would require a good education. But, like in Russia, a doctor only has to go to 5 years of medical school without having to attend pre-med which is usually a bachelors degree in some field related or not related to medicine here in the U.S. I feel that we will need to submit to a change in our lifestyle voluntarily, or it will be forced upon us by the reality of our energy situation. Most of the alternative energy projects produce electricity, and at a much lower amount than our coal fired generators. Also, solar power is not a steady source of power since the sun doesn't shine 24/7/365 in most places and will depend on batteries to back them up. I haven't seen a battery that could make up for the variations in electricity production caused by the sun not being there all the time. At least not at the rate the U.S. uses electricity. Oil and Gas are a lost cause due to the decline in the availability and pollution factors. Transporting these commodities will be a problem as the cost of fuel increases, along with the potential of spot shortages. Wouldn't we be better off committing ourselves to the type of education that will help us live the life that we will ultimately end up having to live anyways? The Amish community only requires that their children only attend school for 8 years. I am sure that we will require a little more than that like maybe 12 years of High School with the emphasis on trades, farming, home economics. and physicians assistants which would be what most agrarian communities would require.
