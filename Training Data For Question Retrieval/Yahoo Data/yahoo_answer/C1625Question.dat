Each Michigan State Police District has a specially modified truck that can catapult from snow-plow to intercept speed in seconds.      Starting March 1, 2009, Michigan launched a 31-day speeding ticket frenzy to bring in an estimated $9 million dollars in speeding tickets and $3.5 million in failure to wear a seat belt. There are state troopers on duty 24/7 patrolling areas with the highest rates of speeding.      They are: * I-75 from the Ohio line north to Woodhaven, and from Auburn Hills to Flint * I-96 east and west in its entirety * I-275 north and south * I-675 north and south * I-94 east and west from Battle Creek to Jackson * I-696 east and west in its entirety * I-196 east and west * US-131 north and south * I-69 east and west from Lansing to Flint and from Flint eastward to Port Huron * I-69 north and south from I-94 to Lansing * M-14 east and west from I-94 to I-275 * M-39 from I-94 to I-96 * M-59 from Pontiac to Utica, and from Utica east * US-10 from Midland to Bay City * US-23 from I-96 to Flint * US-27 from Lansing to Mt. Pleasant      Quotas:  5 mph above the limit can justify a ticket.  Each trooper is supposed to write a ticket every 10 to 20 minutes.      FYI - Driving ticket fine increase:  Starting January 15th, the price of a ticket for violation of MI Law 39:3-29 (failure to show your driver's license, registration, or proof of insurance card at the time you are stopped) went from $44.00 to $173.00.

Just before our plane pushed back from the gate, the ground guys drove this big cart next to the airplane. They took out a rather long tan looking hose, skinny, and hooked somewhere under the plane. After that the cart started making this really loud, high pitch, noise and then the engine on the other side the plane started. I didn't think they started engines until they were well away from the gate. At least in all the other times I've flown. I just thought that was the weirdest thing.

What is the best way to book these? I looked on Eurorails website and tried booking through Expedia as well. No dice. It wont bring up any tickets.    Do I need to book an Italy train pass and a Norway train pass? How do I get from place to place?       We're flying in to Rome, 3 travelers, we'stay in Rome a few days, make our way though northern Italy then head to Norway to Oslo, Lofoten and the Fjords.      Full Trip dates are July 21 through August 11...or around there.      We need inner Europe transportation advice!!! And any must see places if they come to mind :)      Thanks!

20090227062801AALHycN	Travel;Air Travel	Why British airport policy is so wired!?	If you are not EU or US ppl and need to go through Heathrow airport, possibly you are experiencing the worst experience in Europe. The visa law is so complicated, and wired that you must suffer a lot!      Say for example, if u travel by qatar air, 5 star air line.. u need to go from terminal 1 to terminal 3. And for this u need a visa! This so called famous airport seems not caring the passengers except from EU or US. Coz, they could tunnel up all the terminals like other standard modern airport that helps the passenger, not bother or irritate. Is it a poor way for them to earn money from visa fees? Its completely irritating...

We used the train as our means to travel so we got to see a lot of the countryside. This time, we have a 12 day Greek Isle cruise departing out of Venice. Our plane lays over in Zurich, so we thought we might get off the plane there instead and jump on a train and see some of Switzerland (and maybe part of Germany) then meander our way down to Italy - perhaps spending only a night at each destination or maybe staying on the amalfi coast. We like to travel fast and see as much as possible! We have a total of 3 nights.  Any 4-5 star hotels, points of interest, cities to visit or recommended itineraries would certainly be appreciated. We plan on purchasing a 3-country train pass.
