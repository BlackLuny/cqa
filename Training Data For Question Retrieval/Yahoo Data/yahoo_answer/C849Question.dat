It was a first-time homebuyers loan, and the only stipulation was that you couldn't sell your house for a profit for at least seven years.    Here's the problem: my wife and I would like to move and build a house.  However, we only paid $50,000 for our house.  We bought it from someone we knew that needed the money, quickly, so they sold it for cheap.  Similar houses in the neighborhood are selling for around $65,000.  I'd like to find a way to get out from under my current mortgage.  I don't think I can just give my house away.  We've probably put $5,000 into it since we bought it.  What can I do?

For economics I need to analyze an article regarding 'Slow market cuts time to build new home in half'      In the article it states that at March 2006 it took on average 1 year to construct an average home due to a huge boom which caused an over load in demand...and of course a short fall in supply. However due to a hike in interest rates and the fact that homes had become too expensive for many home buyers to purchase, the time it took to build a home during March 2007 had halved, to taking only 6 months from construction to completetion.      I know that this has to be a case of Demand Falling, but what about supply...does it increase or it says the same because only demand falls.

20070522121734AAkXmI3	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Qual o valor do dinheiro em nossa cultura? COMENTE (vide detalhes)?	"Nossa cultura perdeu muito de seus valores tradicionais. O dinheiro é a única coisa que sobrou para estimular os desejos e as aspira??es da maioria das pessoas. O dinheiro tomou o lugar ou entrou profundamente no mundo da religi?o, do patriotismo, da arte, do amor e da ciência....Os ricos e os pobres lutam por dinheiro por raz?es muito diferentes. Mas quem é pobre entende algo sobre o dinheiro que os ricos n?o entendem. E o contrário também é verdadeiro. Os pobres sentem o poder do dinheiro na própria pele. Uma pessoa rica freqüentemente sente isso nas suas emo??es, n?o no seu corpo. Quem é rico sabe que com dinheiro, muitas vezes, você pode manipular, blefar, e fazer o que você quiser. Mas até um certo ponto. Sabe interiormente que há algo essencial na condi??o humana que o dinheiro n?o compra."             (JACOB NEEDLEMAN, entrevista à EXAME, edi??o 645, p.76).

The lady i spoke to on the phone wasn't very helpful and said that i could try it, but i'd like a more definitive answer before i pull on my snowshoes tomorrow and traipse off to a Halifax branch, only to be told off by them for wasting their time.  Bankers always make me feel so inferior ;-)   So, what say you?  Will i get the cheque safely deposited into my account, or will i have to entrust it into the hands of the Royal Mail, and send it up to my mother to deposit for me?      Many thanks in advance.   :)

I went Bankrupt last week and have my official telephone interview with the official receiver this week. What is asked / said in the interview ? I am so nervous.

If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning." --Andrew Jackson      Keep in mind that all banks and especially the private Federal Reserve Banks use fractional-reserve banking. "Fractional-reserve banking refers to the common banking practice of issuing more money than the bank holds as reserves. Banks in modern economies typically loan their customers many times the sum of the cash reserves that they hold."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-...    These banks are loaning out much more money than they actually have and are charging interest on fake money that has no asset backing. This creates inflation and reduces the purchasing power of the dollar. The purchasing power of the dollar has fallen by 96% since the Fed was created. What else will it take for people to abolish the unconstitutional Fed?

I am trying to sign up for weekend dental assistant school in appleton wi at the advanced care smile center, the class fee and book fee are about 2900 dollars.  the fee is due before April 4th. I don't think I will be able to come up with that much, and since it is a private school the traditional student loan doesn't qualify.  I have poor credit- so I was looking for a personal loan, these traditionaly have higher interest rates, but whenever I internet search for  "Personal loan for 2000 dollars" I only come up with scary cash advance places with an interest rate of 90% YIKES   Can someone help me weed through this B.S. and find a way to finance my edu.   Also, is it possible to do like a candybar fundraiser for this kind of thing, or are only reasons allowed like for schools?      Let me know.      P.s.... I am not asking anyone for money or even implying it, just looking for where to find it or creative ways to get it, so please no replys yelling at me or telling me to get a job, because I have one, but I also have 3 kids...

20070709144306AAlNhYc	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Is there a way that employees (applicants) can check the reference of a company (potential employer)?	Employees have well known resources to check the references of potential employees and very liberal rights on how far they can go to do so--down to looking at our life history through background checks and credit checks,  dipping in our urine, blood, and pulling out our hair to check for drugs.  One place even asked me to present former employer W-2 forms.     What rights do we have as potential employees? I'm sure there are "Companies From Hell", with a big name that you have worked for and would not refer a friend OR your worst enemy to. Because the company itself is successful and well known does not mean anyone would want to work there or that they treat their employees fairly, don't descriminate, don't watch over your shoulder through a microscope, after they check your piss and credit, etc., etc., etc.  How do we--the people, who are at much greater risk of loss, pain, and suffering if out of a job, than companies if out of an employee--exercise prevention like they do?

20061222090020AAvqIiS	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	What does the recruiter care???	I was placed at my current job by a recruiter 6 months ago. I gave 2 weeks notice yesterday morning and last night I got a call from my recruiter asking me what happened and apparently he knew that I was going back to school. I didn't talk to him much as I was out to dinner (I answered because like my mom, he blocks his numer from caller ID and I thought it was my mom). He was very insistent about calling me at a later time. What the F**k does he care what I'm doing? What should I do/say when he calls back
