20090203101823AAqDePE	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	98 chevy cavalier overheating and running towards the hot ?	I have a 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier. When I first got it their was no heat and it was running towards the end of the heating line. Replaced the thermostat(checked the old one afterwards & found out it really was junk) and flushed out the hoses, this got the heat working. We flushed the radiator and filled it with coolant. It has an electric fan, the fan is indeed working. Today the car started to go past the white line and towards the red so I pulled it over. When it gets to that temp, everything gets hot EXCEPT the radiator. My heater is working good now, so we dont believe it is the heater core, but are wondering if anyone has any suggestions of what could be going on with it. We didnt see any leaks at the water pump or pulley, but heard that its possible that the bearings could have just worn out and need replacing. My father has been saying that the hoses felt soft and as if no water had been flowing thru.

Anything over 28mph it will start slipping.        HOWEVER!!!  once that half block is reached the transmission shifts into drive.  From that point on no slippage and acts as a transmission should.  Shifts at 15 and again at 24mph.         Anyone ever hear of this issue and what it was?  Or how to address it without spending a buttload of money at a local tranny shop.  My guess is a fluid pressure buildup issue or a solinoid in the tranny. But I am not versed in chrysler front wheel drive trannys.      Thanks      AND NO IT DOES NOT HAVE A VACUUM MODULATOR!

20090219191802AAtNfmI	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Pulled over for driving without insurance without realising?	My friend was stopped a few weeks ago for driving another friends car, the police have since issued penalty notices to both parties for fines of ￡200 and 6 points a piece but the whole thing seems very confusing. The guy driving has 3 insurance policies, one for work, one for driving his girlfriends car and one for his taxi business so he assumed he was insured to drive the car although he wasn't a named driver. The police spoke to them both at the scene and said they'd check the details and be in touch (which they were a few days later) and everything seemed in order. Nothing was signed at the time, no rights were read (extreme but I'm trying to paint a picture) and no paperwork swapped hands to produce documents etc. My question is this, do my friends have a case to fight the penalty? This happened in a different district to where we live and our local police have hinted this is a bit of a farce. All answers appreciated.

20090219175402AAUxN7F	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chrysler	I have a '99' Chrysler LHS and it smells like something died in it!?	I absolutely love my car. It's a Chrysler LHS! Hi Five! Anyway for the past two years I have been having a problem with the air coming from the vents inside smelling like something died in it! To best describe it, like a dead rat or sour milk!  I first noticed the odor when the freon was low. So I had it serviced, no leaks, filled up nicely no problem and no odor. It happened again 'bad odor' had the unit serviced this time the odor was a lil faint but still there. I had my heater core serviced   nothing wrong with it, no leaks under the dash no condensation on the windshield ac blows wonderful, heater heats up and blows wonderfully BUT still funky as hell. Took it to a mechanic again thinking the third time would be a charm. I was told that Chrysler's were known to have fungus and mold accumulate in the ventilation system and that he'd have to order this fungicide that only Chrysler sells for their cars.   this cost me $100.00! smell went away for about 4 months. But back again. Paid the $100.00 again smell went away for about a week. But now....yep back again and with a stinking vengeance. Should I just have the heater core replaced anyway? What is causing this funky odor in my car. And For the record to my knowledge it was not a 'death car' before I took ownership of it 5 years ago.

20090219185705AA9bIJ7	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chrysler	Reliability of chrysler new yorker 1993 ?	hi      I have to buy a used car, quite old as I don't have that much money to spend, and I would like an american one.      I see a chrysler new-yorker year 1993 with 3.3 V6.   It doesn't come with the service history, but has had a new muffler, and doesn't need timing belt to be changed, as it is a chain and not a belt.      the price is 900$.      But what I would like to know is if the model is known to have particular problem. Or is it known to be a particular dependable car ?   I know that the 90's are not the best decade for the US car reliability ...      What should I pay attention to, specifically to this model and year ?      Please, if you own or owned this type of Chrysler, let me know what you think about it.   thx       jb

20090219190939AAnUOb1	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How to fix my broken life?	Okay so, I think my life is truly, dull and messed up. Don't know where to start.... I'm thirteen and my life is pretty boring I have a hard time making friends. Don't have much a social life. Don't get out much. The reason why I don't have many friends is probably because of the people who find amusement in abusing my short temper. I don't say anything mean to anyone unless they say something mean to me. I like my few friends, but, when I go to school I am annoyed for reasons I don't know. I'm not gay but all my friends are guys. Dunno, girls hate me, (<<Have no clue.) That one behind me < probably the most irritating. I don't know how to make friends, frighteningly. My life is like a path that just gets more and more disturbing as it goes. Few of my friends starting doing drugs, the next part unfortunately isn't going to be mentioned. I'm always bored, and feel sick a lot. I don't do drugs and I think I manage my hygiene pretty well. Anyway, my life is also getting boring. I have 2 groups of friends. The ones that respect me and the ones i just go to school with and they make rascist jokes day after day. I carry on with my daily routine. Get up, go to school,eat lunch, go straight home. Where do I start and how to fix all the problems listed?

20090219200320AAuzQ95	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Who would be at fault for this accident if there was an accident?	I had a close accident today. There were 4-5 cars stopped at a red light and I was turning right at the intersection ahead. There is a right turn lane with pavement markings on the road, but since it appeared all of the cars ahead were going straight, I went to the right side just a few feet before the pavement markings indicating the turn lane (I had room). When I went to the right, the car ahead attempted to go over to the turn lane, I stopped and they stopped too, and then I proceeded. That car didn't have a right turn signal on; if it did I would have waited for it to go in the turn lane first (I'm not a mind reader). So, if there was an accident here, who would be at fault?       Taking into account a force of impact, it'll probably look like the other drivers fault since it'll appear my car was in the turn lane first and the other car ran into me going into the turn lane when I was already in it.      Anyway, I'm glad there wasn't any accident. I'm glad the other car stopped and I stopped too just in case, but if the other car didn't stop and continue to go into the turn lane, there would have been an accident because the front of my car was on the side of the rear/back seat of his car.

20090219202809AAbpljt	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car Overheating - Faulty Coolant System?	So my 1992 Jetta has been overheating for the past while. I'm clueless about what to do about it. I have just replaced the thermostat, water pump, and the v-belt, but the car is still overheating. Overheating can't be due to a faulty water pump, a thermostat stuck closed, or a defective v-belt...      The car overheats, and when I shut it off, the cooling fan comes on. Since the car is going to overheat, my warm air conditioning won't work. I also checked my dip-stick and all that was on there was good oil, so I don't think it has much to do with a head gasket, but it might.      I have NO coolant loss at all right now. And the upper radiator hose is so hot, and I can feel the coolant boiling inside of it.      Also, the first time it REALLY overheated, I had a cracked flange at the top center of my motor, and white smoke came BELLOWING out! And when I was trying to drive it home, TONS of white smoke was coming out of my back end... Could this have anything to do with a gasket? Did a gasket blow BECAUSE the engine was overheating, or does a blown gasket CAUSE a car to overheat???      Car sounds pretty normal...      WHAT'S GOING ON?!

20090219202438AAJFuP4	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Help! Rental Car Hold?	I rented a car with Enterprise yesterday, I was told there would be a $350 hold on my debit card. I assumed it was just HOLDING the money but not actually withdrawing the money until I took the car back. I checked my account today, after i returned the car and they charged me the 350 which in turn put my account at a negative amount. And everything i charged after that i am being charged the overdraft fee on top of the charges. So now i am in the hole over $200 dollars. Is this right? Are they supposed to take that money out or just hold it until you come back? The last time i rented with them, it was just held in my account, and not actually deducted from my account. Please help!

20090219203508AAmy7s2	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Installing a suspension lift kit yourself?	I recently bought a truck and it sits pretty low for what i would like a truck to be and i was wondering if i could install a lift kit myself rather then taking it to a shop and having to pay out the *** to get it installed. I would probably put a 4-6 inch lift on it. I do have a lot of experience working on cars and I am currently going to school for automotive. However i have never put a lift kit on a vehicle before and i would love to do this myself to gain the experience since by working in the automotive field i will probably need it. Also how long do u think this would take me and my friend? And what kind of tools would i specifically need? I have plenty of tools but i want to make sure i have everything i need before i start. Any places or websites that have good quality lift kits would also be greatly appreciated.

20090219204111AABNGjU	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	Should ex-wife still go to Sun N Fun airshow after divorcing Pilot husband?	Husband and wife went to big airshow every year. They divorced this past year. She loved going to this big event still wants to go even though she is not a pilot. Although this airshow is quite massive there is still a great chance she will run into some of their past acquaintances and she is afraid she will feel strange and feel they would wonder why she was still coming to this event. On the flip side she feels it is a week in sunny Florida and Springtime. She could do volunteer work and that would allow her to meet new people and still be around things she loved doing for many years. What do you think she should do? The couple split amicably and mutually so there is no animosity there.
