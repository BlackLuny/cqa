Mncm0h5Faa	They actually can last for several months without going bad, but a lot depends on where they're kept.  If you keep them in the carton they last a lot longer than in the refrigerator door.  No one can say for sure whether the eggs were still good or not because we don't know how they were stored, but most likely the eggs were fine.  Expiration dates are basically a worst case scenario and the people who decide those things assume the average consumer is going to not store stuff properly, so the eggs won't last long.  Plus, they're covering their butt by making the date really close to the day you buy the eggs, so if there is one will a crack or something that does go bad, they can say, look, the carton of eggs is old.<br>  <br>  Check out my articles on keeping eggs fresh longer and knowing if they're safe to eat for more information.  I listed them in the sources section.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	They're ok for 3-4 days after expiration date, but not that far. Your father is wrong, they DO go bad.|`|sG5FKmAYaa	Properly looked after they last for months. <br>  <br>  Dad is correct.<br>  EXPIRATION DATE A date on an egg carton beyond which the eggs should not be sold. –see Carton Dates<br>  <br>  The "sell by" or "best if used by" or "exp (date)" are all expressions used by the industry in various states, and are used by the retailer to assure you of freshness. The egg will continue to be fresh for at least another 2-3 weeks if it has been refrigerated from the time packed until used at 45 degrees F. or lower. As the egg ages, it does lose some of its qualities, so if you were baking a cake or whipping meringue, your cake might not rise as high as expected, and you might not get the volume of meringue you would expect, so for baking purposes it is better to use a fresher egg.<br>  <br>  Older eggs are great to use when hard-cooking (boiled) as they will peel easier. They will keep for about a week in the shell, 2-3 weeks if peeled and placed in a freezer bag.<br>  <br>  When frying an older egg, it will spread out further in the pan, as the white (albumen) gets thinner. When fresh, the yolk will stand high and the white will stay close to the yolk in your pan. Nothing wrong with cooking the older egg, it just doesn't look as nice. <br>  <br>  The term "rotten egg" seldom occurs today, thanks to refrigeration. The interior of the egg will probably evaporate before it becomes "rotten". We have seen eggs several months old still very usable, but could not recommend you that you do this!|`|tRcO5uyiaa	People used to raise laying hens for eggs on farms (or even in their backyards) and collected them daily and they were used within 1-2 days. That is the freshest they can be. However, since eggs are now mass produced (and injected with chemicals for longer shelf life - ick), they are sent from the manufacturing plant to the wholesaler within hours of production and the wholesaler marks the egg cartons with the expiry date. They are immediately delivered to the retail stores for purchase. They do sit during the time of production to the time of sale approx. 3-4 days already before the consumer buys them. In reality, the eggs aren't fresh anymore by the time you get them to your home. The chemicals injected into the eggs make them taste 'funny' and also spoil the eggs more quickly (ironically). So, unfortunately for dad, you are correct.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	I've probably eaten them up to a week after they've expired. Beyond that I've thrown 'em out.|`|eJ7t5Xgyaa	Put eggs in a pot.  Cover with cold water.  Good eggs stay on the bottom.   Bad eggs will float.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Not that long, definitely not three weeks.|`|ea2aCkB8aa	Haven't you heard of eggs gone bad or rotten eggs? They can smell real terrible and give you a real tummy ache if eaten.<br>  These eggs have been packed and tagged with an expiry date for a reason.<br>  It is obvious these eggs should be eaten by the expiry date or latest on the expiry date itself or 1 - 2 days after.<br>  <br>  The expiry date ensures the eggs are freshest and safest when consumed.<br>  You can still eat some eggs after the expiry date, depending on the conditions and environment in which they were stored but you do so at your own risk. Should sickness or food poisoning occur, no company or egg farm may want to take responsibility.<br>  <br>  As for the comment: eggs never expire. I don't think it's very accurate. As all foodstuffs and edibles expire after a given amount of time.<br>  <br>  You were wise to have tossed out the expired eggs. Besides the expiry date was Jan 27th. It's already Feb 23rd now. Almost a month after expiry. Not safe at all I would say.

xdrzKo2paa	I agree with your judgment, it would be very inappropriate for girl scouts, or any scouts regardless of age for that matter. The reasoning for the recipe's ingredient calling for vodka<br>  to Prince Vladimir opinion_ "Russian's merriment cannot be without drinking" but, in my opinion, I deem that the Black Russian Cake, and other Russian pastries that call for liquor are the way they are because treats like Black Russian Cake was a recipe that was formed y the palace's cook staff who worked under the Tsar. If you take into consideration, this was also the same time when the Russian people lived in horrific poverty and food was so scarce that, instead of buying a gallon of milk that (at the time) cost the same as a decent bottle of vodka, a man, sent with a meager grocery store list from his wife  would most likely opt for the vodka and tell her to substitute it in place of the milk if they could not afford the milk, flour, sugar and the vodka. <br>  <br>  I recommend you substitute the vodka measurements with soy milk. Remember, many children are lactose intolerant and plus, most brands of soy milk have more calcium in it than 90% of the milk's in the supermarket!. Additionally, make sure you do not get almond milk!. While almond milk is very surprisingly tasty, almond's area kind of nut and nut allergies are very high in children.|`|eL268hETaa	If it's baked, then the alcohol gets removed... leaving only the FLAVOR behind.

BK30XyGraa	I have made this pastry loads of times - but completely agree with the other people - Buy it! There's hardly anything I'd rather buy than make at home: but this is one!You can buy all butter versions, so I think it can't be any different to that which I'd make at home (it doesn't have many ingredients after all).<br>  <br>  However, it's satisfying to have made it at least once - you can then make up your own mind about home-made versus shop-bought. The key is to have everything cold and enough time for all the "resting" - which is essential.<br>  <br>  Butter Puff Pastry<br>  Serves: makes 450g puff pastry<br>   Prep: 45 min, plus 25 mins resting time <br>   Ingredients<br>  225g plain flour<br>  1/2 tsp Salt<br>  1 tsp lemon juice<br>  cold water, to mix<br>  225g unsalted Butter<br>  <br>  Method 1. Sift the flour and salt together into a mixing bowl. <br>  <br>  2. Make a hollow in the middle of the flour. Pour the lemon juice into the hollow and mix into the flour. Add enough cold water to form a pastry ball. <br>  <br>  3. Place the pastry on a floured surface and knead gently for 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and not sticky. <br>  <br>  4. Roll out the pastry until it forms a square large enough to wrap around the butter. <br>  <br>  5. Place the butter (straight from the fridge) in the middle of the pastry. Fold the pastry over the butter. <br>  <br>  6. Using a rolling pin, flatten the pastry-wrapped butter slightly. Roll it out gently and evenly into a long strip, making sure the butter remains contained within the pastry. <br>  <br>  7. Fold a third of the pastry strip towards the middle, then top with the remaining pastry flap, making a triple-layered piece of pastry. <br>  <br>  8. Gently press this down without sealing the edges. Set aside to rest in a cool place for 15 minutes. <br>  <br>  9. Place the pastry on a floured surface so that the unsealed edge is towards you. Repeat the rolling and folding process four more times. <br>  <br>  10. Set aside to rest in a cool place for 10 minutes. Place the pastry on a floured surface so that the unsealed edge is towards you. Repeat the rolling and folding process three more times.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XcNoptFbaa	Buy it.

fkX0TiYVaa	yes there is a differnce bottle water is puriffied alot more and does not contain all of the minirals and chemicals that bottle water contains<br>  <br>  In the US, the FDA requires that bottlers provide something equivalent to, not better than tap-water. In some cases, they can't even do that. Independent surveys have shown that a number of those bottles have contaminant levels higher than those allowed by public treatment facilities. <br>  <br>  With the exception of a few bottlers that actually own wells, the water in those bottles was someone else's tap water. Sometimes they use effective purification methods. Most times, they don't. That brings me to this question. <br>  <br>  What is the difference between bottled water and tap water, when you are looking at brands like Aquafina, Dasani and Pure-life? All three of these popular brands use the local source. If Coca-cola has a bottling plant in your area and you are buying Dasani, you are buying your own tap-water in a plastic bottle. <br>  <br>  For your health and that of your family, you actually need another choice for drinking water. Data supplied by the University of Cincinnati indicate that every publicly treated source in the US contains some level of contaminants. In some areas, the levels are higher than others, but there are no contaminant-free choices in the US. <br>  <br>  Home purification is a safer and less expensive choice than buying hundreds and hundreds of bottles per year. Beside, unless you are using a good brand of bottled-water for cooking and showering, then you are still exposed to those toxins. That brings me to another question. <br>  <br>  What is the difference between bottled water and tap water that has been run through an effective purification system? In that case, your tap-water is better tasting and healthier. Even the best brands share a common problem. They bottle in plastic. <br>  <br>  During shipping and storage, chemicals used to make the plastic seep into the waters. BPA and phthalates have been in the news lightly. They are known to disrupt the production of hormones within the human body. So, exposure to the substances causes numerous health problems and predisposes the cells to cancer. <br>  <br>  Depending on the type of plastic used by the bottling company, you may be consuming one or more of those chemicals, every time that you drink a bottle. If you are drinking as much as you should, that would be 3-6 bottles per day. That leads to this question. <br>  <br>  What is the difference between bottled water and tap water, in terms of cost? Of course, it depends on the brand, but Evian, for example, costs $25 per gallon. You know how much your water-bill is. Home purification allows you to have gallons of clean water at a cost of less than a dime per gallon. <br>  <br>  I think that explains; what is the difference between bottled water and tap water and now you know about an option that is better than either one. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Gordon Hall is fervent about enabling you and everyone to live a healthy lifestyle, and is an ardent reviewer of Water Purification Systems. Visit his website now at : <a href="http://www.water-safe-and-pure.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.water-safe-and-pure.com</a> to discover which Water Purification Systems Gordon recommends after far ranging and extensive comparisons.|`|pFBaMlI8aa	tap water is filtered only to some extent - the city does not just give you water right out of a lake. it is not filtered enough, however, to be considered true "filtered" water. there are still many chemicals and other pollutants in tap water, but they are in such such small quantities that it is still relatively safe to drink, and you won't get sick or anything from drinking tap water.<br>  bottled water is filtered water, but since it gets stored in a plastic bottle for a certain period of time, the chemicals in the plastic bottle seep into the water and make bottled water about as clean as tap, except for more expensive.<br>  filtered water is not perfectly clean either, but i think it's a better option than either of the two above. it has less pollutants than tap and bottled, and overall is healthier and safer to drink because the filtering process for "filtered" water is more intensive than the regular filtering process for tap. <br>  none of the water you can get today is perfect, but i believe that filtered water is your best option for cleanness.<br>  as for spots or bad skin, i think water probably would help, but it is proven that unless you have some sort of medical condition, you should not force yourself to drink water if you aren't thirsty. it wouldn't hurt, but it is just not necessary.
y8b86tTEaa	Nobody makes the best.  Sorry :)<br>  <br>  I wouldn't choose a kitchen knife because certain chef uses it.<br>  But, if you want the trend today, then Nenohi Nenox knives are used by bunch of Iron Chefs, starting with Morimoto. However, they're not the best, or to be more precise there are other knives that cut better, or last longer or have better something else. The same Morimoto uses those Nenox knives only during the show. He's got bunch of Japanese knives from other makers, like Aritsugu, Masamoto and dunno who else. <br>  <br>  My opinion(of a knife collector, and frankly, I'd trust very few chefs with knife choices) the best performing kitchen knives are made by Japanese makers - Masamoto, Shigefusa, Aritsugu, Watanabe, Tadatsuna, Hattori to name a few.  Those are more expensive than basic western knives, but compared to premium lines of Wusthofs or Henckels they're not that much or sometimes cheaper. As far as cutting goes, Japanese knives cut much better. <br>  <br>  Not that Nenox is cheap, 240mm chef's knife(gyuto) can go up to 600-800$. Very good Aritsugus and Watanabes are much cheaper and perform better, even if they look less fancy. Hattory KD line is over 1000$ a piece, for larger ones up to 2K. <br>  I've seen German custom kitchen knives, priced well over 1000$, performance is nowhere near Japanese knives though, but they sure look pretty.<br>  Phil Wilson makes exceptionally good kitchen knives, also custom.<br>  You can get top notch custom Japanese kitchen knives for 1000 or more if you want to... Performance difference will be not that much compared to let's say 300-400$ knife. <br>  <br>  Are you trying to buy? If that's the case, there is a lot of questions you'd need to answer :) The best is whatever works the best for you after all. Check this link for some info about kitchen knives and choosing them - <a href="http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/misc/articles/kkchoser/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/misc/a...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. As far as cutting goes, Japanese kitchen knives will out-cut German (and any Western kitchen knife) several times. They cut better and they hold the sharp edge longer. I've owned enough of both and sharpened them too.<br>  Simple facts - Average western chef's knife edge is 45-50 degrees. Average Japanese chef's knife edge - 20-30deg. Considerably thinner, therefore much better cutters. <br>  Average Western steel is hardened to 54-56HRC on Rockwell scale. Average Japanese kitchen knife 62HRC and above. Quality pieces go 64-67HRC.<br>  Because of harder metal Japanese knives can hold much thinner edges than softer western knives. I have a few at 8-10 degree edges, 4 times thinner compared to factory edge on Western knives, that's thinner than the straight razor.|`|dqGdxsunaa	germany makes great knives. my grandma has a butcher knife from like the 70's and she still has it and it still works great.|`|Giwigqxhaa	wolfgang|`|I7Ee17s0aa	Wusthof|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	That is a very personal question.

eh3UhLX4aa	Bravo! Always good to know how to cook for oneself, better food, better nutrition, money saved too.  Yes, rinse and pat dry, very dry.  It's really hard to fry damp chicken because you want the coating to stick on and though recipes often dip in milk or egg or both before frying, it's good to start with dry.  Follow the recipe really carefully and get the oil really hot (not butter, it burns).  My earliest disaster with chicken (and I'm from the south and love fried chicken) was biting into a beautiful piece of browned and crunchy-looking chicken only to find it was semi-raw in the middle.  I could not eat chicken for weeks after.  Maybe baked or broiled would be a better starter recipe.  Just sayin'.|`|tIfo0GVqaa	when you remove the chicken from the package, if your lazy like me, then dont rinse.i only rinse if its from like a stall market or butcher.but if its prepacked in a supermarket i wont bother.<br>  <br>  i assume you have a whole chicken.therefore you can clean inside h echicken.use your fingers n pull out its organs.you can then rinse if theres blood or mess.<br>  <br>  around the neck area there is yellow/white really greasy concealedaround the edge.get a pair of scissor and trim away.Trim anymore yellow.white fat if theres any present.<br>  <br>  chop the chickens bottom off.<br>  <br>  again rinse with cold water to get rid of mess<br>  <br>  to make fried chicken pieces<br>  <br>  -1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br>  1 teaspoon kosher salt<br>  1 teaspoon fresh finely ground black pepper<br>  Peanut oil (for deep-frying)<br>  2 eggs<br>  1 tablesppon of water<br>  <br>   pat dry chicken with paper towels. <br>  <br>  cut chicken into 9 pieces (2 legs, 2 thighs, 2 breasts, 2 wings, and 1 or 2 pieces from the back). <br>  <br>  combine the flour, salt and pepper in a large paper bag.<br>  <br>  add enough oil to a 2-inch-deep cast iron skillet to come 2/3 up sides of skillet (about 2 cups of oil).

I would personally use chocolate cake mix because the packaging is dark. Also, I would cut off the sides to make it more candy bar shaped, or use an elongated pan.<br>  <br>  The main two options you have would be to either make the Mars Bar wrapped or partially unwrapped. Wrapped would be easier because then you could frost the entire cake with chocolate frosting and use red and white icing gels or a frosting bag with a special icing tip. For the "wrapper" ends, it could just be cardboard with zig-zags. The partially unwrapped cake just means you would have to ice the cake differently. Maybe use some black food coloring to mix into the chocolate frosting.<br>  <br>  I'm having a hard time finding pictures along the lines you're thinking, but if you do some zig-zag frosting, that could give the right feel.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helped a bit.|`|SwN8mUrwaa	that is so sweet! aww =]  <br>  <br>  i thought they stopped making those? i can't help you with the cake part but i thought this would be a good idea. <br>  <br>  if they still make them or if he likes any other type of candy bar just as much as the mars bar.. i thought this would be nice & yummy!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Deep-Fried-Mars-Bars-43463" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Deep-Fried-Mar...</a><br>  <br>  i have had a fried snickers bar at the fair and it was amazinggg!|`|AA11394457	Somebody has done this you can get the recipe and view the process here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pimpthatsnack.com/project/279/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pimpthatsnack.com/project/279...</a>

vs5rK3iRaa	Whole eggs (in a shell) do not freeze well.  The shell will invariably break and you will have shell shards embedded in your egg.  Shelled eggs freeze reasonably well, but not as well as if you separate the yolks from the whites.  Put each egg white in an ice tray compartment, and each egg yolk in a separate compartment until they are frozen.  You can then de-tray them and put them all together in a zip top bag for long term storage.  Remember to take as much air as possible out of the bag before you seal it.|`|Eb3SnljMaa	Following are some easy instructions for freezing eggs:<br>  <br>  Whole Eggs:  To freeze whole eggs or yolks crack them into a bowl and gently stir to break up the yolk somewhat. Try not to incorporate air into the eggs. Label the container with the date and the number of eggs. They can be kept frozen for a year, and should be thawed in the refrigerator the day before you intend to use them. <br>  <br>  Egg Yolks:  To inhibit yolks from getting lumpy during storage, stir in a 1/2-teaspoon salt per 1-cup of egg or yolks. If using for desserts, use 1-tablespoon sugar or corn syrup per 1-cup yolks or whole eggs. Label the container with the date and the number of egg yolks. Use up extra egg yolks in recipes like sauces, custards, ice cream, yellow cakes, mayonnaise, scrambled eggs, and cooked puddings. <br>  <br>  Egg Whites:  Raw egg whites do not suffer from freezing (cooked egg whites are very rubbery). No salt or sugar is needed. Break and separate the eggs one at a time, making sure that no yolk gets into the whites. Pour into trays and freeze until firm. Label the container with the date and the number of egg whites. Use up extra egg whites in boiled frostings (i.e., 7-minute frosting), meringue cookies, angel food cake, white cakes, or meringue for pies. <br>  <br>  Hard-Cook Egg Yolks:  Hard-cooked egg yolks can be frozen to use later for toppings or garnishes. Carefully place the yolks in a single layer in a saucepan and add enough water to come at least I inch above the yolks. Cover and quickly bring just to boiling. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, in the hot water about 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain well and package for freezing.<br>  <br>  Hard-cooked whole eggs and whites become tough and watery when frozen, so don't freeze them.<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/Eggs/FreezingEgg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/Eggs/Free...</a>

It is especially high in the phytoestrogen, isoflavone, which contains two important compounds -- genistein and daidzin. <br>  <br>  Understanding the Effects of Phytoestrogens<br>  The effects of phytoestrogens on a woman's body are not fully understood, but it is believed they compete with estrogen to fit into estrogen receptor sites in different parts of the body, including breast tissue. Because estrogen stimulates cell reproduction, it may be that the more exposure a women has to estrogen, the greater her breast cancer risk. In premenopausal women, phytoestrogens may have an estrogen-reducing effect because they attach to estrogen receptor sites, thus tricking the body into producing less estrogen. <br>  <br>  The effect of phytoestrogens is less clearly understood in postmenopausal women, whose estrogen levels are naturally lowered. Although there is some evidence to suggest consumption of soy reduces breast cancer risk in premenopausal women, there is no evidence that consumption of soy reduces postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Some doctors and nutrition experts believe phytoestrogens may actually boost estrogen levels in postmenopausal women. <br>  <br>  "Because the chemical structure of phytoestrogens is very similar to estrogen, they may be interpreted by the body and some tissues as estrogen and may be just as likely to increase the risk of breast cancer as to reduce it. And super-concentrated pharmacological doses of phytoestrogens are probably detrimental. You're playing with fire because it could go either way. It could do more harm than good," said Jeanne Petrek, MD, a surgeon and breast cancer specialist at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. <br>  <br>  Also unknown are the effects of phytoestrogens on women who already have breast cancer, women at risk for a recurrence of breast cancer, or those at risk for developing it because of genetic factors. However, it is thought that increasing isoflavonoid intake may stimulate cell growth in these cases as well, and should therefore be avoided. "If one has any risk for breast cancer, taking isoflavonoids may not be good," said Abby Bloch, PhD, RD, chair of the nutrition and physical activity advisory committee for the American Cancer Society (ACS). <br>  <br>  Trying to Find a Connection<br>  Currently, no clinical trials have shown eating specified amounts of soy products over time reduces the risk of breast cancer. Animal studies and in vitro (test tube) studies of cancer tissue point to a connection between isoflavonoids and reduced breast cancer risk, but no causal relationship has been established. <br>  <br>  "There is no clear-cut evidence on the advantages or disadvantages of increased levels of isoflavonoids in the prevention of breast cancer," said Kathryn Hamilton, MA, RD, clinical nutrition manager at Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Breast Oncology Department. "Until we figure out what kind of estrogens fuel breast cancer, no one should be self-prescribing or self-diagnosing." <br>  <br>  Although the link between diet and breast cancer is not yet clearly understood, specialists agree there are health benefits associated with consuming a diet rich in naturally occurring plant chemicals found in soy products such as tofu and in the fiber of whole grains, berries, fruits, vegetables, and flaxseed. Whether and how such a diet contributes to cancer prevention is not yet understood. Human trials are needed, particularly on the effects of isoflavonoids on girls and young women, in whom they may have the greatest impact on future health.|`|WuxC1YBJaa	Soy does not give you cancer.

0Ye3d4C3aa	i would suggest bartending at a restaurant that has a bar, rather than an actual bar. you will still be able to make great money, and your bar guests will be expected to keep it friendly. less fights, and such to deal with. and your parents will prob be more understanding of a restaurant bar. i notice you said tabc, so you are from texas, will you be in a dry county? if so you will have to deal with unicards, or some other type of membership, which is a hassel. as a bartender, expect to hear everything but act like you heard nothing. people have the most bizarre conversations in public. you will have to deal with some tough customers, but you will also have regulars who you will love, and they will help you out if theres a bar fight, because regulars tend to try to protect their bartender and their bar. hope i helped!|`|e46d2c3d2a60fbc79b6ad9ededf072abaa	Hey Kid!

It's a lot classier than the Non-Com club on base. Of course the advantage to both is you don't have to leave the base, if you have on-base housing. Officers in general, are more likely to behave (accept for the pilots, who tend to be jerks no matter what branch they serve in) and will impress your parents. It might even help your husbands career.

If it gets busy - be prepared to work your butt off. Going to a bartending school is nothing like 'real life' behind the bar. When you are in class nobody is drinking, fighting, hitting on you etc. Bartending isn't just looking cute and pouring a drink - it's never like is was in "Coyote Ugly". You have to lug cases of alchohol, beer, buckets of ice and sometimes kegs and be prepared to be met with a lot of thirsty people all at the same time.<br>  Someones suggestions of working in a 'behind the scenes' restaurant bar is a good suggestion, but if you aren't in a place with a lot of big, busy restaurants, most place don't just have a bar for dinner patrons only - or the bar staff swaps nights working in the regular bar for the back bar.<br>  I have worked some really rough joints and classy places and one thing remains the same. A mean drunk is a mean drunk no matter their walk in life. Be prepared to meet a few and if your lucky - really lucky - you will have a bouncer.<br>  Wearing a short skirt helps with the tips.<br>  I don't have any advice on what to tell your parents. I got into bartending because I liked to drink and the camaraderie. I needed to leave for the same reasons. Too much drinking and too much camaraderie.<br>  My gut tells me you won't last long in this industry - sorry. You  need to also gel with the customers and be a good listener. If you are only doing it for the money your boss and your customers will know it.|`|tIfo0GVqaa	you have to show them you are confident and know your drinks. lie even to them to get the job even if your not so sure bout something they require.cuz even if you dont know you will have to.they dont tell you tips.so you have to watch  <br>  and pick up fast.<br>  <br>  the good side is you can relax n talk with new people.free drinks and tips too :D|`|cupxeThNaa	I would dress in a casual dress attire.  Unless you are job searching in very upscale places then dress in casual business attire.  I was a bartender part time to earn extra income and I was fine.  I would suggest looking for a restaurant/bars so you are not alone in a bar at night.  Plus bars in restaurants usually close with in an hour of dining room so you will not be out until 4:00am.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	depends on the place you work for, if its upscale more than likely it will be laid back atmosphere full of the rich and broke pretending to be well off, if its a place where a lot of college kids drink expect it to crazy as hell some nights, like fights, someone passes out, screaming, yelling, guys hitting on you, well you should expect that from any bar you work at. since you've never worked as a bartender, get ready to see a whole different world of people come your way...good luck

61a706a96992f304450dbded47628ddbaa	I used to think coffee was a science, it really isn't, it is a matter of personal taste.  I also use Folgers for the same pot. I find that it is a matter of preference. I like my coffee strong, however if I am having company I lighten it some. I just practiced what I liked. I use 1/2 cup coffee to full pot. But as I said, I like the bean! Be willing to taste what you make and experiment to your taste. Once you prefect it you will be glad you did. There really is no science, it's what YOU like.<br>  <br>  Happy Drinking!!|`|CTOd9HCmaa	It really depends on your taste. Also depends on how big your cup of coffee is. In general, it is about one teaspoon of coffee per one cup. Just try this out and see if it's what you like. If not, then slowly adjust until you find what exactly you are looking for.<br>  <br>  P.S. I also find that if you use tap water, it ruins the taste. I have one of those filter jugs. Believe me, the difference is well worth it!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  MathStud|`|0R46pYb3aa	Each brewer has its own character.  Start with one heaping tablespoon per two cups and then adjust from there.  Also, if your water is chlorinated think about a water filter that removes the chlorine, the same for very hard water.  Bottled water is another option.  Remember that brewed coffee is predominately water, so the water you use can make a huge difference.|`|lLPIs7WFaa	clean, good water is essential.  No point even making coffee without it.  Folgers original.    You can do better.  If you get grocery store coffee go with Yuban.  If your store has beans and a grinder try a french roast.  Remember that a coffee cup is 6 fluid ounces, not 8.  A good starter ratio is one rounded tablespoon of ground coffee per cup .  Thats a 6 oz cup remember.  You can adjust as you go.  I like mine strong so I go with a heaping tbsp/cup.  It really helps if you can find a good Indie coffee shop with a knowledgeable barista to talk to.  I also use one of those washable gold plated filters.  The paper filters absorb the essential oils from the coffee and dont let them go into the pot.  This leaves something missing from your cup.  The plastic filter doesnt hold the oils and gives you a really good cup.<br>     It doesnt hurt to read up on it.  And if you can get your hands on the episode of Good Eats where Alton Brown makes coffee that is worth a watch too.<br>  Lets review.   Good water. Good coffee grounds.  A good filter and 1 rounded tbsp per cup.  Should get you started.
88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	The Whole Jar of Peanut Butter Cookies<br>   <br>   <br>  This is from AllRecipes.com. Very good. You can cut down on the white sugar and they are even better.<br>  <br>  The Whole Jar of Peanut Butter Cookies<br>  Servings: 30<br>  "This cookie got its name because a whole 18-ounce jar of peanut butter is used to make it. It is the creamiest, moistest cookie I have ever had, and bound to be a favorite with anyone who makes them. Just don't over bake them!"<br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 cup butter, softened<br>  1 cup white sugar<br>  1 cup packed brown sugar<br>  2 eggs<br>  1 egg yolk<br>  2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>   <br>  1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter<br>  2 cups all-purpose flour<br>  1 teaspoon baking soda<br>  1/2 teaspoon salt<br>  1 cup chopped peanuts<br>  Directions:<br>  1.  In a large bowl, cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, yolks, and vanilla; mix until fluffy. Stir in peanut butter. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Finally, stir in the peanuts. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours.<br>  2.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.<br>  3.  Roll dough into walnut sized balls. Place on the prepared cookie sheet and flatten slightly with a fork. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should look dry on top. Allow to cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to cool completely on a rack.

Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the ginger and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onions and chop them into tiny pieces.<br>  <br>  Put the oil into a saucepan on a moderate heat. Put the garlic, ginger, meat and onions into the pan. Cook for 20 minutes until the meat is cooked thoroughly. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. <br>  <br>  Open the tin of tomatoes. Pour the juice into a bowl. Chop the tomatoes while they are still in the can (it’s easier than chasing them around the bowl). Put the chopped tomatoes into the bowl. Use half and save the other half. <br>  <br>  Put the chopped tomatoes into the pan. Continue to cook, stirring as the mixture boils. Add the chilli, garam masala and turmeric, and stir. Add the water. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Put the lid on the saucepan and cook for 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS<br>  <br>  The quantity of chilli powder above makes for a medium curry. For a hot one, increase this to 1? teaspoons.<br>  <br>  For a mild one, add 100ml (? a 200ml pot) of yoghurt 5 to 10 minutes before the end of cooking. For a mild Chicken Korma, also add a 50g sachet of creamed coconut. Add ? a teaspoon of mint sauce to the leftover yoghurt to make some mint raita. <br>  <br>  * Plum tomatoes can be used either whole or chopped. It is difficult to stick chopped tomatoes back together again if you need to use them whole.
SRqIIuwOaa	1) Carrots can cut the risk of cancer by stimulating the bodies cancer-fighting mechanisms. 2) they can cut the risk of heart disease 3) they can protect your lungs and help them perform better 4) they are good for your eyes<br>  <br>  But... large doses of carrots is not good. Too much vitamin A can be toxic, even leading to death in a few cases. Also your skin can turn yellow or orange a skin condition called carotenemia.<br>  <br>  At the rate you eating them you probably wont have any issues but make sure your not taking any vitamins with additional amounts of vitamin A because you can run into a problem. But personally I would only eat a suggested serving size a day because when in comes to diets moderation is key and you can have too much of a good thing. Besides if your eating too mcuh of carrots you could be missing out on other vegies with other nutriets. <br>  <br>  "A carrot a day, wil keep th doctor away"|`|x3RAaLfNaa	You won't turn orange.

There are a few other newer establishments but these 2 have been around a long time and their experience shows in the quality. Besides fish n' chips, with a wide variety of fish to choose from, there are also lots of other seafood choices on the menu.

Even though the cans are no longer made of tin, the solders that attach the lid or seams are.|`|MwkR695Gaa	it was probabaly mold. If you really want pineapple i would buy the fresh kind. you can either buy a whole one and cut it urself (it takes along time and u have to make sure to get the hard middle and the little black things off. its also hard to figure out weather the pineapples good or not.) or you could go to the produce section and get one already cut. at my store they have it all pre cut and put into a plastic container. anything thats not from a can is good. the caning process is kind of like asking someone to eat apple pie and then taking away all filling before they eat it.|`|AAGOEnD3aa	Don't worry, just dint eat anymore. the black stuff you saw is the inside of the tin/metal can reacting to being exposed to air.  It's called oxidation. It happens even faster when acid is involved such as oranges, pineapple, etc.  I always transfer my canned fruit to a plastic container.  This is the same thing that happens when you bite into an apple, notice that if you let it set for a while, it will began to turn brown...this oxidation taking place.  When you see metal rusting..example bridges, cars etc.  This is oxidation taking place because the metal is exposed to the open air.  This is why cars are rust proofed, and the steel industry has to have some sort of coating for metals because they will react to air by rusting.

aMHIA7XMaa	Tea pots are usually used when more than 1 cup of tea needs to be made. You heat the water in the kettle and then pour it into the tea pot (heating the water in the tea pot will break it if it's ceramic). You put your teabag in the pot, not in the kettle. If you put the teabag in the kettle while the water is heating up your tea will be intolerably strong.|`|vDSRgHxDaa	I'm in the UK, we are all about drinking tea here but honestly we don't use tea pots anymore (most of us).

Ah, well, interestingly enough I know this one and I'm an American.<br>  <br>  A tea kettle is a device used to boil water. Some can be placed on the stove top to boil. Some will whistle when they reach boiling. Others are electric. In all cases of tea kettles, the point is to bring the water up to boiling, not for making tea in.<br>  <br>  A tea pot is generally a porcelain, clay, or metal pot that is designed to brew tea in. Because of the materials they are generally made up of, they are typically not placed on heat sources to bring the water up to boiling.<br>  <br>  The point to brewing tea in a pot is to keep the tea from actually burning. A burnt tea will be bitter. Tea pots generally hold a large quantity of water, You can find one cup pots but I find those to be mostly decorative. A typical tea pot will hold 4 cups of liquid. Larger tea services can possibly hold 6-10 cups. And then there are tea urns (also know as samovars) which can hold about 20 cups of liquid.|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	One point is that a teapot makes enough tea for more than one person all at once. It steeps the tea by the moisture rising, condensing on the top and dripping back into the pot so it enhances the flavor.<br>  A kettle brings the water to a boil but then it needs to cool to below boiling to be best for tea. Pouring from one place to another does help it cool a tad.<br>  <br>  It does look very nice in a beautiful pot. Presentation is important to some.<br>  :)|`|l4CnxvdRaa	People use teapots to hold the more than one serving of tea.  You can do any of methods you mentioned -- boil the water and pour it directly into your mug with a tea bag or a diffuser, or microwave it -- or you can pour the water into a teapot with the leaves or teabags and let it sit in there.  Then you pour the tea into your mug.  I suppose you wouldn't need a teapot if you are drinking alone and you don't mind pouring the water straight into your mug from the kettle or microwaving it, but it comes in handy if you're drinking tea in another room or something.  You often see people carrying trays with a teapot and teacups (with cream, sugar, and other stuff to add).  It kinda saves you the trouble of reheating water in a cup in the microwave or going back to the kettle to get more water.<br>  <br>  Basically, it's just something to hold your tea in; whether or not you get one depends on your needs.|`|6bc64ef904b85435ca22447049fc65b3aa	Firstly,the tea pot is specially used when several people drinking tea together.<br>  Secondly,apart from the culture things,some pots are really magically good for both the taste and the nutrition.<br>  Thirdly,sipping a little cup of tea is not just because you're thirsty,so the atmosphere is rather important,serving the tea using such a well-decorated teapot--so even antiques--is really enjoyable.|`|AA11796308	Many people just make tea in the mug but I do think tea from a pot tastes better. Possibly because the teas has more room to brew or perhaps that you tend to leave it longer to brew.<br>  <br>  What you MUST do thos is warm the pot first with hot water which you poor out just before making the tea.<br>  <br>  Many people never wash their tea pot (just rinse it)...you then get a nice coating of tannin built up which many say will add to the favour.|`|n5DlXdsCaa	The tea pots are just for fancy little parties. They're not always used. The tea is put in them after it's steeped, carried to the table, and poured from there to the glasses. English culture is actually pretty similar to American, I'm American and have been a couple of places that have used teapots.|`|8577a176f9acd96c98f2643c04d60c01aa	I believe it is mostly for decoration. <br>  <br>  If you have a few people over and you are making tea, it just looks nice and presentable to have a tea pot full of it, rather than having to individually make and refill cups.|`|4LJnBX3laa	I put the heated water in the tea pot, and the tea leaves in my cup. I suppose the pot's just for decoration.|`|TXGYzcWSaa	tea is much more healthy  than coffee!!!<br>  <br>  but both mess up th tooth!|`|48059b1217c0db411cd0097366164c61aa	If you look back in history you find the answer to most things and I guess the teapot was a new innovation at some point in time, as was the cup.....at one time it was fashionable to drink from the saucer rather than the bowl.<br>  We've moved on a pace since then and although teapots are still used when several people are going to drink tea at the same time or if one is going to use loose leaf tea, on the whole most folk put a bag in a cup and pour the boiling water over and add the milk (if so desired) after the bag has been removed from the cup.<br>  Microwaved water is appalling and ruins the flavour of any decent tea !|`|OzK10hKxaa	lol,<br>  <br>  Well, using 1 tea bag for 1 cup of tea is a bit of a waste?<br>  <br>  Usually, if you are with family, you would boil the kettle, put about 2-3 tea bags in the tea pot, and then put the boiled kettle water in the tea pot. <br>  <br>  Then you'll probably get like 5-6 cups of tea out of it. <br>  If you've finished your drink, you can re-fill it with the tea from the tea pot.<br>  <br>  Rather than, go back in the kitchen, put another tea bag in your cup and boil the kettle again.<br>  <br>  Get it? ;-D <br>  <br>  In theory you could put the tea bags in the kettle, but it's likely to stain it. And if you want just some water, you'll have to empty the tea bags out and start all over, it's a mess about. <br>  <br>  A lot of people do just put a tea bag in a cup/mug though and do it that way.|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	People all over the world drink tea, and I'm sure it's the same everywhere.  When I was in Japan at the ryokan, or place we were staying, we got hot water from a big coffee urn and put it in small ceramic pots but microwaves exist all over the place.  Just depends on the person I guess and how they feel like preparing it.  It tastes good, so however is fine with me.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	Tea used to be prohibitively expensive, and was only available loose.  By making it in a pot you use much less tea per cup, and it is a lot easier (and less messy) than trying to make multiple cups with loose leaves.  As tea became cheaper and more popular it was considered common to make tea in the mug so teapots stayed around.  Nowadays no-one cares anymore so teapots are - for the most part - obsolete.<br>  <br>  NB.  Coffee pots exist too, for exactly the same reason.

You mean you never drank hard liquor before.<br>  <br>  Well, in that case you will hate it.  No way you would possibly enjoy the hard liquor straight from a bottle.  <br>  <br>  Liquor is actually limited.  There's only a handful:<br>  Whisky - probably the one you most commonly drink straight<br>  Vodka - pretty bad out of the bottle, best when mixed<br>  Rum - never drink this straight, always mix it<br>  Tequila - also drank straight a lot, cheap ones are extra bad tasting<br>  Gin - you'd be an absolute moron to drink this out of the bottle<br>  Brandy - rarely drank from a bottle, but pretty good without a mixer<br>  Schnapps - always flavored, bearable; cheap ones aren't great<br>  <br>  Everything else you see is actually a liqueur.  These are lower in alcohol and have extra sugar added.  Examples are Jagermeister, Hypnotiq, Amaretto, Kahlua, Bailey's, Aftershock, Galliano, Chambord, Sloe Gin, etc.  Many of these are easily drinkable straight (jager, hypnotiq probably being the most drinkable).  But they are lower in alcohol -- Hypnotiq is only 17%ABV whereas Jager is 35%ABV and most liquor is atleast 40%ABV.<br>  <br>  Since you never drank hard liquor before, I'm tempted to say go with a liqueur like Jager -- many people drink that.  But... Schnapps might not be a bad idea either.  If you go with whisky, it has to be atleast $25, though.  Schnapps is much cheaper and since its flavored will taste a bit better.  Flavored vodka is not a great idea, none of them taste any good.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	If you aren't pouring it out of the bottle, you can get way more drunk than you mean to... as in alcohol posioning. Wost ever, not fun, possibly deadly.<br>  <br>  If you seriously want to sip from the bottle don't buy anything higher than 30 poof. Its still "fun" but less likely to make people sick.<br>  <br>  Most of the schnapps drinks are safer than rum, vodka, gin, whiskey etc. Plus if you get something funky you can dare people to drink it, kinda fun to watch their faces.<br>  <br>  A place in Wisconsin sells Wasabe flavored schnapps I've never had it but that definitly sounds like a "dare" drink.<br>  <br>  If you want to make if a little classier try GoldSchlagger. Looks cool/ rich but your less likely to drink till you puke.|`|I7mBG3Dnaa	Whatever you do, do not buy Evan Williams. It is disgusting. <br>  Try Cruzann Rum, flavored Bacardi, or Three Olives Vodka.

Maybe this is just me, but all the guys I know love Jager (while most girls find it disgusting).|`|1e3e79f5d2afacec16e368695a7510d5aa	get some Hypnotic!! And save the bottle for memories. XD|`|jsUE73TXaa	You can get really wasted off of mixed drinks, too.  Mixing rum and vodka with coke, cool-aid, or orange juice works great.  If you want to go with tequila, you can do margaritas.  Or you can do whiskey and coke.  If you want to go with whiskey, I would recommend Crown Royal.  It's a little more expensive but definitely high quality.<br>  <br>  If you want to drink straight out of the bottle but haven't done it before, then you should go with a liquer like Tuaca, Jagermeister, or Disaronno.  They're more syrupy - more sugar - and have just a little bit less alcohol than liquor.  But it's less bang for your buck.|`|zBB2AFMbaa	popov--disgusting but very cheap|`|yid0jeX4aa	vodka!!!!|`|ahOk4C0saa	listen to pete|`|lzOMqj3baa	wild turkey  american honey|`|OW9CxGyVaa	Jack Daniell's all the way to the bank!|`|2dpPZx17aa	jack|`|uUntSv20aa	hen,patron,or jack

If you are making the white cake you will likely blend the cake mix with water, oil and 3 eggs. Pour the batter into a greased 9 x 13-inch baking pan and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes. When cake is done, let it cool to room temperature.<br>  <br>  When the cake has cooled, slice it in half and place each half on a wax-paper covered cookie sheet, or a platter or tray that will fit into your freezer.<br>  <br>  Use a sharp serrated knife (a bread knife works great) to slice the ice cream through the middle, box and all, so that you have two 2-inch thick sheets of ice cream. Peel the cardboard off the ice cream and lay a half upon each of cakes. Slice the edges of the cake all the way around so that the cake is the same size as the ice cream on top. Work quickly so that the ice cream doesn't melt. When both cake have been trimmed, place them into the freezer for an hour or two.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to frost the cake, take the two pints (4 cups) of vanilla ice cream out of the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to soften. Stir the ice cream so that it is smooth, like frosting. Use a frosting knife or spatula to coat each cake with about 2 cups of ice cream. Cover the entire surface thoroughly so that you cannot see any of the cake. Pop the cakes into the freezer for an hour or so to set up.<br>  <br>  When the cakes have set, fill a pastry bag (with a fancy tip) with white frosting to decorate all around the top edge of the cake. Also decorate around the bottom of the cake. Use colored frosting and different tips to add inspired artistic flair and writing on the cake, as needed. Cover the cakes and keep them in your freezer until party time.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to serve the cakes, leave them out for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Cut the cakes with a sharp knife that has been held under hot water.<br>  <br>  Makes 2 cakes (approximately 10 servings each).<br>  <br>  Preparation Tips: You may wish to use another flavor cake mix such as chocolate or devil's food for this dessert, even low-fat cake mix works. It's up to you. Just follow the directions on the box for making the cake in a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. You can also use any flavor of ice cream.

F08HDRvraa	one bottle of beer has about the same alcohol percentage as a shot of hard liquor.  Excessive consumption of alcohol can contribute to high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease (alcohol is toxic to the heart).|`|21g5bHfvaa	Theres usually around 3-5% alcohol: it has to be below 5% in most places if they don't want to put how much alcohol is in it.  It isn't uncommon for beer to have 2% or as high as 11%.  It can cause high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, stroke, etc.  Some alcohol is good for you though so enjoy.

DFshzoJkaa	Parmesan, especially Reggiano, is expensive cus its high quality imported cheese.  Its not like Velveeta, where the more you buy, the more you save.  $8 is considered a very good price ($12 is the average). so, i doubt you'll ever find REAL parmesan for $4. (maybe a parmesan/romano "blend").  However, i would try to find an italian market near you or, simply go to your local grocer and speak to the manager.  tell them you want to buy a big wheel.  maybe they'll help you out on the price.  i could refer you upscale italian websites, but none sell anything for $4 a pound and you would have to pay for shipping, which would definitely be expensive for a big heavy wheel.

Brown hamburger, drain grease, add spag. sauce & tomato paste, when using tomato paste, I always add a pinch of sugar because it makes it slightly bitter...mix it well and let it simmer.
