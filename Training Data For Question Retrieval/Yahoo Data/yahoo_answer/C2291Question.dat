Well I dont really know how to U.S education system works, because I am a Canadian student. Right now I am planning on applying to a business school, and I am seeing what options there are in U.S.       A little background:       My marks in Grade 12 is basically:      Calculus 93% (repeated), Business 93%, Accounting 93%, English 86%, Geography 91%, World Issues 90%, Chemistry 60%, and Data Management 70%.       I have done some extra curricular stuff, such as played Rugby and Football in my junior years, and played hockey in my senior year. Also I am a part of two clubs (one of which i am a VP) in the school.       Also in case it matters, my grade 11 average was 80%.       I am wanting to know how do the universities in the US look at repeated courses in high schools (do they take the higher mark, or an average of the two marks). Which university in the U.S. would be good for me to apply, considering the marks I have.       In Canada, the universities here take usually the top 6 marks in gr.12..Is US similar?

Well, I'm in a community college, trying to complete my core curriculum, and transfer to a 4 year institution and get my Bachelor's degree...  But i've been thinking about a shorter less stressful degree like an Associate's degree...  I've been on that community college for more than 3 years now, and i barely have completed 7 or 8 classes from the core curriculum. I feel like I've been left behind...   I see All my friends with their bachelor's degrees, driving their new cars, with good jobs, and their life together...  I have realized that i'm not that smart and responsable to accomplish all that great stuff.  So, If I ever earn an Associate's Degree(of any kind), do I still have a chance to have a decent job and at least be able to pay the rent?  Please help.,.. thanks.
