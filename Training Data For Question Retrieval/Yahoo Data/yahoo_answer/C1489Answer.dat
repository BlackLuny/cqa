8OXVSoe0aa	I had my suspicions in 4th grade when we went to see the movie hoot. Cody Linley was sooo hot. lol But i thought that all guys felt that way. So I didn't really ask myself if I was until I was 12|`|lJesjw83aa	I always knew I was different than other guys...didn't figure out why until around 7th grade|`|cbY6NoHSaa	In 8th grade I started having feeling for a girl and I didn't know why. Then I realized there was a name for it.|`|D1KT9ioJaa	ppl that are gay where born gay....|`|DDol2J8maa	My first crush was on a girl, I was about 4 or 5 yrs old, then in elementary school it was pounded into my head that I should like boys and I tried for a while. But then I remember that around 2nd grade I found my uncle's playboy magazines and I was so aroused! I finally accepted that I was lesbian when I fell so hard in love with a woman coworker that I could not deny it anymore! So I guess you always know but you are raised to be a heterosexual until you are of a conscious age and can either agree with it or not.|`|tdJuvdeXaa	Well I don't think I am lesbian...but hey I'm not done with puberty yet so I may turn out to be lesbian. Sorry can't offer my story. But Beckham you're missing the point. Regardless of whether gay people are born gay (which is arguable) most gay people have to eventually realize it. Some just grow up knowing, but not most.|`|jzMM8imyaa	Well, I always knew I was different, but I couldn't place it. I didn't ever really admit that I found men attractive until 8th grade-ish. But even then I didn't ever admit to myself being gay until midway through my freshman year of high school.|`|9HeQd7cNaa	i get in trouble for watching reality t.v. shows yet im allowed to watch south park|`|ig6qg2R4aa	I realized it when I was in 5th grade, I don't know how old I was, you can do the math.<br>  <br>  I had my first crush when I was 5 (on a girl)|`|FJPKtZN5aa	well i have always kinda known but you could say at 11/12 i knew what what it was
AA10091424	If you must do this, do it after the concert.  Make it gentle and light, and don't force yourself upon him.<br>  <br>  Tell him how wonderful he is, and why you think so.
GPznIhzMaa	I went through something similar when I was younger. All of my boyfriends were non-Asian and it took a while for my parents to grasp that I wasn't doing it out of rebellion. My parents would act rude to my boyfriends and tried to end our relationships. After a few more years and a few more non-Asian boyfriends later, my parents finally saw that what mattered most was that they treated me well. My current boyfriend of 1-1/2 years is Honduran and my parents have even told me he's their favorite so far.<br>  <br>  It's not easy, but if you really believe in your relationship and if you want to change your parents' beliefs, you have to stand your ground. Apply to whichever schools you want and apply for scholarships. A lot of people put themselves through school (I did). You'll come out the better for it by not taking the easy road.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	I was in your situation once.  I left home, worked my way through college and made my own way in the world.  It was hard, but not as hard as having my dad's views shoved down my throat.  I left and told dad if he couldn't accept me or my choices, I was sorry and would always love him, but, he had to accept me or I would not be in his life.  I am a very happy person and would do the same thing today.  It took dad awhile to come around, but, he did.|`|dn7pISSuaa	Ignore your dad.|`|3hYUNHphaa	Oh my goodness, this is going to sound so freaky, but i know a white girl named Cara, whose last name starts with an m, and she's dating a black guy in college, as well! She has even been looking into going to his college, but her daddy won't let her! (Twilight Zone, muchh?)<br>  <br>  ANYWAYS, enough of that, this is really sad. But as sad as it is, depending on how old you are, and how much you need your parents, you need to consider this before you break their rules.<br>  <br>  They will always be your parents, and even though your heart is in the right place, you may be considering a battle with them that doesn't end even if you break up with this guy.<br>  <br>  You also have to consider if your dad thinks you are doing this just to piss him off, for shock value, or similar reasons of USING the guy to get a jab at your folks. If your relationships with your parents are strained, or if you have ever done this with any guy, he has some right to be offended by your choices...(not because the guy is black but because you have been disrespectful to your dad).<br>  <br>  If you want to pursue it, you may consider introducing him to your family as a friend, and keep your relationship with him at that level for a while, waiting for a softening of everyone's attitude. There is a chance, as there always is with racism, that meeting someone as an individual in a non-threatening way, may soften their hearts a little. It may be that even if they don't like all black people, they may learn to like this guy. (If it gets more serious, they may change their minds...or the guy will find it increasingly hard to be around knowing he is a racist).They probably will always be at least a little uncomfortable with the possibility that you would date him.<br>  <br>  Even after you are on your own and can make your own choices, you still have to consider these things, no matter how YOU personally feel about interracial dating and marriage. If your dad is a softie at heart, and if you approach it right, you may be able to win him over on the idea that this guy is your boyfriend. But probably not to the extent that everyone would be comfortable with the situation. You would have to think about the guy. How much of that would you want to expose him to? <br>  <br>  But, again, friendships and individual relationships are what have brought us this far in our understanding of each other so I would say it is not completely out of the question to see this guy.|`|9okusH1kaa	Well, your dad has a point as the majority of interracial marriages are unhappy after the initial period of marital bliss. Also, many black men try to objectify white women as part of their subculture (i.e. get them pregnant and leave). <br>  <br>  However, your case is your case and you and your boyfriend may be different than the unhappy interracial couples and he doesn't sound like he is objectifying you. Try to make your dad see this. <br>  <br>  However, you should remember that your dad is your family and will be there for you always. Your boyfriend is just some guy and you are very young and inexperienced. Try not to alienate your father over this issue as he is a far more important person in your life than your boyfriend is. <br>  <br>  Also, marriage? You're in high school, you shouldn't think about marriage until you finish college at least. Couple that marry young almost always wind up unhappy and getting divorced. <br>  <br>  I know you're going to rate my answer low, but thats just my 2 cents.|`|C7o9XMaZaa	I went through the same exact thing, and I'm 39 yrs old now. First, you must realize that you can't change your dad's belief system. As a teenager it was very hard for me because I almost worshiped the ground my father walked on. But I realized that father's can be wrong too. He believes that way because he was taught to believe like that. I just kept doing what I believed was right in my heart. Be thankful tHAT YOUR DAD IS TALKING TO YOU. He may never bless your wedding but will that stop you from marrying the man that makes you happy? I hope not.
RWgjnwl9aa	Avoid these 2 idiots like the plague don't get in touch with that stupid dad of his b/c this mess will continue the so called popular boys' are jerks too don't let this crap get the better of you OK|`|GqfiRXu3aa	I think you should seek the advice of your guidance counselor.  This rumor has gone on long enough.  The guidance counselor can get all parties together and work this out and tell these people to stop this nonsense once and for all!<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Don't have contact with the father.  It's not normal for a grown man to have hour-long telephone conversations with teenaged girls.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	cut off contact and go straight to the school principal. <br>  you have the right to feel welcome and safe at school and if you don't that is the school's problem.<br>  Sometimes people just won't stop. Tell him that if this does not end today then you are going to the school. <br>  Let your parents know whats going on|`|WL1Tmx8Eaa	quote:<br>  "Your son has been harrasing me for quite some time now and you haven't helped, if it doesn't stop i will turn to other sources, thank you for your help, (you don't want to sound rude) <br>  (name here)"<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :) Good luck :)|`|3rv5mjfeaa	Get over it. Seriously, fight your own fights jackass. Why do you need to text him? And are you seriously considering going to your guidance counselor? They are there to pick out classes not help you dammit.|`|101bfea0cfc2e9bab98441d37836406eaa	"He started an extremely nasty rumor about me that his girlfriend (a supposed friend) told him."<br>  <br>  Seems to me that it is this supposed friend who should be fixing things.|`|ftKEfkWqaa	Text message?  You have to get even.  What would be an insulting rumor about this guy?  You may want to come up with something good.  Take your time.  Maybe he is hostile because his mom didn't even want to be around him.|`|YiUQacWRaa	Just ignore it if its not true dont worry just stick up for your self by not letting it bother you its what they want they wanna see you get upset this just shows who your true friends are so just keep movin along|`|eus7WqzUaa	LOL! I wouldn't say he is gay.  I would say that you are going to get a restraining order on him and his son if it doesn't stop.|`|BuP1JlIxaa	three words<br>  He Is Gay|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You need to stop keeping the drama going and you should never have started with the man or his son on the phone, go to someone in authority and have them deal with it and you have no more communication with either the jerk or his jerky father.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	It is best to stay away from both this boy and his father, they are obviously playing you and your girlfriend and have no regard for women. Just stay away. Don;t make this more than what it is...Such people end up creating their own problems and it is just a matter of time until he finds a new victim to make up a vicious rumor about. He will dig his own grave, trust me. <br>  At highschool rumor come and rumors go, just laugh, make it into a joke and don't get flustered. Stay away from the jerks their are always a few, and some of them are single fathers who lack attention.
AGlpdpAKaa	by going behind his back, you are still letting him control you, because by not telling him you're acting as if you're doing somethign wrong, which you're not.  he's being controlling, it's a double standard, and you should tell him to get over it and grow up.  don't belittle yourself and go behind his back.  it looks shitty on you, like you think that you're doing something wrong.  plus it's dishonest, and that IS doing somethign wrong.  lying is never the answer.  just do waht you want, be honest about it, and tell your boyfriend to take a hike if he wants to control how you live your life.  or else tell him that he can't do the nude modelling either, and see how he likes it.  i bet if you said no he wouldnt' listen to you, he'd do it anyways.  so why would you not do soemthing on his account?|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Follow your own instincts.  If it feels right and resonates with you, do the nude photo shoot.<br>  <br>  If not, don't.<br>  <br>  But certainly don't let ANYONE tell you what to do, especially a hypocrite.<br>  <br>  He sounds extremely controlling, btw.|`|4af7b1e055fcc07f742201869b6bf138aa	Nude modeling will probably mean more work for you. The whole point of modeling is to be seen. It's up to you if you want to go nude or not. You don't need permission.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	He's afraid the guy photographers will hit on you.  What kinds of pictures are these, anyway?  Nude modeling doesn't sound very legit, so maybe you should reconsider.|`|1iHfOeNiaa	just have a mature conversation with him about it, hes probably just really over protective and doesnt want any one to see his gf naked. If you really want to do it then go ahead its ur choice.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Posing nude will do nothing for your career.  If he isn't worried about his, it's his choice.  Fashion modeling is totally different than nude shots.  They aren't even in the same class.  This isn't about him being controlling.  This should be about your own basic self respect and having a higher standard for yourself.  Your body and where it is displayed and exposed is a big deal.  Whatever you plan to do after modeling, nude photos will follow you everywhere, not the fashion shots.  Instead of making this about him and some control issuel, make it about yourself and where you see yourself in the future.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	If you do nude modeling you are inviting men to commit adultery with you in their hearts.<br>  <br>  Do you really want to be like that?<br>  <br>  Have a little modesty.<br>  <br>  "I am just really confused on why he wont let me do this..."<br>  <br>  Hello?  He's a guy and he knows how guys think.<br>  <br>  Too bad he's too dull to see it for himself too.
mOWyzwubaa	Witr is innovation and not salat|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Ayesha has gone nuts.<br>  <br>  If one has not memorized Dua E Qunoot then he may say :<br>  <br>  Rabana Atina Fid Dunya Hasana Wa Fil Akhirati Hasana WaQina Azaban Nar.<br>  <br>  If you have not memorized the above dua then you may say Ya Rabbi 3 times..{Bahishti Zewar; Part II page 120-121) ]<br>  <br>  I am assuming you know how to perform the witr. Meaning after the 3rd's surah you say Allahu Akbar and Raise hands and fold them and then say the Dua E Qunoot or the above mentioned if you have not memorized it then go in ruku and finish your salat as normal. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  SubhanAllah about the Quran you have. <br>  <br>  But I dont know the cloth thing you said.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Are you a new Muslim or a born again? In either case I welcome you.<br>  <br>  I remember I did not memorize  duae qunoot for many months, probably over a year. I used to pray  this, instead:<br>  <br>     " Rabbana Aatina fidduniya hasnatin, wa fil aakhertin hasnatin,<br>       waqena azabunnar. "<br>  <br>  I think you can do the same till you memorize qunoot. It is the spirit, not the form, which is important.<br>  <br>                                                        Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Wa alaikum salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.Usually we make sunnah salat after isa before going to sleep as following the habit of Muhammad pbuh for about 11 raka'ats including witr of 3 raka'ats<br>  There is only 1 witr in a day and night as the closing of our ibadah.<br>  If you forget the du'a in the witr you can replace with the welknown and good du'a which is easy to be learnt e.g robana atina fidunya khasanah wa fil akhiroti khasanah waqina azab banar.(we hope Allah will give us kindness and goodness on this earth and in the after life in jannah/heaven and we will be avoided from the hell's fire).WE hope that your prayer will be accepted by Allah because you have tried of the bast and you niyat is very good. Allah knows everything including in your heart.<br>  You keep your glorious Qur'an on the glasses is ok but the most impor<br>  tant you must read the Qur'an everyday because it is not just only as a decoration.If we do not recite  the Qur'an,your house  is just like a grave.|`|qrQVW772aa	Peace @ Ayesha Pff how low can you get??? Thats pathetic... May God lighten your minds and heart dear.<br>  <br>  Wa alaykumsalam brother<br>  <br>  May Allah accept your struggles to implement Islam in your daily life. There is no doubt that this can be a rocky path at times, but if you are sincere and realize that Allah alone is the giver of success, then in shaa’Allah (God willing) He will help you, strengthen you, and use you to strengthen others. <br>  <br>  If you are doing all that is in your power to learn how to pray correctly, Allah will help you and teach you the noblest of all forms of knowledge. <br>  It is understandable that it is rather difficult for those who do not speak Arabic to say all of the Salah in Arabic. But since Islam is flexible, the new Muslim can go about learning it in a gradual way. S/He can first start saying some tasbihs (formulas of glorification of Allah) such as the words of subhana Allah, al-hamdu lillah, la ilaha illla Allaha, etc.), followed by memorizing surat al-Fatihah, and later on the last short surahs of the Qur’an (surahs 112, 113, 114). All of this, in sha’ Allah (Allah willing), should be fairly easy for him/her with Allah’s help and with a bit of help from fellow Muslims<br>  <br>  Peace to All <br>  <br>  Asalamu'alaykum

The rest you listed are tortuous and not permissible.

Are you religious? <br>  All these questions you should ask him and himself. I have seen many cases where children take Religion and Historical Biblical tales to an extent where it becomes their reality. Your son's "victims" may actually pertain to himself. <br>  If your son does not open up to you about this [and even if he does] I highly recommend you take him to a Psychologist.

Yes, suicide I guess would be unforgivible, but the major unforgivable sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  There would be loads of people in hell, because although they commit forgivable sings they don't ask for forgiveness.<br>  <br>  My guess is that there's got to be something that happens to people who commit suicide, because I don't think that God would punish someone for eternity for commiting suicide.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Suicide is not the unforgiveable sin.

No-where in the Bible does it say that suicide is an unforgivable sin.<br>  <br>  The idea comes from the Catholic Church who believe that suicide is a Mortal Sin and therefore because the person dies in Mortal Sin, they cannot go to heaven.   But that is just the Catholics.<br>  <br>  The only unforgivable sin is considered to be blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.|`|UKPQN0UKaa	I am so, so sorry you have lost loved ones to suicide. I have too... A church I went to once told us (when I was about 13) that our friend who had committed suicide was probably in hell.<br>  <br>  I hate this idea too. I'm not a Christian anymore, but I'm so with you on this. If there IS a God, only He can judge and only He knows who gets into heaven and who doesn't.

If the person is meant to live, then God would intervene in some manner - whether the method itself didn't work, someone finds them in time to get them help, etc. If the person in question is successful and dies, then, it could mean that it was his or her time to go. Which, if you think of it as part of God's plan, means that he or she could very well end up in Heaven.|`|XBwLjq1daa	Suicide isn't the unforgivable sin...although you cant come back and ask for forgiveness after that, but the unforgiveable sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit<br>  <br>  and people, why are you making it seem like people who kill themselves go to Heaven...because they don't. It counts as murder, but of yourself.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	No where in the bible does it say that suicide is unforgivable.  I happen to think that it;s selfish and that those in Christ would not do it.  It used to be pretty clear cut for me that there would be no way to repent for taking one's life.  I don't think it's so black and white anymore.. true they are playing God in the sense that they are deciding when to die, they are killing which we are not to do....Then there are those that believe in eternal salvation meaning that once you are saved you are set.   That when Christ died for all the sins it means just that.  Once you have accepted Him you have been not only washed clean from past sins but from all.  I have to say yes to the first part but happen to think you still need to repent daily as Christ says to take up our cross and follow Him,  meaning die to ourselves daily.  The perseverance of the saints, if we were forgiven for past present and future without needing to ask why would the saints need to persevere?   <br>  <br>  There is scripture to support both cases actually, and in the case of your friend like others the truth is that we don't know beyond a doubt which is true.  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss.  <br>  <br>  Blessings|`|DVEaRenTaa	I don't think it is unforgivable, but it is "a little cowardly to not live and face your problems" (a friend had issues with suicide and almost went through with it.

Perhaps it's not so much the belief of where your loved one is that is troubling you as much as your belief in your religious institution.|`|HUkPtLR2aa	Suicide is a sin just like any other sin.  All sin in deed and thought condemns the  unbeliever to hell - eternal separation from God.  The reason we consider suicide so bad is that it terminates a persons opportunity to trust and obey God.<br>  We are saved by grace through faith, not of works lest any man should boast.  ( All boasting is sin ).   If your relative trusted in Jesus he would be saved.  Jesus is our savior.|`|zFhhgL0Oaa	god is all love, god is all forgiving if asked. jesus also dies for his sins. it bothers me when human holy people judge other people and act like they have a  say where the soul goes of someone else, god will judge them for saying that god isnt forgiving even in suicide. how dare they. i have lost a loved one as well by suicide and our family is very religous and it never entered our mind that god didnt welcome him with open arms|`|L81GyNmjaa	Go to this site <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/cl/2008/001/5.18.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianitytoday.com/cl/2008...</a><br>  <br>  There is no definite answer, I don't think.

All sins are forgivable by God and even by human beings if we stop being so hardhearted all the time. Blaspheming the Holy Spirit is unforgivable, but this is a vague term which I will try to explain in a second.<br>  <br>  "There are ONLY pagans and people who committed suicide in hell, right?"<br>  <br>  -Different groups have different ideas on this matter. The only thing that can be said for sure is that people might go there after the last judgment and Christ harrowed the gates of hell setting free the captives there after He died on the cross. Also, there is no reason that a Christian, Jew, Muslim et al non-pagans couldn't go to hell.<br>  <br>  "I am a Christian, and I have lost loved one through suicide, and I do not believe one bit that people who committed suicide go to hell."<br>  <br>  -My condolences for your loss. May God grant this person mercy and receive them into paradise. Lord have mercy on us all.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In terms of things that are unforgivable, the Bible only makes clear that 'blaspheming the Holy Spirit" is unforgivable. But what does that mean? Is blaspheming Christ or God the Father forgivable? This seems odd. I'm going to go ahead and look at one of the early saints, John Chysostom had to say about that verse in the Gospel of Matthew:<br>  <br>  "[T]his sin is above all things unpardonable. Why so? Because {Christ} Himself indeed they did not know - who He might be - but of the Spirit they received ample experience. For the prophets also prophesied by the Spirit whatever they said …You are offended at Me, He implies, because of the flesh with which I am encompassed. Let it be so. But can you say of the Spirit also we do not know {Him}? And therefore your blasphemy is unpardonable."<br>  <br>  It seems that blaspheming the Holy Spirit is to make an affront against the actions of the Holy Spirit in our lives. In the context of the Gospel, the Pharisee's accuse Jesus of casting out demons in the name of the prince of demons. They essentially accuse God of being the devil. This is a rejection of God not from a lack of understanding His reality, but rather seeing Him and refusing His mercy and obstinately refusing His love. Ultimately blaspheming the Holy Spirit comes down to refusing to seek forgiveness and actively hating God.<br>  <br>  Suicide does not fall under this category. Suicide (in most cases) is caused by pain outweighing personal coping mechanisms. It's an awful thing, but it isn't instant damnation.<br>  <br>  Once again I'm sorry to hear about your loss. I hope you are doing alright.<br>  <br>  +God Bless|`|lcyV3WHAaa	It is not our place to say who goes to heaven or hell. In romans 10:6-9 it says <br>  <br>  (NASB) 6 But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down), 7 or 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)." 8 But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" - that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, 9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;<br>  <br>  Now as for the one Unforgivable sin, the bible speaks clearly on this in matthew 12:31-32<br>  <br>  (NASB) "Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. 32 "whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."<br>  <br>  and again in mark 3:28-29<br>  <br>  (NASB) "Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin" -<br>  <br>  Now these verses do not make any indications of suicide, and on the contrary, speaks of not being forgiven in this world or the next. Someone who commits suicide would only be in the next world, not remaining in this world to be forgiven.<br>  <br>  I personally see the unforgivable sin as turning from the Holy Spirit. We all have the opportunity to find God and if we deny that opportunity, if we turn from God and choose not to believe or accept the Holy Spirit into our lives, we have sinned the unforgivable sin. What else can we do and not receive forgiveness for?<br>  <br>  Jesus died for our sins and if we refuse to accept that gift and put our own self above it, then I personally believe that is the blaspheming of the Holy Spirit that is unforgivable.<br>  <br>  My prayers go out to you and I hope you find peace with your loss. Know that your loved one lives on in you and in those who knew them.

5RCg0IKeaa	It depends how you interpret the Bible. Many of those who believe that gay people do go to Hell think this is true because the bible says "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female."<br>  <br>  Many people interpret this as God meaning that if a man commits sexual acts with another man, he is going to Hell. (note that it didn't say anything about women lying with women)<br>  <br>  But, the Bible also says in Leviticus that you cannot eat shellfish, mix fabrics... and you can have multiple wives which you can stone, and have slaves. These aren't things that Christians take literally, so why should the part of men lying with men be taken literally? <br>  <br>  Also, in the New Testament, the son of God himself says "Judge not, lest ye be judged". Christianity is about the word of Christ, is it not? Christ doesn't WANT us to judge people, so judging against gay people is going against the wishes of Christ himself.<br>  <br>  You must also take into consideration that the Bible was not written by God himself, but rather, the people there during those times. It is very possible that the writers of certain passages may have been against homosexuals, or that through the ages as the Bible was translated and passed around, certain passages were changed to mean one thing, when it might not have meant that originally,  to fit the beliefs of the writers.<br>  <br>  The Bible is all about interpretation. I believe that if you trust in God, without necessarily agreeing on every exact thing in the Bible (as Bible passages can mean millions of different things.) you can still be a good Christian and not necessarily go to Hell. God loves us all, and God is a forgiving person. He understands us, and I think that he wouldn't damn you simply for loving someone of your own kind.|`|dqszKQfBaa	Heaven & hell don't exist.

That is to say, so that no one should be deprived, certain of its aims like Divine unity, the resurrection of the dead, and the story of Moses, have been repeated.

Tell him you understand that it is natural to make such noises, but also you find it quite offensive. Ask him if he could possibly help you with your problem by cutting down on the farts & burps, or simply leaving the room when he feels the urge. <br>  Good luck, I hope he changes because I wouldn't put up with such filthy behaviour! Yuck.

Dont ask questions like this|`|5lfW4v45aa	Shut up douchebag.|`|6v4KYFGoaa	I don't know about the chubby people dating other chubby people.<br>  I'm skinny as can be and my boyfriend has some fat on him. Well he is only a few pounds over weight...so nothing to be worried about. <br>  However it you are talking about really over weight people then I think that is true because then they don't have to worry about the other person thinking "Ew they are so fat!" But then again maybe not because I know this 400 pound lady whose husband is like twig.|`|OOTNTUQkaa	Yes, because their physical beings are similar and they feel accepted that way. And chubby people tend to be more sociable and I think two sociable ppl make a good couple.|`|nOT6vxIwaa	yes, salad dodgers seem to hang around with each other...........so they can have pie eating competitions and share mars bars which they eat sideways|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes. I think larger size people do hook up with each other because they do have more in common.|`|9okusH1kaa	Mississippi is the fattest state and Mexico is the second fattest country followed closely by England (America is far fatter than either). Just try looking for that in google and you'll see actual percentages. <br>  <br>  Yes, chubby people generally date each other. If a person is thin they don't have to settle for a chubby person. <br>  <br>  However, there are people that will stay thin until they have attracted a partner and then they will let themselves go and become enormous. This is something American women are famous for, and one reason that everyone says to look at a woman's mother before marrying her. This is a sign that the person has no respect for you, so if your partner becomes large, you should leave him or her.|`|bwgkbra5aa	I found that Mississippi is the Fattest State.<br>  <br>  And that America is BY FAR the Fattest Country in the World.<br>   <br>  Here's a link if you want to read up more on it;;<br>  <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/contest/why-america-is-the-fattest-country-in-the-world.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/contest/why-amer...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I personally think chubby people get with each other because they feel more secure. They lower their standards to someone just like them because they feel it's the best they can get. If they were with a skinny person they would constantly be comparing themselves to their partner. And a relationship couldn't last if you were in that mind set. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped. =)|`|v811KD7raa	last time i looked houston in texas was the fattest city in the US, with mexico the 2nd fattest country after the US<br>  <br>  apparently the police are so fat in mexico city they cant run after the crooks lmao|`|c2XzSKlAaa	Not really..more often I see couples composed of chubby and skinny people|`|JL1LnANEaa	i dont think so<br>  look at Norbit and Rasputia|`|hXpKechTaa	LOL.<br>  i always wanted to ask this but couldnt<br>  thanks
4sUek7ugaa	Good question.  If he died, he's not a god.  If he's a god, he couldn't really die.  If his body died but not his spirit, that's what Christian doctrine says will happen to humans.|`|8pQrIL90aa	My Dear Soul Jesus came down to die for man. He took on the coat of man (flesh) and he walked perfectly until he was delivered into the hands of the devil to be tortured. Satan thought he would give in, but the Lord held on and gave his own life up then he died. He sustained himself long as he was needed, then he let his life go.<br>  <br>  Jesus is forever more on the right hand side of God.

I don't care who he is. He raised himself from the dead while he was dead? That's a neat trick. I sort of support the swoon theory. Otherwise, him dying was an illusion. Instead of dying and being raised up, he would have just left his body behind in the first place and appeared as God to his disciples or he was God wearing a human disguise. Whatever.|`|1fb7aea767ff3f9acc21f4f310b2ee94aa	Jesus is God's _son_.

While the divine essence of Christ may not have died, the human essence of Jesus could experience death.  Therefore, the Son of G-d could participate in our fully human experience of life and death, by which G-d and Man could enter into a community of experience that is reenacted in the experience of the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  Grace be unto and peace.|`|yZgZJ7s7aa	Why dont you read the bible instead of asking people on the internet?|`|XEHcMkGtaa	Jesus was not God and he never died.|`|iCMrsV9daa	"because jesus is God in the flesh"<br>  Do you realise how absurd that sounds?|`|hc5YUT0paa	because jesus is God in the flesh|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Jesus' flesh died - His Spirit was thereafter quickened.

8Nqq7tkwaa	qwerty gave the months so...<br>  <br>  one thing about the WHY there are months set aside for a particular race or ethnic history..<br>  <br>  its not because anyone was oppressed or most oppressed. it's because for hundreds of years everyone except whites were ignored when it came to teaching or spotlighting accomplishments and contributions to this country's heritage. that was a deliberate thing. only whites mattered and therefore only white accomplishments were taught. that's all i ever heard about in school.<br>  <br>  so other races and ethnicities decided fine...we will set aside a month to teach about our own contributions. enough people pushed for it and it was instituted.<br>  <br>  if history had been taught in a fair and balanced way from the beginning, there would be no need for months set aside for each race or ethnicity.|`|StRaKUf6aa	There is a:<br>  1.

vbNVlcNNaa	It's THEIR country, not mine. They are free to do as they please in their country.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	It is their culture and religion.  If a person travels they should respect the laws of that country or suffer the consequences.<br>  <br>  Just like how some herbs that tribes smoke in Africa are illegal in Canada and we won't let them do it.  Even though to them it is as natural as walking down the street.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't disagree.|`|DvZdB66maa	I agree with the first poster. If you don't like it, then you should leave. Otherwise, you'll end up in a screwball country like the United States where people can basically walk on the street butt naked and it's acceptable. Pretty soon, we'll all be going to the grocery store in our birthday suits.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	its called the law...you should respect it...<br>  <br>  if you think that law is "ridculous" then leave the country and live somewhere else...it is not too hard of a concept.|`|6YyeqVMQaa	I'm not familiar with such laws, but many laws in Islamic nations seem extreme to us.<br>  But they often go along with Islamic teachings, which many people in those nations accept. So it works for them, from what I can see. It's just hard for us in the free, secular world to imagine such a thing being commonplace.|`|AA12133859	I do not live there so I do not care.

GGAbPiKDaa	AARP has people who help people who are over 50 file their tax returns. They are very familiar with the kind of tax return you need to file.

I  am disabled too and I  have already got my taxes done for free at the local senior center and will get back more in Federal this year than I  did last year|`|rm5Nt2VEaa	If you qualify for the stimulus check you will just automatically get it in May.  You don't have to do anything in order to get it.  But for your taxes I believe you should receive a w2 statement with your benefits you have received.  I have not got mine yet, but I know people who got them in January.
snj9zznvaa	she could be anemic<br>  but her symptom are ambiguous<br>  the only real way to get a correct diagnosis is to see a doctor<br>  but in the mean time improving her eating habit should have benefits<br>  here is some reading for you & signs to look for<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  I've replaced the Anorexia link for a more general one there is still a link on this page to Anorexia|`|dFBccLExaa	If you don't eat enough, eventually your body will reject the idea of eating. A lot of people with anorexia have that problem. She really needs to eat more- starting with foods that are easily digested, and then move up to eating more and eating more complex items. Plus, sleep would greatly help her. Your body can't process much without sleep. Sounds like she needs to get her schedule altered- fix her stress, eating, etc. so that she can be healthy. Otherwise, it could have long lasting negative impact.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Figuring out what's wrong is only the first step, and should be done by a trained physician. What you describe here is something that might require more than a medical doctor, too. Please urge your friend to go to a doctor, or at least some kind of clinic - or even a school counselor. This shouldn't be taken lightly, as serious repercussions can arise at any time.|`|DArAz67Caa	perhaps anorexia or depression------tell her to see a doctor----she might need further assistance----|`|J9RvdcKcaa	Anorexia?

I have had similar experiences, and quite simply she should see a doctor, either her pediatrician or a psychologist. <br>  <br>  Good luck to her.  <br>  <br>  You are a good friend to be concerned, but be aware depression does not go away because of a good friend. It is a serious medical disease and requires a doctor's aid. It does help to have a caring friend nearby to talk to, though.|`|P3MSoR1Taa	Sounds like anxiety, depression probably caused by stress. signs of anxiety are nausea, overeating or under eating, lack of sleep, dizziness.  but stress effects people in different ways|`|eAMq1iBWaa	or maybe bulimic<br>  <br>  she needs help|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Sounds like depression. She needs help from a doctor.<br>  <br>  It is NOT anorexia or bulimia because she isn't starving herself (you can get by just fine on one meal a day with snacks though its not good for you) and she isn't throwing up. If it was anorexia she'd go much longer without eating and she'd eat extremely little when she does eat.<br>  <br>  I've been through depression. It really sounds like depression.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Could be any number of things. She may be suffering from an eating disorder often associated with other things....bullemia...but has not arrived at the point where she actually upchucks.<br>  Or<br>  It could be just stress<br>  Or<br>  She could have the beginning of an ulcer<br>  Or<br>  She could be pregnant<br>  Of<br>  She is suffering from clinical depression.<br>  <br>  Any of the above would fit to some degree. Keep working on her to see a doctor. She needs help that neither you nor I can provide.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Yes, she needs to see a doctor!<br>  <br>  All this could be related to stress, and I hope that is all this is.<br>  <br>  If you can talk to a teacher or hers; hopefully she has one that actually cares about his/her student. Or talk to her parents, or sybling or someone that she might listen to. Get them to talk her into seeing a doctor. She would be better off letting a professional tell her what she needs to do for her health.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and God bless.|`|9d43ec02a222734089d9cf48ceafea47aa	can her parents not insist she goes to the doctors.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	could be just stress,it's hard i bet being young theses days......she'll snap out of it
VsamHLPOaa	Nothing you can do. Humans make assumptions off of first impressions, yes all of us even you. Its up to you to prove them wrong which it seems your doing from what your post says. People will always assume that will never change but their are worst things to be considered. Besides being nerdy isn't a bad thing. Be proud of it!|`|NvNyOUMwaa	forget about the image- jus enjoy urself n av fun !!! everythng will be fine!!|`|DvZdB66maa	It's just a stereotype, just like any other stereotype. You should learn to be comfortable in your own skin; but if you just can't stand it, then change the way you look... but be warned that you will experience stereotypes then, too.<br>  <br>  I used to be nerdy. I was always the "smart kid" in my classes, and I started university when I was only 16 years old. I dressed kinda geeky and wore glasses and all that... so people had those same ideas and stereotypes about me.<br>  <br>  But then, when I changed the way that I looked, the stereotypes didn't stop... instead, I just got stereotyped in a different way. Now, I'm attractive and I model and sing. I am still very much involved in academics though... but the problem is that people don't think that a person can be both intelligent AND attractive... and when people meet you, they see your exterior first. So now, people judge me as being ditzy and unintelligent, just because I am attractive.<br>  <br>  So decide what you want people to think about you. People will always judge you, because that's what they do... It's just up to you whether you want to be labeled "a geek" or a "dumb party boy."|`|6YyeqVMQaa	Just ignore the stereotypes and generalizations of society...only you and God truly know who you are. Just be who you want to be, and the people worth getting to know will respect you for that. Don't change a thing about you! :)

The annual fast of Ramadan is considered one of the five "pillars" of Islam. Muslims who are physically able are required to fast each day of the entire month, from sunrise to sunset. The evenings are spent enjoying family and community meals, engaging in prayer and spiritual reflection, and reading from the Qu'ran.<br>  <br>  During the blessed month of Ramadan, Muslims all over the world abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs during the daylight hours. As a time to purify the soul, refocus attention on God, and practice self-sacrifice, Ramadan is much more than just not eating and drinking<br>  <br>  Peace to All
iTEf1dP3aa	I think I'd go with them...I think if they didn't ask I'd question the situation, if it was just an excuse or not. I think there would def. be a 2nd date, if asked.

If I really liked them and was impressed I wouldn't hesitate. If I saw no future I would offer to go in with them but would exit as soon as they were around family, excusing myself as I was leaving {so no one could stop me}...kind of a movie exit {"Oh, I am so relieved you have all these people who know you...Let me know how it goes}...and then whisk! Gone! <br>  the second date depends on an overall impression.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Go with them, they obviously need the support in such a traumatic time. Wouldn't you? The focus is not on the second date here, but you would probably get one once their grandparent got well again. Kind of as a second first date.|`|7DlEN6lXaa	It wasn't a hypothetical question for my son. He was on a first date when his grandfather died.

If so, I probably would run away screaming, and hence no second date.<br>  But if this is someone you have met before, I would go to the hospital with them, adn as soon as they meet up with their family, I would split (the family becomes the support group, and a "stranger" is out of place; I also would not go in to see the sick Grandparent, it's kinda embarrassing for the patient). Second date would depend on how much I liked this person.<br>  All in all this situation is awkward, adn not very comfortable for you or her; your reaction kinda is on her radar, too. Toughy.|`|gKRwAUKiaa	I would go with them. <br>  Regardless of how awkward you act I would expect them to expect it, I mean how would you expect someone else to react if you were the one on the phone, and they came with you?  <br>  <br>  Not to mention it would put you in good standing with them, and show them that you are a caring individual.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	go with them and who knows if there would be a second..just gotta wait and see...<br>  <br>  Their grandparents health are obviously more important.

Why do you people have such a low regard for your god?|`|2fd64c0c321f7c4fb88d93ffd8ae2cbbaa	Well for one thing, God does not want anyone to go to Hell. He said in His word that "There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance." Luke 15:7 ESV. So God never wants anyone to be condemned to hell.<br>  <br>    Secondly, he will be received without fanfare for he is doomed to an eternity apart from God and in torment. This means that he will be tortured more than the average unsaved person who heard but didn't believe the Gospel of Christ but less than Stalin and Hitler and Mao.<br>  <br>     Lastly, Satan is by no means in charge of hell. He is the one who will be tormented most for all of eternity. He is 'a murderer and a liar from the beginning.' (I know the verse is there somewhere but I can't find it.) So he cannot determine who is punished and how, for he is the one who will be punished the most severely.|`|bnjjeBLYaa	Darwin saw God in the flow of nature, in the laws and the balance of the natural world.

KMrclzpLaa	well done. you took the words right out of my mouth =D|`|2tVQm7Llaa	I think that most - if not all - of the evil in the world is caused by humans as a result of free will. If God were to intervene every time a human decided to do something cruel and inhumane to another living creature, there would be little to no free will left. Some people also believe that God allows us to suffer as a learning experience and to strengthen and/or test our faith and/or character. <br>  <br>  The important thing to keep in mind is that most Christians rely heavily on faith and the idea that everything in life is a part of God's divine plan, a greater purpose if you will. They believe that even the "evil" in life has a purpose, whether we realize it or not.|`|xi9YtImfaa	God allows evil because he decided that people should have free will. It would be malevolent of God to force people to do his will. God gives everyone a choice to do evil or good and will judge them accordingly.

Nature could also be controlled in the same way. I think if you become a christian you are putting yourself on a path where you eventually end up wanting what is good in all situations, but this is all with one's consent, so doesn't abuse our freedom. But freedom of choice means some people behaving selfishly and hurting others.<br>  <br>  So He is omnipotent but doesn't exercise that power totally as He wants us to be free agents. The man, Roman or Greek, who originally came up with this argument would not like to lose his freedom I believe, and yet for God to prevent all evil in the way he suggests, freedom would have to be removed.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	The sentences above are someone's opinion about God, it is not fact.

((ty)))|`|VRl1jENHaa	This is a campaign first launched by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in January.  But do HRW's and other organizations' claims really stand up to investigation?<br>  <br>  1)      The number of HRW statements, their focus, and type of language used is far more intense than the organization's calls on Hamas to stop its use of human shields and of indiscriminate rocket attacks aimed at Israeli civilians  --  both war crimes under international humanitarian law. <br>  <br>  2)      HRW's claims are inconsistent and not subject to verification, following a pattern of political and ideological attacks in the 2006 Lebanon war (including false claims disseminated by HRW in the Qana incident), and in other examples, as documented by NGO Monitor. <br>  <br>  3)      HRW's "evidence" is based upon innuendo and "eyewitness" reports. One report states that "[o]n January 9, Human Rights Watch researchers on a ridge overlooking Gaza from the northwest observed multiple air-bursts of artillery-fired WP that appeared to be over the Gaza City/Jabaliya area. In addition, Human Rights Watch has analyzed photographs taken by the media on the Israel-Gaza border."  HRW does not name its researchers; it does not provide the exact location of its observation; nor does it identify the photos it "analyzed" making independent verification of this "evidence" impossible. <br>  <br>  4)      These HRW claims have been copied in the media (the Guardian, the Times (UK), Ha'aretz, CNN) and by other NGOs. On January 11, the day after HRW issued its reports, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights began issuing allegations of widespread Palestinian casualties and "burns" caused by white phosphorous "bombs".  Coincidence?  Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  As for the U.S. being a major arms supplier to Israel:  why is that relevent?  Israel pays for everything it receives and it's our ally.  And let's not forget one MAJOR factor:  there are several Middle Eastern nations that have repeatedly stated that it's their goal to eradicate Israel.  So why not supply them with weapons so they can protect their country?  Or are only non-Jewish countries "permitted" to defend themselves?<br>  <br>  Before you make a judgment based on the conclusions of Amnesty International and HRW, why don't you wait for the results of the "independent investigation"?  Aren't you rushing to judgment?<br>  <br>  FYI:  Israel will NEVER be "cut off."  Not only is there the Carter Doctrine to consider, and the fact that they are our allies, but GOD is protecting them as well.|`|YUAegpPoaa	While it is not a happy thought we are talking about the United States.<br>  <br>  A country which has a long history of selling arms to people and then looking the other way as long as they support our 'best interests'.<br>  A country which holds a veto on the security council.<br>  A country which has been persuaded to do very little, much less change any policy, based on the petitioning of Amnesty International.<br>  <br>  Bush has left and Obama is now President but...<br>  <br>  I do not say a sea change is impossible but I do not see it happening yet either.|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	I think people that deprive their family from an amount of money to cause this, isn't justified.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghm26garrnE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghm26garr...</a>|`|rn7UAtYJaa	Well, what are you going to do about it?

It's segregation, and segregation is not the answer. I thought only homophobes wanted school for homosexuals, so they wouldn't be with other "normal straight" kids?<br>  <br>  And what special laws are you talking about?|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	It's difficult to answer a sweeping statement about rights without a single law mentioned, or a single school or a single program mentioned that is just for homosexuals, so it's hard to say if something is equal or not without a bit of proof. I'd hazard a guess that schools right now are set up for heterosexuals and they already have heterosexual sex ed, heterosexual, dating events, and that heterosexual society is discussed in history, arts, and social sciences. Why the special treatment for hets?|`|bRAmXcowaa	because the law is a funny thing. <br>  You cannot delete a law, you have to make amendments to it in order for it to be inclusive.

To prevent these people from being discriminatory, regulations are put in place that leaglly prevent them from discriminating.<br>  <br>  The Lgbt face different issue to the hetro community. That is why different programms are needed, not just to benefit the LGBT community, but also the hetro community. How would you like to go to a Mens health issue group and have part of the session taken up with physical issues that do not affect the hetro community? <br>  <br>  the seperation of certain things is to give better service, rights, regulations and opportuities to BOTH sides of the sexual fence.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	I have asked for equal rights as a gay person many times, but have never asked for special laws, schools, or programs.<br>  <br>  FAIL|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Prejudice.|`|BuOHv2XKaa	Why did John Lennon leave the Beatles?|`|bbefiWtKaa	Um, no.

We have never asked for special schools. I think those schools just baby kids. And as for programs, the only ones I can think of  are the ones that are trying to make us more accepted. And as for special laws, all they do is re-establish the rights that were taken away from us. SO I don't see what your problem is? Are you against America?

It had already been around for awhile when it was bought by Parker Brothers in 1966 and turned into a commercial success as a board game. Its beginnings lie in the distant past when an earlier version (a tripod device) was used in the ancient ways of Babylon and Greece to contact departed spirits. The tripod became the pointer now used with the Board, which is printed with the alphabet, the numbers 1-9, a 0 (zero), and the words 'Goodbye', 'Yes', and 'No'. There are other boards like this with different names, but with the same history and purpose. The modern version of this game was developed by a man named Planchette, a spiritualist (someone who contacts the dead as part of their religion). The Board was further transformed around the turn of the century under the direction and ownership of two men, Elijah J. Bond and William Fuld. Fuld's name can be seen on the Ouija Board today. The name Ouija is a combination of the French and German words for 'yes': Oui and Ja. According to Bond and Fuld, the Board suggested its own name. The primary purpose of the board is and always has been to contact disembodied spirits. Contacting the dead is called necromancy, and contacting spirits is spiritism, both strongly condemned by God (Deut. 18:9-12; Lev. 19:31, 20:6; I Sam 28, II Kings 21:6; Is. 8:19, 19:3-4). The Board's translated name, 'yes, yes', is an ingenious and subtle way to invite spirit contact. Dead people cannot hang around after death; you cannot communicate with a dead person. The practices and techniques of contacting the dead and contacting spirits are used widely in the occult. Although the pointer is often moved intentionally or subconsciously by the players, you are putting yourself in a vulnerable position when using the Board. By 'playing' this 'game', you are showing an interest in spirit contact. If contact is made, it is demons (evil spirits, fallen angels), not the dead, who are responding. If Satan can disguise himself as "an angel of light" (2 Cor. 11:14), then it is not improbable that fallen angels can disguise themselves as the dead. The Ouija Board is not harmless just because it is marketed as a game. Satan, the master of deception and seduction, is good at twisting the truth into lies (Gen. 3:1-6; Jn. 8:44). Satan likes disguises and his lies are often disguised as games. The next time you are tempted to play the Ouija Board as a game, look beyond its disguise and see it for what it really is. Think about this: Just what or who are you trying to contact? God tells us to seek Him instead of the dead (Is. 8:19), and Christ "lives forever to plead with God" on behalf of those who believe Him (Heb. 7:25). Who wants the Ouija Board when you can know the One Who has "complete authority in heaven and on earth!" (Matt.28:18). If you are wondering about Christ, think on His words in John 5:23-24, "He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life."|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	you contact spirits.<br>  <br>  i used to have one. it was really creepy, i will never have one again.<br>  especially in my house, they say the spirits get stuck in your house..<br>  <br>  but on the other hand.. its produced by Milton Bradley, lol|`|3rv5mjfeaa	It is "a" Ouija Board, not an.|`|Sf6ZQoXOaa	it's a device used to communicate with the dead, used before the advent of text messaging, and no it isn't a oija its an ouija, grammatically speaking

iCqfmRC3aa	I travel to many resorts and beaches ... I love my job ... and I personally prefer to be pubic bare, but overall I'd say it is probably 55-60% do not shave and 40-45% do ... so it really is a personal decision and no one will say anything either way.<br>  <br>  I haven't seen anyone that shaves ALL their body hair, but I suppose it does happen and maybe I just didn't notice.<br>  <br>  However, I will caution you that shaving pubic hair, being curly, is much more prone to in-grown hairs. The bumps and pimple looking infected hair can be very embarrassing.  If you do decide to shave, I would suggest you use an acne medicine, especially a moisturizer with Salicylic acid, if you develop any problems.  Now, that said, Salicylic acid is pretty harsh, so don't put it on the boys. lol.  I use a moisturizer that is only 0.5% Salicylic acid for them and use a moisturizer that is 2% Salicylic acid in the pubic area itself.<br>  <br>  Many just trim the area so it doesn't look overgrown.  If you are starting out, that is what I would do.  Trim it down, and down and down until you get the look and feel you want.  That is how I did it, I just kept trimming it shorter, until it became easier to just shave it.<br>  <br>  Do NOT use an epilator unless you are a masochist.  Damn that hurts.  In case you don't know, epilators YANK the hair out by the root.  It was a very short lived trial for me.|`|AA11971497	Nudist or not, people choose or not to modify their appearance, either for practical reasons, or just because they think they look better with the changes.<br>  <br>  I choose to wear a tightly trimmed beard, not so much because I like the way it looks, but because it's a pain to stay clean shaven.  For the same reason, as a nudist, I don't shave anywhere else, though trimming myself would be a reasonable thing to do, just as I trim my beard.<br>  <br>  To each his or her own.  Which is, once you understand it, is the whole point.|`|WuBQNC10aa	The "smoothie" trend is up. Personally, it's not for me. I'm not about ready to shave or wax the boys. I notice shaving much more at clubs and beaches closer to urban areas than I do at clubs in more rural areas, but it doesn't really matter. Do what you want to do. No one will say anything to you either way.|`|OmSJR5UFaa	Shave it if you look like a gorilla.  Otherwise, leave it alone.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Some do.  Most don't.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	You can shave it if you want but its really not necessary or required.

Everyone is bisexual inside. No one can be PERFECTLY straight like a pin. Everyone is like that pin thats not that straight but not that crooked.. Get it? Don't worry about it :) I can perfectly well say a girl looks hot or sexy and not be a lesbian or bisexual. it's alright. Lesbians turn me on sure, but I don't go around making out with girls or having sex with them.<br>  <br>  You are only gay if you actually go and have sex with a gay. You probably aren't really that bisexual. I would just experiment and go out there and enjoy yourself. nothing wrong with being bi or gay! Just don't be attracted to a teacher lol! They are there to teach not to please your eyes!!! ;)<br>  <br>  It's hard for me to tell you WHAT you are, so it's up to you to find out :) I say go for that girl and see what happens! Good Luck Hun!|`|TVUstrw0aa	maybe he's a role-model, and you really respect him... maybe your getting thsoe feelings mixed up with your "love" feelings.... but maybe you are gay or bi....(don't get with your teacher is all I can say)... but give it time.

En muchos animales, el cerebro se localiza en la cabeza. Este tiene una superficie aproximada en los humanos de 2 m2, y cabe en el cráneo debido a que esta doblado/plegado de una forma muy peculiar. El cerebro es el único órgano completamente protegido por una bóveda ósea y alojado en la cavidad craneal.<br>  <br>  El cerebro usa la energía bioquímica procedente del metabolismo celular como desencadenante de las reacciones neuronales. Los 'paquetes' de energía se reciben por las dendritas y se emiten por los axones en forma de neurotransmisores.<br>  <br>  Cada neurona pertenece a una región metabólica encargada de compensar la deficiencia o exceso de cargas en otras neuronas. Se puede decir que el proceso se ha completado cuando la región afectada deja de ser activa. Cuando la activación de una región tiene como consecuencia la activación de otra diferente, se puede decir que entre ambas regiones ha habido un intercambio biomolecular. Todos los resultados y reacciones desencadenantes son transmitidos por neurotransmisores, y el alcance de dicha reacción puede ser inmediata (afecta directamente a otras neuronas pertenecientes a la misma región de proceso), local (afecta a otra región de proceso ajena a la inicial) y/o global (afecta a todo el sistema nervioso).<br>  <br>  Dada la naturaleza de la electricidad en el cerebro, se ha convenido en llamarlo bioelectricidad. El comportamiento de la electricidad es esencialmente igual tanto en un conductor de cobre como en los axones neuronales. Si bien lo que porta la carga dentro del sistema nervioso es lo que hace diferente el funcionamiento entre ambos sistemas de conducción eléctrica. En el caso del sistema nervioso, lo porta el neurotransmisor.<br>  <br>  Un neurotransmisor es una molécula en estado de transición, con deficit o superavit de cargas. Este estado de transición le da un tiempo máximo de estabilidad de unas cuantas vibraciones moleculares. El medio por el cual se transmite es la mielina, responsable de la sinapsis neuronal, que conecta con el grupo de receptores dentítricos, descargando en la dentríta específica que admite el neurotransmisor portador de la carga.<br>  <br>  El paso del neurotransmisor por los axones estimula la creación de mielina, por lo que a mayor cantidad de mielina menor resistencia a la transmisión y menor uso de recursos.<br>  <br>  El esquema de funcionamiento sería el siguiente: Neurona A demanda paquete de energía, neurona B recibe el estímulo. Neurona B procesa paquete de energía, neurona B emite paquete de energía con carga eléctrica. El paquete es transmitido por el cuerpo del axón gracias al recubrimiento lipídico, y es llevado hasta la dentrita de la neurona A que tiene por costumbre recibir ese tipo de paquetes. El tryaxón de la Neurona B libera el paquete y la neurona A lo descompone.<br>  <br>  Entendido esto (en rasgos muy generales), se establece que, tanto un sistema de transmisión de cobre tiene resistencia al paso de las cargas electricas, de forma equivalente, el sistema nervioso tiene una resistencia al paso de las cargas bioeléctricas, establecido (principalmente) por la cantidad de mielina en los axones. Otros aspectos a tener en cuenta en dicha 'resistencia', serían los siguientes:<br>  <br>  Metabolismo <br>  <br>  Tipo de molécula que porta la carga. <br>  Tiempo en el que esa molécula conserva sus propiedades. <br>  Variación de la entalpía. <br>  <br>  Otros factores. <br>  <br>  No todas las neuronas son productoras de mielina, por lo que no toda neurotransmisión tiene el mismo patrón específico, pero sí general.<br>  <br>  El cerebro procesa la información sensorial, controla y coordina el movimiento, el comportamiento y las funciones corporales homeostáticas, como los latidos del corazón, la presión sanguínea, el balance de fluidos y la temperatura corporal. El cerebro es responsable de la cognición, las emociones, la memoria y el aprendizaje.<br>  <br>  La capacidad de procesamiento y almacenamiento de un cerebro humano estandar supera aun a las mejores computadores hoy en día. Algunos científicos tienen la creencia que un cerebro que realice una mayor cantidad de sinapsis puede desarrollar mayor inteligencia que uno con menor desarrollo neuronal.<br>  <br>  Hasta no hace muchos a?os, se pensaba que el cerebro tenía zonas exclusivas de funcionamiento hasta que por medio de imagenología se pudo determinar que cuando se realiza una función, el cerebro actúa de manera semejante a una orquesta sinfónica interacuando varias areas entre si. Además se pudo establecer que cuando un área cerebral no especializada, es da?ada, otra área puede realizar un reemplazo parcial de sus funciones.<br>  <br>  En los lóbulos parietales se desarrolla el sistema emocional y el sistema valorativo. El sistema emocional esta en las 2 amígdalas cerebrales (situadas cada una detrás del ojo, a una profundidad de aproximadamente 5cm), en estas están todas las emociones que tenemos y que damos cuando algo o alguien interfiere en la actividad que este haciendo en el exterior. Por otra parte esta el sistema valorativo, este es la relación que existe entre los lóbulos prefrontales (que como su nombre lo indica esta atrás de la frente)y las amígdalas cerebrales, esa relación "física" se llama hipocampo.<br>  <br>  La percepción sonora del habla se produce en el giro de Heschl, en los hemisferios derecho e izquierdo. Esas informaciones se transfieren al área de Wernicke y al lóbulo parietal inferior, que reconocen la segmentación fonemática de lo escuchado y, junto con la corteza prefrontal, interpretan esos sonidos. Para identificar el significado, contrastan esa información con la contenida en varias áreas del lóbulo temporal.<br>  <br>  El área de Wernicke, encargada de la descodificación de lo oído y de la preparación de posibles respuestas, da paso después al área de Broca, en la que se activa el accionamiento de los músculos fonadores para asegurar la producción de sonidos articulados, lo que tiene lugar en el área motora primaria, de donde parten las órdenes a los músculos fonadores.<br>  <br>  El cerebro humano adulto, en condiciones normales, puede generar nuevas neuronas. Estas nuevas células se producen en el hipocampo, región relacionada con la memoria y el aprendizaje. Las células madre, origen de esas neuronas, pueden constituir así una reserva potencial para la regeneración neuronal de un sistema nervioso da?ado.<br>  <br>  No obstante, la capacidad regenerativa del cerebro es escasa, en comparación con otros tejidos del organismo. Esto se debe a la escasez de esas células madre en el conjunto del sistema nervioso central y a la inhibición de la diferenciación neuronal por factores microambientales.<br>  <br>  El cerebro, junto con el corazón, es uno de los dos órganos más importantes del cuerpo humano. Una pérdida de funcionalidad de este órgano lleva a la muerte. Por otro lado, los da?os en el cerebro causan pérdidas de inteligencia, memoria y control del cuerpo. En la mayor parte de los casos, estos da?os suelen deberse a inflamaciones, edemas, o impactos en la cabeza. Los accidentes cerebrovasculares producidos por el bloqueo de vasos sanguíneos del cerebro son también una causa importante de muerte y da?o cerebral.<br>  <br>  Otros problemas cerebrales se pueden clasificar mejor como enfermedades que como da?os. Las enfermedades neurodegenerativas como la enfermedad de Alzheimer, la enfermedad de Parkinson, la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica y la enfermedad de Huntington están causadas por la muerte gradual de neuronas individuales y actualmente sólo se pueden tratar sus síntomas. Las enfermedades mentales como la depresión clínica, la esquizofrenia, el desorden bipolar y el trastorno de estrés postraumático tienen una base biológica teórica en el cerebro y suelen tratarse con terapia psiquiátrica, drogas o una combinación de ambas.<br>  <br>  Algunas enfermedades infecciosas que afectan al cerebro vienen causadas por virus o bacterias. La infección de las meninges puede llevar a una meningitis. La encefalopatía espongiforme bovina, también conocida como el mal de las vacas locas, es una enfermedad mortal entre el ganado y se asocia a priones. Asimismo, se ha verificado que la esclerosis múltiple, la enfermedad de Parkinson y la enfermedad de Lyme, así como la encefalopatía y la encefalomielitis, tienen causas virales o bacterianas.<br>  <br>  Algunos desórdenes del cerebro son congénitos. La enfermedad de Tay-Sachs, el síndrome X frágil, el síndrome deleción 22q13, el síndrome de Down y el síndrome de Tourette están asociados a errores genéticos o cromosómicos.<br>  <br>  Está compuesto por unos 10 a 15 mil millones de neuronas, cada una de las cuales se interconecta con otras por un número de sinapsis que va de varios centenares a más de 20.000, formando una red estructural que es unas 100 veces más compleja que la red telefónica mundial. <br>  Toda experiencia sensorial, consciente o inconsciente, queda registrada en el aparato neuronal y podrá ser evocada posteriormente, si se dan ciertas condiciones propicias; y algo parecido sucede con nuestro conocimiento hereditario inconsciente que constituye una base de potencialidad aun mucho mayor (Popper, 1980, p.136-7). <br>  Igualmente, la vastedad y los recursos de la mente son tan eficientes que el hombre puede elegir, en un instante dado, cada una de las (104) * 10 sentencias diferentes de que dispone una lengua culta (Polanyi, 1969, p. 151). <br>  Estos y otros datos similares nos llevan a concluir que el cerebro humano es la realidad más eficiente en cuanto a consumo y transformación de la energía se refiere, en lo que nos hemos podido encontrar en este universo. Es una verdadera máquina de la transformación de la energía y un ejemplo a seguir por los estudiosos de la termodinámica. Nos podemos preguntar qué sentido o significado tiene, o qué función desempe?a, esta asombrosa capacidad del cerebro humano que reside en su optimizada manera de memorizar y en su constante aumento de la velocidad de procesar información. Nuestra respuesta es que esa dotación gigantesca está ahí, esperando a que se le ense?e cual es la disposición sináptica que permitirá a las especies más evolucionadas, subsistir por más tiempo sobre la tierra.<br>  <br>  La comparación que existe entre las maravillosas memorias mecánicas de computadoras u ordenadores, así como de otros métodos de retener información, y la capacidad rememorativa del cerebro humano se se?ala en diferentes estudios.<br>  <br>  El cerebro humano todavía tiene una capacidad 10 veces mayor que lo que está almacenado en los Archivos Nacionales de Estados Unidos, 500 veces mayor que un sistema de memoria de un ordenador avanzado y 10.000 veces mayor que lo que está registrado en la “Encyclop?dia Britannica.”<br>  <br>  Dispositivo de memoria y capacidad de almacenaje (cantidad de caracteres) Cerebro humano 125.000.000.000.000.000, Archivos Nacionales de Estados Unidos: 12.500.000.000.000.000, Cartucho magnético 3850 IBM: 250.000.000.000.000, “Encyclopedia Britannica”: 12.500.000.000.000, Disco magnético (duro): 313.000.000<br>  Libro: 1.300.000<br>  <br>  A pesar del gran número de especies animales en los que se puede encontrar cerebro, hay un gran número de características comunes en su configuración celular, estructural y funcional. A nivel celular, el cerebro se compone de dos clases de células: las neuronas y las neuroglías. Las neuronas se conectan entre sí para formar circuitos neuronales similares (pero no idénticos) a los circuitos eléctricos sintéticos. El cerebro se divide en secciones separadas espacialmente, composicionalmente y en muchos casos, funcionalmente. En los mamíferos, estas partes son el telencéfalo, el cerebelo y el tronco del encéfalo. Estas secciones se pueden dividir a su vez en hemisferios, lóbulos, córtex, áreas, etc.<br>  <br>  El principal tipo de neurona que podemos encontrar en el cerebro es la interneurona (definida como cualquier neurona que no abandona el sistema nervioso central), sin embargo también están presentes las neuronas aferentes y las eferentes a través del tronco cerebral. El cerebro contiene cerca de 10 neuroglías por cada neurona, y tradicionalmente se ha visto que su función es la de desarrollar el papel de apoyo de las neuronas y de rellenar el espacio que queda entre ellas (de ahí su nombre, "pegamento" en griego). La mayor parte de las neuroglías del cerebro (y del resto del sistema nervioso central) están presentes en todo el sistema nervioso (a excepción del oligodendrocito).<br>  <br>  El cerebro del los mamíferos posee, aparte del tejido nervioso citado arriba, una cierta cantidad de tejido conectivo llamado meninges. Se trata de un sistema de membranas que separan el cráneo del cerebro. El cerebro está suspendido en el líquido cefalorraquídeo formado en los plexos coroideos y que circula entre las capas de las meninges, concretamente por el espacio subaracnoideo, y a través de cavidades en el cerebro llamadas ventrículos, y su función es importante desde el punto de vista químico (en el metabolismo) y físico (en la prevención de golpes).<br>  <br>  El cerebro humano está dividido por la fisura interhemisférica en dos hemisferios cerebrales, uno derecho y otro izquierdo, encontrándose en cada hemisferio otras fisuras, aunque menos profundas que ésta, que dividen la superficie cerebral en varias partes llamadas lóbulos.<br>  <br>  Aun cuando ambos hemisferios humanos son inversos, no son la imagen invertida uno del otro. Son asimétricos . El Homo Erectus que no fue antepasado nuestro, fue de los primeros en tenerlo asimétrico, como el hombre moderno. la asimetría es un rasgo de aumento de la especialización, de una capacidad cognitiva más compleja. Ante todo se?alar que las diferencias funcionales entre hemisferios son mínimas y sólo en algunas pocas áreas se han podido encontrar diferencias en cuanto a funcionamiento y éstas no en todas las personas. La diferencia de competencias entre los dos hemisferios cerebrales parece ser exclusiva del ser humano. Se ha dicho que nuestros cerebros se han especializado de este modo, porque el lenguaje y la lógica necesitan procesos de pensamiento más ordenados y sofisticados que los que necesita, por ejemplo, la orientación espacial. Se trata simplemente de que las dos mitades del cerebro son complementarias. La paleoneurología quiere explicar los saltos evolutivos del hombre. Además de revelar el tama?o de un cerebro, examina las impresiones de las características de la superficie del cerebro dejadas en el interior de la calavera. Al comparar la forma del de los homínidos que vivieron hace 2,5 millones de a?os, el austrolopithecus Africanus y el Parantropus, se han encontrado grandes diferencias en el lóbulo frontal, que controla la cognición más elevada. Esta configuración sugiere que el Africanus había desarrollado más la región que juega un papel clave en la toma de decisiones, en la iniciativa y en la planificación. Humanos y chimpancés se separaron hace unos 5 o 6 millones de a?os, lo que encaja con el descubrimiento de que la Tierra se volvió más fría y más seca hace 6,5 millones de a?os, el tipo de cambio climático que da paso a la aparición de nuevas especies. En 2006 se descubrió el gen HAR1 presente en animales como las aves y los mamíferos, incluido el hombre. Desde hace 310 millones de a?os hasta hace unos 5 millones, en el HAR1 cambiaron solo dos de sus 118 letras químicas, pero son 18 las que han cambiado en el breve lapsoentre el linaje del chimpancé y el hombre. El cerebro, más que otro órgano, se ha beneficiado de las ventajas del gen. Supuestamente ayudó a que las cortezas cerebrales desarrollaran pliegos característicos de un cerebro complejo, y la química cerebral también avanzó. El gen regula la producción de una molécula, la prodinorfina que motiva la percepción, el comportamiento y la memoria. A partir de este descubrimiento un grupo de investigación neurogenetica de la UCLA bajo la dirección de Daniel Geschwind examina qué combinaciones de genes están activas en la corteza cerebral. La hormona oxitocina, conocida por inducir las contracciones y la galactogenia de las madres, también opera en el cerebro. En él promueve la confianza en los demás y por lo tanto el comportamiento cooperativo que hace que grupos de personas vivan juntos por el bien común.<br>  <br>  Siempre he pensado que los científicos al momento de no comprender, no encontrarle lógica a cosas complejas, simplemente te dan razonamientos ilógicos con tal de darte una razón del ser.<br>  <br>  El se humano utiliza al 100% el cerebro cuando desarrollamos nuestra inteligencia, sino haces esto las neuronas se mueren, las neuronas que trabajan, las que utilizas son las que se regeneran.<br>  <br>  Aún las personas con discapacidades utilizan el 100% de su cerebro si les brindas ayuda, apoyo, si les das amor que es lo que mueve al mundo.<br>  <br>  Saludos y espero que te des tiempo de leerlo.|`|fabcfb75718fffe4f4f7d8286d01be2baa	hola<br>  tu te refieres a que pasaria si se ocupa el  90% del cerebro serias un ser superdotado y con todos los dones desarrollados, porque como he dicho antes todos tenemos chispa divina si, ya lo sabes esa chispa divina no hace a la semejanza de Nuestro Dios, y lo que ha hecho el Divino Maestro nosotros porque no? es cuestion de querer hacerlo pero no se nos dara la capaciadad hasta que estemos listos <br>  hasta entonces.<br>  <br>  <br>  "A vosotros Yo vengo, el primero de toda la raza en ser trasmutado en la imagen del Yo Soy"<br>  "Lo que Yo he hecho, todos los hombres harán; y lo que Yo soy, todos los hombres serán"<br>  Jesus el Cristo<br>  <br>  <br>  besos y suerte|`|oYInHAKsaa	Yo uso el 100% de mi cerebro, y cuando no lo hago me duele la cabeza.

FwueK3F9aa	Dr Zoom is correct, what you are describing is your power animal. A power animal is your protector think of it as a guardian angel and it has been with you since birth. Now while you might have a primary power animal you will meet many, many other in your life for various reasons so there really is no end to the animals you will meet.<br>  <br>  A power animal is usually the animal a person most identifies with. Say  a child had posters of foxes and stuffed foxes ect then it would be likely that a fox is that child's power animal however a power animal can also be an animal that you fear.<br>  <br>  The best way is to a journey to meet your power animal and ask it directly what questions you have, your power animal will never lie to you and will always be there to help you. <br>  <br>  I would suggest any of the following books below and since the journey to meet your power animal is actually quite simple you could just drop by local Barnes & Noble or Boarders and find one of them or another book on shamanism and read about the journey.<br>  <br>  Sandra Ingerman "Shamanic Journeying: A Beginner's Guide"<br>  Thomas Cowan "Shamanism: As a Spiritual Practice for Daily Life"<br>  Katie Weatherup "Practical Shamanism: A guide for Walking in Both Worlds"<br>  <br>  Good luck on your journey.|`|33IuwFJpaa	You can start by asking yourself what is your absolute favorite animal since you were a child?  This animal has been around you in some form, usually beginning as a stuffed animal!  :-)  <br>  <br>  From there, you can look up your birth on a Native American Wheel of the Year.  For instance, I was born in November, and Grizzly Bear rules the West (November is in the West with October, which is NorthWest and December which is SouthWest).  <br>  <br>  Please keep in mind that there are many different tribes of Native Americans, each with their own belief system.  If you believe you have Native American blood, then it is best to follow as closely as possible with your tribe.  If you are not native American, then it really doesn't matter what your animal totem is or how many you might have unless you choose to adopt that spiritual practice.  <br>  <br>  If you choose not to follow a native american path, then look to other pagan beliefs as different gods and goddesses were associated with their own familiar, some cats, wolves, horses, ravens, etc.  |`|nNf9tYXbaa	A totem is any supposed entity that watches over or assists a group of people, such as a family, clan or tribe.<br>  <br>  Totems support larger groups than the individual person. In kinship and descent, if the apical ancestor of a clan is nonhuman, it is called a totem. Normally this belief is accompanied by a totemic myth.<br>  <br>  Although the term is of Ojibwa origin, totemistic beliefs are not limited to Native American Indians. Similar totemism-like beliefs have been historically found throughout much of the world, including Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, Australia and the Arctic polar region.<br>  <br>  In modern times, some single individuals, not otherwise involved in the practice of a tribal religion, have chosen to adopt a personal spirit animal helper, which has special meaning to them, and refer to this as a totem. This non-traditional usage of the term is prevalent in, but not limited to, the New Age movement, and the Mythopoetic men's movement.|`|uYXkcLJiaa	go on a vision quest. follow yer own religion. if yer not native.

Cuando ya había inundaciones paso una lancha de rescate y el dijo "Dios me salvara." Llego un helicóptero de la cruz roja y el dijo "Dios me salvara." <br>  Cuando llego a la presencia de Dios el le reclamo y le dijo -Por que Dios, por que no me ayudaste? Yo siempre tuve confianza en ti y tu no me salvaste.

Sería cuestión de que analice la situación general, qué es lo que quiere o busca al ejercer su profesión, trazarse un plan y hacer lo que esté en sus posibilidades por llevarlo a cabo. Debe empezar por sentirse bien haciendo lo que hace, de otro modo es difícil evitar desilusiones.

Conozco a demasiadas personas que por estar solas, "se sienten solas" (Que no es lo mismo, ojo) y hacen cosas muy estúpidas, como buscarse de novi@ a la primera persona que se les aparece, aún cuando a leguas se nota que es una super mala elección; la alegría les dura dos semanas y después andan peor que cuando estaban solos y lo que es aún peor, no saben como salirse de ahí y la mayoría terminan casados o más bien atrapados.<br>  <br>  La recomendación es tratar de sentire a gusto con tu soledad; recordar que tú eres tu mejor amigo porque eres el único que te acompa?a, escucha y vive tus mismas situaciones. Cuando estés a gusto con tu soledad y cuando te des cuenta de que no te vas a morir por estar acompa?ado o por estar solo, es cuando estarás listo para una relación; y mejor aún si la otra persona tiene esa misma concepción sobre la vida.

To do something for yourself is to do something that you benefit from, like buying yourself a new video game or getting a makeover.<br>  <br>  The above poster has a good point.

bcdb9e4ddb5d59f252bd90f2a47fc8ebaa	Si aqui en veracruz, ma?ana es el primer gran desfile pero me parece que este a?o no estará tan bueno porque hay mal tiempo, eso lo opaca un poco. Aunque aqui le dicen que es el mas alegre del mundo, empezó el 14 de febrero con la quema del malhumor que es una figura de carton con la imagen de alguien muy odioso, este a?o fué Tissiano "Perro" . De ahi coronan al rey de la Alegria (o rey feo) reyes infantiles y Reina del Carnaval que son elegidos anticipadamente por la comunidad. El sabado , domingo, lunes y martes previos al miercoles de ceniza son los cuatro gran desfiles de carnaval. Carros alegóricos en el boulebard de la ciudad, comparsas, disfraces, bastoneras, bandas de musica, artistas, etc.  Millones de personas asisten a verlo. Son 5 desfiles y cada uno dura alrededor de 4 horas. <br>  En lo particular a mi no me gusta mucho asistir,  aunque de mas joven solia estar presente y hasta desfilé en los carros alegóricos, pero ahora prefiero verlo desde mi televisor. Hay muchos ebrios, demasiados orinandose en la calle, delincuentes y se aprovechan cuando la gente sale a ver los desfiles para saquear sus casas. Sera que me estoy volviendo vieja?

SDHvDNGJaa	Mhh, las zonas mas afectadas durante el Terremoto de 1985 en la Ciudad de México fueron la Colonia Roma, la zona de hospitales cercana al metro Zapata, El Eje Central Lázaro Cárdenas, a a altura de la Torre Latinoamericana, Tlatelolco, en Avenida Juárez, el Hotel Regis y el Cine Regis. Era un hotel muy turìstico, no se tienen los datos exactos, pero como el sismo ocurrió temprano en la ma?ana, a las 7:19 se presupone que si, murió mucha gente en ese hotel.  También por esa zona quedò altamente da?ado el Hotel del Prado. Actualmente en la zona que ocupaban el Hotel Regis, el Cine Regis y una tienda comercial se ubica la Plaza de la Solidaridad, en honor a la Sociedad Civil Mexicana, quien tuvo un papel muy importante en el rescate de los sobrevivientes del sismo.|`|2b13f88655d8e3054a355e7c0efd79b3aa	Lo que era todo el centro, fábricas de ropa, Centro Médico Nacional, Hospital General, Unidad Tlatelolco.El reciente sismo registrado como de magnitud 8.1 en la escala de Richter presenta características peculiares por lo que respecta a algunas zonas del valle de México. Si bien se han hecho diversas hipótesis sobre las razones de que haya causado tan gran destrucción, se puede decir que hasta ahora ninguna de ellas ha sido debidamente fundamentada con arreglo a la ciencia. <br>  Es decir, que debieron ocurrir oscilaciones máximas, por ejemplo a lo largo de Insurgentes Sur y después otra vez solo hasta la calzada de Tlalpan, con da?os menores entre esas dos avenidas. Resulta claro que el fenómeno no presentó esas características, pues la destrucción fue generalizada en grandes zonas de la ciudad. <br>  aproximadamente 650 inmuebles da?ados en las colonias, Roma Sur y Norte, Doctores. Buenos Aires, Centro, Juárez, Cuauhtémoc v San Rafael, <br>   la sierra del Tepeyac al cerro del Pe?o de los Ba?os, próximo al aeropuerto de la ciudad y que constituye, por lo tanto, la prolongación de la propia sierra del Tepeyac hacia el sur. La existencia de esta sierra se puede verificar en el plano gravimétrico del valle de México ven la composición semejante de las rocas que forman la sierra del Tepeyac y el cerro del Pe?o. La presencia de esta sierra cubierta por sedimentos es muy importante, ya que si ella no actuara como reflector de las ondas no se presentarían los fenómenos de interferencia observados, Esta sierra es sensiblemente perpendicular a la dirección entre el Distrito Federal y el epicentro del temblor frente a Michoacán, por lo que resulta un efectivo reflector de ondas provenientes de la región Michoacán-Colima, no así de otras zonas de subduccion localizadas al sur de las costas de Michoacán. <br>   la zona de la colonia Roma v su vecindad, donde se muestran los puntos en los que se observaron da?os v los lineamientos correspondientes a algunos de esos puntos, respectivamente. Se muestran 440 puntos y 20 líneas, las que contienen alrededor de 80 por ciento de dichos puntos. Estas líneas representan los lugares en donde las ondas interactuaron sumando sus amplitudes, ya fuera hacía arriba o hacía abajo, provocando las elevaciones y hundimientos locales que se observaron. La flecha del segundo plano Indica la dirección aproximada en que se propagaron las ondas incidentes. <br>  No encontré exactamente la ubicación, pero fué una tragedia que conmovio a todo el país e internacionalmente prestarón apoyo, muchos países.

El Se?or Jesús dijo que no sacábamos nada con inquietarnos por el día siguiente, porque cada día tiene sus propios problemas, allí en  Lucas 12:22-26 "Entonces dijo a sus discípulos: “Por esta razón les digo: Dejen de inquietarse respecto a su alma, en cuanto a qué comerán, o respecto a su cuerpo, en cuanto a qué se pondrán. 23 Porque el alma vale más que el alimento, y el cuerpo que la ropa. 24 Reparen en los cuervos, que ni siembran ni siegan, y no tienen ni troje ni granero, y sin embargo Dios los alimenta. ?Cuánto más valen ustedes que las aves? 25 ?Quién de ustedes, por medio de inquietarse, puede a?adir un codo a la duración de su vida? 26 Pues, si no pueden hacer la cosa mínima, ?por qué inquietarse por las demás cosas?"<br>   Así es que el día a día trato de enfrentarlo con esa actitud. Aunque no puedo negarte que hay problema que parecen monta?as y que me inquietan bastante la vida, pero trato de recordar que tengo "una cartita bajo la manga". A Jehová como ayudante.<br>  El apóstol Pablo indicó la clase de Ayudante que tenemos al decir lo que se registró en Hebreos 13:5-6:" Que [su] modo de vivir esté exento del amor al dinero, y estén contentos con las cosas presentes. Porque él ha dicho: “De ningún modo te dejaré y de ningún modo te desampararé”. 6 De modo que podemos tener buen ánimo y decir: “Jehová es mi ayudante; no tendré miedo. ?Qué puede hacerme el hombre?”.<br>  Aunque vi que algunos que te respondieron dijeron que no se debe confiar en la Biblia, no saben lo que se pierden. No hay NADA más poderoso que la Palabra de Jehová a la hora de enfrentar los problemas.<br>  <br>  Un gran abrazo para ti?<br>  Angélica|`|XqUVMWd7aa	con la frialdad de un animal  del bosque., salir a buscar y casar  para comer.   y  no  tener desesperanza  buscar mil formas y ver que las cosas y el tiempo estan mezclados  y alli vienen  aunque uno las busque como queira vendran el amor y  laegrias  cosas que vienen y tambien el dolor y las pruebas duras cosas para ense?ar y  tener valor|`|d8897d1f14ff854a851c6d4600e9bc71aa	Pues echando toda mi ansiedad sobre Dios, sabiendo que tiene cuidado de mi, y encomendandolo todo a El, pues cada dia tiene su propio afan.

No la pones facil. Quiero decir que es buena pero demasiado amplia.<br>  <br>  Para mí, en particular, hay 2 tipos de problemas:<br>  <br>  Las peque?eces, es decir, esas tonterías que, cada una por sí misma no me preocupa, pero que cuando se vienen en tropel me desquician.<br>  <br>  Y los importantes, los que amenazan con destruir cosas o personas que quiero.<br>  <br>  Aunque parezca absurdo, son las peque?eces las que mas me descolocan y las que mayores sinsabores me causan<br>  <br>   Porque frente a un problema verdadero, sé que no me basto sola. Entonces tomo medidas como retirarme a orar y meditar sobre lo que debo hacer, y si encuentro que no está dentro de mis posibilidades resolverlo, se lo entrego a Dios con un "hágase tu voluntad" y me quedo en paz.<br>  <br>  En cambio con las peque?amolestias me ataca el pudor infantil de no "molestar a Dios con tonterias, bajo la guardia y termino irritándome y perdiendo la perspectiva.<br>  <br>  En todo caso, luego viene una etapa de reflexión en la que me pregunto qué puedo aprender de ésto.

No site is going to be able to compile 3000+ characters and their different shades of meaning.<br>  <br>  It would be best to find a person to teach you, or take a class - preferably with someone who has either grown up with the language or has studied it intensively.

FwueK3F9aa	The others are right in traditional shamanistic cultures a shaman is chosen because of his or her natural ability not anyone can become a shaman also if you are not of Native of shamanistic culture more than likely no shaman will train you.<br>  <br>  You could read up on or take a workshop in core shamanism. Which is really a generalization on the common practices of traditional shamanism in it's various forms from around the world. With core shamanism you would learn to journey to find your power anime for divination and to heal. It is not a native shamanism nor is it really based on such since it dose not attempt to recreate any particular shamanism tradition because that would be offensive if you started to mimic say a Native American tribes culture and traditions and called yourself a shaman.<br>  <br>  Best place to look is the man that coined the term Shamanism and reintroduced it to the west Michael Harner and his book “The Way of the Shaman” - www.shamanism.org/<br>  <br>  Here are also some great books that outline the basics of core shamanism and journeying.<br>  <br>  Sandra Ingerman "Shamanic Journeying: A Beginner's Guide"<br>  Thomas Cowan "Shamanism: As a Spiritual Practice for Daily Life"<br>  Katie Weatherup "Practical Shamanism: A guide for Walking in Both Worlds"<br>  <br>  Good luck on your journey. |`|JciP1Ts3aa	You definitely do not do it by searching the internet. |`|IPAdOJ4Naa	People discover in a wide variety of ways that their purpose in life is to become a shaman. Often potential healers have prophetic dreams about their future calling. The dream may even include details about locating a teacher and the length of the training. In some cases, people are led to shamanism through personal and private mystical experiences, while in other cases, they are drawn from the ranks of cured patients. The journey from apprentice to shaman is illustrated in the following example of Native American shamans.<br>  <br>  The first step is "embracing personal history." This process includes working through old traumas, fears, anger, hate, abandonment, betrayals, and wounds. The purpose is to heal the emotions so that one is no longer controlled by them but rather, consciously guided by feelings,....Web Searched your question,...take care,...|`|1apRagY9aa	Travel to Siberia or Alaska and talk to the tribal shaman. Most "shaman" or medicine men are chosen. One does not "become" a shaman. Or if you are looking for the new age neo-pagan version of a shaman, there are many books out there. Just go to Amazon.com and type in shamanism.

No sé que tenga que ver economía con la creencia o falta de creencia en dioses y religiones, particularmente cuando uno de los primeros modelos "comunistas" que se conocen es el "comunismo cristiano", previo a Marx.<br>  <br>  El comunismo no era, per se, ateo. Recuerda que en la revolución rusa, a uno de los primero grupos que eliminaron fueron a los ateos seguidores de Bakunin, esos eran ateos declarados y activistas. Originalmente se tuvo tolerancia a la iglesia ortodoxa, posteriormente durante el stalinismo, el partido comunista persiguió a la iglesia ortodoxa porque la consideraba una organización contraria a sus intereses, pero vale aclarar que el partido comunista persiguió a TODAS las organizaciones que consideraran un peligro a su proyecto político y social (totalitarismo). En otras palabras, durante el stalinismo se dedicaron a perseguir a la "religión organizada" y cualquier otra organización que consideraran contraria a sus ideales, pero posteriormente se restableció el derecho a la libertad de culto (alrededor de los 50's), aunque el Estado se mantuvo en un laicismo puro. Que no es lo mismo estár en contra de la religión organizada que estar en contra de las creencias en dioses. La religión organizada puede tener mucho poder político, piensa en la influencia histórica del Vaticano, los grupos cristianos en EE.UU., así como el legado de Rasputín en Rusia, como un hombre que influyó en las decisiones políticas de los zares.

Tu te estas refiriendo a que prohibian las creencias religiosas? porque en ese sistema se estilaba unicamente el servicio social sin ninguna bandera de caracter religioso?. Porque en si, las teorias de los pensadores del comunismo como Kant, Hegel, Marks, etc. eran pensadores , cuya racionalidad y analisis les hizo recomponer la sociedad , mediante un sistema que si bien no funciono y no funciona, es porque no satistizo, ni satisface a cabalidad, las necesidades de la sociedad en lo particular. Se les olvido incorporar un componente necesario en sociedades avanzadas, cultas que es la iniciativa privada y su interaccion con el conjunto de factores sociales restantes. Pero no porque era ateo. En escencia no era ateo. Carlos Marks en su materialismo dialectico, pregonaba a la actividad del hombre como una contribucion para los demas en una vision de caracter social y estrictamente de resultados practicos , donde todos se entrelazaba para que el resultado , fuera una sociedad prospera e incluyente. Lo que paso con la creencia en Dios , fue que no lo tomaba en cuenta porque se enfocaban a satisfaces las necesidades fisicas de la sociedad. Actualmente en el capitalismo se recoge el fracazo social del comunismo pero se incorpora como parte de la sociedad tambien, pero como un componente que a un nivel social, nutre y suple las deficiencias del capital. En EUA se puede observar esto muy facilmente, hay programas sociales que ni en los mas fanaticos paises comunistas existen. Eso es precisamente lo que debe pasar en Mexico y en el resto de paises latinoamericanos. Un capital, actuante para producir riqueza que se reparte a todo el panorama social en forma de trabajos, sueldos satisfactores , vivienda facilidades de creditos, iniciativa privada pues. No que en nuestros paises los ricos son los ricos y los pobres cada vez mas pobres.

SDHvDNGJaa	Creo que todas las épocas tienen sus ventajas y desventajas. Para las mujeres liberadas, los 60's fueron una época de represión sexual. Para los estudiantes, recuerden que en 1968 hubo varios problemas en el mundo, en México ser estudiante era un delito y sucedió la matanza de Tlatelolco. La falta de libertad social era muy notoria. Sucedió también el movimiento de los ****** en EU, la muerte de Martin Luther King. En 1963 sucedió el asesinato de John F. Kennedy. Hubo el aplastamiento de los intentos libertarios de muchos países de América Latina, no solamente fueron Beatles, Rolling Stones y rock, fue una época con grandes movimientos que fueron reprimidos. No me hubiera gustado ser estudiante en el 68... También hubo sucesos como el de Canoa, el surgimiento de muchas dictaduras militares en América Latina, ser comunista era ser un peligro para la humanidad, etc|`|09e4a235e55842860dfd5d0bd8dd2750aa	no , la mejor epoca fueron los 80s|`|6b2b00223f74837565b8efb0f49609aeaa	fue una buena época, pero si sabes disfrutar de la vida, todos los tiempos tienen sus encantos y son lindos.-|`|c061efab456c59d31940c205f82b44b1aa	Para mi tambien la decada del 60 y70 fueron las mejores y yo tampoco la vivi (hablando de música)|`|FaaJJbSXaa	Creo como algo muy personal q las décadas mejores son las q se tiene la experiencia de vivir y disfrutar y x ello se siente q cada quien ha vivido mejores épocas|`|QZ3nB3hLaa	Definitivamente debió ser una época única.

Pity has its roots in fear and carries a sense of arrogance and condescension, sometimes even a smug feeling of “I’m glad it’s not me.” As Stephen Levine says: “When your fear touches someone’s pain it becomes pity; when your love touches someone’s pain, it becomes compassion.” To train in compassion is to know that all beings are the same and suffer in similar ways, to honor all those who suffer, and to know that you are neither separate from nor superior to anyone."|`|angW1Lkfaa	I have a boy with a mental illness and and most of these kids with a disability  have more heart then the kids that want to tease, but them down and break their spirits, enough said.|`|cusngBDQaa	i have a sort of lisp .<br>  <br>  yeah, i'm disabled like that so technically i'm a person with disabilities.|`|AA10119874	I hope you remember that some disabilities are not visible.|`|D6BRPzr7aa	nothing.... just other normal people<br>  <br>  because the more you put feelings on them, the more they felt pity for themselves....|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Don't bother me, whatsoever.

Now days, we have The Schwan Man stop by ever so often in his refrigerated truck with all kinds of food and deserts in the freezer on wheels that he drives.

I remember tho, when I was in basic<br>  training in the army, there was one allowed on the base, and he would<br>  come through once a week, and we were allowed to run down and<br>  buy some, when we heard the calliope music. It was a nice treat if<br>  we had the money to buy something. The money we earned back<br>  then was very little. So it didn't stretch too far. I think it was only $75.00 a month back in '62.  But the thrill of the trucks' arrival, brought<br>  out the 'kid' in all of us, as we'd run down those stairs to greet him LOL.<br>     And when I lived in San Jose thirty years later, when the ice cream<br>  truck started coming through our neighborhood, and even during the<br>  winter months, there I'd be, waiting on the curb so often, waiting for<br>  that treat, that seemed extra special, just because it was from the<br>  'ice cream man'.

Once when my oldest daughter    was about 5  whenever she heard the ice cream man, no matter how far away he was, she'd rush in get her money and stand at the end of the driveway with her little arm raised until he came no matter how long it took. She would be holding one arm up with the other her arms would get so tired. I tried to explain to her that he didn't need to do that until the ice cream man was close enough to see her, but she was terrified he would miss her. That's one of my precious memories.|`|6ozmjp3xaa	Short stuff that's not fair we still are having winter up here in the north, and we wont see an ice cream truck till June<br>  When I was a kid we lived way out in the country, and there was no "Good Humor" man there, but sometimes I would be at my older sisters house in the city, oh what a treat, hearing those happy tunes|`|XVZMXBwNaa	There used to be one that came into our neighborhood, but have not had any around here in a while,. Due to all the fees, and license requirements the city has put most of them out of business.<br>  Yes, when I was a kid the Ice Cream man used to come down our block and we would all rush outside to get an Ice cream. Remember <br>  the creamsicle bars. It was orange with vanilla ice cream in the middle. <br>  Missles, and fudge bars and of course the drumsticks.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	I have not heard the ice cream truck in several years.  I think (my)  city government stopped them because it was easier to stop kids from running across the street to the truck than it is to stop some guy with noisy pipes who wants us all to be aware of how cool his car sounds.  They banned the ice cream trucks because even in the quiet neighborhoods, the kids were in danger from inattentive drivers.  How sad!|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	Every day during the summer it  goes down our street. I lived in the country and frankly I don't think any city in our state had ice cream trucks in the 60's. While visiting my aunt in Torrance Calif. back then she had one and I remember it sas the first one I had ever seen.|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Yes, as a child that was a big deal to hear the music playing blocks away and getting so excited waiting for the truck to appear. I guess it's been 12 years now since I've seen an ice cream truck. Thanks for the memory.?|`|LQ52bOFFaa	I see him frequently.  He works year round in my town in Arizona.  He's an independent.

They go door to door.|`|4M9gnZMDaa	this past summer|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I think last year end of September or first part of October, didn't come around all spring or summer because of the high cost of gas. I hate the creepy music, a manic speed of pop goes the weasel and other songs.  I did see a Mexican man pushing a hand-cart and ringing a bell up in a Hispanic neighborhood a couple years ago, guess that is the way to sell ice cream if the price of gas goes up again.     My daughter used to chase the ice cream down the street every day when we lived in an apartment complex, she was 6 or 7 years old. Most of the time she didn't have any money but she chased it any way. They usually sold ice-crusted popsicles and tiny portions of ice cream, I would take her to Braums and buy some good ice cream for the same money the nasty stuff cost.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I applied to drive a Dumbo Ice Cream Truck. But I found out that they only paid 30 per cent commission and I had to buy my fuel and dry ice. So instead, in that spring of 1975 I started my own company driving an ice cream truck. <br>  <br>  I had a 20’ long step van and a large push down window on the passenger side. I mounted a large school house bell on the driver’s side of the van. I bought a new non-working deep freezer and put the freezer on its back in the van. <br>  <br>  I bought ice cream novelties: Various flavored popsicles, fudge bars, bomb pops, ice cream sandwiches, drumsticks, chocolate crunch bars and strawberry crunch bars and soda pop.  I bought dry ice to keep the products frozen. I would start around 10 am and drive until dusk.  I’d ring that bell driving very slowly down a residential street.  <br>  <br>  I marked up the products 500 per cent. (Example: popsicles cost 3 cents each, I sold each for 15 cents, fudge bars cost 3 cents a piece, sold for 20 cents each. Ice cream sandwiches cost 10 cents and I sold them for 50 cents.)  On good days, I could gross $100 to $150 a day.  <br>  <br>  Less overhead and I netted about 75 to 80 per cent.  There were lots of bad days where I barely made costs. But overall it was a good part time gig that earned me enough money to continue college in the fall. I made more money than most students did for summer.|`|LcURWscBaa	They still go around in the city.  Thankfully I don't have to listen to it now that I've moved into a senior community.  I didn't mind hearing the truck and the music, but sometimes he would park in front of my house for up to an hour at a time with the music still playing, and then it got old in a hurry.|`|n7P70gweaa	I hear the Ice Cream truck almost every day.<br>  I take my dog to a dog park that is attached to a public park and even now, in the "dead of winter", the truck pulls in and plays his happy tune for 15 minutes every day.<br>  It's gotten to the point where even the dogs go to the fence and watch him.|`|3ku5N8tOaa	All I hear is the birds and the wind in the trees. No self respecting ice cream vendor would come up here.  I do remember as a child running to catch up with the ice cream truck, begging my father for a dime. Haven't ever thought of that until now. Thanks for the memory.|`|AA11100707	I moved to my current neighborhood in Northern Va. just outside of DC in June 06<br>  <br>  I was SO amazed to hear the icecream truck come ding a lingin' outside my windows one day!

b3TljD0Laa	A pun is when someone says something like "Frankly, I like hot dogs". They are using two words that mean the same thing in one sentence (Frank (frankfurt) and hot dog) Puns are usually really lame jokes. xo]<br>  <br>  and if someone says something like a pun, but they didn't mean to try and make a joke, then they say "no pun intended", and the opposite for pun intended.<br>  <br>  Here are some more examples of puns:<br>  <a href="http://www.punoftheday.com/cgi-bin/disppuns.pl?ord=F&cat=0&sub=0&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.punoftheday.com/cgi-bin/dispp...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|kZ6N5odXaa	If my name was Ruby and someone said, "Ruby, you're a jewel! No pun intended!" The that person WASN'T meaning to make a pun (deliberately exploit ambiguity between similar-sounding words for humorous or rhetorical effect; so what that person said is a pun because Ruby is a type of jewel) about my name but that person realized and said it wasn't a pun.<br>  <br>  If that person had said pun intended, the person meant to make the pun and wants you to know.<br>  <br>  To sum it up: no pun intended - didn't mean to make the pun<br>  pun intended - they knew they were making a pun and were most likely trying to be funny|`|2zuVrxFjaa	Okay i can only explain by example.. So let's say you say: I continually asked the track coach about joining the team but he just kept giving me the run-around.<br>  .....get it cause it's track and he gives her a run-around and in track you run around but it also means to avoid a question or avoid giving a true answer.<br>  <br>  Well if you are being serious and realize what you've just said can be misleading because it's a pun you would say: No pun intended. Meaning you didn't mean for that to sound funny.<br>  <br>  make sense :S? it's hard to explain|`|dfBYe4Vyaa	a pun is using word play to be funny<br>  <br>  example:<br>  I continually asked the track coach about joining the team but he just kept giving me the run-around.<br>  <br>  the coach gives him the 'run-around' and this is funny because it refers to running and he is the coach of the track team<br>  <br>  he could of said the coach just avoided saying whether or not he could join, but he decided to be funny about it<br>  <br>  <br>  no pun intended is when you are being serious about something but the way you say it calls for you to add 'no pun intended', even though most of the time whats being sad is still funny|`|i0bFgktUaa	a pun is a play on words (when you say a word that relates to the topic of your sentence)<br>  like,<br>  <br>  "A fight broke out in a kitchen. Egged on by the waiters, two cooks peppered each other with punches."<br>  <br>  since the fight is in the kitchen using the words egg and pepper (egged and peppered) are puns.<br>  no pun intended means they didn't mean to make a pun when they said they're sentence|`|4qmqN18Laa	here's an example of that.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061208070848AA2lAVj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  or this:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071204083548AA20Gwv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  I think they're very clear.

When the pun is intended, the person is trying to make a joke.  So like this morning on TV some one was talking about a tornado and a "storm cellar" and I said "I wonder how much money they make" and mu husband said "who" and I said "Storm Sellers" (as though you could sell storms for a living).   That wasn't a particularly funny pun, but it WAS intended.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people say things like that and they don't realize what they said until afterwards so they'll usually say "No pun intended", meaning they were not trying to make a joke.<br>  <br>  Hubby just came in and told me an unintended pun.  He's watching a documentary on law enforcement trying to find marijuana growers and they said "it's a joint operation".  That pun was certainly not intended.|`|dMv9y8MWaa	No pun intended means they're not trying to be funny.<br>  Pun intended means it's supposed to be funny.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

It was first published in Latin and French in 1992 by the authority of Pope John Paul II. The volume has been translated into many other languages, including English. In 1997, a Latin text was issued which is now the official text of reference, the contents of the first French text being amended at a few points.<br>  <br>  The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005, and the first edition in English in 2006.

g0gMQUCVaa	You know, I was always taught the same.  It does seem that there is no justice sometimes.  That the good, honest people get nowhere while the evil just get stronger and more prosperous.<br>  <br>  But, we don't see their whole lives.  We don't know the private hells they may be going through in other aspects of their lives.  One thing that I know for sure is that I can sleep in good conscience every night.  I know that I trust the Lord.  <br>  <br>  The evil don't trust the Lord and there will be a final reckoning, I believe.

Satan does tempt us by exposing us to people who are evil and seem to have everything that they could want. They may have much in earthly possessions but without the love of God all wealth is fleeting. That is, it may be here today and gone tomorrow. Saton is clever and knows your weaknesses and depends on your weaknesses to provide the possibility of owning your soul. I once knew a man with wealth that knew no limits. This same man told me that the two things that he wanted most could not be bought with money. I believe God was showing him the importance of money. This man owned skyscrapers in San Antonio, Texas and he was regarded as a extremely wealthy man. Don't fall into the trap that is set for those whose faith is weak. Stay with us, God's children. True riches are those that you feel and cannot see. Wealth is of no value when you need the love of God. It is free, and can be easily found, if you get down on your knees to look for it.|`|KWwW7N49aa	I haven't found this saying to be in the Scriptures.

But the evil people, the liars and cheats are the ones who prosper. So rarely are they actually punished that it makes one wonder about the Good Book. But we have not made it to the gates of heaven when we stand at the hand of God and he reads the list of things we have done during out life. This is how I think we will or will not be going through into Heaven or the other way for all those who have the long list of bad things they have done. I choose to be a good person all the time for my own peace of mind right here on earth.  It is sad and frustrating to see the bad people get so rich and I worry about a loaf of bread or heat to stay warm.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	There is a payday for everyone. Just because we can't see them getting justice doesn't mean it won't happen in other ways.. Have seen some truly evil people pay themselves back.  There is a good book called "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind",  our subconscious mind knows when we deliberately do something bad, and it never forgets. I know someone personally  who hot-footed it  to the police station and confessed to some crimes, he knew deep down he was guilty and got scared because he thought he would get in deeper trouble by another authority if he didn't tell, and thought the local police would offer him immunity.

That has nothing to do with God.<br>  <br>  This is man's technology that has advanced over years, to be able to use machines and medicine to bring someone who has suddenly died, back to life again. That is because the body that died temporarily still has the ability to re-function again if certain machines and medication is used very quickly to revive such ones.<br>  <br>  Other than that, when we die, many of us do not come back and thus go back to the ground, the clay in which we came from.<br>  <br>  God does not "pick the flowers" from earth that he wants to come be with him in heaven. That is another false teaching to "make things feel better" to the one who has lost a loved one [in death], though false teachings are one of Satan's biggest tools he uses to fool the masses.<br>  <br>  When we die, we go back to our ground and our thoughts do perish. We have inherited death from our ancestors, Adam and Eve, and their (including Noah's) offspring. We have inherited these genes from our former ancestors. <br>  <br>  Like I mentioned above, there are exceptions with proper timing, medication, skills, and machinery -- proper advanced technology, but outside of those things, we cannot help that some day we will die.<br>  ----------------------------<br>  <br>  “In this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.” That comment, penned in 1789 by American statesman Benjamin Franklin, has struck some as clever. <br>  <br>  However, many dishonest people cheat on their taxes. <br>  <br>  Death seems far more certain. <br>  <br>  On our own, none of us can avoid it in the long run. It pursues us all. (Proverbs 27:20) But consider a comforting thought. Jehovah’s Word gives the sure hope of the resurrection, of being raised to life once again [after Armageddon]. This is no mere dream, and no force in the universe can prevent Jehovah from making this hope a reality. For some, though, death is less certain than many today realize. Why? Because an unnumbered “great crowd” will survive “the great tribulation,” soon to come. (Revelation 7:9, 10, 14) They will live on afterward, with eternity in view. Thus, death is no certainty for them. Moreover, “death is to be brought to nothing.” (1?Corinthians 15:26)<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5:<br>  <br>  For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.<br>  <br>  We can look forward to Armageddon, for at that time, only God will resurrect those that are deserving, and both the righteous and unrighteous will be resurrected after Armageddon --- on a gradual, orderly level. We must wait and see... I hope I am part of the living after Armageddon... I have hope..|`|KWwW7N49aa	Because it wasn't his time.

My hubby at the time didn't have a grandson..but now we do, we raised him for four years, none of that would have been possible if hubby was dead. I would have had to go to work, then I wouldn't have been able to be there for this child. He still needs us...he has been taken away from us by his parents now...he is sad ...we are sad...so I ask God..why did you give him to us to have him taken away? Why did you have hubby live so that hubby and I were there for this child? Why? Why? Why?

And I don't quite understand why someone would be brought up not to introduce men?   Perhaps you could respond to his response with something like "It's rude of you to give someone my personal information without my permission."  Surely his mama never told him to insist on being offensive.   Someone, however, should either introduce the newcomer to everyone -- male and female -- in the group, or else ask, "Do you know everyone?" or "Does everyone know (Name)?" so that you all can introduce yourselves.  Maybe you could speak up first next time.|`|S4zNEAFJaa	I would be offended if someone were to not introduce me.

8G42oyydaa	Keep it, have someone come in and do an assay, if there is oil or diamonds, both common in Northern Canada lease it to an oil or mining company and collect "royalties" or whatever its called, on the resources extracted.<br>  <br>   Do NOT sell !!! Mineral rights are a thing of the past and you could be sitting on a motherlode. Tell the kids to go make their own money, you wont get anything near what it could actually be worth or whatever is under the ground is worth. <br>  <br>  Do the assay, I hope thats the right word, too lazy to google it today Dont let the mining company do it.<br>  <br>  Also you can sell the standing timber to a company that will come in and harvest it and restore and replant.  <br>  <br>  Its a goldmine, it would be foolish to sell IMO  My exe got paid $80,000.00 for the timber on some land he inherited for a one time small harvest. <br>  <br>  Remember Canada's standing timber has been depleted by the pine beetle and its a scarce resource in Western Canada now, and diamonds are not only a girls best friend, they are woth a helluva lot of money, so is oil ! Even potash can bring in a nice income for you.|`|syIp6d2Naa	If you have the land assayed for mineral, oil, or natural gas be sure it's a honest company. We had land in the family and there was oil on it but the company was crooked and they said there wasn't enough to make it worth any ones time to drill. Then they did what was called slant drilling and by the time the family knew what was going on there wasn't anything left. Of course the lawsuit was tied up for over fifteen years and and the family finally just cut their losses and sold the land for almost nothing. At least the area hasn't been developed so that's a little solace.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	What ever pleases you.  I would investigate to learn if  Canada has what we call, in the United States, a Federal Trust. A Federal Trust allows someone in your family to manage the trust each generation but no one ever can sell it and spend the money.  Ownership of that property may, in the future, become extremely valuable.  If there is timber on the property you might consider harvesting the timber or better yet, thinning the timber.  That might produce much more than you anticipate.  If you sell the property there is a possibility that within a generation your family will become owners and possessors of  average wealth, That  may not be all that much some day. Consider the investments that you could make if you sell and remind yourself of the losses that even the most astute investor is sustaining currently. Don;t sell your land. That is bottom line.  Don't encumber your land.  Add that to the bottom line. If you are not wealthy, consider your past financial performance and choose wisely this one time in your life.  Liquid assets are not safely kept, ever. The degree of access to your land is important. If easily reached from a public thoroughfare the land is more valuable.  If in the future access is improved it could double, at least in value. Good luck. Don't get in a hurry.  Haste makes waste.|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	My God!

I'm guessing oil or natural gas is the mineral<br>  they're after. They drill. If they hit, then they build some sort of a gas or oil<br>  collection station. They attend to it almost daily, as the Gov't. regulates<br>  extraction rates. When the resource is gone, they close it up, but usually<br>  retain the rights in case somebody finds a way to get more out.<br>  Consider it trapping rights for underground.<br>  I'd go for it, but not just now. Energy is in the doldrums.<br>  Meanwhile, talk to people who have leased the mineral rights. Find out the pros and cons.<br>  You will develop a short list of "this I want" things<br>  -no environmental sloppiness (check out Company record on this)<br>  -if no exploration within x years, lease lapses and ownership reverts to you<br>  -above all, if and when you decide to lease, get a good lawyer.<br>  Your chats with people who have leased will prove to be invaluable.<br>  Lastly, if they say "sign now, this offer is not good forever", walk away.<br>  The minerals are good forever, and somebody will always want it.<br>  <br>  If the mineral they're after is something like potash or<br>  copper, then this is probably an open pit type of operation. There goes the landscape !!|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	I would hang on to it for a while.  Like Paul N said, thin out the timber.  Quite a bit of money to be had there.  With that much acreage a tidy sum from the sale of thinning the timber out would be a nice little nest egg.  Another answer said that there could be gold or other precious minerals on it.  My dad drilled it into my head that land will always be an asset that will earn you a far better return than many other investments.<br>  Just think on it a while, it's been there for a long time.  A few more years may make a world of difference.<br>  Like your avitar name, you are a very lucky lady:-)|`|wy5SiCS2aa	hmm that's hard. I would probably sell, because you probably have no intent of actually trying to develop the land to live on or anything.

JF8UFCIKaa	I had nuns for 12 years, and I have nothing but fond memories of them all.  I remember them tying up their habits in a big knot so they could jump rope with us, of one hitting a baseball out of the playground, of them hiding candy bars up their sleeves and giggling about it, of scratching an itch under their huge head covering with a ruler, of several  chasing another nun with a measuring tape to see if she really had an 18 inch waist, and of them being the best, most loving teachers I ever had.  The only teacher I was afraid of, and who hit me with a ruler, was a lay teacher.  The sisters were just regular people, who happened to have a special calling. There was one sister who was taunted by the students.  I came into the class early one day to see her crying.  I wish those girls knew how they hurt her feelings.<br>   I decided to be a teacher early on in life because of their positive influence.|`|KH331jojaa	At Aberdeen Sheriff Court, Sheriff Colin Harris told the nun the only appropriate sentence was to admonish her on each of the four charges. The sentence means she will receive no further punishment beyond having a criminal record.<br>  <br>  Jeanette Adams, 41 - Docherty was found guilty of hitting her with a hairbrush and force-feeding her - said: "I am really disgusted by this. She is going back to work with old people... She could not care years ago when we were there."<br>  <br>  Agnes Fowler, who claimed to have been a victim of the nun, said: "I think it is a damn disgrace, because if that had been anyone else they would have got a custodial sentence straight away. Admonishing her is calling us all liars." Mrs Fowler said she feared the sentence would deter abused children from speaking out.<br>  <br>  Dozens of other alleged victims had come forward since the conviction. At the start of the five-week trial the nun faced 23 charges of cruel and unnatural treatment against the children, but two were dropped during the trial, the jury were directed to acquit her of 14, and three were not proven.<br>  <br>  Sentencing Docherty, Sheriff Harris said the fact that the nun was a young woman when the offences were committed and that she was a first offender, and her health and life of service, had prevented him from jailing her. He said a sentence of community service or a fine would have been inappropriate. "In due weight of the mitigating factors I have before me today, I can deal with sentence today and I can admonish you of each of these four charges."<br>  <br>  After the case Docherty's solicitor, Jim Hay, made a statement on her behalf. "Had it not been for this prosecution Sister Marie [Docherty] would have continued her life of service to the elderly, the sick and the dying. Sister Marie has been of exemplary character and the sentence of the court amply reflects this," he said.<br>  <br>  The court had listened to a catalogue of abuse involving the nun. She was convicted of hitting Helen Cusiter, 43, with a fist or hairbrush and repeatedly force-feeding her.<br>  <br>  She was found guilty of hitting Ms Adams with a hairbrush and force-feeding her. Patricia O'Brien, 44, was punched and slapped and on one occasion pushed against a radiator.<br>  <br>  Docherty was also found guilty of throwing dirty underwear at Grace Montgomery, 37, and force-feeding her sweets.<br>  <br>  The nun left court in silence with her head bowed and was driven away in a car. One of her victims shouted out: "I hope you rot in hell."|`|AA10824838	I went to catholic school for 12 yrs.  During high school, there were not many that were teachers.

My 8th grade nun was really cool and I really thought highly of her.  I think she even inspired me to enter the convent, even though it was a different order.  I went to a public high school but my friends knew I wanted to be a nun and they called me Sr. Betrile, or The Flying Nun.  I did enter the convent after high school but it only lasted 3 months.

However, most African governments simply don't have the resources to fund generous public programs like WIC, or social security disabllity, If you are that worried about starving children why not give a little money/ time to charities both home and abroad?|`|9GzTuwhXaa	Well, I think that there shouldn't be a limit to how much charity work we do.

6437rYNNaa	Read Acts 16:33 and Acts 2:39|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	Infant baptism is absolutely Biblical.  So is sprinkling. But it is shown through a weight of biblical evidence rather than verse-mining.|`|hvNqywbBaa	Biblical and Traditional<br>  <br>  When Scripture talks about baptizing the whole family, they didn't exclude the infants.<br>  <br>  Gen. 17:12, Lev. 12:3 - these texts show the circumcision of eight-day old babies as the way of entering into the Old Covenant - Col 2:11-12 - however, baptism is the new "circumcision" for all people of the New Covenant. Therefore, baptism is for babies as well as adults. God did not make His new Covenant narrower than the old Covenant. To the contrary, He made it wider, for both Jews and Gentiles, infants and adults.<br>  <br>  Psalm 51:5 - we are conceived in the iniquity of sin. This shows the necessity of baptism from conception. <br>  <br>  Matt. 18:2-5 - Jesus says unless we become like children, we cannot enter into heaven. So why would children be excluded from baptism? <br>  <br>  Matt 19:14 - Jesus clearly says the kingdom of heaven also belongs to children. There is no age limit on entering the kingdom, and no age limit for being eligible for baptism. <br>  <br>  Mark 10:14 - Jesus says to let the children come to Him for the kingdom of God also belongs to them. Jesus says nothing about being too young to come into the kingdom of God. <br>  <br>  Mark 16:16 - Jesus says to the crowd, "He who believes and is baptized will be saved." But in reference to the same people, Jesus immediately follows with "He who does not believe will be condemned." This demonstrates that one can be baptized and still not be a believer. This disproves the Protestant argument that one must be a believer to be baptized. There is nothing in the Bible about a "believer's baptism." <br>  <br>  Luke 18:15 – Jesus says, “Let the children come to me.” The people brought infants to Jesus that he might touch them. This demonstrates that the receipt of grace is not dependent upon the age of reason. <br>  <br>  Acts 2:38 - Peter says to the multitude, "Repent and be baptized.." Protestants use this verse to prove one must be a believer (not an infant) to be baptized. But the Greek translation literally says, "If you repent, then each one who is a part of you and yours must each be baptized” .This, contrary to what Protestants argue, actually proves that babies are baptized based on their parents’ faith. This is confirmed in the next verse. <br>  <br>  Acts 2:39 - Peter then says baptism is specifically given to children as well as adults. “Those far off” refers to those who were at their “homes” (primarily infants and children). God's covenant family includes children. The word "children" that Peter used comes from the Greek word "teknon" which also includes infants. <br>  <br>  Luke 1:59 - this proves that "teknon" includes infants. Here, John as a "teknon" (infant) was circumcised. See also Acts 21:21 which uses “teknon” for eight-day old babies. So baptism is for infants as well as adults. <br>  <br>  Acts 10:47-48 - Peter baptized the entire house of Cornelius, which generally included infants and young children. There is not one word in Scripture about baptism being limited to adults. <br>  <br>  Acts 16:15 - Paul baptized Lydia and her entire household. The word "household" comes from the Greek word "oikos" which is a household that includes infants and children. <br>  <br>  Acts 16:15 - further, Paul baptizes the household based on Lydia's faith, not the faith of the members of the household. This demonstrates that parents can present their children for baptism based on the parents' faith, not the children's faith. <br>  <br>  Acts 16:30-33 - it was only the adults who were candidates for baptism that had to profess a belief in Jesus. This is consistent with the Church's practice of instructing catechumens before baptism. But this verse does not support a "believer's baptism" requirement for everyone. See Acts 16:15,33. The earlier one comes to baptism, the better. For those who come to baptism as adults, the Church has always required them to profess their belief in Christ. For babies who come to baptism, the Church has always required the parents to profess the belief in Christ on behalf of the baby. But there is nothing in the Scriptures about a requirement for ALL baptism candidates to profess their own belief in Christ (because the Church has baptized babies for 2,000 years). <br>  <br>  Acts 16:33 - Paul baptized the jailer (an adult) and his entire household (which had to include children). Baptism is never limited to adults and those of the age of reason. See also Luke 19:9; John 4:53; Acts 11:14; 1 Cor. 1:16; and 1 Tim. 3:12; Gen. 31:41; 36:6; 41:51; Joshua 24:15; 2 Sam. 7:11, 1 Chron. 10:6 which shows “oikos” generally includes children. <br>  <br>  Rom. 5:12 - sin came through Adam and death through sin. Babies' souls are affected by Adam's sin and need baptism just like adult souls. <br>  <br>  Rom. 5:15 - the grace of Jesus Christ surpasses that of the Old Covenant. So children can also enter the new Covenant in baptism. From a Jewish perspective, it would have been unthinkable to exclude infants and children from God's Covenant kingdom. <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 1:16 - Paul baptized the household ("oikos") of Stephanus. Baptism is not limited to adults. <br>  <br>  Eph. 1:1; Col. 1:2 - Paul addresses the "saints" of the Church, and these include the children he addresses in Eph. 6:1 and Col. 3:20. Children become saints of the Church only through baptism. <br>  <br>  Eph. 2:3 - we are all by nature children of wrath, in sin, like all mankind. Infants are no exception. See also Psalm 51:5 and Job 14:1-4 which teach us we are conceived in sin and born unclean. <br>  <br>  2 Thess. 3:10 - if anyone does not work let him not eat. But this implies that those who are unable to work should still be able to eat. Babies should not starve because they are unable to work, and should also not be denied baptism because they are unable to make a declaration of faith. <br>  <br>  Matt. 9:2; Mark 2:3-5 - the faith of those who brought in the paralytic cured the paralytic's sins. This is an example of the forgiveness of sins based on another's faith, just like infant baptism. The infant child is forgiven of sin based on the parents' faith. <br>  <br>  Matt. 8:5-13 - the servant is healed based upon the centurion's faith. This is another example of healing based on another's faith. If Jesus can heal us based on someone else’s faith, then He can baptize us based on someone else’s faith as well. <br>  <br>  Mark 9:22-25 - Jesus exercises the child's unclean spirit based on the father's faith. This healing is again based on another's faith. <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 7:14 – Paul says that children are sanctified by God through the belief of only one of their parents. <br>  <br>  Exodus 12:24-28 - the Passover was based on the parent's faith. If they did not kill and eat the lamb, their first-born child died. <br>  <br>  Joshua 5:2-7 - God punished Israel because the people had not circumcised their children. This was based on the parent's faith. The parents play a critical role in their child's salvation.|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	Doesn't it depend on how long you hold the kid's head under ?|`|GBjMqElBaa	I agree with you, and offer further evidence for your case. See for yourself what some learned people have said:<br>  <br>  BAPTISM - IS IT A WORK OF GOD OR A WORK OF MAN?<br>  <br>  Below are some common objections to the Biblical teaching of God's saving power in baptism. Each is followed by a Scripture-based rebuttal.<br>  <br>  Objection  then Rebuttal <br>  1. Isn't joining the church an act of a person who decides to believe in Jesus, and not based on a mere ritual like baptism? <br>  <br>  The Church is not like a club, made up of individuals who on their own decide to join (1 Cor. 2:12-14), but is a family established by its head Jesus Christ (Gal. 4:5; Eph. 1:5), a new community resulting from His Spirit's call (Jn. 3:5; 15:16; 1 Cor. 12:3). God's action always precedes the existence of faith in any individual, regardless of age. <br>  <br>  2. Baptism in the Spirit is the only regenerating baptism. Water baptism accomplishes nothing special. <br>  <br>  The distinction is artificial. Christian baptism is baptism in the Spirit! What God has joined together we are not to put asunder. The Spirit comes to us enveloped in baptism's waters (Jn. 3:5; Titus 3:5). Peter states clearly that through baptism the gift of the Spirit is given (Acts 2:33).  <br>  <br>  3. If infants should be baptized, why doesn't the Bible say so?<br>  <br>   What is assumed need not always be expressed. The Bible always includes infants and families in its understanding of "nations" (Ex. 11:5; Josh. 8:35; Isa. 13:16; Ezek. 9:6).Jesus did not condemn Judaism for circumcising 8-day-old children, or baptizing the infants of those who converted to Judaism.  <br>  <br>  4. Since adults are first taught, then baptized, doesn't the same rule apply to infants and children?<br>  <br>   Jesus's command to disciple all nations coordinates teaching and baptism, but does not specify sequence. The order makes sense with adults but cannot be used as the reason against baptizing infants. To assume this is to hold the error that a person contributes to his salvation through offering some type of rational thought. Infants are baptized with the purpose that they enter into Christ's church for a life-long learning of His Word (2 Pet. 3:18)! <br>  <br>  5. Isn't the baptizing of infants a denial of the necessity of faith? <br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit desires to create faith in all. He can come even to a child in the womb (Jer. 1:5; Lk. 1:15). He also comes in baptism's water to bestow faith in infants and children (Ps. 22:9-10; Matt. 21:15-16). <br>  <br>  6. A child is not worthy to be baptized because he/she has not made a conscious regardless of age, infants or adults, is worthy of God's gracious activity, nor is able and firm declaration of faith. <br>  <br>  Saving faith is never self-centered or self-originated. No one, to accept God or create his/her own faith (1 Cor. 2:14; Rom. 8:7; 9:16). But what is impossible for all people, including infants, children, and adults, is possible with God (Matt. 19:26).  <br>  <br>  7. Baptism should be limited to those who have reached the "age of accountability?' <br>  <br>   There is no Biblical statement for waiting until such an age. Accountability before God begins at conception (Ps. 51:5; 58:3; Jn. 3:6). Baptism is like the Old Testament rite of circumcision, and Jewish children were circumcised when just eight days old. <br>   <br>  8. Isn't it enough that infants and children are simply "presented" or "dedicated to God," asking for His blessing upon them? <br>  <br>   Jesus did not command us to do just these, but to baptize "all nations?' Infant "dedication" or "presentation" does not carry with it the divine promise of the Holy Spirit and forgiveness, as does baptism (Acts 2:38). <br>  <br>  9. Aren't infants and children of believing parents already sanctified (1 Cor. 7:14) and therefore not in need of baptism?<br>  <br>   While Jewish boys were born "in holiness:' they still had to be circumcised on the eighth day after birth. Christ says that infants are an example of how to receive God's kingdom (Mk. 10:15). Only by bringing them to baptism can we be sure that infants have been given Christ's kingdom (Rom. 6:3), and are under the influence of the Holy Spirit, who sanctifies through water and Word (Jn. 3:5).  <br>  <br>  10. If baptism is so powerful, then why do so many who were baptized as infants no longer live an active Christian life? <br>  <br>  Human unfaithfulness (for example, the children of Israel during the forty years in the wilderness) does not negate God's faithfulness (Rom. 3:1-4). Scripture teaches that believers can and do at times wander away from the faith (Matt. 13:5-7, 19-22).  <br>  <br>  11. Since the thief on the cross was saved without baptism, baptism is not necessary to salvation.<br>  <br>   We cannot assume that the thief wasn't baptized, since John the Baptizer baptized a great number of Jews in and around Jerusalem (Jn. 3:23; Matt. 3:5). Only unbelief damns; not the lack of baptism. If not being baptized is symptomatic of a person's rejecting the promises of God's Word, then that person is in spiritual danger (Lk. 7:30). <br>  <br>  12. Isn't baptizing infants giving the wrong impression of believing in "magical" water?|`|GC3qn1Aeaa	Your position is closely allied with Martin Luther, who opposed the Anabaptists (re-baptists) who said that only adult believers should be baptized.  In my mind, the matter has to do with Church authority.  Infant baptism is a by proxy act that depends upon the faith of the parents.  The Church acts as the instrument of God's will on behalf of the child in this case.  This is something Martin Luther never questioned, though many Protestant denominations ended up siding with the Anabaptists.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, the only way to settle the issue is to say that water baptism, as a sacramental act, means nothing.  But it's hard to do away with it.    Jesus himself was baptized "to fulfill all righteousness."  It is clear, however, that the baptism of the Holy Spirit (and the baptism of fire) are more important (Matt. 3:11, Mark 1:8, Luke 3:16, John 1:33, Acts 1:5, Acts 11:16).  In the book of Acts, we see the apostles laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Spirit.  We also see them baptizing in water; and there's at least one example of some believers who had been baptized in water, but didn't even know about Jesus Christ!  (Acts 19).  Water baptism, after all, was instituted by John as an act of repentance preliminary to the coming of the Christ.  But the Bible declares that Jesus himself, and his disciples, as well as John and his disciples continued baptizing people in water for some time.  So the issue is not easily settled by the scriptures.<br>  <br>  I once attended a Church that dedicated babies and baptized adults as a compromise.  <br>  <br>  I would say this to any brother in Christ who asked me:  be baptized in water (either by immersion or sprinkling--it doesn't matter) if you were not as a child; if you were, it's not necessary to be baptized again.  But be filled with the Holy Ghost, for sure!<br>  <br>  Yours in Christ, Nick|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	It's all three depending on which Bible you choose to believe and how you choose to interpret it, if the Bible had a clear single meaning there wouldn't be so many competing denominations all claiming to be the sole correct one.

There would be books, movies, vigils, crying, pain, (a few parties with some groups of people), some people wouldn't give a hoot either way. So, basically, you would cause more harm then good in that instance.

You might, if not apprehended, face God's wrath psychologically for your deed, possibly even becoming insane or committing suicide.  I think that God would not strike you dead upon the spot, but if you shot the Pope during a thunderstorm, perhaps you would be struck by lightning!

But it got fixed. <br>  <br>  For the record, there are actually HUNDREDS of attempts on the Pope's life every day. Most of them are poisoning and bomb attempts. All of them are caught by the Swiss guard. Also, visitors to Vatican City are checked VERY thoroughly for weapons before you even get in, and if you tried outside of Vatican City, you'd either be checked for weapons before you got into the venue and therefore close enough, or the Pope would be in the Popemobile, which has bulletproof glass, which was installed after the assasination attempt on JPII.<br>  <br>  Also, even countries that AREN'T heavily Catholic help keep the Pope's security up to date.|`|Ayn7TqLRaa	half the world would hate you and the other half would applaud you. <br>  <br>  and God wouldn't do anything.

Jesus.  <br>  Guaranteed it is not a sacrifice, but something that I love to do.  I threw all of my secular music in the garbage along with my booze.<br>  I also don't like to listen to secular TV.   I got saved from those things, adultery, drugs, booze, so why should I listen to music that talks about those things and people that do them.  I have nothing in common with them, they are headed to one place and I am off to another.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	I'm sick of people like you who make these sweeping generalizations that are totally illogical.<br>  You have not met ALL Christians, so you cannot know that they all do this.<br>  <br>  Who are YOU to tell ANYONE what to listen to?

Martin Luther said, the Christian is free from all, obliged to honor no earthly power, yet slave to all, obliged to love all men.  As Jesus said, it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles, but what comes out of the heart.  Music does not sanctify us, and it cannot condemn us.  The beliefs of the heart are what is important to God.  The question is, how does the lyrical content of the music affect what we are believing about God and about ourselves? Popular music is loaded with messages.  This is no accident.  That the Devil seeks to control minds through the onslaught of popular media is hardly something a wise person would deny.<br>  <br>  Contemporary Christian music is artistically vapid, generally, but the messages are certainly different.  Sometimes, even Christian music, is loaded with carnally minded lyrics that are contrary to real faith.  But one has to be up on the Bible to really see this.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I think about the many rockstars who have died young, and when certain songs come on the radio, it's chilling.  A couple of examples:<br>  <br>  "I'm on the highway to hell..."  ---Bonn Scott, dead of alcohol poisoning not long after this song came out<br>  <br>  "married, buried, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..."  --Kurt Cobain, in fact, married, and then shortly thereafter, buried.<br>  <br>  Yours in Christ, Nick|`|xo4iux9gaa	"If any man is in Christ, old things pass away,, behold,All things are made new"|`|CLB32006aa	They are born again and can no longer do normal things that make them happy.

6aIuZZi7aa	You cannot place a photograph next to a black candle and expect it to be effective without your Will. You will need to first decide whether it will be a binding or a curse spell. Then you will need to include an incantation, visualization or other technique into the spell. You should also consider your options, as there are many binding and curse spells which you could do. You could place the photograph in a poppet, mojo bag, bury it, etc. By the way, Pagans are not the only religion which practice magick. Satanists have a hand in it, too. ;-)<br>  <br>  @ Mojo - I find it ironic that your name derives from an ancient folk magic practice.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	I wouldn't do the black candle thing. <br>  <br>  Anything you do to a person by way of magic will come back to you many times more strong. I would suggest a spell to make him leave you, your family, and your friends alone. I would also suggest a healing spell to help his state of mind.<br>  <br>  Don't hurt him. I know you are scared and angry, but it will come back and hurt you if you do anything evil.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Like someone else said, that could be either a curse, banishing, or a binding.<br>  <br>  I think you've endured enough and I see no ethical problems with what you're doing.

AA10761951	Every society needs a particular group to pick on to make themselves feel better. And the Jews won the Whom Do We Pick On? contest. They're the ones that didn't convert to Christianity. Perhaps they thought Christianity was a fad. And people would eventually see the error of their ways and return to the religion Christianity originated from.  <br>  <br>  Judaism tends to be a regimented religion. It's something you have to put effort into.  You have to wear the beanie on your head all the time.  On top of that, Jews aren't out on the streets looking for people to convert. They're just hanging out praising God in their own way.  Think of Judaism as the Other White Meat.  <br>  <br>  Christianity takes little effort to follow.  You go to church on Sunday, sit there for 90 minutes, give them some money.  And you're done until next week. <br>  <br>  Think about it.  <br>  <br>  Would you care if the ants in your ant farm lied to, stole from, and killed one another?  No.<br>  <br>  Would you care if some of your ants hated you?  No.  You'd get a kick out of it.  <br>  <br>  The reason Jews are oppressed is because of religion. If there were no religion, there would be a lot less hatred in the world.|`|C1NgHyu4aa	When people are diferent the regular people get angry and change it.<br>  ex. slaves|`|Fjy3f7czaa	Because in the Christian religion, money is bad.

Hindus, Sikkhs, Buddhists, Pagans, Muslims (they don't worship Jesus).<br>  <br>  So clearly, that is not it!<br>  <br>  2 - to those who say it's because we 'steal' etc - that IN ITSELF IS ANTI SEMITISM.<br>  <br>  3 - to those who reference Israel: anti semitism has existed since way, way, way BEFORE Israel.<br>  <br>  So clearly, nothing to do with that!<br>  <br>  <br>  So to answer:<br>  <br>  There are many theories, but none of them can answer satisfactorily. The best response I have come across can be found here: <a href="http://www.aish.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.com</a><br>  - type in 'anti semitsm'.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jews have been oppressed partly because we are so tiny in number, it makes us vulnerable. Also, we are not typically a violent people - though note, the minute we DO act in self defence, in Israel, the word yells in condemnation....!|`|F32uPjAraa	Because their religion demands that they rip off, steal, cheat, lie to, and even murder, anyone who is not of their faith. They still teach this to their children. Some notable jews in history, Adolph Hitlers mother was a jewess, Roosevelt was jewish, both of Stalin's wives were jewish, and so were Churchill's wives. Dosn't that put a different slant on world war two?|`|TEaFwk1Baa	People didn't like them|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Have you met any?|`|kOoCya9Oaa	I can't think of an ethnic group that hasn't been oppressed.|`|rTplTuEdaa	They hated the Jew,s because they were God,s chosen people<br>     and they were the servant,s of God,,but guess what,,,,now the<br>     Christian,s are hated the same way.|`|uLYlQMs3aa	First it goes back before that. The Jews are for the most part the tribes of Judah, Levi and Benjamin including a few from the other tribes of Israel. They were enslaved by Egypt and then conquered by Babylon as well long before the coming of Christ and the Holocaust later. They have been under constant attack since the foundation of Israel's (Jacob) inclusion in the promise from God to his father Jacob nad his Grandfather Abraham.<br>  They are under attack now do largely impart of people world wide sucking down the lie of the "Palestinians". These people do not have claim to the land they are trying to force the modern nation of Judah (now calling itself Israel) out of. The land they are claiming is theirs (the west bank, gaza and Golan Heights belongs to Judah by right of birthright and the fact that they we're there long before the "Palestinians". These lands were once part of Sumeria which was the land of the nation of Israel. Israel after its split with Judah was taken into captivity by Assyria nd "lost" for all time. 130 years later Judah was taken captive by Babylon. <br>  The new nation of Israel was put together by the dissemination of turkish lands from the Ottoman reign. These lands were given to Britain who gave it to the existing Jewish People. At that time the Arab nations surrounding the new nation of Israel decided to never allow peace with the nascent state.<br>  So there you have it. Hope it helps and yes I will provide more information and even tell you how to locate the lost tribes of Israel!<br>  Good Luck!

lR6Ocjm1aa	An Active Force<br>  <br>  THE Bible’s use of “holy spirit” indicates that it is a controlled force that Jehovah God uses to accomplish a variety of his purposes. To a certain extent, it can be likened to electricity, a force that can be adapted to perform a great variety of operations.<br>  <br>  At Genesis 1:2 the Bible states that “God’s active force [“spirit” (Hebrew, ru′ach)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.” Here, God’s spirit was his active force working to shape the earth.<br>  <br>  God uses his spirit to enlighten those who serve him. David prayed: “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your spirit [ru′ach] is good; may it lead me in the land of uprightness.” (Psalm 143:10) When 70 capable men were appointed to help Moses, God said to him: “I shall have to take away some of the spirit [ru′ach] that is upon you and place it upon them.”—Numbers 11:17.<br>  <br>  Bible prophecy was recorded when men of God were “borne along by holy spirit [Greek, from pneu′ma].” (2?Peter 1:20,?21) In this way the Bible was “inspired of God,” the Greek word for which is The?o′pneu?stos, meaning “God-breathed.” (2?Timothy 3:16) And holy spirit guided certain people to see visions or to have prophetic dreams.—2?Samuel 23:2; Joel 2:28,?29; Luke 1:67; Acts 1:16; 2:32,?33.<br>  <br>  The holy spirit impelled Jesus to go into the wilderness after his baptism. (Mark 1:12) The spirit was like a fire within God’s servants, causing them to be energized by that force. And it enabled them to speak out boldly and courageously.—Micah 3:8; Acts 7:55-60; 18:25; Romans 12:11; 1?Thessalonians 5:19.<br>  <br>  By his spirit, God carries out his judgments on men and nations. (Isaiah 30:27,?28; 59:18,?19) And God’s spirit can reach everywhere, acting for people or against them.—Psalm 139:7-12.<br>  <br>  ‘Power Beyond Normal’<br>  <br>  GOD’S spirit can also supply “power beyond what is normal” to those who serve him. (2?Corinthians 4:7) This enables them to endure trials of faith or to do things they could not otherwise do.<br>  <br>  For example, regarding Samson, Judges 14:6 relates: “The spirit of Yahweh seized on him, and though he had no weapon in his hand he tore the lion in pieces.” (JB) Did a divine person actually enter or seize Samson, manipulating his body to do what he did? No, it was really “the power of the LORD [that] made Samson strong.”—TEV.|`|XN0cYCATaa	The Holy Spirit<br>  The Holy Spirit is the third person in the Trinity. He is fully God. He is eternal, omniscient, omnipresent, has a will, and can speak. He is alive. He is a person. He is not particularly visible in the Bible because His ministry is to bear witness of Jesus (John 15:26).<br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/christianity/christian-doctrine/holy-spirit" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/christianity/christi...</a>|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Nothing hard about it... Holy Spirit is the light of God in you.<br>  <br>  And of course the original gospel was about how to increase that light. Click on my avatar for more context.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	(John 17:26) And I have made your name known to them and will make it known, in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them.”<br>  <br>  Jesus was in union with his Father and in union with all of his disciples that does not mean that they were literally one.But they were in union in thought. <br>  (Genesis 1:2) Now the earth proved to be formless and waste and there was darkness upon the surface of [the] watery deep; and God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.<br>  Just as we plug in the radio to an invisible force that brings it to life.Otherwise it is just a box. This invisible force is used.So God's holy spirit is a force he uses to get the his purpose done.Through the scriptures it has been used in dozens of ways,it fomed the earth,taught the disciples instantly a new language,it probably helped Noah gather the animals in the ark etc.It is not God come down to earth but only his force.For ex. God's finger wrote on the tablets for Moses this was another form of his holy spirit at work.|`|iAXmdQOEaa	The Holy Spirit is part of God,  like the sun's rays or light.

EmOnt7FIaa	Well, slaves weren't taken from that part of Africa, so I doubt your ancestry would be in that region. All of your ancestry would be from West/Central Africa because that is where the slaves were taken from.<br>  <br>  There was no reason to take slaves all the way from Egypt. All of the slaves were taken from the Western Coast of Africa because it was easy and faster just to transport them across the Atlantic Ocean to the American colonies. <br>  <br>  Also if they were to go all the way to Egypt than more slaves would have not survived the journey because it would take twice as long as it would normally take to get the slaves to America because you would have to go all the way around the entire continent of Africa just to get them to the Americas<br>  <br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/africanhistory/1/0/7/M/TriangleTrade001.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/africanhistory/1/0/...</a><br>  <br>  (Scroll down to "Slave Market Regions and Participation".)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_sl...</a>|`|EzrdyxAiaa	not me unless it was in the south!!!|`|oYVxMmbQaa	Are you of Egyptian descent?

KOwzDLPdaa	Its depressing. <br>  After my second child was born I went from a size 12 to a 14 and never really lost it. I was surprised to find out that 14 was considered a plus size nowadays. Especially since most people don't know that Marilyn Monroe, once THE sex icon of her time was also a size 14. <br>  <br>  I am 24 weeks pregnant with a baby girl now and hope I can help her in anyway I can to avoid the social pressures and love herself no matter what, because I feel society is definitely making it harder and harder.<br>  <br>  Plus, Jessica Simpson is likely at the most a size 8 right now. That is healthy! Why do you suppose all of these Hollywood women have fertility problems and have to rely on IVF to have babies! They are so underweight they have fertility issue. <br>  <br>  I am pleased with campaigns like Dove's for girls self-esteem but at the same time its a catch 22 since Dove is owned by the same company that makes the body-spray for men commercials that completely objectify women.|`|5f63dadbbe9931a964419168c9443efdaa	i think its good to be thin and its healthy rather then be fat and lazy. we should all eat right and exercise. we should all stay healthy and look good at the same time. regardless if ur a male or female. most skinny people have less health problem compare to an overweight people. the first thing the doctor will tell you is to shed ur weight, and after that you will feel better as well as look better and have more confident. so stop making excuses and start walking to a healthier you. that is why we should teach our young girls as well as boys in the early part of their lives about the importance proper diet and exercise, and how it will affect our bodies. im sorry to say if your parents fail it is not too late for you and your kids. i allow my children to participate in sports and their diet are monitor, and they get regular medical and dental visit. we go participated in family fun as in walking, hiking, swimming...ect. so there is no reason to let your body go. my daughter is happy and excelling in school she is not fat nor skinny. its called awareness. and dont confused between society from media who are just making story so could sell and get paid. this doesnt seem to appy to men coz men dont care, and most men are not conscientious about their bodies compare to women. that is why women live longer then men.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	well being thin is healthier than being fat.  but not being thin to the point of anorexia.  i think it provides young girls with the sense of staying thin, but parents/guardians should teach young girls that they should stay a moderate weight for their size.  too thin is just as bad as too fat.|`|AA12132958	It isn't right!  I do think it affects all women, it's ok to be thin as long as you are a healthy weight, but Jessica Simpson is only 130 something pounds, that's so ridiculous, that's not FAT!!!!|`|T6V7tGxyaa	it actually makes me mad to think that some people are treated different because of their weight.

lh8Tn02Naa	I once heard a priest lamenting the official teaching of his church on sexuality and the clergy.  Do you know, we're not even supposed to w a n k, he said.  By which I understood him to imply, but of course we do.<br>  <br>  However, your question contains a serious error.  A lot of men experience sexual frustration for a host of reasons, but they would never dream of molesting children.  I'll leave you to imagine what they would dream of.  The one pedophile I have had professional dealings with was a married man.  This is a distinct condition.  It is a form of moral blindness, because typically the pedophile does not think he is doing anything wrong.<br>  <br>  Some pedophiles have been drawn to the priesthood because they were attracted to the idea of being in situations where they could encounter young children in private, and would of course be trusted.  Because of the resulting scandals, and even more because of the Church's quite inexcusable record of trying to protect abusive priests, we now have a situation in which priests are no longer seen as trustworthy although most of them are.<br>  <br>  But I do think priests should be able to marry, not because of child protection, but as a matter of human fulfillment.  In non-Catholic traditions this is not a problem: I believe that in the Orthodox church you cannot be a priest UNLESS you are married.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	The very small percentage of abusers would not have been any less likely to do what they did under those circumstances.<br>  <br>  Protestant priests are allowed to marry, and child abuse arises among them as well.|`|b71b424fc067bf9c2eea3e5af4efb630aa	Masturbation and sexually abusing a child are two COMPLETELY different things.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	I see where your mind is....in the Garbage ....|`|e6t9FPUdaa	You know, if they allowed Ted Bundy to kill cats maybe he wouldn't have killed people.

It's a separate thing altogether.<br>  <br>  "Relieving themselves" and actually having sex actually increases your sexual desire.<br>  <br>  Chemical castration is prohibited, just like other forms of sterilization contraception, by The Church because it is mutilation of the natural body.

Hetero or homo. Its just not professional. For example: A gay guy shouldn't go into his office and be like "I'M GAY EVERYONE!" It is irrelevant to what they hired you for.<br>  I think there needs to be laws set in place for every state that protect the company and the employee. <br>  <br>  No one should get fired for this kind of thing...I'm glad to say that I now work for a great company in MISSOURI!! I put "coming out to my parents" on my interview "test" as one of my biggest accomplishments, and I still got hired!

8G42oyydaa	I have, couldt even motivate myself to bath or wash my hair, went to bed with my clothes on, didnt want to even go to bed because it meant having to wake up the next morning. I wasnt able to motivate myself to eat and went days without eating - got up in the morning and sat at the table and had coffee and cried until I am sick thinking about my kids, or financial problems, or how many things I cant do now because of disabilities.<br>  <br>  I have taken the pain killers, the muscle relaxers, the sleeping pills and lined them all up and thot I should just take them all now. I have played Russian roulette with the pills, taking 4 X as much as I am supposed to, wondering if it will kill me and not caring.. hoping it will but not having the guts to actually take them all.<br>  <br>  I have driven around trying to get up the guts to just drive in front of a semi or a train.<br>  <br>  Living in my car for three days was the lowest I have ever felt. HOW did it come to this? I have children, I have grandchildren and no one cared if I have a place to live or not?  And they know I didnt.  HOW could my children sit down and eat dinner, watch their TV. crawl into their warm comfy beds knowing damn well neither would even have a home if I hadnt helped them with down payments etc? <br>  <br>  My so-called friends dont care either ! Not one has suggested I come and stay with them until I find a place, well actually one couple did, but they live two provinces away so how could I find a place to live from there?<br>  <br>  Going to social services for help in getting a place and being asked if I wanted to go into detox or enter their drug programs when I have NEVER used drugs in my life !  Never drink more than two glasses of wine about every two or three months? <br>  <br>  Being asked if I needed their help to open a bank account and get some "legal" ID when I used to be an accountant and a financial planner and have always owned my own house, and been a contrinuting member in the community?  And worked in the Social Service and Community Service field?<br>  <br>  Being treated as if I was a crack whore because the roof fell on me at work?  Because if you end up with no money and homeless even Social Services assumes you are responsible, you caused it to happen. You are a loser aka crack whore aka alcholic aka low life scum.  <br>  <br>  I didnt think I would EVER adjust to not seeing my kids and my grandchildren and having my daughter living just two blocks from me ! Being told by my son and my daughter they wished I was dead because it depresses them to be around a disabled person who is "no fun" and wont do things with them, like camping, etc and who cancels dates at the last minute because of pain. <br>  <br>  I did get over that, I started HRT for one thing and the difference it has made emotionally and mentally is just amazing !  The depression, the mood swings, the up and down, the weakness, the lack of energy, feeling wrung out and exhausted has all abated ! I am making better decision, people arent able to yank my strings and hurt me. I am calmer, happier...<br>  <br>  Last night out of pure habit, I lay down on the couch and subconsciously, without thinking, said to myself "Ohhh I am so unhappy" and waited for the crying to start !  Then it hit me, I WASNT and didnt feel like crying, in fact I felt very peaceful, and content !  <br>  <br>  My Drs said they couldnt treat the depression, because it was "reactive depression" and not a chemical thing and they were right, it was a reaction to all the sh*t in my life !  <br>  <br>  BUT I believe, 100%, it was also  hormonal - I was so emotionally, mentally and physically "depleted" there were times when I didnt have the energy to stand or walk across the the room.  I felt as if I weighed 400 lbs and was carrying at least that much on my back. In reality I weighed about 100 lbs. <br>  <br>  If you arent on HRT try it.  Menopause can do this to some of us, throw in too much family stress and other problems and you get a complete meltdown !!  Will you look into it if you arent on HRT? Please?<br>  <br>  This too will pass, I wont say because you are a strong woman because I wanted to just KO anyone who said that to me and scream "A strong woman ! WTF are you blind or stupid? LOOK at me! I am dying here !"  <br>  <br>  You carry a heavy load and even God said rest one day a week, do nothing.  Hang out the sign, "closed for the day", walk away, let others do it, if you arent there to do it you know they have to -- one way or another.<br>  <br>  Let go, set it down, walk away from it, let someone else pick it up. <br>  <br>  ((hugs))) Isotope sorry this is to long, I wanted to let you know how LOW I had gotten and have been -- so I DO understand and feel your pain, sending positive thots and a prayer your way,|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	How very fortunate you are to have God reveal himself to you through his children on something as interesting and unique as the internet and YA.

Go quickly.|`|ffbbb387bd63bd0363e7b715ef26680caa	I'm very sorry that you're going through this.  It's miserable, isn't it?  I've gone through a year of this.  2008 was very stressful for me with the death of my mom, my old dog, a young friend, and my only daughter's big move to the big city,  just to name a few things that happened last year.  I've been pulling myself out of it by telling my friends and family how I've been feeling.  They've helped a lot by calling and giving me reasons to get out of bed, even if I don't want to.  I've also started a self-improvement program for myself.  The first thing I did was go in for a medical check-up.  On my doctor's advice, I started weight watchers to get myself healthier, and I'm walking with a friend a few times a week now.  I'm doing things like giving myself manicures, meeting friends for lunch, etc.  I'm starting to feel a little better, but every morning it's a struggle.  This is the first time in my live that I've truly lived alone, and I know I need to adapt to it and make it work.  It also helps to meet up with friends on Yahoo a couple of times a day.  If you continue to feel this way, a doctor's visit is probably a good idea to make sure that there's nothing physical causing you to feel this way.  Take care, and I'll keep you in my thoughts.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	I sure have been there.........prayers help. . you are added to my list right now sweetie !. . .

If I didn't have to go to work I'm sure I would be housebound.  Four day weekends are not a reason to go somewhere but only looked forward to because I don't have to leave the house.  Have you hit the part yet where you actually feel like you don't deserve to get better?  Well, you do deserve to get better.<br>  The hardest part was making the first appointment.  But once I was there I found it was easier to talk about things than I ever thought possible - maybe its because there is no emotional investment between you and the counselor.<br>  Hang on girl, and find some counseling.|`|mp1hh7dMaa	Hello, Spent 2 years  10 to 12 in depression no body understood said i was just plain lazy, tried to beat it out of me not understanding it was an illness. Then they wanted to lock me up in a loony house, but thank god i was adopted by some loving people and the sun has shone ever since 60 odd years later. I often think back and see the funny side to it all.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Yes Nana T, I have been that depressed since my work related injury. I had to work myself out of that feeling each time by praying and by looking at my children and knowing they love me and want me to be strong. It takes love and friendships to keep us going when we feel this way. It usually only lasts a few days tho.<br>          When you feel this way, call a friend and have a good talk and maybe a good cry. It really helps.|`|6ozmjp3xaa	Hi girl I see some of our friends have already answered you,<br>  And I know like Lady Luck said someone is always needing you too, <br>   I do force myself into the shower,and do my personal Hygiene, and if I want, I go back to my room and meditate and let the rest of the world deal   with their own problems,<br>   Sometimes we are the tears of a clown **Edit** Rita rose is a new friend I met here on seniors, she helps me a lot daily|`|kYYHw7xEaa	No, never had the option of not looking after myself.<br>  Depressed, yes.<br>  It would have been easy to "just let go", but someone always needed something. Had to get up, and get there.<br>  I know what you are asking, though.<br>  It's not the person's fault. They can't help it.<br>  <br>  Answer: there isn't one.<br>  Everyone is different.<br>  I don't like meds.

Treat yourself sweetheart,and lets hope that helps. x|`|80lWqRFiaa	Yes, right after moms suicide almost 20 years ago. It was a deep hole I had to crawl out of. You can do it.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Yes, I have, I literally felt shattered.<br>  You're not alone.<br>  There's a bunch of us out here.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	Nana, I have been there often in my life.  I would go for a drive up into the mountains and then get out and walk til I was too tired to think about my problems.  You can have a good cry when you are alone in the mountains and no one knows, also the forest animals seem to want to put on a show for you, like they know you are not dangerous at that point in your life.  I also agree with an earlier poster about getting a pet, my dogs really keep me upbeat.<br>  The Texan's answer is awesome|`|ZW0JHvdraa	NanaT, As someone who has battled depression my entire life, from childhood to adulthood, I am here to tell you that it will subside, and you will feel good again.  It’s hard to see it when you’re “living it,” but just know that it will pass, as surely as it came over you.  I am a survivor in that the people that are closest to me do not know the pain that is with me every day of my life.  Early on I became very adept at putting on a happy face, while all the time crying on the inside. I have learned that it will always be there, but I have also learned how to conquer it.  It has not been an easy road, and it has taken a great deal of self-discovery, but I am here to tell you, that I have always come out on top!<br>  <br>  Whether it’s temporary depression or chronic, depression hurts.  The fact that you are reaching out & talking to people is the absolute best thing that you can do!  Reach inside yourself, and bring it to the surface – talk it through – don’t suppress your feelings.  Talk to someone who you feel that you can confide in, and who has been where you are.<br>  <br>  Just know that you are not alone, and people care – all you have to do is to reach out!  Don’t go it alone!<br>  <br>  HE hears our prayers for you!  God Bless....|`|5d93feba60a6599e3f77941fe4be59d6aa	I was so depressed I wouldn't get out of bed for weeks. I showered and brushed my teeth etc. but I got right back in bed. I didn't do anything else.I lost a lot of weight fast and go very weak. I went to step out on the front porch and my legs gave out.The rest is a long long story. What I had to do is stop taking responsibility for everyone and everything. Everyone had to start taking care of themselves. And I had to let them take part in their own problems and responsibilities. But I only had adults to deal with. I didn't have any small children depending on me. You need to get away for awhile by yourself. Even if it is only for a day. And you need to take care of you right now. You are rundown and exhausted and you need a break.. It will do you a world of good and you will be back to your old self in no time. If you need me you know where I am hon!|`|GIqHMBOpaa	Well, here's a guy that can stand up and say - 'I have been there'.<br>  <br>  All of us encounter depression throughout our lives, however many of us have had it, or do have it, so bad that you can Not successfully deal with by yourself.<br>  <br>  As reflected above, each person is unique, and different approaches work for them.  I believe I tried most all of them mentioned, however, the method that worked for me was - medicine.<br>  <br>  The on set of depression can be caused by many things, some of the most common are deaths in the family, lose of job, relationships - just life in general.<br>  <br>  Mine was caused my lose of job and career at age 57 - age at which it is near impossible to become re-employed in your old type of job, especially if it was high tech, which mine was.<br>  <br>  I had at least 18 months of the depth of depression that you describe - my bed was my best friend.  I was also becoming quite dangerous to myself.  ...I had to do something.  Finally my wife of 33 years FORCED me to go the doctors that I needed to.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you are so deep into it, that you need some outside force/help from others, because you won't/can't do it for yourself.<br>  <br>  ....If nothing else works for you, go to a Good doctor who has a good reputation in treating depression - often times - he/she has to 'test' different medicines before they find the one that works for You.  What works for me, may have have little effect on you.<br>  <br>  And Last - Please, please - get treatment as soon as it starts.  If it continues for more than two weeks - go to a doctor.  It IS a disease, normally a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain.  It is and Will effect not only You in a serious way, but All those around you!!!|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	Yes!  I have tried so many things to get out of a slump...walks outside, music, shopping, exercise, etc...I have found that TRYING too hard just makes it worse. The first time I went through a serious depression was after my father died. There was nothing for it but to go through the grieving process. Time truly does heal...the best that you can do is to get through one day, shower, brush your teeth, make a list that includes even the smallest tasks, and check each item as you go...I do know that taking care of yourself is key, take vitamins, exercise, and smile...It Does Get Better!  HUGS to you!|`|AA11100707	Hate to admit it...but YES! Have gone without washing my hair, taking a shower, cleaning house etc. Have done only the absolute necessary like feeding the cat, washing the dishes and cleaning my bathroom.<br>  <br>  I recognize that those are periods of intermittent depression due to who knows...situational stuff, feeling alone [even when I know I'm not REALLY alone] and fear...fear borne of getting older and what lies beyond.<br>  <br>  ALWAYS BUT ALWAYS...something happens to make me wake up and smell the flowers and count my blessings.<br>  <br>  You are NOT ALONE, my friend. We all go through this and indeed, it does pass...and if doens't - seek help. Help works!<br>  <br>  God bless you!|`|wLSLHJiuaa	I think most people have suffered from severe depression, and it takes a long while to go away.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Found mental and physical things to do to get my mind off my petty little everyday problems.

That needs to be you going into your community and physically participating in a program that enriches your community|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	No, that's a donation, not community service. "Community service" means spending time, not giving money or goods.
pRjTcRnKaa	Mine was when I was out with all my friends and then they made me alugh so hard, that coffe came out of my nose! <br>   Or the time when my crush asked my out then i opened my locker when i was standing right there and all of my tampons fell out!!! He just started laghing and said "Never mind" *LAUGHS*|`|QhnsPDxfaa	I had just left the courthouse, a judgment was pending. We went to a pancake house. I took the ketsup bottle and swirled it to mix it up. The cap was loose and I kept on swirling it. I got ketsup on the waitress, the people next to us, the ceiling, my face, my hair---- everything except the omelet. What do you do? Die of embarrassment or laugh? I chose to laugh at myself.|`|m3iRfxysaa	Being forced to switch to GEICO.|`|tR36oILvaa	i can hardly tell you.

However I was on my bed and I farted on and then I crawled down to the spot and sniffed it. When I got up and turned around all 5 of them were standing there with their mouths dropped open. I was a sophie in high school, so this must've been about a year and half ago.|`|egYNGvidaa	well me and my friends were at a pizzeria and we just got food and put it on the table when i leaned on the table really hard and the table just flipped to the side..everything including the pizza and our drinks were all over the floor. :) we looked at each other and just started to laugh like retards. :p i had fun that night.
JMOLRKRraa	no flying ointment is required. They just get you into a hallucinatory state.<br>  I think just relax and give yourself the suggestion. It is a natural thing. It then becomes a matter of being consciously aware of it.|`|x0giFK1Naa	I've been projecting regularly for a quarter of a century and have never heard of flying ointment before today, despite reading thousands of pages about AP.  So no, it's not exactly essential...<br>  <br>  I rely more on feel than technique nowadays, but there's a good one documented here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/astral-projection/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|Z92LPUqaaa	1. No.<br>  2. Mostly on spirituality sites.  It is a waste of money though.<br>  3. Either just train yourself to have a lucid dream (the same thing as astral projection) or do some deep meditation.  Imagine your body getting lighter.  Eventually after doing meditation you will feel your body vibrate and you will feel like you have lost sense of direction.  Then sometimes, you pop into it.<br>  <br>  Btw, Astral projection is nothing more than a lucid dream.  It is quite an awesome experience but that is all it is.  Don't think that you will be able to go to real places, or alternate dimensions.  It is all your imagination at work.|`|98db9265e124fe3bdd587062c20209e2aa	No you don't need flying ointment, I think you can have as much success without it. I found that brainwave entrainment and binaural beat software works very well. I learned to AP in my teens after reading Journey's Out of the body by Robert Munroe. I had some success with his method,but the most success I've had has been with binaural beat software.<br>  <br>  Moonfish Design have some software called the Astral Inducer and there is a freeware version which will enable you to try the technology to see if it works for you.|`|Tgqji3lLaa	1.

I would be perfectly okay with it. Probably helps that I'm bi lol.|`|F32uPjAraa	I'd be happy that she has the trust to confide in me. How many kids are out there now that believe they can't speak with their parents about anything?|`|WHcBV7rLaa	hypothetically, I would say "Wonderful, we have something in common!"|`|LOSfacl5aa	I would tell her that I loved her and ask her to please practice safe sex|`|rKXf85ipaa	Being bisexual is the new “in thing” for girls right now, if it was a boy I would say he probably telling the truth since being a bi guy kinda sucks with our society the way it is right now.  Since she is a girl she might just be thinking this way because she thinks it cool.  If this is the case you can probably ignore the rest of this.<br>  <br>  She could be a lesbian and saying she is bi makes her still sound semi “normal”.  She could also be in denial of this fact and by thinking she is bi she can still dream of a husband and kids aka a “normal” life.<br>  <br>  She could also just be bi in which case, but it doesn't really matter what she is though, she can't change how she is, it's embedded into her brain since birth.  You pretty much have to accept her for who she is or you'll push her away.  <br>  <br>  Truthfully you should be proud she told you, I have yet to tell my parents I'm bi, I' scared to death what my father will do and I think my mother will try and send me to mental therapy or something to try and make me “normal”.  Though mental therapy might be a good idea for her, not to change her but to have her accept that she is different.  Of course that's only if she is having trouble dealing with it.|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	Society is actually really cool with bisexual women.  They love them.  It's a man's world, and heterosexual men love a Menage a Trois (threesome with two bisexual women).<br>  <br>  Society and Religious Homophobes mostly have a problem with Gay Men. It may be hypocritical, but it's the truth.  All those bible verses aimed at homosexuality, only preach against homosexuality between men.  Although King David had a homosexual affair with Jonathan in the Old Testament, but biblical scholars won't own up to that one and dismiss it as brotherly love.<br>  <br>  So you're daughter should have no problem dealing with our homophobic society and her bisexuality.  You should be supportive of your daughter no matter what her gender is: heterosexual or LGBT.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Tell her you love her and don't understand but will do your best to accept it. <br>  <br>  trust me theres absolutely nothing worse than hearing your mother whom you love, respect, and look up too think that their disappointed in you. Theres nothing you can do about it either, so you may as well accept it.<br>  <br>  Agreeing with Son Of Man. I'm a feminine lesbian and I really don't get much hate. Usually I get "omg how do lesbians .... ?" or "Can I watch? huh huh". Especially for bi girls it's not that bad. Just make sure she uses protection :)|`|UKlO3KI4aa	Id say, "U aw SHO kioot using gwown up wodz!! Aww!"
4wQ277Nkaa	Yeah, I get that with my boyfriend a lot seems like we just dont click sometimes and i think well damn i guess this relationship is going down the drain because he seems to want to hang out with his friends from work more then me and always seems to pick at me about little things. If i were you i would just tell her how you feel and if she dosent care or something or she dosent invite you to go with her on her little lunch date then maybe she is not the one for you. although i said stuff similar to my boyfriend and he pretty much said stop being so sensitive. But things did get better.|`|20y5KZbraa	i would be jealous too! but try to understand that she's worried about her friend... it might hurt her if u get all "catty" (lack of better term.)  give it a little time, and if after the friend has been out a week or so and ur girlfriend is still the same, i would say something.  hope i helped some!

fUnjO18Zaa	Not that I don't BELEIVE it, but I find it somewhat frustrating that priests can't answer simple questions like: why would God allow stuff like cancer. <br>  <br>  From the Bible, the only thing I can really question is that thing about sacrificing one's only son... <br>  <br>  Also, I find it very irritating that people simply say that they beleive everything in it because they are afraid God. It doesn't mean that you are not a devout Catholic if you don't UNDERSTAND something in the Bible, but it just means that you need more help on the subject.|`|fef74a49262aeb6b0c117a7c8734c355aa	We believe the bible to be Gods inspired word - God breathed. Because God is perfect His word is infallible and innerrant. Each of the 66 books of the bible were written by unique human individuals but moved along/supervised by the Holy Spirit. God is true and so is his word. God does not speak with a forked tongue and never contradicts Himself. Also the bible is logical and coherent. In a nutshell man is a sinner and God saves sinners to accept Him.|`|HIdsFdr3aa	The maps are pretty questionable. (For example, there never was a country called "Palestine".) The footnotes are dubious, as can be the "paragraph titles" in some versions.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, I find no difficulty in accepting the actual words of the Scriptures.  <br>  <br>  By the way, there have been modern examples of persons being swallowed by large fish in the Mediterranean, and living even as long as three days.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	The Bible features talking snakes, talking asses, talking dogs, 900-year-old men, worldwide floods that vanish without a trace, magic fire blasting enemies, mass migrations that leave no evidence of their passing, giants, demons, magical signs in the sky, angels, dead coming back to life, and surviving in the belly of a great fish (or whale, whatever) for three days.<br>  <br>  In addition, it gets the order of kinds wrong, has multiple genealogies for one character, gives "credit" for the destruction of cities that were actually destroyed over the span of one thousand years by non-Hebrews to a single man, describes a census that didn't actually happen for decades, and makes all manner of claims about death and an afterlife that are completely unverifiable.<br>  <br>  So exactly what is there believable in it?|`|vciEtUcPaa	Since all scripture is God breathed,to doubt is to doubt God.If there is any doubt to any of the scriptures,then there lies a foundation for doubt in the rest of the scriptures and Jesus said,"If you have faith and doubt not,you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree,but also if you shall say unto this mountain,Be thou removed,and be thou cast into the sea;it shall be done."I'd rather see the miraculous in my life,because my faith was strong in a strong God,then to worry about if one bit of the scriptures were a little bit off.There are many out there who would put down such faith(even a few answering this question),but I've seen miracles in my life and it wasn't because I was believing fairy tales!|`|X5eH20qzaa	As long as it is interpreted in context and not intentionally altered, as it has sometimes been by certain cultish religious sects (such as Catholics, Mormons, and Jehovah's Witnesses), the Bible is the unquestionable, infallible, 100% accurate word of the living God.<br>  <br>  .|`|KhJwOurLaa	Yes they all still believe that the sun revolves around the earth and that insects have four legs.

Now i find that not believable.In Jeremiah there is a verse that asks who are these who fly to the windows as doves. The Bible leaves it up to the readers to decide where the Children of Adam and EVE found there mates if they were the Original parents. There are others but those are the ones of the top of my head for now.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	If I come to something that doesn't make sense, I simply pray about it, research it, do cross referencing on other parts of the scripture that correlate with it, and wait until I have an answer that makes sense.|`|AA10641825	All except for the part where it says God stopped the sun.

So whether or not they believe everything THEY read in the bible, they themselves cannot honestly say that they believe everything that is WRITTEN in the bible.<br>  <br>  PS:  "Bryan is Lyin'" about people being swallowed by, then recovered live from, large fish in the Med.  Please cite your source, Bryan.  Did you make that one up yourself or are you just passing on BS that someone else fed to you?|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Robert: I can give you an answer on why God permits cancer. He permits sickness and other sufferings because we are given trials to be tested to see under what circumstances will we remain faithful to God, and if or not we will use our trials to grow closer to God, turn away from sin we need to turn away from, or for some people, as a means to get their attention so they will listen to God. Also, if things were perfect all the time, then we would not need God for anything, right? But, if we have things wrong with us, we WILL need God and will have a need to cling to Him. Sometime He permits bad things to us so that we will also use these trials to change our perspective on things, or to change in a way we need to change according to His standards. We are being tested to see if we will stay true to Him and trust in Him. This is part of the reason why it is written: Very few will make it through the narrow gates of heaven ( my deepest apologies, I forgot word by word the scripture). Also, God permits things like cancer and other bad incidences or sickness to us because God may also use this as a way to humble those God feels are in need of humbling. There was a couple times God had me in situtations to humble me and to get me to learn how to give Him attention the right way.<br>  <br>  <br>  My answer to the question:<br>  Yes, I believe everything in the Bible, and what has happened in it. However, I can at many times be wary of people's interpretation of the Bible, including on how people use the tern "Church" and how people use the term "Saved". These are my thoughts on The Word Of The Lord ( thanks be to God!)<br>  <br>  Jesus's peace be with you! :)|`|AaVfzRamaa	Yes all of it. There is a few errors but not many. some of the books in the Bible are not as inspired as others. The Book Of Mormon is more perfect because it has gone through less Copyings. the Bible has been through many. But it is still the divine word of God if you live it's teachings you will be Happy. Those who spend their time finding fault and being critical will never know that true happiness. These Books are the word of God. When we pray we ask God questions when we read the scriptures we get our answers. As Ralph Waldon Emerson told the Harvard Divinity School. It is my duty to say to you that the need was never greater for new revelation than now. The Doctrine of Inspiration is lost...Miracles, prophecy....the holy life exist as ancient history only, Men have come to speak of ....revelation as somewhat long ago given and done as if God were dead. And Then the sage of Concord said. It is the office of a true teacher, He warned "to show us that God is, not was; that He speaketh not spake. In essence Mr. Emerson is saying "if you persist in handing out stones when people ask for bread, they will eventually stop coming to the Bakery. God and his son live today the still talk to man is prophets are on the earth. So what might be lost or lacking from the Bible is available to you and me.

BhzCW1rYaa	What we call ghosts reside in the 4th dimension, which is the spirit world and we can't see into that world unless there is a portal or the veil between worlds is thin..<br>  All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...<br>  <br>  I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...<br>  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..<br>  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...<br>  <br>  About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...<br>  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..<br>  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...<br>  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..<br>  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...<br>  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...<br>  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..<br>  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...<br>  <br>  I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..<br>  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...<br>  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...<br>  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..<br>  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....<br>  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|zrEDyQxGaa	1.

Well, I have never been an atheist, though I was not born a Muslim.  I have always believed in God.  To me, creation implies a Creator.  I don't believe that the universe came into being out of nothing.  Islam is not inimical to science, and it is true that some of the verses in the Holy Qur'an are exactly in accordance with modern scientific knowledge, though the Qur'an was revealed over 1400 years ago.  I have given you a link below to a very interesting article on the Islamic view of embryology.  <br>  <br>  Islam IS rational, but of course you have to be able to make that ONE leap of faith, the leap that says "Perhaps I am wrong, let me at least suppose for a moment that there may be a God".  I hope you are able to suspend your disbelief and think with an open mind and heart.  Surely if you are able to do so, Allah will guide you to the Truth.<br>  <br>  Why is not every human Muslim?  Well, if every person reacted rationally, they would be.  But just look around at your fellow humans.  We as a race tend to be short-sighted and irrational.  Any RATIONAL person knows that heroin is bad for you, but millions shoot up.  Any rational person knows that too much sugar is bad for you, yet we continue to buy Super Big Gulps and extra large bags of Snickers bars.  Even when the truth is staring us in the face, we often turn away.  We CHOOSE disbelief and rebellion because we want to chase after whatever it is we are chasing after and we don't want to take responsibility for our lives - and our afterlives.  Allah created us with the freedom to choose.  Not everyone chooses wisely.<br>  <br>  We are born with an innate tendency to believe in God, but our upbringing can change us.  Our parents teach us to believe in many gods, or none at all.  The media teaches us that WE are gods, and in our arrogance we believe.  So it is no surprise, really, that many disbelieve.    We often have to overcome some really strong conditioning to return to that innate knowledge that a loving Creator brought about this universe and sustains it.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of Islam is that, once you've made that leap to accepting there is a God, Islam does not ask you to believe in something that is a logical impossibilty.  We do not try to teach you that one plus one plus one is One, as in the Trinity.  We do not teach that because Adam and Eve made a mistake, all of mankind is doomed.  We teach that you are responsible for your actions and that there will be an accounting on the Day of Judgment.  We teach that science is a good thing, that knowledge is vital, whether it be knowledge of how to recite the Qur'an correctly or how to perform brain surgery.  Science and Islam go hand in hand.  <br>  <br>  I do hope you continue to learn about Islam and I will ask Allah to guide you and help you to understand and believe in Him.  May Allah give you that which is best in this world and the next.  Ameen.<br>  <br>  Fi Aman Allah,<br>  <br>  Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	You are incorrect when you think that Islam has not swept the earth. Constantinople, Indonesia, and many more countries were originally full of christians and other faiths. Today, they are completely Muslim. Additionally out of a population of 6 billion people on earth, at least 2 billion are Muslim. Islam now officially outnumbers the amount of all Christian sects combined, and its growth rate is unprecedented like never before. <br>  <br>  The reason many people do not want to accept Islam is because of Family, they are afraid of being shunned. (My mother converted to Islam from Christianity, and she went through alot of problems with her family.) <br>  They are afraid of what society will think about them, today, the media portrays Muslims as fanatics with a 'backward' religion. They are afraid to accept the truth, and do not want to acknowledge it because it is contradictory to what they have grown up in all their life. Others refuse to consider Islam, despite knowing in their hearts that it is true, and then make up objections, which are then satisfactorily dealt with, and even then, refuse to accept it out of arrogance.|`|AA10624860	Bismilla hir Rahman ir Raheem...<br>  In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the Most Merciful...<br>  <br>  I am glad you are beginning to use your logic, because Islam and logic go hand in hand...<br>  You mentioned the smoke of early Earth's atmosphere...Islam also talks about the Big Bang, and more scientific facts...1400 years ago-<br>  If you want to discover them, go to this wonderful site (All Praise be to Allah)... <a href="http://www.quranmiracles.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.quranmiracles.com</a><br>  <br>  You ask why Islam doesn't sweep across the planet?

But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass, for, verily, Allah will not fail in His promise." 13:31<br>  <br>  "You will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves. And you will surely hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with Allah much abuse. But if you are patient and fear Allah - indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination." 3:186<br>  <br>  "And We have revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good." 5:48<br>  <br>  "Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned." 21:35<br>  <br>  Basically, Allah could have made all Believers, but he didn't and everything here is here for a test... unfortunately these 'Atheists' fail the test... <br>  <br>  May Allah guide you...<br>  <br>  Salam (Peace)|`|FSDjC3Uyaa	Isn't it interesting how no muslim said anything about the big bang until scientists in the 20th century started talking about it?<br>  <br>  M started this religion because he thought that it would be the best way to get an army to fight his supposed enemies.

I had no intention to become muslim, and in fact never saw it happening. I do find islam very rational and thorough.  The point of islam is to study everything with scrutiny . Even our faith and all that comes with it.  The majority of people are ignorant to islamic beliefs. Hatred keeps people from looking at islam without bias. Islam IS sweeping the world no matter how much that scares some people. Free will gives people the option to belief and disbelief. People hold on to the traditions of their fathers , and that keeps them from looking at other options.

Some are made Jew or Hindu and some remain Muslims. <br>  <br>  Islam says there is only one God and Muhammad is the Last Prophet of Allah (Allah is our one and only GOD), We have to believe in the angels, prophets, satan, good and bad comes from Allah (meaning thers no such thing as friday the 13th is unlucky), To believe in Paradise and Hell, and the Revelations (Torah, Bible, Quran etc...).<br>  <br>  About sweeping of atheism of earth. Allah is testing every single human on earth. Therefore everyone can have chance to repent to Allah and accept Islam before death. Allah is Most Merciful. Even if a 100 year old Non muslim accepts Islam Allah will forgive him. That doesnt mean that just because the deeds are forgiven u accept islam. <br>  Imagine that for example, without a ID you are not allowed inside the VIP room. SO will u then say its so stupid that people without ID card cant enter the room? <br>  <br>  See 1400 yrs ago many miracles which wer proven by 'science' by non muslims are comming true. There is a verse in Quran that says Allah will show us people the signs of the true religion that the proof will be crystal clear, And swear to God, the verse is true.<br>  <br>  Islam is at one place (since it was way before science), but Science changes within time. So we cant rely on science all the time since its MAN MADE. BUT RELIGION IS NOT MAN MADE. So religion is always higher than science because God is not like us humans who makes mistakes you know. Allah created us and He will the Most Powerful. <br>  <br>  Muslims do not enter Jannah (Heaven) by the good deeds. We enter by Allah`s mercy. So then one may ask why do good deeds? The answer is obeying Allah. Allah commanded to do good deeds so then we do and Allah will love us and vice versa. With bad deeds is so much hate. bad deeds include masturbation, premarital sex, swearing, stealing, etc...<br>  <br>  The creation of Allah is created by Allah. Allah created us to Worship Him ALone (says in Quran), but unfortunately many have not done that and changed their religion. Till Day of Judgement Shaitan (Satan) will do that to many people. We get evil thoughts and if we obey them then its our own bad. If we ignore then its our own good. <br>  <br>  Also Allah has said that to us addressing as slaves. We are slaves of Allah its common sense. because we obey him. So Allah said that He wouldnt care if we bring our sins as great as the whole earth, He will bring an earthful of Mercy (to forgive the sins). As long as we dont ascribe any partner to Allah, Allah will out of His Mercy forgive us. That doesnt mean muslims wont taste hell.

Guertin, that led Dr. Guertin to accept Islam. <br>  <br>  Dr. Guertin Writes:<br>  <br>   "If you are a Muslim, read this book out of the obligation to acquire knowledge. If you are a Jew or Christian, read it for the same devout motive. Comparative study of religions may be unsettling if your belief in God is based upon non-rational grounds but can only have the ultimately desired result of strengthening your belief. The pervasive belief in God as represented in our motives must be the goal which our religious educators work toward, with gains in sectarian support becoming quite secondary... If you are unable to say that you believe in God, you can still find value in the study of religion. In the following pages of dialogue, you will be pursuing some of the most important concerns of mankind that can be traced back to the beginning of recorded history. The thoughts and historical events are important in their own right, and perhaps you will, as I have, find the way to a belief in God through them."<br>  <br>  Inquiries About Islam<br>  <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/inquiries/" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-islam.org/inquiries/</a>|`|ORbFRn4oaa	You are right and wrong in your theory and ideas about Islam. It needs a lot of study before you finally reach a decision.<br>  <br>  1-  Most Muslims would attract and impress people by the Quran. But as soon as the person decides to be a Muslim, they will direct him/her to the absurd and illogical sources of Hadith and Sunnat, saying that they are compulsory. It is like the hiring process, where you are shown something and put in the other, once you sign the agreement.<br>  <br>  So be careful about that part. And that is why I am saying, you need a LOT of study.<br>  <br>  I too am a devout muslim. The ONLY difference is that I was born and raised in a FIRM SUNNI Muslim family. It was about 7 years ago (when I was 35 years old) that I finally got enlightened with the truth i.e. God Alone, Quran Alone. And the sheer falsehood that is enforced and practiced in the name of religion.<br>  <br>  Since them I am a firm Quranist, Submitter and to be precise a "Reformist".<br>  <br>  2-  It is TRUE that the Quran "DOES" contain Scientific information. This information was far ahead of its time, at the time of its revelation. And I believe that there is information that is far ahead even of the present times. Therefore, a few things may appear as in conflict to the present science. But in the longer run, Science will yield to the facts.<br>  <br>  3-  The Big Bang is CONFIRMED in the Quran.<br>  <br>  4-  The Theory of Evolution is NOT confirmed in the Quran. The Quran does say that evolution WITHIN a given specie is fact. HOWEVER it DOES NOT say that evolution across the specie is possible i.e.<br>  <br>  a-  An ant may evolve to different type of ants etc.<br>  b-  BUT it is NOT possible that an ape would evolve into a human OR a fish will evolve into a bird, a lion would evolve to a goat, an elephant to an ant etc.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  As far as sweeping the world is concerned. I would only say that your knowledge about the Quran is near to a nill at the moment. <br>  <br>  You need to know from the Quran, what is the purpose of life. Did God create all this just for fun, or for a specific purpose.<br>  <br>  And let me tell you that the Quran contains FAR more information than Old Testament. Once you know these things you will know it is NOT for the numbers. The Majority is to be doomed. It is the minority (in fact minority of the minorities) that will be successful.<br>  <br>  As far as sweeping or ruling the world is concerned. I personally think, the numbers are STILL not required for that. The world is ruled by less than 0.5% people of the world. Isn't it ??|`|gndbaRgaaa	Well. Some people naturally just don't want to believe in Islam no matter the proof. The irrationality is these so called facts they think they have. LIke some quote it is violent. Others pay Islam no mind because they just believe it preaches violence and temperance. There areno irrationalities just misunderstandings. There are non-muslims because they refuse to see. They keep there eyes blind. THey ask the computer to show them if Islam is true and trust any anti Islamic site, instead of Askin God. <br>  Those who don't believe choose not too.<br>  <br>  For example if someone wants to believe Islam is false they will purposly go on hate sites about Islam instead of checking for sites that support Islam. WHile others only look for good sites.<br>  <br>  I look through hate sites first and then I look for the answers on Islamic sites. This shows me that no matter what other people say Islam won't and Can't be proven false|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	At their beginning and end, the verses of the Qur’an refer man to his reason, saying: “Use your intelligence! Think! Consult your mind and your heart! Confer with them so that you might know this fact!”<br>  Look at the beginnings and ends of verses such as those; they say: “Why do you not look? Why do you not take warnings? Look so that you may know the truth.” Take note of the way “Know!” is used. Many verses contain sentences that have the meaning of: “Why do men not know, why do they fall into compounded ignorance? Why do they not look? Have they become blind so that they cannot see the Truth? Why do men not call to mind and ponder over their own lives and the events in the world so that they might find the straight path? <br>  We Muslims, who are students of the Qur’an, follow proof; we approach the truths of belief through reason, thought, and our hearts. We do not abandon proof in favour of blind obedience and imitation of the clergy like some adherents of other religions. Therefore, in the future when reason, science and technology prevail, of a certainty that will be the time the Qur’an will gain ascendancy, which relies on rational proofs and invites the reason to confirm its pronounce-ments.|`|oUEzQXDRaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  To be quite honest with you, religion is irrational and only you can believe in God. I can't force it, but I can prove it.<br>  <br>  Before the big bang theory, what was there? Did we come out of no where?<br>  <br>  Imagine, just like there is a garden there must be a gardener!<br>  Just like a watch, there must be a watchmaker!!<br>  <br>  We didn't come from out of nowhere<br>  <br>  As creatures, we are more complex than the human brain, thus there must be a higher being<br>  <br>  Being an athiest, you have no one to forgive you for what you have done, you are all alone and your prayers are meaningless<br>  <br>  We believe in evolution because evolution proves nothing contrary to our beliefs. I believe in the evolution but it doesn't answer what came before it...No one can tell you where we came before the big bang theory, thus you have a Mighty God!!<br>  <br>  Believe in Science..i do!! but i believe science came from God!!<br>  <br>  Salam wa alaikum|`|qbsd9MMGaa	if you believe in science watch '' miracles of Quran '' <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gpff_OwKzk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gpff_OwK...</a>  , watch all of them<br>  <br>  <br>   there are people who will never believe nomatter how much you will preach them. even if obvious.<br>  many people are too weak, they do not want to accept that they make sins, they perhaps don t want to change their life, way of life. they are biased by what media presents about Islam. <br>  there are many, many reverts to Islam, if you research there are also scientists among them.

SD4VtziKaa	I'm pretty sure it was in Greece(maybe. Perseus was born there in a tower). King Acrsius(I think that's how you spell it) had a daughter named Danae who wanted a husband and the king went to the oracle in Delphi and was told that Danae's son would one day kill him so he locked Danae in a tower with nothing in it. He waited for the news of her death but it never came. One night he was looking at the tower it became as bright as the sun and then stopped shining. He found Danae with a son in there named Avengder(Perseus). The king was going to kill him but figured that he was being protected by the gods so to test it, he put the two on a boat in the sea to see if they would die. They were given freshwater and fish by nature and floated to the island of Seriphos. When Perseus was older, he went to the Land Beyond to find Medusa. He also went to a western most island hidden from Zeus where the Nymphs were and their titan father,Atlas, was holding up the sky as his punishment(later in the story he became angry but Perseus turned him into stone with Medusa's head).<br>  <br>  3 antagonists: Medusa, Atlas(i guess), King Polydectes of Seriphos who tried to marry Danae while Perseus was away, 2 Gorgon sisters<br>  <br>  Not sure about the foreshadowing. Hope that helped.
jw72N1moaa	Opposite your drive - do you mean on the other side of the road or over the entrance to your drive? If you have a dropped kerb in front of your house then no-one should park over it and block your entrance.

I had a dear friend who married at the age of eighty and her beau was seventy six.  They were married for fifteen years.  He just recently died.  It was a second marriage for both of them.  They both had lost a spouse the year before and met at church.<br>  <br>  My aunt also married her husband's brother after his spouse also died. They were deliriously happy together with their second marriages.  I don't remember anyone talking about who got what money or possessions. We were all so happy for them.<br>  <br>  I say go for it.  Your money is yours and you don't need to explain to anyone else what you do with it.  Besides your family should want what is best for you. If this fellow makes you happy and it sounds like he does then you should marry him.  You could be married for thirty more years or even longer.  That is more than most people who are married have.  <br>  <br>  BTW ask your daughter if she wants to wait another fifty years to get her trailer cause that is how long you plan on living with your new hubby!

28eea98fddd54ae673d51f8522541419aa	Ridiculous.  Violations of any driving laws should require retesting along with stricter penalties for all ages.  Repeated violations should result in loss of license.  No matter the age.|`|8G42oyydaa	Ok my opinion is that drivers under the age of 20 should be tested twice a year because they have the most accidents.  I live in Canada and 60 is young, someday you and your silly teacher will be there and then you can look back and see how ridiculous your assumptions were.  What will you do or your teacher do if you go in for surgery and the Dr is 60 years old?   Run screaming down the hallway and refuse to have it done?|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	If they ever require people over the age of sixty to take a driving test each year to retain their privilege to operate a motor vehicle then I think that they should provide those people who are prohibited to drive a nice healthy horse and a western styled saddle and a barn with pens to take care of them. If this sounds ridiculous to you it isn't any more ridiculous than to test senior citizens each year as a requirement to operate their vehicles. If you think for one minute that senior citizens are going to relinquish the privilege of operating a motor vehicle you are nutty as a fruit cake. A law even related to that would never be obeyed and the only thing that it would do would be to make senior citizens, outlaws. Who was that masked man ? I don't know. Probably, Paul N , The Texan.|`|GHd84xipaa	yes i am all for that kind of law.i feel the government should make it affordable for the over 60 people so they can afford to take the test every year,because as you get older things in your life change.you can't see or hear as good.your mine sometimes isn't as good as it use to be.your reaction time isn't as good as it use to be either.i feel like having a law like this would make the roads safer.AARP does have driving course for older people,that wouldn't hurt either.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	No it should be based on the number of tickets and or points based on tickets. Why ask a certain part of society to be responsible when others because of age aren't?<br>  A 20 year old or a 70 year old it should be based on the driving record.<br>  I have never had a ticket ever and yet some of the kids have four or more. <br>  No as I said it should be based on a driving record and not on age discrimination.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	Excellent idea.<br>  For everyone over 60 and under 30.<br>  Fines for speeding should be tripled. Also, any other moving violations.<br>  That would cover the cost of the exams.<br>  Everyone should be allowed 2 violations a year. After that -- suspension.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Sounds real good when you just got your license. Wait until you get to 60 and see how it sounds. It's a fact that younger people cause a very large majority of accidents, not the elderly.<br>  <br>  Elderly aren't likely to be driving at night or partying late at the bars. Also not like to be drinking a drink or yakking on the cell phone while driving or even smoking while driving. Yep, they may drive slow but they are not likely to get killed at a lower speed. They usually know where the turn signals are at and use them. That's one thing I rarely see new drivers use. They cant find it or can't get to it while on the Cell phone and driving with their knees.<br>  <br>  There's plenty of laws already made up. Just enforce the ones we have. <br>  <br>  Can't get people to drive with insurance and its a law most everywhere. Now how do you propose testing every year. Not enough drivers license stations or hours in the day for all that testing. Just ain't practical. They usually require a test every so many years anyhow.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	they don't have enough driver examiners as it is in my state, students have to come early and some skip school to take their tests. If the government is forcing the tests, they should have to pay for it. It is doubtful now that most state economies are having financial problems these days.  Seems like it is the younger ones having more accidents, it is in my city any way, too much partying.|`|AA10565336	I answered a question similar to this a while back.

Good luck.|`|AA11017231	I know I'm not answering your questions but I wouldn't do it, not anything over and above what is already required. If our government took that step, I would claim 'Free-Men' status. By right of the constitution, Driving is a right not a privilege, by falling under the jurisdiction of civil law, not criminal or business law. Under the jurisdiction of civil law, there is no age limit to driving, we don't need a driver’s license, nor do we need registration or plates. This is the law and civil law over rides criminal and business law, the brotherhood of 'Free-Men' Drive by these laws. They are taught how to defend their position, how to make a case and how to present it in court. If done correctly, they never lose. I have never taken that stance because I understand the need of those funds to keep our highways in shape. However, with the graft and waste of those funds going on by the guardians of that money, and the constant raising of those fees when it really isn't needed if they would use our money wisely, I have been thinking of joining the 'Free-Men anyway. If the government decided to discriminate against me because of my age, I would join in a heart beat. I will know when I need to quit driving because I am no longer safe on the road. Those who don't know, have other people around them who do. We as a people need to take more responsibility for ourselves, not depend upon the government to be our nanny. It is this allowing our government to make more and more decisions for us that is making our government stronger and stronger and we the people who are supposed to be running our government weaker and weaker. If we don't soon band together and take back control of our government and our rights, we will know longer be a democracy. We will be living in a dictatorship.|`|AA11069376	Don't you think we already have enough laws? Current driving laws prudently enforced should be enough. Most jurisdictions use a combination of traffic fines plus demerit points for common infractions. Habitually poor drivers will accumulate demerit points sufficient to lose their licence and usually require re testing to get it re-instated. For more serious infractions, heavy fines, lengthy suspensions, and even  jail time are options available to get incompetent/dangerous drivers off the roads. In addition Doctors can recommend that licences be suspended from patients of any age they feel are physically/mentally incapable of driving safely.|`|2292675077dae921390116e7862cc989aa	********Seems to me this should be done for all.******<br>  <br>  There are people of every age needing to be monitored.

bda465ikaa	I don't know if a complete list exists. Executions were pretty common in Tudor England. However, Elizabeth was excommunicated from the Catholic church in April of 1570. The intention of the excommunication was to let her Catholic subjects know that it was OK to overthrow her. The religous tolerance Elizabeth showed in the first 11 years of her reign began to change, as more and more Catholics became involved in plots to usurp or murder her. The "rightful" queen according to the Catholics was the imprisoned Mary Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots). At the time of the excommunication Mary was age 27 and shortly to become a widow for the 3rd time.<br>  ---------<br>  Here is a partial list of about 30 people (most of them Catholic). All of them after the excommunication. A contemporary historian said that Henry the 8th said that he ordered 72,000 executions during his reign. It is considered an exagerration, since it is hard to imagine society tolerating that much killing. On the other hand, the holocaust happened.<br>  ---------<br>  Papal documents indicate that some 300 Catholics were martyred from the town Elizabeth was born until the middle of the reign of Charles II. But that is about twice as long as the reign of Elizabeth.<br>  ---------<br>  -John Felton, Aug 1570, Catholic martyr. His crime was posting the papal bull of excommunication in public.<br>  <br>  -Thomas Plumtree , Jan 1571, Catholic martyr.<br>  <br>  -Dr. John Story, June 1571, executed for high treason at Tyburn by being hanged, drawn and quartered . Beatified in 1886 by Catholic church. <br>  <br>  -Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk June 1572, executed for role in attempt (Ridolfi Plot) to overthrow Elizabeth in favor of Mary Queen of Scots.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Thomas Percy, Aug 1572, Earl of Northumberland, beheaded by for treason. He led the rising of the north. Beatified by the Catholic church<br>  <br>  -Cuthbert Mayne, 1577, Roman Catholic priest, "the queen never was nor ever shall be the head of the Church of England" <br>  <br>  -Edmund Campion, 1581, English Jesuit priest who rejected Anglicanism, executed as a traitor as Tyburn<br>  <br>  -Francis Throckmorton, 1584, liaison between Mary Queen of Scots and the Spanish Ambassador, after being tortured confessed a plot to kill Elizabeth and an invasion of England by Henry of Guise, executed for high treason<br>  <br>  - Margaret Clitherow, 1586, Roman Catholic who hid priests and secretly held mass in her home, was pressed to death in York, cannozied in 1970 by Pope Paul IV<br>  <br>  The following were executed for high treason for their role in the Babington Plot, were hanged and disemboweled at St. Giles Field, London:<br>  -Sir Anthony Babington, 1586,<br>  -John Ballard, 1586, English Jesuit priest who was depicted by Daniel Craig in the film "Elizabeth"<br>  -Chidiock Tichborne, 1586 <br>  -Mary, Queen of Scots, 1587, executed for treason, beheaded at Fotheringhay Castle<br>  <br>  The following were executed for helping Father William Watson escape from prison, all were hanged at Tyburn:<br>  -Margaret Ward, 1588, beatified in 1970<br>  -John Roche, 1588<br>  -Edward Shelley, 1588<br>  -Richard Martin, 1588<br>  -Richard Flower, 1588 <br>  <br>  The following were hung for the offense of being Catholic priests, they were canonized in 1970:<br>  -Edmund Gennings, 1591<br>  -Swithun Wells, 1591<br>  -Polydore Plasden, 1591<br>  -John Penry, 1593, Puritan instigator charged with inciting rebellion<br>  <br>  -Henry Abbot, 1597.<br>  <br>  The following were executed for being implicated in a plot to kill the Queen by poison and conspiring against Don Antonio pretender to the Portuguese throne, all were hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn:<br>  -Dr. Roderigo Lopez, 1594, a Portuguese Jew who fled to England to escape the Inquisition, became the Queen's chief physician, under threat of torture from Essex he admitted to planning to poison the Queen<br>  -Estaban Ferreira, 1594<br>  -Senor Tinoco, 1594 <br>  <br>  The following were executed for their part in the Essex Rebellion:<br>  -Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, 1601, executed for treason.

5yFnjp56aa	Every religion is unique. Lily, marigold and rose all are flowers. Is marigold more close to lily or rose, how can you answer? All these flowers grow on land, have roots, leaves, branches, pollens, anthers, petals, sepals, need fertilisers etc. You can read about these religions on wikipedia and check. Various authors did not have time to go through scriptures of these religions. Ladies can not read Vedas and Upnishads anyway and they can not go to mosques either. Maulvies are supreme in Muslims and Brahmans in Hindus. Casteism in Hindus and kaffirism in Islam is another example. Hindus and Muslims both belong to heaven and hell. Both believe that they will get fairies(apsaras) and virgins after death but ladies would not. Both believe in fasting.  Sikhs do not have priests, kaffirs, malecchas, fasting, heaven and hell, ladies can perform any religious duties.In this way Hindus are more close to Islam than sikh religion. Christians believe in idol worship but do not have similar bar on ladies and casteism.|`|Lq2psnTqaa	Buddhism and Hinduism are most alike.<br>  Christianity is most unlike Hinduism.|`|AuCnM6Qoaa	Buddhism and sikhism evolved from  hinduism. Hindi was the first in the area, its not so terribly different than Christians, they have a million gods and we have a million saints that have just as much power as their different gods|`|jard50Yiaa	Hinduism is the predominant religion of the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism is often referred to as Sanātana Dharma, a Sanskrit phrase meaning "the eternal law", by its practitioners. Hindu beliefs vary widely, with concepts of God and/or gods ranging from Panentheism, pantheism, monotheism, polytheism, and atheism with Vishnu and Shiva being the most popular deities. Other notable characteristics include a belief in reincarnation and karma, as well as personal duty, or dharma.<br>  <br>  Among its roots is the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India, and as such Hinduism is often stated to be the "oldest religious tradition" or "oldest living major tradition." It is formed of diverse traditions and types and has no single founder. Hinduism is the world's third largest religion after Christianity and Islam, with approximately a billion adherents, of whom about 905 million live in India. Other countries with large Hindu populations can be found across southern Asia.<br>  <br>  Hinduism's vast body of scriptures are divided into ?ruti ("revealed") and Smriti ("remembered"). These scriptures discuss theology, philosophy and mythology, and provide information on the practice of dharma (religious living). Among these texts, the Vedas and the Upanishads are the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. Other major scriptures include the Tantras, the Agama, the Purā?as and the epics Mahābhārata and Rāmāya?a. The Bhagavad Gītā, a treatise from the Mahābhārata, spoken by Krishna, is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas.|`|nhGIZE71aa	Like:  Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism.  These all evolved from a Hindu philosophical background, and fundamentally do not diverge from Hinduism in an essential way.  Many Hindus throughout history have synthesized teachings from Hinduism and Buddhism, and many see Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu.  You could say that these religions are simply different formulations of the same essential ideas.<br>  <br>  Unlike:  Islam.  It is based on dogma and belief, and in my view was started as a front for the imperialistic ambitions of Muhammad.  Obviously very different from the personal experience-based approach of Hinduism.|`|HIdsFdr3aa	All religions are based on hard work and meeting some ideal in order to be reconciled with God, or return to the center or some similar thing.<br>  <br>  Except Biblical Christianity.  The Bible teaches that no amount of hard work is enough, only the sacrifice of the perfect life lived by Jesus the Christ (or Messiah) is acceptable.|`|CzaVtjndaa	There are a couple of ways to answer your question. First, Hinduism has a plurality of gods and goddesses, which is similar to spiritism, or any other religion with multiple objects of worship.<br>  <br>  The monotheistic faiths--Judaism, Islam, and Christianity--are the most unlike Hinduism because there is only one deity or object of worship.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Both Buddhism and Jainism developed as a form of protest against Hinduism. They offered alternatives to the caste system and raised objections to the movement of the time that had begun to view the Vedas as holy scripture.<br>  <br>  The Hare Krishna Movement, a 20th-century Hindu religious movement is probably most like Hinduism.<br>  <br>  Unlike any of the above would be religions that don't believe in reincarnation:  Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.|`|AA10422553	Quote:-"The monotheistic faiths--Judaism, Islam, and Christianity--are the most unlike Hinduism because there is only one deity or object of worship."(en-quote)<br>  <br>  <br>  >Sanaathana Dharmam(a.k.a.Hinduism) is THE Earliest Religion to talk about ONE and only ONE God.All other world Religions borrowed that idea and adapted in their respective religions<br>  <br>  >The Oldest repository of Religious knowledge namely Rg Veda says:-"Ekam Eva Brahmam Satyam" =One and only One God is Reality----Vipraa Bahutha Vadhanthi"=learned people call Brahmam by many names based on their attributes-----<br>  <br>  >Brahmam(God) is benevolent--so He is "Sivam"<br>  >Brahmam(God) is immanent(Vaasyam)--so He is Vishnu<br>  "Anthar Bahischitha Sarvam Vyaaptha Naraayana Sthithaha"<br>  >For Human beings(Nara) He is the Only path(Ayana) in life for salvation--so He is (Nara+Ayana)=Naaraayanaa<br>  >Brahmam creates and sustains "Life"=--so He is "Virinji"<br>  >Virinji(GOD) is very knowledgeable--so He is Brahma.<br>  GOD is called by different NAMES--and there are NO different GODS.<br>  <br>  These Polytheism,Pantheism ,Heno theism,Monotheism are all empty rhetorics -a FRAUD-deleberately being spread by "Vested Interests"|`|0Mi6AQwxaa	same answer again<br>  <br>  To understand Sikhism you have to understand Hinduism. Hinduism is not Christianity and Islam which are codified religions, and have a book and a prophet. Hinduism has originated from various rituals tribal customs and social life over the centuries. Hinduism has 1000’s of Gods and Goddesses and various diverse thoughts. <br>  <br>  Predominant amongst these thoughts is a way of life called Sanatan Dharma which more than 60% of the Hindus follow, and this is generally mistaken as Hinduism, and the other thoughts are treated as offshoots of Hinduism. The real truth is that Hinduism means Sanatan Dharma AND all the other thoughts. Sikhism is but one of these thoughts. <br>  <br>  Firstly, the British with their policy of divide and rule, and secondly, political turmoil and hatred between Hindus and Sikhs has put the idea of a separate identity in the mind of us Sikhs. Many of my co-religionists will say – but we have different ideas as compared to Hinduism. Sure - I agree that we are different in ways but there are 50 – 100 major different thoughts within Hinduism and we are BUT one of them. <br>  <br>  Do you understand ? Whereas fundamentalist Sikhs we say that we are 1 amongst 7 great world religions the fact is that there are actually 4 great religions. One - Christianity has various branches - Catholic, Protestant, Methodist, Adventist, etc. Second – Islam has various branches - Shia, Sunni, Ahmediya etc. There is Judaism and finally Hinduism ( which is a collection of various beautiful thoughts like Buddhism, Sanatana Dharma, Sikhism, Jainism, Arya Samajists, Vaishnav, Shaivaites Manbhum, Santhal etc ) <br>  <br>  So Sikhism is born out of Hinduism. Guru Nanak was born a Hindu, he was a traveling holy man who followed a custom of Sant Mat ( or Saint Tradition ) quite popular amongst saints those days. It was a thought he inculcated in his believers and told them to learn it. His believers were called Sikhs as Sikh means – ‘to learn’ We had 9 more Gurus. Yes Guru Nanak also took some minor feedback from Islam but that is the nature of Hinduism – to absorb from everyone.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	Actually although Christianity is monotheistic, it has many similarities to Hinduism, far more than Islam. The major similarity is the notion of an incarnate divinity while Islam rejects any such notion. Christians believe that God became incarnated in Christ. Hindus believe that the divinity often takes human form such as Krishna. Islam is absolutely hostile to this notion. This makes Christianity more similar to Hinduism than Islam|`|9q9qFbgyaa	Islam is not like Hinduism obviously,<br>  we don't burn our dead's <br>  and we are not stupid enough to built stone temple and then pray to stone gods that were created by man himself,

I don't consult with and imaginary friend, but instead use reasoning and come to the best conclusion based on the common good.<br>  <br>  I don't think that any religion could possibly be true because i don't think that any god would put his own creations on a planet and make them play a guessing game looking for the right religion, and if they choose the wrong one, condemn them to eternity.<br>  <br>  I also don't understand how "God" could make someone, and their environment, and then condemn them to hell because of what they have done, or failed to do.  It is like making a train track that leads to a brick wall, then training a monkey to drive the train,  and blame the monkey for crashing the train.<br>  <br>  People say, If there is no god, then how did we get here.  It is ridiculous to say that this is proof of a supreme being,  because with this theory, something would have had to have created God.<br>  <br>  Atheism is the one true "religion" because true atheists are open minded and make right decisions because they want to, not just to suck up to an imaginary friend in attempt to avoid "hell."<br>  <br>  The idea of a supreme being has caused and endless amount of pain and suffering (e.g. holocaust, crusades, and terrorism)  and our country being run by presidents with strong faith in god has seem to turn for the worst for our economy and other issues.<br>  <br>  People ask me, what if your wrong, i ask, what if your wrong.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid of upsetting "God" use your common sense.

It is a record of the exact words revealed by God to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. It was then dictated to his Companions who memorized it, and it was written down by scribes. The Qur'an is in every detail the unique and miraculous text which was revealed to Muhammad fourteen centuries ago. Not one word of its 114 chapters has been changed over the centuries.The Qur'an deals with all subjects which concern us as human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, and law, but its basic theme is the relationship between God and His creatures. There are also many verses in the Qur'an concerned with natural phenomena that are astounding. It is impossible to explain their presence in humans terms, given the state of knowledge at the time the Qur'an was revealed. In the West, such statements had never before formed the subject of a scientific communication until recent times.On 9th November 1976, an unusual lecture was given at the French Academy of Medicine. Its title was ‘Physiological and Embryological data in the Qur'an' and was delivered by the famous French physician Dr. Maurice Bucaille. His reason for doing this was that "our knowledge of these disciplines is such, that it is impossible to explain how a text produced at the time of the Qur'an could have contained ideas that have only been discovered in modern times."The citations included in this pamphlet appeared in the Qur'an during the 7th century CE. The Prophet Muhammad was himself illiterate and was living among illiterate people. The Arabs at that time worshipped idols and believed in horoscope and magic and were superstitious. The Arabs very actively opposed the teachings advanced by the Prophet through his revelations.This short article is for you to read and to consider. Because the subject matter is so vast, we have space to mention only a few brief facts from the Amazing Qur'an.<br>  <br>  The Creation of the Universe<br>  <br>  "Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We clove them asunder? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" (21:30) This verse is specifically addressed to non-believers, and touches upon the creation of the universe and the origins of all life. The Qur'an mentions the existence of a gaseous mass (dukhan,41:11) which is unique and whose elements, although at first fused together (ratq) subsequently became separated (fatq). The separation process resulted in the formation of multiple worlds, a notion which crops up dozens of times in the Qur'an (1:1): "Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds." [1,2]<br>  <br>  The Origins of Life<br>  <br>  "And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" (21:30)<br>  <br>  The building blocks of all living things are called cells. They are the basic units of life.<br>  <br>  Protoplasm (cytoplasm + nucleus) is the substance of all living things. Cytoplasm is a jelly-like material consisting of water and dissolved substances. The constitution of protoplasm is about 80-85% water. Without water life is not possible. [2]<br>  <br>  None of the myths on the origins of life that abounded at the time of the Qur'an are present in the text. Furthermore, the fact that all life originated from water would not have been a very easy thing to convince people of 1400 years ago, especially in the desert!<br>  <br>  The Expansion of the Universe<br>  <br>  The expansion of the universe is the most imposing discovery of modern science. Today it is a firmly established concept and the only debate centres around the way this is taking place.<br>  <br>  "The heaven, We have built it with power. Verily, We are expanding it." (51:47)‘We are expanding it' is the translation of the plural present particle musi'una of the verb ausa'a meaning "to make wider, more spacious, to extend, to expand." Some translators were unable to grasp the meaning and provided mistaken translations. Others sense the meaning, but were afraid to commit themselves eg. Hamidullah talks of the widening of the heavens and space, but he includes a question mark. Zidan & Zidan, and The Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs refer to the expansion of the universe in totally unambiguous terms. [1,2]<br>  <br>  The Mountains<br>  <br>  Mountains have always been looked upon as conspicuous landforms, characterized by lofty protrusions above their surroundings, high peaks and steep sides.However, the Qur'an accurately describes mountains as stabilizers for the Earth that hold its outer surface firmly, lest it should shake with us, and as pickets (or pegs) which hold that surface downwardly as a means of fixation."Have we not made the earth an expanse, and the mountains stakes (awtad)?" (78:6-7) and "And God cast into the ground mountains standing so that it does not shake with you." (31:10).

To me I didn't really use to notice. Now that I get complimented all the time I decided to look and compare to see what all the fuss was about and there really is a difference. A lot of girls have thin short eyelashes I suppose that could be frustrating when you see others with nice ones. It's kind of like when you think you have a flaw you notice all other people with a better trait than your flaw but when you have something nice you assume it's just normal and kind of take it for granted. For example I naturally have curly hair and so many people say I wish I had that when I hate it. I want straight hair and it takes me forever to get it that way. I suppose it's just perspective ya know.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Yes, that's a great feature.

And he's always right.  We have his word for it.  But the creationists' "appearance of age" doctrine - God created things which looked as though they had a previous history although they didn't - allows for the possiblity.  After all, if God can create a 200 year old tree when the universe itself is only a few days old, he can easily create a human being who looked as if he had once popped out of his mother's womb, although he never had a mother.  I haven't been to Ken's creationist musuem in Kentucky, but there's a small one in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas, and there Eve is depicted WITH a navel.  Hmmmm indeed.<br>  <br>  There is a clearly a difference of opinion among creationists here.  For the rest of us, it makes no odds since Adam and Eve are legendary characters anyway.

The geographical origins of his cult were unknown to the classical Greeks, but almost all myths depicted him as having "foreign" origins: typical of the god of the epiphany, "the god that comes".<br>  <br>  He was also known as Bacchus[1] and the frenzy he induces, bakkheia. He is the patron deity of agriculture and the theatre. He was also known as the Liberator (Eleutherios), freeing one from one's normal self, by madness, ecstasy, or wine.[2] The divine mission of Dionysus was to mingle the music of the aulos and to bring an end to care and worry.[3] Scholars have discussed Dionysus' relationship to the "cult of the souls" and his ability to preside over communication between the living and the dead.[4]<br>  <br>  In Greek mythology, Dionysus is made to be a son of Zeus and Semele; other versions of the myth contend that he is a son of Zeus and Persephone. He is described as being womanly or "man-womanish".[5]<br>  <br>  The name Dionysos is of uncertain significance; its -nysos element may well be non-Greek in origin, but its dio- element has been associated since antiquity with Zeus (genitive Dios). Nysa, for Greek writers, is either the nymph who nursed him, or the mountain where he was attended by several nymphs (the Nysiads), who fed him and made him immortal as directed by Hermes.[6]<br>  <br>  The retinue of Dionysus was called the Thiasus and comprised chiefly Maenads.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus#External_links" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus#Ex...</a><br>  (Click on link above to get access to these actual links)<br>  Theoi Project, Dionysos myths from original sources, cult, <br>  classical art<br>  <br>  Iconographic Themes in Art: Bacchus | Dionysos <br>  <br>  Temenos of Dionysos, Hellenic polytheist site <br>  <br>  Thiasos Lusios, pagan Dionysian organization <br>  <br>  Dionysos Links and Booklist (A huge list of links.) <br>  <br>  Mosaic of Dionysus at Ephesus Terrace Home-2 <br>  <br>  Bacchus the Musical <br>  <br>  List of archaic and modern Dionysus references. <br>  <br>  The birth of Dionysus from the thigh of Zeus - Volute crater from Apulia, Italy|`|eV6MHADQaa	your doing a study on the god of party and can't find anything?<br>  he is the god of wine and debauchery|`|AXccNMMZaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus</a><br>  <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/bacchus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/bacchus.html</a>

I think it would depend in part on where he is at developmentally.  On the one hand, you might continue taking him, and see if you can make some adaptations to make it a more positive experience for him.  Maybe you could go to a later service?    <br>  <br>  At the same time, if he is on the verge of becoming independent--perhaps going away to college or getting a job--then perhaps you can allow him to make this decision for himself and try hard to BE the church to him.  Show him the difference God has made in your life, by being a good listener, by being patient, kind, etc.  Bring up going to church once in a while, but try not to harass him.  Perhaps you can bring him at special events, like Christmas and Easter, or to fun events, like church potlucks.|`|g8JGLnk6aa	No. You should never make anyone go to church. It should be entirely their own decision, 100%. You had the freedom to make your own decision to go to church, so show the same respect for other people and let them decide for themselves if they want to go. You don't have to agree with their choice but you should definitely respect it.<br>  <br>  Going to church is "right" for you but it may not be "right" for someone else. There is no universal "right" or "wrong" here. The world is not black-and-white, it is a gradient strip with many shades in between the two extremes.|`|aedb18cb864b201ba7d9fcc0a8addbf0aa	You shouldn't force him to do anything. The Bible even says that we shouldn't scare people away from Christianity by trying to force them into it. Just tell him about it occasionally. Tell him about something that you enjoyed in church. Talk to him about what you learned or connect something from church to something he likes. Maybe he'll see how much you like it and he'll ask to go. But really, don't make him go. It should be a thing of choice.|`|JMOLRKRraa	first pray for him. Most likely he needs a different kind of church. Different styles and services, maybe something else would appeal to him more.<br>  It is hard to go to church when your spirit is not being fed. Just because it is a church, doesn't always mean the HolySpirit and presence of the Lord is active there. you have to seek the right place for you.|`|x08oohwpaa	Go by yourself.  It's obviously your thing.  I hated going to church my whole life, the second I moved out of my parents house I stopped going.  Forcing someone to go will only make them avoid it more.

gNy79X6oaa	I guess there is no real way of ever knowing. You just have to trust your gut.<br>  BUT - now this is important - if your friend believes he is bisexual then you have to support him through this.<br>  It's probably a tough and confusing time for him and I'm sure he doesn't need you around saying how he isn't really bi.<br>  Trust him and support him because he needs it.<br>  Also, just because he says he'd never date men or have sexual relations with them doesn't mean he's telling the truth.<br>  He might have just been overwhelmed and didn't want to lay everything on you at once.
1dbcab4a9e9431d3bcdcc1d8cf2e2e24aa	Watch out.  This is a guy who wants you all to himself, and it sounds as if he could become possessive.  You have every right to have both your significant other and your friends, and if he's giving you hard times now he could give you even more trouble down the line.  I would wait until you are both calm, and try to broach the subject gently.  If he cooperates without a problem, he stands a chance of understanding that.  But if he goes off the deep end, I would ask yourself if the relationship is a healthy one.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Dump him, he is a control freak and he has no right to behave badly toward your friends, that is a lack of respect for YOU.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Uh oh!  You're with a control freak.I was with one of those, many years ago..  Ended up that he tried to get rid of all my friends so that he could have me all to himself.  Never wanted me to go anywhere unless he was with me, so he could be sure I wasn't cheating.  Never wanted me to order food from a waiter, but was to tell him what I wanted - and then, IF he thought I should eat that, he would order it.  Tho he was just as likely to order something he thought I'd want better.  His reason?  If I talked to a waiter, I might be signaling the waiter to meet me alone later somewhere.<br>  <br>  Run!  Drop this guy now!  I'm telling you, I know what's ahead for you if you stay with him.  Don't do that to yourself!|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Sit him down and have a talk with him. Tell him that you don't approve of his behavior and that you would like him to be kinder to your friends and at least try to get to know them. Honestly you have been friends longer than he has been your boyfriend most likely, so if he doesn't straighten up threaten him with it. If he doesn't still then kick him to the curb and find someone more respectful to everybody.|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	Ok like when he really starts to be like a real jerk like just tell him to really like knock it off of you know what I mean you do like know when he's being like real nice and really like you know?
xwQ2my6Maa	That would be awesome, but unfortunately we live in a planned and carefully controlled society. We can't go around thinking for ourselves or solving our own problems, otherwise we might start believing we don't need 'them' to solve our problems for us. They would end up losing 'their' power.|`|addec7857a715f2e28715837812ec5fbaa	Gosh, we have one in town: it's called a "Pub"|`|rJJhMQ37aa	No.  Duking it out is never a good idea.  Now, a place to hold a debate might be a better idea.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Honestly if someone is that angry and they want to be the living hell out of each other, they aren't going to take the time to go to the ring and fight.

Their distress and anxiety will reach a point where they can no longer bear it, and they will say, “Who will intercede for us with our Lord so that He will pass judgement amongst His slaves?” and they will wish to leave that place. So the people will come to the Prophets, each of whom will say, “I am not able for it,” until when they come to our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he will say, “I am able for it, I am able for it.” So he will intercede for them, that judgement may be passed. This is the greater intercession, and it is one of the things that belong exclusively to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br>  <br>  and there's also a good hadith:<br>  <br>  It is prescribed for everyone who hears the adhaan and call to prayer to repeat after the muezzin, and when he has finished repeating the entire adhaan, he should send prayers and blessings on the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then recite the words narrated in the saheeh hadeeth from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, who reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer, ‘Allaahummah Rabba haadhihi’l-da’wat il-taammah wa’l-salaat il-qaa’imah, aati Muhammadan al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah, wab’athhu maqaaman mahmoodan alladhi wa’adtahu (O Allaah, Lord of this perfect Call and the Prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege and also the eminence, and resurrect him to the praised position that You have promised), will be granted my intercession on the Day of Resurrection.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 579). There is no phrase in this du’aa’ like “al-darajah al-‘aaliyah al-rafee’ah (the high and elevated status),” so this should not be said. The conjunction “wa” in the phrase “al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah (the privilege and also the eminence) is by way of explanation; waseelah is the status higher than the rest of creation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained it in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, who said that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “When you hear the muezzin and say something like he says, then send blessings on me, whoever sends blessings on me, Allaah will send blessings tenfold on him. Then ask Allaah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a status in Paradise that only one of the slaves of Allaah will reach, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me will be granted intercession.” (Reported by Muslim, 577).<br>  <br>  The “praised position”(maqaam mahmood) is intercession before Allaah so that He will start to judge between His slaves, and no one will be granted this except Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is mentioned in the words of Allaah addressed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “Perform al-salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e., the Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers), and recite the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e., the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’aan in the early dawn is ever witnessed (aatended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night).<br>  <br>  And in some parts of the night (also) offer the salaah (prayer) with it (i.e., recite the Qur’aan in the prayer), as an additional prayer (tahajjud – optional prayer) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to maqaaman mahmoodah (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the highest degree in Paradise).” [al-Isra’ 17:78-79]<br>  <br>  It is called al-maqaam al-mahmood because all of creation will praise Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for that status, because his intercession will ease their distress on that terrible day by setting the process of judgement in motion. And Allaah knows best.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: what durrod? i didnt understand it..<br>  <br>  EDIT: thank u for reading what i said...some ppl dont care to read...thank u for translating durrod...and yes good words in ur text...keep ur good texts about what all muslims can read and i think we all can share true info ...and u never know maybe if a non muslim read ur texts (like those text not those which bash and insult sunni)  and became muslim(ehemm sunni..lol) <br>  but again good work...NICE ...

If you wanted to worry about values, you should have started back in the mid 1980's when people started milking each other for credit.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  "no matter your financial situation you should have enuff values not to steal for doing so you do a domino effect to the American family for the person you rob will be in need for a moment in time"<br>  <br>  I'm glad you're paying attention at least. <br>  <br>  'Should have' is a theoretical statement. People 'should' know stealing is wrong enough that they should know not to rob banks. but they don't.<br>  People 'should' know that firing employees while giving themselves raises causes long term reciprocutions. But they don't.<br>  <br>  There's more to the world then just personal values, and while you and I may be okay, you must also be able to understand that others are not doing as well. They need help, and they aren't getting it from anyone.<br>  <br>  And when people feel that no one cares about them, they have no reason to care about others. This is a much bigger, deeper issue then you think, and a minor theft where no one was injured is just the tip of the iceberg.<br>  <br>  At least no one was hurt. Imagine if it was an armed robbery, or a kidnapping, or even a hostage situation? 250$ isn't the end of the world, and to somebody, the money was worth enough to steal.|`|6KGGAtNtaa	People are going through tough times people need money, Girls Scouts dont really need it opposed to a man who might have a family.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	Compared to hanging girls for believing they are witches, I think girl scout money theft is some improvement.|`|m3iRfxysaa	He probably couldn't afford GEICO's premiums.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Fasten your seat belts!

AA11923447	I've seen people eat human placentas (including one midwife who turned them into placenta milkshakes), but I don't think it's necessarily mentioned in the Bible. Even if it is, I've known both Christians and non-Christians who have ingested the placenta, so I'm not sure that it's a religous rite.|`|89MKzLl3aa	I don't think it does. I could be wrong, though. There were laws of personal hygiene and when women were on their periods in the OT, when the Jews were in the wilderness. I think it's Leviticus.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	The Christian Bible doesn't. Hindus often bury the placenta, and I have several friends who ate their childrens' placentas. But most people just have it thrown out.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	yes, it does here you go:<br>  Although recently an alternative birth phenomenon, delayed umbilical severance has been plentifully recorded in the cultures of the Balinese [5] as well as aboriginal people such as the !Kung. Modern practitioners of Lotus Birth point out that those mammals with whom humans share 99% genetic material, the chimpanzees[6] leave the umbilicus intact, neither chewing nor cutting it, a fact known by primatologists. Therefore, the medical practice of immediate cord clamping and cutting, and its physiological impact is questioned by parents who choose partial or full Nonseverance.<br>  <br>  In Tibetan and Zen Buddhism, the name "Lotus-Birth" was what described spiritual teachers such as Gautama Buddha and Padmasambhava (Lien-hua Sen), emphasizing their entering the world as an intact, holy child. References to Lotus Birth are also found in Hinduism, for example, the story of the birth of Vishnu.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Religious Jews and Christians who choose umbilical nonseverance see it relevant to the strength of Ezekiel who was cast out of his tribe but became a divine visionary, or prophet. Ezekiel 16:4 of the Bible, "As for your birth, the day you were born your navel cord was not cut."

Share it with someone who does.<br>  I can relate to you and really hope that you get the help that you need.
YupMCYHlaa	When you first meet him, look right in his eyes, smile like you're happy to see him, and give him a nice firm handshake.  You want to look eager but not too eager.  Its okay to thank him up front, but if you are thanking him for the interview you should thank him afterwards.  Answer questions without evasion, but carefully, so it looks like you're thinking about what you're saying.  Make eye contact when he talks or when you talk.  Smile a lot and try to relax.<br>  <br>  Yes, you may ask questions too.  People seem to forget that the interview is not just for them to evaluate you but for you to evaluate them as well!  Also it looks good if you take an interest in the company, their product, their history, etc.  In general, though, you let him run the interview.  (In fact, if he's any good, he will ask if you have any questions.)|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	-Extend your hand to shake his<br>  <br>  -Thank him for taking the time to talk to you<br>  <br>  -Remember he is interviewing YOU, you are not interviewing him...but do ask a few questions about the job, to make sure you know it IS what you think it is...|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Shake his hand.  "Hello, it's nice to meet you."<br>  Let him speak and ask you questions.  Answer them as well as you can.  At the end he'll ask you if you have any questions, so have some questions prepared (this is very important -- ask questions!).<br>  <br>  Here are sample questions:<br>  <br>  --What happened to the last person who held this job?<br>  --What are the skills and attributes you value most for someone being hired for this position?<br>  --What major challenges are you currently facing as a manager?<br>  --What is your management style? <br>  --What specific skills from the person you hire would make your life easier? <br>  --How would you describe the experience of working here? <br>  <br>  After the interview is completed, shake his hand.  Ask for a business card.  When you get home write an email to thank him for the interview (it's perfectly fine to send thank-you letters via email these days).  If you need suggestions for thank-you letters, let me know.|`|7DlEN6lXaa	The first person answered you perfectly.

Make dua that Allah gives you Patience.<br>  <br>  If your parents have a go at you just let them because if you answer them back it will only make things worse and by doing so you will be disobeying Allah too.<br>  Then you will have to apologize later and for that you have to swallow your pride even if it wasn't your fault.<br>  <br>  Even if your parents are upon shirk you still have to fulfill their rights.

j2gtKnFdaa	I live in the United States, and I am a Christian.<br>  <br>  Here, if you're 18 you are considered as an adult and a lot of freedom is given to you.

P544Sbmqaa	I have actually had adult stem cell treatment, so of course I support it.  I had a hematopoetic stem cell transplant using cord blood. (thats basically the same thing as a bone marrow transplant, except the cells came from cord blood instead of marrow...   the cells in cord blood are the same type as in the marrow, and the only reason the original bone marrow transplant ever worked in the first place is because marrow are stem cells.<br>  <br>  Hematopoetic stem cell transplants are the treatment in a majority of the diseases that adult stem cells can currently treat.  However, we are currently about 100 years beyond the discovery that bone marrow are stem cells, and people STILL die going through the transplant.  It took them close to 40 years to even get one succesful transplant after the discovery.  I do not think its fair to call embryonic stem cell research over after 10, especially when we have a pile of embryos that are coming from proceedures that the public has no problem with.  I dont understand why its ok to research and experiement with embryos in vain attempts to get preg, in picking and choosing your baby, in many other fields of scientic research such as studying the early development...  But when it comes to something that could save people's lives, its wrong.  I just dont understand the difference.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	It will help a lot of people, although ESC would save more lives.<br>  <br>  The actual whole point of stem cell research is to find a way to deprogram a differentiated cell.

621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	Well, on the surface it appears A may be right and B may be wrong, but it could be more complicated than that...<br>  <br>  First of all, for Person A to be disrespectful of another person's property, and on top of that when in person B's space is totally unacceptable. Therefore Person A cannot go into Person B's space,room, until Person A can learn to have more respect for others and not test other people's boundaries - that's just really bad...  Did person B somehow do the same in person A's space or provoke person A beforehand? That would be equally wrong as well and would explain A's behavior...  If A and / or B really do not like each other, perhaps their time together should be minimized until they learn a way to get along with each other, and that takes a certain amount of effort equally from both sides...<br>  <br>  Now, as for Person B, there really isn't a lot B could have done without also knowing somewhat savvy social skills. If B had made lite of A's behavior or tried to change the subject, then B would also be saying that it's OK for A to throw B's stuff around and that wouldn't be good either. All B was doing was telling A, "NO, stop doing that," and B had every right to do that...|`|AA12317147	Person A erred on two accounts and Person B simply reacted to those accounts.<br>  <br>  Person A had the permission to look at that paper, I presume?

I see A is totally at fault.|`|R1zUIh7taa	I would say they are both wrong.  Person A should have put the sketch back up and not thrown it on the floor.

It is alright for A to compliment B's belongings or character, but it is never alright for A to insult B by tossing about or trashing B's belongings or character.  A must remember that B is the host.  If A is not comfortable, A should politely excuse him/herself from B's room.  B is right and A is wrong.|`|S5LaR6Lfaa	I believe Person A lacks manners by not putting the object back where they found it, though Person B lacked stability and lost his composure.

You have to know how to handle situations like these properly. "What the hell" is not the best expression to use. Therefore, Person A AND Person B are at fault.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Person A was definitely being cruel.  I mean "That's nice Person B" when you really mean "what a piece of crap" is cruel.  I don't know if Person A was being sarcastic or what but there is no excuse for trashing someone's artwork like that.  Especially since Person A just picked it up--wasn't even being shown it.  It's like Person A goes into rooms just to start throwing stuff on the floor.<br>  <br>  Person B would normally confront that type of behavior.  Most of us wouldn't allow someone to just be like Don't mind me in your room throwing anything I touch on the floor.<br>  <br>  Then Person A goes crazy and starts name calling.  Why?  Is that truly the first time Person A has ever been told the world doesn't have maid service and that Person B isn't responsible for cleaning up after you all the time.<br>  <br>  Clear cut Person A is too much a spoiled little princess for you to hang out with anymore.

gGnHOxbTaa	The more you travel the more you can see the good side of people everywhere. But the opposite is true too. The more you travel, the more you can see the bad side of people. Of course, every race has "good" people and "bad" people and good things and bad things about their culture, but racism isn't about hating the awful things that groups of people do or even feeling dislike for certain cultural practices that we don't like or even preferring not to live in certain places. Racism is not seeing past race. It is treating someone badly just because they are a certain race. It is letting those bad things affect how you treat others of that race/locale. The racist person doesn't see a person for who they are, but only sees "what" they are--a person of "that" race. <br>  <br>  Native Americans could hate white people for what they did to their continent (and worse), just as you didn't like what some Hispanics did in parts of south Florida. But those things don't make all white people bad, nor does the situation in south Florida mean all Hispanics bad. It doesn't even mean that every Hispanic person living in those areas is bad--I bet at least some who live there hate it too! <br>  <br>  Prejudice is an attitude, and if you enter an area with a bad attitude, you may leave with a worse attitude, because your attention will be drawn to all the bad things there and may cause you see miss all the good things that culture/race/locale has to offer. But even if you enter with a good attitude, you will notice what is different and thereby may notice the bad faster, and that can start the bad feelings. People who don't travel at all don't have as much opportunity to see the good of other cultures and so are more likely to retain their prejudices because, without exposure, they will not get the chance to see the good things and the good people there--and so people say racists should travel and learn. But, no, travel alone isn't a cure for racism, because it isn't simply a knowledge issue--it is attitude issue. It is a matter of not separating what you feel about "some people" and "some things" from how you treat others. It is a belief that their whole race is inferior to your own.<br>  <br>  Sometimes these feelings can arise from culture shock. When experiencing culture shock, we may start thinking of all the things we miss about our culture and how much we prefer it, and, at those times, all the things we don't like about where we are visiting seem so obvious. Sometimes it takes a while for these feelings to subside. If we don't live there long enough to overcome our culture shock, we may have a hard time overcoming those bad feelings and may miss some wonderful things about the place. <br>  <br>  You have friends who are of other races. So, are you a racist? You can hate what people do, you can hate what a group of people do, but you are only a racist if you assume what a person is like, and hate them for it or think them inferior, based on their race alone. <br>  <br>  IMHO (in my humble opinion), I think you have seen many bad things and have developed very strong dislikes for many things as a result of traveling. I think, perhaps, you are feeling like those bad feelings are coloring how you see people of certain races, and you don't like it. What I have done when feeling these kinds of feelings, is to accept what I don't like about the culture, certain specific people, and the actions of some groups and keep that separate from what I know to be true--that in every race and culture there are good things to enjoy and good people who are shaking their heads with me over the awful things people do.|`|1bcYl6SKaa	Um never leaving your own country's borders is not exactly <br>  "well traveled"<br>  <br>  Visit<br>  Spain<br>  Puerto Rico<br>  Mexico<br>  Japan<br>  China<br>  France<br>  Germany<br>  Jamaica<br>  Portugal<br>  India<br>  <br>  Then you can say you are well travelled and you will beneift by truly learning the culture of other races.|`|81sucrAEaa	seriously dude, how is travelling to a couple of big American cities considered well travelled.

What of the blind women? What of the widow that depended on her husband for income? What of the convert? Will she recieve guidance on her own, or is it better to allow her to marry a man that can guide her in Islam.

I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statues and keep my rules and obey them." ( Ezek 36:27, 11:19-20 ). God's intention was to give His commands and all the ability to do them. That is the new covenant.<br>  <br>  By His shed blood Jesus purchased this new covenant for all who trust Him. Then, on the basis of the forgiveness of sins that he obtained His people ) Matt 26:28 ) , He gave the the promise of the Holy Spirit. Read John 14:16, 15:26, 16:14 for what He said.<br>  <br>  Therefore, by His death and by sending the Holy Spirit, Jesus obtains the new-covenant promises for toe who trust Him. And the heart of that covenant is that our sins are forgiven and the Spirit of God is give to help  us do what Jesus demands, namely, strive to enter by the narrow door. In other words, Jesus' demand that we " strive to enter" does not mean he stands aloof and watches.<br>  <br>  We are not left alone we are not left to ourselves in our striving. The command to strive is the command to experience the powerful striving of God on our behalf in fulfillment of His new covenant promise to causeus to walk in His statues ( Ezek 36:37 ).|`|iNn9mmOtaa	will I is not I will, <br>  <--BC is not AD--><br>  Hebrew is not Greek<br>  and Law is not Grace<br>  as Curse is not Bless<br>  and Death is not Life|`|bfWcfCKXaa	Yes, but if you remember Moses dropped a tablet and it broke. That is how we ended up with just ten commandments instead of 15! I saw it on "History of the World Part I."|`|dDMOJWxwaa	The Lord promised, “A new heart … will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.”24 That spiritual heart surgery, like in the body, may cause you pain and require a change in habits and conduct. But in both cases, recovery brings renewed life and peace of mind.<br>  <br>  Jeremiah's promised covenant was offered to Israel in Jesus' day, but found no enduring acceptance. It has been offered anew in this dispensation and is now beginning to be accepted, with the assurance that in due course, in the millennial era, complete fulfilment shall be brought to pass. <br>  <br>  "This covenant has never been established with the house of Israel, nor with the house of Judah, for it requires two parties to make a covenant, and those two parties must be agreed, or no covenant can be made. Christ, in the days of his flesh, proposed to make a covenant with them, but they rejected him and his proposals, and in consequence thereof, they were broken off, and no covenant was made with them at that time. But their unbelief has not rendered the promise of God of none effect: no, for there was another day limited in David, which was the day of his power; and then his people, Israel, should be a willing people; and he would write his law in their hearts, and print it in their thoughts; their sins and their iniquities he would remember no more. Thus after this chosen family had rejected Christ and his proposals, the heralds of salvation said to them, 'Lo we turn unto the Gentiles;' and the Gentiles received the covenant, and were grafted in from whence the chosen family were broken off: but the Gentiles have not continued in the goodness of God, but have departed from the faith that was once delivered to the Saints, and have broken the covenant in which their fathers were established (see Isaiah 24:5); and have become high-minded, and have not feared; therefore, but few of them will be gathered with the chosen family."

6g97hxCCaa	Camilla only has one son - Tom Parker-Bowles.  She also has a daughter by her first marriage.  Even if either of then turned out to have been fathered by Charles that would make them illegitimate and therefore they would be ruled out of the succession.|`|35d3d80ebc935fe14fabde33ae0e6cedaa	Camilla and her husband Andrew only had one son their other child was a daughter........It would not change the order of succession and Camilla and charles will not have any children of their marriage as she has had a hysterectomy.......|`|zyw4i3kRaa	Prince William AKA the Antichrist :P|`|4IULGFypaa	deff William ...|`|8vKrxSYyaa	Gordon Brown lol.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	No because they would not be "legitimate" ...|`|AA12095483	No, they wouldn't. Camilla was not married to Charles when her boys were born and so they would not be recognized as Charles' sons when it came to inheriting the throne, no matter what their DNA said.|`|bda465ikaa	According to the law, Charles's hypothetical children he has with Camilla would not be eligible for the throne. Subsequent marriage does not change eligibility. <br>  ----<br>  It is different in other countries. In Monaco, Princess Stephanie's children were born out of wedlock. After their birth she married their father, but the marriage last a very short time. However, the children are eligible. Her brother has two illegitimate children. Some people are concerned that he might marry one of their mothers on his deathbed and the child will automatically become next in line for the throne.<br>  ===<br>  By the same token, even if DNA tests were performed on one of the princes, and it turns out that they had a different father, they would not be removed from the line. According to law, a child born to a married woman is presumed to be legitimate. The chief subjects of gossip are Prince Harry (Charles's son) and Prince Andrew (Queen Elizabeth's son).<br>  ===<br>  Advocates of DNA testing feel that Andrew has a good job by virtue of his birth. He has a mansion in Windsor Park which he leases for an excellent rate (formerly his grandmother's mansion). He also has a job that pays over a million pounds per year. Plus executive travel privelages which frequently involve renting helicopters, and private jets. He occassionally travels first class with a small group of aides. They feel that the public is entitled to have DNA evidence of paternity.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	There is no need for an hypothetical question on this one.<br>  <br>  Diana and Charlie are the parents of William and Harry, so after Charles III shuffles off his mortal coil it will be William V who ascends the throne. <br>  <br>  After Charles III to be, the order of succession is: <br>  <br>  <br>  HRH Prince William (Wills) of Wales, <br>  <br>  HRH Prince Henry (Harry) of Wales, then <br>  <br>  HRH The Duke of York Prince Andrew, <br>  <br>  HRH Princess Beatrice of York, HRH Princess <br>  Eugenie of York , then <br>  <br>  HRH The Earl of Wessex Prince Edward, then <br>  <br>  HRH The Princess Royal Princess Anne, son Peter Phillips, daughter Zara Phillips then, <br>  <br>  HRH Princess Margaret The Countess of Snowden, her son Lord Linley, his child, then her daughter Lady Sarah. <br>  <br>  If Prince Edward and his wife Sophie have a child, that child will precede Princess Anne. <br>  <br>  If Prince William marries and has a child, that child, male or female will precede Prince Harry and any offspring he may have. <br>  <br>  There is talk about dropping the old tradition of the first born male being first in succession to the crown, to the first born child. That would mean if Prince William's first born is a girl and has younger brothers, she would become Queen upon Williams death. Making her the first female in history to become monarch before any brothers.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	I believe that legitimate sons have first dibs on the claim to the throne in Britain.

ogLHkR0oaa	No, in my opinion service charge should only be paid for good service, on a recent visit to a restaurant, I asked our waitress if she herself kept the tips or were the put ion a common pot. She replied that they kept their own tips. She got a large tip on top of the bill for excellent service. I would not have tipped as much if they were all put together.|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	NO.But many restaurants charge it,you have two options don't leave a tip or don't go there again.I have been known to do both.Why should I pay for the priviledge of eating there? Why should I tip for bad service?This is bad for business.|`|53748744cddefdf672838d27d8300662aa	Most restaurants automatically add a tip onto the bill(s) for a large group, and I have no problem with that.  For small groups and singles, however, I do not think it is appropriate, and I would not think it wrong to refuse to pay such a service charge.  I would hope that you would leave whatever amount you normally would tip, though.|`|uzIiaT4oaa	No. Its not wrong at all. If you ask for a particular meal at a resturant and the meal doesnt meet your expectations then you are quite within your rights to say to the waiter/owner that you will not pay for said meal but leave your name address so that an amicable result can be acheived. Never, ever,ever feel pressured into paying a service charge. If at the end of the meal you feel that the service charge is unfair then say so. Ask the resturant to justify the serviced charge. If they cant, pay for the meal and walk out.|`|sNNnAZDSaa	no i dont think it is wrong|`|wyAtVqbOaa	I think we should have the right to decide if we wish to pay a service charge or not.  <br>  <br>  I always refuse to leave a tip on the credit card, one being I hate being pushed into leaving one and second I know for a fact that the waitress doesn't actually receive it, it normally goes into a pot which gets shared out between all members of staff and thirdly they end up paying tax on it whereas they don't if you leave cash.  <br>  <br>  If I book a place in a restaurant that states that a 10% service charge is included in the bill of parties more than 8, I make it clear that I will not be paying this unless I am happy with the service.  If they insist that they will charge this service charge anyway, then I leave, taking my custom with me.  <br>  <br>  One restaurant I went to accepted my terms but once the bill came through it had the 10% added to it.  I asked for the bill to be reduced which they refused.  I went and got cash and paid it that way, making sure that we were leaving before I left the cash.  That way, I'm out of the restaurant and they can't catch me before they have counted it up and if they do catch me, I can say that I included it all and somebody must have stolen it from them.|`|6bMBwaosaa	i don't think it's wrong. If restaurants want to charge more and drop the service charge then that would be better. However, if the restaurant has stated it in the small print then you should bring it up at the time of booking and decide where to go from there. <br>  <br>  I agree that waiters and waitresses are usually paid a pittance - as a former waitress myself I appreciated tips greatly however i do feel that it should be a personal choice for receiving particulalry good service - not just for someone doing the job that you are already paying them for!

52fc15f3a628fde8d25145163ff38134aa	Every Christian I know defends their meat eating with the Bible by saying  "God gave us animals to eat" I think it is in genesis, but it says something that claims god geve us dominion over the animals. The bible also supports vegetarianism, but its a pretty hypocritical if you compare every passage. Jesus was also vegetarian, and I think Christians should strive to be a bit more like him, but then after all, they wouldnt be christians anymore<br>  <br>  Freedom: I like that passage. Maybe it explains why nearly all vegetarians I know are atheist, because our faih is weak that a man in the sky told me what I believe is ethical to eat.|`|KsbpC3sMaa	First off the Bible is not God's rule book it's a History book if that. Man turned it into a rule book.<br>  <br>  There is a section in the Bible called the Old Testament. There God gave laws to the Ancient Israelites how to live their lives. <br>  <br>  Some of those laws were based on what meats were safe to eat and what weren't. For instance pork was an unclean meat to eat in the Old Testament, so they should avoid it.<br>  <br>  Some Jews still do to this day.  And that's the fast break down of it all.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	God created animals that they may be a source of food .But the lord says us it wisely meaning do not waste. We are not to eat pig for they are a filthy animal. God cast out of Legion  wicked spirits and cast them into the heard of swine’s .|`|t88527U1aa	No its ok there are no restrictions you want to be veggie person its ok you want to eat meat its ok(in moderation)|`|l3A970zJaa	Anti Christ: I'm pretty sure Jesus ate meat, at several points the Bible talks about Jesus eating fish with his disciples, some of whom were fishermen by trade|`|CBUPymktaa	thankyou Lord .. i'll eat it .. give me a leg ..|`|KWwW7N49aa	Again, those under grace can eat anything that they thanked God for.  I believe man was meant to be vegetarian in the beginning but because of the fall, everything changed.  I believe once in God's kingdom, we will again eat veggies but it won't be necessary for nutrition etc. because we will have incorruptible bodies.  Food will be for pleasure only.  In Romans 14:14, it states "I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat.  But if someone believes it is wrong then for that person it is wrong." etc. This chapter is speaking of those who would distress another believer who wishes to refrain from eating meat.  We are to live in harmony and not be critical if a person wants to do that unto the Lord.|`|AA12194228	For Christians, I don't think there are any restrictions one way or the other.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	There are accounts that God has given his word about the four footed animals that the Jews were allowed to eat with condition that those animals must chew on Cuds like the sheep, the goat, cows etc.<br>  Pigs eat cuds too but since it looks unhealthy as they also chews on carcasses, animal and human wastes including destroying the people's root crops, they were considered not fit to be raised as livestock and eaten. Those Christians claiming what you said must have never read the complete story of the Bible and obviously they only opened the part of the book they were told to look up.|`|uC0xTgkeaa	nope. we christians have no food restrictions- except for maybe people... i'll have to ask my pastor about that one, but i'm assuming that it's wrong.<br>  It says no where in the Bible that not eating meat is a sin.<br>  I personally am fine with vegetarians as long as they don't think they're better than us omnivores, or try to tell us that meat is bad. It should be a personal choice.<br>  <br>  Funny, the vegetarians that I don't like behave like the christians I don't like. I believe that Christianity should also be personal decision, and it bugs me when some people I know think that they are better just because they are christians.|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	I eat very little meat and follow the Old Testament food laws as much as possible. <br>  However, before the flood humans were all vegetarians. After the flood, God told Noah that He was allowed the eating of certain meats. <br>  <br>  When Jesus came as the perfect sacrifice, he did away with the dietary laws. There are many scriptures that tell us this. Therefore, it is not a sin for a Christian to eat meat and it is not a sin if they do not eat meat.<br>  <br>  The only thing in the New Testament is to not do anything that would harm another's faith. If I were with a person who thought it was wrong to eat meat, I would just eat vegetables and if I were with a person who believed it was wrong to not eat meat ( although I have never heard of such a belief) I would eat meat; as long as it was not an unclean meat. It is by choice I do not eat unclean meat, it is not a commandment for we gentiles under the New Convent.<br>  <br>  BTW: <br>  Anti-christ<br>  Jesus was not a vegetarian as we know he ate  the passover lamb and fish as both are mentioned in the Bible<br>  Nick: <br>  The Bible is not a history Book , although it contains a lot of history. It is the True and Living Wordd of God given to us in order to show us the way back to God,.|`|AA11586837	You can eat meat.<br>  What GOD has Cleansed, call not thou "Common".<br>  <br>  See?<br>  <br>  or, Read It For YourSelf!!!<br>  <br>  (hint: New Testament!)  :)|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The Bible does not command us to eat meat. There is nothing wrong with abstaining from eating meat. What the Bible does say is that we should not force our convictions on this issue onto other people or judge them by what they eat or don’t eat. Romans 14:2-3 tells us, "One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him."|`|nzdDdKtyaa	After the global flood, God gave mankind permission to eat meat.  This is not a "command" to eat mean, however.  It is still your choice. Especially today, when they can make certain nutrients artificially, it is not necessary to eat meat.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	YES!! It's says-Kill and eat.End of sentence. It also says that animals were put on the earth for the "use" of animals.God made animal "coats" for Adam/Eve after the fig leaf episode.Do people really think about that story?It says all things are good for man to eat in the New Testament.We are living the NT dispensation.The OT was under the law, we are under grace.If meat makes you sick for some real medical reason,fine.If there is a meat you dislike the taste of, fine.But, to say eating meat is sinful, bad,etc.Give Me A Break! I guess God is a sinner then.It was his original idea.I could offer more examples.But, I feel my point has been made.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	NO. We are free to eat what we want to. In the New Covenant there are no food laws.<br>  <br>  Col 2:16  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: <br>  Col 2:17  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.|`|VKXNWcbGaa	I think it is good for you to eat meat.

mqV9TOv0aa	Mysterious Panda has given you wise advice, but the warning was not strong enough... Study up on Shamanism or the Druid faith, or even some parts of the Wicca following before you make the attempt.

e8f6a3d224ffda0425bec815c48404c5aa	Debemos cuidar el medio y no hara malas formas y guerra por el agua , pues habiendo bastante agua , seguira la vida en la tierra.<br>  Feliz dia,.|`|AMgrRQRLaa	todo esta hecho|`|SDHvDNGJaa	La Guerra por el Agua ya ha comenzado, los conflictos entre Israel y Palestina son debidos a este vital líquido. Las políticas israelíes de colonización de este último territorio han resultado en una situación en la que tierra y agua son canalizadas a las colonias judías. El consumo per cápita de agua para los israelíes es de 320 metros cúbicos, 10 veces más que para los palestinos. Si aunamos a eso el subsidio al agua usada en la agricultura israelí (casi 60 por ciento del consumo total de agua en el país), se puede entender la envergadura del problema, y lo que debería ser su solución. <br>  Medio Oriente depende, en lo que respecta al abastecimiento de agua, de cinco ríos, el sistema hidrológico alrededor de ellos y las lluvias que llenan los acuíferos y lagos. Tal sistema es internacional y de hecho cuatro de esos ríos, Nilo, Tigris, Eufrates y Jordán, cruzan las fronteras entre países. Sólo el peque?o río Litani, en el sur de Líbano, puede darse el lujo de llamarse río enteramente nacional.<br>  <br>  Nada ejemplifica mejor las circunstancias de las crisis y los conflictos que el caso de las aguas del Jordán y su sistema hidrológico. Cuatro países participan de este sistema: Israel, Jordania, Siria y Líbano. A ellos hay que agregar el territorio Palestino en la franja occidental del Jordán, ocupada por Israel desde 1967. El desarrollo económico israelí, el crecimiento de la población en los distintos países y una política de precios subsidiados han creado una situación de perpetua crisis y constantes sequías. El déficit que se prevé en la región en cinco a?os llegará a más de 700 millones de metros cúbicos, y en 15 a?os crecerá la falta de agua en más de mil 200 millones de metros cúbicos.<br>  <br>  En México, la crisis por el agua se ha hecho presente en las últimas décadas, debido a diferentes problemas de sequía que se han dado en el Norte de la República, además por una serie de tratados anacrónicos que nos establecen como deudores de agua del Río Bravo para el país del Norte.|`|0d1f99e8c579a2150b56a3bd0eaf8d92aa	si es cierto|`|41fb80da6fe7d5b31adc30d87bd94d1eaa	la guerra del agua siempre a existido  claro que en una escala menor que a la guerra del petrolio pero en <br>  un futuro cercano se desatara con todas sus fuerzas porque algunos pueblos an podido sobrevir sin petrolio pero nunca sobrevirian sin agua <br>  eso quiere decir que cera una gurra  todos contra todos porque no habran alianzas que sobreviban a la guerra del agua|`|fc2860deeed740878b7de45cf59341e8aa	no sé!

C'est commun à tout les humains, ils souffrent. Que la personne soit fameuse, riche ou puissante ou quelle soit inconnue, pauvre ou faible, ils souffrent tous à certains degrés. Ce qui est bizarre c'est que le petit africain qui n'a rien à mangé peut parfois toléré mieux sa souffrance que le multi-millionaire qui n'a pas son massage quotidien parce que la masseuse est malade. <br>  <br>  Deuxièmement il y à l'origine de la souffrance. L'origine de la souffrance viendrais de 3 sortes de désirs : Le désir des sens (plaisirs sensuelle quelqonque) , Le désir d'être (d'être quelque chose d'autre que ce que l'on est) et Le désir de se débarasser ( Ne plus être quelque chose que l'on est).  Ces 3 désirs amène inévitablement insatisfaction. <br>  <br>  Exemple, Quelqu'un désir ardemment pendant 5 ans de faire l'amour avec cette incroyablement belle femme. Finalement un jour, le moment tant désiré arrive. Il vit le plaisir sexuelle pendant une nuit. Son désir à été assouvi mais il n'a pas atteint le bonheur. Il a été insatifait pendant 5 ans pour redevenir insatifait d'un nouveau désir après. <br>  <br>  Troisièmement et non le moindre, il y a ce qui fait cessez la souffrance. Il s'agit de comprendre que le désir amène la souffrance de l'insatisfaction infini. Pratiquement personne en occident ne comprend cette troisième "vérité noble" du boudhiste. Le constant désir matériel et superficiel empêche les gens de s'ouvrir les yeux sur ce point.<br>  <br>  Quatrièmement et finalement, il y a le moyen pour faire cesser la souffrance. Il s'agit du "Noble sentier octuple"<br>  <br>  1. compréhension juste<br>  2. pensée juste<br>  3. parole juste <br>  4. action juste <br>  5. moyens d'existence justes<br>  6. effort juste <br>  7. attention juste<br>  8. établissement de l'être dans l'éveil <br>  <br>  Atteindre le niveau 8 est littéralement devenir un Bouddha. <br>  <br>  écoute, ce n'est pas simple. ?a semble assez compliqué mais dit toi que ce l'est encore plus. <br>  <br>  Le bonheur c'est l'absence de souffrance. Très compliqué , je te conseil de simplement viser pour le "contentement"|`|267f8624ea930e8145c93860fa2d9ec5aa	non  pas  du  tout,mais  il  faut  juste s'intégrer dans notre  entourage.salut|`|830023fd72b98ba02d7c7cdb06f35b83aa	oui, mais cette idée a été evoquée dans le livre du seul philosophe fran?ais contemporain qui à mon sens est lisible et explicite, André Comte-Sponville, Le Bonheur désespérément...|`|a0af5ae3e685b527b7380645b17bc549aa	désirer fait parti de l'homme, qui ne désir pas ne se conna?t pas.<br>  le bonheur peu être atteint par d'autre moyen que seul toi peut conna?tre, c'est a dire en te connaissant. donc, désirer les choses que je peut obtenir peut me rendre heureux.|`|ecee878ea2c1d2082d37af6132987c21aa	non je ne crois pas, si tu ne désires plus rien tu dois bien t'emmerder

You're right.<br>  <br>  I feel really bad for the guy who wrote this cartoon. I don't think he meant anything racist by it, and they want him and his boss to be fired. Even if they don't get fired, the NAACP is going to boycott them. How can they think that they meant something racist by it? I mean, it was supposed to be just a regular political cartoon. They say it's a call to assassinate Obama, but I think that's a stretch there. I don't think people will listen to them on this one. I don't understand how they can.

dAcNaajsaa	'but I don't know if I want to go into American Law or Shari'ah Law!!'<br>  <br>  Well, shariah law is the law of God and american law is the law of america.<br>  <br>  So i think if you want wehat is best for your true life, and that is the life in the hereafter, which is a lot longer than this present life, and if you want to spread the truth and work for that, then I think the choice is easy. Shouldn't be confusing at all.<br>  <br>  If it is confusing, I suggest you read the Qur'aan again and the answer will be clear insha'allaah.<br>  <br>  'I wish to become an imam/teacher/scholar in Islam and also a lawyer'<br>  <br>  a lawyer following which law ? the law of God or any disbelieving country's law ?<br>  <br>  Because you do realise you will have to justify how you lived your life to God right ? Now i don't know about you but i would not be able to justyify being a lawyer wallahualam.<br>  <br>  I suggest you to instead become a doctor. Allaah has mentioned in Qur'aan that a person who saves one life is as saving the entire humanity.. check this out. If you become a doctor especially one specializing in female problems, or issues, like gynaecology (to all, i questioner is a female) and do so for the pleasure of God, then the benefits are trully much much much much GREATER than being a lawyer, in this world and of course, in the hereafter which is what matters.<br>  <br>  The choice is easy.

If you are going to comment on religion or even Christianity, being an atheist, the least you could do is not write from a perspective of ignorance on the subject.<br>  <br>  God gave Israel the ten commandments through a covenant; a legally binding agreement between the two parties.  No one else, including Christians, were a party to that covenant.<br>  <br>  God did indeed address the issues of the human heart and its desire to indulge the senses of the self.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you and others are confused because you never really bothered to try and see what Scripture says and teaches.<br>  <br>  .|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Because back in the Old Testament days, and through the many centuries of this era up until the 20th century, pregnancy was a GOOD thing and people wanted children.

I asked too many questions that neither the Republicans nor the Pastors could answer.<br>  <br>  And Lillian I have read several ACCURATE translations of the "Ten Commandments" There is NO commandment that says "Thou Shalt Not Kill"  It does say "You will not commit Murder".<br>  <br>  And in the book of Judges it specifies that a fetus is not a person until the third trimester.  And as such you can not "murder" a fetus that is not in at least the last trimester.<br>  <br>  Is it not sad that "Christians" know so little about their own Bible.  If you do not question and research how can you truly know what to believe?|`|JdwogVjAaa	well the bible says that sex is strictly for reproduction and i suppose you could consider abortion as murder|`|LvThe1Hcaa	There weren't such complicated things back then.  Nobody knew what abortions were, birth control rested on a woman's menstrual cycle.  So that's why we have to listen to those who interpret His word, aka the Pope and priests, etc.  Isn't that what we do with our country's law??  We let the judges interpret it.  Frankliin and Washington never knew what ak-47s were, yet they are used in so many murders.|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	Actually, God does clarify the abortion issue for us in the ten commandments.<br>  <br>  Thou shalt not commit adultry.<br>  Thous shalt not murder.<br>  <br>  Pretty clear if you subscribe to the whole ten commandments thing.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Well, it just seems like common sense. I think He kind of expected us to get it. After all, He said He 'knit us together in our mother's womb'. Would you take an old lady's knitting away? No. Then  don't take away God's!<br>  <br>  But He also said we would only be judged on what we knew.|`|qeXlGOm3aa	God does clarify abortion. in an indirect way but He does. He says do not murder. right when a baby is conceived he is a person. so it is murder to abort. and as you know murder is one of the ten commandments. so God says no to abortion|`|XqqLlBe4aa	because he didn't care.<br>  if he believed either way, he would have said something about it.<br>  he obviously doesnt care either way or he would have stated his opinion|`|qpjorXRnaa	Um, He clarified abortion very well, He said that whoever sheds innocent blood will be cursed beyond measure.  <br>  <br>  <br>  GOD IS GOOD!! all the time!|`|5eSJpYbMaa	God was not that technologically advanced back then|`|lqG3SQ40aa	Abortion is murder and murdering is a sin!

The baby in the womb is alive. Abortion is murder. As far as condoms that is perfectly clear also: No sex outside of marriage between a Man and his own Wife. Absolutely no other way.Anyone that takes the life of the innocent is cursed: That means the abortionists and all that support abortion.<br>  God's will is perfectly spelled out in the Bible, When man comes face to face with God they will be without excuse and not be able to even speak one word because God's word shows His will.<br>   Men need to take responsibility and both men and women need to keep sex within marriage.<br>   If there is a woman that has had an abortion contact me and I will give you a link to a place that will help you to handle your pain even though it will never go away.<br>   If there is a woman in Crisis Pregnancy I will help you to locate baby items and other needs and counseling to raise your baby.|`|z7SJaMwuaa	He decided to let us decide about abortion.<br>  You athiest why do you care. Why can't we blame women for abortion they are the ones that give birth to children.<br>  Most women don't even tell there guys when it come to abortion.<br>  They are suppost to choose themselves if they wan't to carry a child be a mom and hold that baby till birth.<br>  I f they don't want to why should any body care.<br>  Now I only stand for abortion only if the girl is rapped, sexually assaulted, has no family.<br>  Why shouldn't any girl or woman have achoice when it comes to giving birth to a child.<br>  They have a choice when it comes to their life and how they want to play and abortion should be withen how they want to live their life.|`|RCdTJ3RHaa	The issue is with killing a person. you mentioned that in your PS.<br>  <br>  If I'm not mistaken 'Do not murder' is one of the 10.|`|eddX99T3aa	i don't think he saw that one coming...|`|yGfmofHUaa	Why does god let rapist and killers go on living?

He tells us in the Bible.  It is not the religions name that would tell us it is true.  It is there teachings.  Religions by law have to have a name.<br>  <br>  Here are some questions to ask yourself about any religion you are interested in. <br>  <br>  (1)?On what are its teachings based? Are they from God, or are they largely from men? (2?Tim. 3:16; Mark 7:7) <br>  <br>  (2)?Consider whether it is making known the name of God. Jesus said in prayer to God: “I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world.” (John 17:6) He declared: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (Matt. 4:10) <br>  <br>  (3)?Is true faith in Jesus Christ being demonstrated? This involves appreciation of the value of the sacrifice of Jesus’ human life and of his position today as heavenly King. (John 3:36; Ps. 2:6-8) <br>  <br>  <br>  (4)?Is it largely ritualistic, a formality, or is it a way of life? God strongly disapproves of religion that is merely a formalism. (Isa. 1:15-17) <br>  <br>  <br>  (5)?Do its members truly love one another? Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) Such love reaches across racial, social, and national boundaries, drawing people together in genuine brotherhood.<br>  <br>  (6)?Is it truly separate from the world? Jesus said that his true followers would be “no part of the world.” (John 15:19) To worship God in a manner that he approves requires that we keep ourselves “without spot from the world.” (Jas. 1:27) Can that be said of those whose clergy and other members are involved in politics, or whose lives are largely built around materialistic and fleshly desires?—1?John 2:15-17.<br>  <br>  <br>  (7)?Are its members active witnesses concerning God’s Kingdom? Jesus foretold: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) What religion is really proclaiming God’s Kingdom as the hope of mankind instead of encouraging people to look to human rulership to solve their problems?|`|fz8PCFRgaa	God does not care about religion, he just wants us to love each other.|`|PhdQR88Paa	he did! he sent his son jesus christ to die for us! and through him and the grace of god we can spend eternity in heaven with him.......... its called christanity|`|PhI5RCKXaa	OMG!!!!<br>  he did Christians<br>  READ

ahS4TuSEaa	In order to enter the kingdom of God, we MUST be spiritually reborn.  It's as true for the high priest as it is for the gay person.<br>  <br>  There are no fags in heaven.  Ted Faggard and his gay prostitute can't get into heaven as is and neither can those child molesting priests.  <br>  <br>  Most of the organized church is filled with wannabees that will bail at the first sign of violent persecution.  They haven't been spiritually reborn and are jackasses trying to gallop like horses.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	The bible was written in an age where tribe size was of the utmost importance. All sexual energy was directed towards filling women with babies as early and as often as possible; all other sexual behavior was criminalized.<br>  <br>  It was a practical matter, and had nothing to do with morality. In fact, quite the contrary; homosexuality isn't immoral - it hurts nobody. Homophobia hurts and sometimes kills - that's what's immoral.<br>  <br>  Christians can't reconcile the idea of a fair god with those barbaric laws, so they have to pretend that homosexuality is an immoral act (it isn't), a choice (it isn't - if you think it is, can you tell me about when you made the choice?), and unnatural (it's not - it's observed in many animal species).<br>  <br>  You could argue that in today's overpopulated world, heterosexuality should be the 'sin'.<br>  <br>  P.S.

Homosexuals don't wake up and go "hey, I think I'm gonna be gay today". So if God is truly responsible for creating homosexuality and then says it's wrong and those who practice it will be punished, he is a sociopath. He puts the "bad thing" there himself, the person has no say in the matter, and then he punishes them if they don't do exactly as he says. It's not a "trial" by any means, it's psychotic control freakery, and it goes back to free will and the Tree of Knowledge. God is humanity's abusive husband.  Besides...God either knows everything ahead of time or he doesn't. If he does, then he knows what every person will do, into eternity. He even knows all hypothetical outcomes and under what precise conditions each would occur (he is God, after all). He would have no need, nor use, of any such trial. Trial nullified.|`|vDr5aROwaa	Being gay is a sin. It is in the bible. As for gay people going straight to hell is incorrect. Gay people only go to hell just like straight people if they reject Jesus Christ as their savior. I know Gay people that I'll guarantee you, I will see in heaven, cause when are people going to get it in their heads not sin is not what sends you to hell, if it does, as I've said before, we are all going to hell, cause we all sin even after we are saved. If a person is gay, but this person believes in Jesus Christ, and continues in this lifestyle, he will still go to heaven when he dies, but he or she is going to lose their rewards and they are going to have to hang their head in shame when they see what they could have had but lost it because they wouldn't repent.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	It is unnatural and not what God purposed for the earth's inhabitants. That is why he created a MAN and a WOMAN to procreate the earth... to fill and multiply the earth. Homosexuality is becoming more and more "the in thing to do" and as time goes on, many make up new excuses to hasten this filthy, debauched lifestyle. Many more humans are becoming more suseptible to this immorality thus many are making up excuses almost daily to justify their filthy, immoral lifestyle.<br>  <br>  But God's word is clear on such matters.<br>  ------------------------<br>  <br>  What God’s Word Says<br>  <br>  In answer, read for yourself what the apostle Paul said at 1?Corinthians 6:9,?10: “What! Do you not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes [“male prostitutes,” New International Version; “effeminate,” King James Version], nor men who lie with men [“sodomites,” Jerusalem Bible; “homosexual perverts,” Today’s English Version], nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom.” <br>  <br>  Note that Paul specifically mentioned those who evidently take on a passive sexual role and those who assume a more active “male” role in their immoral relations. Thus he made it plain that God disapproves of all homosexual acts.<br>  <br>  This is also evident from Paul’s words at Romans 1:18-27: “God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way .?.?. God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them .?.?. That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene.” Here Paul specifically condemned both male and female homosexuality. He condemned homosexual practices as unnatural and “obscene.”<br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled because Jehovah God won't be mocked and many, many, many millions will lose their lives very soon, or if they have already died, they stand no chance at being resurrected because they refused to change their wicked lifestyles.<br>  -------------------<br>  <br>  Also, please stop asking this question as it's been asked and answered so many, many, many times. Just do a search on the forum first before you ask a question; you will find that it's already been asked and answered too MANY times.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Great.. You people who bring race into the equation, stop bringing up BLACK PEOPLE as an excuse "as they cannot help that they are Black and discriminated against", because that crap is so old and played out! Being Black or WHITE -- and as a matter of fact, why don't you use WHITE instead of Black?? -- or better yet, why don't you use Indian, or Asian, or Mexican, etc... instead of constantly using Black people as your excuse to justify or not justify gay and homosexual behavior?? Those of you who continue to use BLACK PEOPLE as some sort of excuse or example surrounding homosexuality are racist pukes and need to adjust your thinking! Stop using Black people for this and that crap! Use your own RACE!|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	Nothing is a sin until you act upon the temptation. Being a homosexual is no more sinful than being a heterosexual. But sodomy is a sin. That is the act and it's an abomination to the LORD.<br>  <br>  Yes, God wants us all to be happy and amazingly, those who trust in Him for their salvation are the happiest folks on the planet. That's because in spite of our sinful nature, when we trust in Jesus, His righteousness is imputed to us. We will still be sinners as we enter the gates of heaven, but we are saved by His grace.<br>  <br>  That same grace can turn a homosexual away from those desires which God finds an abomination. The only thing required is a desire to please God.|`|zupacfZTaa	I also used to think as you...they can't help it. THey were born that way. Growing up and facing a struggle of my own changed my opinion.<br>  <br>  Using your logic:<br>  <br>  Is it a person's fault if they are alcoholics?  What if they can't help being attracted to alcohol?   Well alcoholism does run in some people's families. <br>  <br>  How about if a person is fat or obese? What if they can't help being attracted to food?  I am very serious...this was my issue.  I found I had no power over it.  I was addicted to food as others could be to alcohol cigarettes or porn.   Worse, this is an addiction which is accepted in our society and we don't call it an addiction but it is.  <br>  I was told that everyone in our family is fat and that is the way God made me so I should accept it.  That was a lie.  But I believed it a long time.<br>  I found some serious healing as I followed all the recovery program advice used by the recovering alcoholics, smokers, drug addicts and yes also the sex addicts.  <br>  <br>  Sex and food have a peculiar similarity.  You can't just determine to give either up completely for your life.  God made both for our enjoyment and I am convinced that somewhere in childhood something  can happen  to a child to screw up the healthy relationship he/she was supposed to have with sex and/or food.  For food... it can be the "you get ice cream if you finish everything on your plate whether you are hungry or not."<br>  For sex.. both gay and promiscuous straight sex... it can be a lack of male role model OR a lack of male acceptance of same sex friends on the football team or (or for lesbians...lack of acceptance from mom or friends at girlscouts) or... whatever a complex of many things... I am sure it is different for everyone. AND it is usually HIDDEN so that we can't even remember! So we believe we were born "that way".  But there are hints in our memories, and the more you try to discover and talk to others that have found freedom from an addiction... you'll discover it's true. <br>  <br>  We were designed to enjoy food, within limits.  And we were designed to enjoy sex, within limits.  The limits for sex are called marriage, and just because you marry, you can't deny your wife or husband sex or use the marriage as a coverup so no one will think you are struggling with this.  Not fair to the other person.<br>   <br>  What's wrong with being gay? Well... no one can answer that except those who have broken free of it.  And they will tell you.  If you are convinced you were made that way... then they may offend you because you are not ready to hear it. But I don't think you were made that way, and I dare you to consider that what if my opinion is true? <br>  <br>  That said... no one has any  business "Converting"gays who believe they were born that way.   We have no business bashing them or preaching at them if they are not open to it (any more than telling a fat person that they are too fat. It's rude and won't bring a change in anyone only more pain.).  Treat people with respect and before you go out trying to save someone else... take a look at your own sin and bring that before God first.  <br>  <br>  Here's a website to check out that could be helpful to you.<br>  <a href="http://exodus.to/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/" rel="nofollow">http://exodus.to/component/option,com_fr...</a>|`|QKs0PFVpaa	You will only get "cos God says so"<br>  <br>  Those people cant explain it cos they're robots.

Marriage has always been about inheritance and property rights. Read Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe by John Boswell for a very in-depth examination of the sacred text from which the Bible was derived.<br>  <br>  Early Christian Gnostics had no problem with same-sex unions I believe it was the Catholic Church in the 13th Century that broke away from the Gnostics and added all these rules. Keep in mind that movable type wasn't invented until the 16th Century so Bibles were not accessible to the masses until many many many years after Christ's death. Even the Gospels were not written until many years after the death of the disciples.<br>  <br>  God hates shrimp!<br>  <br>  EDIT: As to the sodomy explanation, heterosexuals engage in far more sodomy than homosexuals.

However, as one Christian expert has said …<br>  <br>      “Gender, race and impairment all relate to what a person is, whereas homosexuality relates to what a person does.”1<br>  <br>  In contrast, homosexuals claim that scientific studies have shown that there is a biological basis for homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Three main studies are cited by “gay rights” activists in support of their argument2Hamer's X-chromosome research,3 LeVay's study of the hypothalamus,4 and Bailey and Pillard's study of identical twins who were homosexuals.5<br>  <br>  In all three cases, the researchers had a vested interest in obtaining a certain outcome because they were homosexuals themselves. More importantly, their studies did not stand up to scientific scrutiny by other researchers. Also, “the media typically do not explain the methodological flaws in these studies, and they typically oversimplify the results”.6 There is no reliable evidence to date that homosexual behavior is determined by a person's genes.<br>  <br>  To the extent that biological or social factors may contribute to a person's bent toward homosexual behavior, this does not excuse it. Some people have a strong bent towards stealing or abuse of alcohol, but they still choose to engage or not engage in this behavior the law rightly holds them accountable.<br>  <br>  The final report of the Baptist Union of Western Australia (BUWA) Task Force on Human Sexuality states “that a person becomes a homosexual ultimately by choosing to be involved in same-sex activity… This is in contrast to innate characteristics such as gender and ethnicity.”7 The report affirms that “the Bible is clear that sin involves choice, and it unequivocally condemns homosexual behavior as sin.”7<br>  <br>  The foundational teaching on marriage and sexual issues is found in Genesis chapters 1 and 2. When Jesus was questioned about marriage, He referred to these 2 chapters (Matthew 19:1-12; Mark 10:1-12). Genesis teaches us that “male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:27). We were created to a plan, male and female complementing each other. That is, God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, nor Madam and Eve.<br>  <br>  Genesis also teaches that God instituted and designed marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:18-25). There are a number of reasons why He did so.<br>  <br>     1.<br>  <br>        The complementary structure of the male and female anatomy is obviously designed for the normal husband-wife relationships. Clearly, design in human biology supports heterosexuality and contradicts homosexuality.<br>     2.<br>  <br>        The combination of male and female enables man (and the animals) to produce and nurture offspring as commanded in Genesis 1:28 “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth.” This command is repeated to Noah after the Flood (Genesis 8:15-17). But procreation is not the only reason God made humans as sexual beings. The BUWA report affirms “that sexual intimacy between husband and wife is good, and is intended by God for bonding, pleasure and procreation.”7<br>     3.<br>  <br>        Thirdly, God gave man and woman complementary roles in order to strengthen the family unit. Woman was to be the helper that man needed (Genesis 2:18). However, the woman's role as the helpmate is certainly not an inferior one. The enterprising God-fearing woman in Proverbs 31:10-31 is an inspiring role model.|`|uc9M9QFVaa	god said so.|`|kNWevwzUaa	mouths licking the private parts, are defile...<br>  <br>  pen** enter the an** is disgusting.

Something disappeared in my apartment (that i know i had) and then reappeared few months later. I thought i was losing my mind at first but then i realized someone had to come into my apartment.  I immediately changed all my locks the next day.  I have a very high suspicion who was in my place but i cant proove it.   It was someone who ive knows for a long time and who actually lives in the same building.<br>  <br>  If you cant change the locks, i would probably freak out!  I would do something about it like get a hidden camera or move out.|`|4z1gryIGaa	If you had asked this a few years ago I would have said you were imagining things, but I will tell you what happened to me. I was renting a few years ago and noticed that things were disappearing from my fridge, a sandwich here, a soda there..just different things. One day I set a trap I bought a sandwich and left it in the fridge when I got home I checked and it was gone. It freaked me out so bad I left my apt scared to come back. Later I found out that my downstairs neighbor's kid would sneak into my apt when I went to work. He would climb in through my partially open kitchen window(mind you I lived on the third floor he actually had to climb a ledge to get in, very dangerous to say the least). The owner eventually put them out, because he did this to others as well.|`|Ixae0HsAaa	maybe someone you invited was chewing gum|`|vwtVRW11aa	It could be a maid or like room service...|`|N7CiDYmUaa	mayb if u have guests ovr smtimes u 4got to clean out ur trash can|`|AA11627889	Ask the owner.

He is my rock & a grounding force for me. We are total opposites on how we meet the world & handle just about everything. It seems what I am not that is his strength & what he is not is mine. We compliment each other in so many ways. There have been clashes thru the years, but they have only added to us rather than taken anything from us. This is a second marriage for both us, & I had actually given up on dating & was a single parent for 13 years when he walked into my life. So many people have added to me & helped to shape who I am today & sometimes I wonder if he knows just how much he has helped me find my wings! I am the luckiest woman in the world! Thru all those lonely years all I wanted was someone who would love me, seems I got my prayer answered!<br>  Thank You for this question, I think I am going to go give him a big hug right now.

fZkm2Jbeaa	i believe i can explain this, as the law of energy conservation states energy is never created nor destroyed just redirected, thus the human brain(and consciousness) is run on electrical charges and all memories are carried by electrical signals through out the neurons, any-who when a person dies their energy doesn't go with there physical manifestation, rather the electrical signals (i.e. memories) are perhaps transmitted and go searching for a "blank slate" to re-manifest themselves but they are never successful only allowing fragments of memories to appear in the subconscious . then as the child or "blank slate" has its own life the memories of the past slowly seep away into oblivion or just blocked out completely. and the cycle continues.  that's my theorem anyway|`|jkW2b55Qaa	Reincarnation isn't true.   If you can explain it, do it.<br>  <br>  If you say you 'won't bother but know it is true', why should I believe you?

Genetic memory (like in that assassin's creed game anyway) doesn't exist. The only thing stored in DNA is a code to produce certain chemicals and cells. Memory is stored in your brain which stops and rots when you die.|`|e7TmWT4Uaa	idk if it exsists but, maybe humans can be forced as animals by god as punishment on earth after they die.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	There is no such thing as 'reincarnation' in the first place.|`|3d97cedda0f936e37048a4e1d413a7f8aa	well, maybe. who knows.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	Not unless my families genetic memory goes back 3000 years. And if i can remember my past lives why can't the rest of my family?<br>  I don't think science will be able to explain or accept reincarnation, not even with thousands (if not millions) of people that have past life memories, and even psychology is accepting of it, some psychologists are now being trained in past life regression therapy because certain behaviour and emotional disorders have been found to be caused by events from past lives. It seems science can accept theories about things, but certain things like the afterlife and so called "supernatural" things are still taboo for the scientific mind because it can't be explained, it's answer to the question "Why?" is "Why not?."|`|A01w1dHqaa	Mind makes the body so any genetic material comes from Spirit first.<br>  <br>  I'm not interested in proving it.

Chaos is only patterns you haven't yet seen.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	One of the remarkable things to emerge from the science of chaos is that under certain conditions, ordered, regular patterns can be seen to arise out of seemingly random, erratic and turbulent processes. Computer graphics makes it possible to study how these patterns appear and disappear with changes in the system parameters. Many natural phenomena, such as the vortex of a tornado, can now be subjected to computer modeling.<br>  <br>  Another very interesting finding of chaos theory is that there are higher levels of order that unify many of the diverse and complex patterns observed in different types of systems. That is, even though the systems themselves and their associated patterns may be quite different, there is a commonality in the rules which seem to govern the transition from chaotic to ordered motion. A simple analogy will illustrate this point: every house can be described by a unique set of blueprints, but each set of blueprints must conform to the Uniform Building Code. In other words, even the rules have rules.<br>  <br>  Chaos theory is only one of the many areas where the appearance of patterns acts as a powerful engine driving scientists in an unending study of nature and the human condition. The following question seems appropriate: What is it about patterns that is so attractive that some of us spend an entire lifetime digging away in a dimly lit corner of human knowledge searching for something as intangible and as abstract as "structure" or "order"?<br>  <br>  In attempting to answer this question it is important to realize the extent to which patterns affect our lives from birth onward. We enter this world with an exquisite pattern recognition system which immediately goes to work processing megabytes of input data every second. Shapes, cycles, sounds, tastes, smells, feelings--all going into the creation of higher order structures which are vital to our growth and adaptation to the environment. The program which does all this data processing could be called MEANING, and one of its jobs is to let the organism know when the pattern recognition process has come up with a "match". Now I don't know how it does this, and I don't think anybody else does either. But if I had to speculate I would say it's probably by means of a wonderful little molecule called an endorphin. Whatever it is, it results in a feeling that we later learn to associate with "understanding" or "got it!" or "aha!" Or maybe just "meaning."|`|hXQnR2Scaa	No.<br>  Because 100% chaotic systems do not display predictable patterns.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  Gravity ALWAYS works on the macro scale, for instance.<br>  That is not a pattern in a chaotic set of results, it is a predictable. calculable law.<br>  <br>  Interesting thought, though.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	The laws of physics and the laws of mathematics are different.|`|UtND0R2Baa	It seems like the nature in general leans towards some sort of order. We could be wrong with the particular laws we have identified but I don't think we're wrong in finding a pattern.|`|bOiAHI8paa	yes,we see patterns of chaos.

Although the idea of a personal god as described in the bible or other holy texts seems highly unlikely based on the fact that there simply isn't any evidence that one exists. Nor is there any evidence based on what we understand about how the universe operates, that one is needed. Now what kind of deity would create a universe that looked as though it wasn't created by an intelligent force at all?|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	There is a chance of anything.  I could be god, statistically speaking.  But it ain't likely.  And neither is it likely that there is a god.

0V8vOMczaa	you can do a sleepover spa night things where everyone gets manis and pedis, paraffins, massages and stuff like that. Be creative and see what your freinds like to do. You could make smores with a roaster, and play games and stuff on your computer, wii, whatever you have. If your with your girlfreinds then you should have fun no matter what.

9CCtt077aa	Not at all. Many straight guys love club/dance music, and many gay guys love rock. lol Music has nothing to do with sexual orientation .|`|RXS9K18Faa	i'm glad you asked this question. A lot of people think that just because guys like britney spears, beyonce, kelly clarkson and singers like that it automatically makes them gay. but its not true. Music cannot define a person because its just what music you like. it doesn't tell whether you like guys or girls it just tells you what music you like to listen to.<br>  <br>  its another stereotype that ignorant people have come up with.|`|WHcBV7rLaa	I wouldn't say it defines it but sometimes it can hint.<br>  For example, a man who listens to Pansy Division (a ******* awesome queercore band) is more likely to be gay, but I know a straight guy who listens to them so it's obviously not a general rule or anything.|`|DIqqgNaVaa	no but im not one to talk cause im obsessed with the most homosexual of music broadway and im gay|`|uky2nsh8aa	no<br>  that's just stupid.|`|8OXVSoe0aa	No. I hate madonna, britney spears, and all of those people.

Ayn7TqLRaa	Mermaids pool in Derbyshire. Legend is that if you visit this pool/pond at midnight and stare into its waters you will see a mermaid who will grant you untold wealth and riches. However you will never find true love in you life.<br>  The pool itself also sits at the highest point around and no one can explain where the water comes from and why it never runs dry.<br>  <br>  Me and my friend spent the summer of 1995 trying to find this pool (we actually went at midnight for 5 weeks with torches into the bleaker parts of Derbyshire, and we actually found it by accident (we were to stupid to actually read the ordnance survey maps!) one summer afternoon (the summer of 95 was a gloriously hot one, with little rain) and it did (sort of) live up to it's expectations in so much it was on the highest peak around and it was full of water but it did smell pretty bad and no mermaid appeared but about 1,000 frogs did!!!<br>  <br>  But it was interesting as it hadn't rained for weeks and the ground was parched but the pond was still full of water!!<br>  <br>  You'd think most mermaid stories would come from coastal areas but Derbyshire must be England's most land locked county!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your search!|`|15VxE4vdaa	mermaids came to a village on the shore of plymouth rock. they slaughtered everyone- men women and children. then just when you thought it was safe the largest  and most undesirable of their kind would strip of their scales and parade the beaches nude. what a very low point in the history of  the manatee.

c86c730c04e882f7b55f2de802af73e2aa	Non à priori. Une religion est un ensemble de rites codifiés à la suite de l'intervention d'un prophète pour permettre à des croyant de se RELIER à Dieu. Les prophètes n'ont pas eu en principe d'ambition de pouvoir, chose que l'on observe chez ceux justement qui ont institutionnalisé les rites de chaque religion. Par contre, si on analyse l'Histoire, on se rend compte que certains prophètes on dévié justement de leur mission et ont profité de leur influence pour s'emparer d'un pouvoir temporel.|`|afbd1632fe7bdba327266dc27aa6c1ceaa	j'en doute fortement, je pense qu'il y a une grande différence entre ce qu'ils souhaitaient et ce qui a aboutti|`|d41cd7ce8d24e00fa0e937f4ae890668aa	au début je ne crois pas, ils voulaient juste que les hommes croient en dieu, qu'ils aient fois en lui.

Donc par définition, les prophètes sont le fondement de la religion. <br>  <br>  Dans le cas de Moise, les dix commandements sont définitivement une tentative pour créer un culte (religieux)<br>  <br>  Dans le cas de Jésus, en tant que tel il n'a pas créé de religion mais est utilisé comme icone pour la religion catholique. <br>  <br>  Dans le cas de Mahomet, il est celui qui à écrit le Coran et donc est l'investigateur du culte islamique. <br>  <br>  Des prophètes sont plut?t des philosophes utilisant le "divin" et le culte pour répendre leurs philosophies. Dans ce sens ils souhaitent créer des religions pour favoriser l'expension de leurs idées.<br>  <br>  Edit : pour devianunja, selon moi les prophètes comme Mahomet et Moise avaient non seulement des ambitions de pouvoir, mais aussi on utilisé cette ambition pour répandre leurs idées.

Si me comenta que está enamorado de esa persona de su mismo sexo, lo dejaría de mutuo acuerdo. Si es porque es bisexual, le diría que elija a quién prefiere y que no juegue con dos personas, aunque desde ese momento seguramente se acabaría la relación al tiempo porque no olvidaría que se fija también en personas de su mismo sexo. Se sea de la condición que se sea, no podemos obsesionarnos con otra persona si tenemos ya pareja. No está bien eso. Deberá elegir sea el caso que sea.

pCu69Jzvaa	Argumentarle o ponerle pretextos no cre que sirva de mucho, como le ganas una discusión a Dios, si sabe todo lo que hicimos, las situaciones que vivimos y la intención de nuestro corazón en cada momento, en función de esto la pregunta clave a responder desde ya es ?Cuánto Amé?, cuanto dí de mí a los demás, cuanto ayude al prójimo, a mi familia, a mis amigos, a los deconocidos, junto a esto se me mostrará todo lo que pude haber hecho y no lo hice, decirte si me salvará o no, no me corresponde a Mí sino solo a mi padre que esta en los cielos.<br>  <br>  Ante esto lo mejor que puedo hacer es dar mas de mí para el engrandecimiento del Reino del Amor de Dios en la tierra.<br>  <br>  Copio algo sobre este tema<br>  Todos hemos deseado en algunos momentos de nuestra vida, ser jueces de los demás. Opinamos con facilidad acerca de su vida juzgando si hicieron bien o mal. Sin embargo, nos cuesta trabajo pensar que nosotros también vamos a ser juzgados al final de nuestra vida y que nuestros actos, por más secretos que hayan sido, van a trascender más allá del momento en el que los hicimos.<br>  <br>  ?Qué sucede con el alma después de la muerte?<br>  <br>  Los cristianos encontramos en el Evangelio algunos pasajes que nos hablan acerca del destino del alma. Específicamente, en la parábola del pobre Lázaro (Lucas 16, 22) y en las palabras que Cristo dirige al buen ladrón, crucificado junto a él (Lucas 23, 43). <br>  <br>  Al morir, nuestra alma se separará de nuestro cuerpo. Se presentará ante Dios para recibir, de acuerdo con lo que nosotros mismos hayamos elegido en la vida terrena, la recompensa o el castigo eterno. <br>  <br>  El Juicio Particular<br>  <br>  Al morir, tendremos un Juicio Particular. En este juicio nos encontraremos ante Jesucristo y ante nuestra vida: todos nuestros actos, palabras, pensamientos y omisiones quedarán al descubierto. <br>  <br>  Suena dramático, pero es real. Si nos encontramos en gracia de Dios, nuestra eternidad feliz empezará en ese momento. Si morimos en una actitud de rechazo total y voluntario a Dios, en pecado mortal, entonces empezará para nosotros el castigo eterno, el infierno.<br>  <br>  El Catecismo de la Iglesia Católica nos habla de la “retribución inmediata después de la muerte de cada uno como consecuencia de sus obras y de su fe” (n. 1021). El destino del alma será diferente para cada uno de nosotros, de acuerdo a cómo hayamos utilizado nuestro tiempo de vida en la Tierra.<br>  <br>  Hay muchas personas que dicen: “Yo me voy a salvar, pues nunca he hecho el mal a nadie”. Hay que tener cuidado, pues ese día no se nos juzgará sólo por el mal que no hayamos hecho, sino también por el bien que hayamos dejado de hacer. Debemos preocuparnos no sólo por evitar hacer el mal, sino por hacer el bien a todo el que nos rodea. Si no hacemos el bien a los demás, llegaremos al juicio con las manos vacías y “no aprobaremos el examen”.<br>  <br>  El Juicio Particular, como su nombre lo dice, será para cada uno de nosotros en lo personal. En éste, Dios nos preguntará: “?Cuánto amaste?” Y cada uno de nosotros tendrá que responder a esta pregunta. Dios espera que cada uno de nuestros actos sea hecho por amor .<br>  <br>  San Juan de la Cruz tiene una frase que dice: “Al atardecer de la vida, seremos examinados en el amor”.<br>  <br>  <br>  El Juicio Final<br>  <br>  El Juicio Final lo tendremos al final de los tiempos, cuando Jesús vuelva a venir glorioso a la Tierra. En él, todos los hombres seremos juzgados de acuerdo a nuestra fe y a nuestras obras. <br>  <br>  La resurrección de todos los muertos, “de los justos y de los pecadores”, precederá al Juicio Final. Los que hayan hecho el bien resucitarán para la vida, y los que hayan hecho el mal, para la condenación (Juan 5, 28-29). <br>  <br>  En la Biblia podemos leer cómo será este juicio en Mateo 25, 31.32.46: Lo que sucederá ese día, de acuerdo con la narración de Jesucristo, será como un examen de aquello que nos caracteriza como personas humanas: nuestra capacidad de amar.<br>  <br>  En ese día saldrán a la luz todas nuestras acciones y se verá el amor hacia los demás que pusimos en cada una de ellas.<br>  <br>  Este amor será el que nos juzgará:<br>  <br>  "Venid benditos de mi Padre… porque tuve hambre y me disteis de comer, tuve sed y me disteis de beber…"<br>  <br>  "Id malditos al fuego eterno… porque tuve hambre y no me disteis de comer, tuve sed y no me disteis de beber…" <br>  <br>  El Catecismo de la Iglesia Católica nos dice: “El Juicio Final revelará hasta sus últimas consecuencias lo que cada uno haya hecho de bien o haya dejado de hacer durante su vida terrena” (n. 1039).<br>  <br>  El juicio final es la prueba de que Dios es infinitamente justo y ha dispuesto todo con sabiduría para que la verdad se conozca y se aplique la justicia en cada hombre con el destino eterno que él mismo se haya merecido. <br>  <br>  Algunas personas piensan que no hay que preocuparse por eso de los juicios, pues creen que Dios va a salvar a todos los hombres al final de los tiempos porque es infinitamente bueno y nos ama. <br>  <br>  Es verdad que Dios es muy bueno, pero también es muy justo y respeta nuestra libertad. Cuando nosotros estamos en pecado mortal, libremente le hemos dicho a Dios que “no nos interesa salvarnos”. Si morimos en este estado, Dios respetará nuestra decisión. El hombre, con su libertad, alcanza la recompensa o el castigo eterno.<br>  <br>  Frente a Cristo se conocerá la verdad de la relación de cada hombre con Dios. <br>  El Juicio Final revelará que la justicia de Dios triunfa sobre todas las injusticias cometidas por sus criaturas y que su amor es más fuerte que la muerte. <br>  <br>  Reflexionar tanto en el Juicio Particular como en el Juicio Final nos recuerda que mientras tengamos vida, tenemos oportunidad de alcanzar nuestra salvación. Cada día nos ofrece la posibilidad de amar a Dios y a los que nos rodean, de perdonar a los que nos ofenden, de vivir cristianamente.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Cuándo será el juicio final?<br>  <br>  El mismo Jesucristo nos aclaró que ni siquiera él conoce el día ni la hora en que se llevará a cabo este acontecimiento, sino sólo Dios Padre. Así que no debemos dejarnos enga?ar por personas que pretenden conocer la fecha del fin del mundo. No debemos preocuparnos por intentar conocer esa fecha, sino sólo por estar siempre bien preparados, pues no sabemos en qué momento sucederá.<br>  <br>  Para profundizar, puedes leer el Catecismo de la Iglesia Católica núm. 668 - 682, 1021-1023, 1038-1042, 2831 <br>  <br>  Dios ,os bendiga y les ayude a presentar un buen examen|`|290776c1972acc2f58b1c8260c338071aa	Le responderia que nunca le hice da?o a nadie y que pues nunca fui a la iglesia por que no creo en la iglesia pero que a el siempre lo lleve en mi corazon y que si creo en el por que siempre estuvo alli para darme las cosas por las que tanto suplique.|`|3c8c59419215386e67942a8e74c8d3bfaa	Con ninguno xq simplemente no creo en su existencia !!!<br>  Asi k me mori y punto !!|`|468a0afb7575a848b24cacdf0e931ab3aa	jajajaja soy cerrajero jajajaja soy cerrajjjeeeeero jajajaja|`|53cb092677b511d0e6ab49189f6a951daa	Porque me has amado desde siempre y me has perdonado desde antes de que yo pecara y porque mi corazón se ha arrepentido por cada vez que te falle′.|`|aTxrfWifaa	Cuando morimos llegamos ante Dios para nuestro juicio particular, ahí nada vale solo lo que tu has hecho en la vida terrenal que el se?or te ha dado y que atravéz de su Hijo nos la dio a conocer.<br>  Y ahí en ese momento ya es demaciado tarde para arrepentírte pués Dios te dió toda una vida para hacerlo.<br>  Que su infinita misericordia perdone tus pecados terrenáles. y te reciba en su ceno.|`|bcdb9e4ddb5d59f252bd90f2a47fc8ebaa	Bueno, dado lo teológica de tu pregunta le diría más o menos así: Se?or, sé que he sido pecadora y que no merezco entrar a tu casa, pero también sé que eres misericordioso y que en tu infinita bondad encontrarás lo bueno que hay en esta humilde hija tuya.

Every country seems to have an ethnic cleansing/enslavement/religious crusade past (or in some cases, present) that haunts them. There really isn't much you can do about that... Native Americans receive charters for schools and businesses on their reservations and a Native American card pretty much ensures a free college education.

American has the worse history anywhere in the world. so i say that they beat the Germans hands down|`|AA11649063	The U.S. Government has tried to "put things right" many times, but usually just ends up screwing things up more.<br>  <br>  Native Americans who are members of federally recognized tribes are entitled to benefits based on blood quanta. This is where you get x amount of benefits if you are x much native American. Racist and backwards? Yes. It was an attempt at the federal government to define who was native American and who wasn't though.<br>  <br>  The problem is, there is a limit to how much each tribe gets and the more members the tribe has, the less each person gets.  Also, a person who's mother was from one recognized tribe and who's father was from another, may not be entitled to any benefits because under the laws which dictate blood quanta, they may not be recognized as native American.<br>  <br>  This causes many Native Americans to be hesitant to marry outside of their tribe, which doesn't do much for their population. It also creates a lot of tension within the tribes as people within the same family could be assigned different levels of "native Americans" by blood quanta,  which is always a sensitive topic.<br>  <br>  Most registered tribes are permitted to run casinos. On one hand, these casinos often bring in much needed revenue for the tribe, as they operate as sovereign governments and have no other means to support their infrastructure. For some smaller tribes, it's members can become very wealthy from the casino revenue, but unfortunately, some of these small tribes have taken to kicking out members who fall into disfavor, allowing larger shares of the revenue for the remaining members.<br>  <br>  The government also offers many scholarships for native Americans, but most who live on reservations never make it to college. Many reservations are often poverty stricken with high levels of alcoholism and crystal meth addicts.<br>  <br>  Despite what occurred in the past, native Americans really need to start helping themselves.<br>  <br>  The relationship between Europeans and Native Americans had many faces. It wasn't always the case that they were intentionally being oppressed, though they were more often than not treated unfairly. <br>  <br>  The Nazis, on the other hand, never had any good intentions for the jews. They saw the jews as a threat that the world should be rid of.|`|StylbOaWaa	Britain today is more racist then all before put together,the Muslims live in fear|`|ilRswlR1aa	American history only spans a few hundred years whereas the German people have been around much longer (i.e the Visigoths c 2000 years ago) and I'm sure race was a primary reason for war thoughout the ages.

You HAVE to act by calling the police, then remaining with the victim until your witness report has been written. It's law.

As for your own safety, most times, its best to call 911.  Let the person know you see what going on, and draw more attention to it.

I've actually seen this happen. I was on the bus to the mall once and a group of males started bothering this old man(kinda old, like mid to late 40s or something). They started slapping him on the back of the head, he turned around and gave them a look, one of them got up and said, "What you gonna do about it?!" and the old man just looked down and didn't say anything. I was worried and felt really bad so I got up and got in his face and said, "I'll do something about it." He looked me up and down and scoffed and sat back down with his buddy. I sat across the old man till the guys got off missing my bus stop to the mall. I know how to defend myself but against two guys who were bigger than me would have been really hard but its all about confidence. If a fight had broken out they probably could have taken me down but I acted like a superior fighter so they backed down. It depends on your mentality and how you go about things.

Special care & support is unnecessary when they are given respect and equal opportunity.|`|hieQHR0daa	Children who have difficulties should have appropriate education, care and support to ensure that they are able, as far as possible to lead full and independent lives. <br>  Would people with disabilities prefer the old term "handicapped"? The term "special needs" was supposed to be more inclusive because it recognized that anyone with a disability requires some extra support to live a full and active life in the community.<br>  Inclusion is also a state of mind. If anyone regardless of creed, or ability wants to truly be included in the community they will make every effort to be included. Just as folk who do not want to be included " count themselves out".<br>  We, all of us, at some time in our lives require help of some kind. There is no shame in that, it's a fact of life, just as it is a fact that disabled people are more likely to require specialized help over a slightly longer period.|`|AA10844779	Not all children with a disability need special care, I would say. I was diagnosed at 23 with a mild form of autism, but when I was 13 (10 years before my official diagnosis) a guidance counsellor at school told my mum I had to "go to a special needs school and learn to work in a factory". I'm very grateful to mum for not allowing that, I finished school in regular education just fine, and I'm also working now (and not in a sheltered workplace either).<br>  <br>  However, if a child does need special care, they should be given the necessary support. Some may need it for the rest of their lives, but others may be able to earn how to live independently and find ways to cope with their disability, given the right care and support. <br>  <br>  Special care and support are only so long as they really need it, that is, children shouldn't be dumped in special education just because a teacher doesn't want to deal with them.<br>  <br>  That's my opinion on it anyway...|`|s2aCNJOBaa	Both me and my only child are Disabled PWDs (Persons With Disabilities) by birth and are legitimate medically-legally recognized Disabled PWDs at the local, state, and federal levels and by the Social Security Administration (SSA).<br>  <br>  PWD's including myself and my child ARE normal people who just so happen to have Disabilities. A PWD's needs ARE normal to them and NOT special to them. <br>  <br>  The terms "Special Needs" and "Special Care" is offensive to various PWDS including myself and my child. The terms "Special Needs" and "Special Care" speaks of Segregation, Separation, Isolation, Difference, Being Different, and Not Being Normal. PWDs and Non-PWDs are the SAME and have the SAME basic wants, needs, and desires.<br>  <br>  We PWDs do NOT want to be made to feel different by the usage of the terms "Special Needs" and "Special Care".

In this article, we shall examine said event in an objective and reasonable manner, after which we will respond to the Shia accusations.<br>  <br>  An Overview of the Incident of the Pen and Paper<br>  <br>  The Prophet’s last illness before his final departure from this world lasted around two weeks. During this time, the Prophet’s condition gradually deteriorated and he became bedridden. He experienced a high grade fever, severe headaches, and even fainting spells, slipping into and out of consciousness. The so-called “incident of the pen and paper” occurred four days before the Prophet’s death, on a Thursday. <br>  <br>  The Prophet asked for a pen and paper in order to write down some religious advice for the Muslims. However, immediately after asking for the pen and paper, the Prophet fainted and became unconscious. While the Prophet lay unconscious, a man got up to get the pen and paper, but Umar ibn al-Khattab called him away from doing that. Umar felt that they should not bother the Prophet by asking him to write down religious advice, but rather they should allow the Prophet to regain consciousness, get some rest, and recuperate. Therefore, Umar said to the other Muslims: “The Prophet is seriously ill and you have the Quran; so the Book of Allah is enough for us.” <br>  <br>  Umar ibn al-Khattab thought–and rightfully so–that the request for a pen and paper no longer applied now that the Prophet had fainted. Instead of getting the pen and paper, Umar felt that they should allow the Prophet to rest. However, some of the Sahabah felt that they should get the pen and paper anyways, and that they should implore the Prophet to write for them; these people said: “Bring him (the writing material) so that Allah’s Messenger may write a document for you and you would never go astray after him.”<br>  <br>  Some of the Sahabah felt that they should let the Prophet rest and ask him for religious advice later; others felt that they should have the Prophet write immediately after he came back to consciousness. This led to a dispute amongst the Sahabah, and they began arguing loudly. It was then that the Prophet awoke from his state of unconsciousness, amid loud noises and great clamor. The Prophet had a splitting headache, so this racket upset him greatly. It was due to this loud bickering that the Prophet told those in the room to “go away” and to leave him alone<br>  <br>  Simple Explanation<br>  <br>  It is amazing how much drama the Shia propagandists can create, and how easily they can misguide people. The explanation to this event is so simple and straightforward that it is very strange that the Shia do not understand this! All that we must do is ask the Shia to correlate the event to their own lives, which more often than not makes impotent their arguments. Ask a Shia for example if he would tolerate a man cursing his wife, and he would say no; then we wonder why they themselves curse the wife of the Prophet! Likewise, when it comes to the incident of the pen and paper, we ask them to correlate the event to their own lives. <br>  <br>  read more, it is very informative<br>  <a href="http://www.ahlelbayt.com/articles/sahabah/pen-and-paper" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahlelbayt.com/articles/sahaba...</a><br>  <br>  @Edit<br>  <br>  exactly.<br>  you answered your own Q.<br>  <br>  if Allah wanted the prophet peace be upon him, no one can or could or even dare to prevent that from happening.<br>  <br>  actually if you keep repeating these lies, you are accusing Islam of not being complete, and a incomplete religion is not good to be the last religion, and a prophet that couldn't deliver his message (the Holy Quran says that he delivered it perfectly) is not good enough to be the last prophet sent by God to all mankind, yes???<br>  <br>  oh, no answer for my "simple Q" in your "simple Q"??|`|Pbj8Ymgxaa	Yes, I am familiar with that hadith. A mistake was made, but why must you blow it out of proportion and act like it was an act of kufr.  Umar (ra) did not want the prophet to strain himself, he had good intentions. He was not infallible like you claim your Imams to be.  It's not like he was trying to sabotage anything like you Shiites make it seem. Everything happens for a reason.  5alas, you people are annoying.

Umar called out to Akraan who was in the house of 'Ali, but he refused to come out. Umar then said:<br>  <br>  'I swear by He who controls the life of Umar, if you people do not come out of the house I shall set fire to it, and everyone inside shall perish. The people said 'Abu'l Hafs (Umar), Fatima (daughter of Rasulullah (s)) is also in this house'. Umar replied, 'I do not care about this, people should leave the house of 'Ali and give bayya'. 'Ali replied I have sworn that I shall not set foot outside my home until I have completed compiling the Qur'an.'<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  @asker<br>  <br>  <br>  why do you only see the good side of things?<br>  <br>  i open my eye.......<br>  ......see the good and bad they have dobe<br>  and chose my path......<br>  <br>  i don't close my eyes on one side and only see the other side........<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  how will YOU answer to Allah SWT when he asks you "why did you follow the killers of ahl-ul-bait?"<br>  <br>  will you say there was no proof?<br>  <br>  well maybe you should look up and "Read"......<br>  <br>  96:1<br>  "Read in the name of your Lord Who created."|`|xTRMSm7yaa	this link has sources from Sunni books that say Yazid (La3een) killed Imam Hussain(as) this  isnt the 1st time we give u proof either....everyday we give u guys proof...every single day.....and yet u turn around and call it "Shia fabricated lies" <br>  <br>  its ur fault that ur not understanding, cause you reject everything we give you....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you ask...<br>  we answer....<br>  you reject....<br>  <br>  so how can u blame us than?|`|4JvCeTm1aa	I have to agree with Pedram...<br>  by asking these kinds of questions u just make urself look bad...<br>  <br>  and the Quran says...<br>  <br>  Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).

423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	It is stated in Minhaj al Sadiqin that Prophet Dawud (A.S) had nineteen sons, and every one of them wanted to inherit his father's kingdom. Allah (S.W.T) sent Dawud (A.S) nine questions with answers and asked him to appoint the son who gives the correct answers as his successor. <br>  <br>  Which is the nearest thing?<br>  Hereafter.<br>  <br>  Which is the farthest thing?<br>  Time passed away<br>  <br>  What phenomenon manifests love?<br>  Body with soul.<br>  <br>  What phenomenon manifests dread?<br>  Body without soul.<br>  <br>  Which things remain the same?<br>  Sky and earth.<br>  <br>  Which things ever remain different?<br>  Day and night.<br>  <br>  Which things are opposed to each other?<br>  Life and death.<br>  <br>  What ends in goodness?<br>  Patience and forbearance at the time of anger.<br>  <br>  What ends in evil?<br>  Haste at the time of anger<br>  <br>  None save Sulayman (A.S), the youngest son, gave the correct answers, so he was made the heir of Dawud (A.S). <br>  <br>  ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------<br>  <br>  The law of inheritance stated in this verse is the law of the Lord, and no one can ever make changes in the laws of the Lord save Himself or the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.W) under His command (Bani Israil : 77). Now refer to the commentary of Bani Israil : 26; Nahl: 90 and Maryam: 2 to 15 for the issue of Fadak. To deprive Bibi Fatimah (S.A) of her rightful inheritance a false tradition (The prophets of Allah (S.W.T) neither inherit nor leave inheritance) was quoted. The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.W) was a law-giver, therefore he could never break any law made by Allah (S.W.T). He was the best exemplar of the laws and doctrines preached by him. <br>  <br>  The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.W) said: <br>  <br>  "Whenever you hear a tradition attributed to me, compare it with the Quran, and, if there is no contradiction between the two, accept it, otherwise reject it outright." <br>  <br>  Dawud (A.S) who chose Sulayman (A.S), a prophet, to inherit his kingdom was also a prophet, therefore the tradition quoted to deprive Bibi Fatimah (S.A) of her rightful inheritance was undoubtedly false. Please note that the superior most prophet of Allah (S.W.T), Muhammad al Mustafa (S.A.W.W), was granted all the wisdom, knowledge and authority over all created beings which was given to other prophets, in the highest degree by the most generous giver of all givers.|`|KqiiT1WSaa	1) Wives of the prophet have there own property, remember Khadijah (ra) was a successful trader.<br>  <br>  2) The wives of the prophet were not prophets.<br>  <br>  3) sadaqah and personal propert are two different things.<br>  <br>  AGAIN this is a very pointless question<br>  <br>  WAW u seriously don't get it do you.<br>  <br>  look at point number 2<br>  <br>  2) the wives of the prophet are not prophets, neither is the daughter of the prophet a prophet.|`|hwsunYCAaa	What the wives possesed(ummahat al Momneen) is their posession not the prophet's(s).This will not be called sadaqah but what they were possesing.& what Rasulullah(s) possesed went to bayt maal al muslemeen like his horse, camel, sword, ..... <br>  <br>  evidence:"??? ????? ???????? ?? ???? ?? ?????? ????

Blackland Farmer was a really popular song back in the fifties and all of us were just about that or, we were busy growing up on a Justapore Ranch. Yep, when the Lord made me he made a simple man, with not much money and not much land. Google, Blackland Farmer, and you can become familiar with a piece me and my foundation.

Alhamdulillah.|`|6LBJgACSaa	Yes the first time was when I began practicing Islam, I had an Islamic dream and when I woke up my Iman Subhan’Allah dramatically increased. When I listen to Qu’ran especially Maher Al Mu’aqily and Muhammad Al Barrak.

dtRkn4Jlaa	Assalamoalikum,<br>  <br>  Its not that scholars are wrong or that we shouldn't go to them for advice and to learn something. But the thing is that Allah has given the Quran and Muhammad SAW as our guide to living and doing everything. It is very easy to follow the Quran and Muhammad SAW, but its just that people like to make it hard. There is a hadith, Muhammad SAW has said that Allah dislikes three things: people who backbite, people who ask too many questions and people who waste wealth. So when you learn that something has been ordered in the quran by Allah and learn the it is a sunnah, than u follow it. But the sad thing is that people nowadays do not like some of the rules, like backbiting, if you tell people that back that backbiting is not allowed, they will say i was saying this for that person's good and all that. So people nowadays do not like to follow commands which goes against their own desires and than they go to scholars to see if the command can somehow not applying to them. And if the scholar agrees with them, they say since the scholar has said it, its true and we can now not follow the quran, and if the scholar doesn't agree, they continue searching till they find someone. <br>  <br>  It is a sad fact that we, the muslims are no longer interested in following the commands of Allah, rather we love to follow the commands of our desires, be it they go against Allah and his commands. Scholars are people we should go to learn more about issues, but not to find ways to not follow commands. But many people go to find ways to not follow commands and it is a sad thing that nowadays there are many scholars who rather than say follow this rule go around to find exceptions to the rule. May Allah guide everyone to the right path. Amen|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	Hmmm...it depends. Sometimes there are verses in the Quran that have been aborgated, and other times, some ahadith are overriden by stronger ones. You can't really blanket statement this. Islam has left alot of room for exceptions and contingencies, I guess that's what makes it the best religion on earth: the most adaptable according to differing circumstances and conditions.|`|hl6lDPvDaa	seven minutes and six seconds, sorry but that video is too long. <br>  <br>  May Allah(swt) save us all, ameen.|`|XCTUmHPLaa	jazakiAllah sis,<br>  <br>  this man is mashaAllah!|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	I agree. But the background noise was very distracting. My friend's giving me her bible :D coz I asked her how much one would cost. It's true though. People neglect the Quran and Sunnah and rely on scholars, and that's not really accurate. <br>  <br>  I think scholars are still important. But you need to make some effort, and you can't always rely on scholars. They tend to differ in their opinions. I say you look at what scholars say, then you go and research it for yourself and take into account what they say, but make your own decision upon that.|`|vwFf2ftcaa	lion of Ali is mad............<br>  <br>  <br>  utube is blocked:-(<br>  <br>  don't worry sis,,,,I will check it out 2nite InshaAllaah, I love Imam Anwar may Allaah(swt) preserve him.

kkO87h0Xaa	No. I never had riches in my life. My life has always been filled with hardships, but Allah (swt) was always there for me. I am thankful for every little thing He gave me. He gave me the sustenance I needed during hard times, and in turn I need him. No matter what my situation is, He will always come first. My love for Him is way too immense to not worship Him in every way I can.<br>  <br>  It just feels so right, and amazing.|`|kUNhq931aa	Because He gave me life.<br>  <br>  He gave me everything that I have in my life. And if He took it all away, I would still say Alhamdulilah. Because He loves me enough to have put a soul into my body.<br>  <br>  Allah SWT loves all, and is All-Forgiving, and Most-Compassionate...that's a good reason in my opinion.|`|AA11791540	He is my creator. and i don't own any gold. and all this is the beauty of this life, and God has saved paradise for his believers and give this life as a paradise to the disbelievers.|`|4aveC2aaaa	because i owe Allah everything<br>  because Allah told us to obey Him and none other than Him|`|5ofS2qQYaa	actually, I prefer RamaRoti...but thanks for offering<br>  :D<br>  <br>  Allah(swt) gives me peace of heart and mind and purpose in life<br>  and I am nothing, not even the clay of the earth, w/o Allah(swt) !<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Allah(swt) knows best

541a474ab7a5993c12cad8067af53dc7aa	I DONT THINK THAT MAKES U AN ELITIST JUST UNREALISTIC. THERE ARE PROLLY ALOT OF GUYS OUT THERE WHO WOULD BE GREAT 4 U THAT U ARE MISSING OUT ON. U R BOXING YOURSELF IN. MAYBE THEY CAN GIVE U A NEW APPRECIATION 4 THEIR MUSIC, AND U CAN DO THE SAME WITH YOURS. THIS IS THE WIKIPEDIA VERSION OF ELITIST Elitism is the belief or attitude that those individuals who are considered members of the elite—a select group of people with outstanding personal abilities, intellect, wealth, specialized training or experience, or other distinctive attributes—are those whose views on a matter are to be taken the most seriously or carry the most weight; whose views and/or actions are most likely to be constructive to society as a whole; or whose extraordinary skills, abilities or wisdom render them especially fit to govern.[1] Alternatively, the term elitism may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of the elite. Those opposed to elitism are considered supporters of anti-elitism, populism or the political theory of pluralism. Elite theory is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society - elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal.|`|pVhQOAznaa	If you see you and your friends/peer group/sub culture/race/other such group as somehow superior to everyone else and the only people worth talking to, punks for example, often they will only socialise with other punks (I'm not saying all punks, i know some lovely punks).|`|7fvUQbC2aa	You have the right to ostracize anyone you want.
8A7aPVf3aa	Are you living in Japan? Find a native teacher to give you lessons focusing on pronunciation ONLY. It's very natural for non-native speakers to have an accent (people from all English speaking countries sound different, too, don't they?). So the fact that you have an accent does NOT mean you are not fluent. It's ok to have an accent!<br>  <br>  But if you really want to have native-like pronunciation you have to focus on that very hard. I used to teach from a book called 'Pronunciation Pairs.' It was a book for non-native speakers, but all the lessons focused on some pronunciation point. Usually there would be two similar sounds (r/l) and there would be exercises so you could hear the difference. It's important to have a native speaker model the sounds for you. And when you make the sounds really STRETCH your mouth, lips, tongue, etc. to make the sound. It will feel very strange, but you MUST really stretch the mouth until it feels natural.<br>  <br>  Also, NEVER use katakana as a basis for how to say a word.|`|2ea3b1109a1954597d6e6877c0d98075aa	I think your best plan is to actually live in an English speaking environment to neutralise your accent, because once you are engaging in conversation with native English speakers you will naturally pick up the accent, however long you wish to spend there is up to you, my dad is Italian he has lived in the UK for over 20 years and he sounds completely English...<br>  <br>  I mean you would never guess he was a native Italian, of course thats over a long period of time, however for yourself you may pick up the English accent quicker, you can get rid of an accent, but you need to live in an English speaking area, or just move to England for a while, its your best option!!! Other than that watch alot of English films, buy courses on CD, anything to expose yourself to the accent and learn the words, say them over and over until you are confident it sounds near perfect, it takes alot of practice and dedication.<br>  <br>  I know its frustrating but you will feel more confident about your speech and vocabulary in time, I promise, and people will understand you :)
h46Oxo95aa	Nope, they are not considered muslim. Unless the believe in the shahadda. But a true muslim who believes in  the shahadda don't really act that way.They aren't following islam they way they are supposed to follow. All they have is the name of a muslim.|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	Yes. But he is considered a Fasiq. A transgressor. His punishment and salvation lie with Allah. A person only becomes a disbeliever when they negate a tenant in Islam that is necessary for belief to be present in the heart of a believer. The shias are one example...they call a human God(Ali) when in reality Allah is unlike the creation, and others believe that Ali is the messenger (Muhammed was the final one), and others curse the companions, (people that Allah said in the Quran: I am pleased with them, and I love them. And several of those companions that are cursed were given the news by the prophet that they would enter Jannah in their lives.)|`|ILc1XIPraa	Unless they are sincerely repenting and changing their actions , they are kafr. It's not only saying you are muslim which makes you a muslim.

TxIE5IX8aa	According to the Qur'an yes. But not enough to become worthy of heaven.<br>  <br>  Muslim is just a name. Some people are just Muslim by name and not by actions.|`|gDr6c4hraa	Praise be to Allah<br>  <br>  "ASH-HADU ANLAA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH WA ASH HADUANNAMUHAMMADANABDUHUWA RASUULUH."<br>  <br>  The English translation is:<br>  <br>  "I bear witness that there is no deity worthy to be worshipped but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger."<br>  <br>  However, it would not be sufficient for anyone to utter only this testimony orally either in private or in public. One should believe in it from the heart with a firm conviction and unshakable faith. If he is truly sincere and complies with the teachings of Islam in his daily life he will find himself a newborn person.<br>  <br>  This will move him to strive more and more to improve his character and draw nearer to perfection. The light of the living faith will fill his heart until he becomes the embodiment of that faith.<br>  <br>  What should be next after declaring the testimony of faith (Shahada) and then becoming a Muslim? He should know the real concept underlying this testimony, which means accepting the Oneness of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), as the last of the Prophets, and meeting its requirements. He must behave accordingly applying this true faith to everything he says or does. What do the words of "Shahada" signify.<br>  <br>  The significant point which every Muslim must know is the truth that there is no god to be worshipped other than Allah, (Glory be to Him). He is the only true God, Who Alone deserves to be worshipped, since He is the Giver of life and Sustainer and Nourisher of mankind and all creation with His unlimited bounties. Man must worship Allah, Who Alone is worthy of worship.<br>  <br>  The second part of the "Shahada" i.e. "Wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh" means that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the servant and chosen messenger of Allah. No one should be in any doubt about this matter. In fact, the Muslim has to obey the commands of the Prophet (PBUH), to believe in what he has said, to follow his Teachings, to avoid what he has forbidden, and to worship A11ah alone according to the message revealed to him.<br>  <br>  What is the meaning of worship? It simply means rendering sincere service; showing reverence for Allah. In a deeper shade of meaning, it implies total submission and complete obedience to Allah's Commandments both in utterances and actions, whether explicit or implicit and in private or public.<br>  <br>  Worship falls into two categories:<br>  <br>  1. Visible (manifest or outward) 2. Invisible (concealed or inward)<br>  <br>  Visible worship includes acts such as uttering the two parts of the "shahada", performing prayers, giving Zakat (obligatory charity), observing the fast in the month of Ramadan, performing Hajj, recitation of the Holy Qur'an, supplication, adoring Allah by praising Him, purifying our bodies before prayers, etc.<br>  <br>  This type of worship is associated with the movement of the parts of human body, [actions].<br>  <br>  Invisible worship is to believe in Allah, in the Day of Judgment, in the Hereafter, in the Angels, in the Books of Allah, in the Divine Decree of destiny (that good and bad are determined by Allah alone)<br>  <br>  This type of worship does not involve movements of parts of the body but it surely has a bearing on one's heart which, subsequently, affects one's way of life (beliefs).<br>  <br>  It should be borne in mind that worship not dedicated to Allah alone, will be rejected as one form of polytheism or "shirk", which amounts to apostasy, from the Islamic point of view.<br>  <br>  The next step for a devotee newly converted to Islam is to purify himself by taking a bath (total ablution). He should then resolve to comply with all the principles and rules of Islam in their entirety. He disowns all forms of polytheism and false beliefs. He should reject evil and be righteous. Such rejection of evil and being righteous is one of the requisites of the motto of Islam that is, Lailaha Illal Laah.<br>  <br>  Allah has stated in the Holy Qur'an:<br>  <br>  "... whoever disbelieves in false deities and believes in Allah, hath grasped the most trustworthy handhold, that will never break..." (2:256)<br>  <br>  We have to consider that when we declare from our hearts, "there is no god worthy to be worshipped but Allah." It implies on our part of love, devotion, faith and obedience to the rules of Islamic legislation which are legally binding on all Muslims. It is a requirement of "there is no god worthy to be worshipped but Allah," to love for the sake of Allah and to reject for the sake of Allah. This is the finest anchor of belief which make material the meaning of "AL-WALA" and "AL-BARA". It means that a Muslim should love and be loyal to his Muslim brothers. He should, as a practice, dissociate himself completely from the practices of unbelievers and refuse to be influenced by them, both in worldly and religious matters.<br>  <br>  We conclude with a humble prayer to Allah that He may cleanse the hearts and souls of those who are genuine seekers of truth and may He bless the community of believers. Ameen.<br>  <br>  Allah knows best|`|1ZVtTII8aa	you have to believe in the shahadah , and the unseen, you have to believe and the five pillars and the holy books :)<br>  <br>  I think I can guess what you're actually leading to *rolls eyes*<br>  <br>  xx<br>  <br>  @ Pedram-I knew someone was gonna bring that up, didn't think it would be you....o_O|`|ILc1XIPraa	To become one yes.

So in the first sentence they would be printed and required and handed (or could be handed, depending on what the teacher is looking for)  Adverbs are words that describe the verb.  For example:  If you said I walked slowly.  Walked would be the verb.  Slowly describes how I walked so that would be the adverb.

Al-Hussain bin Ali came out to war despite the small number of his followers at a time when he could have made peace. This tells us that one of them was right and the other was wrong because:<br>  <br>      If Al-Hassan's concession with the ability to fight was right, then Al-Hussain's war with lack of means was wrong.<br>  <br>      If Al-Hussain's war with lack of means was right, then Al-Hassan's concession with the ability to fight was wrong.<br>  <br>      And this puts you in a place where no one can envy you. Because if you say that both of them are right, you agree to two opposite things and this destroys your roots and logic.<br>  <br>      So if you say that Al-Hussain's action was wrong then you have to believe in the falsehood of his leadership "Imamah" and the falsehood of the leadership of his father and his infallibility. Because he was given a trust and the infallible leader does not give the trust to anyone but an infallible like him. And if you say that Al-Hassan's action was wrong then you have to believe in the falsehood of his leadership "Imamah" and the falsehood of the leadership of his children and progeny because he is the root of their leadership and through him came the leadership. And if the root is wrong, then the branches are all wrong.<br>  <br>      And we say to every Shia:<br>  <br>      Regardless of what you answer to this conundrum, your answer is not convincing for this reason:<br>  <br>      You would believe that Ali accepted to himself what the low Bedouins of the Arabs would not accept for themselves and he is from the Prophet's family? And I repeat the question to you, if Umar's shortcomings are like what you describe then how would Ali accept him as a husband to his daughter? So do the Shia put Ali in a class that's lower than the Bedouins (since Bedouins won't accept this shame for themselves)? And would Al-Hussain accept this? Or would Al-Hasan accept this?<br>  <br>      And if you accept that, then they are less class than the Bedouin of Arabs! and that is not acceptable to us. The issue is that you make up accusations against Umar bin Al-Khattab and then you want us to accept an excuse which is worse than the sin itself. And your excuse is Taqiyya. So was it for Taqiyya that Ali married his daughter off to Umar? You curse Umar, make up bad things about him, and allege that he was an apostate, then after all that you want to claim that Ali was a coward too? This is not acceptable to us for Umar nor for Ali. And if Umar in your opinion is an Infidel and you claim that Ali knew that, then why did he marry him off to his daughter?!<br>  <br>      The whole thing is illogical completely. If the Sahaba (companions of the Prophet) were really apostates, as you claim, then did Ali use Taqiyyah instead of fighting them? If using Taqiyyah is the right thing to do, then why did Ali fight the infidels during the time of the Prophet instead of using Taqiyyah to end the matter? If the Kuffar's land was a land of war (Dar Harb), then the Muslim land -under Abu Bakr and Umar- is for sure a land of war as well. In the land of the Kuffar, the infidels used to be fought and calls for war were called. And in the Muslim land under Abu Bakr and Umar, as you claim it to be a land of war, you consider the Rightly Guided Khalifas infidels just like you consider Yazeed and even worse. Don't you consider them Murtadeen (apostates)? Then what is Ali's duty? To get along with this one and be submissive to others? Would the Imam Ali submit to an infidel (as you claim) who took the mother of Mohammad bin Al-Hanafiyah (the son of Imam Ali bin Abi Talib) as a woman prisoner during the time of Abu Bakr (who in your opinion is an unfair oppressor)?  According to Shia Fiqh, everything that an oppressor does and all his rulings are invalid. So why did Imam Ali take that woman and have a child from her? This is an insult to the Imam form your side.<br>  <br>      If you compare Ali with Ammar, then you should remember that Ali's class is much higher than Ammar's since Ali's position to the Prophet was like the status of Haroon to Musa, isn't that what you say? Then how do you compare this to that? And despite all that, it was an exception for Ammar to be used only in times of necessity. But for you, it is a religion and a creed. It is a profession rather than a hobby. Doesn't one of your sayings say "Taqiyya is my religion and the religion of my fathers and grandfathers"? Then it is a religion and not an exception. It is a creed and a root and not a special case. So would Ali submit to the infidels? and would he marry his daughter off to an infidel? and would Ali accept to himself what the lowest of Arabs would never accept? And is there an insult worse than submitting to the infidels? And is there is any more humiliation than marrying his daughter of to a pervert who allegedly hit and caused his wife, Fatimah, to miscarriage? Wouldn't you declare war against him? And you also claim that Umar used to drink Alcohol? And you curse him and accuse him of more insults than that but you still expect Ali to submit to him?<br>  <br>  Then why did Imam Ali go to war against the Kuffar if he was going to submit to the alleged apostates? Then who is supposed to fight against the oppressors and the apostates? And you say that Ammar was given an excuse by the messenger? There were no Ayahs from the Quran about Ammar's leadership as you claim for Ali. And he will not be considered an Imam by you at any case. And he does not carry a responsibly like the responsibility of Ali as you say. This is because Ammar was led but did not lead. And Ali lead, but you claim that he cannot be lead. He was a leader, not a follower. However, he submitted once to Abu Bakr, once to Umar, and once to Uthman and they were all apostates as you claim! Your Taqiyya is a rubber that extends here and shrinks there! You give it to Ammar when he was under torture while it was an exception for one time only. And for Imam Ali, the free man and the brave war hero, you used it to justify his submission to Abu Bakr and then his submission to Umar. Then you used it again to explain his submission to Uthman. Then once again, it was used as a justification for him marrying his daughter Umm Kulthoom to Umar. And again it was used to justify Ali taking Umm Mohammad bin Al-Hanafyeh even though she was a war prisoner and the ruler was an oppressor.  This is not allowed in Shia Jurisprudence at all. So it is actually an admittance of the leadership of Abu Bakr. Then what was Ali's duty in the first place if he did not fight oppression and injustice? This is basically the truth of your words.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	Open Question<br>  Show me another ?<br>  Serious question.

LqwlAMJsaa	You clog your friend's toilet: what should you do?<br>  <br>  As embarassing as this is, you can be sure that every person has clogged a toilet at least once in his life. And it's not always your fault. People like to joke that it means you took a big dump, but sometimes a toilet might clog just from a bit of toilet paper, if the apparatus is damaged or faulty. Or, it might have been quirky from before you used it, and your flush was the one that pushed it over the edge, so to speak. I've been to a lot of parties where the toilet wouldn't flush, or sometimes even overflowed, because having hundreds of people streaming in and out of the bathroom without giving the bowl a chance to empty out and fill up just screws up the system.<br>  <br>  So what would I do?<br>  <br>  First of all,I would remember that this unfortunate situation has probably happened to everyone at least once. <br>  <br>  Second, I would be glad that this didn't happen at the house of a boy you like! It could be much worse.<br>  <br>  But no matter what, I would tell my friend-- it's not like you could just leave it like that and walk out. After all, someone's going to walk in there and be like "WTF???" and then EVERYONE will know it was you.<br>  <br>   I once went on a ski trip with 2 girl friends and 4 good-looking guys from the bball team. We slept in my friend's parents' cabin, and when we woke up there was  a HUGE EXPLOSION of shiit in the toilet. it was totally disgusting. No one would admit having done it, but we suspected that it was one of the guys. The point is that if the culprit had told my friend when it happened, it would have stayed private, but instead it became this huge scandalous mystery the next morning.<br>  <br>  After a few minutes-- or as soon as the plumber left-- everyone would forget about it.<br>  <br>  FYI, You've GOT to check out the movie "Along Came Polly." This movie is pretty funny in general and it has a HILARIOUS scene in which the main character, suffering from terrible diarrhea, accidentally clogs the toilet of a woman on their FIRST DATE. Watch this and you'll feel much better about your own situation (if this indeed happened to you).|`|XU1KaWXwaa	hmm stick my arms and legs in and have a bath lol<br>  nah i would say sorry ur toilets hole is too small.|`|AA10378447	Just ask for a plunger, geesh.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	It will go down eventually but I would ask for a plunger. If they have not got one I would wait for a while and roll up my sleeves even take my shirt off and use my hand. Not nice. If that does not work and even if it does get a bucket ful od hot water and chuck it in hard. it is suprising how often that works and then throw a couple of buckets of cold down to make sure. <br>  <br>  Wash you hands, arms and scub your nails very carefully. <br>  <br>  I've only ever had to do this with my own bog and it is not a pleasant experience, but life goes on.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	This happens to everyone I would go tell my friend that you need a plunger  b/c you really can't hide the fact that it happened anyway it's no big deal|`|GqfiRXu3aa	"Sorry, man.  Your toilet's clogged up and I can't find a plunger."|`|3852ea6a87816cc1b0c099b36909031baa	Be proud, I mean honestly if you have the ability to launch in someone elses house, which I might add is always a hard thing for me. Something about not being on my own throne that creeps me out, but that said, be proud!!!! Walk out and loudly state that you blew it up and the friends pansy powered bowl will not suck it down, maybe the friend will finally go out and buy a plunger then!|`|RGIkYercaa	tell myself "oh sh1t" and try to think of what do do, I would try to take some of the stuff that's blocking the toilet and put it in a bin (if there was one in the bathroom). And flush it afterwards.|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Actually been there !! how embarrassing!! i must have flushed it 10 times before it cleared!! and each drain down to safe level to flush again must have been 10 minutes!!! They did ask where i'd been to which i simply replied..."Your toilet was playing up!!"|`|rFXt8ygGaa	o **** u would hav to bit ur teeth and put ur hand down a pull out what ever it is blockin it dump it in the bin and hope the water gose down oya and wash ur hands like forever and ever|`|c6g92RRVaa	walk away and say nothing lol<br>  i know that isn't good manners but i would be embarressed and the toilet would eventually empty before they saw it. would be easier than having your best mate trying to plunge your huge monster log!|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	There could be something much more clogging the toilet.  I would call to somebody outside of the bathroom to find a plunger.|`|yoS4cAszaa	I don't know, but that situation would suck.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	If you saw that it was clogged, why would you flush it more then once?  You said by now it is filled to the rim, that would not happen if you flushed it only once( unless of course this is a very small toilet).  If we are indeed talking about a rather small toilet, then I could say that situation would suck.  However, If were talking about a normal sized toilet, I would of used the plunger( if they had one) after the first flush( if I saw that it was clogged)  If they have no plunger, you'll probably have to tell them.<br>  <br>  Water in a toilet doesn't build up that quickly, unless you flushed it more then once. <br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, well then that's a bummer.|`|FbKrzNL9aa	Pull the stuff from as far back into the toilet as you can get, then throw it in the garbage. You still may not be able to flush even then, but at least it has the appearance of being flushed (or that you at least didn't leave a mess).|`|AA11346983	i'd just say, 'err..i think there's something wrong with your toilet..'<br>  if it was a really good friend, then you could probably just joke about it i guess. but still pretty embarrassing haha.|`|dvgj6q6xaa	Stop ducking your responsibility and tell your friend about it and offer to help fix the problem.|`|swQz4R2Iaa	Pray that the water goes back down lol

I5pUxwPbaa	snakes cannot hear, so the instrument they play has nothing to do with charming them with music. the swaying of the flute (not sure what its called) distracts the snake temporarily and the snake follows the swaying flute making it look like its dancing. Also, it's hard for a snake to bite a moving target which is why the person keeps moving thereby avoiding getting bitten

Here another report is quoted which is found in Britain that indicate that the skies wept blood for Imam Hussein (AS) everywhere:<br>  <br>  “685.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	You gave a lot of details but you forgot to mention why the wife is not working.  In my home it takes TWO incomes.  Neither of us can be without work.  I don't have the luxury of not working.  Is the wife disabled and receiving SSDI?  If so, the kids would have health care.  Is the wife attending school to get a good job?<br>  <br>  Also, this family is below the poverty line so the kids would be eligible for Medicaid.<br>  <br>  I disagree that it is cheaper to eat healthy.  A trip to McDonald's for a family of 6 would cost at least $30.  How many fresh vegetables do you think you could get for $30?  A lot more than one meal.  The cost per pound for junk food is very high when compared to fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  I think there should be a time limit on HUD.  No more than three years.  Many people get HUD housing and live on it for decades.<br>  <br>  I think that people who choose to have children should expect to fully support them.  You didn't really mention if this couple were on the dole when they decided to have all of these kids or not.  You also didn't mention if this family has been on the dole for 6 months or 6 years.  It matters to me.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who is carrying her 7th child.  Her family has never been on any type of government assistance because her husband had a great job.  After she got pregnant with this child, he was downsized.  He hasn't found any work in 6 months.  (He's getting unemployment but I don't consider that welfare since his company has been paying the premiums to the state for many years)  They're trying hard and looking for anything but the area where they live has been hit extra hard by this economy.  They hate taking assistance but they have to.  I'm okay with the government giving them a hand up.  If they stay on that assistance for a couple years, then that will be another story.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Well, don't be judging all poor people, please.<br>  <br>  At least in your example the guy has a job. It's not like he isn't working at all. <br>  <br>  As for the health care, it's for the children. What happens if they get seriously ill and have to miss a week of school? <br>  <br>  As for the food, those are the only things they can afford. They can't exactly buy ORGANIC food, now can they? It's expensive to eat healthy.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	You act as if that is the only situation in existence.<br>  You have obviously never been in such dire straights or you would see how misinformed your question is.<br>  <br>  Try BEING THAT POOR before you hold up an isolated example and claim that is represents every (or even most) people in that situation.|`|c8lBbWtQaa	Try walking a mile in someone Else's shoes, before you judge.

At least he is trying to earn money.|`|68VsaQTraa	I'll all for helping the weak in society, not the lazy. <br>  <br>  These people need a kick in the **** not benefits|`|s6GKHKccaa	So do you actually think the only people on welfare are the ones who abuse it?<br>  <br>  <br>  Granted there are people who abuse the system, but there are also those who really need that kind of help. I personally know a single mom with two kids (who's children's father does NOT pay child support) that has a crappy beat down old car, only has a part time job at Wal-Mart (which only pays $8.00 per hour, not enough to live off of even with 40 hours per week), lives in a crappy area, and still does not have enough money to spend on herself because she's struggling to provide for her children clothes (so other kids don't make fun of them and, bully them), and food on the table so they don't starve.<br>  <br>  Walk a mile in someones shoes before passing judgment with sweeping generalizations.

While, sure, there may be the rare, exceptional person who doesn't change all too much, most of us will change, because most societies are based on money, wealth, property, etc. <br>  When you have it, different doors open to you than when you're poor or even upper middle class.<br>  Part of the problem is external -- the people are around that newly rich person get jealous/envious and want some of that money. And the newly rich person has to deal with who their real friends are. And, quite often, family members will also start setting their eyes on that money.<br>  So, even if the rich person doesn't change on his/her own, outside forces will change that person.<br>  Now, on an individual basis, most people change because with wealth comes greater access to parts of society he/she didn't have access before. <br>  Also, they can get special treatment simply because of their wealth, not who they are.<br>  Studies show that people with less money are more considerate of others. They try better to get along with other people, even strangers.<br>  But it's shown that wealthy people don't have to appease or please others, and that they interact more coldly and arrogantly with people with less money because they don't need anything from those people.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I  think it depends on the person if you were raised with a silver spoon in your mouth you wouldn't know what it's to struggle but if you just came into a windfall I don't think it would change dramatically who you're I'm not saying that I wouldn't be more happy  & have peace of mind but I don't think it would ever spoil me|`|Vv465eJMaa	Of course it does,but everyone knows this but everyone wants more.This is because we get our self worth by climbing above others.Humans are intrinsically selfish and self absorbed.The world must have been nice when there was only vegetation and animals around|`|ZD7kkiyAaa	Yes.

There's less contrast between the letters in each word (because all the letters are the same size, rather than varied sizes, like in lower case (ex/ l, d, c, y VS LDCY). Also, it's harder to detect punctuation and sentence breaks because you don't have the signal of one capital letter at the start of a sentence.

PyYr734Yaa	A lot of people think that a ghostly encounter is all about odd visuals. For example: Seeing a woman float down a hall. However, most of the spiritual/ghostly encounters I've heard of(including my own) are just a presence. ..like a physical presence or intense feeling of being watched/hovered over/spoken to. I've probably encountered more than the average person. To name a few... When I was around 4(my parents later informed me) that I was sitting up in my bed talking to a corner of the ceiling. My parents tried to get my attention but couldn't. Finally, when they were able to break my "trance like state" I told them that I had been talking to Jesus. This could be seen as just weird childhood behavior except for the fact that years later when we rented out that house, the tenant called asking about the plumbing but also mentioned that her 2 year old son seemed to be obsessed with talking to this same corner of the ceiling and asked if we knew of anyone who had died in that house. Also, I have been picked up by the shoulders while reading and nearly shaken off of my bunk bed. My mom has been violently slapped in the face while watching TV.|`|iekMDUqVaa	uhh me?<br>  no im just kidding.<br>  i havent i dont even know if there real.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I prefer to call them spirits, but I have encountered many along the way.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they come to inform me of something, other times they have info for another person they want me to deliver.

We do it as a secular holiday, for my kids they get to dress up and go trick or treating. <br>  I honestly dont see why not.  It's not as you're celebrating any pagan ritual... if it's just dressing up for the sake of dressing up then it's OK.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Halloween didn't exist when that book was written. Let people have some fun ! I'd prefer death over following a 2,000 year old book that has nothing to do with me.|`|pvosPN40aa	If you do some research on the origins of Halloween, you will see that it has origins long before Christian times. Halloween started with the Celts. At the end of the year celebration, Halloween, which was at the end of harvest time, the Celts would make bond fires to ward of evil spirits. On the festival of Shamhain, the veil between spirit and human world would part, souls of dead thought to return to homes and families would leave food and drink for them to ward off misfortune. That was a very general explination of Halloweens origin, I would encourage you to look into it deeper for yourself. (2Corinthians 6:14-16)<br>  (Deuteronomy 18: 10-12)|`|jLL7sDILaa	Halloween was originally pagan, yes. But the religious parts of it have been so removed in Halloween that I think you're fine. Now it's just about dressing up and candy. :)|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Technically, it is sacriligeous to celebrate Christmas, as it is not the actual day of Christ's birth.|`|geuF7GsHaa	yes, god wants us to have fun, but just belive in him and not the devil.|`|eb9401df5c8ac4cc865dd2eadfe7e0acaa	Yes it is<br>  for one Halloween celebrations are party's and dressing up<br>  now if your doing rituals for Halloween that would not be ok but as far as dressing up going to a party or going trick or treating or handing out candy there's nothing wrong with that.|`|zfGJ3YD3aa	i don't have any proof but i'm pretty sure that it is because just about everyone i know is a christian and they all have halloween parties and stuff =/|`|vIXttNHGaa	its fine. halloween used to be a religious (?) holiday, so sure. <br>  ~c.~|`|VQZAxF5Laa	there is nothing bad about dressing up, hanging out with friends, collecting candy, etc.<br>  <br>  just dont do anything stupid, and girls, don't dress up like whores.|`|4b8bdbb75019cf2a83ebf3a855d325dbaa	you aren't worshiping anything at halloween. so yes.|`|44ab537503b323dcb61fd2a3b8221f88aa	its fine<br>  <br>  question: why are you asking this in FEBRUARY?|`|4vLEtbRDaa	Yes, I think so. God'll know it's only fun :)|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	wwjd|`|tRcO5uyiaa	I have not come across any Biblical scripture regarding Halloween. I personally do not partake in Halloween (because of my own personal belief) however, celebrations are encouraged in the Bible. In Psalms and Nehemiah and Deuteronomy, those books indicate that celebrations (joy, fun, food and feasting) are important parts of life, as they lift our spirits and help us see the beauty and meaning in it.|`|X1y5fbohaa	yes|`|TWm5Smlaaa	Some do, some don't. The one's that do participate in it because it's a very commercial holiday. Candy, dressing up, it's all just lots of fun. Just b/c you participate doesn't mean your supporting any paganism and it certainly doesn't make you less of a christian.|`|8OvTtGiZaa	Well, seeing how many people have died in the name of the Christian God.  (Wars, The Inquisition, Witch Trials...) I think the real question should be "WHo is the loving and accepting God"? <br>  <br>  Maybe you should look for a religion that isn't fear based if you feel this way.  At the very least, I don't see any harm in welcoming some good souls ounce a year.|`|RYiSYJvTaa	Yes, but you should not be asking this. Why? Because you need to believe what you want to. What YOU think is right. Not what the most popular answer is going to be. How is that going to be right? You need to read the bible yourself.|`|218b808e7b15d3ab6f134c62bbbafc16aa	You are entitled to do what you want to do. Just as long as it doesn't harm other people. <br>  If you believe it is bad for you to attend such festivities then that is your will, and people don't have the right to judge you.|`|tEo7XYazaa	Yes, only cooky fanatic christians dont believe in halloween. Its all about your intentions. If you worship halloween than it would probably be against christianity but if you celebrate it for fun than its harmless.|`|aFHJC4Blaa	Yeah, its fine. God just wants you to put him first in your life. Now if your doing things on Halloween that go against what God would want you to do then that is a different story.|`|Flc8qS8paa	halloween is a also known as the day of the dead.

It's not like you're praising the Devil or anything. You just simply want to have fun. And I don't think your religion should spoil it!|`|AA10173021	Lol as long as your not Worshiping the devil lol but no to Go out and Get coustums and go out to do the candy and all that  is compleatly fine!|`|RNDvIS0zaa	I don't think it was around in the Bible...<br>  But it's okay I think. It's just a bunch of kids going around and getting candy, right?|`|yZU0cUiFaa	yes|`|mAO3JtPkaa	As a christian, I will buy pumpkins, but not carve them, I always try to steer the grandkiddy's to costumes such as angels, or a super hero. Years ago, I asked my MIL the same question, she (being devout christian) laughed, she said it really doesn't matter, she doesn't see me falling into satan worship over it! So I try to take all the scary, wicked stuff out of it, and let the grandkiddy's enjoy the fun of it.|`|r1V0P598aa	Some people do. You have to think "What Would Jesus Do"? You can celebrate on Halloween by going bowling are going out to eat. Halloween comes from "The Day of the Dead". I'm guessing that the "Day of the Dead" is not so good!|`|cAH1hoggaa	i went to a catholic school and every year they had a halloween party does that explain it haha?|`|NSgjTgOmaa	FORGET ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK, is your believe..

You could also use "That sucks" or a  really indifferent stare.<br>  The indifferent stare could convey the look of "That sucks" without sounding stupid or whatever.
GqfiRXu3aa	Sometimes people just act weird for no reason or for any reason.  There's no explanation sometimes.  The men who saw you were probably low-class rednecks and perhaps they thought you were attractive, so they yelled out of the car.  A real man with class would not do this.  Same thing applies to the girls you've seen.  They have no class.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't stop being polite, but I wouldn't acknowledge people who are behaving rudely.  If they are staring I'd ignore them (people HATE being ignored).|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I wish I had an answer for this but to be honest they're the low lifes in this world not you if they had an ounce of self respect this would'nt happen but just think to yourself you're not one of these jerks you are better then them

He only calls himself Muslim because he thinks it's disrespectful against your parents if you change, which is stupid! Coz it's not like changing where you're from!

ykYpv2FLaa	OMGG CONGRATS!! i love helping people plan parties. im a party person. lol your theme sounds nice. I would use tthe colors dark blue and light gold and silver to represent the night sky and the stars. I would also get a really nice puffy dress thats dark blue. I bet you would look amazing. Are you having any special people come- like a photo booth or anything else? You should get at least on thing. Ive been to a few sweet sixteens and many bat/bar mizphas and they all had at least one booth- many had more that one. FAVORS! chocolate is always nice. If you do that- i suggest creating your own wrappers. My cousin did that for her sweet sixteen. Use hersheys bars if you are creating your own wrappers. i would also ask your closest friends and family members their ideas. they always help. tell me how it goes!! i will get back to you with more ideas! hope i helped!!

HFhNML5saa	You are. He needs to turn his phone off|`|PdxMOlcaaa	It's rude of course, but if you notice the world around us has become so obsessed by their cell phones that manners are no longer important.  I wouldn't stop asking them to come to dinner but I would ask them to turn off their phones for 30 minutes during the meal please.  If they don't like that then they will probably not come that's their choice.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	You are right.  He should only be taking calls if the calls are work-related or an emergency.<br>  <br>  Here are some rules of etiquette regarding cell phone usage at the dinner table:<br>  <br>  1.  Remember to turn your cell phone to vibrate or the off position when you enter a restaurant or sit down at the table in someone's home. <br>  <br>  2.  Inform your dining companions upfront if you are expecting an important call that might interrupt, and apologize ahead of time. If you give your companions forewarning, it will make them feel less jilted when you opt to take a call. <br>  <br>  3.  Avoid checking your phone if it vibrates in your pocket while sitting at the table. If you must check it, do so discreetly under the table. <br>  <br>  4.  Excuse yourself and leave the table to take an emergency call. There are sometimes when you simply must take an important call when you are eating with someone else. Consider what really constitutes an emergency, however, before you step away from your companion. <br>  <br>  5.  Keep your voice down when talking in a restaurant, even if you are away from the table. If possible, go outside to talk. <br>  <br>  6. Follow your return to the table with another apology for taking the call. Even if you have forewarned your dining companions, it's good etiquette to ask forgiveness for the impropriety.<br>  <br>  <br>  Obviously taking 6 calls -- they probably were NOT all emergency calls.  His father should have told him, "Son, can you turn off your phone and join us for dinner?"|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Depends on what your son-in-law does for a living...You know, if he is on-call for something, it isn't his fault...and chances are, if its work related, he could get in trouble if he DOESN'T take it...but yeah, if its just friends calling him, its rude...|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	It's very rude for Ted to do what he does.  He's basically saying the people at the table and their conversation isn't as important any his cell phone and that you are not interesting enough to hold his attention.  Unless he's a doctor and it's a matter of life and death, he should be turning off his phone at social gatherings.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if you are going to nice places, his phone and his constant up and down is disruptive to the other guests.  He's a boor all around.

uXdx9vuBaa	I work with tons of people with attitude and its not easy.  Its very very frustrating and challenging.  I often just try to focus on my work. Its busy so luckily i can keep busy but ihave to delegate tasks to certain people that are mean or hard to deal with. If i can do the task myself, i do it to avoid confrontation like you but unfortunately 80% of the time, i cant or i would get so behind in my own work.  What i have done in the past with very difficult people is confront them alone in a private room and talk about what can be done to get along in a professional manner. Often time, i had to go to the manager b/c it didnt work. People like this do not change and cannot.  If my manager didnt end up doing anything, i would try to schedule opposite of when those people worked.  Im currently looking for another department to work in.  Its taking a while but as soon as something pops up that im interested in, im going to probably take another position.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to  you.  Its not easy and if you can try to block these people out of your life and mind great.  If you hve to work with these people every day and you know they arent going anywhere, i would probably talk to the manager about whats going on.  If this doesnt work, then i would look for another job in another department if possible.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I have a trick that works for me my Mom taught me this yrs ago & it works make them invisible just like they're not there don't even respond with a dirty look b/c then they know you're listening & they're winning no reaction from you is actually saying they're not here at all this drives them crazy keep doing whatever you're doing at the time & just do the invisible thing try it it works for me|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Kill them with kindness and avoid them as much as possible.|`|vlov9wqiaa	I think you have the answer by just ignoring them and imagining that they dont even exist.Hard I know but the best strategy|`|swQz4R2Iaa	If theyre going off on a rant, i tend to look away.

SaJ0kQOTaa	Note: I'm not bisexual myself. <br>  Well being bisexual gets harder as you get older, as society pressures you to choose gay or straight. <br>  Some people try to say bisexuality is just a transitioning phase from straight to gay, even though it is for some, it's not a fact.<br>  Others also say that bisexuals are whores, which is also not a fact. Anyone can be one. <br>  Don't hate who you are, embrace it.|`|JxowGsKYaa	nothing wrong with being bi-sexual but ive noticed a lot of teenagers are saying that there bi-sexual and here is my theory...<br>  <br>  they are really gay and just want to make it sound less 'worse' by sayin the are bi ... obviously not everyone does this but some do<br>  <br>  teens tend to say it to be 'different' such as goths or emo's . . . most just say it to be abnormal just for either the reputation of someone who is 'far from the norm' or just looking for attention...<br>  <br>  and then there are the people who genuinly are bi sexual...<br>  <br>  thats just my own opionon and toughts though!|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I don't have a certain opinion on bisexuals. If they are attracted to boys and girls, well more power to them. I think some people have them steretyped as whores which might be the case in some, but the majority I know aren't whores. Just be happy with yourself and show the world that you are a pretty rad person.|`|ch04T8YRaa	I'm bi. I like it but it's challenging.

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Different web sites give different stats: Wikipedia notes that John Foxe's Book of Martyrs notes that 284 English Protestants were burned for heresy.  The New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia, upon acknowledging that "in less than four years 277 persons were burned to death", offers up apology, "Something  perhaps of Mary's severity, which was a contradiction to the clemency and generosity uniformly shown in the rest of her life, may be attributed to the bitterness which seems to have been concentrated into these latter years."|`|bda465ikaa	I think she had about 300 people burned to death for being Protestant. No idea how many were executed for other crimes. Execution was a fairly common punishment so it easily could have been thousands. It is unlikely that anyone would have even kept a list.

I was even able to go out with a few Japanese girls when I was there and I'm talking really HOT onez!!<br>  <br>  Not to stray off point but it depends on the country as a whole and the individuals that reside there.|`|da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	I was having this discussion with one of my Japanese co-workers not so long ago, and this is what I was told. <br>  <br>  Japanese people have a hierarchy of people.

A60fh6craa	After few days (it should be paucus not psucus), Hercules made the journey to the city of Stymphalus, he conquered Eurystheus himelf and killed the birds of Stymphalus. These birds had copper beaks, and fed on human flesh. Later, he reached the place, and saw the lake, however, in this lake, which was not far from the city, the birds lived. Yet, when he approached the ability he has been given, the lake itself was not made of water, but of mud. Then, Hercules could not advance not on foot nor by boat . (What r the **?) He used up a huge part of the day in vain, he gave up  the effort and made an offering to Minerva, and sought assistance from her. She gave him castanets made by Volcanus himself (by whom the great tools were looked after). Hercules made a piercing rackling using the castanets, and the birds flew away terrified, However, when they flew away, he thrusted a great number of arrow through them.

vvzhSb6Xaa	It varies from person to person, and usually for different reasons. Sometimes we google to find the answer to "What are the 23 flavors of Dr. Pepper?" for the sake of knowing- some people to try to make their own Dr. Pepper! Some take classes to learn a new language so they can visit a new country or even move to one- some wish to teach the language to others. People usually shoose careers to make money or simply because they enjoy the task of doing something and would like to make a living doing it.<br>  <br>  People love to know themselves, so it's fun to challenge yourself, usually, and see how you react to different bits of information. See what your first thought is, and what it is after mulling it over. Did it change and why? If it didn't, why not? Humans' minds are complex or simple- the complex people like to know for the sake of knowledge and knowing themselves better. Simple people know the general idea for the sake of knowing it- complex people do this too, and simple people can be complex.<br>  <br>  Every reason you can possibly think of is why people try to learn new things. It's boring sticking with what you know, to me. I like to know, if only for the sake of knowing or for a test. But I know some things because I came upon them on a search for deeper parts of me. Humans only use 10% of their brain power, so learning things can tap into the opinions and thoughts buried in the other 90% we are kept from.|`|RW566BSUaa	Its just Human nature methinks
MSORDfOKaa	This year Easter is on 12th April.<br>  Easter is called a moveable feast because the date of Easter changes every year. Easter Sunday can fall on any date from 22 March to 25 April.<br>  The reason for this variation in the date of Easter is based on the lunar calendar (moon) rather than our more well-known solar one. <br>  Easter always falls on the first Sunday following the full Moon (the Paschal Full Moon) after 21 March. If the Full Moon falls on a Sunday then Easter is the next Sunday.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Easter is at a different time each year.

rcdaxOzEaa	Very hard question to answer in a small text. Hard to date and place also, but i will try to help<br>  First you have to document yourself in Roman history... <br>  Latin started to be spoken in Ancient Rome , officialy founded in 509 before Christ. The Latin language was then spread through the Roman Conquest, and was instated as the official language in every newly conquered Roman province. The Latin language was divided in two branches, the Classical Latin, used in poetry , and Vulgar Latin, spoken by the common people. You have to understand that the newly conquered provinces did not lose their old language, but rather combined it with Latin, and have kept the language alive until today. Such languages are French, Spanish, Romanian, Italian etc...<br>  For example Romanian language is based 80% on the Latin vocabulary<br>  I hope this helps and sorry for my English<br>  <br>  @Ragazzo i said what the percentage in romanian is because is my native language... it has 15% slavic words and 5% Thracic words... and i did not say it is the purest latin language... no use for flaming|`|53DPNQhdaa	@ gabi, but italian is closest to latin vocab-wise, with about 92% similarity.<br>  <br>  italian would be closer because it is pure latin based, without any other languages interferring.  romanian has a lot of slavic vocab, so it is NOT purely latin-based.|`|IQT1BFjDaa	by the way, Rome was officially founded in 753 B.C. <br>  Latin was spoken first in Latium (Italy) then it expanded on most of Europe and Northern Africa. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the west it was mantained by the Church and the monks. During the reign of Charlemagne it was adopted as the official language of the Holy Roman Empire. By then ,anyway, the classical latin was no longer spoken and only vulgar form survived, changing through the ages in the romance languages (italian, french, portuguese, spanish, romanian, rumantsch, etc.)|`|Rc4Oq2pfaa	Latin was used in the Roman Empire, and its use continued in the school system set up by the Romans right through until the mid 1700's. There were schools in England in the mid 1500's where the boys were forbidden to speak English, they had to speak Latin, even in the playground, on pain of whipping. <br>  There still people who speak and use it now, check out schola for example <a href="http://schola.ning.com" rel="nofollow">http://schola.ning.com</a><br>  There is a complete conversational Latin course online called Latinum <a href="http://latinum.mypodcast.com" rel="nofollow">http://latinum.mypodcast.com</a>
LqwlAMJsaa	Find out who his boss is, definitely.<br>  <br>  It sickens me that most people care nothing about doing their job well or with integrity. They just do what they need to do. If someone presents them with an additional respoinsibility or task, they even PROMISE that they will do it, to get the person off their back, and then purposely do nothing. It wouldve taken almost no effort for this district office worker to report the incident to his superior. It's not even his project, unless he's the manager. All he needed to do was pass on the message and your phone number to a manager, and he didn't-- and worse, he promised you that he would. You should call back that office, demand (nicely but firmly) the name and phone number of the next highest managing office AND someone in HR. Try to get the name of tthe guy you originally spoke to and report him while you're at it. No one should allow a disabled person to be made fun of.<br>  <br>  Also, you should try talking to this kid yourself. Some people have very little compassion, but maybe if you explain the effects of his meanness (ie, the shame or discomfort he's caused your sister) then he'll understand what he's done. If not, then the threat of losing his job will at least get him to keep his cruel remarks to himself.<br>  <br>  Finally, try contacting the ADA (Americans with Disabilities). This advocacy group exists to defend the rights and wellbeing of disabled Americans. Their national status affords them a forefront in politics and the media. Your case is exactly the kind of case that they would get behind. You should be sure to tell them that you contacted district management (this was the right thing to do) and management did NOTHING. Discrimination against disabled persons is ILLEGAL; this store could actually be held legally liable for their (continued) mistreatment of your sister-- even if it's only one employee doing the harassment. They have a responsibility to correct or remove him, and they chose to ignore the situation. Go to the ADA to make sure that this doesn't happen to your sister-- or to someone else-- ever again.<br>  <br>  And one last thing-- you should talk to your sister. If she's conscious of this mockery, it's no use to ignore it. You might as well tell her that no one deserves to be mocked and that that person is a cruel and primitive person. Let her know that if she still feels bad, she can talk to you about it-- and work with her to create strategies for dealing with bullies in the future. If she's bold enough, she could even consider confronting him (calmly). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KWhKwgsSaa	If you prefer to not run away from this problem, then you must approach it directly.  First person to discuss this problem with is the young man ... second person will be the manager.  If you are not satisfied with results from this approach, then contact the district office -- but next time (if necessary) provide the dates you contacted each person, with a full name of the person you contacted, about the problem.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	First you have to find out what his name is, that's number one. Then you go to CORPORATE, NOT district, they are worthless. Whenever you have a situation you need to go right to the top and don't bother with anything less because it will never be addressed. Next you need to go to the store mgr and tell him about it and tell him you have already contacted corporate and he needs to ensure this kid is kept under control or fired. Your other option is to go to your local newspaper and TV station and tell them about it and report the store to the ADA.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I would tell the kid myself  I would tell him how cruel he is  & that your sister is a human being with feelings let him know that this is a 1 time warning  & if he doesn't take this seriously I'd let him know it's not going to be the end of it that you'll proceed further abt the matter|`|O4jGlC2caa	You should have went to the store manager and pointed out the boy to the store manager.  You also should complain to the district manager again.  If it continues, contact your local media about the issue.  That'll light a fire under their butt.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	I wouldn't go higher, I'd go lower. Find out who the store manager is, because he's the one responsible for hiring, firing, and reprimanding his employees.|`|ezB8eDbpaa	I would speak to the manager or the person in charge of staff, in person.  It is never o.k. to behave that way towards another person, never.  Do not run away from this problem, be persistent and insist that this person be disciplined. Good luck!|`|3120pXzcaa	ask the manager of the grocery store to have a word with this kid as this is discrimination. I mean it's for the kids own good. what if he makes fun of a homicidal maniac?|`|Y2UkhZg3aa	I wonder if the kid you are talking about might be mentally challenged? Watch and see if he laughs at everyone.  I've been to several grocery stores that employ mentally challenged teens and adults to gather carts and bag groceries.|`|914lxjtJaa	I think you are going to high up in the ranks. If you spoke with a district manager then he would have had to pass the word along to the store manager who would then have to speak to the kid about it. Since you don't know his name go to the store manager and explain the problem to him/her and be sure to include what day it happened so the store manager can whip out the schedule and find out directly who the kid is. If this doesn't work try speaking with the kid directly.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Why don't you speak to the person to his face and say something like:<br>  What the f... are you laughing at? If he or she gives you a disrespectful answer than go and complain!<br>  <br>  I think it is cowardly to rattle to his or her boss instead of talking to the person bothering you directly.  Maybe he is not laughing at her. I really can't understand people who avoid confrontation. Stop being such a coward!

'land', 'lond', "ground", "soil," also "definite portion of the earth's surface, home region of a person or a people, territory marked by political boundaries," from P.Gmc. *landom (cf. O.N., O.Fris. Du., Ger., Goth. 'land'), from PIE *lendh- "land", "heath"<br>  <br>  earth : O.E. eoree "ground, soil, dry land," also used (along with middangeard) for "the (material) world" (as opposed to the heavens or the underworld), from P.Gmc. *ertho <br>  <br>  <br>  aquatic : 1490, from M.Fr., from O.Fr. aquatique, from L. aquaticus "watery," from aqua "water", from PIE *akwa- "water"<br>  <br>  water : O.E. w?ter, from P.Gmc. *watar (cf.

qdlmy4l8aa	Eye contact. Don't spend your time staring at one person, rather, GLANCE around the room. It gives people a sense of being involved in the speech, without the hostility of being talked AT. <br>  <br>  Speak s l o w l y, clearly, and LOUDLY. Nothing says "nervous" like rapid-fire mumbling. <br>  <br>  Be aware of your body-positioning and fidgeting. Everyone has a little tick they do when speaking in front of a lot of people, whether its incessant leg moving, finger-tapping or shifting of body weight. You won't notice it, but it's VERY distracting for the audience, and can take away from what you're trying to say.<br>  <br>  I can give you more tips if you tell me what kind of speech you're giving.

(S.Muhammad Ali Sabuni, Tafsir-al-SabuniVol.2)|`|423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	"Who, when a misfortune befalls them, say: Surely we are Allah's and to Him we shall surely return." (2:156)<br>  <br>  This is the attitude of a faithful when a misfortune befalls him or he suffers a loss. It is the summary of all that which Islam teaches. We are His. We unconditionally submit to His will. We shall return to Him. He is our destination. Whoso makes his life a true expression of this description becomes His prime favourite for His grace, blessings and guidance. The Holy Prophet who stands first and foremost in submission to Allah is the ideal model of this expression which has further been elaborated in verse 163 of Ali-Imran. <br>  <br>  It is reported that when Imam Ali ibna abi Talib (A.S) heard the news of the martyrdom of Hamza, his and the Holy Prophet's (S.A.W.W) dearest uncle, in the battle of Uhad, he said: <br>  <br>  INNA LILLAHI WA INNA ILAYHI RAJI-UN <br>  <br>  And afterwards Allah revealed these words to the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.W) in this verse.|`|c1Mq2ejmaa	yasin

Yes they do, but is it to the majority everybody thinks it is?....no it isn't.<br>  There are racist people everywhere and sometimes these people just need to be smacked a couple of times and realize they need to get a mind of their own instead of having their grandparent's minds.<br>  <br>  add:<br>  <br>  meh...i am so embarrassed that indiana had the leading klan membership at one time. but those have quickly cleared out, because indiana is one of the most accepting places. we don't have the racial, homophobic, sexist problems to the extent as other places do.<br>  <br>  lol...you can tell that indiana isn't that racist anymore, because the amount of biracial and mixed people is way off the wall, including myself.|`|pcHCLfZkaa	In Alabama, I know a lot of hicks that use the "N" word when referring to a black female or male.<br>  <br>  Racism down here is actually quite shocking.<br>  We have a lot of illegal immigrants down here -- so naturally, people will be kind of hesitant.<br>  <br>  When a few of my friends walked into a store one time we got followed around just because my friend Tiara was black, and my friend Victor is Mexican.<br>  <br>  Shame. :l|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	The south is generally more conservative than the north.|`|PSzzjf4naa	The South has come a long way .

Maybe they are just rude people and that is just their way. I can't say because I don't know anyone who is northern, so i'm not someone who could really even judge. I am from Alabama as well tho, lol, & there are a lot of racist people in the south from what i've experienced. If I have a problem with someone, i'm not going to blame it on their race so I don't consider "myself" racist. That's just me tho and I am not the type of person to judge someone based on their color or religion.|`|GEqyvwXAaa	no. the north just hides it better. if you look at where hate groups like the KKK were most active in the 1920s (heyday of the 2nd Klan) and now, the most active states were not necessarily where you'd expect. for example, Indiana led the nation in Klan membership in the 20s. Ohio was/is pretty big too. Northerners and urban people tend to have a more subtle code for expressing their racism, but it is still very much present.|`|Wwry0QIlaa	In general yes because the South is where slavery originated centuries ago.

What's unnatural is forcing yourself to be with a girl. <br>  <br>  "I mean I want to, but it's hard to make myself want to"<br>  I understand what you're saying there, but if you have to MAKE yourself want to be with her... well I just think both of you deserve something better. You deserve a relationship with a man, because that's obviously where your heart lies. She deserves somebody who can want her without making themselves want her.<br>  <br>  Message me if you need to talk or anything, and good luck :)|`|4HClQObFaa	You are absolutely not a pervert.

It is human.<br>  <br>  It is not wrong to want to hold or be held.  It is human.<br>  <br>  Like you, I don't appreciate the emphasis on sex with different people and on certain musical and clothing styles or quasi-feminine gestures that is seen in some gay subculture.<br>  <br>  But also like you, I know that my eyes are drawn to men, and I too want to hold a guy -- and that is really, honestly, okay.<br>  <br>  I am a fine person, Archie.  And so are you!<br>  <br>  I fancy that you need a conservative, traditional, wholesome, handsome young man to be a David to your Jonathan.  1 Samuel 18:1-4.  1 Samuel 20:41.  2 Samuel 1:26.  I gather you are not overly religious, but please read those passages for an example of two handsome, warrior youths who loved each other deeply.<br>  <br>  I hope you find a close male friend soon.  You do have honest needs and would be much happier if they could be met.<br>  <br>  Hugs!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Acam666 above is quite correct.  Realize, Archie, that every tenth -- or at least twentieth -- person you meet on the street feels the same way as you do.  Many are good at hiding it, but the yearning is there.  Repeat -- it is not wrong to want to be held and loved.  You are a fine young man.

If a girl uses soft colors, a little blush, lipstick, and powder gives her a brighter and more even look.  The problem with teenaged girls is (and I'm a high school teacher and mother of 3), they get so into makeup and use way too much.  I've seen so many lovely girls encrusted with makeup that only makes them look bizarre -- lip liner, eye colors, eye liner, etc.  They carry around a big bag of supplies and have to touch up all day long.  They really believe that they have to look like "somebody" out there and all this makeup will make them beautiful.

o5Tb8ZQ0aa	an escort is a highly paid "street walker" it is up to the call girl how far they are willing to go with the gentleman and how much extra she wishes to charge him. high paid escorts "date" mostly, politicians, rock stars and the like, because they are low key and know to keep quiet about these peoples private business, while the gentleman who hire them pay well, and a lot of time only wish for the company, with no sexual favors. High paid call girls get from around 350.00 out of a 500.00 call to start. and have security with them at all times just outside. If the call girl doesn't return within the paid allotment the security goes in to make sure she is ok.

0fuF2sHbaa	Read my profile, that's pretty much what I think about parenting. There are too many children in the world, and not enough homes. Having kids is just adding to the problem.<br>  <br>   When that issue has been addressed, then I believe people with enough money and time should have children.<br>  <br>  People are selfish and think "my children make ME happy", they don't think about the kids. A child born into a family with a lot of money for a comfortable life, one parent who stays home and a good education will obviously be happier than the average child. <br>  <br>  That's why only parents who can provide the best of everything a baby needs should have them. <br>  <br>  I doubt people will ever be responsible though. All they think about is making themselves happy, and will say anything to justify their stupid actions.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Not even a coherent syllogism...no citations or references...What I have heard about is the unbelievable suffering of those who have foregone children to have more money.

I don't know very many people who will openly admit to not believing in God and even those who do actually have a whole slew of superstitious beliefs.  <br>  <br>  I really don't think there are that many atheists.

I cannot imagine how anyone educated in the last three hundred years could possibly imagine this to be a serious question.  <br>  <br>  My head is spinning.  You can spell, you're talking about research, so you can't be a complete moron.  But there are certain principles which, if they were not utterly reliable, would render science impossible and thus the existence of the computer on which you have composed your question.  One of these principles is the law of conservation of matter.  Beings cannot just whisk in and out of material existence when they feel like it; but a demon capable of procreating with a human being - I cannot believe I am writing this - would of necessity possess such power.  That observation alone ought to tell you that the notion of demons in human form belongs to the realm of fantasy.  You have chosen a non-subject.  It is not "debatable".<br>  <br>  I have regular conversations about demons and other imaginary beings with some of the people I work with, but here's the twist: they're mentally ill.

abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	The word "incest" triggers child molestation, abuse or rape or defected child birth in most peoples mind. Incest is the common term that describes a sexual activity with close family member (blood relatives). <br>  <br>  In my opinion, abuse / rape / inbreeding is definitely unacceptable. Consensual adult incest is very rare. Mother or a sister is still a female and if one feels sexually excited about them, in your case it is sister, I feel it is completely natural. What is against nature is, to suppress that feeling that will lead you to stress. <br>  <br>  It is all about the chances and situation a person is put in, if I had chance to see my mother/sister nude at my teens, when my sexual feelings were raging, I will definitely be sexually excited. It is possible that one cannot take it to next level from it but if I masturbated to release, I have controlled it. I am able to accept things as it is. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, feeling of incest is natural, but if you get sister pregnant, that will lead to complications. <br>  <br>  I suggest, have fun and get over with it.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	well i am not one to judge you ,if you and sister both wanted to try it is up to you both ,you are the only ones that matter in making up your minds|`|b274bdcef529af1a95fd443e4e73d070aa	Scientifically, babies born through incest usually have severe physical and mental handicaps.<br>  <br>  Morally, it's freakin disgusting. And illegal!!|`|2KjBXjLKaa	Incest was condemned in the Torah a few thousand years BC, and its prohibition has been embodied in common law. Today's restrictions on incest are quite a few years behind the relaxation of laws against sodomy and homosexuality. Much of society is concerned about children born in incest with birth defects, so if you and your sister want kids, you should consider genetic counseling before you get her pregnant. If you continue to make love with your sister, be sure to keep it private, as the legal system is often not kind, should some prosecuter make an example out of your victimless crime.|`|LyZhJB1Baa	WTF?

UvYzQv5Saa	Abby, your son is experiencing what many young men do. The thrill of trying on something that is considered taboo. But when you come right down to it all it is is clothing. There is nothing wrong with clothes. <br>  <br>  You are right about the stealing, and he needs to be corrected there as soon as possible. One reason he would be stealing the clothes tho is that he probably feels that he can't get these things by himself or for himself. You can tho. Get him a few pairs of his very own panties. Show him that you support and love him no matter what it is he wears. <br>  <br>  He is just starting to figure out his identity and who he is. He will be confused and scared in many ways while finding himself exhilarated and excited in others. Can I recommend that you and he look at the websites: www.tri-ess.org and www.URNotAlone.com<br>  <br>  Both websites will help you and he better understand. <br>  <br>  And please, if you would like to or need to talk, i'd be happy to listen. <br>  <br>  k|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	You must point out to him that stealing is wrong and that he must stop doing it.|`|Vu726Q18aa	its just a phase nothing to worrry about when he grows up he will forget all about it besides hes going threw puberty its normal|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Here is some more information you might find useful.<br>  <br>  For the majority of men there is nothing appealing about cross-dressing.  However a smaller percentage (about 10%) say that they feel pleasure from the experience?  How is this?  Well, they are normal, healthy, heterosexual men with one little kink in their brain.  Their brains are hard-wired to release dopamine and other neurotransmitters when they feminize themselves.  These neurotransmitters are powerful chemicals.  They produce sensations of well-being, pleasure, sexual gratification and self-identity.  It affects the reward centers of their brain, so it mimics the addiction response.  They feel as if they NEED to cross-dress.  They can't stop.  They can't stop their brain from releasing neurotransmitters.  They can't stop noticing pretty feminine items.<br>  <br>  His hormones are working.  He is attracted to pretty feminine things and puberty is releasing his hormones.  Cross-dressing is an outlet for these hormones.<br>  <br>  Now the vast majority of men with this condition consider it a problem.  They would prefer to be normal.  The vast majority of compulsive cross-dressers are heterosexual, and they want to have a romantic relationship with a woman, they want to live a productive life.  They want to have a happy family.  So they place limits on their cross-dressing.  They keep it private, very private, even secret.  That's okay.  <br>  By placing limits on their cross-dressing they are taking control of their lives.  Remember there is an addictive element to cross-dressing the they have to control it, or it will take control over them.<br>  <br>  Many men limit their cross-dressing to one or two articles of clothing.  In this way their condition is better refered to as a simple fetish.  Some men find that some men's clothing can provide a satisfactory substitute.  For instance, they do make some men's boxers that are silky, or made of satin.  There are men's pajamas that are made of nylon or other silky material.  They feel like lingerie, but they are men's clothes.<br>  <br>  Cross-dressing need not be a problem when you place limits over yourself.  It becomes a more serious problem when the person feels no shame over his cross-dressing and prefers to celebrate it. For this person, the name of the game is to get as much pleasure (neurotransmitters) as possible.  He may experiment with more and more feminine clothing.  He may try to feminize himself to the point of creating a female alter-ego.  He may give himself a feminine name and insist that he needs to express his feminine side.  For this person, nothing is more important in his life than his cross-dressing.<br>  <br>  You have to control it, or it will control you.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Because a person is a transvestite it does not mean they are gay. In fact most transvestites are not gay.  Transvestism is a genetic thing. It can come and go so he may stop wanting to wear girls clothes in time but it is more likely that he will continue to wish to do that. It is one of the least harmful of sexual diversions and you cannot stop him from wanting to do it. It is probably best to tell him that it is okay with you and offer to get him some female clothes of his own to wear. He is a bit young to join groups etc but later if he continues to wish to wear female clothes you should encourage him to find some support groups such as The Beaumont Society or Rosie's.|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	Scientifically speaking, it is now common knowledge that homosexuals are cursed with the body of their biological sex but with the brain of their opposite sex.  So your son was born with a woman's brain, and a man's body.  He didn't turn gay.  He was born gay.  <br>  <br>  Although cross dressing isn't really a homosexual act.  Charlie Sheen enjoys dressing in women's clothes.  So did a famous movie director named "Ed Wood."  Also one of the Wachowski Brothers "Matrix" is a crossdresser.  All are quite active heterosexuals, but enjoy the sensual feel of women's clothing.<br>  <br>  If you want your son to stop stealing women's panties and pantyhoses then by him his own.  But maybe he enjoys smelling them to, which is a common thing for boys his age.  It's their way of getting intimate with the opposite sex.  Seems perverted but hopefully he'll grow out of it.|`|urbo9yUqaa	Ask him if he wants to talk about it.<br>  If he doesn't want to talk about it then you can't push him to talk to you.<br>  <br>  You can only force him to talk if he does something wrong.|`|JVDV6NYxaa	maybe you should call a psychiatrist<br>  but he is young and probably exploring<br>  he will find out soon enough<br>  don't make him feel incomfortable<br>  he's probably just confused<br>  or maybe he is gay but doesnt know it <br>  support him and be there for him no matter what|`|l5IjG90oaa	he's just a kid ... it's normal, honestly.

That could really make him ashamed because if he wants to wear clothing that most boys his age don't wear, he probably is confused and unsure as to why he wants to as it is. Lack of support from his family could only give him self-esteem issues.<br>  Anyways, maybe you could suggest taking him clothes shopping sometime soon and let him look at the girl clothing if he wants to. he doesn't need to deck out in pink skirts and heels, but he also doesn't need to be isolated because of what his feelings are telling him. <br>  I think it is important you let him know that you are open to the idea of him cross dressing, but keep being a parent by not letting him get away with anything he wants because of it.<br>  Understand that for a boy his age, this is a very delicate situation. And though it is not "the norm" for boys going through puberty to want to cross dress, it still does happen and I feel it is something you should embrace instead of shunning, and then it is possible that he will start to talk to you. <br>  And remember that at his age, he isn't going to want to talk to you openly about barely anything, so getting him to talk about that will take a lot, just don't force him.|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	First, a lot of kids just aren't comfortable having sexual discussions with their parents, no matter how well-intentioned on your part. I've been a teacher with kids birth-age 12. I wouldn't say it means I know anything more than anyone, but it's what I'm going on. As to the wearing womens lycra underwear...wearing women's clothing and heels is normal at about the age of 3, 4, and 5 when kids are begin to develop their gender identity. If your son is doing this now, it most likely has something to do with his own personal identity. I would say let him wear them if that's what makes him comfortable and assure him that you're available to talk about anything he wants. You should also probably try to be as open with your husband as possible and he should feel the same way. It should be about what makes your son feel comfortable, healthy, and happy. Good Luck.
2zuVrxFjaa	It's Croatian and the exact translation says: But I do not really drink! Week or more ... But not forever! I love alcohol<br>  <br>  probably means: But i don't really drink, sometimes but not a lot...i love alcohol|`|EFOP8Lxdaa	It's Croatian; it means (roughly):<br>  I do not really drink! Once a week or more... but not always! I love alcohol.

8zmWA5SAaa	You have to be intelligent enough to mess with her son. If you try to make her pick, she in the end will choose her son. As a matter of fact, is none of your business. What you have to do is talk to her and arrange something, in order to make her son work or do something. You are the only one that knows her better.<br>  <br>  Remember don't attack her son because is like attacking your partner. Just tell her how you feel and give her reasonable explanations of why you feel that way.|`|x7uRjwseaa	May be he works online?|`|aPcw0sz7aa	Is this son gay? lol Im confused as to why this is in this section.|`|aWPmvPpfaa	it sounds like they come as a package...if you can't hack it, you either have to talk to talk to her about it, or don't worry about it, or leave. beware, you have to be prepared for her response.......<br>  not that she is right, and you are wrong, but a mother will never love anyone more than her kids. don't put her in the "me or him" situation, its not fair.|`|MJ5juxzpaa	i think its time for her to put her foot down and tell her son to get a job and a life.<br>  and to at least help her out round the house<br>  23?<br>  this guy has hairs in his balls already he should grow up and stop being a slob.|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	Tell your gf to make him do something.|`|Vu726Q18aa	tell her how you feel about him and see how she feels|`|hw2Cr5Jqaa	Talk to your partner about it. <br>  My dad did with my mum.

You psych yourself out of it and build it up to be some horrific thing but people just say things like 'Omg, you wear a scarf' and stuff like that then they forget. Lol, It was hard for me, being a revert to take such a step becuase I was once a semi-devout practicing Christian and they all knew that, but it's really not that bad. What I did was I walked in, sat near everyone during regestration and I pretended to text someone on my mobile phone (I was playing snakes, LOL) but yeah, no one really cared.. 0.0<br>  <br>  Trust me it's reaaaaally not that bad! :) <br>  <br>  Masha'Allah and let us all know how your first day in Hijab goes. <br>  <br>  Salam|`|8FbJjRpwaa	Aww sis mashallah!<br>  I was in a racist non asian area then; I was in year five, and I was like to my mum (reason i dont know) one morning that I wanted to wear a scarf, she was like no, i asked my dad he was like no. I was like i want to wear a hijab, they were like no you will be bullied besides youre too young, I was like no im not. So they said after a lot of begging that fine if you wear it you will have to wear it all the time, you cant take it off and on. i was like ok!<br>  So i went to school, everyone was like whats that? why are you wearing it? I answered their questions. This went on for about two weeks, but after people started to act as if it wasnt there it went back to normal. Now im in year 10 and everyone is ok with it =) but im in a full asian area now lol <br>  Inshallah Allah will help you =)|`|6LBJgACSaa	Salam sis, Mash’Allah may Allah (swt) reward you for your efforts. I don’t blame you for being nervous as people will shift their attention on you and ask you questions, but don’t worry about that take it as an opportunity to set an example for the Islamic community. They will become used to it after, it’s no big deal many people wear hijab Alhamdulliah. Insha’Allah it will be easy for you, be proud =)|`|kkO87h0Xaa	No. Almost never as bad. You're just going to get some questions on how your look has changed, etc. (More from students than professors and lecturers), but eventually people will learn to accept your decision.<br>  <br>  MashaAllah for having the courage!|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	MASHALLAH sister. I really...wow. Congratulations. I started wearing it on my first year of uni last year and even though it would've been easier for me coz I didn't know anyone, I found it VERY difficult. But everyone's different. My uni friend started wearing it last September and she had no problems alhamdullilah, she was more than happy to wear it! <br>  <br>  I promise you, no matter how weird, and horrible it feels at first, I PROMISE it only gets easier over time. I FORCED my hijab on myself, and I had to. Because if I didn't start, I knew I never will. And the sooner you get it out the way, the sooner you get used to it. It doesn't take people long to get used to the hijab, trust me! At first, they're like "wow" or like "...oh" but eventually they forget what it's like when you DON'T have a hijab on. <br>  <br>  When I first wore hijab, what I dreaded was "OMG YOU'RE WEARING A SCARF" <--- you know, unwanted attention! And they just over reacted, which I hated. Then I felt like everyone was looking at me, then I had my dad lecturing me and complaining and telling me to take it off (which made it VERY hard for me). But I forced myself to keep wearing it coz I knew it if I took it off, it would just be as difficult to put it on later in life, so I would end up not wearing it. So don't even worry about the reaction. People WILL get over it. <br>  <br>  Remember you're wearing it for Allah (swt) not other people. And it is often hard to wear the hijab initially, because that's when the shaytan can take advantage. But now I just laugh at the Shaytan, I'm just like "what now huh? You couldn't even convince me to take it off tututut, WEAK!" lol. Don't give the Shaytan any satisfaction, do this for yourself, do this for Allah, and do this just to rub it in the Shaytan's face! lol. When you set a date, follow it! And it'll go from there.<br>  <br>  GOOD luck sister! Again, MASHALLAH!<br>  <br>  Let me know how it goes. Email me whenever... if you want.|`|l7UTyy9raa	Aw Masha'Allah =)<br>  I started wearing hijab around the same time last year, and I was also really nervous. But I walked right into school with my head held high (right in the middle of the school year!) and Alhumdulillah everything turned out perfectly. No one said anything, obviously some of the girls had questions, and some people stared but i answered them to the best of my ability, and always kept my head held high. Insha'Allah everything will turn out just fine, just be strong, and show it (even if you don't feel it).<br>  <br>  May Allah (SWT) help you in this situation especially, Ameen.<br>  <br>  =)|`|ILc1XIPraa	I was met with a little bit of surprise. Most were suprised i became muslim, not that I was wearing hijab. I have never had anyone be mean to me , only curious. When a muslimah wears hijab she's given extra angles to protect her. Just be firm in your faith and everything will be fine insha'Allah . It will become comfortable in no time. Just be you , and don't forget to be happy. Salamu Alaikom.|`|KNV7oPr3aa	salaam sis, mashallah! may allah accept your good deed's. Ive been in the same situation as you and im english.

I PLAN TO WEAR THE FULL HIJAAB TO SCHOOL TOMORROW FOR THE 1ST TIME TOO!! I wear hijaab out of school but when I'm in school, I only cover my hair. I'm nervous too.<br>  <br>  When I start to cover my hair, I got mixed reactions. Some people wooooooooh and other were like ok then. The reaction I got the most was "I didn't know you were muslim!" Email me and tell me how it goes.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hey sis! I did it. I was sooo nervous but unexpectedly I got a few compliments. Yh, there were those who were curious. I even did trampoling today in it!|`|3BB8EtdNaa	Well, I started wearing the hijab in the middle of 5th grade (in Alabama, most 5th graders are around 12 years old o.O) but I was home schooled, and never left the house. I didnt start going to public school again until 7th grade, again in full hijab and loose garments....for the most part, it was a horrible experience (immature ignorant kids) but I never doubted my own intentions, own intelligence, and own self-worth, so I managed to outsmart each kid who insulted or harassed me lol, and befriended all those with honest questions, and treated me like a human being. <br>  <br>   But that was middle school. High school is just as bad for me, but you are in college. I think you should have a lot less to worry about sweety, you are among educated adults, (or at least you should be) and they should be over the childishness and stupidity of high school and school before that. They may ask a question or two, and some may get stupid, but it shouldnt be to crazy. I think you'd get more from students than from professors.|`|IhMktVTIaa	Alright, first of all I don't wear a hijab.  I'm actually not even the same religion as you.  However, I do have a lot of friends of all different races and religions.  Some of them do wear the hijab.  In my opinion if  you are wearing it for the sake of Allah then it shouldn't matter what people think of you!  I do think the reaction you are expecting is probably not as bad as it is actually going to be.  In all truth, most of it is probably in your head.  And those that do look at you a little stangly are purely looking at you that way because they don't understand.  Maybe if people understood other people's cultures and religions we wouldn't have to ask these kind of questions!<br>  Don't worry about it!  Be who you are.... be proud of yourself, do what you feel is right.|`|oUEzQXDRaa	Alhamdulilah...salam wa alaikum sis...<br>  <br>  I converted last year and I had to put on hijab...Allah swt just told me to put it on, so i did...Everyone was surprised even me...I FELT GREAT!! I have recieved questions and I love answering them...Don't worry...just answer the questions with full honesty and trust in Allah swt!! Its not that bad...Its nice..I get more respect and love it..I thank Allah swt that I go such a jihad as the hijab. Its really great to feel respected as an individual. Dont' worry about others because you're doing it for Allah SWT.|`|gndbaRgaaa	I only wear a hijab on here .... But I can't wait to move out so I can start to wear my hijab :)<br>  It'll rock!

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.
