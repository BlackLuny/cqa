20090130204833AA2HgbG	Pets;Fish	Question about red platys.?	I love aquatic life. I have had a saltwater aquarium for some time now. They are great fish and very clean too. When I was young, I had gold fish.  I am interested in getting a freshwater tank as well as my saltwater one. I think the red platy fish is a beautiful tropical freshwater fish.  Every time I got to the pet store to eye them up, I notice they are always pooping.  My saltwater fish (damselfish and clownfish) are very discrete when they poop. I see them go once a month ( I know they go more, but I just don't see it happen) and it is never dirty in their tank.  I know they have a lot more filtration with the live rock and sand and the filter.  So my main question would be, do platy fish defecate a lot, are they dirty fish, how can I best keep this tank clean if I choose to get them and are their any invertebrate that can live with them to help keep it clean beyond the means of just a filtration system?
20090130204837AAnzf63	Pets;Fish	Pristella/X Ray Tetra or Cardinal Tetra?	I can't decide on adding a small school of pristella tetras or a small school of cardinal tetras. By small school, I mean 5 or 6.      Which will look better in my tank?      55 Gallon      - 10 Harlequin Rasboras   - 1 male Betta( he's find by the way, rarely aggressive, and even when he is, he can never catch the rasboras, so he gave up a long time ago)   - 1 male brittlenose pleco   - 1 rainbow shark      - heavily planted   - 2 caves   - many floating plants      So would 5 or 6 Pristella tetras look better in this aquarium, or 5 or 6 cardinal tetras?      Thank you.

20090130151924AAQO6jD	Pets;Dogs	Should I keep this lost dog?	I've never had a dog before, but I think I take more responsibility with my best friend's dog than she does.      This little dog has been around my house for a while, and I've been taking good care with feeding it. It does not have a collar.      I'm confused on if it has an owner or not, knowing how it keeps coming to my area.             Not to be a loser or anything, but I'm not willing to put up fliers about a lost dog, knowing how much I really want to but I just don't think it's safe giving out my address and phone number to the public.       What do I do? My parents allow me to keep the dog but I'm feeling guilty. What if it belongs to another family?      Here's a picture of the dog :     http://i43.tinypic.com/2qlww9f.jpg       it's a female , btw . o__o;
20090130151422AAfspXv	Pets;Dogs	What could this mean for my dog?	While grooming my dog today I noticed that one of his knee caps is larger than the other.  He's going to the vet tomorrow for a check up and yearly vaccinations so I plan on asking then, but just curious if anyone knew here.      I adopted him from a shelter so I don't know his past history.  As far as I can tell he runs and walks normally. He's a very active dog that loves to run and jump around all day, so I don't think his knee gives him any problems right now.

Besides the two convict cichlid pairs, there are two powder blue cichlids, two male bubble bee cichlid and one smal yellowish blue striped one that i forgot the name of.  This is the second day for the eggs and they look great.  No white ones have appeared.  I know what to feed them, probably brine shrimp or flakes but i dont know if i should move the eggs and the mom and dad, or just the eggs to the 10 gallon tank that i have which has already been setup days in advance...the eggs will most likely hatch tmr since it only takes 72 hours and this is the second day.......thnx and wish meh luck!!!!

20090130152456AA6YFBu	Pets;Dogs	What's wrong with my dog's back? (I need a Vet)?	I have a dachschund/basset mixed dog. Suddenly, about 5 days ago, he started having back problems. All this week he's been unable to run and is very reluctant to jump. We feed him human food occasionally, but we don't think his weight is the problem because it started so suddenly. Also, he seems to have sudden 'bursts of strength' in which he walks faster and can jump with seemingly less pain. It seems to hurt him somewhat when we even lightly touch his lower back. We want to come to the conclusion that he pulled his back, but we're not sure at all. We're sick with worry! Please, answer, those of you who have had a similar problem or are Vetenarians! Your help is very, very appreciated!

20090130164208AARBlVR	Pets;Cats	Cat bite.. advice/input?   only if you know what to do or have been bitten before please.. ?	The day before yesterday (Wed) I got bit on my ring finger by a stray kitten (4 months old tops) at school (it was stuck and i 'rescued' it) well, I scruffed the cat (like your supposed to do) and right when I put it down, it bit me 2 times- both bites happened in not even 4 seconds.    Well, as soon as that happened I put the cat down and I made the bites bleed, a LOT, and I soaked it in peroxide for about 10-15 mins while I got my stuff up to go to the nurse. Up at the nurse's office, I soaked my finger for like 20 more mins. It started to swell a few mins after the bite and the swelling's gone down a LOT.    Yesterday, I went to the doctor because my finger was a little warm to the touch and the bites looked like they were starting to get infected. I'm on antibiotics 2x a day for 10 days and I also got another Tetanus shot (had one 2 years ago).    I can move my finger just about like I normally could, but it's still tender.       Any thing I could do for it like soaking it or something?      And, I'm not wanting a scab to form now because since it was starting to get infected, the scab would close in the infection..    Advice/input?       thanks

20090130171641AAUu52U	Pets;Dogs	Dog's very bad licking problem!?	he's a 12 year old black lab mix. he's never really licked like this before. he licks everything- his paws, legs, everywhere else he can reach on his body, the floor, his bed, etc.  it was so bad that for the past few days he's been keeping everyone up at night from his noisy licking, and when we got up there was a gigantic puddle in his bed and all over the floor from it. no, he didn't have an accident.      also, he hurt his back legs a few weeks ago and couldnt move for a while. when he fell, we think he hit his head, but im not sure if that has anything to do with the licking.  we took him to the vet and they said that his legs were hurt and that he might have a headache from the fall.  but like i said, this was a few weeks ago.       we thought the licking started because he was bored, so we got him a squeaky toy and bone. he wont touch either of them. now's he's up walking, but still a little wobbly.      why is he doing this? no matter what we do he wont stop!

20090130160937AAmApmQ	Pets;Birds	What's wrong with my bird?	i have 2 society finches, 1 boy & 1 girl.   the girl started laying eggs so we put a nest in there for her. But we had to take it out because they were afraid of it. So we took the water out of their bird bath & put nesting material in it but she still didn't lay them in there. So we put nesting material on the bottom of the cage, she likes it now. She just sits there. We want her to lay the eggs but she wont now. But if she does she goes up on the bar/ledge thing & then has them. But of course they break because they hit the bottom. But seriously, she lays so many eggs now. Like the least that she layed since this whole thing started is one in a day!   She also she breaths really fast & she has lost a couple feathers on her back.   But here is the problem:   we want her to lay the eggs but if she lays them on bottom she doesn't sit on them. She just moves over and look at it.   What can we do to make her lay them?   Aren't birds just supposed to know to do that?

We first let out the basset hound and they got along just fine; they sniffed each other and then that was it. Here is the problem, when we let out our boston terrier he literally jumped on top of her and started biting her neck. It was horrible! Is this normal? Will there be some time for him to adjust to this new dog? I just don't want my parents getting rid of him; the boston terrier is aggressive, doesn't bite people though. HELP?!
20090130170745AAG1gsY	Pets;Rodents	Guinea pigs sneezing?	I've had my two guinea pigs for about a week now. They have carefresh ULTRA (the white, more expensive kind), timothy hay, pellets, tunnel, pet bed, fleece blanket and a wooden get away. For some reason they've been sneezing, the little one more than the bigger one. They are both happy, talkative, popcorning pigs. They act 100% healthy, except for the sneezing. There is no discharge. Could they be allergic to something? Is the bedding too dusty? I thought carefresh ultra was the best of the best, or so I've heard. I'm going to the store tomorrow to stock up on couple things for them, including a new bag of bedding. Should I try another kind? Thank you!

20090130161526AAlF8pW	Pets;Dogs	My dog isn't getting any better?	We got our dog from a shelter back in july of 08.  He was close to 6months old and seemed a bit shy at first.  He is an Aussie/ possibly collie mix.  He went through puppy classes and seemed to fit in well with us.  He is a very sweet dog, but no matter how much we tried to socialize him with people, he rebelled.  Almost like strangers are triggers.  I did my research and  tried different ways to calm him.  But its almost like he dosen't hear me.  When someone walks into our house or even just passing by out front he shows his teeth, growls and barks.  A few times he has lunged toward people.  I just don't understand!  Growing up i had 3 dogs that never went to obedience school, never were "properly" socialized, and were not neutered. And they never growled or barked at people.  I am seriously at the point of giving up.  We have done so much and he has not shown ANY improvment in regards to people, in fact it seems to get worse as he is getting older.     Anytime my kids friends come over we have to put the dog in the garage.  And when they leave my dog runs around the house franticly sniffing every square inch of the place.   Is it possible that he is just wired this way?  Is it possible for him to change and if so how do i do it without putting people in harms way?   We tried the treat thing where the "stranger" puts a treat in her hand,  but my dog shows too much aggression and wouldn't take it.  What is wrong with my dog!

For my 1 big mystery snail and 100+ baby mystery snails their diet regime is this:   2 pieces of lettuce   2 pieces of spinach      I feed that about once a week, microwaved in water for 30 seconds and cooled and put in the water under a rock on a fork. They also get Cucumber/Zucchini and Tomato every once in a while.       Is that a good enough diet regime? Do they need anything else other than what I use to keep my Tetras healthy + (aquarium salt, aquarium chemicals, water changes)       Basically, they have the same diet regime as my goldfish but my goldfish get flakes as well.       Any suggestions?

20090130190924AAi9c0j	Pets;Dogs	Little help with leashing and walking my dog?	my dog has been on MANY walks, he's a little over 1 year about about 55LBS. anyway he has a anti pull harness because without it he pulls like a horse...all was good with the harness! then the idiots a few homes down got a dog, and they let it run free a little maybe 15 pound jackrabbit/dog..we've walked past it and it stands there and barks at dakoda (my dog) then gets closer and follows us...so dakoda wants to chase it!..i've yelled at the owners a few times and they don't care.   so now every time when i take my dog on a walk he pulls really hard to get down there, he only does it on our street, never on a walk in the woods so what can i do to calm him down and not make him think of that dog, the last 10 times we've walked he hasn't even been there. we live on a 1 way dead end street in the middle of no where, no parks around...and im NOT walking him on the main road...we'll both die.      and, when i go to put the harness and leash on him, he turns into a mad man! runs around throwing him self into the door, jumping on people...just going crazy. how can i calm him down while leashing him and walking him?         other then that, he couldn't be better! he's a great dog. when he eats i can stick my face down in his bowl (done it!) and  just the best 55LB lap dog you could get. those are the only 2 problems he has. for being a puppy i think thats pretty good.

20090130190453AAha5ST	Pets;Fish	My plan for a 75 gallon South American bio type aquarium. Please take a look. Suggestions? ?	Well, after a lot of thought, I finally have decided to get discus. Well here is my plan:   For the fish:   Well the main attraction,    6 discus    30 neon tetras   7 serpae tetras   5 marbled hatchetfish   2 bolivian ram cichlids   8 panda cories   10 oto catfish   What do you think? Keep in mind that the temperature will be 82 degrees, pH is 7.0, no nitrate, hardness at 3, and .25 ppm of ammonia. I have been practicing these parameters in my 30 gallon planted tank for 3 months so I know the commitment. I will be doing regular water changes once or twice per week. 25% each change and 50% every three weeks.    Now onto the equipment:   I am going to have dual compact flourescent bulbs (totaling 2 watts per gallon). As I said before, the temp will stay at 82 degrees with one heater. Then I will have one canister filter and one whisper 30 filter.    Any good plants from SA that will live in 82F?   The food is all taken care of with a big variety.   Thanks!

20090130202236AA1ApbV	Pets;Horses	What's your opinion on blue eyes?	I'm just curious to see how many people like them.    I love them, but only when there's no white around them. Actually... sometimes I like them with white around them, but only if they have eyeliner, like this one's right eye: http://www.flickr.com/photos/caseh/28703...    I think you either love them or you hate them. My mare is black with two blue eyes and has no white around them (http://www.flickr.com/photos/cloudsmysti...    Some people tell me they love them, some people tell me they're creepy, and some people ask me if she's blind, haha.    So what do you think?

20090130210542AADaqQt	Pets;Horses	Horse Cruelty....bad situation?	There someone who lives down the street from my horse and for over a year they have had 3 donkeys, and 3 horses.  One of the horses is a mare and had a foal this past summer.  I always noticed how skinny she was and this past winter is has lost even more weight.        The foal is still alive, its hard to find them in the pasture which is more so a junkyard with dumped cars and weeds and a horrible barn that looks like it will collapse.  I am going to report them soon, but I'm worried they might think I did it and do something to my horse and my friends (they board at the same place).  They seriously live only few hundred yards from our barn.  One time they had the donkey's tied up with out water because it kept going through the fence (which has fallen in several places).      Should I take pictures of it, not sure how obvious that will be?  I just feel so bad for those horses.  Any support would really help me.

20090130202758AAbaiAb	Pets;Dogs	Another Dog Food Question?	I panned to switch my dog from Beneful to Canidae, after learning what I was feeding him was crap.  But the nearest store that sells Canidae is about three hours from where we live.  I was in a pinch, and had to buy something.  I compared ingredients, and chose IAMS for large breed(he's a Rottie).  It was the only one that didn't have corn as the main ingredient.   He loved it.  Is IAMS a fairly decent dog food?  I want to feed my fur-son the best food I can, and it seems to be the best quality I can find locally.

My friend said that it is illegal because most people couldn't afford that, and vet offices are not supposed to charge excessive amounts to have them fixed.      I got the same procedure done in a different state for 50 per cat.      Could I report the vet? They did charge me 400 to have both my cats dewormed.

20090130193303AA5F1qc	Pets;Dogs	A few dog & puppy behavior questions?	*Sorry this is so long!*      So i have a 10 yr old yellow lab/american eskimo mix, Precious. Then there's Sasha, she's about 8 or 9 months old & a pitbull. She's almost as big as Precious but she's always the one who gets hurt in a fight. She's a big baby =]      Sasha likes to dunk her head in her water bucket, and a couple min after she does this, Precious will go over to her and lick her face and neck, where she's wet. Sasha puts her ears down low and looks very submissive while Precious does this, but she sits there and lets her do it. Whenever Sasha gets wet Precious will lick her wherever she is wet (no, she's not thirsty). And sometimes she will lick Sasha for the hell of it. She licks her multiple times a day, yet she is often irritated by her hyper behavior. Does she feel motherly towards her or something? She doesn't growl or anything while doing this.      Sasha often leans on my legs. It doesn't matter if i'm giving attention to my other dogs or not, she'll lean the side of her body on my legs. She tends to do it while she chews on a toy, she'll just stand there and lean on me. i've been told that it means she thinks she owns me, wants protection, or is being dominant. Which is it? She's definitely not the dominant dog in the pack.      Last one: i was told  by my grandmother that with bog dogs you have to stare them down to "tame them. She told me a former coworker of hers stared at her Rottweiler for 5 HOURS straight when it initiated staring with her. Apparently if you "win" this staredown, the dog will know that you are boss permanently. And if you "lose" the opposite happens. i've read online that a dog will become vicious and attack you if you stare at it since you're "challenging" it. But i'm not too sure about that one. My old Rottweiler never challenged me to a staredown and she became out of control. Sasha is a handful and still has growing to do, so is this something i need to initiate and/or worry about in the near futute?

20090130195555AAjNKSv	Pets;Rodents	Pregnant Guinea Pig, about 1.5 years?	OK, so I adopted two guinea pigs from a woman who lives close by.  She got them from a pet store about a month ago.  She was told, by the idiots at the pet store, that they were around 1.5 years, and that they were brothers.  They were housed in the male cage(they were alone in the cage when she bought them).   Well, surprise, surprise!  They are females!  I have rescued many, MANY guinea pigs in the past, so I can tell that they are fully grown.  I can also almost guarentee that one is pregnant.  I can't feel any movement yet, but she has the tell-tale "hour glass" shape, and a firm tummy.   Of course, this is very similar to the shape they get after a birth too.   I'm a little worried about this, because I know nothing of her history.  I don't know if she's ever littered before.  I plan to speak to a vet Monday, but can anyone ease my mind now?    If this isn't her first litter, we'll be OK.  I've seen, and helped with, many pig births.   They are in a nice, big C&C cage, and really seem very comfortable.  Not as stressed as I thought they'd be.

20090130202708AA1AsWj	Pets;Dogs	What should we do about this?	Hello everyone. My dad, brother and I have a two year old dog who is very very lovable and playfully and just a great dog to be around. This morning when we let him back outside before we left for work, school, etc. there was another dog (just a little puppy) in the backyard. Our dog tried to chase it off but this puppy acted very stupid. We got the puppy out of our backyard and stuck in in our front yard. He crawled under my dad's truck and before my dad left for work, the puppy was back in our backyard, this time our dog decided to give up on trying to get it away. Now we are stuck with this tiny little puppy. He is so sweet and my brother and I want to keep him but our dad doesn't. So far, they seem to be getting along. And our dog is actually acting quite protective of him now. They follow each other everywhere and whenever I get up, they both follow me. This puppy was very skinny, his tail had been cut (it's just a stub) and looked underfed which made me think that he's a stray. I almost thought maybe he escaped from a neglective/abusive home but he wasn't afraid of people at all. He also (in shape and everything) looks like our dog which is so cute! They have the same faces (except this dog is all brown whileis our dog is mainly black with some brown and white) What should we do?

20090130195744AAD7o0h	Pets;Dogs	Questions about Akitas? I may be getting one? Could I handle one?	So, I am wanting an akita, they're my favorite breed of ALL time. I have done SO much research, every day I visit different sources and read books. I feel I am ready to handle one. I want one to be my best friend.      I have had 4 dogs in my life. I've had a heeler mix, a purebred german shepherd, a german shepherd/black lab mix, and a dalmation/heeler mix      So I had some experience with dogs. I also always visit my sisters Rottweiler and love him to bits, my friend's Beagle, my other sister's cocker spaniel and my friend's Border Collie. I am always handling them, quite often.      I feel I will definitely not let the akita take advantage of me. I dont let anything walk all over me, and yes I am a young girl (16), but I feel I can handle this dog, and demonstrate dominance well. This dog will be my best friend and I will be so committed to him. I am quite the loner, and I dont do a lot of extra curricular activites or have many friends, so I will constantly be with him on my free time.      I am wondering, does it sound like I can handle this dog? I think I can, but I want to hear experienced owners' opinions. I also am going to socialize him by going to training classes with him. Will he ever turn on me, like attack me? Even if socialized super well, will he turn on my family members or friends when they come to visit? I've read that they can be aggressive, but will they attack their owner for no reason?      Thank you!

I dont want any answer besides that. thank you.
