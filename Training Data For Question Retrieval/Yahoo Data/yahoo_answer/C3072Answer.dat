3ixmHSwmaa	Good prank! Wish I was there to see the look on his face. LOL<br>  You deserved it since you were just looking for trouble.|`|mirOK6Bzaa	sex before marriage and religion don't usually mix...but next time chose more wisely where you ask for condoms. But no, he didn't have a right to talk to you that way.|`|FPn8QIHwaa	Disrespect earns you disrespect.
HfsZisOdaa	I would wait until normal business hours and call them to get their opening and closing times. <br>  <br>  ~
1Mc6BOvKaa	Its possible that they were somehow suspicious and evidence needed to be taken. I used to work in a sorting office for inbound international mail and we used to have a camera nearby just in case.<br>  We used it to take photos of things that caused us problems or health and safety issues, such as badly loaded lorries, items with various substances on the outside (I've seen it all, trust me), damaged items (photo is taken as it arrives, so that we can cover ourselves).<br>  <br>  The only reason I can think for them photographing some mail is that it was somehow contaminated or suspicious in another way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't be paranoid - remember that plenty of postal workers see your mail anyway as it passes through the network.|`|qxrr69bnaa	The postmistress probably felt like they were "suspicious" letters and needed to photograph them.  This was a rare occurrence in the PO.  The mail clerks and carriers have plenty of work to do--they do not have time to take pictures of the mail.
HfsZisOdaa	I would think your best bet would be to simply call and ask. <br>  <br>  ~
BO3KBsPIaa	There are no jobs! No-one is volentarily leaving there jobs because of the recession, and if people are being sacked, no one is being employed to replace them because business is slow. <br>  <br>  Maybe you could sell a bit of weed to your friends (if you do it)? I download and sell dvd's of the latest films to my friends and neighbours (for two pounds each which makes me about eighty quid a week). I know criminal activity isnt the best thing in the world, but at least it'll give you a bit extra cash.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Try your careers service. I hope you're not studying English!|`|ZZep1W8kaa	You could work for yourself in the evening. This way you would remain completely flexible and you won't have to commit to set hours, which is the best way whilst your studying. My son managed to get a good business opportunity under his belt and believe it or not he's now doing that full time and not anything to do with his degree!<br>  <br>  Check out this website they will send you information on any jobs available in your area:<br>  <a href="http://www.intouchjobs.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.intouchjobs.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HoSnPGu3aa	There are real work at home jobs which don't require any money to join. Online jobs can be divided into two types " Easy jobs " which are easy to do and "Skilled Jobs" which require skill from the candidate side to complete the work. After Searching the Internet I found number of real jobs which don't require any money to join. Visit my blog www.free-home-jobs-site.blogspot.com where I have posted easy jobs and Skilled jobs.

naequcqlaa	A job is a job regardless of what it is!  As long as you're making money, who cares what you're doing as long as it's ligament.  You've got to remember you're dealing w/the public, & people are people w/all kinds of personalities.  You'll get the nice ones, you'll get the "not so nice ones".  IF you do get one who isn't so nice, give them big smiles, act "extra nice" to them.  It w/either make them feel bad they treated you other than "civil" OR they might have a reason they are not in good moods.  Something may have happened in their lives that wasn't so pleasant.  By treating them w/kindness, you just may be doing something good for them, something they might just need at that moment.  You just never know where some folks are "coming from", but that doesn't mean you have to stoop to their level & upset you & your day.  I always try to live my life in a "do unto others" way of thinking on a regular basis anyway, this is what makes ME happy.  Just like most things in life, we get out of it what we put into it.  So if you have a chance ot getting any job, be thankful & at least you're earning money....That's th3 main objective of a job to begin with.  Best to you...:)|`|xCifmFfkaa	No, there isn't. The reason most people hate retail though is because of the customers. Most are rude, condescending, and treat you like their personal doormat.<br>  <br>  I work retail. And the attitude I have adopted is, 'You BETTER treat me with respect, or you can count on finding whatever it was that you needed ELSEWHERE.' I have no problem kicking unnessecarily rude people to the curb.|`|kFOxlebDaa	Nope. A job is a job right?<br>  Just have to learn to keep your cool with customers!
AA10299265	If it's not freezing everything, and the door gasket is sealing up okay, then the refrigerant is probably low. This usually means a leak has occurred. If the compressor were bad, the food would be warm.<br>  <br>  edit: Freon? hasn't been used in new refrigerators since before 1990<br>  <br>  Those numbers sound about right.|`|AA11374244	Probably the compressor going out. $400-$800. NEVER buy a Maytag. My $1600 lasted 2 years.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	if it freezes then then thermostatic controls are shot.  If it does not freeze then there could be a loss of freon or weak compressor.  More likely then not it is a control out.
ceb46f7e03a764bda9096c91e46a7814aa	Try the salvation army.  Also, Bay City has a couple of them one is Stambaugh appliance and I know the other one is on Huron rd but can not remember the name of it.
6qGY4cljaa	I suggest trying a nursery, as most plants can be bought there.<br>  <br>  However, I know a thing or two about what yours asking, and I think you're probably a kid, and if you ask for THAT plant at a nursery specifically, you'd be laughed out of the place.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you can not just waltz into most shops and buy it prepared for your smoking habit.<br>  <br>  Ta ta!|`|dUeDmb7raa	any head shop<br>  <br>  "bong store" in case you can't figure it out|`|eXPBp6vZaa	planet k
AA11463588	Did you know that you can get high of sage I saw  the 11'o clock news did a report about it.The report says that people buys it a  smoke shop May I make a suggestion to you  do some research on it But if you still want to get it  check around..
o6BDapZjaa	I grew up in Texas, I've never heard of Katy Mills, Texas (and neither has Mapquest or the USPS site).  Are you talking about Katy, Texas?  If so, then I'm sure there's one in Houston; Katy, Texas is only about 25 miles west of Houston, and Houston's the 5th largest city in the country!  The link below is a list of retailers that sell Xbox; you can find most, if not all of them in Houston.
4maV4O1aaa	Sweet 18????|`|AXh7WLSJaa	Lol, I live very close to union city. Im not sure about that but I hear West New York has good ones.|`|AA11463588	Look in your telephone book and call a couple of halls and asks how much they charge . Tell the date you want have the party see is that date is open, asked how many hours can you use the hall and what you can do and cannot do?
FqFPODUmaa	<a href="http://earth911.com/" rel="nofollow">http://earth911.com/</a><br>  <br>  This website gives you locations on where to recycle ANYTHING. You can search first by item (go to metals and click "Aluminum Can") and then type in your zip code or city, state.<br>  <br>  Any aluminum drop off should give you money.|`|mwD0br5Vaa	Unless you have thousands of cans, it is not worth the trouble.  The price for recycled aluminum cans is less than 20 cents a pound (it was about 16 cents a few months ago).  And it takes 33 cans to make a pound.  Do the math--you might get about 1/2 cent per can.  But if you only have a few hundred cans and  you need to use gas to get to and from the recycling center,  you wind up losing money on the deal. <br>  <br>  I realize this is not the answer you wanted to hear, but I learned this lesson the hard way, and I hope I can help you avoid the same trap.  Good luck!!|`|AA10838250	69 hi way and merriam lane

4RjM5lElaa	The last I knew (as of a year ago) it was every person that applied - it was not left to the manager's discretion (to do so would be to invite discrimination charges against them.)

J9Tbun7naa	From what I can gather, they are not expecting Hamish to hit that far south... However, you may get the wind and higher sea levels. If I were you I would make sure any valuable possessions were at a higher level just in case. To give you an idea...here in Hamilton Island (yeah, we are "enjoying" a lovely holiday HA), they said that the sea levels will reach 2 metres above the normal level....so if you are also expecting high tide (which here was to be around 4.2 metres this morning,... so 6.2 metres all up) the sea levels could get a fair bit higher than what you are used to ... BUT we are expected to get "very destructive winds" here and just about the worst effects I think from Hamish.... given that you are further south, I don't think you'll have it as badly...but do keep an eye on the regular warnings....here's the latest<br>  <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/wrap_fwo.pl?IDQP0005.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/wrap_fwo.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  That was JUST updated a minute ago...they are updated three hourly<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT....basically, they are NOT expecting any damaging wind gusts for you in the next 24 hours but you MAY (or may not) get them within 48 hours.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd wait and see before evacuating.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT...thanks for the map... We'll get the wind etc before you and it's still not that bad here....it's windy but nothing spectacular. We were ordered to stay inside from 10pm last night. It'd still be safe outside now but they are being extra careful. So yeah....I wouldn't go rushing anywhere just yet... especially since they have said you wont get any major winds for at least 24 hours if at all. They've said we should expect it within 24 hours and that info started ummm...over 12 hours ago  think.... Stay safe!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT....keep a close eye on the updates now.... They have just said that Hamish is likely to effect south east QLD later tonight....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT (Again lol)<br>  <br>  I heard that you probably got evacuated....I hope you and your property etc are all ok :)|`|ESWqGNtiaa	just to be safe i think|`|EVCBFzDQaa	I live in Hervey Bay too & I'm not moving...they say that it'll only be a watch zone. It hasn't even rained yet.<br>  <br>  This is some of the warning on the bureu of meterology...<br>  <br>  <br>  Severe Tropical Cyclone Hamish poses a very significant threat to coastal and island communities between Bowen and Bundaberg. The cyclone is expected to maintain a south-southeast track parallel to the coast during the next 24 to 48 hours. <br>  <br>  Damaging wind gusts are expected to affect coastal and island communities between Bowen and Bundaberg during the next 24 hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  Our neighbour says that Hervey Bay has sold out of batteries ( so maybe it will be big) & my mums friend who owns a shop on the esplanade says that they are evacuating... if you live on the esplanade maybe move to higher ground...
