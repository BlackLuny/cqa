ofpmRvHpaa	The Sennheiser HD202 is a very nice set of headphones that has gotten some really good reviews on one of the better headphone review sites.  I own 2 pairs mainly to block out office noise.<br>  <br>  These are full-cup design to aid in noise blocking and run about $20.<br>  <br>  There are also ear-buds if she uses a MP3 player but I dont own these.<br>  <br>  |`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Get anything what they said above (Sony, Sennheiser). <br>  <br>  DON'T BUY BOSE!!!<br>  <br>  If you buy bose, you could've boughten those $20 Sony headphones (they sound alike I've used both!)<br>  <br>  They basically give you a "Honda Civic" for the price of a "Mercedes Benz M-Class"<br>  <br>  Honda Civic for $46,000??

I haven't played any of the others, but even so they explain a lot of it while playing so don't worry about any of that. But man this game rules. I can't stop playing it. It is definitley one of the best shooters on PS3. The graphics are awesome! There is not a better shooter out currently. I love this game. There is a lot to it that will keep you playing it till the end. Its a very long campaign so its definitley worth the money. I really hope you get this game! I know i'm glad I did and I think that if you do you will not regret buying this at all!|`|jWY0lMu8aa	Well dude, i know I going to get a million negative comments for this, but Im going to recommend you Lair. Please just try it. Renting it is fine....<br>  <br>  You see, the very first tutorial is crap, and you WILL suck at the first mission, which prompted all the negative reviews and comments. But if you go back after playing the first mission and do all the tutorials once or twice over, youll get the hang of it in no time. <br>  <br>  A site said the game was "unplayable" after the 5th level. Oh really? That should explain why I am the last one... Sure there will be a hard mission here and there, but If I can do it without having to retry a million times like in Metroid Prime bosses, anyone can do it.<br>  <br>  Thats my comment.<br>  <br>  Otherwise... Id really recommend trying Motorstorm based on youre criteria. The sequel is coming out with a month or two. Resistance is cool, but a game I love is Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2. REALLY fun. The graphics really set the mood. And it requires thinking. If youre into strategy, Civilization Revolution is a good choice. Another good, purely fun thing is Heavenly Sword. Never tried Uncharted...<br>  <br>  SOCOM and Resistance 2 will be out within a month or two.<br>  <br>   |`|BW009uRXaa	call of duty 4: modern warefare<br>  mx vs atv untamed<br>  madden 09 (if u like sports)|`|zXNriY6Caa	NHL 2009 is supposed to be brilliant, Grand Theft Auto IV, COD 4, Resistance Fall of Man and Metal Gear Solid 4 are all good shooters.

mWPNfjSHaa	If it is due to power fluctuation then possibility of it coming back up is tough.<br>  <br>  If the power indicator LED is glowing then it means connection inside is proper and may be the circuit inside is gone. You have to open to find out what has got burnt or may be take it to someone who can service it.<br>  <br>  If the LED is not glowing then either somewhere inside connection is broken or again circuit has got burnt. Open and check for broken wire connection. If u find any then make the connection and try. Otherwise take it to someone who can service.

XqfH76PMaa	You have to cut them and place them in your downloads folder inside the game.  It would be located inside your sims 2 folder. Go to my documents, ea games, sims 2, then downloads.  Paste the file in the download folder and it should show up in the game the next time you play.  If not, you may have to restart the computer for it to recognize it.  Hope I have helped!|`|EnwijPePaa	Let me give u some simple advice, don't dowload any of those packages they have on the sims2 website. I downloaded a sim once and it totally screwed my sims, like when you change clothes, it would be really slow, and sometimes the clothes don't even show.....(eventually, I deleted the package, and have never downloaded anything from that website since..)...

You collect items, such as stickers, objects and costumes, and you can use these things to build you very own levels which you could share with others.  it may look like a kids game, but its fun for everyone.  ive had lots of people play it with me, and none of them disliked it. Its a must have for all ps3 owners|`|59Rd381caa	Well, LittleBigPLanet isn't worth missing if you have the PS3. It DOES look like a kids game, but they make it sort of that way so this unique game can be played by all ages from kids to teens to adults. You start out with a story mode in random places and defeat several bosses at first. Along the way you collect parts to put in levels and stufff like that. After you beat the first three levels of the first world, you unlock the ability to create and share levels with people online.<br>  <br>  The story mode is fairly easy, but there's no doubt you'll probably be going back to find the rest of the items later on. The people are called Sackpeople, or a sackperson, or a sackboy. They may be cute, but they're also fun to customize and they made a REALLY cool feature where you can control his body and facial expressions. Shake the sixaxis controller to shake his head, then hold L3 and shake it to wiggle his hips. hold R2 and L2 and use the left and right analog sticks to move his arms. Finally, if you press up on the dpad, he will be happy, if you press down, he'll be sad, if you press right, he will be tough, and I forgot left. The more you press it, the bigger the expression will get.<br>  <br>  Customizing levels is really fun once you have a lot of parts. At some times it's frustrating but not too much and most of the time it's fun. If you go to the 'cool levels' button, you can play other people's levels from all around the world! Some people make themed levels based off of other games and tv shows and movies, but my favorite kind of level, is where people make FAST racing levels. I played this one 15 times straight. It's really a great game for people with the PS3.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to Napoleon, because he doesn't know anything more than you do because he sides with the Wii. No offense to him. But if YOU side with the Wii, check out Animal Crossing City Folk. It seems like it's for kids too but it's really awesome. If you have a 360, well have fun with NXE.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The guy right above me has a great point. Half of the fun is online, and if you don't have online, if will cut the experience right in half. It's really not as fun. I couldn't connect to the servers once and I got really bored. If you don't have online you may not want it, but I don't know.|`|pOi0wewIaa	It brings me back memories of how I used to play Mario. but this game made it more features that you could create your own level with tons of things. Share it on online to be recognize as either good or bad level designer. And you could play it with 4 other people which is cool because you use team work on stuff.<br>  <br>  Little Big Planet is good because it's something new rather than shooting games.|`|pl2SocVKaa	something new your missing the game part you just think it is a kid game but it isn't thats like saying god of war isa regular fps if the bad stuff is traken out of it the game itself s amazing|`|kXlQNegGaa	The game is always different when u play.  More and more content is added to the game everyday from people creating their own levels for others to play.|`|oGtBkw7naa	its awesome if u have online play....if not it get real boring

09644ZZSaa	Actually the answer is not that simple.<br>  <br>  The short answer is if its been in water its probably no good anymore.<br>  <br>  The long answer is this:<br>  <br>  1) If the phone was on when it got dunked, it probably fried something in the phone.<br>  <br>  2) If the phone was off and DID NOT GET TURNED BACK ON, it could take 3 days to a week to fully dry out the inside of the phone. Moisture gets trapped inside the phone and takes an extremely long time to dry. If you turn it back on and it is not completely dry, if it is not already fried, theres a chance you just fried it.<br>  <br>  3) Say the phone was off when it got dunked and you dried it out for a week and you turn it back on and it still works. The metal circuitry in the phone was exposed to water and may begin to oxidize. Depending on the length of time it was submerged, the circuitry can corrode to the point where it will stop working days or weeks down the line even if it was working previously.<br>  <br>  Usually what I recommend is this:<br>  <br>  1) Turn the phone off when theres even a small possibility it can get wet (ie, near a pool, going to the restroom, rainstorm).<br>  <br>  2) If it does get wet, remove the battery immediately.<br>  <br>  3) Leave the battery out and the back of the phone off and let the phone dry for at least 3 days, a week if possible. Make sure there are no signs of moisture before using again. Don't use a hair dryer or any other high heat source, especially on the battery. Putting it on a warm device like a tv or computer is ok.<br>  <br>  4) Always get the phone insurance. Always. The golden rule of insurance is that 90% of the time you won't need it if you get it but 90% of the time you will need it if you don't.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|VbwuuW7Oaa	ah sucks for you. my phone fell in the toilet before and i had to get a new one. =/
09644ZZSaa	Out of those three, I'd say the Voyager. As much as I love Samsung phones for functionality they're just not making them as cool as LG. The Glyde if you ever saw it in person looks like the Voyager's little brother. In my opinion the touch screen is not very large on the Voyager, even less on the Glyde. The Ocean I'm not very familiar with but I have seen it and it seems to be just OK. The company that makes it is Pantech which makes a lot of the low end phones for some of the carriers (esp prepaid) and the carrier Helio is now a part of Virgin Mobile (which is a prepaid company so I don't know how that's gonna work out, besides they have crappy coverage). I was actually torn between the Dare and Voyager and I ended up waiting because the screen on both is smaller than I would like it. I'm glad I did because I ended upgrading to the BB Storm, which may not be an option for you if you don't want to be locked into a $30 email/web plan every month. In that case I'd say Voyager.

I know metro has excellent plans with no contract, no credit check and no deposit. the $40 plan gives you [ caller id, voice mail, unlimited text and unlimited calls -both incoming and outgoing] after taxes it comes to about $48 and change.<br>  But with metro you have a calling area. when your in your metro area you talk for free. when you leave your metro area you need to put money on your separate traveling account before hand to talk. So the metro phone is best for the person who spends most of their time inside their metro area. So check out metropcs.com and check out your metro area.
1w3k29iuaa	i actually got this phone for my 16th birthday in may of this year and im pretty satisfied with it.<br>  <br>  it all depends on each person tho. i am a simple kind of person who just uses it for calls, text, and as an mp3 player. nothing more than that.<br>  <br>  i would say that the mp3 quality of the phone is alright. its pretty basic and isnt really anything like the ipod where it has more than 5 EQ settings like the w580i. i have used the camera before, and its just alright. phone quality is awesome. the volume is loud enough for another person next to you to hear, but that always can be changed by volume settings of your choice. <br>  <br>  but i do have to point out the bad things... the keys of the phone crack easily. so if youre a person who texts like 100 times a day like me, then i would recommend something else. this is because within the first 4 months of having this phone, i ended up cracking the 2-9 and * and # buttons. sad. also, there is a button on the face of the phone that connects to internet, and the keys arent always locked, and that button is easily pushed... so, your data charges can go up because of that. if you plan on getting a memory card, you HAVE to get a specific one. its called a Sony MagicGate M2. you cant get any other or else it wont work. trust me, i had to run to best buy 4 times to get it.<br>  <br>  hope this somewhat helps|`|XOdF2105aa	I have the walkman w580i and I love it. There are some good features. I personally like the Fitness feature. I got an extra memory card and I have lots of music and pic. on it. The signal is good, but I think it really depends on where you live. Everyone hit dead spots one time or other. The camera is very good as well. I think You will be happy with it. Mine is pink.|`|DlOMyDaqaa	sure its ah great phone it have wonderful features lots of memory to save stuff.. movies picture music all that.|`|zFhvhUyYaa	kinda long but it will help, trust me. :)<br>  <br>  no, this phone is horrible.<br>  everyone i know who has it is either breaking or already broken.<br>  <br>  -the keypad buttons split in half.<br>  -the soft keys on the left and right rip off.<br>  -and the phone just really cant be dropped...not once.<br>  <br>  personally i would go for the LG Shine.<br>  better camera, cool joystick thing, mirror screen, metal finish, LG(makes great phones), feels better in the hand.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. :D

It holds 2000 songs, the 2.1 app will come with the new ipods so you can buy games on itunes (or get the free ones hehe) and yes it can hold videos and pics on the computer, but the videos require so changing... I would suggest the new ipod nano chromatics for running though, very light compact and pretty sturdy and has everything ipod touch has besides the touch part and the games... Trust me the nano is a rock hard thing, I had a nano for jogging and forgot to take it out of my pants, went through the washer, and the thing still works!!!!|`|25pmCwfraa	I think you can, because only the nano chromatic can shuffle by shaking it. Otherwise, I suggest attaching it to to your arm. Damage is possible if in the pocket to an ipod touch, so its best to put is somewhere else.
XGmUBxjDaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Whatever you do,DO NOT get an Xbox 360.I had one last year and it only lasted me 8 months so my warranty expired just after the dvd drive broke on it and I couldn't send it in because I bought it at Zellers where it was a 30 day warranty...that's my fault.So my warranty expired and my dvd drive was dead,so I searched the internet and found a dvd drive and ordered it.I took the Xbox 360 apart (Believe me it wasn't easy) and put my new dvd drive in.So I played with my Xbox 360 for 2 more months and then I got the dreaded RROD *Red Ring Of Death* so I shut it down and started it back up and it was still the RROD.<br>  I tried that towel trick 2 different times and it never helped much if at all.So I then said that's it and trashed my 360 because my warranty was up (It only lasted 6 months when I registered my 360 on the internet).I traded in some of my cd's and my 360 games/accessories and I bought myself a 40GB PS3 and it still hasn't let me down performance wise.They also dropped the price down of the 360 and now I know why.It's unrealiable and made cheap.I wouldn't recommend getting an Xbox 360 because of this problem.Buy a PS3 there way more reliable and they won't break in a few months of using it.Sure the games are better for the 360 but to me it's a simple matter of reliability and durability over the selection of games.Go with the PS3! You'll be thankful you did! :)<br>  <br>  P.S - I made the right decision with my PS3 and bought it at Best Buy with a 2 yr warranty.I'm glad I did.|`|6992f7219b295f67cbe5b531294682baaa	Right now, both consoles are kinda even with RPG's, the 360 probably has a bit more.  If you are into that I would go for a PS3, mostly for the titles that WILL be released, such as the Final Fantasy XIII series.|`|a7e39856faa19cab08a9b58b0f4cca89aa	XBox 360 has the most games currently. Lean that way.|`|773c3b539a3fee3b03acb856671362c7aa	ps3!!! U wont regret it!!!|`|Qz7RxTfZaa	Pretty much, whatever comes out on one system is coming out on the other, and if your into online play, PS3 is the way to go 'cause it's free and offers aprox. as much as Live.  Also, Home is going to be great, I'll make sure of it.  However, the 360 has been around a lot longer and has many more games on it.  One more thing, think about the future, as a whole s---load of games are coming (I can't wait for Borderlands).  Personally, I have a PS3, but two of my friends have 360s, so whichever you choose, we can get you up to speed in no time.|`|TaQUBvZjaa	In the future, the 360 is going to be so inferior to the PS3 that people will barely acknowledge it.  Go with the PS3.|`|cdgbEHY0aa	you should get the ps3.<br>  |`|TGTO413Haa	i grew up a Sony fan myself, but i must say they're pretty close.  It comes down to controller and interface preference if money is no object.  currently 360 has more games, but thats only because it has been around longer (much like how the ps2 had way more games than the original xbox).  if money is an object, Sony, as with all play station consoles, will not charge you to browse the internet and play games online (excellent built in wifi by the way), while microsoft has the monthly fee. in addition, the playstation 3 can play blue rays, eliminating the need to get a separate blue ray player, so even though the initial cost will be more, one PS3 (even if its the more expensive version) will come out to be less than a basic version of the 360 and a separate blue ray player |`|pOi0wewIaa	PS3

AA10326440	Unfortunately they would need to have your old phone in order to transfer your contacts.  If you have not done this, which it sounds like you haven't, when you get your new phone and enter your contacts all over again go to the media/get it now feature and download the application called Back Up Assistant. You can back up all your contacts from your phone to the Verizon site so if this happens again, gets stolen or broken beyond repair you will still be able to get your contact information.  It will tell you that it cost $1.99 a month however if you set up an online account at <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.verizonwireless.com</a> you will not be charged.  If you are not the primary account holder then you will need for that person to set up an online account through <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.verizonwireless.com</a> and all lines under their account (if there are more than one line) will not be charged for this service.  I am the primary account holder for the 3 lines under my family share, I use Back Up Assistant on all 3 lines and I don't pay a dime.  It's a very nice feature to have and will save you a ton of headaches knowning your contacts are not lost.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lRlSa34Aaa	idk.. u should go to u'r local store and see if they can pull it up..<br>  or get a phone number and call|`|SdDqWDHSaa	I don't know if it's too late for this but ask your Verizon rep anyway.<br>  <br>  If you have not closed your account yet, Try the link below: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://support.vzw.com/how_to_use/backup_assistant.html" rel="nofollow">http://support.vzw.com/how_to_use/backup...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps - Sorry about your phone<br>  <br>  |`|V6gpvM5Gaa	no theyd need your old phone

nay7AO3Daa	Don't get suckered in by that promo. We have it and its not truly 3 for $99. So many hidden fees and terms. Also you get the very basic service only. Not worth it and you will be stuck with 2 year terms on ALL of your services not just the phone. If you go to try to modify or cancel one you will get hit with fees on all 3 services.|`|AA11186590	I have at&t. I recomend at&t if you like great customers. I have been with at&t for about 6 months and have never had an issue. At&t's 3G data network is super fast and reliable. With 3G you can be talking and surfing the internet at the same time. Another great thing about at&t is the roll over feature. Any minutes that are not used from the month will carry over and be added to the next month minutes. The previous poster is half right. But any wirless carrier require a 1-2 year contract. Verizon,At&t,Sprint,Nextel, Tmobile require at least a 1 year contract.

1fRj5V6Aaa	You can't. There is no way to downgrade from 3.30 to 1.50.<br>  <br>  You can only do that with 3.03 and below.|`|DrMoFhpmaa	You can't because with every firmware update sony take more and more precautions to stop modding/hombrew because its cost them money when people use pirated games and/or software. So as of the moment you cannot downgrade from 3.30 firmware. Im sorry.|`|FWIoZH2Gaa	Can't downgrade software update versions on any Sony hardware.  Its irreversible.
R4q5xdMGaa	Dont feel too bad, I did the same thing the day I got my PSP.  I think I was trying to play GTA: LCS and it told me that I had to update my PSP to play.  So I did, not knowing I was going to have to wait several months to be able to play homebrew games and what not.  I went from 2.81 to 3.11.  So I patiently wait for the 3.11 to 1.5 downgrader.|`|dKq7DZkbaa	im not 100% sure but i would think that you can't downdrade it. for most things like computers and most game systems, after you upgrade the system does not allow you to downgrade. but if you still have the book to it theres a 1-800 number to call, and im sure they can walk you through it, if it's possible.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	You can't.  There is no way to downgrade from 3.30 to 1.50.

Dude, you screwed up.<br>  <br>  For the time being... DO NOT UPGRADE YOUR PSP FURTHER!!<br>  <br>  It took about 6 months for the 3.03 downgrader to be released, covering versions 2.81 - 3.03.<br>  <br>  I do not believe that you were shipped a PSP with higher than 3.03, so it's your own fault for upgrading.<br>  <br>  Time to play the waiting game friend.

A86WX8Txaa	You won't regret it, it's one of the best mp3 players with video on the market. It is too often underestimated in my opinion. The picture quality is superb and it plays all the video files I load on it.<br>  <br>  About the Kroo case, I have one and it's of cheap quality.  I also have this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pdaden.com/shop/catalog/product_17554_Leather_Case_for_Creative_Zen_Vision_M_cat_482.html" rel="nofollow">http://pdaden.com/shop/catalog/product_1...</a><br>  <br>  A bit tight at first, so I've stretched it with a pack of cards and the quality exceeds the Kroo's.  I reckon it's more expensive though.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't see how the iPod Nano compares to the Zen Vision M.  One is a 4Gb flash player and the other is equipped with a 30GB Hard-drive.

While the Xbox 360 and PS3 are nothing but updated Xboxes and PS2s, the Wii is the only console we've seen attempt to change anything about gaming for the past three or so generations.  Sure it's nothing HUGE, motion sensor technology has been around for years, but at least it's SOMETHING to tear us away from the norm of "press the x button to throw the ball."  And with the Wii's price tag undercutting the PS3 by more than 50% and the Xbox 360 by a significant amount also, I'll take change for $250 over same old same old for $600 any day.|`|0415a728f94013d2652049fd548e46ddaa	Well it is in fact just an updated GameCube, yet the ps3 and 360 are just updates of their respective system. Yet the Wii has the new controller... Don't know about everybody else but I get tired sometimes of the "press X to swing tennis racket" to play a game. With the Wii though you actually use the controller in the game as a source of the actual play, instead of just a source of mashing buttons.|`|2eb0a2edddb3053663086c82fbcde256aa	Yes,its the best system you shold get it.It has a lot more features.|`|6992f7219b295f67cbe5b531294682baaa	the only neat thing is the controller .    nintendo just doesn't seem to be keeping up with microsoft and sony, except in the handheld department.|`|AA10421667	Hm... have you really looked into the console?

add70a73b58746876b816cc1f51460f2aa	I was once a 12 year old boy.  And if I played with PS2, I'd want a PS3.  I wouldn't even think about a Wii, 360, or other console- unless of course I could have them all.  Maybe I'm biased, but the playstation consoles seem to be the most popular, have the most games- and generally kick more butt.  But, of course there's no accounting for taste.  Your real problem will be finding a PS3.  Good luck, you'll need it.|`|AA10421667	I'm with you, i've been with the ps2 for years but the WII is simply amazing! I'll be in line at 4am waiting for it! I can't wait. besides, buying the ps3 would just be telling sony that they can charge what they want and still make money... I really am against sony ever since i heard about the price of the ps3.
dd5d2e41c58d465bac10dd42be63d962aa	PS3, no doubt. I can't wait for it to be released in Europe...
e4a31d4c4519b8c8103c7f3479785e51aa	It def. will not be impossible... It is much easier to get than the PS3... on average each store is getting about 20 or more... good luck! I'd say line up 24hrs before hand... I was going to line up about 38hours before but recently got a phone call about a previous pre-order I made... but liek i said probably about 24hrs depending on where you live. If you live in a small town possibly 6-12... Good Luck!!!! Have fun while waiting too. haha|`|f938c53ab43ebe6e62315f474ec65c56aa	i suggest that you camp out or get 20 back up stores cuz this is gonna be a genus world record line.|`|AA10626202	Its not impossible! It will be kind of difficult. Well 24 hrs isnt enough!<br>  Go at 30 hours! <br>  I would probably go at 6:00AM on November 18<br>  Heres a guide. If u decide to go!<br>  <br>  Hello...<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent guide to camping out!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  sfwinelap_500x375.jpg OK, so even though I told you that there were lots of alternative ways to get your PlayStation 3 or Nintendo Wii, some folks just can’t stand to be away from the action. After all, launch days are kinda like the Olympics — they only come around once every four years (or maybe more in the case of gaming). And if you’ve ever been a part a system launch, you know the magic. Fifty or sixty hardcore gamers standing outside a store talking ‘geek’ about what games they pre-ordered or what information they’ve heard about the system so far. Anytime you group people together with a similar passion of any kind, it’s a recipe for fun.<br>  <br>  But as much fun as launch days bring, they can also bring about the worst in folks. I pray that everyone will be safe and that they’ll make this an experience to remember for good reasons. And with that said, this list was inspired. This is a download of my experience of over twenty-plus years of gaming and having been a part of six console launch days. No, I’ve never had to stand on line without knowing that my system was reserved. But I’ve spoken to enough people and accumulated enough knowledge to share. And with that said, here’s my list of guidelines to insure that your camp-out in front of Best Buy, Target, Circuit City or Toys R Us is safe and not in vain.<br>  <br>  1. Bring friends. (The more, the better). It might be difficult to find folks who are this hardcore about gaming — so much so that they’ll take a day off of work and camp out in front of a store in November. But if you’re going to do it, this is the kind of thing that is best done among three or four committed friends. (Basically folks who won’t leave when it starts to get cold or who won’t back out at the last minute.) Why? Well, for starters, you’ll need someone to hold your place in line while you go to the bathroom (or there are alternatives….. calm down, I’m kidding.) But seriously, there are more than a few reasons why having three other gamers with you is a good idea. You’ll definitely want the security as you’re coming out of a store with a shiny new PlayStation box in a big yellow and blue see-through Best Buy bag. (And there are a bunch of other reasons to bring friends that I’ll mention later.) But just trust me on this one. You’ll want to huddle up your crew for this quest. Round up your posse and have them start planning around the date now.<br>  <br>  2. Get to know the store manager. Now. - There’s nothing worse (and I mean nothing) than taking all of this time to camp out overnight, only to find out that the store isn’t getting any units. Or perhaps that they have only four (after all of the in-store corruption and holding systems for family members happens.) Your first job is to seek out the store manager. (Things like this are best done in person — not over the phone.) Go during your lunch hour or after work. Don’t be shy. Tell the attendant that you have an important question and that you need to speak to the store manager. I find it’s best to dress respectably (business casual is fine) and have a pen and notebook in front of you when you speak. And keep asking for folks until you get the top girl/guy whose answers satisfy you. You’ll want to know a few things:<br>  <br>  a. Are there any promotions that you’ll be running for the PlayStation 3/Nintendo Wii launch day(s)?<br>  <br>  b. Do you have any expectation of how many systems will be in your store on launch day? (Or if you’ll have any at all?)<br>  <br>  c. Do you know if anyone has already expressed a desire to wait outside the store for a system?<br>  <br>  d. Where is the best place to line up? (Nothing’s more embarrassing than waiting for days outside of a Best Buy to find out that the line is at another entrance. And yes, I’ve heard about this happening.)<br>  <br>  e. “…and what is your name, sir/ma’am?” (This one is very important. If the manager senses that there’s a chance that their false information could result in affecting their job, they’ll take this opportunity to clarify anything they aren’t sure of. (Especially in light of all of the negative press Best Buy received last year during the Xbox 360 launch.) Once I even had a store manger take my information after I asked him a few questions about another tech product. But this was only after I made direct eye contact and asked him for his name.<br>  <br>  If nothing else, this let’s the manager know what to expect on launch day. When he/she sees your face now, they’ll more than likely remember the discussion in November. This can only help you. Perhaps the manager will ask you for your name and have someone call you as more information is made available? Also, amidst a launch day crowd and lots of confusion, it could warrant you a bit of favor if that manager sees and recognizes you.<br>  <br>  More importantly, talking to the manager lets you know what to expect from the store. If the guy looks like he doesn’t have a clue about “one of those new PlayStation-thingees”, then perhaps you’re shopping at the wrong store. (More on that later.) But your discussion with the store manager doesn’t stop there because when you get to the launch line in November — even if you’re not the first one to arrive — you’ll want to….<br>  <br>  3. …talk to the store manager and let him/her know that you are standing in line! This is not such as big a deal if there are already folks on line, but I’ve heard about situations where people started lining up outside of an electronics chain on the left and somehow folks began to start lining up on the opposite side. The lines each slowly grew and nobody asked any questions until more and more people began to show up and confusion ensued from there. Avoid this altogether. If you’re first in line, just walk inside (and while you’re there, familarize yourself with where the bathroom is) and then ask for the manager. Let him/her know that you’ll be standing outside and for which system you’ll be waiting for. (Hopefully he/she recognizes your face if you followed my number 2 and the conversation will be brief.) Also, there might be some sort of bracelet or ticket that they’ll have to hand out. It’s a small but important step if you expect to play Resistance: Fall of Man on the weekend of November 17.<br>  <br>  4. The early bird gets the worm. The PlayStation launch is on a Friday this year (November 17). If I were crazy enough to camp-out, I’d probably think about taking a few days off and starting to camp out no later than early Thursday morning (…or possibly as early as Wednesday….or maybe even earlier depending on how many hardcore folks there are in your town. (HEY! I see those juding eyes through the screen. Don’t get all judgemental on me. Folks lined up for a year in advance of the Star Wars prequels….and those were shite AND they didn’t get anything to take home for the experience.)<br>  <br>  Anyhow, this is where having ‘talked to your store manager’ comes in handy. If you were friendly enough, more than likely he/she will have clued you in if anyone else has mentioned when they plan to start lining up.<br>  <br>  If you’re insanely hardcore, you might even want to start a “watch” around the store… As you or your buddies pass by the store on your normal route in the days leading up to the launch, give them a shout out via mobile phone if you happen to see anyone lining up. And bring your stuff with you. If you see folks starting to form the line, perhaps you’d want to consider parking the car and hopping on the line yourself.65697919_7ad049a868.j...<br>  <br>  5. Be Social. If you’re going to have to stand among a bunch of strangers in a competitive situation, ease the tension by talking to folks. And I’m not talking about just the folks that you bring to the launch. If you bring buddies, each of you should start talking to other folks in the line. (This is usually a problem for me. I just like to zone out sometimes and read or….what else…game.) But it’s definitely to your advantage to talk to people. First off, talking can usually uncover information. “My cousin is inside working tonight and he said that they have only 12 PS3s”. Or perhaps one of you will get some other details that you can bring back to the group. Hey, you might make a new friend (that you’ll put on that mysterious online friends list that Sony has yet to discuss.) It just helps to ease the atmosphere. I still remember some of the folks that I met during the PS2 and the Dreamcast launch. But if you can’t be convinced to be nice just because sometimes it’s a good thing to be nice, know that you can stay more connected to the real-time information flowing around you if you talk to folks who are there for the same reason that you are.<br>  <br>  6. When it comes to stores, discriminate. Last year a lot of folks were upset that I got a system without standing in some long line when many of them waited in the the rain — overnight — for an Xbox 360 — in vain. One female friend almost cornered me at work: “How is it fair that you can get a system, but I waited longer and didn’t get one?” And so I asked her, “Where did you wait?” Her reply? “Wal-Mart”. And therein lies the problem.<br>  <br>  Even though a store might carry PlayStation or Nintendo products, it doesn’t necessarily say anything about their commitment to gaming. For some stores, gaming is a complete afterthought. Just some section in the back of the store, next to the television displays. And this isn’t standard to any one chain. One Wal-Mart might have a great gaming section while another location’s section is horrible. This is why you want to start interviewing managers now (see number two) to find out who has a launch day plan and who didn’t even know there was going to be a new PlayStation.<br>  <br>  If you’re in the group of folks that didn’t (or can’t) find a a place to pre-order a system, you’re limited to camp out in front of stores that generally don’t run pre-order programs. This isn’t an exhaustive list, but the main stores that you’ll probably want check with (at least in the Northeastern section of the U.S.) are: Sears, Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Circuit City, Toys R Us and (God forbid) P.C. Richard’s.<br>  <br>  7. Bring a survival kit. (And get comfortable — you’re going be here for awhile.) - If you’re going to make any kind of serious sacrifice to get your new next generation system, you’ll want to bring all of the necessary essentials for survival. Those fold up plastic and fabric chairs are practically made for events like this. Also, November = winter. Dress for an outdoor trip. (Don’t forget, most of that time will be spent sitting in one place.) Bring food (including enough extras for the guy you met outside whose brother works inside Target. It could pay off.) Having some kind of makeshift pillow would be a good idea, but the plastic fold up chair is essential. After all, what good is it to get a new system yet be too stiff to sit down and enjoy it?<br>  <br>  8. Know the rules of the line. - We’ve all been to an amusement park and watched the kids who cut the line. We’re upset, but we won’t make a big fuss over it. Hey, maybe you’ll wait a little longer, but the ride’s not going anywhere. These rules are multiplied by a factor of 5000 when you’ve waited for hours….maybe days…. and someone decides to let their friend hop on line in front of them just before the Circuit City doors open.<br>  <br>  I don’t know all of the “Rules of the Queuing Line,” but someone let me peek at their guide book once. Two of the rules I do recall are as follows: If you followed number one in my list and you have a bunch of friends, it’s okay for one to step out of line to get a bite to eat for the group (be nice and ask if anyone else wants anything….ok, maybe not not everyone. Maybe just the dude behind your group.) However, only one from the group should leave and it shouldn’t be for any substantial period of time. Half an hour, tops. Same goes for bathroom visits. Basically the rule is this: for each person in that group standing in line expecting to buy a system, they should have waited with everyone else in the group. (Bonus: If you want to wait in shifts, but only because four of you are standing in line to buy one system, make a mini-announcement so that everyone can hear that you’re only buying one system. And this time around, even that might not calm folks.)<br>  <br>  The second rule I peeked at is one for all of you “solo journey” folks. You people will certainly want to follow number five on the list because when you need to go to the bathroom, you must let the person behind you (and maybe even mention it to the lady in front of you) know that you need to make a short trip to the restroom. I’m sure they’ll appreciate the same courtesy when nature calls for them, as well. But don’t mention that you’re going to the bathroom, only to return three hours later. Folks who queued up behind you will start to unsheathe swords and draw arrows from quivers if you pull stunts like this.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly folks who didn’t read this post are going to bring a bunch of friends — but not having done their homework, they won’t know which stores are expecting what. And that will lead to five friends waiting in five different store lines for systems. It’s okay if they’re only buying one system between them. But if they all expect to come home with systems and four folks slip in line at about 8AM in front of a hundred angry dads, how do you think that’s going to turn out? (If I had to guess, it would probably involve news cameras and ambulances.)<br>  <br>  I guarantee you — about 90% of all skirmishes that happen during this launch will be because of some sort of misunderstanding that falls under this area. Don’t be the guy on the news — know the rules of the line!1122sears550x377.jpg<br>  <br>  9. Be alert! - This goes hand-in-hand with, “bring friends” and “be social”. Especially if you’re not familiar with the area where you’re going to wait in, keep a heightened awareness about you. (Kinda like you do when you’re sitting at the airport gate before your flight.) Just like the lady tells you as the flight is preparing for takeoff, look around while you’re on line and plan your route back to the car once you get your system. (And please….. for the love of all that’s good and holy…. don’t take the bus home. You just spent $600 on a system. Find $10 and buy a cab ride home. Please.) Bottom line is this — the goal is to slide that PS3 into the space in your home entertainment system. Giddily smiling as you walk back to the car, happy that you’re carrying the next generation in gaming under your arm might result in you getting “got”.<br>  <br>  10. Bring a covering. - Here’s one that most folks don’t consider. Rather than walking out of Best Buy as a target with a big yellow and blue bag, why not bring something to make your $600 less conspicuous? Most people who have considered this go with the ever popular “black garbage bag”, but sometimes those can be just as conspicuous. My suggestion - get a big Macy’s shopping bag or a large shopping bag from any other clothing store. (A pink Conway bag is your road to success). Also, remember to put a few shirts inside of the bag so that you can drape them over the box. Again, it sounds silly, but the whole point of gaming is fun and you want to ensure that you get home safely so that you can enjoy your system. And that brings me to my next point…..<br>  <br>  11. If you sense danger, WAIT! - If you’re in the rare situation where you feel that you’re not safe, go back to the store. It’s the mall’s responsibility to make sure that you have a safe environment in which to shop. At Best Buy or Circuit City, talk to those annoying guys that bug the hell out of you for your receipt when you’re trying to leave the store. Tell them that you don’t feel safe and you think some security is needed outside of the store. Then hopefully the “mall cops” will deter any theft and you can go home safely. Thankfully I’m a big guy and I haven’t had to do this before. But it’s not about just you. Perhaps there’s some Mom who doesn’t see the danger that you see. Why risk the trip just because you’re in a hurry to get home and play? You’re risk losing your money and the system that you waited on for hours. If you sense danger, swallow your pride, go back to the store and make sure that there’s enough security there for everyone to get home safely.<br>  <br>  I’d rather wait inside the store — even for an hour or more until the situation is safe — than to have the system in hand, only hours from glory and rush out into danger, not only putting the system in jeopardy, but your life as well. Patience, Young Skywalker.<br>  <br>  12. If you wait in line a day or more in advance of launch, agree to sleep in shifts. - This might sound rather silly, but if get your place in line on Wednesday (November 15), discuss with your buddies a plan for sleeping. I know it sounds as if I’m overcomplicating the experience as if folks were in an episode of ‘Lost’, but whaddya want?!! I knew a guy who was so hardcore to get a system that he stayed up for the two days that he was on line (Xbox 360) and as it got closer to the 9am hour, sleep began to overtake his body. He eventually got his system, but think of the risk he was putting himself in…. (especially considering number ten on the list) walking out of a store needing desperately to rest with a $700 bag in your hand.<br>  <br>  Now, if you’re with a group, this one is easy. (Usually there’s a guy who can operate on little to no sleep.) However, if you’re alone, this will be a challenge (to say the least). But as you’re being social (see five), at least discuss it with the folks you are standing around. (My strong advice is that if these aren’t folks that you know and you need to sleep a few hours before the actual launch date, “don’t trust em!” You might wake up in a lawn chair by yourself in front of Circuit City at 11:30am with a damn PS3 bracelet still on your arm — that is, if they didn’t cut that from your wrist! And no, I didn’t hear about this actually happening, but it does sound pretty funny.)<br>  <br>  13. Enjoy yourself! - Hey, this is a game system launch — bring games! Bring a DS or a PSP and see how many folks show up on the network. Again, you might make some new friends that you can look for later on that day on the PS3’s mysterious online friend finding system. The point is, as much as this is a sacrifice, it’s a time to celebrate your passion. I mean, let’s not get too crazy….. don’t dress in cosplay or anything, but bring a portable system and a few games. (And don’t get so excited about the new system that you lose or forget your $199 PlayStation Portable. Yet another good reason to have a bunch of friends — someone can guard the knapsacks of gaming goodies.)<br>  <br>  My advice is to take a few mobile phone movies. This experience can be something you look back on and laugh about. (That is, provided you actually get a system.) But forsaking all other rules…. above all else….please…..<br>  <br>  14. Please, Please, Please — BE SAFE!! - I would love to turn on the news on the 17th at 6pm and see only corny news stories about “PlayStation Mania” where they stick a camera in front of some little kiddies who just stare and drool on the mic. But sadly, I suspect that Friday November 17 is going to be one crazy day. Remember — above all else, this console is not worth your life. If faced with the unfortunate situation of having it stolen, just walk away thanking God that you lived to talk about it. No system is worth your life or your health. It’s unfortunate that the economic situation is such that hard working folks can’t all afford to enjoy the fun, but that’s just the sad state of affairs that we live in. Best thing you can do is get a system and share the experience at home with a friend who might not have been able to afford one. But please, please….just be safe|`|50d9796c344a32084fcd3ec7c62f2794aa	No i dnt think so.....most people are going to be insterested in the Playstation 3 and im pretty sure the wii is going to be avaialble...i think it comes out 2morrow..|`|AA10421667	This question has been asked already but, try a store open 24-hours and wait to get it at midnight (i would get in line as soon as they open on saturday and have somebody bring you food all day) and if that fails immediately go to a back-up store.

1fRj5V6Aaa	That's depends on what version of firmware you have.   For 3.03, you do need an unpatched copy of GTA:LCS in order to downgrade.  If your's friends has it, you can borrow it from him.<br>  <br>  BTW, downgrading is very risky can make your PSP completely useless.
0XyyWIetaa	You are clicking on the shortcut for the program the installs itunes not the itunes shortcut so you basically are just reinstalling it. Connect your ipod and itunes should open automatically, if not click 'Start' on lower left of your pc, click 'All Programs', find 'iTunes' and click on it.

A86WX8Txaa	For a 9yr old, I think the Zen V+ is perfect. The iPod Shuffle isn't worth it because it has NO screen. Also, 4GB is more than enough for music and short videos and the player's size should fit her hand perfectly. <br>  <br>  I would have proposed the Zen Stone Plus but the screen is monochrome, doesn't play videos and is only available in 2GB. Another choice would be the Sansa e260 4GB @ $120 with a MicroSD expansion slot, however, I wouldn't recommend it to a 9yr old. <br>  <br>  The Zen V Plus is $98.99 @ amazon.com:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBNXX2/sr/ref=pd_cp_e_1/104-9762434-7857516?ie=UTF8&qid=1185215268&sr=8-4&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-41&pf_rd_r=0RYB6XYXARK5Q16JWCGH&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=250314601&pf_rd_i=B0007Y79G2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBN...</a>|`|1PeTRHUMaa	It is very good getting 4 gb for 110$, but you should copy and paste the complete model name into google and find out things like battery duration, reliability, compatability, and etc. But Zen is a good MP3 choice, and you won't find anything with 4 gb cheaper, so I'd say go for it.|`|320bdf291cbffa58c70e9f845dbcf417aa	Why don't you try getting her an iPod shuffle in her favorite color or a 1st generation iPod nano for only $99.

46c6cd758d553b0d3d46f76cff5e00ddaa	1. when downloading music, download mp3s not wma or other format. mp3s are more flexible and easier to manage compared to other digital formats<br>  <br>  2. Use usb for faster synchronization<br>  <br>  3. before connecting your device (mobile phone/ mp3 player /ipod), install all necessary software. consult user's manual supplied with the product package for further details.<br>  <br>  4. windows media player isnt that good in synchronizing data with other mobile devices. Usually, windows media player is the "last resort", meaning if your device didn't come with a software or PC suite, then you can use it. example, in my ipod i use iTunes...Nokia PC suite for my Nokia phone (music, pictures, files sync), windows MP for my sansa mp3 player because it didnt come with a software. there is a specific software for every device/gadget so that you can easily manage and organize your music and other files.<br>  <br>  5. when you successfully connected your device to your computer, you are good to go.

That's the beauty of custom firmware: ability to run homebrew under higher version of the firmware.<br>  <br>  No, recovery menu in 3.03 OE-c will not unbrick your PSP, you can only use it to fix a semi-bricked PSP.

1fRj5V6Aaa	No.  Everything start with 1.50: homebrew, emulators, or custom firmwares.  You really need unpatch GTA LCS to do the downgrade to 1.50 first.<br>  <br>  How about asking friends to do that for you.  Or search Craiglist or internet to see if anyone at your local area offer services (for fee) to do the downgrade and/or upgrade for you.<br>  <br>  Another option is return your 3.03 and buy one with custom fireware 3.03 OE-c or 3.10 OE-a (that's all you need for everything) from Ebay.

1fRj5V6Aaa	Actually, I think 3.XX OE is much better than 1.50.  This is why:<br>  <br>  1) It can run homebrews like 1.50 and most of the stuff you need already built in.  In 1.50, things like running ISO and homebrews, you need to install additional programs in order to get them running.  In OE, you just need to drop the file in the right folder and that's it.<br>  <br>  2) It has all the functionality of the 3.XX firmware.  Particularly PS1 emulator.  This means you can play PS1 games!<br>  <br>  3)  Recovery Menu:  This is very important.  If you try to customize your PSP (i.e. XMB icon, gameboot) or installing new firmware and messed up.  You can fixed it using recovery menu (provide you have a back up and the recovery folder).  You can never do that in 1.50<br>  <br>  As for downgrading from 3.10 OE-A back to 1.50, I think you can just run the 1.50 updater and it will put you back to 1.50.  No downgrader necessary.|`|6de32ba561a68b423f2e5ceba16094c6aa	Ignore akhil. He's just an anti-homebrew troll.<br>  <br>  You'll definitely want to use an OE firmware. The latest is 3.40OE-A.<br>  <br>  The advantages over 1.50 in OE firmwares are as follows:<br>  1) Use of all homebrew.<br>  2) 3.40 features built into XMB, such as the web browser, WMA playback, etc etc.<br>  3) 3.40 ISO/UMD loading without DevHook.|`|AA11203173	In my expierence 2 of them are not better i suggest 3.11. 3.10 OE-A is good and we can run homebrew application but sometimes when installing our PSP gets bricked. i you want to run homebrew applications i suggest you 3.30 OE-A it's the best.

The Ps3 is more powerful than any computer on the market. Yeah. But is it fun?  But Nintendo dropped out of the techno race and focused on one thing for the Wii. Gameplay. Fun.  I've even played games that don't have amazing graphics, but are fun to play. (star wars battlefront for example) Graphics are usually the second or third  thing I look for in a game.  After Funability, and gameplay/control.

If you already have the music on you computer all you need is Windows Explorer which everyone has.  The easy way to open Explorer is to hit the window button (between the Ctrl and Alt keys on your keyboard) and the E button at the same time.  With the sansa plugged into a USB port, it should appear as another drive letter, then you just drag and drop the music files from where your music is onto the sansa drive.  First time you plug in the sansa it will do a little song and dance as it recognizes the new hardware (if you have XP).

Then in your PSP, go to Setting > USB connection.  Your PC should be able to identify the PSP hardware and create a disk drive for you.  You can use the PSP drive just like anything disk drive to transfer files.<br>  <br>  As for transfer games, it's really depends on what kind of games your are talking about.  Some games only run on PSP that is homebrews enabled.  So even you put the game in your PSP, it may not run.
3w8jr9iBaa	The newest firmware that can still be downgraded is 3.03.  To get it to work, you'll need an unpatched copy of the GTA:Liberty City Stories UMD. The hack should get you down to v1.5, from there you could update to Dark Alex's 3.03OE-A, if you have a firmware NEWER than 3.03, you will not be able to run a downgrader as of now.   Although you can purchase a modchip like the Undiluted platinum.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Sound like you have firmware 3.10.  <br>  <br>  When you say old skool games, I guess you mean games from older generation gaming systems (i.e. Genesis, SNES, NES, etc.).  <br>  <br>  In order to play those games on PSP, your PSP need to be homebrew enabled.  This means your PSP has to be on firmware version 1.50 or install customized firmware (still need to be on 1.50 first).    If you have firmware above 1.50, you need to downgrade it to 1.50.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, for firmware 3.10 and above, there is no downgrade available.
f020e3a0e5262691d00cabf49047b3b6aa	Well, depending on the sentence it's used in, ISO could mean a couple of things, but typically when talking about games, people are simply refering a specific format of a CD/DVD image (the single big file that defines all the data of the CD).<br>  <br>  Eboot is basically the emulation startup protocols that the PSP will need to run in order to understand what the flop the CD is trying to tell you.  The basic assumption here of course being that you are trying to use your PSP as an emulator for PC or other platform games.<br>  <br>  Be careful doing this though, while I don't believe it will cause any damage to your PSP, I think using it to emulate other platforms technically nullifies your warrenty.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	ISOs are Game Disk Image.  In order to run those game, you need a Loader program to run it.<br>  <br>  Eboots are PSP programs you can run without any additional software.  (Think of it as exe in PC world).|`|cOhx0lICaa	I could be leading you astray but I figure I would try. ISO as in Internation Standards Organization provides technical standards for developers, programmers, technical people. In other words they provide a guideline or a principle of how things should flow and work.<br>  EBoot or Eboot Loader or also called Eloader is a program that lets you run free, non-commercial software on PSPs with firmware version v2.0 - v2.80  (take a look at www.noobx.eu/content/eboot.html

So you are out of luck sorry.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	First  of all .rar is compressed/archived file format.  You need programs like Winrar or 7-Zip in order to extract the files.<br>  <br>  Then, in order to run the game, your PSP needs to be homebrew enabled.  This means your PSP has to be in firmware 1.50 or in custom firmware like 3.03 OE-c or 3.10 OE-a.   In any case, you need to downgrade your PSP to version 1.50 first.<br>  <br>  However, currently there is no way to downgrade version 3.11 PSP to 1.50.
9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	Yeah, you must not know how this works.... There won't be one until it gets decrypted. Has it yet? No, so stop asking.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	In order to have a downgrader, developers need to find security hole in the firmware in order to exploit it for the downgrader.  <br>  <br>  Version 3.11 has been decrypted.  However, they yet to find the security hole that is necessary for making downgrade possible.  So we have to wait.
sL5lnAMBaa	Doing this would require a breaking of the digital millenium copywrite act because you would have to break the copy protection on the disc if it was a commercial disc. I will assume that you are ripping privately made discs. Ripping just means copying a disc to your computer. To do this on a PC I would use auto gordian knot or dvd shrink. On a mac I would use handbrake. Google or Yahoo either of these and follow the instructions. Then use PSP Video 9 to put them on the PSP|`|RYZb8tA3aa	if u have a 5 GB memory<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  DVD rip<br>  <br>  +700 mb memory|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Yes.

First ripping your DVD using DVD Decrypter and then convert it to PSP format using PSP Video 9.<br>  <br>  PS: Average movie size is about 400 - 700 MB.   Make sure you have large enough memory card to hold it.|`|JeHpV0LOaa	the best way to do this to save space on your PSP would be to rip the movie to an MPG (MPEG) file and then convert it to whatever format the PSP uses (I think it can use 3gp which is a very good format) to convert to 3gp use mpegable which works extremely well.

There is no other program that Apple will allow the iPod to use. Try using the new iTunes 7.1.1 <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/itunes/download</a>
1fRj5V6Aaa	For music and movies, you don't need downgrading.<br>  <br>  But for playing iso games.  You need to be in version 1.50 or custom firmware like 3.03 OE-c (which also need to install from 1.50 first).<br>  <br>  The reason why people downgrade to 1.50 is because that version allows people to play homebrews.  Homebrews are programs written by people which allow the PSP to do lot of different things.  But the most noticeable are emulators and dev hook/game loader.  Emulators allows people to play games from other system (i.e. Super Nintendo, Gameboy Advances, Playstaion One, etc).  Dev. Hook and/game loader allow people to play PSP ISO games.<br>  <br>  However, downgrading 1.50 involves significant risk and can make your PSP totally useless.  Unless you know what you are doing, I don't think you should downgrade your PSP.|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	People often think it is good to downgrade to version 1.5 the reason is you can download games in iso format and save them to your memory card without purchasing a game however the isnt as simple as downloading and sending to memory card its very complicated and very overrated as you need like a 4gig mmc card to store 4 games on o and on 1.5 you cant listen to music or watch films and if it brakes and the store find out you downgraded you wont get a refund just stick to the latest if u ask me more pros than cons

tT9KnaXJaa	well, I'm not an expert on Wi-Fi either, but I do know that Wi-Fi enables you to communicate with others who own a DS. For example, in Nintendogs, the Wi-Fi connection lets you "take walks" with your dog and meet other "dog" owners. This only works within a certain range though. Basically, Wi-Fi is just a way of communicating over satellite (?, not sure).|`|LHQ5RKMGaa	I believe Wi-Fi is a wireless connection of sorts, that allows you to connect with other DS users around the world, or just in a certain range.

FDq07x8caa	well the reason y u would need a 1.50 and a 3.30 sony update is wen you have tha 3.30 oe file put those in there but rename them 150.pbp and 330.pbp (don't leave it at eboot) once you have done that transfer those without havin tha folders in there into the oeupdatemaker foleder( tha one without tha "%" on it) and once you got that knocked out the way transfer those two folders oeupdatemaker and oeupdatemaker% into your psp/game folder and start it up once your on there it'll check to see that u have 150.pbp and 330.pbp and it'll start to make it into a DXAR file once thats completed it will take you back to your main menu on your psp and once it does that re-connect your psp to the cpu and find the oeupdatemaker folder on ur psp/game folder and click on it and then you'll see DXAR.DXAR once you find that transfer that .DXAR file into the 3.30 oe firmwareisntaller but don't put it in the one wit tha "%" on it put it on the other one..once you got that knocked out of the way make sure you have ur psp battery up to 75% or higher once you have got that straighten out all u gotta do now is juss hit "X" and let it download once you got that knocked out of tha way check ur psp to see wat firmware its on and if it says that its on 3.30 oe that u did it correct if not then try it again... but remember it has to be on 75% or higher|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	The instructions is in the readme.txt file, pretty much self explanatory.<br>  <br>  The whole process involves 2 steps.  First, it generate the DATA.DXAR.  You need to use the 1.50 and 3.30 updater in order to generate the file (reason why?  Ask DAX himself).  Make sure the files are renamed 150.PBP and 330.PBP accordingly.  <br>  <br>  The second step is the flasher program that refresh the PSP system memory.  This is where your system can be bricked.  Make sure you have 75% and above charge in your system.  I will just plug it to AC just in case.
1fRj5V6Aaa	The update comes with the game you are playing.  It just wants to ensure your PSP has high enough firmware version to play the game.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.  I don't think your PSP will let you install it anyway (If they do, we will not need any downgrader to start with).
AA12182731	Just turn it on. Make sure it is charged. If that doesn't work send it Sony.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	No, Only custom (hacked) versions of PSP firmware have recovery menu.<br>  <br>  The custom versions are: 3.03 OE, 3.10 OE, 3,30 OE.

There is no way for you to install 3.40 OE because it can only be installed from 1.50 and there is no downgrader for 3.11.

klRUWJYEaa	MP3 is a compressed audio format that has become in one of the most popular and a "standard" in music industry. Curiously "MP3" stands for "Moving Picture 3" this is because of the groups of experts that created two compression formats: MPEG (video) and MP3 (audio). MP3 it's an abreviation for "Moving Picture Experts Group Layer 3 (MPEG-Layer 3)" There are many formats developed for this group like MPEG-layer 1, MPEG-layer 2, and MPEG-layer 4 (MP4). There are other audio formats like WMA, WAV, OGG, AAC, etc.|`|nay7AO3Daa	MP3 is an audio compression format. The compression removes certain sounds that cannot be heard by the listener, i.e. outside the normal human hearing range. It provides a representation of pulse-code modulation–encoded audio in much less space than straightforward methods, by using psychoacoustic models to discard components less audible to human hearing, and recording the remaining information in an efficient manner. Similar principles are used by JPEG, a lossy image compression format.
RPFaLQCTaa	You shouldn't have any problems as long as you are doing everything right.  First of all, are you trying to play the games using a game loader like dev-hook?  If so, get rid of dev-hook (you no longer need it).  Place the iso's or cso's directly into the ISO folder and you should be able to play the game directly off of the xmb (main menu).|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	What kind of games you are trying to play?  Depends on the type of games, you'll need to put into correct folder (if the folder does not exist, create it).<br>  <br>  ISO/CSO games : ISO folder <br>  Homebrews: /PSP/GAME150<br>  PS1 games: /PSP/GAME<br>  <br>  Also, lot of games you downloaded are in compressed form (like zip or rar) you'll need to extract the game out in order to play.|`|99867509e023f497f5c90c0ef439e2f7aa	what games were they? were they for version 1.50? because i think you could still play homebrew from other versions too. just google 3.03 oe-c help on google
fCl7qwD2aa	i don't think they ALL come with the latest updates. But you should be fine to update. I think it's only if you downgrade your psp might get bricked. <br>  But you will have to update sooner or later to play more games or add more accessories|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Lot of people brick while updating because their batteries do not have enought charge (you need at least 75% charge).<br>  <br>  Also, many of them do not have patient or they got scared when the screen seems to be freezed or not doing anything.  So, they pull the batteries out at the middle of updating instead of waiting for the update to be finished.<br>  <br>  So, if you don't do anyting of them, you should be OK.
Fv5xHT4Waa	Yes, you will be able to take videos. Apple has built a ton of functionality into the thing. If you have any other specific questions, the iPhone wiki has a lot of information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone</a><br>  <br>  Or if you're interested in getting an iPhone for free, check this out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://free-iphone.notlong.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free-iphone.notlong.com/</a>|`|nay7AO3Daa	Sure, but they are going to suck like most cell phone cameras because the resolution is going to be low. Also the iPhone will cost a ton and be locked to Cingular only and you can only use apple made/approved apps. Get a real smartphone like a HTC and enjoy.
6WFIXIWfaa	Okay, I am not entirely sure but...<br>  <br>  The phone should have come with a USB cable and some synchronizing software.  You should be able to put videos on it using that program.  If you cannot, try opening "My Computer".  There should be a section on it about removable storage, or the icon of your phone should appear.  You can click that icon, which should take you to a list of different sections of the phone, like Music, or Videos.  Click on Videos and drag-and-drop your videos into this section.  And if this does not work, it does not show up in "My Computer", or you do not have the software, then try Googling the software online, or try download.com, and try to download it.  If, for some reason, you do not have the USB cable, then you might be out of luck, but you can try different USB cables from other products.  When doing this, be aware that this might ruin your phone, so I am sorry if this does happen.  I wish you good luck, and I am sorry if this does not help.

Do you have the instruction book for the TV?|`|1KDdTE9Xaa	sometimes for s-video you have to go into the menu because it doesn't have an auto sense switch on the input. Go into the menu, look under inputs or options and find s-video and enable it, also make sure you haven't broken any of the connections for the s-video on your tv, simply connecting an ohm meter (which calculates resistance) does not prove that the tv is actually getting a signal.

qNvPOWymaa	Although they sound similar, mp4 couldn't really be considered a follow on or "sequel" to mp3 that adds video to audio playback.<br>  <br>  Mp3 is an audio compression format, that is, it takes digital audio files and makes them smaller by stripping off unneeded information.<br>  <br>  Mp4 is a multimedia container format used to combine digital audio, video and other data streams into a single file.<br>  <br>  Therefore an mp4 video file may consist of two mp3 audio streams in different languages, a Divx (a video compression system, think a video version of mp3) video stream and a text stream with closed captions.|`|6BxdI0vcaa	mp4s are better<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  well, mp4s have music AND VIDEO and any other extras such as radio, pictures ect.<br>  <br>  mp3s only have music but no video, sometimes mp3s can have pictures and radio ect. <br>  <br>  my mp3 player has pictures, music and radio... even though it's and MP3 not MP4 player... its still better than all of yours!!!!!

qNvPOWymaa	VGA = Video Graphics Array. It is a computer graphics standard first marketed by IBM in 1987. Basically it was developed to come up with uniform text and graphic display sizes for computers.<br>  <br>  In context of cell phone cameras, it refers to picture sizes 640x480 pixels or less in size. This is because the maximum size dictated by the VGA standard is 640x480.

A86WX8Txaa	I've been using 1800-2500mAh batteries with my flash for years and I've never had any problem. Alkaline batteries die out real quick when the 2500mAh last for days..<br>  <br>  Personally I'd use the 2500mAh, but if you're worried, use the 700mAh and keep the 2500mAh as backup.|`|AA10954511	The flash specs reference rechargables, so using them is ok:<br>  <br>  Power Source<br>  Four AA-size Alkaline Batteries (6V)<br>  Four AA-size Ni-MH (4.8V) <br>  <br>  Rechargables have a different (lower) voltage and devices must be designed to use them, which this flash is. No matter the capacity, the voltage is unchanged. Even if the capcity was 100,000 mha, it wouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  Get the most capacity you can! It won't hurt anything and you'll get a lot more pictures.|`|DOoJgaalaa	If you can use NiMH cells, it shouldn't matter what capacity they are.  The mAH rating is quite different to battery voltage, which is the critical issue for electronic components.  Every NiMH cell will have the same voltage, irrespective of its capacity, and the flash will draw the same current to run itself with either 700mAH or 2500mAH as a result.  So you can expect roughly three times the useful life with the larger capacity battery.
kZHJ8lhdaa	Well, yes, but HDMI is the port for the digital transmission cable. It has nothing to do with the resolution of the screen.|`|6a9Yvrdgaa	If a TV has HDMI in-puts on it, it means you can use an HDMI cable from the TV to the cable box( also equipped with an HDMI in-put), instead of using a component cable. These are better because they are shielded cables which eliminate any outside interferences. They carry video & audio. HDMI stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface, which means it delivers a better signal for HD and Digital, and good audio. It's good for any resolution, because it's made for HD resolutions of varying ranges.|`|1d0b8f1417c90b159cb177129e2f253eaa	Strictly speaking, no, it does not mean it has HD capabilities.  It would be possible for a company to make a TV that does only 480p (EDTV) and has HDMI in and downsamples everything to 480p.<br>  <br>  While I do not believe such a TV actually exists anywhere in the world, the fact remains that having HDMI in does not automatically mean the set is in fact HD resolution.<br>  <br>  You will want to check the resolution in the specifications of any TV you are considering purchasing.
STUsNoNTaa	I would check in the manual you might find it has certain impedance requirements or the connections could be make specific  there could be frequency issues that require you to only use their brand if after checks none of these are the case you should be able to use another compatible brand|`|bf1516da956568e74d59916a14fb1ecfaa	yes you can use other tuners with it. but why wud you but a techwood plasma , seriosly thats not a good brand|`|1d0b8f1417c90b159cb177129e2f253eaa	Yes, of course.<br>  <br>  External tuners connect to your TV via your S-Video, component, composite, HDMI or DVI inputs (some may also support using RF like you used to have to do with your VCR and then you'd set it to channel 3 to watch the VCR signal).<br>  <br>  Using a different/3rd party tuner is no different than connecting a DVD player or video game console to the set.  If it can support one of those (which 99.99999995% of TVs can) it can support a seperate tuner.  You just need to make sure the outputs on the tuner match the inputs on your TV (and since most TVs have multiple input types and most tuners have multiple output types, this shouldn't be an issue).
d30469773b5d889ab7704e82cb488a67aa	I can recommend some good sites to go to & some good stuff to get you started. When I first got my iPod, I was really weird about it & did all this research online before I got anything. Anyways, a really good site to check out is iLounge (ilounge.com). It has pretty much anything you can think of to do with iPods. At the top of the homepage, click on "Reviews & Accessories". There's neat stuff for your iPod & reviews of products so you don't waste your money on crappy stuff. Trust me, if you buy good stuff, you'll be so glad later. I haven't had to replace anything yet (nothing has broken) & the quality & sound is soo much better. Here's a link for a great cover (you should protect the outside of your iPod because it scratches VERY easily & that flimsy thing that it comes with pretty much sucks) - <a href="http://www.radtech.us/Products/SleevziPod.aspx." rel="nofollow">http://www.radtech.us/Products/SleevziPo...</a> I have the one for a video iPod in Red & trust me, it's awesome. BTW, that same store has a lot of other stuff for iPods. Also try the iStore (theistore.com). If you plan to take your iPod in the car, you should definitely get a travel charger (plugs into the cigarette lighter) & you'll need a way to listen to your iPod through the car's speakers (this varies, depending on what kind of audio system your car has). Also, a home speaker dock is a great thing to have. Mine also charges my iPod (as most do), is small but sounds amazing and even comes with a nifty travel case and a remote. The one I have is by Logitech, ok I just checked, it's called the mm50. I recommend it. I also use a Kensington Digital FM Transmitter to listen to my iPod in the car. And if you want it to sound even better, you can also get better headphones (much better) than the ones that come with the iPod. Mine are about middle-of-the-road pricewise but they sound great. They're Sony (model number is MDR-EX71SL). I really hope that helps you out. I went & looked at all my stuff to check out the names b/c I remember how confused I was when I was looking at all the different choices. By the way, I have a video iPod. If you have something else, some of my stuff might not work. So look at those sites I listed to find out what will work for your iPod. Good luck! (And I'm sorry this turned out to be so long)|`|AA12222450	get a skin for your iPod from speck products|`|d2cbec7de49f9dd9b72382f1e49f22caaa	you can get cool cases and skins at bestbuy or target. u can also buy rhinestones or fake jewels to stick on ur ipod which i luv! ihomes are also really cool (i hav a pink 1 the same color as my nano) but there kinda expensive.|`|dbebe170b33a957c5062b2826ea25218aa	get case
A86WX8Txaa	The video quality is ok, watchable on a 2.4" screen size at least. <br>  <br>  Set Up is real easy since its UMS, just Drag&Drop your files.  You can also use MTP if you prefer, so there is absolutely no need for additional software, except for your video conversions of course.<br>  <br>  At less than $160, it is worth buying, unless you want a more popular brand like the iriver.

(WMA takes up half the storage space of MP3 at the same quality) Like:<br>  <br>  For $40 you can get the Creative Zen Stone (1GB), which is similar to the iPod Shuffle, but the Stone has better sound quality. The Stone also comes in six colors.<br>  <br>  For $180 you can get the Cowon D2 (4GB). It has a MUCH larger screen than the nano and an SD card slot (for us much storage as you can buy SD cards). It can show videos and has a touch-screen interface. It has loads of features, great battery life, and great sound quality.<br>  <br>  Also for $180 is the Toshiba Gigabeat S. It has a bigger screen than an iPod Video, is compatible with more formats and has more features.

The first one would be to download the songs from limewire.com and dropping them into the iTunes library. The next one is to put songs off of your personal Cds. To do that you need to open iTunes and put the CD in. It should then show up on iTunes. Then just drag and drop the songs you want to the iTunes library.

r8CVFUTIaa	I also had a 4th gen iPod and I can sympathize with you, I had the same problem with mine. Before anything else, try to connect your iPod to your computer, if this works, your iPod is fine, your battery is the problem, but if you cannot connect your iPod to your computer, chances are your iPod's hard disk (look for a clicking noise at the back while you start your iPod) crashed
r8CVFUTIaa	As I said, same symptoms, first of all, i hadn't dropped my 4th gen iPod either, it starts with a simple lag in play, after which, I observed it skipped songs without me pushing a button, after which, I observed it keeps on displaying error messages and then restarts itself (which explains why it drains the battery) finally I connect it to my computer and my computer freezes, I took it to the apple store to have it checked out, voila! crashed hard drive<br>  <br>  Note: My iPod was about 2 yrs old too when that happened <br>  I can't blame you for being pissed, I was when it happened to me too.

A86WX8Txaa	If you cannot find many reviews it's because it is an unknown brand. For $200 you can get a Creative Zen Vision M, it does ALL the Mustek, except does NOT have a memory slot. Plus the Zen Vision M, plays DivX/XviD/WMV video files, not mp4 only like the Mustek. The screen size on the Zen is 2.5" vs 2.4" and the Mustek is a brick compared to the Zen Vision M's size. You can choose from 5 colors, record FM, use the organizer with the Zen Vision M also.<br>  <br>  The Mustek may be a little cheaper, but consider all the pros the creative Zen has.
A86WX8Txaa	It means you can add more memory in the cellphone by using a memory card: MicroSD, MMC, MMC-RS, MiniSD, Memory Stick, M2 etc. Usually cellphones have their own integrated memory on board, but it's really little, like 32MB or more. Expandable memory means you can put a memory card (up to 2GB) in your cellphone, where you can store music/videos/images.

They have moving parts and they are NOT meant for jogging.<br>  <br>  The Zen V is a flash player, so that's ok for you. It's hard to say how much music 8GB will hold because all music files are not of the same length or bitrate.

And yes, in your case, you'll get all 8GB for your music.<br>  <br>  The Zen V Plus doesn't support additional memory, so no, you can't use a memory card in it. <br>  <br>  A flash player with an expansion slot is the Sansa e280 (8GB). It has a color screen, better than the Zen V Plus, however, I wouldn't recommend it for jogging, it is a little fatter than the ZV+ and is not as "cute".<br>  <br>  Finally, yes, it is compatible with all major music stores (Napster, Rhapsody, Yahoo! etc.) as it is a PlayForSure player.|`|6skDWG5Yaa	no that much. just get a 30 gb ipod you will hanv a lot of memory.

URpSHVF9aa	well the difference between hdmi and component is that hdmi delivers alot more hd to your screen only if you have an hdtv<br>  component cables can be used on some sdtv and hdtv but it will deliver alot less hd than using hdmi<br>  <br>  resistance is a 4 player split-screen <br>  but that doesnt mean u cant turn it into 3 or 2 split screen.<br>  <br>  and the wi-fi depends on what type of internet connection you  have<br>  <br>  if you have high speed internet then it will go fast|`|dC7d5sy5aa	Component and HDMI cables both support HD. HDMI uses digital signals and also carries audio where as component is analogue and carries only video.<br>  <br>  The following is a list from best to worst including their resolution capabilities for transport:<br>  <br>  HDMI (1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  Component (1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  S-Video (480i)<br>  Composite (480i)<br>  Coaxial (480i)<br>  <br>  Many people say they find it difficult to distinguish between 720p and 1080i, but they can between 720p and 1080p. If you have a 1080p display you should certainly use HDMI if you only have 720p stick with the component and use optical or digital co-ax for audio.

The art style caught my eye and the violence is something very uncommon among wii games.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it would be a good game at the best and now it seems it is a great game. I honestly thought that the game couldn't live up to its hype but it seems it has. I haven't considered buying it but that changed when I saw all the awesome reviews.|`|qrB0QxN8aa	I am in the hype but I am going to wait until I read and watch some reviews before buying it (The force unleashed really burned me).  The hype is there because of how funny and over the top it is.  I think it may be as good as the preview said it was.|`|pVaw78Tlaa	Yes, its worth every penny.

YiGKt6gkaa	Halo wars is a good game if you like rts games and if your into halo, I just got it, and I am really happy with it. <br>  <br>  Resident evil 5 looks pretty confusing.  I am not familiar to the story at all, besides zombies, but I downloaded the demo, and found it pretty hard to move around.  The ammo reloading was weird, picking up ammo was weird, targeting was weird, I didn't like it.  Download the demo off of the market place and give it a try.<br>  <br>  Just keep downloading demos off of xbox live.

Vibrant scenery and large cities.  I can't believe you own a 360 and do not own this game.

Resident evil 4 was easily the best game on Game Cube and one of the top 4 PS2 games.  Capcom made it (resident evil 4) in less than 2 years.  Capcom has been working on resident evil 5 nearly the entire span of this generation (4 years!).  They know what succeeded in RE4 and have improved on it. It will not be in the same LEAGUE as any other game so far.  Now if you didn't like RE 4 ignore this.  If you never played it, PLAY IT and it will make up your mind.  GOOD LUCK!!|`|EUL3PGjcaa	i got halo wars when it came out and it is probably the best game that has came out for the 360 yet but also gears of war and gears of war 2 are also very good but if your birthday is in april you could also get 50 cent: blood on the sand|`|TDgjQcvoaa	Try Halo Wars, i have that game and let me tell you that Halo Wars is an amazing RTS.

6GIrW5eWaa	Keep your xbox clean and free of dust, keep it well ventilated. As others have suggested there may not be a way to keep it from happening but good house keeping certainly can't help. Do not buy fans or intercoolers that run off the xbox power supply. Do not store it on a carpeted floor. Do not block the vent holes. If you have a hard drive and you have the new software (nxe) and have the option of loading games to the HDD then do so. Obviously not all your games but the ones you tend to play the most. This will keep the system cooler by not having to run the disk motor 100% of the time. Good Luck with your system and welcome to the Xbox world.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	There isn't anything you can do to avoid it.  If you get it Microsoft is usually pretty good about getting it fixed for you through it warranty repair options.  Some systems have an additional warranty that covers ONLY the RRD, and they continue to claim that they fix it in updated models and elite systems, but has still shown up with all models of system up to now, so really no system is safe.<br>  <br>  Its a manufacturer's defect, it really has nothing to do with what you do or don't do with your system<br>  <br>  In my home with have 3 360s, two elites and one standard.  The stardard one is new and we replaced an older standard one with an elite because he had it repaired so many times we didn't want to take anymore chances with it.  Although Microsoft repaired it all those times for free, there was a lot of time involved with shipping, repairs and having a dead system sit around for awhile.|`|4IwVNpJ7aa	There is no real way of stopping the "RROD" and don't believe anything you read on the internet. But it's ok to get the "RROD" because when I had it happen, I got 1 month free Xbox Live Gold and my friend has had it happen 3 times twice he got a 1 month Gold card the other time he got 3000 Microsoft Points. So a week of not having an Xbox is well worth it in the end. So don't worry about the "RROD"
9mTctb7jaa	they record the video right out of the xbox, before it even goes to the TV. most likely they are using a computer to capture the video with something like ez cap or equivalent. that eliminates both the camcorder and the tape. once in the computer then the program can be edited and reformatted for you tube.

b2Tx1Kktaa	Well, Sony released a new 80gb that is exactly what the 40gb is just 2x the HDD.

fecUjSr1aa	The one previously suggested by Jenn is a good product. however, it uses a mini-dvd to store files, hence giving you a slight limitation on how long and how many videos you can take.

TmdTLHFYaa	I suggest you use Swapmagic disks to play burnt games as they won't work if you load up normally  Swapmagic disks cost around about 20.00 Pounds.|`|BR1yOqEfaa	Since you have the "Fatty" system, do the following:<br>  go to gamestop EB Games or any of your favorite store that sells used games and accessories. Pick up a PS2 network adapter. Purchase the largest IDE hard drive you can afford. Attach the hard drive to the network adapter and slide the drive into the PS2.<br>  go to HDLoader.org and buy the newest version. Use this to format your drive. You can now transfer your games to the hard drive and play them from there.<br>  <br>  If the games that you already on your computer, download winhiip and attach the PS2 hard drive to your computer. transfer the games through winhiip.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|OC1aACjoaa	I tried the slide disc tray out quickly thing... It isnt the way to go, just buy a modchip they are like 20 bucks and easy to install|`|hLg3o59Gaa	I highly frown upon using the quick swap method. It is not only a pain in the butt, it will also screw your PS2 up. <br>  <br>  Just go out and grab yourself a copy of Swap Magic or use HD Loader. There are much better ways of doing this that will not damage your system.<br>  <br>  Not to mention they are not very expensive. If you would like to learn more about backing up and playing copied video games I would like to recommend a book to you. <br>  <br>  For more info about backing up and playing copied console games, I would like to recommend the only 100% guaranteed to work true, tried and tested book of video game copying techniques at <a href="http://www.gamecopyingguide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamecopyingguide.com/</a><br>  They have a limited time special running here though <a href="http://www.gamecopyingguide.com/youtube/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamecopyingguide.com/youtube/</a>
nSXlffmpaa	For this problem it can be extremely costly. If your X box 360 is near your wireless router you can connect it with a long USB cord which can be valued up to $30 and a easy way to connect to live instantly is to buy a wireless adapter for your x box 360. Which instantly connects wireless but it is $100. Good Luck

This prevents people from stealing games and is a smart move by MS.|`|N2p30Mo4aa	when you install it on your hard drive, you still need the disc.

The ring of death happens to a lot of people, but doesn't happen to everyone.  I have had my xbox 360 for a year, and the only problems I have had with it is just not plugging it in correctly.  My opinion is that if you don't spill stuff on it and keep it unplugged during a storm it should be FINE.  <br>  <br>  If you are really unsure about the safety of your xbox, then you can get a warranty for it.  Not sure how it is done, but Microsoft should reimburse you 100% of what you paid for it (try looking on their website xbox.com  I think).  If it does break and it's under a warranty then Microsoft will reimburse you. <br>   <br>  If it doesn't work out of the box, then it should be fine.  It's a good idea to get a warrenty because they are usually pretty cheap.|`|3HmO1EBcaa	Alot of stuff effects your xbox..Xbox's are known for over heating. The fans in the back of them suck horribly. If you play acouple hours a day..almost everyday it will probably last 2-3 years..but it also depends on how well you treat it..and your enviroment..if your room is dusty and hot..well the heat will heat up the xbox faster and the dust is obviously not good for it. So basically just take care of it.|`|j4nWmewqaa	dont worry about that if its brand new just prevent dust from getting into ur system, keep the xbox upward if its on carpet.|`|I7r6y2rgaa	almost every year on the dot my xbox overheats and get the rings of death... im suffering from boredome of that exact reason|`|r1pMegENaa	No issues if you keep it well ventilated and fairly dust free.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You do not need HDMI to play in 1080i/1080p.  You can use component cables to get 1080p.<br>  <br>  To play in HD, you just need to plug in the component cables (blue,green, red), switch it to HD on the cord, and then go to the menu blade to change the game output to 720p/1008i/1080p, whatever your TV is capable of.<br>  <br>  If you have HDMI output, then use that.  It gives slightly better picture quality than component, but it's going to be hard to tell the difference.|`|kUpAQ65Kaa	You'll need an HDMI cable to play in full HD (1080p/i).<br>  <br>  Here's a guide to HDMI cables:<br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/hdmi-cable/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/hdmi-cable/</a><br>  <br>  Buy the cheapest one you find, they all do the same, there's no difference except for length and the color of plating at the ends. Plating colors doesn't change performance or anything (usually silver is cheaper).
6GIrW5eWaa	I believe it is midnight although I have waited up a couple of times for music to be released on RB and it has come later. Some come right on time. If it isn't there at midnight or minutes after trying logging off and back on I don't know why but other times when I did this it did show up. Good Luck.|`|SBcxooLsaa	why should it matter you can buy it at anytime you want and i think exactley at midnight|`|qCQbYrAHaa	The answer to this question really depends on where you live. Content on Xbox Live Marketplace is released simultaneously nationwide, but according to your timezone the actual time will differ.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, publishers will wait until midnight is reached in the west (United States). So while Los Angelos may get their stuff at exactly midnight (LA's midnight), New York will typically receive it at 4:00 AM (NY's 4 AM).

eVptHOOBaa	Aside from the motor, there are a few differences that may be absolutely insignificant, or the deal breakers to you, if you can use those features, as they are mostly the ones that are needed in some specific situations, and not all will take advantage of them...<br>  <br>  1. D80 has a secondary small LCD on top that has all the information, just like in the old days. It does not use main (power hungry) color LCD for showing the exposure, etc. This is one of the things that made my day when I was choosing between D40 and D80 (before D60 was out). I was so used to it on my older (film, and digital) cameras, that after playing with D40 a bit, I just could not accept having to use that main LCD and no screen on top to quickly glance at....<br>  <br>  2. D80 has phenomenal battery life. At least 800-1000 shots on one charge (with decent LCD use, such as 3 sec. preview of each shot taken). I believe D60 has less, though it's pretty good on its own.<br>  <br>  3. I may be mistaken, but I don't think D60'ies built in flash can work as CLS commander, D80'ies definitely can - I use mine quite a bit in that capacity. CLS (Creative light system) means that if you get SB-600 or better external flash, you can fire it off camera for better lightning, but in full TTL mode, controlled by built-in flash. With D60 you'd need an extra SB-800 on top of your camera to control off-camera flash(es).<br>  <br>  4. D80 has a slightly better viewfinder. It's more expensive pentaprism, vs. pentamirror on D60. Better magnification. If you care....<br>  <br>  On the other side D60 is smaller and lighter, so hauling it around is a bit more pleasant experience all in all, although I find a slightly heavier and solid D80 body to be very nice for those hand-held long exposure shots...<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Firstly, i need to correct a few things the first person said<br>  <br>  a) The D60 can mount all Nikkor lenses, whether they are DX, or made for film cameras originally. <br>  <br>  b) The D80 is not a ' PRO level body '. <br>  <br>  The D80 and the D60 are very similar. Besides the build quality, and the Autofocus motor, you do not get much else with the D80. In my opinion, it is not a very substantial upgrade. An ' upgrade ' in my opinion would be to go with Nikon's D300, or even the D200, which offer quite a bit more than the D60. If you are looking for an upgrade in built quality ( although the D80 isn't weather-sealed or housed with Magnesium Alloy ), and want a better feel, with an additional feature or two, get the D80. If you are looking for Much better build quality, and a plethora of features, get the D300, used would be fine.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Here is a side-by-side comparison of the D60 and D80:<br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=nikon_d60%2Cnikon_d80&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a><br>  <br>  I don't recommend you upgrade to the D80... if you're going to upgrade, consider the D300 instead.<br>  <br>  Here is the side-by-side comparison of the D60 and D300.<br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=nikon_d300%2Cnikon_d60&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a>|`|qR4xcTfaaa	There is not much of a difference between these cameras.<br>  However, you should seriously look in to buying a D80, it is much more solid than D60, it is a PRO level camera, much more solid built for long use and the price just dropped by 33%.(less than $500)<br>  With the D80 you can use *ALL* NIKON NIKKOR Auto Focus lenses, but with the D60 you can only use DX lenses. This will prevent you from upgrading in the future to a FX full frame cameras.<br>  <br>  Also the D80 have Dinimic capabilities that the D60 lack.<br>  <br>  Therefor you should definitely go with the D80 it is very user friendly you will be very happy with it as I am, I guaranty it. <br>  You can buy it on Ebay new with many accessories for less than $500.|`|d55HYaktaa	The D80 has a pentaprism instead of a pentamirror, more AF points, it's bigger and has a larger grip, has depth-of-field preview button; it can work as a wireless controller in the creative lighting system, being able to control up to two groups of SB-600/SB-800/SB-900 flashs.<br>  <br>  The D80 will not work with all Nikkor lens, that is not true. The tilt-shift lens (perpective control) will not work fine due to the aperture control. Only the semi-pro and pro series (D??? / D? / D?X) can use these lens.<br>  <br>  I think it's better to save money and get a D90 instead of the D80.<br>  <br>  Btw... the D80 is not a pro camera, and the D90 is not too.<br>  <br>  The entry-level amateur cameras are for beginners, advanced amateur for enthusiasts, semi-pro for sports/wildlife, pro for studio/events/weddings.<br>  <br>  D50/D40/D40x/D60 -> entry-level amateur (no built-in AF motor, except D50)<br>  D70/D70s/D80/D90 -> advanced amateur (AF motor, pentaprism, CLS controller)<br>  D100/D200/D300/D700 -> semi pro (weather sealing, fast AF, fast continuous shooting)<br>  D1/D1H/D1X/D2/D2H/D3/D3X -> pro (studio flash connector, tilt-shift lens, faster continuous shooting)

1HtTxOOQaa	LBP and RE5. I played DMC4 a year back and was quiet disappointed. Well, that may be cause I was playing God Of War 2 before that, but still after sometime the game gets really repetitive where you mash a few buttons, do some combos and voila.. you win... fun but boring after sometime. SF4 is an awesome game, but again after 3 weeks with it, I have started to get bored off it as well.<br>  <br>  I love LBP. It's too addictive. It's the happiest game ever (i literally mean the statement). I feel happy playing the game and that is a testimony of a great game. I have been playing it for very long and absolutely love it.<br>  <br>  RE5 is also a good game. It's scary and really fun. I would prefer it over the other 3 (LBP first cause it's a must buy).|`|AA10365008	LittleBigPlanet is an obvious choice. If you have a credit card, get it from Amazon.com, as they have a sale on it right now.<br>  For your other game, I would say either Resident Evil 5 or Street fighter 4. It really depends on what you prefer.|`|RxLgqYzkaa	The two best I would choose would be Resident Evil 5 and Little Big Planet. You should see the trailers or info videos of them and compare and contrast but it mainly depends on what kind of gamer you are.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Resident Evil 5<br>  and<br>  Little Big Planet|`|gNO5NIgoaa	I think it depends on what type of gamer you are, but I would go with Resident Evil 5 for sure. The game itself is pretty fun and the added co-op is gonna be pretty interesting. It has a lot of freedom in my opinion. You can move around and do a lot of things and what not. I think Street Fighter 4 is also gonna be good, but I think you'll get bored of it quickly so I think you should wait until it gets cheaper and buy like a used one because those kinda games get boring quickly. It's just button mashing and fighting and what not. Little Big Planet looks interesting too, but I don't really understand the point of that video game, but I guess it's fun to mess around with that game. Devil May Cry 4 is a game I haven't played so I don't know too much about that one.<br>  <br>  I would go with Resident Evil 5 for sure though and maybe Little Big Planet or Devil May Cry 4 depending on how fun it is. =P|`|aDWQfWJ3aa	Resident Evil 5 and LBP.|`|mjNMwArAaa	Resident Evil 5 and Little Big Planet|`|vBA6ZqAHaa	Devil may cry 4 is pretty cheap nowadays<br>  resident evil looks sweet, and littlbigplanet probably has several hundred hours of entertainment in it.<br>  street fighter 4's entertainment value is limeted<br>  i would get some older cheaper games like bioshock and assasins creed. gta 4 is also only $40 nowadays.|`|raEUval8aa	That would be Resident Evil 5.....and Littlebigplanet.

YlyN73Jnaa	The Wii provides plenty of entertainment for casual or hardcore gamers and is out of this world if you love platform adventures, role playing games(RPG), party and mini games, racing, and fighting. Some awesome games that fit in these genres are Super Paper Mario, Super Mario Galaxy, Wario Land Shake It, De Blob, Sonic and the Secret Rings,  Lego Star Wars, Guinness World Records The Video Game, Mario Party 8, Wario Ware Smooth Moves, Family Playground Games, Super Smash Bros Brawl, and Mario Kart. The wii also has a few first person shooters if you're into explosions and weapons like Halo 3, Call of Duty 4, and Gears of War. The bottom line is that the nintendo wii has lots to offer and you should purchase this console system as soon as possible. Hope this helps!

6GIrW5eWaa	Ryan has provided you with the best information and deserves the best answer, if you needed any help in that department. There are many reasons that you should do as he suggest. if you use the disk drive less and the hard drive more you will certainly extend the life of your console. Less chance for RROD is definitely more than enough reasons to load one or two games onto the hard drive? I think so.<br>  <br>  Edit: by the way it has nothing to do with lazy, you still have to get up and put the disk in the game. The mis-information that goes on in answers is just amazing.|`|GFHRpDE4aa	People do it when they have the elite xbox's cause they have a lot more memory, and they are to lazy to get up and put a disk in there xbox, or they are to lazy and don't want to go out and buy it when they could just sit on there couch and buy it off the xbox live market place.<br>  haha idk if this is true but that's just my theory.<br>  <br>  But i think it's stupid, because once you buy it your stuck with it, like seriously if you hated the game it would just be a waste of money because you could never return it or sell it, it's kinda stupid to me.<br>  <br>  hope i helped  :]|`|8H9eSDm8aa	It extends the life of your xbox 360. Yes your hard disk probably spins a bit more than usually, but it can take it. It also speeds up loading times on pretty much every game except halo 3, and in that case it slows it way down. When the CD drive is spinning all the time, it heats up your system, warmer than if it was sitting in the dashboard, which also can lower your life. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way, in five years would you rather have to replace your hard drive, or your entire xbox? <br>  <br>  I suggest just installing games that you play the most, like rock band, or a game that your gonna be playing for a few more years. Something like assassins creed where you beat it and your done I wouldn't install. <br>  If you have a 20 gb especially take the advice above. If you have a 60 gb or 120 gb I wouldn't worry unless you have tons of games.|`|Fto3FH8Zaa	Actually the save data is separate than the game, and doesn't get deleted, plus it keeps you disk drive from running constantly so that it doesn't wear out as fast, I do it all the time.<br>  (P.S.

AA10225512	Nokia N73 really slows down a lot with use. The best solution may be to delete unnecessary files from your memory stick if you use one. The N73 was still slow but not that much anymore after i deleted files.

Dip a Qtip in the alchol and then dab it on a paper towel to get most of it off. Lightly clean the lens. Give it 5-10 minutes to dry and try a game. I also suggest getting canned air and blowing the duast out of your system before cleanig the lens as a spinnig game disk and the fnas in the system can cause another dust bunny to crawl onto your lens.<br>  If that does not work, do a search for "PS2 POT adjustment".<br>  That will almost always do the trick.

Give him a "minimum" amount you will sell it for (e.g. "I don't want less than $50 for it"). Then, go down from there. Maybe he'll say, "$30." You could say, "$40." And you keep going on like that until you two agree on a price.<br>  <br>  Always remember, you are the seller, and he is the buyer, so in the end, you get to really decide how much he will pay for it (but if he doesn't want to pay the amount you want him to, he doesn't have to buy it!).<br>  <br>  Good luck, and have fun!<br>  Blake
CIhZpndnaa	I would say Gears of War 2 for 360 and LittleBigPlanet for PS3. But if you really like online shooter games, I can say you'll enjoy playing Resistance 2 with 60 players online.|`|ZkB2RoLWaa	Well cod5 has an amazing online multiplayer and so  does fable 2 where you can quest with other people. it really depends on if you want to play online or not. If you want to play online get gears2 and cod 5 because they are both very indepth and can be played for hours and hours   but if you want to have fun get littlebigplanet and fable. with all the games that your picked any combo will be awesome. hope that helped if you need any more info just email me.|`|b9UwSI37aa	i also have both and i am geting gears 2 and Resistance. also for the ps3 you can get solcom|`|nCSO7315aa	360: i am getting Fallout 3 because it looks hella epic but if you want a role playing game you could also get fable 2 if you want more of a fantasy than fallout 3 being more action/ war<br>  if you have played cod 4, then cod 5 will be a letdown for its worse graphics and akward guns.<br>  gears also looks good but i dont like its online play<br>  <br>  ps3: dont have one but again fallout looks awesome, resistance is ps3's cornerstone game so you cant go wrong there and littlebigplanet looks cheesy yet addictive<br>  <br>  have fun lol|`|AA10017847	getting a game for one console that is also available for another makes no sense, so i would buy games that are exclusive to each console, like Gears 2 for 360 and Resistance 2 for PS3
gkaZE5xgaa	To say a 360 is red ring of death free, is saying that a car will never break down, or that a computer will never get a virus.<br>  <br>  No Xbox 360 are red ring of death free, but the newer the console, the less likely a red ring of death will occur.<br>  <br>  Personally, I keep my Xbox 360 well vented, clean (via dusting), and kept in a cool place. I have had my 360 from its first release day in Australia and it still functions and hasn't had red ring of death.<br>  <br>  So, buy a 360, and look after, and then you will be red ring of death free|`|AA10017847	no console is safe from the ring, but around april, microsoft released a new line of 360's that have a bigger CPU, and thus more resistant to the ring of death.  Also, you cant play your games worrying about when your console is going to break.  do you drive your car worrying when it will somehow or another break?

Get in touch with Microsoft and they will handle it for you. They are fully aware of the problem. Unfortunately, I've had to send my son's in 3 times in the past few years but they were extremely great about repairing it for free. I never spent one dime to send it in or to get it fixed, they took care of everything for me. Just call and explain the problem but be prepared to give them the serial number from your xbox and have a pen and paper ready to take down some info from the customer service rep. They finally ended up sending us a new hard drive.

Xxviy63Paa	Not enough info. But my gut says that the "output" on the tv may be a second input, especially if it's an SDTV, the last few years of standard-def TV's commonly had 2 sets of A/V inputs and no outputs. If your TV in fact doesn't have an output, you can solve the problem by getting a signal splitter for about $3, and some extra RCA cables.<br>  <br>  I just looked at the specs. Are you trying to run the signal from your tv into the camera? The camera doesn't have a video input, except from the DV tapes that it records onto, which it can play back. That is, even if the other TV thing is an output, there's no input A/V on the camera. It's an A/V output as well. Can't capture video.<br>  <br>  To get the gameplay to record, you'll just have to use the camera as a camera - start up the ps3, throw in a DV tape and press play on the camera after focusing it on the screen. Not the greatest way to make a video, but that's the only way that camera will work.<br>    It says the camera works as a webcam, but again, it doesn't need a video-in for that.

af96mcl1aa	I am right with you on the disappointment of good Nintendo games. <br>  They were right on with the innovative-ness of the Wii, but they fell short on the games. Unfortunately its a lot of third party developers, and the games fall short (In time/graphics/overall input), and it really put Nintendo in a snag. I have all 3 next gen systems, and I can tell you that the 360 would probably be the best one to buy if your looking for another console. The PS3's graphics are better, but not by that much of a difference to me personally, to have to shell out the extra money. Also a lot of the PS3's games are also for the 360. So it really depends on if your a graphics guy, but seeing as you opted for a Wii, i'm guessing your not. If your into Resident Evil, they are coming out with a special addition red 360 to commemorate the game. Its like a bundle pack. The game, the 360, and a red controller for just a little more then the normal 360 is (If i remember correctly). I saw it in a Best Buy ad, but i'm sure you can find one at Wal-mart cheaper.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|qgaBVtnCaa	sorry but no...buy a ps3|`|LnYr2dLfaa	A re-make of the Metroid Prime for the Gamecube is being made for the Wii.<br>  <br>  Resident Evil 5<br>  Dead Rising: Chop 'Til You Drop<br>  Curse Mountain<br>  Deadly Creatures<br>  House of the Dead: Overkill<br>  Fatal Frame 4<br>  <br>  There should be a new Zelda title released early to mid next year.|`|WUQ9dNVbaa	Well a new Resident Evil as been announced for the Wii and there's still The Conduit coming out as well.

fFqzD3aMaa	Take a screw out and bring it to the hardware store. There is a thread measuring board you can use.|`|cG9q0mcKaa	You might have noticed that the screws were neither phillips or straight. The 360 uses Torx screwdrivers. The sizes you need for the 360 are 8,10. They're available at Radio Shack in a kit for about ten dollars.
RpCwfcRzaa	No. You need to buy a battery charger made for rechargeable batteries. Otherwise the batteries could explode if you try the cable.|`|af96mcl1aa	No, you got to use a charger for them. Thats the one thing I hate about the wireless controller is batteries. It would've been a smart move on the developers part to make it where you can recharge the controller by just plugging it in like how it is with the PS3. Microsoft and Nintendo will catch on sooner or later. :)

59Rd381caa	I don't know dude, I sold my Pokemon Diamond. All I need to tell you is that by sharing with my friends I got all 3 starter Pokemon and raised them to about lvl 70, I had a Dialga at lvl 70, and the Garitina at lvl 76. (If you don't know where to get Garitina I have the guide and I can explain it to you)<br>  <br>  1. In the woods up where thise caves are? I forget what's it's called, it's after you beat the elite 4... they have lvl wild pokemon<br>  <br>  2. No I think you're good<br>  <br>  3. I would wait, because if memory serves their pokemon get as high as lvl 66<br>  <br>  4. I'd say you should have at least 2 lvl 70 pokemon<br>  <br>  I wouldn'tve answered, but I was obbssesed with pokemon and I sold my diamond and saphire games but now I REALLY want them back because I just started playing my Pokemon Silver again. I also think I might get Platinum.|`|MYMpCrEYaa	go ahead and go through the leage as a practice run and then where you loose see what mistake u made|`|BMConIedaa	There are faqs for all you questions here.<br>  <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/game/925601.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/game...</a><br>  <br>  Read through their walk-thrus, and see what worked for other people.<br>  <br>  You may want to level up your Floatzel a bit, since some good water attacks may help with some of the things they'll throw at you.  You'll probably want all your pokemon in the high 50s.  Level up in the cave outside the League and the water route leading up to that.<br>  <br>  Your pokedex should be all filled out when you take out the Elite 4 and the League Champion.
jxpV13rTaa	i love it and its not full of glitches. online isnt too bad either. worth getting if you like hockey games|`|pOi0wewIaa	Yes sure if your a hockey person.

cxJSW5p4aa	a sim card is a sim card, regardless of phones. it will work but you may have to cal att and change your data plan to a blackberry.
8H9eSDm8aa	Ah yes, I had the same exact problem. Both of those games are dual layered, which means that the disc holds lots more info then a standard disc, and also means that the Wii has to read data much faster and more accurately. Sometimes dust can collect very easily on the laser lens, and for a normal game, like mario kart, it has no effect at all. But when its reading a dual layer disk, it will crash like that. <br>  <br>  Now don't go out and get a compressed can of air to clean it up, that will only damage it further, because there is already lots of dust in the console itself, and that will make it worse, and possibly void the warranty.<br>  <br>  They have special cleaning equipment that will fix the problem, and right now I think its free, even without a warranty. <br>  <br>  Anyway I live in AZ and the closest center was California, so I sent out my Wii and without a week and a half I got it back, and it worked just fine. <br>  <br>  Here is the link, just click continue, or read more to get the fix.<br>  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/ts/gameSSBB.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a>|`|CqddTJKfaa	Call the nintendo hotline. I had the same problem and they fixed it. Theres no use trying to fix it yourself. They have put it together in a way that no one else can take it apart. Believe me, my dad and and I tried with many tools.<br>  <br>  Contrary to one answerer, it does cost money if your warranty has expired. Its was only a few hundred dollars(Australian Dollars) though.<br>  <br>  It would be equivalent to around $150 American dollars without warranty.|`|OblSdMaaaa	Try reformatting your Wii (restore it to factory settings).  If it is still doing the same thing with every game you try to play then I would rule that the Wii is broken in some way.
zGX1ObeUaa	heyy;<br>  i too was trying to join <br>  gamerchix and actually <br>  there is a link but it wasn't<br>  working for me.<br>  go to yahoo.com<br>  put gamerchix the first site that it gives<br>  you pressread the frist paragragh where<br>  it says If you or someone you know would like to meet other women to play games with, send TriXie an email <br>  on the frist paragragh thats your link to send trixie a emial<br>  but i agree with milk there<br>  exactly as the guys who<br>  talish on xbox. Which really irritates<br>  me. You try talking to some and just<br>  mute you like wth.<br>  <br>  but still you can try to go to<br>  the site i gave you but hey not all<br>  females there are ***** but hey if <br>  you play call of duty: modern warfare <br>  o call of duty: world at war add me <br>  kari605 :) o i'll just add you|`|RpCwfcRzaa	It's just a group where female gamers play together. Anyone can join as long as you're a girl and there's no way to prove someone isn't a girl anyway. I believe you have to send an email to Trixie proving that you're female in order to join. I really don't endorse them because as much as they say they're about supporting fellow female gamers and proving females are just as good as males, they're attention seekers who separate themselves for no other reason than to seek special treatment and attention. They are rude and petty and don't represent the female gamer population in a very flattering light. I suggest looking around and joining random games on Live. There are tons of nice female gamers who just want to have a good time playing like everyone else. Good luck and have fun on Live.|`|VlmN3TLeaa	Well, its better if u call MS and ask them how to join it.<br>  Most likely there won't be a link at xbox.com bcuz thats only for like updates on new stuff that are coming out and ya.<br>  Well just give MS a call at 1-800-4MY-XBOX.<br>  Hoep this helps.
1HtTxOOQaa	Yes, it's one of the best shooter out there. The graphics are awesome, better than any game on a console yet. Even better than than Gears 2 and MGS4 and only second to Crysis on PC. The game is really intense. The battle scenes are epic.<br>  I enjoyed the campaign even more than COD4 and gears 2.. that in it's self is a compliment. <br>  The online is one of the main strengths of the game. The game use COD4 like class system and leveling up system. If you liked COD4 type online system, then you will like KZ2. <br>  All in all, it's a solid shooter. It's a must buy if you own a PS3. It's probably the best shooter on a console yet.|`|vPhVkYUUaa	yeah it is good but its a bit more tricky than cod4 i am struggling with the on line but i always rocked at cod.  not sure if it lives up to the hype but a very good game regardless.|`|pl2SocVKaa	ohh yeah the campaign isn't the best out of a fps game but online is so yeah i recommend it for you|`|jxpV13rTaa	good? its the best! is has the best graphics of any game on any console. highly anticipated. it is the next generation of shooters. simply a must have.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	Im not a huge fan of FPS but i loved killzone 2|`|QIlhmWwBaa	yes<br>  killzone 2 is a must buy for ps3 owners|`|jN5SXl5Caa	Addicting, totally addicting.

Wdp3HuuMaa	Yes it is.  There are replacement kits offered at various online retailers.  The first that comes to mind is Parts Express.  Installing a new one should be pretty easy as long as you can get the old one off cleanly.
1JsWMX0daa	3 things :<br>    You need a camera with a good optical zoom, and 6.0 megapixels or higher, because i assume if you are taking pictures of landscapes than you will print out alot of 8x10s or larger so you will need a higher number of megapixels to keep the picture from pixelating when enlarging. also pick out one with a good lense. just look at the actual eye of the lens and compare them. you will note that some are larger & will let in more light while others are merely little bigger than a pin hole.
4nMdQn8vaa	You should get it.It is so much fun.I love it.You can design the inside of your house and when you pay off your mortgage you get a bigger house.You can go to the city and shop a lot.There is always something new to do.I love it.I give it a ten of ten.|`|9roHz7ZTaa	It is not hard to find friends, as there are many websites dedicated to the game. It is very easy to find a community of friends to play with.<br>  <br>  What happens is that up to three people can visit another persons town, and that is where the multiplayer comes in. You can also chat with people, and send items and messages back and forth.|`|aoxJuCxGaa	You should get it. I have it, and I spend hours playing it.

Online is free on PS3 and it is better than Xbox Live. You pay 50$ a year for Xbox's online service. Honestly you can't go wrong with PS3. Xbox's have a 33% failure rate while PS3s have just 1%. PS3 has a larger and game collection with more of a variety of games. PS3 has a lot of great games coming out this year like Killzone 2, God of War III, InFAMOUS, MAG and Uncharted: Among Thieves. PS3 has better sports games (exclusives like NBA 09 The Inside and MLB: The Show) It has better racing games (Motorstorm, Ridge Racer, Grand Turismo)Trust me you will not be disappointing in the PS3.

Not some ordinary one. You need to buy a HD tv (most of them are plasma).

xFjZgfBtaa	If you can get what you say, I'd say make sure you can get the HD first, (I'd suggest the 120 GB drive, downloading many games to it does help in many cases and many demos and such can really zap space fast)  You'd be surprised how often an auction on Ebay can double or more in the last few minutes of it running.  The hard drive is also built well and shouldn't be a problem bought used, though be sure to format it to purge it of what the former owner did.<br>  <br>  The only other thing that is different is the pack in games, though on both ends can be bought cheep at Gamestop and are in both cases not exactly games that will hold you long (I thought Lego IJ and Kung Fu Panda are fun... for one play though)|`|3NS56GXiaa	try waiting for the for the Limited Edition Resident Evil 5 Bundle that comes out at march 13. i heard in other websites that it has a new jasper chip sets.|`|SkhNMxnlaa	Get the pro<br>  <br>  The arcade is not good for so many reasons, the pro has some really good deals at the moment, so go check them out<br>  <br>  pro all the way!!!|`|212d130233838c3aa8f1ba3e3874f7d7aa	just buy a pro since it has the newer motherboard which improves overheating and will likely help you avoid the Red Ring of Death.|`|RpCwfcRzaa	I'd go with the Arcade then.

HVQFVtelaa	The actual speed of your scooter is a product of the horsepower of the motor and the gearing. The lithium battery would likely only give you more time between charging.<br>  <br>  In rare cases you can increase the voltage to the motor and achieve a small horsepower increase, but the people doing it are experts and the motor manufacturer told them the motor was made for it.<br>  <br>  The people that get speed increases with gearing changes spend a lot of time and money doing it. They have time and money to burn for fun, do you?<br>  <br>  Don't get in too big a hurry to modify your scooter, you could damage it.

Ur6H8gwkaa	Is this your TV?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dace.com.au/Infos/Display_Samsung%20LA32T51BX.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dace.com.au/Infos/Display_Sam...</a><br>  <br>  On a side note, far too many people giving answers when they have no idea what they are talking about. <br>  <br>  I think three people mentioned 720i. There is no such thing. Based on the age and size, it's safe to say that this is a 720p set. There are no LCD flat panels that are 1080i. In the past few years, 1080i in regards to LCD flat panels is just a source compatibility thing, not an actual display spec.<br>  <br>  No HDMI was farily common a couple of years ago, especially on small sets like this. So yes, it's a 720p set. Even though it might actually have 768 pixels on the short side. DVI can support HD signals, but carries no sound. Component can carry 720p, so you have two HD inputs.|`|4BoteYDwaa	I just learned that pretty much all of the new t.v's are 720p minimum. I have a 32" Samsung that is roughly 6 years old, its a 720.

QE71sNC3aa	Burning your DVDs slower at 4X or 6X will increase the write quality and you'll very likely find they play well in any DVD player capable of playing a store-bought DVD then.<br>  <br>  If you're recording on DVD+R discs, setting your burning software to book type to DVD-R can help too.|`|0hbpCSwiaa	The cheaper the DVD player the less likely the manufacturer gave a damn about smooth playback. If your parents have a DVD player that works with scratchy DVDs then that is probably what you should buy. Standard DVD players are pretty damn cheap these days. If it doesn't cost more than $50 then you will probably be dissapointed. The cheap players hiccup when the DVD starts to run on the second layer. with or without scratches.|`|UeZcue6jaa	I've had good experience with Pioneer DVD players playing and tracking discs that other players hiccup on. Just recently I started using a Denon DVD 1940 CI that seems to play everything. The Pioneers I've had were around 100 dollars and the new Denon was a closeout for 150, down from 369. I had a cheaper 80 dollar RCA player that was really fussy. Had nothing but good luck with Pioneer and Denon.

Also, you could create you own level and share it to the world. And see how good your imagination compare to the pros who builds pretty good levels.<br>  <br>  The game is rated E which means all age (Yes, even babies) can play this game. From 1 year old to 999 years old. It doesn't really matter how old you are if your playing a little kids game.<br>  <br>  The only time where age is a problem is that when a 12 year old playing a 18 year old game because it could affect the 12 year old's life style and his/ her life by reacting or like doing the same stuff in the 18 year old game.

It is built into the camera body, so ANY lens will work with it, unlike the Nikon where you need to buy lenses specific for stabilisation.  <br>  <br>  The Nikon D40/D40X/D60 don't have an auto-focus motor either, so you may wish to avoid those or you will be stuck in manual focus on the vast majority of Nikon lenses available, especially used lenses.<br>  <br>  The Sony A200 is excellent and the price/features ratio is unmatched.|`|AbRfd29Haa	Any DSLR is going to offer you high-end features: RAW photo formats (each manufacturer has their own, a few are starting to use Adobe's DNG cross-platform standard), manual focus and exposure, multi-zoned auto-focus and exposure, and various other controls. <br>  <br>  The Nikon D40 someone mentioned is a great starter camera, but the standard kit lens is not a image stabilization lens. If you're shakey with a camera, you will learn in time to hold it stable, but time it will take. You should definitely look for a model with a stabilization system... these are excellent today. Canon and Nikon put this in the lens, while a few of the other brands (Pentax/Hoya and Sony, to name two) manage an anti-shake system by moving the image sensor, so it works with any lens. I usually recommend Canon and Nikon (take you pick), but it does look like Sony's in the game for real these days (they bought up the old Minolta-Konica SLR line, but Sony's also a big gun in the camcorder business, so they know their tech). <br>  <br>  Going back to Amazon, there's the Canon XS, for just under $500 with an image stabilization (IS) kit lens.. a great value! Like many newer models, this also includes a cleaning system, to help shake dust off the sensor. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-10-1MP-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B001CBKJGG/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236666378&sr=1-14" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-10-1MP-Digit...</a><br>  <br>  Nikon's answer to that Canon is the Nikon D60, which is similar: 10Mpixel sensor, dust reduction, other great features, including a stabilization lens (Nikon calls it "VR" rather than "IS"):<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6G/dp/B0012OGF6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236666569&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digit...</a><br>  <br>  Sony's entry in this category is the A200K, with in-camera stabilization. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Digital-SteadyShot-Stabilization-18-70mm/dp/B00125MHVM/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236666682&sr=1-4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Digital-Stead...</a><br>  <br>  You can find full reviews of these, and also read the user-reviews, as they often tell you how people feel a short time after they get their cameras. <br>  <br>  Anti-shake technology isn't a miracle cure... it can give you a few extra f-stops, or as many as five, depending on your natural steadiness. If you're shooting at very high speeds, hand shake is usually not a major issue. But you might consider a tripod or monopod to help you out with that shakiness. <br>  <br>  For the record, I own a Canon EOS Rebel Xt, a Nikon D70, and a Sony HVR-A1 camcorder, so I'm pretty unbiased.|`|9447d6d4627edef320b8495e7ad8a770aa	Although the Nikon D40 and Canon 400D Rebel XTi are entry level priced dSLRs, neither have image stabilization. For a maybe $100 more you could get the Pentax K200D with Shake Reduction. I couldn't seem to find the K1000D on Amazon, look at that too. If you can't spend the extra money, you can use a higher shutter speed, a tripod or start meditating 20 minutes per day.|`|e2o6hnLRaa	Canon XS, XSi, or Nikon D60.<br>  They all have image stabilization.<br>  Get a tripod if you shake a lot.<br>  Get a Nikon D90 if you need to record movie.<br>  The lens zooms further too.|`|ajNTSffmaa	Canon:  XS or XSI<br>  Nikon:  D60<br>  <br>  All three are great starter DSLRs and come with image stabilization lenses in the kits.

I would say, that when you log into t-mobile, their should be a parental control section. You have to find that, and then it will probably ask you for a password if you want to turn it off. You will need to hack the password (just like any other password hacking, I don't have the time to tell you, but I use a password generator, look it up on youtube as "password hack"). Then, once you log into parental control section, change the email address, so that it doesn't  send an email to your parents reminding them that they turned it off (incase it was a mistake). Then go ahead, and turn off the 10pm block.|`|BnistnrIaa	your parents probably put it on<br>  then find a computer hacker. you should post this on computer catagory or something

EpvHhbByaa	Someone's been looking at some porn. XD<br>  <br>  Anyways, the wii's history will never be shown to anyone. However, the router can trace where you've been (since you need the router to connect to the internet). If your dad knows how to do that then you're screwed. Fortunately most people don't know how to check where the router's been at. So unless your dad knows how check router history, you're good.<br>  <br>  Stop looking at porn. I've done it, you could too.|`|qgaBVtnCaa	yes it can be done, your client software (browser) connects to the router in order to make a request in some server storing the website that you are visiting. In other words the router makes the request for you, and it can store those links in its internal memory. You can access sites through another pc, serving as whats called a Proxy, and prevent this problem. I don't know if you can configure your Wii's web browser to use a proxy server, but it would do the job .|`|6xMkf08eaa	The only place the internet history will be shown is in the router, and that's if logging is enabled (which usually isn't be default)..<br>  <br>  The only other way for the WII's browsing history to show up on that other computer is if they have some type of packet capturing software, which I seriously doubt you have.|`|80piiicYaa	someone's been lookin at some porno. i dont think so it might b on the wii's history|`|yHc0PAmfaa	porn freak... lol|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Naughty Naughty ^_^<br>  <br>  Yes, the router can capture the info.<br>  <br>  Use the WiFi to find a nieghbors signal and use thiers to surf for pr0n. ^_^

I suggest buying everything separately on ebay. Start with a cheap amplifier/receiver(any brand will do, Yamaha preferably), then buy cheap main speakers(again any brand, Klipsch or bose should be the first choice if you can find a cheap enough set), and spend most of the budget on a Klipsch subwoofer. Despite what some may tell you, once you hear Klipsch you won't want anything else.

For a single line of service the 450 min plan in the US that runs $40 turns in $60 but it gives you unlimited Canadian and US calling. If you are just going there for a short trip and keep your US plan, calls are billed at 69 cents per minute, incoming and outgoing.

AbRfd29Haa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Most garage door openers these days use a radio signal at  315MHz, and a rolling code. Your LG phone can't generation a radio signal at that frequency, and you don't know the pseudorandom sequence used in the remote and receiver's rolling codes.<br>  <br>  If you needed to do this and wanted to spend some time, it could certainly be hacked. You could take apart a remove and run the switch to a transistor or relay circuit, which is sound-activated, then couple a microphone to the phone's speaker. When the phone rings, the circuitry would trigger the garage door opener.|`|wDOjkaYUaa	Well, if the Joker can blow up a building with a cell phone hidden in someone's abdominal cavity, than you should be able to open your garage door. The question remains however... how?|`|Y7qLedwkaa	No simply because you would need the InfaRed strip you see on remote controls. Then you would someone need to find a program. Not possible.
1HtTxOOQaa	USB's work without any fuss on a PS3. USB's are formatted in Fat32 so they should work with the PS3 with no problem. The problem arises when you connect an external drive which is any other format other than Fat32 (like NTFS or Mac OS journaled). <br>  <br>  Why not just plug he USB now and check if the PS3 is detecting it. Just transfer the saves and see if the USB is accepting it or not (99.9% it should accept).If it doesn't work, then just format it to Fat32. <br>  <br>  If you are running the USB on Windows, then it's probably Fat32 or NTFS(I don't think USB pen drives come in NTFS format...Fat32 is the only format they usually come in..but since you are stressing on converting..). Both are recognized by Windows so even if you format it to any other format, the comp will detect it with no problem and you can install or take any file you want. In fact I would recommend you to convert the thing to Fat32, cause many devices don't recognize NTFS format(like PS3) and one main drawback of NTFS is that you cannot put files into it on a different OS (like Mac). Fat32 is recognized as a standard format and so is the best option.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh ya, you don't have to create any folders. The PS3 takes care of it. After syncing with the PS3, you will see a few icons on the USB.. so don't get scared.. they are just admin files..delete them, but next time you put it into PS3, it will create them again so don't worry if you format the USB.<br>  <br>  Also, 1 GB is plenty space. The saves are hardly 150-300 KB.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	USB sticks shouldn't have to be formatted to the FAT 32.  Only external HDs with really big capacities.  I dunno if its a size issue, the fact that a USB cable is used for external HDs, or what.  Your USB stick only needs to be formatted to FAT 32 if the PS3 doesn't read it, but it definitely should read it.  Mine reads my 2 GB USB sticks without fuss.  You don't need to create folders on any USB storage media used.  The PS3 will do it automatically for you.  Sony kicks asss.<br> <br> I'm not sure if 1 GB will be enough space for the temporary transfer, though.
