Growing up, it was just my Mom and I and money to hire contractors or repairmen was not available.  Instead I began to look at things and figure out how to fix them.  That was 25 years ago when the information highway was still a single lane dirt road.  <br>  <br>  With today's information you can learn anything around the house in books, on line or on television.  However many of those sources aren't reliable as they don't deal with "common" houses such as I live in.  You know the landscaping shows that always show such huge yards and available space?  Yeah..I'd like em to do a show on my half acre lot surrounded by neighbors.  See what I mean?<br>  <br>  The human mind has an amazing capacity to obtain and retain knowledge.  In all my years I have met very few who cannot learn simple things.  If you want to learn how to do something, do your research and give it try.  Always keep safety in mind first, as second chances ARE important, and be smart.  If you mess it up?  No big deal.  Try again.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	No one is born a handy man, mechanic, school teacher, pilot, or any thing else. One has to work at it. Some have to do things because they want things to function properly and don't have the money to have it done for them. If they like fixing things, It comes easy. If they don't, then it becomes hard. The main thing is to take a stab at it and see if you can fix things. But you should be care full around electrical and gas stuff because if you don't know what you are doing, you could do more harm than good. There are all sorts of books out there to help you fix things right. Even with electrical and gas problems. Go to it!|`|XB5ECh7Haa	have a go youll be right get some experience good luck|`|ZA18KoC9aa	I'm not handy...but I have my father to rely on if something goes wrong!|`|a13EBBmUaa	ask alot of people the same question and you will get the same theme people like helping, also read books and magazines stay away from diy t.v. many employees at Lowe's etc are retired plumbers etc just ask questions and don't do any major repairs until you completely understand whats involved or you will get overwhelmed

x86mC8yyaa	Try hebes, lavender, spring-flowering heathers, cotton lavender (the kind with small yellow flowers, silver leaves, nothing to do with ordinary lavender) curry plant for its silver leaves, cistus, hypericum, tea roses, geraniums (the perennial kind, lots of different cultivars) small spireas, hellebores and thyme. All of these will give you colour, flowers, and will look good in Winter adding shape and structure to your bed, and are very easy to grow and manage.

Hard soil can also cause malformed potatoes. The reason a lot of farmed soil is dead is not so much sun killing the bacteria, but because constant and heavily tilled soil leaches faster and because the soil nutrients have been used up by the plants.  The potato plants can certainly use space, so go ahead and dig a trench.  Digging a potato trench in your garden doesn't exactly qualify as constant and heavy tilling.|`|x86mC8yyaa	Many organic gardeners agree it's best not to do any more digging than is necessary to control weeds and plant things, and with my back and advancing years, I find this a comforting theory. The idea is that too much unnecessary digging breaks up the soil structure and disturbs the worm tunnels, also it exposes more of the soil to the wind and weather, and this dries it out or washes away nutrients, depending on the weather. I would normally have dug the potato patch quite thoroughly the autumn before, to remove any weeds, and then cover it during the winter with a big sheet of weedproof membrane, which stops weeds growing and also protects the soil from the effects of rain leaching nutrients from the soil and causiing it to pan. When the cover comes off, the worms have been working away and the ground is lovely and easy for planting. I think you do need clean soil, and one of the reasons growing potatoes is so effective at clearing weedy ground is because you have to dig it several times, before planting and again repeatedly at harvesting, to get them all out. <br>  <br>  I find it's easier, and just as effective, to stretch out my measuring line and go along with a good-sized dibber or a small spade and make a hole for each potato, spacing them carefully, then add a handful of organic potato fertiliser to each hole, if you're using it, and just cover it up. Then, if you can mulch the rows when they start to grow, using compost or manure if available. The worms will take it down, and it's less work than the traditional 'earthing-up,' which in any case I've found is inclined to cover one row at the expense of exposing the next one. If you've not got any compost or manure, wood chippings from the garden processor or grass clippings are also good. <br>  If you don't actually want such huge potatoes, be careful not to rub off the shoots before you plant them. Fewer shoots mean larger potatoes and if you leave them on you'll get the same weight of crop but smaller spuds.|`|eO1o511daa	No just easier to find the spud in trenches without standing on them and crushing|`|13qQYRX0aa	the trench method is the best.<br>  dig the soil over and add organic material eg. compost or manure.<br>  make a small trench to plant the pototes and then cover.A good potato fertiliser and do not walk on the ground more than necessary.<br>  <br>  <br>  As potatoes need lots of water I do not earth the pototes up, this allows the plants more space to grow and more water for the plants.<br>  the farmers earth their crops up to make it easier for there machines to lift the crop.<br>  the question about a dibber.not a good idea as if the potato does not go to the bottom of the bibbed hole and an air space is left this can cause the potato to rot.
51349dda0808fd23457b7c0791a5e788aa	Many types of molds are completely harmless unless you happen to be allergic to them.  Many people do have some level of allergy to different types of molds.  However, there are some molds which are very dangerous.  These are generally not the kind that start sprouting on cheese ;).  Usually people get very freaked out by the "deadly black mold."  There are several types of molds that just happen to be black, so it's not always a major issue.<br>  <br>  In general, if not lethal (not that common when all's said and done), molds are at least a respiratory irritant.  There are ways to get rid of mold that come back (it usually just means you're not getting deep enough).  The site I cited has way more information on molds than should ever be found in a single location, so if you're truly curious or worried, it's worth checking out (it answered my question when I had a strange red mold crop up that I'd never seen before).|`|UFu0h8SKaa	mould is alive and grows and is gross, that's why we don't like it!

1giBkGvraa	Don't do anything permanent to a garden until you've seen all 4 seasons on the property.   You might just be having a super wet winter and everyone has the same problem!   that retention of water might be a blessing in the summer.<br>  <br>  Go around with a garden fork and make holes around 6 inches deep all over the area.   Then use a rake to pull away all the dead lawn at the root level.  Then throw over either gypsum or clay breaker (you can get it at the nursery).  <br>  <br>  this aerates the lawn and raises the ph in the soil to a better level that will allow the clay to be less of a nuisance over time.   If you're really serious about it, you need to do that once or twice a year.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just live with it.|`|Txipy3y7aa	Hi, I'd suggest gypsum to break up the clay, the water isn't draining because clay has alot of holding capacity, unlike sand. Dont returf because the clay will still be so far down and turf is expensive.

During spring thaw, it common to have soft ground and not a necessarily dertimental to grass growth.  As grass starts to grow, it will process some of the water present in root zone for growth.<br>  What are the air/soil temperatures in your area? Has grass started to grow?  In most areas, grass has not yet started to grow as soil temperature is not warm enough for turfgrass growth.  The soil may drain and clay soil, since it's below the 6" growth zone of turfgrass, may work to your benefit in the hot summer months when soil starts to become excessively dry.  <br>  Standing water, present when grass is actively growing, will kill grass.  You may want to wait and see if water is present during growing months.  You can always make minor drainage corrections yourself. Are there areas where it appears water is being trapped?  Is land slightly graded toward source of water?<br>  Sod is good fix for unusually soft topsoil BUT it will need to watered/moist during hot summer months and it won't survive more than 48 hours under standing water when growing.<br>  Gypsum is a good fix for relieving a saturated area but the fact clay soil is a foot or deeper you would have to till land to at least that depth to get the benefits of gypsum.  And if you have a drainage problem due to poor topography, which I suspect to be the case, it won't work.<br>  A reseed would be a good inexpensive fix.  When soil warms, the soft, moist soil provides and excellent base for new seed.  It sounds like you may have a good base of topsoil already.  You will also be able to see if during the summer months and rains this saturated condition remains.

Concrete is not hardly insulative at all, although it has great thermal mass.  That means concrete buildings are good at evening out the fluctuations in tempterature between daytimes and nighttimes (helping buildings stay cool), but in cold climates, concrete buildings are always cold.  Wood is a much easier material to insulate, and it has at least some insulation value itself.<br>  <br>  The United States is a very large country, with many different climates.  Where I live in the U.S. never has cyclones, tornadoes, or hurricanes.  It's also a somewhat cold climate where I live.  Our main hazard is forest fires.

This is important, as many potatoes bought from the actual grocery store will have chemicals on them, which will greatly affect your success rate when it comes to growing potatoes. Your local nursery should have seed potatoes in stock. If not, buying organic is the next best thing.<br>  Step2<br>  Place the seed potatoes in direct sunlight. You are looking to find a spot where the temperature will be between 65 and 75 degrees Farenheit. Place them "rose-end" up, meaning the side with the most eyes.<br>  Step3<br>  Leave potatoes in the sun for five to seven days or until the eyes begin to sprout.<br>  Step4<br>  Remove all but three eyes from your potato by washing gently.<br>  Step5<br>  Plant your potatoes in the ground. It is that simple.|`|x86mC8yyaa	I agree with everything Linda and Angel say, except that it's better to put them in a light, but COOL place. The object is to get them to produce short, strong,stubby shoots and if you give them too much warmth they will grow long thin shoots which are difficult to plant without breaking them. If you can, put them in egg boxes, one spud per section, with the 'rose end' pointing up to the light. This means the end where you can see the shoots are going to emerge from. If you're not sure which way up this is, just keep checking them until you see sprouts developing and turn them so these are pointing up. <br>  I'm glad you bought proper seed potatoes as you're much less likely to be importing diseases and viruses than if you just used potatoes from a shop, which have been produced differently for food and asre not certified virus-free.|`|ce415442d6934a8dae96b77ac250825faa	To chit a seed potato, you put it in a sunny spot that is warm enough so it won't  freeze...to get the eyes to sprout...earlier than it normally would.<br>  <br>  You are basically speeding up the growing process.  This is done to make the potatoes grow faster & to produce a crop of potatoes earlier. You should plant your potatoes when they sprout & have thick shoots. <br>  <br>  In this video, Monty at Berryfields discusses chitting, & says commercial growers don't chit their potatoes.  He also notes  that If the potatoes don't get enough light, the shoots will tend to get too long & you will have to be careful not to break off the tender shoots when you plant them:<br>  <a href="http://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/projects/potatoes-chitting/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/pro...</a><br>  <br>  In this video on chitting potatoes, it is pointed out that you should not put the potatoes in a place that gets too cold or frosty. The potatoes need some warmth, along with the sunlight. She also emphasizes that if the potatoes don't get enough sunlight, they'll get long & spindly trying to stretch toward the light:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2t4VrKeyqo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2t4VrKey...</a><br>  <br>  Garden Girl shows how she plants seed potatoes in a raised bed:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oslCBENbkGw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oslCBENbk...</a><br>  <br>  Besides growing potatoes in a raised bed, you can also plant them in a large deep container.<br>  Monty Don's step-by-step video guide on how to grow seed potatoes in a compost bag:<br>  <a href="http://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/projects/potatoes-compost-bag/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/pro...</a><br>  <br>  When you cut your potatoes, make sure the cuts have healed before planting.  Also, the eyes have to be facing up when you plant them.  This video shows how to plant potatoes in a trench:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i79tuAEbh1Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i79tuAEbh...</a>|`|AA11526639	Careful with answer number one, if you take the sprouting eyes off they will not grow.<br>  Basically leave them for a week in conservatory or window in an old egg tray with the eyes facing up. They eyes will become sprouts and you can then plant them.<br>  Irrespective of what was said elsewhere, just after the last real war, my father would chit them, and then cut the bottom of the potato off that did not have eyes on. He would plant the bit with eyes on and eat the other half both very successfully.<br>  A little hint, if you can get chicken manure to plant under them you will get really large potatoes !
d09ca82ef4d1521ac23c334df2e8eedeaa	Budget dictates everything but make sure you have some windows and a good door. If you can afford it some small skylight windows in the roof would go a long way in letting out excess heat and cool things down. What color are the roof shingles? Darker colors draw heat more than lighter colors and since you're in Texas it could make a big difference in how hot it gets inside. Does it have siding? If so make sure no nails come through on the inside, if they do board up the walls with boards or plywood to prevent possible injury.

3sU90myfaa	Carrots are grown from seed..they will not produce carrots from planting other ones..carrots are actually a biennial and will not produce seeds untill the second year..the carrots will not be fit to eat when you do this..the carrots grow then die off when time comes, then come back up the next growing season..the second year is when they produce seeds..it is cheaper and more efficient to simply buy seeds each year or you will waste valuble gardening space waiting for the carrots to go to thier second year..most feed stores sell seeds in bulk or by the cup..a A cup sells for about 40 cents and will have at least 4 or 5 thousand seeds for carrots seeing how they are so small...they will have A cuops..B cups..C cups and on...you pay by volume..each cup is actually small dippers sdimilar to measuring spoon sets..different sizes..the more seeds you want the larger "cup" you buy..You dip the size of cup(scoop or spoon actually)..in the can of seeds and pour in paper bags provided..them mark them of what they are and the size of scoop u used..buying seeds in the pack are way more expensive..You get 10 times the seeds for 1/4 of the xcost as buying in packages..Go to Your local feed and seed and buy in bulk..you wont waste all of this garden space trying to get your own|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Both.

TNwvuazEaa	If your home is heated by a forced hot air system, I would cut a hole in the ductwork running across the ceiling in your basement (the one that sends the hot air to the rooms in your home, not the return) and install an adjustable vent. When you're down in the basement, you can open the vent and have your regular heating system heat the basement. When you're not in the basement, just keep the vent closed. If you would rather buy a portable heater for whatever reason, go to the Home Depot and look at the ones they have. They have a chart posted showing the various uses for the various heaters they sell.

Plant food has three numbers, like 14-5-5<br>  <br>  The first number is Nitrogen, the second is Phosphorus and the third is Potassium.<br>  <br>  Nitrogen makes leaves dark green, Phosphorus helps the roots and flowering of the plant and Potassium gives the plant vigor and helps the leaves during stress (Like hot days).<br>  <br>  If any of these are lacking then the areas of the plant they are used in are most likely to be affected.<br>  <br>  If the edges of the leaves are yellowing or curling it's probably Magnesium, and to fix this you need to get some normal (non scented) Epsom Salt and sprinkle some into the plant container or the water.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)

yu9PHV4Maa	your pets should be of no issue with any properly used insecticide.  They are designed to be used around people an pets. If there is a water issue that is attracting the large outdoor roaches, you will be seeing different stages of development in the insects...if they have all been just the large adults, it may be just the warm weather that has them active and then finding their way inside.  Any general insecticide (orthos home defense, Mr Scotts, etc) used at the entry points of the structure and around the foundation of the structure should help in your situation. Boric acid can be used in your situation, but it is slow acting, unsightly and many times more toxic than any other insecticide you would buy or pay to have put down.|`|qlO6UZZyaa	To keep the mice out, use aluminum foil to plug up any holes in the walls, for instance, under sinks, where the pipes enter the wall, or any place where your apartment has openings.<br>  You can control the bugs by placing dry bay leaves around where ever you have seen them and under sinks, replace them every few months.

If it's the shortest route to the neighbor's meter, that's the route they will take.

What do you expect, to be able to make an appointment to have your meter read?  They have to read every meter on every house in the area so it would be nearly impossible to schedule meter readings at times to suit the customer.  And I'm sure he closes your gate again when he leaves.

nDO1RVwzaa	Well, since opening windows is usually not the answer one would seek, the only other answer other than a dehumidifier is to find and reduce the source of the moisture in the first place.  <br>  <br>  If the moisture is coming from the shower then use an exhaust fan while you're bathing.  If it is coming from cooking then do the same.  If it is seeping through the walls then seal them off with a water barrier and correct any drainage problems outside that is directing water toward your house.

L1G0fSP0aa	I'll try to draw you a verbal picture of what you need to do.  I'm guessing that the old medicine cabinet is history.<br>  <br>  The wire that supplied the old cabinet has either two or three wires.  One white, one black and if there is a third, it is either green or bare copper.  The white line is usually called common, the black hot and the bare or green ground.<br>  <br>  In order to accomplish what you want, the outlet needs to be in the circuit ahead of the light and switch.  Since this is in a bath it will need to be a Ground Fault Interrupt equipped outlet and switch.  Your circuit may already be GFI at the breaker if your house isn't too old.<br>  <br>  Picture this: Starting where the source wire currently comes out of the wall, the white wire to silver screw of outlet, black wire to gold screw of outlet.  bare wire to green screw of outlet.  Result, always hot outlet<br>  <br>  Next,attach a new white wire from silver screw of outlet to one screw of light base.  Attach a new black wire from other screw of light base to one screw of switch.  New black wire from other screw of switch to gold screw side of outlet. Result switched light.<br>  <br>  If you want the outlet and switch to be close to each other, you will need to mount a double box for them.  You will also need a single box for the light fixture.  In addition, if you have to splice wires where there is no outlet or switch, these splices should be inside covered boxes.|`|3sU90myfaa	You didn't mention if you want this switch to cut on/off the light as well or do you already have the light on a switch and just want the switch to cut the outlet you are adding off and on..if you want the same switch to cut the light off and on also the switch must be in the line before the already existing light..on the switch only the white wire will hook up to it..on one screw on the switch hook up the white wire to it..then on the other screw hook up the white wire from it to the light..the black wire should not hook up to the switch at all but simply bypass it and go on to the black side of the light..then white and black will go from the light on to the new receptacle..if the light is not to be switched with this switch..simply put the switch on the other side of the light from the main power source and wire as mentioned above..white wire from the light to the switch, then white to the receptacle..and the black again will simply pass by the switch and not hook directly up to it and go on and hook up to the receptacle|`|1ymL5LKlaa	You will probably need to remove the drywall in order to run the wiring and install needed electrical boxes for switch and outlet.

Soil generally has nutrients in it, so if you take out the soil, you still need the nutrients.  If you like this idea, look into hydroponics.  One method of growing cucumbers hydroponically uses bags of bark mulch with drip emitters watering them with nutrient-enriched water.

ZhN9hOaaaa	1. Two tons = 24,000 Btu's of cooling capacity.<br>  2. Your inside cooling coil that is mounted on your blower section or furnace should match the outside unit in btu's. So you put a 24,000 btu coil on the blower or furnace section.<br>  3. The blower of the indoor fan section or furnace needs to develope enough cfm's (cubic feet per minute) of air flow through the indoor coil<br>  to move enough air to match the cooling capacity of the 2 ton  (24,000) btu's of the above listed pieces.<br>  The old standard for years has been 400 cfm's per ton of cooling IE your indoor blower needs to develope 800 cfm's to be enough. <br>   Many indoor units come with a blower section in them that has a multi speed motor. It has lo/med/high leads and can be easely changed to the other speed by change the speed wire. The common wire is white and stays in place. the red wire is lo the black wire is high speed. Put it on high speed if it is icing and make sure you filter is clean.<br>  <br>  I suspect though that your home ( if it is 3000 sq feet) as you say, is a bit short on total cooling unit.<br>  <br>  One ton of cooling will take care of approximatly 500 to 800 sq ft of floor space, depending on exposures and insullation and so forth. A very rough figure would be 800 sq feet devided into 3000 sq feet = 3.65 tons of cooling equipment.<br>   <br>  Because your about to make a change for the good there , I'd have three well named HVAC companys give me a heat load analasysis of your home and recommend proper sizes. It should be free with a qoute if they want to sell you the equipment. Tell them your getting three estimates.    Even if you decide to change your indoor furnace or blower system alone you will know how much cooling capacity you need. <br>  Some people think they need to increase the heat capacity in the furnace or size of furnace to get a larger blower section. In some cases it is the only way to get a larger blower to match your sq footage but today furnaces have the multi speed fans and the Dealer or service company can answer this too. <br>  Good luck!<br>  Rangefinder
AA10725997	Do you have a tub that you do not use? That is pretty common in master baths.

scPKKZbJaa	A sunroom is a structure which is constructed onto the side of a house, usually, to allow enjoyment of the surrounding landscape while being sheltered from adverse weather conditions such as rain and wind. The concept is a popular one in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, it is normally described as a conservatory, although the room may not contain plants.<br>  <br>  The structure is often referred to as a patio room, solarium, conservatory, patio enclosure or Florida Room. It can be constructed of brick, breeze block, wood, glass or PVC. The brick or wood base makes up the main support for the PVC, referred to as the "knee wall", which is attached to the top of it. The glass panels are large and often clear instead of frosted. The roof may be of glass panels but is more usually of a plastic material which lets in sunlight.<br>  <br>  Newer rooms are typically constructed of aluminum framing with tempered glass as the primary structure. The room system is normally constructed of aluminum insulated panels or glass for the "high end" options. Skylights may be included in the insulated panels. The outside of the roof is normally constructed with a shingled roofing material.<br>  <br>  Whereas the majority of florida rooms or sunrooms of the past appeared to be disassociated with the home, newer public taste places a great deal of emphasis in blending the sunroom into the architecture of the home.<br>  <br>  Basically:<br>  <br>  They are the same thing, different words.<br>  <br>  Sunrooms are so famously constructed in the State Of Florida so many times that they eventually dubbed it: Florida Room|`|fpA0KaeQaa	well i live in jacksonville & my house just has brightly colored walls if thats wat ur asking. one wall is lime green, one is turquoise blue. it seems very floridish 2 me but im a girl so idk....LOL hope i helped!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  plz give me BEST ANSWER if i deserve it....i need the pts.

A florida room usually has tropical plants, some vintage covered pillows. Maybe some wicker or white painted furniture with a light airy feeling to it along with the ease that Florida kind of congures up when you think of tropical aligators and palms and maybe even some hanging lantern lighting for mood. There are lots of ideas and your own taste needs to come into it but mainly just think tropics and leisure and laid back. good luck.<br>  Miss Mary
yu9PHV4Maa	i was surprised to how well using a cheap garden sprayer (what's used to apply pesticides / fertilizer) works as a paint sprayer|`|d5a25fdc6fb2ab11185662388b3b3b75aa	If you dont own a sprayer you could use a paint pad. Use the brand shur-line. It can be purchased at home depot. The trick is to load the pad with a brush. Just put some paint right in the middle of the pad and it will even itself out. It really works great. Just take your time and stick with it until your completly done. Make sure you sand and prime any rust spots. Also use a quality paint oil based or  exterior latex. Good luck!

bvadSRo2aa	There are a few considerations for you. Are you talking about an existing building and you are replacing the HVAC unit?<br>  <br>  Here is some new information for you and a couple of links for the science to back it up. Buildings don't really need heating and "cooling", it should tell you there is a design problem but it couldn't be seen before to be qualified.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to advanced temperature imaging showing how buildings use energy to heat them in the winter. The amount of energy a building uses in the winter depends on the function of the insulated floors, walls and roof in conjunction with the type of heating system installed.  <a href="http://www.thermoguy.com/globalwarming-heatloss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thermoguy.com/globalwarming-h...</a> <br>  <br>  Buildings are designed to keep you cool in the summer because they are insulated for regional temperature extremes. The problem is we couldn't see the impact of solar radiation on exposed building exteriors so we reacted to symptoms. Here is a link to information that wasn't available before on the effects of solar radiation. Keep your exterior colors neutral and more reflective of solar radiation is required or your building will generate heat. <a href="http://www.thermoguy.com/globalwarming-heatgain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thermoguy.com/globalwarming-h...</a>|`|3W18HDxxaa	around $5,000 or more|`|AA10725997	5-7k|`|vNwNN1V7aa	Really ******* expensive.

2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	All suggestions above are worth a shot. First try all the machine cleanings, but the stink may not be with the machine.....per se. <br>  <br>   If you have a new machine, especially a front loader, they are having a heck of a time with mold growing behind the gasket on the door.  Of course the sales people deny this but you can read about all the consumer complaints.  Wipe that gasket off carefully after each wash. this is really more of a machine stink than a laundry stink.  <br>  <br>  However, new washers are having trouble with mold growing on the new type plastics inside.  No ammonia, vinegar or bleach is touching that.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://masterhandyman.com/columndetails.cfm?pubdate=20070609" rel="nofollow">http://masterhandyman.com/columndetails....</a>|`|DzRLYAAJaa	Wash all your clothes with a cup full of vinegar in every load. That will take the smells out completely. And it will make your washer smell better too. <br>  No, your clothes will not smell like vinegar when you do this.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Your wash machine could be dirty. Try putting baking soda in with a load of whites. With another white load, use bleach. That should purge any mold that may be lurking in your machine.|`|AA11352641	Run a cup or two of bleach thru the washer on the whites cycle to kill any mildew that may be there. Be sure you are taking the clothes out of the washer as soon as the cycle is done and that they are drying completely in the dryer.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Add 1/2 cup of ammonia to your laundry when you use the washer.  This will get rid of the smell that are in your clothes.  Are you leaving your laundry in the washer for a day or two before you toss them into the dryer?  If you are doing this it will cause your clothes to have an unpleasant odor.  Toss in the dryer when the wash cycle is done and don't let them set.  Good Luck!!!!!
qwmggyAPaa	You can just put the dirt over it. The grass will help hold some of the soil in place. However, 5 inches of soil on top of the grass will probably kill the grass before the grass has a chance to grow up through the soil.|`|Yuvcy02uaa	dig 2ft along the foundation and 1ft out.

Lots of crack?? Caulk first then skim coat 1/8 or 1/4 inch thick of concrete or mortar  repair kit.(qiuckrete) Stone yard will tell you how much stone you need, just give the measurements. slope dirt away from house as well.|`|1enIWBGnaa	You need to bury some 'drainage pipes' to get the water away from the side of the house.  Adding dirt will not get rid of the problem.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	The best drainage solution is to put a french drain in. A french drain is a perforated pipe in a trench filled with pea gravel. That will move the water to where it needs to drain instead of it draining in your basement. You can put topsoil over your grass, but 5 inches in one time is too much. Apply the topsoil in 2 inch increments and wait for the grass to grow through, then apply 2 more inches until you get to the desired level.|`|WZdEdgxwaa	To answer very basically yes it's fine to put new dirt over the grass.You don't go into much detail as to what the surrounding drainage is like.There are also additional things to do such as french drains and such,look at the root cause.Rather than bore you,here's some excellent advice from people that know.This is a very informative site to help you.<br>  <br>  My Best

Depending what state your in, you probably need to change your dirt and transfer your plants. Careful were you get your dirt from, it would be best to buy it and enrich it with nutrients and mix it well prior to transplanting your plants. Be sure not to remove the soil from the roots. You plants are going to stress but spray them and careful with the direct sun light for about a week,

They're cheap and effective.<br>  You get it at hardware stores.<br>  <br>  Other than that, no you need a dehumidifier, or move state.|`|VgXKFHypaa	You could put a small box fan in the window and draw the inside air out.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	Refrigerant air conditioners are dehumidifiers. If you have a central unit, it will dehumidify the house quicker.|`|ZS2Jo9ZKaa	Some ducted air conditioners can also de humidify the air (such as Daikin ducted air conditioners).<br>  <br>  Then you get a de-humidifier plus an air conditioner!|`|gwTLvop6aa	go buy a dehumidifier

My dad has worked as a painter nearly his whole life so I know a thing or two about color. Dark colors tend to make a room look real small. So if you're working with a tight area I suggest you use brown on the smallest wall in the room and cream on the others.. As far as furniture and window treatments I think a nice sage green would look great. By the way, when you're picking out paint any color you choose will turn out a shade darker when you apply it to the walls. So I always pick a shade lighter to get the shade I want. Hope this helped and your room should turn out beautiful!|`|7d76f8Fgaa	For paint, check out "Outback" by Behr at The Home Depot.  It might be discontinued, but I am sure they can still whip up a batch for you.  It is a very creamy, sagey green.

GyB5Yfgmaa	Of course it is bad because most plants don't like wet feet but you can fix that by buying a drill and drill a hole at the bottom yourself.|`|gFHTcIc8aa	If you water daily and consistently, yes.  Excess water will become trapped leading to the oversaturation of roots.  Oversaturated roots will eventually break down and dissolve leading to death of plant.|`|944iJNAdaa	Plants don't generally grow well in pots without drainage holes, although I've kept them going a year or two by very careful watering.  Eventually salts build up in the soil, or else rot develops, and the plant suffers (or dies).<br>  <br>  I've sometimes used these pretty pots with another smaller pot that does have drain holes inside.  As long as water doesn't accumulate in the bottom, that works.<br>  <br>  p.s.  Rocks in the bottom of a pot don't improve drainage, the spaces quickly fill up with water, roots grow there anyway, and the roots still rot.  This idea of putting rocks in the bottom is an old wives tale, plus the rocks only take up space that would be better to have potting soil in it.|`|Yuvcy02uaa	they will not. Drill holes.....don't know how? DO-IT-YOURSELF-NETWORK will show you how. Buy the bottom saucer that matches the pot. Hardwood floors at home? Buy the new pot saucer pads so you don't scratch your floor. Have fun!|`|6n63DKYWaa	you need to put the plastic pot with the holes  into the pretty pot there needs to be enough room around the edge for air to move and the water to evaporate out|`|1enIWBGnaa	Place a layer of rocks in the bottom, a layer of moss, dirt and the plant or make your own drainage holes.|`|qwmggyAPaa	Most plants need some sort of drainage in order to keep the roots out of standing water.  Try putting an inch or so of small rocks, pebbles, or pot shards in the bottom of the pots before adding soil. The excess water will drain through the soil, down into the rocks and the roots will remain mostly out of the water in the bottom. <br>  The soil will "wick" the water out of the bottom of the pot as needed.<br>  To know when it's time to water your plant again, poke your finger into the soil. If it's dry about 1 inch down into the soil, it probably needs a little water- just not too much.<br>  Hope this helps.
dl1yuCoFaa	Yes, you can dig it up and move the bulb. However, if it didn't come up last year, the bulb most likely has rotted. Dig down a bit and see if you can locate the bulb. If it is still there and alive, carefully remove it and plant it in another location. If the bulb is soft and spongy it is most likely rotten. Be careful where you plant elephant ears. Over the years, they spread like mad, taking over other areas of your garden.|`|qwmggyAPaa	Yes, you certainly can, if the bulb is not dry and shriveled.<br>  Select a spot that gets good drainage so that the bulb will never remain in standing water or saturated soil for more than a day. Otherwise, the bulb will rot.<br>  Loosen the soil about 8 inches on either side of the bulb and loosen it about 6 inches deeper than the bulb. Scoop out the soil and place the bulb roots down, into the hole. The top of the bulb should be level with or just barely above the surface of the soil. <br>  <br>  With your hands, press down the soil around the bulb. This will help eliminate air pockets and ensure that the bulb is snug in the ground.<br>  <br>  Water gently.  Keep the soil barely damp until new growth begins.<br>  Careful not to over water.            Hope this helps !
bc2c20578f51c5d8576556ddbba6f0a2aa	you need to till, mix in compost, top soil and some sand when it's very well tilled. <br>  oh make sure to remove all the grass and weeds before you mix in the good stuff.<br>  treat with weed block after to prevent new growth.|`|Yuvcy02uaa	Don't know the general  size where you want to plant but this should help. If your planting every 2-4 ft, you need to take that soil out say 3x3x3ft.  I lived in colorado and this type of digging worked great. mix new soil in a barrel. screened topsoil, peat-moss and organic matter(compost) Equal parts will be find. Double digging the whole depth even more will get those roots to grow and have room and become established.<br>  This is for perennials. Annuals don't need that much depth. To much work for a plant or flower that won't come back. Search on the web for your states cooperative extension program to find out which plants do well in clay soil.

Then they simply plant these rooted cuttings.<br>  <br>  The fact that it has been possible to selectively culture grapevines until the grapes have no seeds is yet another proof that evolution works!  In this case, survival of the fittest applies to the vines that had fewer and few seeds, until a point was reached when the grapes had no seeds at all.  This "selected evolution" has worked for farm animals, dogs, cats, flowers, trees, and just about everything we have around us today.  Creationists, go eat your hat.|`|4569b23a3611fb03850cd42c9f2cb6baaa	Seedless grapes are hybrids and are grafted or cuttings taken only.<br>  Below explains it quite simply on How Stuff works<br>  How can there be seedless grapes? How can they reproduce?<br>  It turns out that most fruits today do not come from seeds. They come from cuttings instead. <br>  Seedless grapes actually do contain seeds at some point. But a genetic error prevents the seeds from forming hard outer coats like normal seeds do.<br>  A piece of a vine or branch is cut off, dipped in rooting hormone and then placed in moist dirt so that roots and leaves form. Because they come from cuttings, new grapevines are essentially clones of the vine they were cut from. <br>  <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/fruits/question349.htm" rel="nofollow">http://science.howstuffworks.com/fruits/...</a> <br>  I live in Missouri wine country.|`|yukTCHVSaa	There are seeds they're just really small so you don't taste them.|`|djlA8Wpdaa	ive always wondered that myself....|`|uElQecMoaa	hehe I asked my boyfriend this question just yesterday! I couldn't find the article I found yesterday, but this comes close:<br>  <br>  "Seedless grapes are a special bunch.<br>  <br>  All plants -- including grapes -- grow from seeds. But some people prefer to munch on sweet, juicy grapes without biting on seeds too. So, grape breeders (those are people who develop different kinds of grapes) use their plant smarts to grow the seedless varieties.<br>  <br>  Grape breeders create new seedless plants by placing the pollen of a seedless grape onto the flowers of a grape variety that has seeds. They then cut open and inspect the fruit of every single plant that grows from this match. The breeders are looking for seeds -- some plants will have seeds in their fruit and others won't.<br>  <br>  When they find a plant that has no seeds, or maybe just has very tiny traces of seeds that you wouldn't be able to taste, the grape breeders use it to make more seedless plants. One way is to cut off small pieces of the seedless plant's vine and place it in special growing conditions in a greenhouse. Eventually, the pieces of vine will grow roots and become new, individual plants. This technique is called propagation.<br>  <br>  Or, the breeders can graft, or attach, a piece of the seedless grape variety onto a healthy vine base, called a rootstock. Think of it like this: When someone cuts their hand, a doctor sews the cut together, and the two pieces heal as one. The grafted vines grow together the same way. And, the grape variety attached to the rootstock keeps producing delicious seedless grapes."|`|09db70825677bbcf722475d2959af94eaa	They grow seedless grapes by mutating the seed chromosome.  They can do this by reproducing until the get the phenotype they want or by going to the molecular level and change the DNA.

vl6OtBfWaa	We usually use white shoe polish to hide the brown material visible from damage in ceiling tiles.  You could go through the trouble of trying to fill with a filler material but the texture will never match and it can get messy.  Just use either white shoe polish or spackle that comes from Home depot in a bottle with a foam applicator pad at the end, water clean up and white color makes easy repairs|`|6GkIUoM6aa	armstrong and usg both make the tiles and touch up paint. it is available at most professional supply houses, not home depot or lowes.
L1G0fSP0aa	Actually, raw wood is a fine product for the home.  As long as the wood was properly dried prior to being made into furniture, nothing need to be done to it.  It will develop a patina as it is used and ages.  For centuries, wood furniture was unfinished and served quite well.<br>  <br>  I'd be more concerned with what you bought as a sealer.  Once applied and allowed to dry, there shouldn't be any odor.  Once the solvents out gas and the finish is hard, there shouldn't be any smell.  Did you follow the instructions carefully when applying the sealer?|`|3W18HDxxaa	if the ends were sealed at the factory don,t worry about it, <br>  or use polyurethane to seal it,|`|cJ7Pd0Ioaa	if you are not getting the furniture treated and you are scared that even with all the care... something might spill.. the best thing is to cover that furniture with transparent plastic.. i wud be good as transparent plastic will not hide the design or the wood and you and the guests would still be able to see the furniture make.. on the other hand.. even if something is spilled you can wipe it from the plastic instead of the wood and save ur furniture from damage..<br>  <br>  as for the smell.. get some nice wood polish or bees wax or consult a professional on what to do with this.. you might have applied the gloss a bit too much to get this result.. try to wipe furniture with damp.. i mean almost dry cloth. if you prefer to see what happens.. dont go for wet cloth as you know it can be a disaster
L1G0fSP0aa	Different parts of your furniture were manufactured by different companies.  Formaldehyde is a product used in manufacturing particle and fiber board that is probably what you are calling "new stuff" smell.  It sounds like the drawer parts were made of materials with an especially high level of formaldehyde.  If after 4 months the odor is still causing you problems, it is unlikely to go away.  It should have been gone by now if it were of acceptable levels.<br>  <br>  Take at least one of the drawers back to the place where you bought it and complain.

This is done so that the one tree will draw nutrients from the other tree in order for the first tree to grow.   This can be done with a similar tree or a completely different tree.  The process works the same for each case.<br>  <br>  The only way I have ever seen it done is to take a branch or limb that is thought to still be alive and cut into another tree to place that limb or branch.  Shove the branch into the other tree into the cut you made and tie them together very tightly.  After a period of time, the branch or limb will begin to grow.  The trees will grow simultaneously as if they were one tree.|`|944iJNAdaa	Grafting means you cut the top off of one tree, and cut the root off another, and splice the two of them together to grow a new tree.  This is a way of fusing a really good growing rootstock with a really high producing top part, thus making a better producing tree than nature provided.  I'm sure the article mentioned above tells this in much better detail.
xTioPxaVaa	The main components of a pro pedalboard are:<br>  <br>   - The interface.  (That is, the inputs and outputs)<br>   - The power supply(s) for the effects<br>   - The pedals themselves<br>   - The interconnects between the pedals.<br>  <br>  Before you build anything, put all of your effects on the floor in front of you and make sure you can reach everything you want.  Almost all pedals have signal flow that goes from right (input) to left (output), so you'll want to put your effects in the order that you're going to chain them together.  Make sure that you leave enough space between effects so that you can pull the plugs and remove it if you need to.<br>  <br>  Once you've got this laid out, measure a rectangle around the whole thing, and that's going to be the dimensions of the wood base.  You might want to make it a little bigger in case you want to add add something else later.<br>  <br>  After that, attach everything to the board.  If you're not traveling with it, use a good 3M industrial grade Velcro to attach everything.<br>  <br>  Of course, that's a very high level view of the assembly process, but this should get you started.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	Kevin, regardless of the plastic in the crawl space you have a vapor/moisture barrier issue.  You need to use the foam underlayment that is sold for engineered/laminate/floating floors and personally & professionally I barr no expense on this in my installations.  The best grade underlayment provides the barrier you need as well as it'll make the floors feel and sound better.  Whom ever instructed you to use a paper underlayment, especially in you region of the country and installation parameters should buy your replacement floor where it went bad.<br>  <br>  Take it from this Florida boy who's installed an awful lot of this flooring in same/similar environments and circumstances and heed my advice on the underlayment.  Also, 1/2" gap is far too much and uneccessary, even with a plywood backed laminate.  1/4" at each end is plenty. . . 1/2" won't cover with base shoe if you're leaving the baseboard in place with this install; you'll have to use quarter round and that looks like hell and is a dirt/dust magnet.  Run the 1/4" expansion gap and final out the base with what's called base shoe molding, not only is it less money, but it'll be a much more aesthetically pleasing feature to this trim.<br>  <br>  If you need some additional tips and help achieving a "professional" looking installation feel free to contact me with any questions on this project.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.us" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.us</a> or .com|`|T6d1NOwMaa	Leave 1/2" gap around the perimeter to allow for expansion.

x86mC8yyaa	The last 2 summers in the UK were very poor for blackberries. I don't grow them but the wild ones here didn't ripen at all until quite late in September and were not as sweet as usual, because of the wet summer and lack of sunshine, and I noticed several bushes with no berries developing at all. I think poor pollination may have been involved with the wild ones and with your Mum's blackberries, as there were fewer insects around in the cool wet early summertime,  The vigorous growth of the branches was probably due to them having so much rain. I'd prune them quite hard, and feed them well, and just hope for some lovely SUN this year!|`|VmCncRmoaa	This can be a symptom of exhausted reserves in the plant's roots, marginal pollinator populations, or infection with a virus such as Raspberry bushy dwarf virus. Even a small change in conditions, such as a rainy day or a day too hot for bees to work after early morning, can reduce the number of bee visits to the flower, thus reducing the quality of the fruit.

944iJNAdaa	A bean plant without light might outgrow one with light for a tiny bit, because it would still be desperately seeking light, and not think it's grown tall enough to get it yet.  But a plant without light doesn't have any more energy than was contained in the seed, and until leaves are grown and they can receive light, the plant doesn't have the ability to make more energy (even if it's getting fertilizer and water).  Without light, all plants are doomed to die, even though their seeds get them started.

Home Depot Tool Rentals have various size scaffoldoing for rent as so do other rental yards; two sections will get you up to 12' and three walk boards will give you one comfortable staging platform at 6' and two for the top working deck.  Be sure to get the casters (wheels) as not only will it provide you with an additional 6" of height, but they will prevent any damage to your floor.<br>  <br>  Also, go into the electrical department of Lowes or HD and purchase what's called a "Safety Brace" electrical box.  There is both new construction and remodel versions that securely fasten between the ceiling joists and are specifically designed for heavy lighting fixtures and ceiling fan installations.  They cost under $20 and are very easy to install.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.us" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.us</a> or .com|`|GsSRY7quaa	see if you can rent a scaffold for the day to change your light|`|L1G0fSP0aa	Obviously you need to get up to the ceiling.  What you use will be determined by the area available.  You might be able to rent a folding ladder at one of the home supply stores.  20 feet is quite a reach.  If you can find a reasonable solution to the height problem, there shouldn't be too much trouble changing out the light.<br>  <br>  Getting there is the problem.  Once there, the fix is relatively simple.|`|AHZ7fgQHaa	I have the exact same issue in my home, but it is 18ft high. You need to get up there for changing lights, removing cobwebs, and repainting the ceiling someday. What I did is built a freestanding ladder, it's like an A-frame step ladder but I made it 12ft high. It is a little risky but works well for ceiling access. In your case I would make it 14 or 15ft tall. I used as thin of wood as I could trust to hold my weight. This keeps it fairly lightweight for getting it in an out of the house and garage.|`|SPIKxQ4raa	trellis ladder
vl6OtBfWaa	I am a  general contractor in residential renovations and I have seen this happen I even did it myself the first time I built a tiled shower enclosure.<br>  The main problem comes from not having enough slope to properly drain water from the floor.  Also it sounds like you might have a drain grill that is higher than the surrounding tile and perhaps even a drain pipe that is too small or not sloped enough to take away the water.<br>  <br>  I say this because you mentioned even when the water is running in the shower it fills up halfway.  If the drain was adequate the water should drain quickly once the level rises above the drain grill.<br>  <br>  There is no easy solution for this the time I incorrectly sloped the floor I was forced to remove the tile and the underlayment and start again.<br>  <br>  Standing water anywhere is a bad idea a tile floor can take more water but eventually there will be drawbacks to this not to mention standing in dirty or cold water.<br>  <br>  Check my profile and email me if you want a specific fix.|`|qs9QHvy9aa	Theres a few reasons why this is bad.  The first, and most obvious, is the potential for mold growth.  But second, you mention that its only like this for a few hours.  Water doesn't evaporate that quickly, so if its going away, I'd worry about how good of a seal your grout is giving you.  That waters going somewhere, I'd want to know where.|`|576ffa89e847ec1c8ed4cd65ee6f6dbcaa	Both Tim and Sean are correct. The drain should be the lowest point - if I was you I'd try and get the contractor to redo the floor! Good Luck.|`|8apA3Rffaa	You say the drain works fine but then you say it ( the floor) fills up 1/2 the shower.  Then drain can t be fine the water would be flush with the drain and then drain out slowly by going down into the mud shower floor and thru the weep holes in the base of the drain..The tile must be flush wi the top of the drain.  I have a sneaky suspicion  that you have mud or cement in your drain from the contractor or debris from demo ,  possible hair and debris if it wasn t a new drain . As Casey said the proper pitch to the drain is so important.. This pitch  should be a MINIMUM of 1/4" per foot .  This figuring from the furthest point in the shower to the drain.. This furthest point is most often a corner of the shower unit..

Plants take in oxygen through their leaves and with the water they absorb from the soil.  Fertilizer protects parts of the plant only in the sense that it helps the plant grow healthy and stronger.  As far as plants in the wild doing well without fertilizer, nature provides constant fertilizer in the form of natural minerals and composting (decomposing) plant materials.

It's there somewhere.|`|bvadSRo2aa	You sound like you have a connection problem and if you aren't qualified, get an electrician. That way if there is a problem, you have a professional to be responsible for the job.<br>  <br>  If the outlets are spread across the walls, they are likely connected and a loose connection can be on the plug or the wire nut connector.

Even as a trained professional, I may put on a pair of gloves to avoid shocks or short circuits.
