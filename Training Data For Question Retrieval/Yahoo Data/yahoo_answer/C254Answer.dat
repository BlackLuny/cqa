qsuYKa3naa	Yup and once I ran out of shampoo and had to use my Dove soap as shampoo, yucky|`|xxSGhywoaa	I do.  I use suave so it doesn't do that.  I've even washed my body with laundry soap.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	a lot of people do it.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes|`|QMAqzpKEaa	Yes, I do sometimes or if I go somewhere and there is no soap I use shampoo.  I use conditioner to shave my legs too. It makes my legs really soft and it it better than that shaving form rubbish.  I use moisturiser on wet body because the body retains the moisture and smell of the moisturiser.   My skin stays soft and nice this way.  It is a nice idea to wash conditioner out of your hair with lukewarm water too because some conditioner stays in and makes your hair extra silky.|`|jazKtgENaa	Luckily I've never ran out of body wash but If I ever do I would us shampoo.|`|Jucak0HLaa	Ha,sometimes.But usually I run out of shampoo first.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	that would dry my hair out so bad if i did the reverse. no, i make sure i never run out.

HAhm1TUoaa	Exactly. What if somebody wanted to hide in the fridge? And they were scared of the dark?|`|shvhgzXeaa	Ask your avatar Charlie|`|RP5NnxgUaa	You can't see inside it if it had no light. The light turns off when you shut the door.|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	Its the law of the fridge..|`|4gjAxw4saa	It's a bit like an X-ray Charlie.|`|eLFrlCmuaa	I've always wondered that to!!|`|AA10140520	Does anyone "live" in your fridge?!|`|8uIfskigaa	haha & a fridge that automatically passes you your lager or milk when you open the door :)|`|4EZcG3YSaa	how do you know its not on when you shut the door? ha ha got ya on that one didnt I? tee hee|`|OXleDYVQaa	Um, I think it's so I can pull up a chair, snack and read at the same time. I could be wrong though?    Dallas|`|9ADVLFOnaa	How else am I going to see what you have to offer ;)|`|2hV2fmZEaa	your right. that makes no sense. lol|`|omAtDbSKaa	cus u dnt need 2 see inside it wen its shut lol|`|vKRg8djCaa	yea|`|lUYeHIWpaa	Hahahahahaha!|`|j6MSv5Tkaa	for you to see .    and no it's supposed to be off cause some foods are sensitive to light.  for instance, milk can lose b2 vitamins or something like that when it's under direct light for too long.|`|h6wDmUMWaa	no, the light comes on when the fridge door is closed! c'mon ur a fridge u should know!|`|j4SsGFjBaa	Please never reproduce :)|`|NQQaoG8Oaa	theres no light inside your head then lol|`|nwYZWwDHaa	so u can see when u open it... but good point|`|8n3NvYQwaa	No the whole idea being that is to let the fresh vegies stay fresh and get their beauty sleep and they could not do that if they had to stay awak...|`|pz1OdJoPaa	well unless youre planning on climbing inside the fridge and shutting the door no!|`|UoDtGtiLaa	because whenever someone opens your door Mr Fridge, you get an idea, and so your light turns on :)|`|H1KVuGG2aa	To see where to get the cheese at 2 o'clock in the morning|`|K3jcdkveaa	so it doesn't burn out. to bad you are one.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	It comes on so every body can se how greedy we are, dead giveaway that light! so it makes a good deterrent! im sure the food would appreciate some light too, imagine being closed in the dark like that bad enough being cold brrrrrrrrrr!|`|rXq7ssXBaa	Because How would you like it if you were looking for some oj, reached behind the milk, knocked over the milk onto the floor, spilled the milk, and then got your oj?    I think the real question here is,    Which way would you rather get your oj?|`|AA11809775	Because the light is for the people opening the fridge, not the fridge itself.  :P  hah|`|AaXl5YYkaa	yes you are so right. i need to think more like you and less like refrigerator manufacturers|`|jCFWPWpUaa	It gives the little invisible man inside a job to do.

You don't need a light on when it is shut because your not looking inside.|`|qWqg7vFJaa	More importantly ....How does the wee man know you are about to open the fridge..He has the light on ready for you..Pretty cool really...hehe|`|cE20wh1laa	you're supposed to carry a torch for that charlie, you'd waste the light bulb too quickly in the fridge, if it worked that way ;)|`|GlP7KECoaa	no?|`|AAwe5WbVaa	so if you open it when its dark you wont spill milk all over you:)|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	Theres a pressure switch on the crease of the door.    and, agreed. Some foods are scared of the dark. :)|`|0P5qBxiZaa	why don't you answer that   Your the fridge|`|LsDdJlDgaa	so,whats do you think....................

My ring cost $220, and it was a ring we chose together.   The world might say diamonds are a girls best friend, but for me, its my fiancee.   I barely wear any jewelery, and the ring we chose was a flat band, very subtle.None of this rock-the-size-of-a-marble sh*t.   Women need to get over it.   It's not about the ring.   It's about the relationship.|`|HdbVkGQdaa	I think its a little bit of both. Your asking someone to spend there entire life with you. A ring is a symbol of a mans love for a women. I think the bigger the better if he can afford it.

ikMOb6gcaa	It's the mystique of being Hef, I think, that makes them (I believe) honestly want to sleep with him.  Why would the parents care . . . if the girls want to do that, it reflects on how they were brought up to a point, and if they were brought up like that then the parents are probably proud of them.    Opinion as a civilized man:  He needs to grow up.    Opinion as a barbarian:  Good for you, pops!|`|9r1zw0evaa	t3h c00k13z?|`|8e8f00fc5b9e9edb3247392086ec523faa	keep wondering than|`|IYF4xSTdaa	I say to each his own..I don't like him but I really don't have to..a lot of people would love to be him and live his life,have his money and women..he is living what some men call heaven.good for him..the parents  I think look at the money and fame..I could be wrong..
411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	Yes,I have, but hubby didn't want that!   We were going someplace and this ( um,uh, insert negative slang- for- a -homosexual remark here) pats my hubby "there," and Eric , not liking some dude touching him there, had said really loudly: "Harder,next time, big boy!"   The guy wasn't " out of the closet" yet and it really embarrassed him. Needless to say,the guy never did it again!   Where we come from, if a gay man touches another mans privates, it constitutes rape or innapropriate handling.  Gay men really aren't well tolerated where I used to live.  I don't have a problem with gay people, but when they place their hands where they don't belong,THEN I gotta problem with them.|`|RezEkwMOaa	no .  you got your *** felt up by a bouncer !  hahahaha|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Yes...at my own request.
Ioc0owmfaa	Unfortunately, there are people who judge others by their appearance, no matter how much we hate it.    Especially young people like at your school, but adults do too sometimes.    You know what, just ignore those people. You know who you are and you have your own life.    You are relevant only to people who are relevant to you. You can't control anything that is outside your influence.    Cheer up. Go and skate and don't even bother whether they know or not that you can skate!    You go girl!|`|MaPPHhbqaa	well no I don't.   but the folks at your school need to butt out|`|hYqRhQxPaa	don't worry about  psychopaths/jerk...do whatever you like.don't listen to them  Edit  yes honey they are jerk  if they behave like  morons.  they just want to prove themselves superior and want to hide their weakness|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Wow, can you say jerks? No, I don't judge. I mean everyone has a thought about someone when they see them but then you figure, they may look like that but they could have a wonderful career or they could be doing something great with their lifes. I think it's best to not to judge.|`|vZZU2Z4xaa	people shouldnt judge. its stupid and wrong. i bet if someone judged the person who said that to you, they would cry. stupid judgers people >.|`|djhCah5Maa	Kids are stupid at that age.

Be true to yourself.

They should've at least gotten to know you first.    I don't really judge people by appearance.  I take the time to observe them in their activity in class or school and I also try to get to know them a little bit.    VIVA LA RAZA!
i210xqkgaa	not really, but he does often leave joker cards behind after what he does. there is also all that quote that has become so popular "why so serious?"|`|dfjIBHe3aa	There was a joker comic book at one point and of course it had a title.  His symbol has always been the joker card which was originally drawn by Jerry Robinson.  As far as a formal logo like Batman's, nothing has stood the test of time.

KEk728Gsaa	Personally, the thought of purchasing anything by Slipknot makes me wanna puke.|`|tlj3c50Haa	I've only heard the two singles (or the first two if there are more) from it, and based on that I'm not going to buy it. However if one of my friends had it I'd give it a listen, I might even download it (Note I mean download it to hear it so I'm not wasting money). It's not really fair to judge it on two songs.|`|SoF1F4uJaa	I own the album, I bought it from a music store when it came out. It's not bad, but I expected more from them. A few heavy numbers, some experimental s**t in there, a ballad or two and some solid rock tracks. It's not a flawless album by any stretch of the imagination, but you could do worse.    Best tracks:    Gematria (The Killing Name)  Psychosocial  Dead Memories  The Butcher's Hook  Wherein Lies Continue  All Hope Is Gone
AA12381582	Yes they come with the glasses, they give them to you when you have your ticket torn in half before going into the actual theater room.  It costs two dollars more for 3d to cover the cost because it is a little more expesive to to 3d.  Also they do wash the glasses between shows, at least I see them do it a the theaters I've gone to.  They put them on a rack and run them through the dish washer.|`|AW10aKbiaa	ew. you do know they never wash those after they are done with the 1st show
qlQCL4fMaa	Well you can watch it on the internet and then record it with hypercam(a desktop recorder) get the regester one...       I hope this help...

a1Ngi39Xaa	No.  With few exceptions...    My parents listened to it when I was young so I rebelled of course and loved my rock and roll.  I do like a lot of Southern Rock though.    Most of the new stuff is just trashy or tacky sounding to me.  The female singers sound like cats with their tails caught in a door.  I have my own cats!    But I do like Johnny Cash and Randy Travis.  Their music is written, played and sung from the heart.  RIP Johnny.  I also listen to bluegrass sometimes and I like country gospel music.  I also like a little Alan Jackson - the song he wrote about 9/11 is amazing.  I like how Ricky Skaggs can play the mandolin as well.|`|FMwckpMbaa	I listen to Folk :)|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I listen to some of it. Only Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Alan Jackson, and Keith Urban, though.|`|w5KFkyGRaa	only on the mornings that i ride the school bus the driver listens to country so so does the rest of the bus.  and I'm not fond of it but it is better than rap in my opinion.|`|mggll8dRaa	I'm Ok with it, but don't listen too much...!!|`|snjdyvlmaa	Yes, I do.    I enjoy it when I am sad or if I am in the mood for it.|`|5NsgLFPRaa	If you consider Johnny Cash and Garth Brooks country musicians    I guess I technically do   I don't consider Johnny Cash country though...  more like a Classical|`|jAAWM3Kyaa	Nope, it sucks|`|qsuYKa3naa	I like it because it tells a story and is easy to understand.|`|ocrnjukoaa	***** NO!!!!!!!!!|`|nvo1zwrSaa	Nope, the closest I get to country music is my Taylor Swift :)  And I only like 2 songs haha!    I don't HATE it, its just not my cup of tea! I'm not the only one...|`|jcVJM8FNaa	eh not rele|`|67GoFqKDaa	Yep but mostly classic country l enjoy listening to|`|pVJJ9R85aa	god no, well atleast not new country, but johnny cash is good|`|fSRqz7aYaa	I HATE country.|`|mRZWtPLcaa	Yea , I listen to real country music, up here its called mountain music.|`|jpH4IjWnaa	Hell no, I HATE country!|`|AA12361841	I luv country music. Rhinestone cowboy is old old old school.

But not that often besides she doesn't sing real country music. It's more like country/pop....|`|siHzYvdsaa	I listen to country but not so much that type of country there are many different types of country music like classic, alt, new, so on. I listen to mainly Texas Country Music its a little like rock mixed with country. You should check it out pretty good stuff. Here are a few artist Cross Canadian Ragweed, Pat Green, Casey Donahew Band, Eli Young Band, Robert Earl Keen, and Jason Boland.|`|9qKwTGeOaa	Ick.|`|e3cNU8Spaa	Puh-lease.

Well I'm sorry that's my 4th favorite but my 1st is TWILIGHT!|`|EK4NGPJMaa	I like all movies basically, I really like Twilight. I know what you all are going to say, Oh my god, another Edward fan! No, I like Jacob, Edward is ugly and needs anger management. I like Twilight because to me, in an odd way it describes the trouble that all of us go through in life. It is a romance, chick flick. It also teaches that everyone has flaws, Edward is a "gorgeous" goddess (as Bella thinks) and he is smart and "everything a girl could want", except for being a vampire. Mike is a nice, smart...jock. That is obsessive, of course. Jacob, is a beautiful, smart, funny, and an adventerous person. But, he is a werewolf and hates Bella's bf. See, no one has the perfect attributes, to anyone. Bella is an attractive (not lesbian!) young girl that is insecure of herself. Thinking "How did I get a person like Edward!?"    I hope you liked my answer.  Good luck  Kaitlinn    P.S. I also REALLY like the Breakfast Club! Also Weird Science!|`|B4y9w6Braa	All Harry Potter movies!!!! =]]]]|`|WhlwZeiXaa	any jackie chan movie|`|7c4a5e9Caa	Probably Meet the Fockers or The Notebook|`|UQLHTT7Faa	That actually a hard question..; D ahhh id say ironman|`|NTFd0OkKaa	twilight and finding nemo and slumdog millionare.|`|hZ9omSataa	fight club|`|RK0z8OG4aa	step brothers lol|`|ACa1N4Jdaa	The day after tomorrow!|`|13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	Well, I am sure it isn't the same as yours...your a guy and mine is a "girly" movie...Pride and Prejudice.|`|HyBcKAf7aa	lord of the rings|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Bandits or ps I live you or finding nemo|`|qDctmJTeaa	My tops are :    Any Classic Disney Movie :  (1937 Snow White-2002 Lilo & Stitch)  & Pixar    Shawshank Redemption  Stand By Me  Forrest Gump  10 Things I Hate About you      My fave 80's ones:  Stand By Me  License to Drive  Say Anything  Back to the Future  Pretty in Pink  Breakfast Club  16 Candles|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	The Goonies!

BNHeJm8Maa	It depends on what movie she is in...I think she's pretty in PS. I love you but not at all in Millionaire Dollar Baby. She kinda reminds of Ellen deGeneres though...she's lacking in femininity.|`|KgK8z6tNaa	I loved this episode. I take neither side. I'm kinda in the middle. She's hot when she wants to be.|`|AA10368887	She is not ugly, nor does she look like a man. If you are seeing ugly or a man, perhaps you need to put the mirror down and look again.    One more thing: The Office is garbage.|`|AA11540024	I said not, she is ok but not hot
xggSASTwaa	oh you will totally move on when you realize how many HOT guys are in college! you will start going to awesome parties and meet lots of new people. I promise you will forget. Just dont dwell it and keep an open mind when you go to the new school and it willbe great!

Me neither. You just have to stay true to yourself. All you really need is a few really good friends. Or you at least need one person in the whole world that you can REALLY trust with ANYTHING.    For me, that would be my mom.    She stuck with me through everything.|`|ZIUDcqfmaa	yeah alot|`|MeGazyy7aa	2 Best Friends  3 or 4 friends.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	i have very, very, very few.|`|DPLjIsSaaa	I have about 12 friends.|`|bBHlGs5waa	Nope. =(|`|8Up0rUKeaa	yep  i have 38972936598179581|`|2a082AkHaa	I do but mostly are what I like to call "party friends", people to hang out with.

I get shizotypal sometimes though and decide that I don't like anyone... Sometimes I think I need new friends... or none at all.|`|OjS2wJZWaa	Yes I know a lot of people, but I have very few true friends...  Well, I'm not sure if I have a true friend...|`|2LpWgU20aa	alot of people like me and im sweet to everyone, but i only have about 5 really close friends. but im the type of person who can make u think ur my best friend, even though ur nothing more then an aquintence. so i guess u can say that people think i have lots of friends, but i only consider about four of them to be my friends. im more of a loner.|`|FgU7wYDSaa	unfortunately I don't have many either    I have like 3 good ones  I'm trying to make more that won't leave me later on|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	Yeah I have a lot of friends, but I don't have any or very few close friends...|`|2nkCO7HLaa	I have a lot of friends...

I'm not a member of any clubs though, and I only have the camera on my mobile phone, but I still like to take some snaps.  I'll have to get a good digital camera sometime.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Yes.

It sounds like a load of fun though so I would take polaroids. I think I just might buy one from a yard sale..hmm..|`|SpOB3HlCaa	Yeah actually I love it, but only with the manual SLR, I'm a 35mm anorak!  Love still shots of landscapes, or on low shutter speed, slightly overexposed.  Quite into the action shots too, I like capturing people with totally natural poses. It really works in the right setting, you've just gotta have the eye ;)|`|wC88aBxXaa	Yes mostly of this beautiful country I'm visiting and its people here in Singapore Its such a amazing city and everyone is so nice to this old white boy.I feel right at home.|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	I use to take many photographs of landscapes, portraits and general family photo's. I liked taking portraits the most with a zoom lens at about 130mm. There were some really good ones especially of Dogs.  I went to a photographic club once and gained some knowledge in personal development but I wasn't too interested in that. Other than that I didn't learn much than I already knew. I wanted to teach Photography at college but as I had no previous certificates I wasn't allowed to teach the subject even though I had quite a lot of hands on experience.|`|wBzv5awkaa	yeah all the time. i take them for pleasure, can be all sorts, friends, family, scenery etc. I also take them for dontstayin.com if I am at an event they are covering|`|zz4JkjbMaa	I take explicit pictures of myself and send them to men who will never get the chance|`|YfywVGn2aa	Yes, and any kind.|`|t4FBtIsTaa	Ones of people who don't know Im doing it, up girls skirts especially!|`|bwHWizWyaa	Nature stuff mostly.  No clubs yet.|`|TqUx0r23aa	i love taking photos! no im not part of a club its just a thing i do now and again    i enjoy nature and animal photos i espically love the diffrence between diffrent times of the day and at the diffrent times the diffrent ways the sun reflects the clouds     and of course wacky crazy pictures with my friends who doesnt take those? haha|`|dWAB9cLbaa	yep.!photographing & photoshop have stolen  my heart.!    i wish there were a photo club around here.  it'd be the best.
Z7c5d0nuaa	He is a poser poser who wants to be a poser but being really poserish about it but he's not doing a good job at being a poser so he's a poser but that's what he wanted since he wants to be a poser but since he's being called a poser then i guess...WAIT!    this question makes no sense! Nice Trickery...|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	Yes because he's changing himself to fit into a label.    MA: country girl...never been on a subway.  I used to listen to music on the school bus when I was in high school though...I listened to whatever I was in the mood for that day...mainly alternative rock.|`|7lCJsp0naa	Actually yes because the guy decided that he wanted to be poser, therefore meaning that before he was not, therefore making him a poser. English is funny.     MA: Yes, I crank up the volume and play all the death metal songs on my iPod and count how many people give me looks, and when I look them back, they turn away. But most of the time, it's whatever I feel like listening to.|`|WwXQCRcgaa	Why would he want to be in the the first place?    MQ:  No, when I'm in Subway I order my sub and talk to whoever I'm with.  =)  There are no actual subways in my city.  When I'm on the bus I listen to my cd player.|`|KKx8Mb63aa	Paradox!  I love them. aha.    MQ: We don't have a subway, but I think the skytrain is kind of like it?  Yeah I listen to music on transit. I listen to whatever comes on shuffle.|`|k4GqiB6taa	I'm confused to.  MQ:We don't have subways here in Texas.  I listen to music when i'm on the bus though.|`|YFN8ajOJaa	you must be in middle school.. its okay you will figure it out|`|eMOerg65aa	Poser?     "I'm confused right now..."  - Same here, your question is pretty confusing     MQ: Yes, anything really|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Yeah, if you try to impress others and do anything to fit in, you're a poser, poseur, and every other synonym for that word. lol     MQ: I hardly ever go in Subways, but if i did i'd probably listen to music in there. I'd listen to Underground bands, like The Velvet Underground (although well known on R&P).     =D

HZxX9ke8aa	midheaven is the house cusp that seperates 9 and 10th houses. if your MC in x sign, you look how its ruler positioned in your chart. the sign position of this ruler will show the quality of expression of the affairs of this house, whether emotional (water), mental/social (air, practical (earth or identity-related (fire signs).    the house position of this ruler will show in what life area the affairs of this house are manifested, or what means you will avail yourself of to satisfy the needs of this house.    the aspects to this ruler will show the ease or difficulty with which you experience or act out the affairs indicated by this house cusp.    so... this can be categorized under "house cusps in signs"     ascendant also a house cusp that seperates 1st and 12th houses.     in short, ascendant and 1st house and MC and 10th house pretty much the same thing.
BNHeJm8Maa	I blame her parents. They've turned her into an international money making machine and deprived her of a normal childhood in the process.

They're are people dying in this world because they don't have clean water, or they can't immunise themselves against common illnesses like the flu, and these horrible, spoilt brats are having temper tantrums because daddy didn't get them the right car or book the right band.

Being compared to someone.  Im a f*cking individual, Im not like anyone else.  4.  People drinking all my Capri Suns.....I get angry.  5.  When parents let their children talk to them like they are their slaves.  Whatever happened to "May I" or "Can you please get me (whatever)".  And the yes maams, and the no sirs.  Its yeah, no, get me this, I want that.  6.  When I go somewhere and some nasty chick accuses me and/or my friends of being jealous and giving them dirty looks.  Sorry, but Im not jealous of the ability to spread herpes to 3 different people in one night.  7.  Being called stupid.  If there is one thing I am not, its stupid.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	People who spit on the ground or out there windows  Smoking, Sorry I like to breath  SUV Drivers  Fishing License Laws (they make no freakin' sense)  Ants in my house|`|c1b5c1de3f2bf9266efbd5d1416e2edcaa	A$$holes.|`|DiWtE0Ksaa	when i forget my stuff for skool.....or  when someone just scares me behind my back!!!|`|1T0qFdMRaa	Boredom|`|6qtuzvN1aa	Today I decided that it would be a nice break in routine and send the kids to Daddy's after school rather than coming home to same ol same ol me. This was at 3 30. He dropped them off about 30 minutes ago right after picking up Chinese food for himself. Not for the children. Even though they were hungry. Even though my four year old came walking in the house screaming that she's hungry and wanted Chinese food too. Soooooo, it drives me a little insane that he didn't feed them dinner.     Tomorrow is Friday. He gets them Friday after school until Sunday. Tomorrow I will be sure to send them over hopped on sugar and caffeine.|`|dE5m2Krmaa	Wish is very laundry oriented.

Here's a suggestion you might want to consider.  In 1976, the movie Track of the Moon Beast came out.  In an all-too-brief segment we see a trio of three musicians playing a song that is probably called "California Lady".  This group is known only to history as "The Band that Played California Lady".  After the movie was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, the members of the band started to be referred to as "The Fish-Lipped Guy", "The Eskimo" and "The Friendly Back-Up Singer."    Why don't you devote your life to figuring out who these people actually were?    I can't help but feel this is a mystery that SHOULD be solved.|`|pbDLvO9Jaa	Farah Fawcett.

Y1aAGPURaa	It was snowing heavily and blowing to the point that visibility was almost zero when John (not the sharpest pencil in the batch) got off work.     He made his way to his car and wondered how he was going to make it home. He sat in his car while it warmed up and thought about his situation.     He finally remembered his dad's advice that if he got caught in a blizzard he should wait for a snow plow to come by and follow it. That way he would not get stuck in a snow drift.     This made him feel much better and sure enough in a little while a snow plow went by and he started to follow it.     As he followed the snow plow, he was feeling very smug as they continued and he was not having any problem with the blizzard conditions.     After an hour had passed, he was somewhat surprised when the snow plow stopped and the driver got out and came back to his car and signaled for him to roll down his window.     The snow plow driver wanted to know if he was all right as he had been following him for a long time.     John said that he was fine and told him of his dad's advice to follow a snow plow when caught in a blizzard.

HZxX9ke8aa	hmm... not because they are shallow but because they are not very resistant. as i said somewhere before, they'll go with the flow. and i can't see anything wrong to go with the "flow of beauty"    and... "if you are a SMART woman you can always have a pisces TOO"|`|2IddNqy9aa	I'm a pisces & i am really good looking. I'm not being arrogant, girls tell me i'm cute all the time.     Personally, i am not shallow. i'm deeper than edgar allen poe and shakespeare combined. & i don't even write poems.    Were nice to every one & easily make new friends, but you have to have a good personality and be good-looking to hook-up romantically with me.    i went out with a virgo who was good looking & i ended up hating her guts. Now i go out with a pisces who's really cute, and i love her more than life in it's self.|`|gjNB9HtUaa	well the one pisces i knew was pretty shallow.  they act nice but once you get to know them they are mean as hell.  pisces girls are nice, but the guys are dumb .|`|PXimiZCdaa	i dont know if that stuff is real, but i know a pisces, she is cruel,cold,shallow, and manipulative.|`|xv237Z5Jaa	I know a Pisces guy who is very deep and smart.  I don't think they seem shallow either.|`|9DYiyQbGaa	I'm a pisces and im not shallow. I wouldn't never be in a relationship with a girl for the simple fact that she is good looking. I need more than looks, that's just not enough. I think long and hard before entering into a relationship with anyone, because I want to make sure that it is going to be lasting.I look for women with substance and not just appearance. Though appearance does catch my eyes, an intelligent women keeps my attention.    And I can keep myself in line, I don't need a woman to give me orders.      Mature pisces|`|IaIBNChpaa	well pisceans like lovely things. they are actually more emotionally complex then we think. They are not shalow but they have an easy going air about them. And like everybody they are attracted to attractive things. i wouldnt call them shallow. but most piscean men love beautiful women full stop

iNKnyj7Qaa	Okay   for starters. Just Dance is alright. But she keeps on changing the sound so her voice changes with it.    I dispise Poker Face. It doesn't even make much sense. I don't get the hype.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Yeah, she's kinda all over the media right now...and it's only because her songs are catchy.  She can't sing that well, and she does have a weird look/style.|`|RYVKYYnAaa	i like a couple of her songs regardless of what anyone says. i do think that she dresses like a nut but i like her for her music, not how she looks or acts.|`|LaYlRSKIaa	I suppose electro-pop is "the new trend" in music. I kinda like her music, I've always been into techno/electronic music.    I don't think Christina Aguilera copied Lady Gaga, she's just going along with current trends.
d23F89ECaa	Why stop there?    make something like that at the personal level.  The economy would be saved.    Everyone has a personal illegal activity savings plan.  Kill someone and get off free with your illegal credit savings plan.      If you can't tell the sarcasm, I too think it's the stupidest idea ever thought up.  The United States and China just have to buy credits off of other countries in Europe that are WAY ahead of anyone else in terms of drastically reducing their carbon footprints and can carry on with their polluting.

T5Y3VQRtaa	These are for around the advanced beginner to the beginning intermediate if ya know what i mean. I added youtube links for you to listen to of some good recordings of the songs played right! =]    -First movement of the moonlight sonata. it sounds a bit tricky, but its really not. played right...its hauntingly gorgeous.  link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-m...    -fur elise. same deal.  link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n5ZSqMU0...    If you want it to "sound complicated" to impress someone without tryin too hard ;) go with "tarentella" by albert pieczonka. the notes and rhythms are nothing. you just gotta get the speed, which comes with practice. when my piano teacher suggested it...i almost fainted when i listened to it. then i looked at the music. not hard attt allllll.     link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQBbju3QQ...      This should be enough for you to start with! Let me know if you have questions...just email =]    hope this helps!|`|qvyI35r8aa	Mozart's Sonata K545.

It probably is easier than River Flows in You  Video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCSe66pWN...    The music to both of these are very easy to get a hold of.  I did a google search for both of them and got a free download for both of them.  Then you can print and enjoy!  Even if you choose not to play these, take the time and listen to them closely!

If we have curly hair, we want it straight;  If we have blue eyes, we want brown ones;  If we have dark hair, we want to be blonds;  And on, and on, and on...

jS4UoChZaa	i am!!!    edwaard is HOOOTOTOTOTOT!!!|`|Kgrq92Veaa	how darest you put a twilight question in comics and animation do it again and we will report the question because it is in th ewrong category (ok that wont happen but still plz be kind to our eyes and move the twilight questions into books and authors plz)|`|v1hCymAEaa	WRONG SECTION    Last time I checked Twilight is neither a comic or animation, go put this in books and authors or movies, it doesnt belong here.|`|ppMnVXmsaa	Seriously! I agree with all the pervious answerers!    Why did you find the need to post this particular (over done) question here of all places!    Twilight fan sites are all over. Do us a favor and join one.    PS> Edward sucks and Jacob is under appreciated.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Oh dear, what are we going to do with you?   It seems like another fan has misplaced their question.    Please, repost your question in Books and Authors (go under Arts and Humanities, you shall find it) or Movies. They probably don't want you there, so maybe Jokes and Riddles will do. Just not Comics and Animation.    Is Twilight a comic? Well, it IS comical, but it is indeed no comic.    Is Twilight an animation? Well, the animation/special effects in the movie are extremely poor and cannot be called animation.    So, find the proper category. We are sick of Twilight fans.    Thank you.   Goodbye.    P.S. Do not blame your computer.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Please post the question in another category, such as Authors & Books or Movies.    This question does not relate to Comics & Animation in anyway.    And, your computer has nothing to do with it.|`|nG5kgQmDaa	ME :) im also on team Alice(shes so awesome)|`|JgCGpQaxaa	Honestly, I would repeat what others have said, and say put this in Books and Authors, but I'd really ask you to reconsider and let the poor bastards over in B&A catch a break, and not ask this question at all.  I mean have you SEEN their section?  For like the past 6 months, 50% of all questions have been Twilight related.  And 99% of those are just the same ole repeats.    I bet you 20 bucks this question has already been asked over there.  So please, just let those poor poor souls off the hook, and go fangirl in a Twilight Forum or something instead of continueing this flood on Answers.  Or at the very least try SEARCHING for these questions that have already been asked.

xTioPxaVaa	A notch filter is one that will remove a certain group of frequencies from a signal.  The fact that it is sweepable means that you can pick the center frequency.      It's no different than using a graphic equalizer and pulling one of the sliders down.    Where this comes in handy is if you have certain notes that tend to really boom out louder than the rest.  This has more to do with the room that you're in than anything else.  While playing that booming note, you would rotate the notch filter until it gets reduced.      Greetings from Austin, TX    Ken

Gm5u4vWUaa	SPOILERS    There's a good amount of violence in this movie.  The boys mother is killed early on, he's tortured by the police.  A kids eyes are burned out.  you don't see much of it but it's implied.  Pretty much the 3 main characters in teh movie go through some pretty rough stuff.    It's not a family movie but it's not an adults only movie either.|`|uvYWR8u0aa	violance|`|c44dIboDaa	i am 16 and i just watched it..its a good movie..nothing bad about it..but for the young ones..well parents might not want their children to see the violence the police use...its not so bad but not easy either..u know?

And NEVER EVER EVER EVER go to a rap concert!!! I went to ONE and I'm NEVER going to one again. the atmosphere just sucks, and plus you have all the "gangsters" trying to start **** w/ EVERYBODY, and you can't even enjoy the show...  the only plus about going to a rap concert is all the good green getting passed left and right (but you can get that from metal concerts too...)lol|`|WhlwZeiXaa	you're listening to the wrong type of rap.  try shing02 or some other underground rapper.  they rap about better topics that use proper grammar, they show respect, and it just sounds better.    that being said, you clearly don't know what the concept of subjectiveness is.  music taste is very personal and no one's going to feel guilty for listening to it becuase HES NOT EVEN SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.|`|Z3l08BDAaa	your mom shouldve had the abortion

ZyGyDLsDaa	Day of the Animals (1977)?  aka Something Is Out There   starring Christopher George, Leslie Nielsen, Lynda Day George (Christopher George's wife), Richard Jaeckel, Michael Ansara, Ruth Roman, Jon Cedar, Paul Mantee, Andrew Stevens, Susan Backlinie (best known as Chrissie the first shark victim in "Jaws")  IMDb synopsis:  The depletion of Earth's ozone layer causes animals above the altitude of 5,000 feet to run amok, which is unfortunate for a group of hikers who get dropped off up there by helicopter just before the quarantine is announced.  IMDb review~~But, it's not a nice one:  Unlike most nature gone wild movies that focus on one deadly animal (snakes, spiders, small dogs wearing the cutest rat outfits), "Day of the Animals", like its predecessor "Frogs", throws every living creature at the cast. ... Rats and snakes are thrown at actors. A shirtless Leslie Nielsen gets attacked by a bear (rug, that is). Most laughably, the so-called attack dogs are downright lovable,  complete with wagging tails.   NOTE: I don't clearly recall the attacks in the movies and suppose that review is a tad exaggerated. I included it because of your description ("Rats, dogs, wild cats, all sorts of animals...").   Here are some clips from the movie:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNdDak7IO...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EzrlaN2d...    Encounter with the Unknown (1973)  IMDb synopsis:  Narrated by Rod Serling, these three eerie tales are based on actual events re-enacted here. First, three college students play a prank on a geeky classmate, who is accidentally shot and killed. His vengeful mother forecasts the deaths of the three young men she holds responsible, on 7, 14, and 21 days hence. And, one by one, her grim predictions come true. Next, a ghoulish sound emanates from a mist-shrouded hole in the ground near where a Missouri boy has lost his dog. The boy's father is lowered into the hole and lets out an agonizing scream! Finally, a man returning home from a party finds a lost girl on a bridge and learns from her father that she died years earlier.    Here's Part 1:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xvtVgCYk...|`|PttIFjhYaa	srry idk|`|YRlhQjeWaa	i know there is a movie called "Dogs" it about when dogs attack,i am sorry if its not it I AM ONLY 9 YEARS OLD LOL!!!!
k4pIGllXaa	I'm sorry, but I think it means that she's completely unsure and overwhelmed by what's going on- and wants it to be over. How long were you two together? Think about that and figure out how much drama/pressure was between you two. Maybe she did want out.  But please don't take our advice on this!- Once you have a roundabout idea- TALK TO HER! It'll show that you still care about what she feels even though she ended it with you (more or less). Good luck. =]|`|NYrEP8Ceaa	I think it means the relationship ended ( the rain was waving goodbye)  but when the night came ( when she misses/needs you) she wishes you'll come back and take her away and everything will be good again like a dream ? idk thats just what i got from it, good luck =]|`|CWkMRMwxaa	I think it means she's been overwhelmed by all kinds of emotions.  That she does like you, but is unsure about the situation.

01d9f7d86b08b714b8ed46b41571cfdaaa	In my experience, us scorpios don't do things out of pity.  Frankly, I'm more likely to tell someone to suck it up rather than actually comfort them (to be fair, this advice usually works better).   Also, we don't say things like "i love you" without good reason.  We are very loyal, so if he said that he would wait, its a good chance he will.    My advice, talk to him about what you need to do to get your life back to where you want it to be.  Tell him (honestly) that you aren't really sure about what's going on, and...well, you have to take it from there.|`|xUKLUSL5aa	a scorpio wont say i love you for no reason. he means it.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	how about being with him and promising him that you will try to lose weight? that would be a good start, especially for you.

(also L)|`|4b04c75387288f794c445a45826af7b1aa	Yup, with all these unique surreal qualities. :3  it's pretty sad when you realise there won't be people out there like that, but a good personality is one of the most important things someone needs, and there's plenty of people with that... hopefully :D lol|`|DpXZK7Q0aa	hehehe  hitsugaya toshiro   lol XD|`|9c967a3dfd362cd2c1bdfa87b431a6ddaa	Well i have high expectations for my other but i dont think they are unrealistic.

(For some reason I totally forgot until a while ago how much I loved Yuki, too, but Ha'ri and Kyonkichi are my top two.)    Since I have no significant other, I have not been dissatisfied by them, but I must say the boyfriend prospects have greatly diminished.|`|ow24bx2daa	I wouldnt mind if my boyfriend was Edward Elric... or maybe Ikuto from Shugo Chara. (actually, i would be demonically happy about it)    also, it would be kool if my boyfriend was a vampire^^ though, perhaps not a whiney vampire who always complains about how he doesnt want to hurt me by accident.    it would also be kool if i was the vampire, and my human was my boyfriend... *chuckles evily*|`|SGeT0xm5aa	Yeah I do.

AA11828080	I would most likely keep it. I guess it would depend on how my husband handled the situation. I would want to keep my baby. At that point, the father would just be a DNA contributor..the baby would be mine. I would not punish the child for the fathers evil actions. My only concern would be, if it was obvious the child was not the parented by my husband, would be what to tell him/her if they should ever ask. I read a story once YEARS ago, and it has stuck with me. It was of a young girl who was kidnapped and raped repeatedly (she was 15 at the time) later had her arms chopped off by her attacker and then left for dead. She survived and found out later she was pregnant. I will never forget the picture of her holding her baby with her prosthetic arms and grinning down at that beautiful baby boy. He came from something ugly that happened to her, but brought her amazing joy. I would hope that given the same choice I would be just as strong and clear eyed to see my baby as the beautiful creation all babies are, despite the circumstances of their conception. But that is my opinion in NO WAY would I pass judgment on someone else for their choices.|`|0eedf916188312e77d477085d1c3a8c5aa	Personally, I would keep the baby as the baby isn't just part of the rapist, but also a part of me and the child is the innocent one that didn't asked to be conceived, i mean neither did I,, but still the same ,that child would be a part of me therefore, the only choice i could make ,would be to have it and never tell the child they were a product of rape, I would figure something else 2 say to the child when he/she became old enough to wonder about their father/ "sperm donor".|`|ooQY7bXKaa	keep the aby then give it to the raper to keep|`|k3V2CA81aa	As much as I would hate myself for it, I would have an abortion...|`|gc0pHRUMaa	It's not the baby's fault.

This is assuming I was unable to take care of the child myself.However, if the pregnancy put my life at risk, I MIGHT consider getting an abortion. And if I felt like I could take care of the kid, I'd just keep it.|`|AA11378648	keep it and put it up 4 adoption bc i dnt believe  in abortion at all. i hate baby killers!|`|AA11905919	I would never murder someone which abortion is. So I would give it up for adoption. That's the best thing to do|`|XrEVUaGVaa	wow um GOD forbid that happen but if so then I would probably have the baby and then put it up for adoption. I personally couldn't go through with an abortion b/c my heart would't be able to bare it, so instead I would just let the baby be adopted. Besides it's not the childs fault y its here.|`|rHPaBXOhaa	I have been raped. Fortunately I didnt get pregnant but the fear that i could have been was definitely there.  Thankfully I didnt have to make a choice|`|Y25ba4K2aa	wow, this is a "baited" question if i ever saw one!|`|NkOPDFLfaa	Well since Ima dude....its not possible............but I would get an abortion and send the baby to heaven rather than have a baby with a mest up life with no father.|`|Xu9FLS6waa	It honestly would depend on what the girl herself could live with and how emotionally stable she will be.      There are many views on this topic but when it's all said and done, it really boils down too, what you as the woman can handle.     It's a double edged sword because parts of you don't want to bring a child into the world, and have resentment towards it. I know for alot of rape cases, there have been mothers who have distanced thereselves from the child, resulting in neglect of affection towards the child. The mother/child bond starts out broken which is honestly a sad thing. You also don't want to be reminded daily of the horrible person who did that too you...even though a child is precious I know some women end up feeling anger towards them.     Yet at the same time, you don't want to have an abortion. You don't want to do something that may haunt you for the rest of your life, or make you feel regret in the future.     Either way you go, this situation is difficult, but you have to do what's right for you.     I would never suggest abortion to another human being, because I believe everyones diffrent and handles things diffrently. But you asked if it were ME, on a personal level ( I'm not saying this is what you should do yourself and I'm not saying it's right)..if it were me in that situation, I would most likely decide on the abortion option.   I'm not saying it's the right thing to do, but for me personally at the stage Im at in my life, having a child wouldnt be an option.     The only thing that concerns me about adoption is that I've seen alot of women, go into the adoption process while pregnant, and then regret it the moment they have the child...but by then it's too late. Actually seeing the child in your hand and having it taken away...I don't know but for me personally I couldn't do it.     No one here can suggest the wrong or right thing for you to do, because all people and situations are NOT the same. It all boils down to what the woman herself can honestly handle and what she thinks is best for her and her life.   It makes me sad that any human being as to go through this, and if you or you have known anyone in this situation, I am truely sorry.      I wish the best of luck for all women in that situation and advice to do what they think is best, and not necciarly depend on someone else to make the decisson for them because that could result in future blame and regret.|`|lE5k5RFgaa	Keep.|`|daa14a77034f1efb1b24436d50d6aa63aa	I'd give birth to the baby then put it up for adoption.

2O1VefmHaa	In An American Carol a cynical, Anti-American Hollywood filmmaker sets out on a crusade to abolish the 4th of July holiday. He is visited by three spirits who take him on a hilarious journey in an attempt to show him the true meaning of America    In Fireproof...  Lt. Caleb Holt lives by the old firefighter's adage: Never leave your partner behind. Inside burning buildings, it's his natural instinct. In the cooling embers of his marriage, it's another story.    After a decade of marriage, Caleb and Catherine Holt have drifted so far apart that they are ready to move on without each other. Yet as they prepare to enter divorce proceedings, Caleb's dad asks his son to try an experiment: The Love Dare.    While hoping The Love Dare has nothing to do with his parents' newfound faith, Caleb commits to the challenge. But can he attempt to love his wife while avoiding God's love for him? Will he be able to demonstrate love over and over again to a person that's no longer receptive to his love? Or is this just another marriage destined to go up in smoke?       Personally...they both sound like crap to me.|`|AA11661965	Don't know anything about "firestorm", but I can't wait to see "An American Carol".

WdXZw3QRaa	Been a while since I've seen the movie, so I don't remember the song, but amazon has small samples from each song of the soundtrack on their site.    http://www.amazon.com/Royal-Tenenbaums-C...    Just click the link and about a quarter of the way down the page, it has the track listing with a "Listen" link to hear a sample of a song.  I do this every time I see a movie and want a song from it.

fe84f973d5aade53ec6bca2cddd4f034aa	Ni modo!!! no se la aprendio seria bueno mandarle la letra de la cancion para que se la prenda bien jajajaja       Aqui esta la letra y es "la maza sin cantera"    Si no creyera en la locura  de la garganta del sinsonte  si no creyera que en el monte  se esconde el trino y la pavura.    Si no creyera en la balanza  en la razn del equilibrio  si no creyera en el delirio  si no creyera en la esperanza.    Si no creyera en lo que agencio  si no creyera en mi camino  si no creyera en mi sonido  si no creyera en mi silencio.    Qu cosa fuera,  qu cosa fuera la maza sin cantera.    Un amasijo hecho de cuerdas y tendones  un revoltijo de carne con madera  un instrumento sin mejores resplandores  que lucecitas montadas para escena.    Qu cosa fuera, corazn, qu cosa fuera  qu cosa fuera la maza sin cantera    Un testaferro del traidor de los aplausos  un servidor de pasado en copa nueva  un eternizador de dioses del ocaso  jbilo hervido con trapo y lentejuela.    Qu cosa fuera, corazn, qu cosa fuera  qu cosa fuera la maza sin cantera.    Si no creyera en lo ms duro  si no creyera en el deseo  si no creyera en lo que creo  si no creyera en algo puro.    Si no creyera en cada herida  si no creyera en la que ronde  si no creyera en lo que esconde  hacerse hermano de la vida.    Si no creyera en quien me escucha  si no creyera en lo que duele  si no creyera en lo que quede  si no creyera en lo que lucha.      Saludos!!!    Por cierto es una de mis canciones favoritas|`|AA10664023	Realmente que esperabas...

AA10916001	I thought it was six "days" and he rested on the seventh.......at least that is what it says in Genesis.|`|AA11514493	I was taught "and on the seventh day, He rested."    He was done in six.|`|4iYfanYdaa	I thought six days and rested on the seventh.|`|oPQAPfYXaa	Genesis 2: 1-3:  "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation."     It would seem either possibility could be the case; but I would tend to agree with your husband..|`|AA10451832	Any time you think you or any scientist have the definitive answer on how and when God created the universe, God is being limited.  God is a bigger God than you and His way is far is beyond your comprehension.  God could have created  everything in 6 days or 600 billion days.  The one verse you  are relying on is the Biblical account, but day can be the same as "age."  My personal belief is that everything created  before the creation of man prepared the world for man. (oil,  climate, water, etc.)  The problem with both evolutionists and  creationanists is they fail to acknowledge the omnipotence  of God.  The bottom line is: God is and God created.  How  and when is a mystery and the Bible has never been intended to answer the mysteries of God.|`|uTsExKXBaa	The earth was created in six days not seven on the seveneth day God rested on the other six days God created the earth and everything thats in it so yeah.....|`|z4iJSuvQaa	the sabbath, sunday, the seventh day of the week

I'm constantly bemused as to why the worst elements of the American black underclass seem to be such a role-model for the rest of the world.  I think it starts when children find it so easy to relate to the actions, emotions and morals displayed by the "lifestyle" because they are so similar to the instinctive reactions of an inexperienced and uneducated child that the young can relate to these "gut"instincts rather than with the consideration, modesty and tolerance shown by a mature adult.    Hostile is easier than understanding......  Selfish is easier than generous...  Expecting respect is easier than actually earning it....  etc......    This way of dealing with stuff must be very attractive to children who see it as an accepted, often glamourised and even media-endorsed mirror of their own limited wants and needs without the restraint later learned by adult experience and intelligence.|`|vxeMZXrgaa	~all I can say is "be yourself"~|`|qorM9TfQaa	I'm sick of white people trying to be all ''gangsta'' because i don't even know what one is.

XQMm3Ahraa	wow took a while to get down here...anyway edward and alphone elric's mom died so they try to bring her back using alchemy which follows equivalent exchange (to gain something something of equal value must be lost) they broke the ules of alchemy and alphonse vanished and ed lost his leg. Ed sacrifised his right arm to bring his beloved brother back and transmuted al into  a suit of armour. So Ed vows to bring his brother back by bcoming a state alchemist and trying to find a philosifers stone, a rock that increases alchemic powers and allows the bending of the rules. And yes I like pi, HI, Yeah new fma series soon...oh yeah ed dowsn't die but he seals himself into a different dimension...which is why i am glad they are making the new series so they can fix thier wrongs|`|AA12298356	Okay I hope I don't give you too much information but    Edward and Alphonse Elric are brothers living in the village of Resembool in the country of Amestris. Their father, (Light) Hohenheim, left home when Edward and Alphonse were still very young. (Very young Al was only one) Years later, their mother, Trisha, dies of a terminal illness. After their mother's death, Ed and Al become determined to bring her back through the use of alchemy (If you've seend two eps you should know what alchemy is)  .They research Human Transmutation, a forbidden practice in which one attempts to bring back the dead. They know they don't know much about alchemy so they find a teacher. When they try the experiment though Ed loses his left leg and Al his entire body. In a desperate effort to save his brother, Edward sacrificed his right arm to transmute his brother's soul to a suit of armor. Some days later, an alchemist named Roy Mustang visits the Elric brothers and after discovering they tried revive their mother, he tells Edward to become a member from the State Military of the country to find a way to recover their bodies. After that, Edward's left leg and right arm are fitted with two sets of automail, (a type of advanced prosthetic limb,) created for him by his close family friends Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako.    Edward sets out to become a State Alchemist (which is an alchemist employed by the State Military of Amestris) Becoming a State Alchemist enables Edward to use the extensive resources available to them (money he he) so that they can get their original bodies back. but it also turns Ed into a "dog" of the military, who are famous for destroying almost all Ishbal's population in a past Civil War. (a holocoust)  The brothers learn of the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary stone that is said to allow the holder to completely bypass the law of Equivalent Exchange, and set off in search of it as a means to restore their bodies. Along the way they discover "Humonculus" (I don't think I spelled that right?) who are the failed attempts of human transmutation.  Who cannot die with out a special alchemic process. (I wont tell you any more though because it would spoil the whole show.    That should be plenty of information though |`|bz4VVIMZaa	The background is that 2 kids tryed to bring their mother back with alchemy (which is 4bidden by the law of alchemy) and it failed so they payed the price of a full body, and an arm and leg.  They now want 2 regain their original bodies back so they joined the military (because of their power they have access 2 more info & stuff)  and the adventure goes on but Ed doesn't die.  hope this helped.|`|rDr4ADIyaa	Its a great series to watch. I love how alchemy is about converting one energy to another. Two brothers try to bring their mother back, Ed ends up losing an arm and a leg, and Alphonse loses his body altogether. The series is about the brothers looking for a way to revert back to normal, only to find out the alchemy spell they used causes horrific consequences. The " sins " are homunculus, and they are the byproducts of trying to use alchemy to bring people back to life.     edit: you can say that they die, but that is only in the movie, the conqueror of shambala|`|dA7riZhxaa	Well First Off ... Hi. Also,  I Agree Cats Are Cuddly, And Pie Is The ****, Cant Get Enough Of It.  Second.   Basically The Background Is Al And Ed Pass The Exam And Then Are Sent On Missions   Alot Of Stuff Happens ,Lots Of Action Happen. Then They Start Searching For The Ferloserfer Stone( I Know I Spelt That Wrong.) But During This, You Meet THe Deadly Sins.( Envy, Lust , And Gluten) They Apper In the Series Alot.

MILK IS GOOD FOR YOU!  Pss. I Am Very Happy To Hear About The New Series Of FMA. |`|QSBbXNVIaa	lol, I know. Ed is the best!!    Anywho, the background is that Edward and Alphonse tried to bring back their mum after she died when they were very young (and bringing someone back to life is forbidden by the law of alchemy). However, this attempt failed, ultimately resulting in the loss of Ed's left leg and Al's entire body. In a desperate effort to save his brother, Edward sacrificed his right arm to affix his brother's soul to a suit of armor. Years later Ed joins the state military and Ed and Al attempt to find some way that they can get their bodies back to the way they were.     **SPOILER**                    Ed is about to die when Al gives up his life to save him. But when Ed realizes this he gives up his life so Al can live again (when he does this Al is returned to the way his body was before the suit of armor, only older), thus Ed is sent to the other side of the "gate", then it continues on into the movie -^^-    Hope I helped

AA12298356	Well it would be a good idea to go on their website. In the fine print they have a section for people who want to audition, they should have a number there for you to call (Expect to be on hold for a long time :])    I would try out for a few commercials first to get a good rep (if you have already that's great!)    That's pretty much all the information I can give you but check on different websites to see if you can get some more information.

V0Ps1juXaa	there are no inuyasha episodes past episode 167 "The Bond Between Them, Use the Sacred Jewel Shard!

4b04c75387288f794c445a45826af7b1aa	As with most things, the original is always better lol ^^ sorta...  Alot of animes are adaptations of manga, so there are parts cut out and improvised to shorten the running time. Also some things that may be seen extremely offensive will be changed or taken out(eg.blood, really racist words etc.) mostly in dubs Dx    With anime you have a set time to watch it, but everyone reads at different speeds and you can read and carry manga around easily at any times(unless you carry a portable dvd player everywhere.    Because some animes are adaptations they only tell part of the story(the first couple vols) and end it there, but the manga carries on the story, so people that wanna know what happens after that read it.    Mangas have extras in them too and in-depth explanation and fun facts, notes from the mangaka etc. which are fun to read too.    Most mangas of streaming anime are ahead of the anime(eg.Bleach, Naruto) and there's a huge amount of fillers which stray away from the original plot in them too. Many fans would prefer to follow the story this way(reading manga), in detail with art from the original mangaka.    It doesn't matter whether you watch anime or read manga, along as you like it, then yay! everyone is free to have their opinion :3|`|GC2ruUZdaa	Reading and viewing television are not the same act, so reading a manga is not "just like watching the show." There is also a good chance that there will be differences, minor or major, between the two.|`|A9KlJsC3aa	It's like seeing a film about your favourite book and being disappointed sometimes over the amount left out/changed etc.    Sometimes to make a film possible, scenes have to be cut for time and feasability and it is sometimes like that in an anime.    With anime, I've found that there are sometimes a lot of filler episodes with now real plot progression and there are some character changes that bug me.    Animes like D.Gray-man stay quite true to the plot in the manga but with Bleach there have been at least 2 seasons of filler episodes that didn't occur in the manga and somethimes its just annoying.    At times, an anime can be good; at others: disappointing, so, for me, it depends on the anime and how true to the plot it is as to whether I watch it as well as the manga.    I never watch an anime instead of a manga as then, I'd have no clue as to what was going on, but now, mangas are readily available on the net.  like mangafox.com    Hope you found it useful.|`|AA10851082	The shows sometimes end up being really terrible, excluding many details from the manga or skipping chapters of it altogether. Plus, more often than not I have seen them just finish the show at where ever they like and not finishing the manga, which leads to disappointment and frustration.     300 pages may be a lot, but if it's good then who cares?|`|lI8EwXZ3aa	If you watch the movie, you don't really get the time to see parts of it you like best. But I'd suggest movies. Sound^^|`|sdG5TpToaa	Since the manga usually comes out first, it's hard to wait for the anime if you're really into the series.|`|23y3JFmqaa	Manga's are more authentic, and just like a movie based off a book, it can leave a whole lot of the story out, or screw it up all together.  Also, you could melt your brains out watching TV, or read a book.  But I love my manga's, and I am obsessed with Anime to.\    Plus in the Animes, they leave out so much blood!!!!|`|AA12298356	Because sometime they change the manga like in  Full metal alchemist and Naruto... Or the manga comes out before the episodes so they read it before they see it...|`|kBk9jXVwaa	manga is the original, the real one! which means anime is just based on the manga. there are some other information about manga that sometimes isn't shown in the anime, sometimes when the anime ends, and the manga is still running the manga has a different ending, I really recommenced you read the manga for it has a lot more info and no fillers!

Still have not found one I like!|`|SqThpfppaa	You sound very biassed. There's nothing wrong with offal.  And what do you mean haggis isn't commonplace in the UK? It originates in Scotland.  Sounds like you were brought up on hamburgers and chicken nuggets.|`|9Wv2yJIzaa	Depends what it was. If someone put some bulls bollock in front of me and said it tasted good, I wouldn't care if it tasted of ***** cherry pie I wouldn't eat it.|`|UAk6LyD3aa	I would possibly be grossed out.  I have eaten grasshoppers fried, but I just don't like 'strange' food,  I know it is completely psychological and cultural but it is hard wired and could only really overcome it due to extreme hunger or some form of duress.  I am cool with liver and kidney but I know they are offal too they just seem 'normal'.|`|8rso8IU2aa	I love eating liver pate, kidney and haggis. I also like squid. Black pudding is OK, but doesn't have much flavour.    It seems like a slightly odd question to call these new foods, as these are everyday foods - apart from haggis which I have to make do with once a year when the supermarkets sell it in England.|`|hUbETXKpaa	i agree with Andrew f.    i like offal especially liver and bacon,i love squid! and actually ALL of these are common place unless you lived a life off chicken nuggets and chips.    even my 2 yr old daughter loves offal, whats wrong with it? have you never had steak and kidney pudding!?!?

531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	"When confidential information leaks out of an organization, people suspect a spy, not a psychic."        --John Allen Paulos, Innumeracy    I'd ask a "psychic" if you can predict the future, why do you need "props" that depend on randomness?  Can you pass simple double blind tests that can eliminate any self-deception?    Also why doesn't a big corporation hire you for a huge salary instead of the much smaller money that you get from gullible people? There is a million dollars waiting for the first person that can prove any paranormal ability or event. Until someone does this, all we have is their word.

Leaving an untenable situation and charting a new course. Passage from difficulty and progress towards a solution. The road to recovery. Travel and exploration.    The card at the top right represents how you see your partner. Four of Cups (Luxury): Being surrounded by love and devotion but taking it for granted. Ignoring the real and longing for the indefinable. Apathy and disengagement from the world. Dissatisfaction with the condition and direction of affairs, but the inability to accept new opportunities.    The card in the center left represents how you feel about your partner. Four of Pentacles (Power): Cleaving to earthly power in the desperate fear that it will be lost. Making yourself an obstacle to progress due to lack of originality and a desperate fear of change. Believing that security and identity are based primarily on the possession of material things. Coveting things and people. Living in a cloud of suspicion and prejudice.    The card in the center right represents what stands between you and your partner. Two of Swords (Peace): Contradictory characteristics brought together as a means of resolving a conflict. Refusing to be ruled by negative emotions. Strife brought to a close through clarity of mind and restraint of force. Turning a blind eye to the minor infractions of others.    The card in the lower left represents how your partner sees you. King of Wands: The essence of fire behaving as air, such as lightning: A great and daring leader who inspires others to rise to challenges alongside him. An artist who can take hold of an idea and make it a reality through bold action. One who is forceful, charismatic, and honest, leading by example, but unafraid to invest authority in others. A dashing and magnetic personality, carrying authority naturally, and striking at the world with swiftness and grace.    The card in the lower right represents what your partner feels about you. The Hanged Man: Pausing to reflect. Surrendering to an experience. Adjusting to new ideas through sacrifice. Opening oneself to intuition and enhanced awareness. Letting go of past patterns and growing beyond them. Inner peace, faith, and serenity.    The card in the center represents the present status or challenge of the relationship. Five of Swords (Defeat): A success earned through personal degradation. Separation from friends brought about by an unfeeling and coldly calculated act. Temporary victory tainted by dishonor and providing fuel for eventual defeat.|`|8q09cPiBaa	POOH    how do i pick best answer when the people already piced it for me?  and dayum your addicted girl    >:D

S1A20Oouaa	I don't like her|`|sJs0nuTSaa	For the most part, my views are different than hers.  That being said, I think she brought more to the show than Debbie Mattinopolis, sorry for the spelling, did on the first season of the show.  Her constant support for most things Republican is very annoying, just as Joy's constant Bush bashing is annoying.  I hate when the others are asking a question she seems to not want to deal with, or asking about someone she supports and they don't.  She'll bring up other wrongdoings by others/Democrats instead of just answering the question.  It's like when I ask my 3 year old if she if she hit her sister, and a get a 2 minute list of everything her sister did to her instead of just a yes.|`|eNvMKLFsaa	They had to get one pretty face with common sense on the show !|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Putting aside the opinions of politics I think that she is very intelligent.

Sherry is the least like able of all, in my view.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I like both her and Sherrie.  They seem to have the best interaction with each other.

I love them all.

Seldom is one found that is "mensch". Some men are mensurable. The mental capacity of men is something to really wonder about. The mentation of men needs to be observed constantly.Most men need a mentee.  Mendelism assures us these characteristics of the male are passed on from one generation to the next.      It needs to be mentioned on this menu, though, most women do love men.  LOL.

It was to confusing.|`|4jGB0MH1aa	Well, I'm not sure if you want to call them real movies, but I'll take these from Disney Channel.  Okay, number 1:  Halloweentown 4:Return to Halloweentown.  It absolutely sucked without Kimberly J. Brown and the plot was average to poor.  Number 2:  The Cheetah Girls:One World.  Yet again Disney coughed up yet another poor, poor, poor plot!  The first time I watched it I gave it a D+.  On watching it the second time, I changed my mind and gave it a C-.  But I must give them their props for the good coreography and the three good songs throughout the entire movie.  Those songs were, in this order: Cheetah Love, Dance Me If You Can, and One World.  Mkay, rant over. :)

da7e75b17cdf16ecebf8560ad9150318aa	He killed her himself. She didn't die from the robbers. She made Leonard believe several times again, that she hadn't had her injection yet (she's a diabetic). He gave her too many injections, because he couldn't remember (no short term memory) that he'd given her an injection already. Because of that, she died.     Sammy on the contrary, was a fraud he'd caught once. That used to be Leonard's job. He mixed the story up with his own life. Sammy hadn't lost his short term memory, he only claimed he had.|`|64c4cae6abd2513db63e5fd5ab82ba77aa	He killed her himself, there were no robbers, He imagined them.|`|0b742155912ce94af5497399f586d185aa	Leonard's wife actually survived the incident that took away his long term memory.    Leonard killed her by giving her too many insulin shots. His telling of the Sammy Jenkis story was really his story. Over all these years he had even tricked himself into believing that Sammy Jenkis was real. We all lie to ourselves to make ourselves feel better...|`|7db2d90def4dffb8f0ba2861c88a589faa	She survived the robbery. She died of insulin poisoning. The Sammy story he told was actually Leonard's story.

Da kann ich immer sehen, wie es im Hafen von Barth an der Ostsee aussieht und das eben wie schon gesagt zu jeder Zeit. Dann hab ich noch bei meinen Favoriten die Webcams von  - Zingst,  - Ahrenshoop,  - Dierhagen,  - Prerow und  Warnemnde eingebunden. So kann ich immer schnell gucken, wie dort die Lage ist.

Ich fin das vor allem wichtig, wenn ich in die Berge fahre, denn obwohl ich nahe der Alpen wohne, kann das Wetter in den Bergen komplett anders sein als bei mir zu Hause.|`|b9fd2f285ec152973c739133f091fc4aaa	Ich hab ne Webcam.

Es gibt superspannende Webcams. Ich finde zum Beispiel Webcams in grossen Passagierschiff- und/oder Frachth?ften interessant. Aber auch z.B. Webcams, die belebte Strassen zeigen (z.B. von NYC). -- Ausserdem kenne ich mehrere Leute, die eine Webcam installiert haben und die z.B. ihren Garten online stellen. Bei einem Kollegen kann ich dann jeweils die Hunde herumtollen sehen und kann feststellen, wie das Wetter dort gerade ist. Das ist zeitweise noch ganz witzig.    Natrlich wrde ich nie stundenlang WebCam-guckend vor dem PC sitzen, und eine WebCam ersetzt natrlich niemals das Reisen an sich.

Beispiel ist Samedan, der "Haus- und Hof- Flugplatz" von St. Moritz. Der liegt mitten in den Bergen und ist auch noch der h?chtsgelegene in Europa. Dort reicht es nicht aus, auf der Bahn gute Sicht zu haben, wie es die Vorschriften vorsehen, auch das Gel?nde rundherum muss gut zu sehen sein.

iSNtznE3aa	Iced tea or a frappucino...I don't like regular tea or regular coffee. If I can use a whole lot of sweetners and special flavors, I choose coffee. If I can't, I choose tea.    Um...Chocolate? I don't really like either.    Oh...naked if I'm in the house...if I go in public, I'll go with the fur, but it better be fur that was gotten off an animal that died naturally, not an animal that was hunted.    Pants. Jeans, to be exact. I have a skin condition, so showing my legs is something I try to avoid whenever possible.    Cute - except for occasionally, when I'm with my boyfriend. But even then, cute normally ranks over sexy.    The baby seals, for sure. I would do anything in my power to save them and all the other animals. The people...not my problem. But the animals? Totally my problem. You would have to know me really well to understand that. Trust me, I'm up for saving the kids too. But if those baby seals die, a part of me dies.

21436dbcef5f099ba1cf78caa476508baa	Not new age at all.  The answers above are correct about it being a scientific symbol.  They are a Contemporary Christian band and that would be a conflict of interest for them to have a new age symbol on that cd cover.|`|1803b6eed8a5cfe14f232caf6d86ee42aa	No new age symbol here. The kid is looking up at a symbol for an atom. The center spot is the nucleus and the dots going around are electrons. If my high school chemistry doesn't fail me, the four electrons tell us that there will also be four protons (unless it is an ion) and as such the element is Beryllium. Probably no reason for it to be Beryllium other than it makes a nice picture.|`|dd9beb0c67e4121b963282a433a01bebaa	its like an atom. I learned about them in High School

I think Will was a great player, but he's a doctor so I don't really think he needs the money. I think I'll probably vote for Danelle because I think she needs it most. Plus she really was awesome this season.|`|52b43ede8886734307197926a02f6cfbaa	I think George should win, he had to lose his job to be on the show, and he was the ONLY one on the show that played the game without all the lies and the cheating.....GO GEORGE!!!

AA11043435	The designer is a basic term.  Just to clarify there are costume designers, set designers, lighting designers, prop designers and many others, depending on the size of the company and the directors feel.  They all work in conjuntion with one another and some may hold more than one position within a company.  The set designer and lighting designer usually work together under the direction of the director.  And they usually make the set that gets interacted with along with the scenery in the background.  So if the designer in question is responsible for all designing then the answer to your question is yes they do design the scenery but it also has to work with the directors vision.|`|e3424c45383ffb67e814f757c106592baa	do you mean the director of the play?  yes if there is not set designer, even then the director has final say in everything.

AA11939795	Oh this is interesting!    I don't know what Jigsaw would do for a test, it would appear that Jason has gone through quite a lot of those. For all the sins he committed, there would have to be extreme retribution. Since Jigsaw teaches brutal and bloody lessons, I think it would be tough because they both have a level of extremity. That being said, how about this:  If I was writing a story about those 2, I would get a 3rd party first that would summon the 2 together... along the lines of mediums, etc. That person would obviously be killed to begin with because of the meddling into things unknown... then, once the 2 get together... Jigsaw could just get it over with. After all these years, we as the audience assume too much... we don't know if Jason can read or even comprehend, he just kills; Jigsaw on the other hand has a different perspective, which makes him interesting.  If it were a bloody battle for a showdown, like being on top of a house and wielding a chainsaw, that wouldn't work to Jason's advantage- Jigsaw is too smart. Maybe in the long run, Jason would let his heart give out, but then that wouldn't make sense either would it?- I think there was one of the series where his heart was taken, wasn't there?! I'd like to see what others have to write in regards to this cool question! Thanks for reading mine!|`|27a97f47d8c99e2837e4d1a9c3b49347aa	ummm he would possibly tape jason naked to a tree and put honey on him so bears come out and eat him then so jason wouldnt come back jigsaw would take those bears and burn them since they have part of jason inside of them...... then he would take the ashes of the bears and but them in seperate earns then send the different earns to different parts of the country and put them 30 feet under ground :-) thats becuase jason needed to learn his lesson of all the stuff he has done in his life and all the people he has killed !  :-)|`|4c3dc31e6d7cb5103d7f2bb281d5b7dfaa	Jason can't be killed. he always comes back.

A mi se me salen las lagrimas cuando voy a la orilla del mar y miro el sol naciente , veo la inmensidad de lo divino, de lo perfecto y eso me llena de gozo y agradecimiento, eso es llorar de alegria, por que el alma se ensancha, se engrandece.  Por eso no debemos hacerle da?o a nada . ni siquiera a una hormiga, todo tiene un porque en esta inmensidad, riquezas hay para todos , aqui todo sobra, nada falta, solo el sentimiento de pobreza y necesidad atrae a lo malo, el odio se convierte en amor, el amor en esperanza.|`|auLrRiIhaa	De alegria si.... de ira... no...|`|GXIRyVW7aa	de alegria si, de ira no|`|qfGWdeqiaa	si claro que si,  es tan distino esos dos tipos de llanto!!!|`|bwbBMgZ1aa	Si he llorado de alegria, cuando se casaron mis hijos la emocion me embargo de tal forma y la alegria de ver mis  hijos casandose provocaron  lagrimas en mis ojos   De ira  jamas llore |`|aWqtBbtyaa	si de alegria cuando tuve a mi bebe en mis brazos despues de 9 largos meses  y tambien llore de ira una vez q vi a un ex con otra tipa... desgraciado!!!!|`|Nh4nLGwHaa	He llorado de alegra y de ira.. pero no a la ves.. para mi concepto son dos sentimiento muy diferentes, el que tiene los dos al mismo tiempo no sabe que es bueno ni que es malo.. chau! saludos|`|cb289e1234c6911eb0ff198d69425467aa	Si por supuesto, de bronca, de impotencia, de dolor, de risa, de alegra y de emocin.

SpjQIIt5aa	Non ci sono delle fasi musicali precise, ognuno ha le proprie fasi, e logicamente pi diventi grande e pi si sviluppano e cambiano i gusti.  Di solito da bambini si ascolta sempre la musica commerciale perch si viene influenzati dagli adulti ma alla fine dipende dalle persone XD  Ad esempio io a otto anni impazzivo per le tatu XD e ho sempre trovato odiosi i cantanti pop fascion che se la tiravano.  Poi a undici anni ho scoperto i the rasmus e divennero il mio gruppo in assoluto,seguirono gli him,poi l inevitabile periodo green day,e placebo depeche mode,blink182,my chemical romance.  Poi ho scoperto il posthardcore con gli escape the fate e mi piacevano tanto i pezzi screamo, cos ho cominciato con i silverstein,hawthorne heigth,a static lullaby,,alesana e i gruppi andavano sempre pi nel growl e cos dallo screamo al deathcore,specialmente i bring me the horizon =]  tutt ora screamo e deathcore rimangono i miei genieri preferiti X]  Tutti questi passaggi accadono naturalmente e  non te ne accorgi neanche.|`|K953a1eTaa	fino a circa 11 anni ascoltavo musica commerciale, poi ho iniziato ad ascoltare gruppi come il Linkin Park, i Limp Bizkit, i Korn, i Blink 182 ecc.  Poi da quando ho iniziato a suonare la chitarra, ho iniziato a capirci di pi, e ho iniziato ad ascoltare Blues, Hard Rock, Metal e altri generi...|`|uhOkvtFraa	dipende, io sono una persona stana e in 10 anni ho acoltato police e dire straits, per un anno hardcore punk, poi un metal misto rapcore,cercando di arrivare a sonorit sempre pi estreme. adesso, ascolto molto il rock anni 80 e il punk, per, la mia riceca sul metal mi ha portato ad ascotare un genere quasi inascoltabile: il BRUTAL DEATH/BLACK METAL, un genere che spacca nel vero senso della parola. cmq dipende dai momenti e dale persone che frrquenti|`|nkINsoFAaa	Per me  una czzata, uno ascolta quello che vuole all'et che vuole|`|81nF0bUjaa	Nasci, cresci, ti riproduci e muori.  E' il cerchio della vita.  E' la musica te la scegli tu.. non esistono mica delle fasi prestabilite.  >_  Comunque io ho fatto cos:  fino a 12 anni: solo Pop.  da 12 a 14: Pop Rock, pop punk, un p di rnb..  Da 14 a 15: Pop punk, rock classico, rock (in genere le + famose), sempre meno pop..  Da 15 a 16: molto meno pop e pi rock..  ora ho 17: per ora ascolto principalmente indie, alternative, un p di sano pop e di rock classico.. qualcosina di metal anche.. diciamo un mix di tutto. ;)  ma in genere ascolto di tutto, cio se mi piace una canzone (tanto x fare un esempio) di britney spears.. me l'ascolto senza problemi!    ciao buon anno!|`|n1We5SD8aa	Odiata la musica fino ai 13 anni... scoperto il metal... amata la musica!|`|uCraEL2oaa	13 anni green day,  14 anni ho avuto un mix tra punk (ramones, bad religion), rock classico (led zeppelin, pink floyd), grunge (mitici nirvana) e metal (iron maiden, metallica)  ora che ho 15 anni ho un vasto repertorio!!|`|gmC6vRLOaa	Ma nn ci sono delle fasi..  Cmq io fino a 13 anni ascoltavo solo pop e ste m inchiate  poi delle mie amiche mi hanno fatto conoscere il rock e adesso ascolto principalmente punk e poi anke metal e rock cm i Guns o i Motley Crue|`|lCjjClOcaa	Io ascolto i Depeche Mode da quando ho quattro anni,e li ascolto ancora( il mio gruppo preferito).....i miei gusti sono sempre gli stessi,solo migliorati ed evoluti      Qui sotto Morrisina ha assolutamente ragione,segui i tuoi gusti,cos vai sul sicuro|`|at2SKXAZaa	Dipende, io a otto anni ho iniziato con Ligabue poi, a 12 anni, ho iniziato a cercare tra gli LP di mio padre qualcosa che mi potesse interessare e ho trovato il rock degli anni 60 e 70. Ma gli ACDC li ho scoperti da solo !|`|S6N0iqqJaa	poi si passa a quello che tipiace....io non do retta a chi mi dice che se ascolto i Doors mi devono per forza piacere anche i led zeppelin, a me non piacciono e non li ascolto, devi seguire i tuoi gusti....|`|p2pBKqdeaa	eCCO COME PERDERE 5 PNT!! NN SAI PROPRIO COSA CHIEDERE???  VA BHE I PUNTI SONO TUOI|`|JnEt83xVaa	nn credo c siano delle fasi... o.|`|4pXYPaw0aa	daccordo cn JKS XD|`|KNP2DF1eaa	Quoto JKS in pieno, perch bisogna dare un et a tutto?|`|e809edd3849b0df1d9ffa4e56c9c1e6baa	si inizia dalla musica truzza|`|VkODNn4Baa	a otto queen, beatles, ron...    a 14 doors, nirvana...    a 18 pestilence, necrophagist, death, nocturnus, mayhem...|`|EBFSNxG9aa	No, non  sempre cos.    Pensa che io, il primo artista che ho ascoltato  stato Francesco Guccini! Non sto scherzando... Ovviamente, devo ringraziare mio padre per questo.  Poi sono arrivati altri cantautori: Fabrizio De Andr, ovviamente, ma anche Roberto Vecchioni, Francesco De Gregori... e anche gruppi come i Nomadi. Il pop commerciale l'ho solo sfiorato, prima di abbandonarlo del tutto. L'house, sempre odiata.  Poi a 14 anni circa, scopro, quasi contemporaneamente, jazz e rock (soprattutto progressive). E oggi, insieme ai cantautori, sono questi i generi che accompagnano le mie giornate. Senza sottovalutare i vari generi derivati, fusion e funk da una parte, metal e punk dall'altra. E senza sottovalutare tutto il resto come la classica, il blues, la new-age...

e272d58c339d0f7252acddfec6daa7a1aa	hear me out first and then think about what im about to say.  i am an avid punk fan.  rancid, op ivy, GBH, sex pistols, social d, green day whatever it is...if its punk im a fan.  now with that said heres an answer for you.  whether most people want to admit it or not punk (or the punk grandchildren) is a popular music scene.  and when something like that happens it opens doors for people.  and when a door is openend for someone who has never been exposed to something before, a lighter version is easier to accept and enjoy.  green day had been around long before dookie (and thanks to lars fredrickson auditioning for rancid we have bj as the lead singer of green day) and when that album came around many people had not been exposed to the punk scene as there had been when it hit shelves.  it united many social groups of kids throughout the country...jocks listened to it before games, the skaters listened to it on the streets, if you were old enough to listen to music chances are you liked that album.  i actually had purchased kerplunk (green days second full release) and was stoked to see dookie.  but not all of my friends were avid punk fans.  so when they started listening to green day they realized that they might enjoy other punk bands too.  and from there those friends have learned about the history of punk and have become experts in that genre of music and lifestyle.    now for today...simple plan, fall out boy, good charlotte etc...have become popular in the publics eye and have opened a door for a younger generation who could very well want to learn more about the roots of this style of music.  *and also id like to point out that these bands do not suck....this is a matter of opinion and to say the 'suck' is just an ignorant statment that is very closeminded.  apparently they are making millions and we (the average person) are not...so to say that they suck just doesnt work.  they might not be your taste of music but their talent has nothing to do with that.  i am not a fan of metallica but do i recognize that they are gifted and have a huuuuge following, yes.  willi purchase any of their stuff, not in a million years.*  but these bands today could very well be a stepping stone for the punk rockers of tomorrow.  keep in mind that no one starts out with using heroine...they usually work up to it ;-)|`|7069c5629ec2bb87040aa9c67a7bd700aa	What old green day.??......and it really does   Suck .....sry|`|AA11867707	here you wanna here my opinion.

I'd check out their older material as well as their newer stuff--it's quite different.    I'd highly recommend atom heart as well, in the "beats" genre. He does a lot of Latin inspired rhythms, but it's all done electronically.    another answerer said hot hot heat--i'd definitely second that! it's pretty 'out there', but excellent.    also check out can.    Still, all of these examples could more or less be considered "pop culture", even though they're more fringe and not very "poppy" in the usual sense.    what are examples of things you like or don't like? (you can add more details to your question to clarify.)    depending on what you mean by "not pop culture", you might want to check out the "20th century" section in a music shop, and listen around. (the genre refers to "20th century composers", and tends to be very "experimental".)|`|bc8a47c9e9b3464a72bbfa20fe37cec4aa	the faint or hot hot heat, they are both revolutionary but slighty rock|`|f133025fa90f801b36160497854e0866aa	You can try Aya.

The reason being that should they read what you send and  they come out with a similar series, you can sue them for stealing your  idea. They may already have that idea on the drawing board.. Not to  mention they have their own people or contacts to come up with ideas.  You need to finish your books, find an agent and then get them published  And if you self publish, make sure you do the copyright thing. Good luck on  your venture. don't give up or get discouraged and I'll keep an eye out for  your books.

58fc35b079047b98397ce8a5c0a8618eaa	Yeah, I like them. I consider them now one of my favorite bands. I love their new song "When you were young" and love the video. I guess that song would be my favorite now. But I also love "Somebody told me", "All these things that I've done" and I like "Mr.Brightside" but the song isn't as good as the others I love.  But yes, they are a cool band, I haven't really heard their new song "Bones" yet that much and I saw a little clip of the video, it looks cool with the skeleton and everything. You know, the video is directed by Tim Burton- who also directed Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, Nightmare before Christmas and more. The first music video directed by Tim Burton, by the way. So I look forward to seeing the whole video for "bones" and hearing the whole song. I'm sure I'll like it.|`|974548c3ae8089b2ba2985a9909db0bdaa	I love them and my favorite song from them is "Somebody told Me".|`|0d8da5dfe37571fca9c93425b60249f1aa	pretentious wannabes|`|AA10215876	i love "smile like you mean it." its such a sweet song. and i like their new single, "when you were young", too. and the band is just sorta fun to listen to. its not like theyre trying to write deep meaningful bob dylan=esque stuff, they just make music thats fun.|`|431dcb745f1acaa7caa1b8ebeb4f807eaa	i     and I like them because their songs are all kind of up beat and actually a little playful, like "somebody told me"|`|2ce20c34c68a5622d75c8c7a320bd2e6aa	are awsome|`|c361bb472cee0c84e2b94b03d316f3daaa	i hate them|`|b41aaafb27d3dc31452a50a09d169da8aa	i thought i liked them. omg brandon looks so good with his mustache thingie but that new song "bones" sucks butt and the special effects are poorly done. i do like when you were young that video//song was good.|`|be1daf7ba6b004792f9caea4e640d214aa	I love the killers.  I like "smile like you mean it" because its so melodically cynical, a clever representation of love and irony.  I agree the killers aren't very singer,song-writer material, but they know how to peice together a cleverly simple tale with some ironic chord progressions. I love it.  I also like "on top" but i think thats just because of the sex.  Now I have always been so confused about the song "Andy your a star" because either he has intense admiration for a male jock, or it's song from a girl's point of view.... I admit i tend to take it in the former.  I love their musicianship and their techno-style groove.  Nothing feels better than riding in the car and trying to contain yourself from dancing to a tune from the killers...

It's a case of a stitch in time.|`|AA11595346	If you have a loose thread on your clothing, it can pull out and make a larger hole.  If you stitch the small hole early on, it will save you the trouble of stitching the larger hole later.  A stitch right now saves 9 stitches later.|`|6d4903572892f19195aec288101cefdfaa	An analogy. If you do something now, instead of waiting until it's to late, you may avoid several steps in correcting a problem your delay created.|`|67e6cbb4e3bef482cb7050ac19e417b9aa	If u do not stitch a cloth when it is torn slightly, the cloth gets more torn from the place it got torn initially. So u stitch at the correct time, you require only one, else you require more.
da7e75b17cdf16ecebf8560ad9150318aa	Lyrics    Count your blessings one by one,  When dawn appears and day has just begun;  They will light your heart with happiness,  Make each hour bright and bring your gladness.  Count your blessings one by one,  When twilight falls and toil of day is done.  And in sweet dreams they'll come again to you,  If you will count your blessings each day through.    Count your blessings while you may,  For we arc here but little time to stay;  All around are hearts sincere and true,  Lovely things abound just waiting for you;  Count your blessings while you may  The big or small, whichever comes your way,  For then you'll find this world a place of love  If you will count your blessings from above.|`|6e57f70a6a597d991e6de1539113927aaa	I know that song too, don't know all the words to it but it was, Count your blessings instead of sheep......?

Again I am assuming you have this.    Ok, go to Limewire and download a song, just to test. When it is finished downloading, go to your Itunes music site. At the top of your screen is the tool bar. Open up the "Import" file under the "File" Category (I think it is called File, but it is the category all the way left on the toolbar.)    When you highlight the import file, choose "browse" to find your limewire file. Under this file, you should see your song. Highlight it and hit "Open". Bing! The file will be in your music list in ITunes. Hook up your iPod and it will update it. No fuss, no mess!|`|76d37e4e82379f4203f917df5b9080dcaa	Go to rocketmp3.com it is better...

bc3ba2c9c87e6b9774330feca7400ad9aa	Clearly some of your past responses don't play drums seeing as Zildjian doesn't make drums. They make cymbals and drumsticks. Also, Peavy, while having a unique style and approach, isn't a good choice for beginner drumset, and is not well appreciated in the drumming community. So here it goes......    I recommend Guitar Center. They are all helpful, plus they will work with you on price matching, etc. I have friends that work there, when I need something, they have tha abilitiy to mark down as much as they want and just claim it was a scratched floor model or something.     As for drumkits, I recommend for starters, the Pearl Export or DW entry level kits. Both of these are well priced under a grand, but quality enough that they will work when you start playing out. As for cymbals, I'd stick with Zildjian, preferably A's. They are the oldest cymbal company dating over 300yrs old. They know what they are doing. If you can't afford the top of the line cymbal, then they have beginner packs for about $300-500. That will get you started, But when you start playing out you should upgrade to the A's. The budget cymbals are punched out sheet metal, where as the A's are cast bronze and spun to the proper size. The sound is very clear. Finally, for sticks, any one will be fine, as long as they are not the defect no-names. You want straight sticks, and big name manufacturer will have those. Maybe in a size 5b, a good all-around size for dumset playing|`|0a0e8925f8180affbb756805b79d8a5eaa	musicainsfriend.com, try zildjian drums, remo heads, pearl, those are all good brands. And buy plenty of sticks.......depending on what kind of drumming you plan on playing.

45a1015e53756570285bb0db36d3763aaa	lol im sure there are loads more of you ;-)    Ancient Chinese wisdom says a Snake in the house is a good omen because it means your family will not starve. This could be taken metaphorically to mean that a Snake could never have a problem with his family starving because he is such a great mediator, making him good at business. Or it could mean that a Snake would be willing to sacrifice his possessions, something the Snake has a lot of, in order to pay for his familys food. Any way it is interpreted is representative of the Snakes character and is a measure of the value he puts on his material wealth. The Snake is keen and cunning, quite intelligent and wise.    The Snake is the intuitive, introspective, refined and collected of the Animal Signs. They are attractive people who take cries with ease and do not become flustered easily. They are graceful people, exciting and dark at the same time.    Contemplative and private, the Snake is not outwardly emotional. He can appear cunning and reticent and works very modestly in the business environment. The Snake will plot and scheme to make certain things turn out exactly as they want them to. They are not great communicators and can become quite possessive when they set their minds on achieving the interest of a partner.    SNAKE FACTS:    People born in the Year of the Snake share certain characteristics. The Snake Sign is an abbreviated way of characterizing that individuals personality. Following are features associated with the Sign of the Snake.    Sixth in order, Chinese nameSHE, sign of the sagacity    Hour9am-10:59am MonthMay    Western CounterpartTaurus    CHARACTERISTICS    Acute, Aware, Cunning, Proud, Vain, Vicious    TAUREAN SNAKE    These Snakes remember everything for they have quite a vivid memory.

Nothing, including myself, is real to me.    That may sound funny, but the disorder has totally destroyed my life, and my ability to enjoy what life has to offer. I go through life in a permanent daze, faking normality by watching how others behave.     Imagine waking up very groggy and not being able to clear your head. Or, better yet, imagine you're dreaming and woke up, only to find you're still dreaming. Then, no matter how hard you try, you cannot wake up, but slip from one dream state to another.     That's a very small fraction of what this feels like.    I would not wish the feeling inside my head on anyone.|`|r63QC6Svaa	I'm too nice to be on the Real World.

fedff847580ea2687d3b8a79324cf69baa	L'amore  passione, ossessione, qualcuno senza cui non vivi, io ti dico: buttati a capofitto, trova qualcuno da amare alla follia che ti ami alla stessa maniera. Come trovarlo? Beh, dimentica il cervello e ascolta il tuo cuore. Io non sento il tuo cuore, perch la verit, tesoro,  che non ha senso vivere se manca questo. Fare il viaggio e non innamorarsi profondamente, beh, equivale a non vivere. Ma devi tentare, perch se non hai mai tentato, non hai mai vissuto.Riferimento: "Ho voglia di te", Ed. Feltrinelli, 2006    Film: Ho voglia di te / HVDT (2007)-Anche nel mio cuore  scritto che: ho voglia di te...    Film: Ho voglia di te / HVDT (2007)-E le cose pi stupide quando sei innamorato te le ricordi come le pi belle, perch la loro semplicit non ha paragoni.    Film: Ho voglia di te / HVDT (2007)-Nessuno fa caso all'acqua che evapora dopo le piogge, quando torna il sole, poco importa se in quell'acqua ci sono anche le lacrime spese a piangere per amore, per dolore. L'acqua evapora torna nell'aria e torna nei nostri polmoni, respirando il vento che ci investe il viso, e le lacrime tornano dentro di noi, come le cose che abbiamo perso; ma nulla si perde davvero. Ogni secondo che passa ogni luna che sorge non fanno altro che dirti "vivi, vivi e ama quello che sei comunque tu sia, ovunque tu sia. Guarda in alto verso il sole, chiudi gli occhi e non stancarti mai di sognare"   la vita  troppo breve per non essere felici... insieme.    Film: Ho voglia di te / HVDT (2007)-... e sono felice, come non ero da tanto... colpevole solo di quella scritta. Immensa. Su tutto il suo palazzo di fronte. Splendida diretta, vera. E ora non ho pi dubbi. Non ho rimorsi, non ho pi ombre. Non ho peccato, non ho pi passato. Ho solo una grande voglia di ricominciare. E di essere felice. Con te gin. Sono sicuro. S,  proprio cos.

ee85856e6d6732acdacae165fbd0ca7aaa	I bought Gwen's albums, being a hardcore No Doubt Fan for over 10 years, and I tell you I wasn't that impressed, Gwen's best work lies in No Doubt. I can't wait for the new album coming out soon. Goos riddance to hearding "hollaback girl" for the millionth time!|`|AA11478999	Thank You!    Another person with good music taste you are.    I never was a hard core No Doubt fan, but "Don't Speak" was a good tune back in its day.  I couldn't believe Gwen Stefani sold out to the pop/dance scene she's in now.  It's like the people who know her as Gwen Stefani don't even know she was in a Rock band and that band did a decent job.    That was truly a stupid move for her.  She has more competition now than before.  Let's recall what she was truly up against back then: The Cranberries, Hole, Kittie maybe, and now as a good competitor would be Evanescence.  Truly disapointing to shift to that section of music.|`|AA11242216	pretty much|`|a8d51c03a7b215069dc6456524a37741aa	I loved No Doubt but I also love Gewen's new music!

I don't know what she is even trying to do with that crap. I dont really listen to her new stuff. She probably has totally different fans as a solo artist and Im not one of them. I love NO Doubt to the end.|`|AA10813562	It's exactly that: crap!  I was never a hard core fan, either, but they had a good, solid sound.  It was different, completely identifiable as "theirs."    Sadly, Gwen Stefani has made a terrible change: from ska-flavored-punk-rock girlie to hip-hop-wannabe-bad-girl, and sacrificed her band-mates for solo-act mediocrity in the process.

HfjJtBPbaa	Con todo respeto a la persona que opino antes, creo que el karma tiene nada que ver con esoterismo.     El Karma es aquella ley que ajusta sabia e inteligentemente  el efecto a su causa. Es decir, todo lo bueno o malo que hemos hecho en una vida, nos traer consecuencias buenas o malas para sta o prximas existencias.    Un ejemplo de Karma lo puedes ver cuando se repiten en tus hijos, actitudes negativas de tu juventud y por las cuales tus padres sufrieron, pues ahora te tocara a ti buscar la manera de solventar ese karma, por que si no lo haces, te perseguira a travs de todas tus vidas.

Positivo o Negativo.    *Generar  Lo que generas en tu entorno puede ser positivo o negativo, tus acciones definen lo bueno y malo que has hecho eso es lo que tu estas generando. (cosas buenas o malas)    *Observar  Analizar tus acciones te permite corregirlas para tratar de hacer el bien. Si heriste a alguien, tienes que observar objetivamente que fue lo que hiciste o dijiste para hacer sentir mal a alguien. Esto tambin es positivo o negativo y depende de unos mismo corregir nuestros errores.    *Destruir  Eliminar de nuestra vida las cosas malas, podemos ser destructivos y eso equivale a negativo o podemos destruir lo que hemos hecho mal y eso es positivo.    En pocas palabras el Karma es el circulo que nos cobra lo malo o retribuye lo bueno y nosotros somos los nicos responsables de nuestro destino al actuar correcta o incorrectamente.  Lo que generas|`|WFIkRvNHaa	el Karma es la Ley de la Causa y del Efecto.  Partimos del hecho de la Evolucin y la Reencarnacin. Si yo te pregunto... quien eres...? que respuesta me das...? Soy Tal persona, vivo en tal lado, tengo tal nivel educacional o econmico, tengo hijos, familia, amigos etc... pero esa respuesta no responde la pregunta. En todos los idiomas conocidos cuando se habla del YO se coloca fuera del cuerpo, de la mente, del espritu.Ese YO es una energa vital, nica, unida a todo el universo porque todo lo que existe est relacionado entre s y ese YO pertenece al Universo Csmico de la misma manera que una gota de agua pertenece al ocano.  Ahora bien, en cada vida, esa energa que ahora late en un cuerpo procede de otros cuerpos en los que tambin se manifest, para aprender, para conocer, para vivir y disfrutar.  En el transcurso de nuestras vidas vamos haciendo cosas buenas y cosas malas. Ahora bien ?que es lo bueno y que es lo malo? Si nos fijamos en las leyes de los pases nos equivocaramos porque para lo que es bueno en unos lados es malo en otros y as tambin en la historia de la humanidad. Sin embargo, el conocimiento superior nos ense?a que BUENO es todo aquello que nos ayuda a avanzar espiritualmente, a evolucionar positivamente, a ascender en la escala de la evolucin a ser cada da mejores seres humanos, a lograr con nuestras acciones, pensamientos y vida subir un escaloncito ms en la etapa hacia la perfeccin y la unin con el Absoluto de donde procedemos. Malo es aquello que nos retarda la evolucin, que nos estanca, que nos perjudica a nosotros y a los dems, incluso al ambiente, a los animales, las plantas a todo lo que entramos en contacto.  A medida que vamos aprendiendo y avanzando espiritualmente nos percatamos de esta gran Verdad y entendemos que cada persona, en una etapa determinada est viviendo lo que en esa etapa tiene que vivir segn todo aquello BUENO que haya acumulado en su KARMA (o sea, a lo largo de vidas pasadas) y por tanto tambin viene a cumplir o recibir el pago de acciones MALAS realizadas en el pasado (aquellas que en esta u otras vidas hayan perjudicado su evolucin o la de los dems). Como se ve no se trata de un castigo de Dios ni de nada injusto sino simplemente de recibir el efecto de una causa.  La Ley del Karma es una de las verdades ms antiguas que se conoce y ha sido revelada a la humanidad por los Grandes Maestros y las Grandes Almas que han vivido a lo largo de la historia, desde tiempos muy remotos, desde Buda y Krishna, Lao Tse y Confucio, Platn y Scrates, el mismo Jesucristo lo predic en muchas ense?anzas, inclusive en Mateo 17 admite a sus discpulos que Juan el Bautista es la reencarnacin de Elas el profeta.  La Ley del Karma es la Ley de la Justicia Divina, de las oportunidades... cuando hacemos algo positivo, bueno en el sentido universal (no porque est escrito en una constitucin o una ley, sino porque sea bueno por naturaleza ya que hay leyes injustas) entonces estamos generando buen Karma de lo contrario atraemos mal Karma.|`|0f45bb07fe53780e104fd314fecf6871aa	tienes que comprar una biblia y leerla,alli Dios te explica muchas cosas de la vida.que debes aprender,los demas libros existentes en el mundo,no podran jamas compararse a la palabra de Dios.ni te daran mejor consejo,ati ni a nadie en esta umanidad.esta escrito que viva el hombre una bes y despues el juicio.Lo demas son todos versos,y mentiras que satan desparramo por el mundo,por lo cual muchos espiritus inmundos han salido para enga?ar si es posible,a los escojidos de Dios|`|7LLJILkhaa	Se puede decir que si!!!

En la biblia dice: Con la vara que mides seras medido (todo lo que haces se te regresa)  En el paganismo dice: Haz lo que quieras, a nadie da?es (todo lo que haces se te regresa)  En el budismo dice: El bien y el mal estan equilibrados (todo lo que haces se te regresa)  En la ciencia dice: Toda accion corresponde a una reaccion igual y en sentido opuesto (todo lo que haces se te regresa)    Conclusion: Es una ley natural, existe. punto.

c7Rj1Rs7aa	Olha, vou dizer a vces uma coisa - nem todo rabe mulcumano vive assim. Acho q dizer - q todo brasileiro  ladr?o e vive sambando em orgias sexuais -  um grande esteritipo.... O mesmo q dizer que todo mulculmano  terrorista - isso  uma grande INJUSTI?A E MENTIRA. Grupos minoritrios existem em qualquer lugar. Quando falo q sou do Rio p quem n?o conhece o Rio, logo imaginam um monte de favelas, tiroteio e sangue p tudo quanto   lado. Acho q sua coloca??o t falando sobre os radicais e em qualquer religi?o tem radicais. Imagine o Papa dizer q n?o tem q usar camisinha no sexo e um monte de meninos e meninas passando hiv um p outro? E olhe q sou catlico e n?o gosto dessas idias ultrapassadas do Papa.  Ent?o, retornando ao assunto, toda pessoa muito ligada a religi?o pode ser facilmente vtima de grupos perigosos que defendem interesses ligados ao poder - e podem ser vtimas dos maiores golpes - pq perder a prpria vida  um grande golpe - ainda mais q quem vai usufruir do poder n?o ser quem vai morrer, mas quem ficar mandando os outros morrerem no lugar dele. Em resumo - fa?a o q mando mas n?o fa?a o q fa?o -  o que pregam os lderes e eles sempre estar?o por ai lavando a cabe?a de adeptos no mundo.... Mas existem mulcumanos maravilhosos e em Deus e nada tm a ver com terroristas, ao contrrio, s?o vtimas dessa situa??o e n?o criemos esteritipos com pessoas que como ns tem cren?a no bem maior do universo que se chama  Alah ou Deus, mas sim os respeitemos acima de tudo como manda a Lei l em cima.|`|84c48d7e25f7ee832c2eb2ec535a474caa	at eu !  fala serio!

I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but... uh... comic book characters can be any age that the writer wants them to be.  Hence the Dark Knight Returns comes out in the same era as Batman: Year One.  If there's a problem with Batman, then it's the writers who need to be replaced, not Bruce Wayne.|`|a4a6534060f746d3f54f22e966e03370aa	I'd like to see Nightwing succeeding to Batman.

c9b4ca7b22046c9321fd9628d63ed27eaa	Beyonce Knowles....she has curves women pay top money to get...fashionable..(at times)...on the cover of many top magazines but still will never reach ICON status.  The girl has a pretty face and great PR people working behind her.  But if they took that all away what would be left?  Let's face it...her voice will never compare with Jennifer Hudson or other women who have become icons.   Beyonce is in a totally different league than Diana Ross.  She has also said that she wants to win an Oscar...not really sure if that is going to happen either.  Her performance in 'Dreamgirls' was fairly good and I do enjoy listening to her song 'Listen'.  But its going to take a hope and a prayer if she wants to become an icon like artists from the 50's-80's.  When I think of icons I think of Madonna and Patti LaBelle.  I hate how artists these days are just copying what these artists did.|`|FomIa9jQaa	yes i do think...|`|AA11443409	Nah, i don't understand why she is popular. she's not that charismatic. She sells records because she has good marketers.|`|AA11549305	HELL NO will she be another Michael Jackson. She doesn't have that much talent.    Keep on dreamin Beyonce!|`|d5c3ecd2bb3d43f8d0acc6c55b54ffd1aa	Perhaps, since the consumers are buying into her music and looks. She really has no outstanding talent. She is like a karaoke bar fly. If all consumers stop buying into her PR campaign, she will fade away.|`|zgNjpPOpaa	Well, yes, i think she will be an icon, because she's a very talented singer and actor. Yes, she cannot be like Diana Ross or Tina Turner, because they are the ones who really gave the whole audience a BIG hit. But, you know, nowadays, people get tired of the same people theyre seeing over and over again, and they want new faces too. So, I think, Beyonce just made a really big difference from the past. And, past is past, okay, yes, the singers in the past became a legend, but now, singers are not really copying them, they just idolize them, because they(the singers in the past) are so amazing. You cannot blame them for copying the style of Tina Turner, etc, because, they want to please the new audience too.|`|TTgYXUrsaa	in my opinion, she already is...i mean, not that i agree or disagree  but my father for example doesn't know the name of any pop stars...and one day i was watching the "irreplaceable" video clip and he said :  beyonce is a gorgeous woman  god...if my father knows her name...everybody does. i think nowadays is more about charisma then talent.  some people are famous and are not even talented...they are charismatic. and beyonce definitely is|`|AA11467202	Not really. She doesn't seem to be that original, like you said. Maybe she is now but she will never a legend like Michael Jackson now is.|`|7bP3Yedmaa	HELLZ NAWZZ.. that b itch looks fake. i hate her more because of this now that i know she's also cocky.|`|arpsBMTFaa	Well she cannot sing, so all that is left is her looks and after she takes her hair off, her makeup off and her $50,000 gowns, she will look like a nobody so I guess "no" she will never be close to a "icon" Sorry Beyonce!!!

801655736231e77fc21072b4016b0c8baa	Me gustan mucho las hadas te doy tu signo por la hada de tu signo VA.  TAURO : RASNYSH   El segundo signo del zodiaco, es slido, firme y nada altera su tranquilidad. El Hada que los rige se llama RASNYSH, ella es el Hada especialista en otorgar todo lo que es los placeres, aunque a veces con dureza, una vez que ha tomado su decisin se cruza de brazos, se echa para atrs y ah se queda, no hay quin lo mueva. Aunque l asegura que no es obstinado, sino paciente y sta ya es una cualidad.  Tampoco es cabeza dura, sino firme y sensato y no entiende por qu se le juzga tan injustamente. As es capaz de aguantar meses, a?os. No hay que presionarlo, porque se obstinar, y entonces puede aparecer su furia demoledora. No es comn que esto suceda, pero cuando Tauro se enoja es mejor estar lejos de su camino.  La pasividad es su comportamiento tpico, prefiere recibir a sus amigos en casa que molestarse en ir de visita. Son gente hogare?a, que se relaja en un ambiente cmodo y familiar. El cambio lo altera.    Estrellas de color fucsia para ti.  ESPERO TE GUSTE  salu2|`|HfjJtBPbaa	Yo me case con un Tauro y te puedo decir que no es una persona facil, pero una vez que lo conoces, se aprende a manejar. Son leales y tienen sentimientos muy nobles, pero cuando algo no les va, no hay forma ni manera de convencerlos, adems son rencorosos y posesivos.

Despus de Aries y su primera realizacin del Ser, el nacimiento, Tauro comienza a explorar el mundo en su dimensin fsica. Y por eso, a los de Tauro les resultan muy importantes las posesiones y las sensaciones fsicas. Suelen ser muy sensuales, disfrutan de la buena vida y de los placeres fsicos que encuentran en su camino.    Tauro es el Signo de lo Fsico. Como es el segundo signo, Tauro est regido por la Segunda Casa: La Casa del Dinero y Las Posesiones. El smbolo astrolgico del Tauro es el Toro.    Por eso, como el Toro, los de Tauro trabajan duro, son muy obstinados y ejemplifican la Cualidad Fija que se les asigna. Es el signo de carcter ms fuerte de todo el Zodaco. Cuando de alcanzar metas se trata, la persistencia les ayuda lograrlo todo. Son muy tercos y convincentes. En el Zodaco, Tauro es el opuesto a Escorpio, el Signo de las Posesiones Heredadas; as que, a los que han nacido bajo el signo de Tauro, les interesan sus posesiones personales, y no las ajenas o familiares. Suelen ser avaros y egostas, pero tambin son muy prcticos y estables. Tauro est regido por el planeta Venus. En la antigua Mitologa Romana, Venus (y su equivalente griega, Afrodita), es la Diosa del Amor, la Belleza y el Placer. Representa la alegra y la valoracin de las cosas hermosas. En su faceta negativa, su tendencia a los banquetes y los objetos lujosos pueden conducirlo a excesos, y tambin puede pecar de materialista.    Venus rige a Tauro y Libra. Tauro es el aspecto femenino (la noche); Libra es el masculino (el da). Ambos signos tienen una gran sensibilidad para la belleza: Tauro se enfoca en los objetos bellos, y Libra prefiere concentrarse en la belleza de las personas.    Los que han nacido bajo el signo de Tauro sienten un gran amor por la cultura. Es algo que les ayuda sentirse bien. Muchas veces poseen grandes colecciones de arte, a veces ellos mismos son artistas. Disfrutan de las buenas asociaciones y el casamiento; usan sus encantos y su perseverancia para lograr la armona y la seguridad personal. A veces, su naturaleza leal y romntica es lastimada cuando reciben rdenes.    El Elemento asociado con Tauro es la Tierra. Los signos de Tierra son prcticos: tienden a responder al mundo a travs de mtodos realistas, ms que emocionales. Una de sus mayores habilidades es su constancia y la pericia para alcanzar proyectos que otros abandonan por difciles o aburridos. Los que han nacido bajo el signo de Tauro son muy pacientes y dependientes. Son buenos trabajadores, ambiciosos y serviciales con sus colegas. Por su asociacin con la Tierra les gusta construir cosas y tambin son diestros jardineros. Los Taurinos son personas tranquilas y suelen ser buenos vecinos. La inclinacin por los placeres fsicos pueden convertirlos en personas posesivas y materialistas, pero su naturaleza conservadora los hace precavidos y prcticos, en vez de extravagantes. A veces se enfocan en conseguir una buena posicin social, y pueden parecer egostas. Sin embargo, a pesar de su apariencia testaruda, suelen ser tolerantes y amables, y a veces son dependientes.    Durante el tiempo libre, Tauro disfruta las actividades al aire libre que los acercan a la Tierra. Con frecuencia, disfrutan de las caminatas. Como el Toro, tienden a ser fuertes y musculosos, y les gusta probar su fuerza. Tambin, su gusto por el arte y la cultura los lleva a la pera, las galeras de arte y los circuitos exclusivos.    En cuanto al amor, Tauro es leal, romntico y a veces, celoso. Tauro lo rige el cuello y la garganta. Le gente nacida bajo el signo de Tauro a veces sufre dolores de garganta, tos y problemas de cuello, ms que el resto del Zodaco.    Los colores de Tierra son los colores de Tauro y ejemplifican su naturaleza tranquila.    El Gran Poder de Tauro es su estabilidad y perseverancia. Sus mtodos minuciosos, y su determinacin, los convierten en productivos, an cuando la tarea parece imposible. Son los ms seguros de s mismos del Zodaco.

nxWibYdxaa	"Patrick M le Maudit" est sans conteste le plus gros coup de pied dans la fourmillre du cinma pro-pompeux depuis "qui veut la peau de Roger rabbit !". Tout y est: rotisme implicite, humour graveleux et phmre, argentsale pour mains propres, jeux de mots et clairage lubrique. Patrick M, incarn par un ongle amateur de gaspacho, est saisissant de vrit. Sa femme, la dlicieuse Lolita Paparl est la reine des coquines quant  Gg, le pote homo, il est super marrant.   J'ai vu ce petit bijou  l'autre jour sur la chaine "Turbo et tuning ".

7a69be25d62f7d7243067b0483edf6f5aa	The blonde girl has been living a delusional fantasy for the past few days, and it's her corpse in the shoddy apartment. She shoots herself to avoid the horrors of her worldview which is rapidly disintergrating into chaos. None of the events really happened, except her death.    Notice all the switching realities creating a heightened sense of paranoia and persecution.    The big clue was the Silencio Club, the "theatre of the mind": Basically, it's jumping up and down shrieking "Everything is an illusion!!"    Or at least, that's how I got it. Rotten waste of time, wasn't it?|`|hxhPLSUDaa	I believe that the movie took place over a matter of a fraction of a second or so.  The woman kills herself and while her brain is sputtering out, the electrical impulses stimulate images, which is the majority of the movie.  Much of the movie had nothing to do with reality, while some of her subconcious memories were imbedded in the fantasies.  You can tell that she is dying as the movie begins as it shows the bed coming closer as she is collapsing, while the ending only confirms it.  She was most likely a struggling actress who had delusional aspirations which would explain the general pattern in the visions.|`|48027686b38b72ab5bd5b5a43ef02f6caa	You are normal, the people in this movie are nuts!|`|AA11285961	I served David Lynch as a waiter in Las Vegas.

Abra?o!!!|`|fu9jbbykaa	Johnny Rivers nasceu em New York em 07/11/1942, mas foi criado em Baton Rouge na Lousiana. John Henry Ramistela, mudou seu sobrenome para Rivers por sugest?o do legendrio DJ Alan Freed, quando praticamente se iniciou no mundo da msica. Em Baton Rouge, formou sua prpria Banda "The Spades" composta por amigos da escola, chegando a chamar aten??o local. Determinado a se destacar na msica, gravou alguns singles, mas n?o chegou a alcan?ar destaque.     No incio da dcada de 60, passou a se apresentar em um restaurante de Los Angeles, onde come?ou a fazer sucesso e logo foi contratado pela Casa de Show Whisky a Go Go, onde come?ou sua carreira de sucesso, gravando alguns lbuns ao vivo, coisa rara na poca, sendo o primeiro artista a creditar nas capas de seus discos os nomes dos msicos que o acompanhava.    Seus maiores sucessos aqui no Brasil foram: Do You Wanna Dance?, Its Too Late. Poor Side of Town, Secret Agent Man , Summer Rain , e Baby, I Need Your Lovin.Seu disco mais vendido no mundo e aqui no Brasil foi o lbum Realization gravado em 1968 (segundo colocado em vendagem no ms de setembro - Brasil, ficando atrs somente dos Beatles).     Em 1998 se apresentou em S?o Paulo, no Ibirapuera para 60.000 pessoas. Vendeu cerca de 30 milh?es de discos em todo mundo. Em Janeiro de 2001 saiu seu novo trabalho, um CD gravado ao vivo no Whisky a Go Go "Back At The Wisky", Infelizmente a Soul City Records, sua gravadora n?o tem distribuidora e divulgadora aqui no Brasil, portanto, se voc quiser comprar o novo CD tem que ser pelo seu site oficial.    Johnny Rivers foi o primeiro artista internacional a se apresentar no Canec?o, casa de show do Rio de Janeiro, inaugurada no incio da dcada de 70.   vegetariano por mais de 30 anos.  Eric Clapton, um dos maiores guitarristas do rock, ficou impressionado em ver Johnny Rivers tocar "Secret Agent Man".     Os novos CD`s n?o s?o mais comercializados no Brasil. Sua gravadora a Soul City Records n?o possui distribuidor por aqui.  O cantor Van Morrison considera Johnny Rivers um dos maiores intrpretes de suas msicas.  Johnny Rivers recebeu em 1989 o prmio da Academia de Msica do Estado da Lousiania.  O ator de cinema Stevie MacQueen comparecia sempre aos show`s de Rivers no Whisky A Go Go e escreveu na contra-capa do lbum "In Action" sobre o talento de Rivers.     A Hanna Barbera fez uma homenagem a Johnny Rivers em dezembro de 1964, com um episdio do desenho dos Flistones denominado "Billed as Riverrock - The Stoneage Idol as Rock A Go Go.  Foi o ganhador do Grammy com a produ??o em 1966 do lbum Up Up Away da Banda 5th Dimension.  Em 1998, cerca de 60 mil pessoas compareceram ao seu show na Pra?a da Paz no Ibirapuera em S?o Paulo.  O lbum "Realization" foi o disco mais foi vendido no Brasil.  A msica "Do You Wanna Dance" um dos maiores sucessos dele aqui no Brasil, nos EUA foi apenas uma msica do lbum "Changes", sem o sucesso obtido aqui.  Johnny Rivers se apresentou no Vietnan durante a guerra para os soldados norte-americanos.  A msica "Blue Suede Blues" do lbum "Last Train To Memphis" gravado em 1998, foi uma homenagem a Carl Perkins, seu amigo pessoal, autor da msica "Blue Suede Shoes", falecido em 1998.|`|c7Rj1Rs7aa	Olha, na verdade o nome dele era Jo?o.

Mas nada disso adiante se voce n?o tiver for?a de vontade, confian?a e dedica??o.

eac75caab6258ca8fcef0dc7cb34f6acaa	Had this discussion with a mate the other day.  Oprah is incredible and certainly a fine example of how to be a human being.  But most times I can't watch a whole episode of her show.  Cos as nice as she is, she can be very rude on her show.  So often she asks a really important question to a very knowledgeable guest and when they start to answer she interrupts and makes it all about herself.  This can get very irritating.    But all in all I love her and wish the world had more like her.|`|733da09d0cb9e9d0f08ae79290ca1491aa	Oprah is one mighty powerful lovely lady who deserves all she has &   No she is so not greedy!!   You've seen how much she has given away &   How much she has done for the world &  She is a  such great role model & beautiful to boot|`|ca5daa33358200e47e4f9ca149e3b9e5aa	She is a role model.she has helped many people and gived away lots of money.She brings awareness to lots of things through her talk show and i think she is doing a good job.we certainly need more people like her in our lives.|`|t03VDOkjaa	oprah is great!!|`|4e9c31e55849b7ee208122bf83c428ceaa	She is a great person and a great role model.I idolize her.|`|VYMslG14aa	she is ok far enough she does quite a bit to do with charities and things like that but sometimes she can be a bit over ratted....with all the hype that surrounds her...but that is just my opion...

I love Oprah.|`|epWYKxa2aa	Oprah is good, Black America needs to do for themselves. Being black "all my life" I see too many of "us" looking for handouts. I work full time, full time college student, full time husband, full time parent. I'm making a way for myself and my family. Oprah being an inspiration is more than enough. She showed me that a black woman can be anything that she wants to be in America. Being a young black man, that's motivation enough.|`|AA11049151	yes, she dont owe black america anything. in fact, she dont  owe anybody anything?

a1b618eecf5148f01401e7648a5fe69faa	Yes, I used to think that having my heart broken would never have a positive effect.

It's good to know not every negative experience leads to a negative outcome.|`|qSijgaTraa	Every negative experience I've gone through eventually enables me to help someone that may be going through a similar situation.

I thought girls who talked about sex were sluts, but then i realized that these girls are just human and were just simply more open about sex than i was. maybe i was just jealous that they were able to talk about it and i wasn't. now that I've admitted to liking sex, i talk about it all the time. i even encourage girls to talk about sex. its not fair that guys are able to have sex for fun but girls are only suppose to have sex to show love. girls who call other girls sluts are just putting down their own gender. i feel that if you like sex and want to share it then do it!    of course you should still be smart about it. if youre going to have sex with someone, still use protection and make sure youre absolutely positive that your sex partner doesnt have STD's. other than that, i think its perfectly fine to have sex with whoever you want. girls should also be smart enough to know that sex does not always equal love. sex is a good way to show love but it doesnt always. if a girl is going to have a one night stand, she should know the difference between the two. if both partners agree to have sex, they should both be aware of how the other person is standing with it.|`|c66a871d08314e926aa7ce9d58b07d06aa	Yes i have....|`|601f8cb58fa8578bcb6987894db395f5aa	I tend to put every unknown situation in a negative light, and it usually turns out better than expected.  I guess that's what they call being a pessimist.|`|AA11429639	Yes.|`|LdH6efhmaa	Yes, but I'm still afraid of what it all means....and taking it one day at a time is tearing at my heart, but it's all I can do.

They want that to happen, they are thriving on your pain. You are going to have to rise above this and not let it bother you. It may be hard at first but at least just act like it isn't bothering you. You at least cannot let these people know it is bothering you or they will continue doing what they are doing.    I was once the exact same way you are.

I'm pleased that she's done so well for herself and she is a great role model for everyone.|`|9BO3Aiitaa	I am a little bit tired of her but not much. But that might be because she isn't a nasty person who is all out to destroy people, but she needs to calm it down just a little bit before less patient people see her on telly and start hurling blunt objects though the screen. lol!

I have, however, known couples named Patrick & Patricia, Kris & Chris and Billy and Billie.  That would be way too confusing in my view.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	lol well i have a girl name so I dont think I would .. if it was a mutual name for a boy/girl yea.. like Marley..|`|8SsER8qIaa	that would make me a lesbian  my names jessica sooo...|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Well, I've only met one girl named Greta...so the chances of finding a GUY with my name are pretty slim.    But no, that'd be really weird.|`|GRBfQWTxaa	I have a girl name....so definitely N O O O O!|`|46fouwFfaa	Well, my name is strictly female... I don't think there is a male named Layla anywhere.

Why, do you?|`|Yw8X1aXsaa	no, especially because i've never met the people and i would be a little freaked out myself if some person fell in love with me and was practically stalking me on the internet|`|ef86fe99a579a4ed0f59eb5e0225144baa	ahah,  Ohh yeahh  ;D|`|y5dwVEK5aa	oh yeah huney over in horoscopes theres this damn fine tarus man and i say come to mama|`|xu265F7baa	I was tortured for three days and still I did not divulge her name,however it was "The face that launched a Thousand Ships"otherwise I cannot say:>)|`|9it5nGJjaa	Yes, I have a cyber-crush on one of my contacts.

Also Kruder & Dorfmeister... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsW-gBrDq... (yeah definitely the 'K&D' Sessions' album ;)    and for Drum & Bass definitely check out Squarepusher... especially the 'Hard Normal Daddy' album... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1jSqaJJL...    you could also check out DJ's Krush and Shadow for laidback beetz... and also the Psychonauts ace 'Time Machine' which is basically a mix of artists on the 'MoWax' label...

The crew above really came through with some great tunes.  Tricky, Hooverphonic, DJ Shadow are great. I had not heard of the Future Sound Of London but they were great.     Here are a couple I know that were not mentioned:    Avalanches - "Since I Left" - nice beats, brushes, samples, not stop waves of music.  My song linked "A Different Feeling" has nice dreamy beat with Connie Stephens 1950' voice sampled "Tammy's In Love".  Man that absolutely great.  The perfect sound bite, anyway the whole album has those classic nuances.      Amon Tobin - "Bricolage" - this is trip-hop interladen with Jazz.  This album is a considered a classic in early drum and bass.      http://www.imeem.com/people/PQ6EQkc/blog...    Have a great day!|`|cbZdeOSPaa	Hey, thanks for the new music Pattern Juggler! Sorry I couldn't help :(|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Unfortunately I know two things about the Genre, one is jack and We won't go into the other eh? However I starred it PJ and maybe one a My 200 Contacts will have something for You, I'm sorry I don't.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	Kraak 'n' Smaak, Burial, U.N.K.L.E...|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Morning, PJ!    I'm not a trip hop pro at all, but I've been learning more about these electronic-type groups and I've really been digging what I've been hearing.  So I can't give you any suggestions other than individual songs, but I guess that's better than nothing.    Sneaker Pimps (I loved this when it was released as a single in the 90s):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJSYzBqA9...    Hooverphonic:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d_b3TtW-...    Mandalay:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie-0hEReV...    And there is my beloved Team Sleep, of course.  Their debut album did have much more in terms of Rock elements than most of these artists do, but it was still a bit of a departure from Chino's work with the Deftones:    Ataraxia:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ogaw5iJ...    Headhunter:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMh8KcWtY...    Our Ride to the Rectory:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU9GDdzM2...    You mentioned some groups that I haven't heard, so I'll be researching those too.  Thanks! :)    Edit: Awesome stuff, migh...I'm liking it a lot!|`|OTFzJbaMaa	what is trip hop can you tell me please?|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Sorry I can't help, honey :(  The only one's I know are Portishead {love 'Glory Box'}, and Massive Attack      Ah... hang on...   I just read that they can both be classed as 'Electronica', so maybe it would be worth your while trying out some Goldfrapp? They have released four albums, each one different from the last.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Vktozqk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWU5mvCfw...    And then there's Delerium. Their early work, 1989 - 1994, is rather different to their post 1994 albums, so if you like them, I'll recommend you a song list :)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOPBC_j6E...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmF-PVAt_...  {these two are *post* 1994, as there is little of the early stuff on YT}      Migh :  I *love* 'Little Fluffy Clouds' :)|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Yeah, I never dove too deep, though I do enjoy what little I have come across. You listed the ones I would have thought of. I will gladly lend a star though.    If anyone notices this sub question, what's the sort of quintessential Tricky record? I like the tracks I've heard, but I've never gotten a record.    There was this comp, not sure if it's really findable, but it was called Pop Fiction: (something) Crime Jazz that was pretty awesome in that vain.    http://www.amazon.com/Pop-Fiction-New-Cr...    (scratch the Alex Reece thing, I just refreshed my memory on what his stuff sounds like and as much as I find it enjoyable it has no place in this conversation. I remembered it being much less "bright" than it is).    ***************  Thanks PJ. I'm gonna have a look. Thanks for bringing out the question too. This question actually reminded me that I meant to get something of his a while back.    **************  Thanks for linking up the Tricky song. I liked it, sounds like a good direction to go in.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I've never delved too far into this genre, although I do like Portishead, and I went on a short Massive Attack kick years ago.    Would Future Sound of London be considered Trip-Hop?     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Soun...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVpWQcLZz...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lLWHfyG1...    EDIT: I forgot about Spiritualized! I used to like them, too. Again, not sure if they're Trip-Hop, but in my mind, they were always in the same realm with bands like Portishead, so maybe ...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualiz...    My YouTube connection is going nuts, but here's a link to one of their better-known songs:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWAKmzahi...|`|wEpwWVhJaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj6yXxVc2...

ipqWxJyGaa	It`s a shame that thing like that gets reported. The important thing is that we all understand one another here, spend time asking and answering, helping one another, having fun... English isn`t my mother tongue , so what if I make a grammar mistake, as long as you understand me? My advice - ignore such comments.    I`ve checked, you are right.

Next week on the Wednesday show is when they will unveil who made the cut into the Top 36 and who didn't.|`|8Y9EogN0aa	the Info on the next weeks episode says they pick the Top 36, so i would think its safe to say the live performances start in 2 weeks :)       Ashley: appearently you are not up to date. American Idol has made the  change that there is no longer a Top 24, now there is a Top 36. and it is official :)|`|sqPoFZ00aa	It goes live once the judges pick the Top 24.|`|1TXJDiedaa	Once they pick the top 36 contestants.

UdwIaCxBaa	In the 1960s the American Government did tests where they applied alcohol to skunks to see what effect it would have on them. The skunks became aggressive, having promiscuous sex and it became evident from these experiments that skunks could not handle their drink. The experiments were shut down in the early 70s after a fight broke out and bar stools were broken over another skunk's head.  It was a sad, sad day for the world of science.    : (|`|5e6S1JqWaa	cause it rhymes|`|y6406A92aa	Umm, it rhymes ...? lol|`|PzmLYUe6aa	it rhymes|`|AA11656632	Cause it's easy to say when you're drunk|`|RsYwCOeFaa	because it rhymes of course!  or maybe skunks are alcohol addicts|`|B7WIZdglaa	"dumb as a box of rocks" ... yet how many boxes of dumb rocks have you actually seen?

At least that's the way I see it. :o)|`|j5k0VRbPaa	umm nv headr of it|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	I think it comes from that skunks are known to get rabies quite frequently.

l95ndpTWaa	I'm a classically trained guitarist.   Some of my favourite songs to play (on both electrical and classical guitars) are here:    Bach's 'Allemande' (from Suite No. 1, BWV 1007 - originally for cello) is a nice tune, played a lot easier with a drop D tuning.    'Sicilienne' by Gabrial Faure/Gluklikh is another one I enjoy.  There are a few traditional Russian folk songs that are fun.  Basically, any of the songs found in this book I'd recommend taking and altering a bit for electric guitar:    http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Guitar-A...    Malenguena is a fun, flamenco-infused tune that many people have taken up (including Dick Dale and Brian Setzer) on electric.    There is a really good transcription of 'Tarantelle' by Coste in this book (which also has some fantastic transcriptions that are easily adapted to electric guitar):  http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Classical...    Lodovico Roncalli's "Gavotte" can be elaborated on.    I like to use Dionisio Aguado's 'Estudio' as a light backing piece while overlaying a few electric riffs over top if it.  It gives it a nice effect.    Another book you may want to consider would be this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Classical-Gui...    Even though it's termed as being "EASY," if you've got a good grasp of improv and adaptation, it will provide a few awesome bases for killer songs.|`|MMhbxSHcaa	Mozart's symphonies?

He could no longer been my friend if he cheated.|`|43JgLpkKaa	there would be a divorce in the works !!|`|LSNffo4jaa	I would be hysterical!!!|`|zqOnNF2Gaa	I would ask them to move over...three is better than 2.|`|MciMh30Jaa	Get a gun and shoot them to make sure im not dreaming and if their dead and im not dreaming i've got a legal situation on my hands lol|`|iqw0k3Mlaa	Well I'm a man & if I came home to find my wife in bed with another woman I would be delighted & try to join in:)|`|xuGwAlksaa	idk....but actually...my guy has been actin really weird...i'm kinda scared to go home early cause i'm scared i mite find jus that|`|AA11713693	I would kick him to the kirb.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	they both would not be alive

But a scorpion?!!? I would jump out of bed so fast the scorpion would scream in shock. We'd both be passed out for a few minutes just to wake up and go through it again.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	I would pack it in a box and put it in my bosses office at work. :P|`|HUy7ugDUaa	probably stain the sheets then move away a fast as i could.|`|Ju8PJZsraa	a real one- (big) think: well they say the big ones are the least of your worries (small) think: ah crap.....  do: quickly flip the blanket or myself, roll out of bed and run into the kitchen where i will grab a broom and prepare for war (or if im feeling up to it, get a jar and catch it ^^ scorpion's are pretty neat)|`|ObxU6FVmaa	Flick it off and start screaming/crying
FycEnv5haa	omgz. i made loadssssss of those. theres like a whole bag load in my cupboard. i remember all the kids at school were obsessed. xD  :)|`|kGsk9edeaa	yeah they were the craze a few years ago and i loved them!  i used to always do them on long car journeys and i loved making up my own patterns.  oh dear i was a bit of a scoubidou addict...|`|c7ad7b42e9c7f9eddfdacceddd9f9287aa	oh i've done those when i was a kid, but now i've forgotten|`|AA11510511	I could never get into them.  but my kids went through a phase of making loads of stuff.|`|la9zji2Uaa	I know what you mean. Never done it myself but my friends kids have - they look cool. x|`|TZiySTOGaa	yes there was a big hype on them about 3 years ago i did hundreds of them with my daughter!!
4BBjhHAnaa	Plot device, Mr. Frodo, plot device.  (Sorry, that's a joke from some flash cartoon)    I don't think it would work to grab on to a person, especially not one of the Others.  I think that's one of those things that can't happen if it didn't happen.    Also, it makes sense that the boat would come-- otherwise how would they have clothes?  Or how would Sawyer have that gun?  And what about the compass Richard gave Locke?      As for Jin . . . I KNEW that they wouldn't really kill him!!!!  I am really excited to see what we might learn about Rousseau!|`|ylh8dRokaa	I was thinking the EXACT same thing when I saw this. Maybe it has something to do with... whatever you are physically touching or holding, time warps right along with you. Maybe Locke realizes this now and if he sees Richard again, will physically grab ahold of him to take him along.  Jin being alive completely MADE the entire episode for me. After I saw him alive... nothing else mattered. lol  And I loved his face when Rousseau said her name. He must be thinking like "WTF is going on?" haha|`|gu3GAFC9aa	Yeah that is weird! I am so glad for Jin!!!|`|AA10954273	As Faraday pointed out earlier, anything they're touching goes with them.  This is why Sawyer's shirt didn't disappear and the bullet in John's leg didn't disappear.   I'm not sure this would work with people or anything living, though.  It might make the island send the smoke monster after them to prevent further attempts at cheating.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	whatever they have with them when the light flashes, goes with then.  the bullet in locke's leg.  the compass richard gave to locke.    so yeah, locke should just hold on to richard next time.  but maybe richard isn't supposed to be with them.  maybe he can't.  only material things.|`|AA11016425	I know, right?!?!  I was thinking they would just be floating in the water after the flash.  I look forward to learning Jin's survival story.|`|D0vv2HSAaa	I was thinking the same thing about the boat but I guess it stayed with them because they were in it.  Last nights episode was awesome, especially when the french people pulled Jin out of the water!!! I was shocked when the young pregnant girl said her name was Danielle Rousseau. That blew me away!!!  Great show, keep watching!!|`|3UL23OlVaa	Maybe if John Locke grabs on to Richard just like you suggest he will only get Richard's clothes and Richard would end up ... well ... umm ... just like the other Richard (remember him in Palau?). I'm wondering how Jin got affected by the time-shift when he was farther away from the island than Frank's helicopter when the island vanished -- maybe an erratic radiation wave?|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	I KNOW! That's driving me crazy!! I was thinking "they better hope that there isn't a flash while they're in the middle of the ocean cuz that boat's gonna disappear!"  and DEAR GOD YES! I knew that Jin couldn't be dead! Sun is gonna be SO happy! And as for Danielle, well that was just weird! So apparently that last flash took them back 16 years to when Danielle first got on the island

We barely had to wear clothes to ride bikes when I was growing up!|`|vRmsvSb6aa	Haha I know. When I was a kid there was no such thing as a bike helmet. Thank god for stitches.|`|NcNxIsynaa	No helmet wearer here darlin.....|`|bYWTE40Vaa	We just broke the law   |`|GqDaGHUBaa	I've never had a bike...|`|PMQWI1Ojaa	We didn't even have carseats!

She said you better go play some more and quit bothering me ...so moral of the story is, a helmet wouldnt have done shiit to protect me|`|5DJcir9saa	I'm 27 and we never wore helmets, knee pads, or any of that crap.  We were a tougher generation...LOL    But I seriously did hear that they were trying to make it a law that kids have to wear helmets when sledding-WTF??|`|Hw3n0nenaa	No but i "borrowed" my brothers baseball cards for my spokes.|`|AA11538538	Nope...I would have been pulled off of my bike and beaten...|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Nope.

We ate leftover cake and brownie batter too.    Ah, the good old days 
WoA4MDj1aa	Yeah, I do.  And it is so not right.  It is supposed to be an INCOME tax so regardless of deductions and loopholes and other gimmicks how can you get more than you pay in?  I know people who get 6, 8 thousand dollars a year "back" because of kids so that perpetuates the baby factory syndrome and the rest of us get to pay for it.  They, of course, beleieve there is nothing wrong with this, I would hang my head in shame.    Ha ha! Don't hate the baby factories.  Finally figured it out after 6!? (Forehead smack) Way to work the system.  Just like another poster said it is welfare; did you ever say, "No, this isn't right, I can't take this away from everyone else."    Review your first four lines and tell me what you sound like.  Or maybe it will take you another several years to figure that one out, too.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	yes, its nuts, but true. i might as well be writing a check to them.     we should go to that China one child policy.|`|5M0yL2G9aa	i do|`|AA11894434	I got screwed I paid an accountant $500 so I only had to pay in $15. I am really glad  it is going to little kids who can use it.  BTW I think my accountant screwed me. I need more back.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I have every year.|`|DS3QXmTBaa	yeah.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	I call it a purchased voter ?    I dont fault any of you who do - but I fault a system that is paying you to vote for them and keeping you down to suit their goals    --- AsUWish - lets have that cup of coffee!|`|M7W7lZBBaa	Umm, I got over 6 grand back    almost 2 grand- child tax credit gets you 1,000 per child. I have 4 so that would be why it was such a big amount|`|lC5NLsZZaa	I nevar have that problem. I'm a Kalifornia milk cow.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	i got almost 7 grand back|`|IizPFrELaa	*hides*    They're called tax deductions not babby's!    Edit: Wishy I got you beat! I got 9K back this year!    I have 5 little tax deductions here at home and 1 in college.    Edit: I take offense at being called a "baby factory machine" I never even wanted babb'ys!    My BC failed me 5 times, resulting in 6 babby's twins were my last and final, finally figured out what caused it, and quit having it!    I have NEVER lived off welfare with any of my kids, and thankfully never will!  Its not MY fault or my KIDS fault that the goverment has these "loopholes" as you put it!    My husband also pays in "extra" each pay day so that we can have a nice return to spend on the kids etc...I AM A REAL TAX PAYER!    Edit: Take WHAT away from everyone else?    I can afford my babies! And work very hard at keeping a nice home etc.. for them I may not work "outside" the home but that does not mean I'm "working the system", to me that is someone that keeps on popping them out and continues to live on welfare!|`|Zky0yJqCaa	ummmmm....... I do.|`|FkhFIIsjaa	My refund consisted of $30.98, eight smoked sausages and a Barbie Dream House, complete with a naked Ken doll drinking a beer.  I am pretty happy with that.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	No one, or almost no one does. The republican idea that people are getting a bigger refund than they paid in excludes payroll taxes such as social security and medicare. You don't get a refund on those, so you most certianly pay in more then you get back...republicans just hate poor people.|`|9xnwKZ3yaa	Let me tell you a story: I got a piece of @ss 31 years ago & haven't gotten a tax return since. Long story.

The amount u deposit as income tax in bank, if it is refunded wholly to u then it becomes refund. When u get payment from any person which is above Rs.20,000 by one cheque at a time or if the payment is above Rs.50,000 annually then that person deduct some amount from the payment. That deduction is known as TDS i.e. TAX DEDUCTED AT SOURCE.       If u r getting the whole amount back as refund which u have deposited in bank as income tax then this TDS is also included in that refund and u will get more refund through government.

My daughter loves her father, but she doesn't remember how he used to literally push her away from him when he was on his computer game. She doesn't remember how he used to push me around and throw things and threaten me at all hours of the night while I held her in my arms as I cried and screamed...that's why I have an order of protection against him, but I wasn't allowed to keep him from her visitation-wise...I don't like the way she acts like him (not in the good ways) or the things he shows her that are so inappropriate for her age (she's 3 and he had her watch Hellboy!)...it worries me that she's starting to become more like him, using physical means to convey her anger, etc.     My last exboyfriend may have been a jerk to me, but he is an amazing father to 3 girls from what I heard on the phone.

ONLY if they are in a good relationship with them and are not manipulating or twisting their kids to hate the other parent. Men teach children how a man and woman are in relationship with each other, and with other men.  When one parent is absent the child is missing half of there growing up years which influence who they are to become.|`|tVsnOKrFaa	No way dude babies need a stable household,which is a mother and father.
oVxr5B3Eaa	Downtown one night, there is this really popular pizza place ... and we called a cab from there.. huge crowd outside.. Like HUGE..,. likely 40 people or so... cab came... The bar had given us free shutter shades ... and I dropped them... under the cab.. And with my little short dress I pretty much dove under the cab for them... and EVERYONE saw my booty... My friend tried to dive infront of me... I don't know who ACTUALLY saw but man.. that was a bad idea..|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...

Sweet potatoes are pretty healthy though.|`|XDfrSfrvaa	yes, if u eat lots of it|`|Vh9P5P60aa	No, potatoes are an excellent source of potassium...|`|ifcgmNV3aa	than explains it all :D belly bummy potatoz fatz..

Ju8PJZsraa	I don't want marriage because I don't want to be tied down. But i DO NOT want kids. I like to avoid pain, not to mention just thinking of raising someone and making big decisions that can affect their life too....that's a scary thought.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	I did feel that once, now I am married and very happy|`|Qw4l9R68aa	I hope so but I just don't know.|`|NpT5hbgMaa	I'll for surely get married but as for kids...    not for another 10 years at least.

If I'm honest, I'm not overly bothered about marriage, and like you, the thought of kids scares me. Plus, I keep getting my heart broken, seems like I'm destined to be alone.|`|fy8YNH7jaa	i've been engaged for 5years and i dont think am ever going to get married the other half not interested|`|SpOB3HlCaa	ME! I am just so self conscious that I don't even bother trying to chat people up anymore. I'm afraid that I'll die lonely, but for some reason I think that the fear won't set in until it's too late.|`|rVDyWMVsaa	OH NO,to late ,I`ve already done it!!!.|`|AA11656797	I know I'm never gonna get married and have kids.|`|4828055c01f78313c97a03a0ba021859aa	Well, I did think that.  I never wanted to get married and have kids particularly.  I'm still not sure what happened!    I suppose I met someone I like being with - it's that simple.  Perhaps you haven't met anyone you really like yet.  Maybe you will, maybe you won'tl - but if you like where you are now, then it doesn't really matter, does it?
Qbczt3ivaa	no, I think your eyes close automatically.

Bet'cha didnt know that!  Yeah :)|`|8nm2psyKaa	No its not so my theory is that if you feel like you have to sneeze hold your eyes open and that'll prevent you from sneezing lol|`|63c46881d0aa0376d34c1858ee0f160faa	nope don't no any one that can ant going to happen|`|i3S10DUqaa	I actually succeeded in doing that once, and my eyes stayed in their sockets and everything.  ^.^|`|I2wqc5rBaa	I heard that if you do your eyes will pop out|`|OwdoUJuRaa	I'm too scared to try o_o|`|jWl7Zi1Uaa	Yeah.

87yovKYlaa	ha ha. single girls always get attached after a few weeks of sex. if you are wanting just booty you best find a married woman who isn't happy at home sexually but stays with him and won't leave him for nothing. that's the only way you will ever have a sex only relationship...well that or hookers.|`|Q9cQY8Tkaa	well iam a chick  but i can help you out just tell her that you like her but your just kinda attached to me that much and you need to slow it down a bit and i think you really nice and all but maybe we should take this a bit at a time and if we like each other really well and make this all work out and ask her if she can just back the attrached and attachedment down a bit cause you want this to work out really well  hope this helps you alot|`|RtJ11zUZaa	It doesn't sound like you're "seeing" her, it sounds like you're SEEING her.    It's time to either buy the cow or get the milk from someone else.  You had a nice run for a while there...|`|pqOLekE7aa	I am not an expert or have much experience...but i would say that if you don't have the same feelings for her and just want to keep "seeing" her, then i would just tell her how you feel and that you don't want anything more than what you guys are doing now. It would seem to me that she is getting more attached/liking you more, thats just me though. i don't know if this was any help at all. I wish the best of luck to you!|`|vQG6fDFeaa	Think about how you feel about her.. if u want to be serious with her or not! this is what she is wanting now. She knew what it was before and now she has feelings that grew. Eventually she will want to "be with you" and will cause problems if u continue seeing her this way only! Good luck|`|aY40cuPZaa	ever head of p.w.?  my wife came in to my apt. and saw the posters all around.  some of funny things, and some w/ women.  all hash, hash.  we don't live together.  she said no.  we said the "i do" to each other.  now, after the, "i do," my things came off the wall, and now my place is carotid w/ stuff that she makes.  p.w.=pussy whipped        don't get no roung idea over what i said.  try it out.  women alwas has their hands on our dick, but how far can they go were out it?|`|RALliiZTaa	if seeing means dating then that's what the both of you are doing. do you have any feelings for her? if so talk with her and find out what she wants and what you want. if you have some feelings for her and think you are not the one for her then you might have to break up with her. its not easy for the both of you but do you want to hurt her in the long run by not breaking up with her with stuff you need to do and you are not the one for her? I'm sure you have feelings for her but do what is best for her, even if you have to break up with her. she'll find another man and move on

oMYGtqubaa	The problem is that ETTA INVITED THIS!!!      Once you let somebody as BIG as Beyonce recreate your life on screen... RESING your songs... etc...     she opens the door for Beyonce to make that song part of her 'catalogue'  (because the people will want to hear her do these songs)    If it was SUCH a big deal to Etta... she should've chose an NON-SINGING actress to do the part and have them LIP SYNC her vocals.  Problem solved.    BUT, whether its Beyonce or Jennifer Hudson or even Jamie Foxx... ONCE you let another 'singer' do a song, be prepared for somebody to want to hear the NEW singer sing that song.        I don't think its disrespectful AT ALL.. I think its a TRIBUTE.         I AGREE with Supreme about remakes ....   That Dru Hill remake of "Love's Train" was GREAT...    Intro's remake of "Ribbon In The Sky" is a modern classic of its own......     Jodeci's  "Lately" was GREAT.     Lauryn Hill's  "Killing Me Softly" is a modern classic.    So, I don't believe every remake is automatically "inferior".|`|cjknXzm9aa	i say yes. the reason is because of the new artist sings it and he/she is popular it will do two things: 1) give the original artist royalties and 2) bring attention to the original artist work. a good example of this is between the sheets by the isley brothers, whether that song is sampled or covered they get paid.  btw the way here is another example of a good remake. it was part of a question i recently asked. here it is.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf-OTMzUT...    they do justice to this song.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	No I don't think they should. In many cases, I will go as far as to say I don't think they should be covered, period. To use Sade's words so eloquently "never as good as the first time".     Very rarely have I seen a remake come even close to the original. The last one I can remember is Sara Smile by After 7.|`|Niygpxktaa	I have to disagree.    Often times it is a form of tribute.    After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.      EDIT:  Kev,  did you not like Trina Broussard's remake of Minnie Ripperton's "Inside My Love"?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqd0MzSlb...|`|1gcvHPYDaa	It depends. In this particular case, her remaking the song wasnt the issue. The issue to me was The Inauguration. I feel that Ms. James shouldve at least been invited to perform WITH her or at least invite her to sit in the front row. It was Disrespectful IMO.

AA10289523	First Appearance: Tales of Suspense  39   Tony's stark grey armor     Golden Avenger  First Appearance: Tales of Suspense  40   In order to make the armor less frightening to the general public, Stark created a gold-colored version     Red & Gold  First Appearance: Tales of Suspense  48   Stark's trademark red and gold armor arose from a battle with a villain named Mr. Doll, who could control the gold armor     Armors of the 1970s  The armor, including the red and gold color scheme remained largely intact, although non-cosmetic improvements were constantly made, and the suit became stronger and more adaptable in steps. A depolarizing armor, in deactivated mode literally as thin, light and comfortable as woolen underwear, was introduced in  85, but proved too vulnerable and was soon replaced with a more conventional design. Also, for a while the armor sported a Dr.Doom-style nose piece - an adaptation made to make the helmet more comfortable. But it attracted so much ridicule that Stark did away with it on that consideration alone.    Armors of the 1980s  During this period, Stark came to realize there were several situations where his regular model armor, while functional in most environments or situations when necessary, was not wholly appropriate. In response, Stark began to develop numerous specialized suits for special missions.

bgA9wLD0aa	i'm a conservative buyer, so i usually don't buy unless i know i'm going to enjoy most of the tracks.  with classical, i might not like some of the movements as well as others, but i almost always learn to appreciate them after listening a few times.  with popular music, for my favorite bands, i usually like all the tracks; but there are a few that i've bought on the benefit of one or two songs [3 is usually the threshold before i'll buy the cd], and on those, i usually like only one or two of the other songs.  i haven't bought any rock in ages.  i've completely lost touch with that scene.  then, i don't know enough about folk musicians to trust myself to pick something i'd like.    when i put on music these days, 99% of the time, it's going to be classical.  so, i really appreciate the links you post.|`|EVYSvkIraa	usually i like all the songs|`|QLMW7HRMaa	0-1|`|vmv1rP76aa	I tend to like anywhere from 3 to 5 of the tracks, generally speaking, but some bands I like all the songs.     I usually listen to goth-symphonic rock (Within Temptation, Nightwish, Echoes of Eternity), black metal (Moonspell, Kamelot), and, because of my upbringing, freestyle (Judy Torres, TKA, George Lamond).|`|yyIVrngcaa	at most 2, but usually one. sad i know :/|`|V52z8kEdaa	i like all song|`|qJbcIrKeaa	When I was younger I only bought a CD if I first heard the song on the radio and thought it good. Then I'd only listen to that one song on the CD. I would listen to all of the songs when I'd first get the CD to see if the others were any good but I'd always end up just listening to that one song every time I put in the CD afterward.    Now that I'm older I don't listen to the radio at all. The shock jocks have become too annoying... I never thought I'd say that... I must be getting old... Now the only music I ever buy is soundtracks to movies and TV shows. I have the soundtrack to The Great Raid, one of the greatest war movies ever. And then of course I have a few soundtracks to Doctor Who. And to answer your first question, I tend to listen to all of the songs on the soundtracks.    Why do I listen to the music that I do... hmmm... I listen to soundtracks because I've become tired of all the other music that is out there. It seems like all the songs tend to have the same crap in them. Atleast soundtracks can be inspirational.    How did I choose to purchase any of that? I heard it first and liked it. I don't buy music if I've never heard it before.|`|30aBTtEMaa	I generally like around eight, though that just means that I enjoy them, not that I really love them. I like rock and a lot of its subcategories. I mostly get music from the computer now, but when I bought cd's I chose them if I really liked at least two songs on it and it was a genre where it was probable that I would like more, and I respected the band enough to be happy having their cd.|`|AA11690436	Tracks on a cd is sooo 1990s.

mp0OoSYgaa	YES!     Gold is not shiny, it does not reflect in the sunlight. It is gold in color, and dull.Gold is heavy, when panning, it will stay at the bottom of the pan and will not float.    Pyrite is not gold color. It is bright, shiny, and yellow color. Pyrite is not heavy.When panning, it moves easily the same as dirt.    A good test to try    Hit it with a hammer, pyrite will shatter like glass (don't ruin a good nugget)Or you can scrap it with your pocketknife, if it's gold, it will scratch, if it's pyrite, it will flake off.|`|bn7KciIeaa	I sure can.

I NEED SOME MORE GOOFY MICHAEL JACKSON QUESTIONS, LIKE THE ONE ABOUT THE WOOD HAHA.  AND THEY SOMETIMES HATE THE HATERS BECAUSE THEY HATE THEIR HERO, GOD, LOVE! BUT THEN AGAIN WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE HATE ON MICHAEL JACKSON FANS?  WELL I WILL NEVER KNOW,,  LOVE YAH XX|`|pT514qPUaa	'Cos they're his fans. They will support him.   Because they know that MJ is innocent.  Because they know MJ is OK.  And they don't like haters' ways. Haters just want to destroy his life. LIKE YOU..!!  You're the weirdest hater in the world. You hate him but you like to asking questions about him.   People hate MJ's haters 'cos they know that haters are stupid. Haters do not know how great Michael Jackson is.            ENOUGH..??|`|JBW7cE0Caa	i don't hate on them, out loud at least. the only time i'd hate on them is if they hated on me for being a fan of michael's first. that's when i fire back.|`|cRhkkBAEaa	Michael Jackson Fans do not like Michael Jackson haters who know the truth and yet refuse to believe it.     Michael Jackson fans feel sorry for people who do not know the truth coz they are missing out on SO much.     People who know that Michael gave millions and millions of dollars to charities and he is innocent but yet still hate him, just coz they think he's ugly (since when did someone's face matter?) I think they are just stupid.    Please be aware that this is what I think and I'm sorry if I've made it out that all fans think like that even if they don't lol    And I do wish you were a MJ fan.    edit - thank you very much for the best answer as well dear, and I am very sorry I have blocked, but it's so you dont answer any of my questions with your nasty answers. If you stopped causing trouble on here for MJ I would unblock you. I want to unblock you but it would not be wise of me my dear.|`|AA11878029	because every day some one ask a MJ question.  Personally I don't hate anybody !!!|`|ZeKnInbjaa	I can't imagine.(:/|`|IHUS8wsbaa	BUT I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!! then i get to answer silly questions.     it can go both ways    WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE HATE ON MICHAEL JACKSON FANS??    fans hate haters haters hate fans    and it all depends on the person  som fans respect haters  like some  haters respect fans  from bad era fan|`|gVTK6NhBaa	I have a question for you....    Why do you waste your life hating on him? He hasn't done ANYTHING to you personally, so why do you hate him? You have never even taken the time to learn about him have you?

xqrwDmyUaa	I wouldn't buy it, rent it instead. It was disappointing, I thought it would be a lot more funny than it was. Stepbrothers and Ghost Town were actually a lot funnier than I had anticipated, I would buy one of those first.  EDIT: if you want to watch a smart and funny Robert Downey Jr. film try "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" it was not what I was expecting at all, really great and funny little film.|`|lAP3UC79aa	yeah its good, it's really funny.|`|f7aed29e039705f0fc131842b8d52d13aa	I throught it was pretty good, very funny!!!|`|5kcO165naa	I'm a HUGE Robert Downey Jr. fan and found the movie hilarious. I even bought it on DVD. You've got to have a certain sense of humor to not get to worked up about the 'politically incorrect' parts. Because they aren't actually politically incorrect, they're just mocking method actors.     I LOVED it.|`|jwtRYXH0aa	Is good but not lol   XD  I recomended visit Capitancinema --*-- com and enjoy full movies online,new releases added everydays..just enter site in English And Join!!|`|QP4goOPkaa	so.funny....!!  but its a love hate kind of film me thinks...  if you like ben stiller comedys then u should like this one but its a bit more stupid funny than his usual ones...!!|`|nlsvqLj5aa	I really didn't like it.

JQa86WoVaa	Hahaha probably. With VIP tickets you get actual nice, clean bathrooms and showers, closer parking, better seating at the shows HOWEVER this is not the point of bonnaroo!! The point is meeting new people, being a grungy, happy, partying, hippie for a couple days. You don't need to be that clean, everyone will stink. With the regular tickets you will be right by everyone, partying with your neighbors etc. It depends on what kind of person you are and what kind of experience you want to have.

Faz de tudo para que o animal passe raiva e acaba ficando estressado e da ataca qualquer pessoa pensando estar diante de seu dono, que talvez seja um animal pior que ele.   Os animais da natureza, em seu meio natural lutam pela sobrevivncia e os da mesma espcie s?o at solidrios uns com os outros. Acontece, tambm, at com animais de espcies diferentes. J apareceu em vrias reportagens de TVs,  um cachorrinho cuidando de pintinho, gato, vaca e outros casos de animais de espcies diferentes, que pelos costumes populares, n?o se d?o bem e entre eles h uma verdadeira amizade.   um absurdo, pessoas que prendem animais para dar maus tratos ao bicho.

Diz o vendedor:  - Tem um motor mais potente,  mais comprido e mais longo, portanto mais rpido na subida,  mais bonito e nao bebe muito.  O marido compreende imediatamente o que sua mulher quis dizer.  Duas semanas mais tarde,  ela quem recebe um telegrama do marido.  - Mandei os papis para o divrcio, assine rpido.

Essa foi muito boa.  kkkkkkk....    Missa do novo padre            O novo padre da Parquia estava t?o nervoso no seu primeiro serm?o, que quase n?o conseguiu falar.  Antes do seu Segundo serm?o, no domingo seguinte, perguntou ao Arcebispo, como poderia fazer para relaxar.  Este lhe sugeriu que na prxima vez, colocasse umas gotas de vodka na gua e que depois de uns goles estaria mais tranquilo.  No fomingo seguinte aplicou a sugest?o e sentiu-se t?o bem, que poderia falar alto at no meio de uma tempestade, de t?o feliz e descontrado que se encontrava.  Depois de regressar a Reitoria da Parquia encontrou uma nota do  Arcebispo dizendo-lhe:  - Prezado Padre, seguem algumas observa??es:  1) Na prxima vez, coloque gotas de vodka na gua e n?o gotas de gua na vodka;  2) N?o coloque lim?o e a?car na borda do clice;  3) O manto da imagem de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo n?o deve ser usado como guardanapo;  4) Existem 10 mandamentos e n?o 12;  5) Existem 12 Apstolos, e n?o 10;  6) Judas traiu Jesus, n?o o sacaneou;  7) Jesus foi crusficado, n?o enforcado;  8) Tiradentes n?o tem nada a ver com a histria;  9) A hstia n?o  chicletes, portanto evite tentar fazer bolas;  10) Aquela casinha  o confessionrio, n?o o banheiro;  11) Evite apoiar-se na imagem de Nossa Senhora, muito menos abra?-la;  12) A iniciativa de chamar o pblico para cantar foi louvvel, mas fazer trenzinho e corer pela igreja foi demais  13) gua benta  para se benzer e n?o para resfrescar a nuca;  14) Nunca reze a missa sentado na escada do altar, muito menos com o p sobre a Biblia Sagrada;  15) As hstias devem ser distribuidas para os fiis; jamais usadas como aperitivo para acompanhar o vinho;  16) Procure usar roupas debaixo da batina;  17) Evite abanar-se com a batina quando estiver com calor;  18) Jesus nasceu em Belm, mas isto n?o significa que ele seja paraense;  19) Numa missa n?o se deve fazer perguntas ao pblico;  20) Tambm n?o se deve pedir ajuda aos universitrios. At porque eles n?o sabem nada;  21) Quem peca  um picador; n?o um filho da pu.ta;  22) Quem peca vai para o Inferno; e n?o pra pu.ta que o pariu.    Pelos 45 minutos de missa que acompanhei, notei essas falhas. Espero que tais falhas sejam corrigidas j para o prximo domingo.  Atenciosamente, . Arcebispo.

No ato de plgio, o plagiador se apropria indevidamente da obra intelectual de outra pessoa, assumindo a autoria da mesma." Ou seja, plgio  usar trabalho de outro sem citar quem  o autor.    Uma outra coisa completamente diferente  fazer uma vers?o da obra (no caso, da msica), o que  tambm conhecido como "cover". Neste caso, o msico interpreta a msica de outro artista, mas diz (no disco, no show, etc.) quem  o autor, e paga os direitos autorais correspondentes.    No caso das msicas citadas:  - Train Kept A-Rollin',  de autoria de Tiny Bradshaw, Howard Kay, and Lois Mann e foi escrita em 1951. Portanto, n?o pode ser dos Yardbirds. O Led nunca gravou uma vers?o de estdio desta msica.  - Babe I'm Gonna Leave You  de autoria de Anne Bredon. A vers?o do Led  baseada em um cover da msica, feita por Joan Baez. No disco da Joan Baez, a autora n?o foi creditada, e a msica aparece como "Tradicional". Por isso, no disco original do Led os crditos diziam "Trad., arr. Page". Mas, a partir de 1990, a msica  creditada como "Anne Bredon/Jimmy Page & Robert Plant".  - I Can't Quit You Baby  do Willy Dixon, e recebeu os crditos por isso. Portanto, n?o  plgio.  - White Summer  baseada em uma msica tradicional irlandesa chamada She Moved Through the Fair. A vers?o tocada por Jimmy Page  copiada de um arranjo para esta msica feito por Davey Graham. Entretanto, n?o sei se houve processo por plgio, e qual teria sido o resultado.  - em Stairway to Heaven, a introdu??o  baseada na msica instrumental Taurus, da banda Spirit. Entretanto, quando perguntado sobre isso, o autor de Taurus, Randy California, disse que nunca considerou a introdu??o de Stairway como plgio, mas sim como um "retrabalho" da sua msica.    De todas as msicas citadas, portanto, a nica em que houve plgio comprovado foi Whole Lotta Love, cuja letra foi considerada cpia de You Need Love, de Willy Dixon. Houve uma a??o judicial, vencida pelo Willy Dixon.    Outro caso foi o de Bring It On Home. A primeira parte  regrava??o da msica hom?nima de Willy Dixon - na vers?o de Sonny Boy Williamson - e a segunda parte  original de Page e Plant. Porm, n?o foram dados os crditos ao Willy Dixon relativos  primeira parte. Esta quest?o foi resolvida por meio de um acordo extra-judicial entre as gravadoras.

Mas acredito que voc esteja se referindo  msica "God Save The Queen", dos Sex Pistols. Esta msica gerou muita controvrsia na poca, por diversos fatos. Primeiro, porque o nome  o mesmo do hino britanico. Depois, a msica inicia dizendo "God save the Queen, a fascist regime", comparando, assim a monarquia britanica a um regime fascista. Depois, o seu lan?amento coincidiu com o Jubileu da rainha, evento com grandes festividades na Inglaterra. No final, a letra diz "there is no future in England's dreaming", e o refr?o "no future" que  repetido no final tornou-se palavra de ordem do movimento punk.|`|PcTT34ykaa	sex pistols    valeu!!!

Ningum vai brigar se a faca cair e quem pegar n?o fizer 3 cruzes no ch?o se n?o houver um bom motivo para a discuss?o. Ningum briga s porque a faca caiu no ch?o.  N?o pense em simpatias de amarra??o para o amor. Se voc ama, fa?a com que te amem. Ningum ama por obriga??o.  Se voc quer que algum v embora da sua casa, explique o motivo ao invs de colocar a vassoura atrs da porta. Se todos acreditarem mais na vida como ela , e n?o em contos de fadas, todos poderemos viver melhor com o prximo.  N?o espere algum surgir na sua vida porque voc repassou o e-mail para 10 pessoas, 5 responderam e voc fez um pedido. Fa?a acontecer, n?o espere por um milagre.

I just hope  and pray now that Jade will be able to get a treatment that can cure it, i really hope and pray for a miracle for her, as she has been through so much in her life. Lets just hope and pray she wins this battle for the sake of her boys. God bless you JadeXXX|`|lnUrm4sGaa	of course she looks frightened wouldnt you the poor girl, shes young and has two young sons  she dosnt want to die   the  cancer the chemo is taking its toll on her thats why shes looks so ill|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Poor girl. I think she gets a lot of undeserved stick. I wouldn't wish that on anyone and I think 99.9% of people would be petrified. I hope she gets better, so we can all be amazed at the stuff she says again.|`|bljBwqCaaa	jesus christ      i feel sorry for her, you might not like her as a person but nobody deserves that.|`|p0c4mek6aa	I got to be honest, this woman used to really get on my wick.

My heart goes out to her and to her two young sons . Of course she is going to be frightened and would be in her position . I would hate to know that I would not see my children grow up and be missing from their lives.    I had cancer 10 years ago and I had 3 children aged 3, 19 months and 3 months when I was diagnosed and I was devastaed at that thought of not being able to see them grow up . I was lucky and beat it .|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	Wouldn't you?|`|H93JbQS0aa	I feel bad for her too! its not nice aspecially fact that its spread, she needs to take care of herself more! hope she gets out of it.|`|jrVlzffeaa	I couldn't bare to watch to show, my mum went through chemo and radiotherapy a couple of years ago and it has come back in another place, so she's got to go and have tests done to see if it s spread further too.

Lets hope they can prolong her life and come on everyone have a good clear out this weekend and take all your unwanted treasures to the nearest cancer research or hospice shop.   Again for Bad Buffy no one on here are hypocrites - people like you are just sh*t scared and glad its not you as you probably wouldn't cope.

c6HfikOHaa	yeah when your young you want to be older when your older you want to be younger and by the time you've worked out what you do want your dead. Cruel life ain't it|`|r6oi1HyZaa	no, the best part of life is the younger ages, i.e somewhere before the early 20s, you can still be mature and have fun, but once you are out in the real world and act proper (or proper in general), then that is when people grow up.. some people never grow up (physically, they do, lol), but usually these people are not very successful; not always, but in a lot of cases.    when lord was yelled at for growing up, he did some mistakable things.  but to become mature, it means to look deep inside yourself and make a small change.. e.g you can be generous, etc., but you can still enjoy the simple things in life, but you have to have some self control.  :)    hope you feel better|`|4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	so you can bury your parents|`|gn1Y5N1Raa	people have been telling me to grow up for years, i'm 27 now and still have not grown up haha, ignore those people, enjoy your life|`|ltDPK4UFaa	I agree with you.

As as adult you do regret making yourself grow up quickly but its from all those mistakes you make that you can teach the future generation, or else where would we get advice from the oldies.|`|jWl7Zi1Uaa	It sucks but don't let it bother you.

A couple nights a month we like to go to the Casino.

But I feel a bit better than I did back then.|`|AF2d1fXBaa	You could maybe try sex with your boyfriend......oh wait, that would be ridiculous.|`|qGBklnngaa	punch something unbreakable or bite on something hard, obviously nothing that would get broken, damsaged or damage yourself.

r8s5j6zOaa	they love seeing you at your best|`|94NYYq5Haa	so that you won't ask for anything|`|wwzoqIvVaa	It's a talent.|`|UmAM1cW8aa	Because they have nothing to do LOL|`|elECfJ52aa	Because that way you can not answer   I think there is an underlying plot like if you say I did not like the food  they can say well you were eating it and could not talk|`|tTf1Zp5eaa	I know, I dont know why they bother asking that because my boyfriend said no once and the waitress just smirked and walked off! the ruddy cheek.|`|AI4My948aa	Well, really.  How much fun do they get to have at work?|`|xm0kLvnLaa	Ugh...I know. Why do they? Thought it was just me. Maybe they wait for that moment for entertainment value.|`|7sXNwFynaa	they are letting you know indirectly that you owe them money after.|`|sixm6Vlraa	or they ask right when the plate has been brought to you. Hate that, why don;t you give me a minute to try it...|`|TZiySTOGaa	so you dont have chance to complain about it if u do have something to say lol... i usually go and take my food to the desk if there is a problem and i ask them if they would eat what they had given me....|`|PSk0zY5uaa	just give them a thumbs up|`|1uIbCMmiaa	`Cos they dont like you doing that sort of thing to their waitresses|`|Dl1J1Y9Haa	so u won't be able to tell them off|`|c2e6c1a67df3c28e5c0aa3c4021db92aaa	OH MY GOD i hate that so much lol!|`|TrN99meFaa	So you just have to nod your head in a "yes" kind of way......    You're hardly able to complain with a mouthful of food. See how they disappear immediately after the "yes" nod?|`|REdcuFwOaa	B/c dumb **** like that amuses them, they are feeble minded.|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	That annoys me also, so now i just answer them , the food falling out of my mouth whilst doing this normally stops them asking again.|`|F6U9eM6Gaa	Because they want to get you right when you have a mouthful so you can take all the time to chew and then tell them about the yummy etc etc etc etc etc|`|yguqhf7Xaa	Because you eat like a pig and they scared that you might vomit all out.|`|WfwlGbUAaa	Maybe because they know you can't complain when your mouth is full.|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	For the same reason they all hide in the back when things aren't ok!|`|2LgDssZEaa	maybe because they messed with our food and are just checking if we are eating it...|`|jQ0KXt6Aaa	I don't know!    But it seems to ALWAYS happen.    Awkwarrdddd.|`|NH5htkAyaa	I know they should ask during the meal , not when i am under the table :)|`|zz4JkjbMaa	I was a waitress many years ago and was guilty of doing this.  The reason why was because I used to get so p!ssed off asking the same thing over and over again I would do anything to amuse myself.  During a particularly busy service I just stood in the middle of the room and shouted to all diners 'is everything ok?'.  It's not as though they really want to know the answer, it's just part of the job|`|PeqdWE3waa	Unfortunately I very rarely go out to a restaurant.  Usually pick up takeaway meal or cook at home.|`|3qa3BftUaa	Lol. That is just the most annoying thing. Why do they have to ask. If it was'nt ok I'd tell them. Any waiters reading this. LEAVE me alone|`|31ZDLfBcaa	lol! That happened to me the other week! They got to see a mouthful of nachos whilst saying "yes thank you" :)|`|hviykDAraa	ha ha this always happens and i hate it!!!    Why cant they leave you alone, if anything was wrong you would let them know!!! It really gets on my nerves, when theyve walked away i always say 'it was until you aksed that'!!!!

bYlEqiKVaa	Nope, none of them have blogs.  Don't be fooled by anything you find on MySpace, Facebook, whatever.  It has been claimed numerous times by show producers and cast members themselves that they don't maintain blogs or have profiles on any of these networking websites.  Sorry to burst the bubbles of some kids out there, but the people running those pages claiming to be cast are entirely fake and, frankly, very high on the creepy scale.    The One Tree Hill Writers, however, do have an official blog on myspace: http://www.myspace.com/othwriters.  That one is legit.    They also have a One Tree Hill podcast (a very popular one), that is free on iTunes, so you could check that out.  It's usually creator Mark Schwahn talking.      CWTV has a decent series of interviews with all the cast members.      And finally, and perhaps most effectively, you could just go to youtube and search for whomever you want, with the word "interview" next to their name, and you'll have more results than you can handle.    Hope this helps.|`|USkBR4ntaa	there myspace has blogs and youtube has the interviews or there fan site.

Leda2ha0aa	Project Runway is one of my favorite shows.  I thought I read that they were taking it to LA this season and so the regular judges would not be on due to it moving to the other coast.      I was just watching the Season 1 winner on Bonnie Hunt and he did not take the money when he became winner.  He said he couldn't talk about it, but he wanted everything to come from him and the whole line to be his from top to bottom.  Sometimes winning these competitions is a blessing and a curse - when you win, you get the money but you also have to give up many rights to what you've created.    I can't wait for the next season to start though.  (Never saw the Canada version either).    Add'l note:  That add'l clause is just like what happens with American Idol winners.  They never fully are able to do what they want to on a record - they're strapped by the American idol "people".  That's why I think it's better to come in second place on some of these shows.  I'm sure many just want to go on for some exposure and don't just look to win.|`|RQD7Z0eXaa	No. but here in the U.S.A. i don't think there are any more seasons so i miss it A LOT!!! i loved that show |`|hEAuWYYjaa	i love project runway and i wish it would be on already, i have watched all of the other seasons and i just cant wait|`|uUHMg5Szaa	I have, I love that show, I love designing clothes so a lot of times I will do the same challenges that they do lol    (=|`|b7d3fe1e0770cd80916e81d846475327aa	I used to love this show but last season was so weak, I lost interest.

Se4tvrYJaa	Eu j ouvi algumas mas faz tempo, n?o sei se ainda existem sites com essas subliminares. Elas s?o propositais e geralmente s?o feitas usando uma tcnica chamada backward masking, em que se grava alguma coisa ao contrrio que, quando ouvida normalmente, n?o se  entende nada do que  dito ou se entende outra coisa mas, quando ouvida ao contrrio, pode-se entender a real mensagem daquele barulho ou frase. Assim, ela n?o  captada conscientemente mas fica gravada no subconsciente. J foi muito usada por bandas de heavy metal, como Iron Maiden, por exemplo.     (para subliminares em msicas, visite este site: http://www.showdalua.com/musicassub.html...  e isso!|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Uma noite e meia com Claudinho e Buchecha de trs para frente  sinistro.|`|dud2yEFBaa	Como eu n?o costumo escutar as musicas de trs pra frente, mesmo que seja verdade as mensagens subliminares n?o me afetariam.    ;-)|`|uzsG0QGpaa	Acredito...  existe propositalmente em msicas dos Engenheiros do Havaii, por exemplo...  Estas mensagens subliminares s?o utilizadas com fins perversos, de encentivo a violncia, drogas e tantos outros, pois  comprovada a sua eficcia, o subcosnciente compreende as mensagens, mesmo que vc as n?o denote...  O Backward Masking, foi primeiramente utilizado pelos Beatles, que se valiam de fitas cassetes autoverses, que foram patenteadas e n?o comercializadas para fazerem tais grava??es em Msicas como "Piggies" (porcos)...  Em muitos outros casos foi utilizado esta ferramenta, que a lei trata da seguinte maneira:SUBLIMINAR E AS LEIS O que diz a Lei: A Propaganda Subliminar nem mesmo  citada nas leis, NADA PROBE NO BRASIL, mas por um processo de hermenutica-interpreta??o foi proposto que se aplique aos casos dela o artigo 20 do Cdigo de tica dos Publicitrios, que diz que as mensagens devem ser ostensivas e assumidas ( o merchandising subliminar  anti-tico, pois  ostensivo e dissimulado), assim como tambm o artigo 36 do Cdigo de Defesa do Consumidor, que probe anncios disfar?ados, dissimulados. O QUE  SUBLIMINAR? Voc sabe o que  Mensagem Subliminar? Talvez n?o, mas com certeza j foi vtima dela. A Mensagem Subliminar  dotada de uma arte a mais. A arte da persuas?o inconsciente. Ela trabalha com o subconsciente das pessoas. D-se o nome de mensagem ou propaganda subliminar toda aquela mensagem que  transmitida em um baixo nvel de percep??o, tanto auditiva quanto visual. Embora n?o possamos identificar esta absor??o da informa??o, o nosso subconsciente capta-a e ela  assimilada sem nenhuma barreira consciente, e aceitamo-la como se tivssemos sido hipnotizados. Por defini??o, subliminares s?o as mensagens que nos s?o enviadas dissimuladamente, ocultas, abaixo dos limites da nossa percep??o consciente. E que v?o influenciar nossas escolhas, atitudes, motivar a tomada de decis?es posteriores. Subliminares s?o mensagens que entram na nossa mente de contrabando, como um vrus de computador que fica inerte, latente, e s  ativado na hora certa.|`|tfpJSb1Kaa	eu acredito em algumas musicas..  mas tem outras q o povo viaja demais..  tem gente q deve passar o dia todo tentando axar mensagens subliminar em musica, filmes e propaganda..

Sabemos que os transtornos depressivos s?o altamente incapacitantes e geralmente recorrentes. Os transtornos afetivos recorrentes e a epilepsia tm sido utilizados como exemplos clssicos de modelo de sensibiliza??o comportamental do tipo kindling. A associa??o entre convuls?es e transtornos afetivos ocorre em aproximadamente um ter?o dos pacientes, especialmente naqueles com foco no lobo temporal. De acordo com este modelo de transtorno afetivo, os primeiros episdios s?o mais associados com estressores psicossociais maiores do que com os episdios que ocorrem tardiamente na doen?a. No modelo kindling h associa??o de dois princpios da pesquisa neurofisiolgica: vulnerabilidade progressiva e sensibiliza??o comportamental. Nosso relato mostrar a evolu??o de uma paciente com doen?a afetiva cr?nica e foco irritativo no lobo temporal esquerdo durante 5 anos, alm das dificuldades em se estabelecer seu diagnstico e teraputica. Uma das causas da gravidade e refratariedade dessa paciente talvez seja justamente a procura tardia por ajuda com uma histria de transtorno afetivo de longa dura??o. Estes conceitos e o caso ilustram a importancia de uma interven??o precoce e continuada em transtornos afetivos recorrentes, evitando a morbidade, a vulnerabilidade e recorrncia, a cronicidade e a resistncia ao tratamento.    Unitermos: Depress?o dupla; Foco temporal; Sensibiliza??o comportamental; Transtorno afetivo recorrente.

I'm not really a fan of the song itself.|`|vN6J6nELaa	I prefer Leona Lewis', but I am a fan of Avril.|`|MMhbxSHcaa	In my opinion Leona Lewis' version is better but it depends on the sort of melody you like, as to who sung it, sorry but i don't know.|`|uXsqZLoiaa	a lot of artists sing the same song.  they only sing them to get money!

14f68b3ce9b74fe1effcb259219a38a9aa	Plastic on the couch, what a great sound that makes while having sex.|`|cuIX13BKaa	I am not much for plastic....but my immediate reaction was regarding 1) Microwaving Food and 2) Wrapping myself in it and how atrocious I would look greeting people at the door in it not to mention how absurd I would look and feel...squeaky and side splitting humour overcame me!  ME in Saran Wrap? Oh god just get it over with and take a damn shower curtain and roll me up like a joint! I am soooo laughing! Well you wanted an explanation and i giveth to your whim...but only this time! (kidding) Great Question!    Garbo|`|DmKH9ZaRaa	Leave the plastic on ... especially if he`s a bed-wetter  ... LOL   x|`|K8QRRp2Oaa	uhmmmm.........what? explain plz|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	leave it on.  you gotta protect it.        whoa.. that came out wrong.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Reminds me of an elderly neighbour I used to have who bought a new lounge and couldn't decide whether to leave the plastic on or off.|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	but tell me, why would you be wearing a plastic chastity belt.|`|aJFVCGOgaa	what kind of plastic- thats what i thought   x|`|Hw3n0nenaa	If you leave tha plastic on it melts into the food and tastes nasty.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Take the plastic off dude ;)  I'd never want to eat a muffin with the plastic on!|`|M1OceGNLaa	Take it off. How else could I eat the cheese?    The farthest my mind has taken me would have to be...um...Nova Scotia.
hTr1dpTiaa	I liked it!! It kinda gave me a different appreciation for him because before I just saw him as another dumb *** rapper... but now I think he's hot haha!|`|RsYwCOeFaa	hahaha|`|TLNQZ63baa	Granny Gums wants to gum Lil Dwayne, word!|`|VsamHLPOaa	I saw it. I liked it for the most part. Don't like the whole "I'm a gangsta" thing though. Why not just call yourself a grown man.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	His Music Prom queen is Horrible|`|pR860mw7aa	idc cause soulja boy is the best rapper alive    lil wayne aint got nothin on him|`|YHIFlsvoaa	I was going to watch it but I was busy  plus Katie Couric gives me headaches|`|bYWTE40Vaa	I think he drank too much cough syrup before the show    Is your grandma blind by any chance?|`|Xnmkdim0aa	I felt the same way, lol|`|oP8blO9Paa	didn't see it but bcuz its Wayne.....  FAIL.|`|6YZ74lEOaa	Wow I had no idea of what kind of person he was behind the music and all but I like him and his personality! Wow I had no idea he had two kids!|`|M1OceGNLaa	That's probably how he acts in real life. "Lil' Wayne the rapper" is probably just a mask he puts on when he performs. In interviews and stuff he's most likely just like you and me.|`|7dPm35LYaa	I don't think Lil Wayne should even be nominated for 8 Grammy's.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	nevermind about that piece of trash - why would a supposed jounalist even give him the time of day to talk about what an incredible poor influence he is AND she giggles through the interview. gag me.|`|JUvmf3dyaa	Watch the full interview as well as all of Lil Wayne's latest videos, news, music downloads, and pictures @ http://www.thalilwayne.com/blog/|`|XB5UCW0Raa	I didnt see it.|`|8nm2psyKaa	Didn't see it but Weezy is always the $h!t so I'm sure it was ok|`|AA10838250	stinks|`|lkPYYLiKaa	i didnt see it but he was probably blazed|`|3EyK4x2Naa	I didn't see it. I love Lil Wayne though. I hope he's okay =)|`|16rD9k32aa	Nope. I'm not a fan of rap, and I think that Katie Couric should have stayed on the morning show. I don't have anything against women news anchors, just her. She tries too hard to be the cutsie-pie.|`|nsXiB4gsaa	I don't know?    Can you put a link up of it?|`|c8HHi3Wqaa	Are you seriously using Lil Wayne and think in the same sentence?|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	I'm afraid I missed that incredible meeting of the minds.|`|531f6a6374dfe1e1a0a3027ce2dd7ae5aa	I didn't watch it.

We get them every year trick or treating.|`|rOj4B5QNaa	Those were great!  Do they make them anymore?  I loved the candy cigarettes too!|`|K3FV1xZNaa	haha yeah. o.o i used to hate those. but i was trying to be "buff"|`|oa3kVDFyaa	yes, omg!!! They were good!! I liked them all!!|`|KPZUJCQgaa	I like the Blue one. They sell some at the store I go to. So if I'm craving some, I can get 45 cents, and buy some.|`|RtJ11zUZaa	Awesome!

I loved the blue ones|`|M1OceGNLaa	Lemon all the waaaay!!!!!    I remember those things, back when they had real candy instead of just sugar-coated sugar.|`|vtmvud6eaa	I used to love them, now I can't eat them without making that face.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	oooh! my friend, sister, and I would always have a competiton! we would blow all our money off to buy them from the ice-cream man in the summer! there was also this "sour meter" that said how many seconds you could hold it in your mouth!lol  I loved blue raspberry, and black cherry was good too!    I havent had one in like 5 years.......|`|Xnmkdim0aa	nope i don't|`|24d9HoJTaa	Oh I love them, the liked the blue and black cherry. They're still around.|`|x1Rreqhvaa	I do remember them.

My favorite flavor was lemon. Yummy!|`|xxSGhywoaa	Is black cherry the ones in the dark red wrapper?  I always like those things, then they started putting ulcers in my cheeks and tongue.|`|XB5UCW0Raa	OMG i loved those things.|`|AA11656632	Yes|`|yLoksHiFaa	yes, i loved the blue ones.|`|87yovKYlaa	I'm currently eating a blue one (blue raspberry)    you can get them at dollar tree.

2z1h5mfOaa	I think it meams that whatever happens in life you only see it in extremes of good or bad, acceptable or not etc.  Life is also about grey areas, things that are neither all good or bad, all acceptable or not.  Other people will talk about seeing things through rose tinted glasses, i.e. seeing everything as wonderful.|`|HC5BJ4AQaa	it means things are either one thing or another, nothing is complicated or in between.|`|yuv6YUo3aa	tough and easy time in your life...both teach you  about life  it tells us about difficulties and love,joy|`|XB5UCW0Raa	You always look at things one way or another.

For real expensive coffee, it has to be black for me, in order to enjoy and evaluate the bean. Adding things to expensive coffee ruins it. That's why you buy the $$$ coffee, to taste and decide on the bean.    Anyway, enjoy it how you like it. If you don't like black at all, try some expensive coffee when you can and you may really like it. It tastes different than Folgers or Maxwell House.

Para os cantores, "o estandarte do sanatrio geral vai passar"  um bom teste de afina??o; e o "Vai passar!", dito no final do refr?o com tanta suavidade, parece, ao mesmo tempo, um consolo a quem sofre e um aviso a quem maltrata.

Portanto, nunca vi nada d certo pra um monte de gente q esteja relacionado a horscopo.

Seu simbolismo gravita em torno do prazer e das posses, como Touro, mas desta vez voltado para a rela??o com o outro. Da vem o conceito clssico de que Escorpi?o corresponde ao sexo e s paix?es possessivas que acompanham a vida amorosa.  No hemisfrio norte, a entrada do Sol neste signo acontece no meio do outono. As rvores perdem duas folhas amareladas e preparam-se para a chegada do inverno. A vida parece concentrar-se em estado latente,  espera do momento mais adequado para o ressurgimento, quanto tiverem findado as agruras do ambiente. O escorpiano  assim: recolhe-se em seu interior e s se mostra quando vai agir, especialmente se a ordem  atacar.     Intensidade e paix?o s?o importantes tra?os. Podem entregar-se a um propsito, ou pessoa, de corpo e alma, e n?o deixar?o que as dificuldades os esmore?am. Porm, s?o bastante melindrosos e ofendem-se por quest?es irrisrias. Rancorosos e vingativos, ir?o perseguir a revanche com a mesma persistncia. J que mantm parte de suas emo??es reprimidas, os amigos jamais sabem at onde sua obstina??o  movida por amor ou pelo dio, ambos em nveis extrapolados.    Os escorpianos gostam de trabalhar em equipe e em tarefas comunitrias. S?o timos administradores de negcios de outras pessoas, mas n?o t?o bons em seus prprios negcios. S?o possessivos, como os taurinos, mas com rela??o a pessoas. Podem at sentir-se dono delas, pois tendem a ser mand?es e querer que tudo saia como eles desejam. Suas rela??es ntimas costumam ser magnticas, bem como carregadas de drama. S?o bastante atraentes e erticos. O sexo  parte essencial de suas vidas. Vem o orgasmo como um portal dimensional, atravs do qual podem comungar do momento da cria??o.    Altos e baixos s?o uma constante em as vida. Dado que s?o sigilosos com rela??o ao que sentem, guardar?o suas emo??es dentro de si, at que transbordem ou entrem em erup??o. A depress?o inevitavelmente os levar para o pior dos infernos, mas  justamente a que se encontra a chave para sua recupera??o. Pois os escorpianos conhecem bem as profundezas da alma e possuem uma capacidade de regenera??o espantosa. Retrair-se ao abismo  sua forma de expurgar as dores e as frustra??es, para que consigam retornar purificados ao mundo, como uma fnix que renasce das prprias cinzas.    A intui??o  um de seus pontos fortes, bem como a pesquisa. Acostumados  mistrios e segredos, sua mente possui a perspiccia e a intensidade necessrias para aprofundar-se em alguma quest?o. S?o pessoas com um grande apelo pelo oculto e pela cincia.     Na mitologia, os escorpi?o  um animal associado com a morte. A morte se representa na atitude do escorpiano de duas formas. A primeira  sua habilidade de morrer simbolicamente e renascer renovado. A segunda  sua habilidade de "matar", pois ele tem em si a habilidade de focar seu dio e sua perversidade em botes certeiros e pe?onhentos. O veneno do escorpiano pode estar em sua crtica, nas palavras de desprezo ou nas intrigas que cria por vingan?a; pode estar mesmo apenas em seu olhar.    no amor:    Escorpi?o  o signo da paix?o e do sexo, e esses sentimentos se manifestam livremente nas pessoas nascidas sob esse signo. Atraentes e sedutores, eles encontram no sexo um caminho para viver experincias novas e msticas.   Escorpianos procuram um parceiro/a que os compreenda e tenham coragem de viver um relacionamento intenso. Quando isso acontece, eles s?o muito devotados e se entregam completamente ao romance. Essa dedica??o pode provocar muitas cenas de cimes e, se voc estiver envolvida com um escorpiano, cuidado para n?o provocar essas cenas que podem minar sua rela??o.  Essa liga??o com o sexo e a paix?o pode ser benfica ou destrutiva. Se mal administrada, o desejo e a necessidade por afei??o podem aprisionar o escorpiano em uma eterna busca pela satisfa??o e realiza??o de seus desejos.     na carreira:    A frieza do Escorpi?o faz dele um timo analista e um profissional para aqueles momentos crticos. A concentra??o e a determina??o dos escorpianos fazem dele um refgio para quando o cu est caindo na cabe?a de todos.     N?o h obstculos que n?o possam ser superados por esses desbravadores. A inteligncia e sabedoria o colocam em posi??o de conselheiro. Escorpi?o  um signo de atos grandiosos.     Os nativos de escorpi?o s?o bons engenheiros, investigadores e mdicos.|`|ls2C3QOeaa	Simpaticas  Educadas  Orgulhosas  Fala o que pensa  Vaidosas  Se preocupa com quem ama    essas s?o algumas que consegui perceber pois namoro ou namorava com uma escorpiana, e fiz uma pergunta sobre essas rela??oe entre gemeos e escorpi?o....quem quiser responder desde de j obrigado!!!|`|HGXKrsixaa	ESCORPI?O  Tenha gelo  m?o, voc pode precisar.

Eu procuro pensar de forma positiva, crendo que tudo me  possvel, DESDE QUE, isso seja plano de Deus na minha vida, pois Ele sabe o que  melhor para mim. Ele n?o v apenas o hoje e sim o futuro e por isso eu entrego a Ele a minha vida e tudo que me venha a ocorrer.

Achei muito "auto ajuda", alm de apresentar uma vis?o de mundo muito superficial. Alm disso o filme chove no molhado porque tem aprox 1h 30 min de dura??o sendo que poderia ter 20, sem que faltasse falar sobre nada, isso o tornou muito cansativo. Achei um pouco materialista, meio que uma idia de que o "ter"  melhor que o "ser", vis?o da qual eu descordo.   Bom  apenas uma quest?o de gosto e eu n?o gostei nada.    Abra?os a todos!!!

AA11088699	I will assume you are asking about Star Wars IV:  A New Hope    Physical challenges:  The basic challenge of fighting against all his adversaries.  You have to watch the movie and notate every time there is a physical conflict, and there are many -- fighting to get Princess Leah out of under Vader's clutches is the most obvious.    Mental challenges:  This is the core of the story/movie.  What does Luke need to do to become a man from a boy...How does he not give in to the dark side as was the fate of his father (who Luke doesn't know about...yet!)...And finally, can he overcome all doubts about himself to be a Jedi knight?       The first major mental challenge Luke faces is how to serve the Rebellion when he has obligation to his uncle and the family farm?  His uncle needs him there to help with the harvest...yet all Luke wants to do is be a fighter pilot in the Rebellion against the Empire, whom he hates...    Which sets him up for the the next mental challenge:  Can he free Princess Leah from Vedar's prison?      And finally...does he have the fortitude to blow up the Death Star?      When you watch the movie (yet again!), look for these conflicts, and how he overcomes his doubts, and you will answer your own questions.  In my opinion, the mental challenges are greater than the physical ones, which are obvious.    Good luck...this seems to be a great project!|`|AA12059806	have you watched the movie? watch it again.|`|BKrqlGz4aa	Block me if you want to but how the hell you think you can write about something you don't understand is beyond me.

He has an inner struggle between staying home to help out his Aunt and Uncle on the moisture farm, or go and chase his dreams. It's decided for him, when the only family he thinks he has left is brutally murdered by the Empire. It's a tragic loss for him, but at the same time it motivates him to become a Jedi and fight the evil he knows exists. Since his experience is limited, he's often ridiculed for his naive behavior. He's exposed to what the galaxy has to offer and begins to understand how large, powerful, and evil the Empire really is. To sum it all up, I would say his main challenge in this film is mentally digesting everything he witnesses and learns about his past and the present around him.|`|a3676aca87080491421efac8d368cbfaaa	Well just imagine, he is the last jedi left and he barely found out.

A chamada maldi??o de Poltergeist, o filme, permite que especula??es do tipo os espritos amaldi?oando os vivos, sejam feitas. A causa disso tudo foram as mortes ocorridas desde que o primeiro filme da srie foi lan?ado em 1982. O diretor deste, Steven Spielberg, nem toca no assunto, mas isso n?o impede que sua fama tenebrosa continue e s n?o v mais adiante porque at a protagonista deles, a pequena Heather O'Rourke, morreu em fevereiro de 88, aps uma opera??o intestinal. A primeira morte trgica foi a da atriz Dominique Duane, a irm? mais velha de Heather no filme, logo aps a estria de Poltergeist I, quando um ex-namorado ciumento simplesmente a espancou e depois estrangulou. Em 84 a mesma equipe gravou o nmero II, subintitulado O Outro Lado, em que um fato estranho aconteceu: a casa escolhida como cenrio havia sido realmente construda em cima de um cemitrio Chumash(uma tribo de ndios que vivia ali no sculo 17), coincidentemente a histria do primeiro filme. N?o deu outra: em 1985, o ator Julian Beck, que interpretava o reverendo que azucrinava a famlia Freeling ao nmero II, morreu de um cancer fulminante. Todas essas coincidncias n?o impediram, entretanto, que fosse feito o filme III, subintitulado A Maldi??o(n?o existe nome melhor, n?o?). Outra tragdia: em junho de 86 morreu Will Sampson, aos 53 anos, depois de um transplante de cora??o. Sampson havia feito o ndio que ajudava a famlia no filme II e havia instrudo os produtores sobre a magia indgena e maldi??o queles que perturbam os espritos.

EXlMWGLiaa	"O futuro pertence  jovem guarda porque a velha est ultrapassada." Descontextualizada pelo publicitrio Carlito Maia, a frase do lder sovitico Vladimir Lnin batizou no Brasil, em 1965 um dos programas de TV de maior audincia da poca: o Jovem Guarda, apresentado pelos emergentes cantores e dolos juvenis Roberto Carlos (O Rei), Erasmo Carlos (O Tremend?o) e Wanderla (A Ternurinha). No auge da sua popularidade, ele chegou a alcan?ar trs milh?es de espectadores s em S?o Paulo, de onde era transmitido (em videotape, ele chegava tambm ao Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre e Recife). Mais do que uma boa idia para preencher o horrio que ficou vago por causa da proibi??o da transmiss?o direta dos jogos do campeonato paulista de futebol, mais do que uma excelente forma de derrotar o Festival da Juventude (lder de audincia da TV Excelsior desde 1964) e de vender um monte de quinquilharias (de discos a cal?as, blusas e at bonecas), o programa Jovem Guarda foi o catalizador de um movimento que p?s a msica brasileira em sintonia com o fen?meno internacional do rock (a esta altura, no seu segundo momento, o da invas?o britanica liderada pelos Beatles) e deu origem a toda uma nova linguagem, musical e novos padr?es de comportamento.     Entravam em cena as guitarras eltricas (incorporadas de vez  msica brasileira mais tpica pelo movimento seguinte, a Tropiclia), a idia de uma msica exclusivamente jovem, com signos jovens (mais at do que na bossa nova) e toda uma constela??o de artistas: Wanderley Cardoso, Jerry Adriani, Eduardo Arajo, Martinha, Ed Wilson, Waldirene (A Garota do Roberto), Leno & Llian, Deny e Dino, Bobby Di Carlo e grupos como Golden Boys, Renato & Seus Blue Caps, Os Incrveis, Os Vips e tantos outros. O programa de TV acabou em 1969, mas a esttica da Jovem Guarda nunca deixou de estar presente na msica brasileira feita a partir da dcada de 70.     Primeiros dolos   Os primrdios do movimento devem ser procurados na segunda metade dos anos 50, quando o pas come?ou a ser exposto  informa??o rocknroll, atravs dos discos de Elvis Presley e Bill Haley, da Revista do Rock e de programas como Hoje  Dia de Rock (de Jair de Taumaturgo, na Rdio Mayrink Veiga carioca), Clube do Rock (de Carlos Imperial, na TV-Rio) e Crush em Hi-Fi (na TV Record, de S?o Paulo). No fim da dcada, o pas ganhous seus primeiros dolos do rock: a paulista Cely Campello (de Estpido Cupido, vers?o de Stupid Cupid, de Neil Sedaka), Carlos Gonzaga (de Diana, vers?o para msica de Paul Anka), Srgio Murilo (de Marcianita e Broto Legal), Tony Campello (irm?o de Cely), Demtrius, Albert e Meire Pav?o. Eles representaram o rock em sua vertente mais adocicada, a das baladas. O contraponto selvagem, da eletricidade, de Elvis e Chuck Berry, ainda estava sendo gestado.     Na Tijuca, bairro do subrbio carioca, essa era a curti??o de uma turma de rapazes que se reunia na Rua do Matoso. Em 1958, China, Arlnio, Trindade, Tim Maia, Erasmo Carlos e Roberto Carlos formaram o grupo Os Sputniks, que acabou no mesmo ano, mas n?o sem antes chamar a aten??o de um sambista de idias eltricas que andava pela rea: Jorge Dulio Lima Meneses, o Jorge Ben. Em 1960, o rock da Juventude Transviada brasileira teria seu primeiro sucesso: Rua Augusta, de Ronnie Cord (Ronald Cordovil). Mas era tarde: o gnero come?ava a perder seu impacto, acossado pela bossa nova. No come?o da dcada, Cely Campello deixou a msica para se casar e Roberto Carlos foi cantar bossa.     O rock, porm, resistia nos subrbios de Rio e S?o Paulo, onde surgiram grupos vocais como Golden Boys (de Algum na Multid?o) e Trio Esperan?a (de A Festa do Bolinha, formado por irm?s dos Golden Boys) e instrumentais, na onda do Twist (inspirada pelo sucesso Lets Twist Again, de Chubby Checker), como Renato & Seus Blue Caps (no qual Erasmo Carlos chegou a cantar), The Jordans, The Jet Blacks e The Clevers (futuro Os Incrveis). No entanto, Srgio Murilo, Ronnie Cord e Demtrius seguiram dcada adentro fazendo rock-balada, ao lado de recm-chegados como George Freedman (Coisinha Estpida) e Wanderla.     Incio do reinado   Mas, em 1963, um renovado Roberto Carlos apereceu com Splish Splash (vers?o de Erasmo para msica de Bobby Darin), rock que daria ttulo ao seu LP daquele ano. Parei na Contram?o, o sucesso seguinte, abriu o caminho para o seu grande estouro: O Calhambeque. Com isso, Roberto n?o s renovou sua inscri??o no clube do rock, como iniciou seu reinado naquele cenrio que mais tarde seria conhecido como Jovem Guarda. Calhambeque seria o destaque de seu LP seguinte,  Proibido Fumar, cuja faixa-ttulo tornou-se outro clssico. O grande parceiro de Roberto, Erasmo Carlos, tambm come?ava nessa poca sua carreira solo, com o sucesso Minha Fama de Mau.     Em 22 de agosto de 1965, quando o programa Jovem Guarda estreou, o cenrio do movimento estava quase que completamente montado  Wanderley Cardoso era O Bom Rapaz, Eduardo Arajo O Bom, Jerry Adriani O Italianssimo, Martinha O Queijinho de Minas, Rosemary A Boneca Loura Que Canta, Ronnie Von O Pequeno Prncipe. Outros que tambm chegaram: Srgio Reis, Antonio Marcos, Vanusa, Agnaldo Rayol, The Fevers, Ed Wilson (irm?o de Renato e Paulo Csar Barros, do Renato & Seus Blue Caps), Prini Lorez, The Pops... Naquelas "jovens tardes de domingo", a palavra de ordem era i-i-i, adpata??o do "yeah, yeah, yeah!", da msica She Loves You, dos Beatles  n?o por acaso, o filme do quarteto, A Hards Day Night, foi exibido no Brasil com o ttulo de Os Reis do I-I-I. A maior parte das letras eram ingnuas e recatadas, e boa parte das msicas, vers?es de sucessos do rock americano, britanico, italiano e at japons  Erasmo Carlos, Renato Barros e Rossini Pinto eram os grandes versionistas.

Senta que a histria  longa!!!!    Num sentido estrito, a express?o Jovem Guarda designou programa da TV Record, de S?o Paulo SP, estreado em setembro de 1965 e findo em 1969, comandado por Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos e Wanderlia; mas tem sido comumente empregada para definir gnero musical tambm conhecido como i-i-i, seja, a vers?o brasileira do rock internacional. A Jovem Guarda foi, entretanto, cristaliza??o de uma tendncia bem anterior: a informa??o do rocknroll norte-americano da dcada de 1950 j criara no Brasil um mercado de consumidores e aficionados, permitindo que, desde 1957, os primeiros cantores e compositores brasileiros do gnero tentassem reproduzir o ritmo com letras em portugus ou cantando no original. Entre os maiores expoentes desse perodo estavam os irm?os Tony e Celly Campelo, Srgio Murilo, Ed Wilson e, em fase pouco posterior, Ronnie Cord e os grupos The Jordans, The Jet Blacks e The Clevers. O trio central  Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos e Wanderlia  entrou em cena justamente quando come?ava a se acentuar a queda de popularidade dos primeiros artistas brasileiros do rocknroll. Em 1961, Celly Campelo decidiu afastar-se da vida artstica, enquanto as aten??es se voltavam para a bossa nova e, nos meios de comunica??o, sobreviviam poucos espa?os: o programa Hoje  Dia de Rock, de Jair de Taumaturgo, na Radio Mayrink Veiga carioca; o Clube do Rock, de Carlos Imperial, na TV-Rio, e Crush em Hi-Fi, na TV Record, de S?o Paulo. Em discos, os sucessos rareavam: Marcianita, com Srgio Murilo, Diana, com Carlos Gonzaga. Roberto Carlos optou, ent?o, por algum tempo, pela bossa nova, mas Erasmo Carlos e Wanderlia decidiram insistir, tentando divulgar um tipo de musica que, nessa poca, j tinha muito de bolero e samba-can??o, misturado ao ritmo do rocknroll. No Rio de Janeiro RJ, Ed Wilson, Cleide Alves, Renato e seus Blue Caps tambm esperavam sua oportunidade. Foi o repentino sucesso de um compositor e intrprete radicado em S?o Paulo que abriu a brecha para o que seria a Jovem Guarda: em 1963, Ronnie Cord conseguiu bons ndices de venda e popularidade com o rock Rua Augusta (de Herv Cordovil), chamando a aten??o do publico e dos homens de media para as figuras de Roberto Carlos e Erasmo Carlos, principalmente, autores de Parei na contram?o. Em seguida,  proibido fumar e Festa de arromba (da mesma dupla) confirmaram a existncia do mercado. Foi dessa msica  onde os dois celebram textualmente seus companheiros de vida artstica e preferncia musical  que surgiu a idia de um programa de televis?o, concretizado pela TV Record paulista, na poca grande investidora em musica popular. Inicialmente o programa deveria chamar-se Festa de Arromba e ocuparia uma hora ociosa, a tarde de domingo, vaga desde a proibi??o de transmiss?o dos jogos de futebol.     Com o nome definitivo de Jovem Guarda, o programa foi ao ar pela primeira vez em setembro de 1965, reunindo Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos e Wanderlia, os cantores Eduardo Arajo, Srgio Murilo, Agnaldo Rayol, Reynaldo Rayol, Martinha, Cleide Alves, Meyre Pav?o, Rosemary e os grupos The Jordans, The Jet Blacks, Renato e seus Blue Caps, Os Incrveis e Golden Boys. Rapidamente, a Jovem Guarda tornou-se uma das grandes atra??es da emissora, reunindo grandes platias de adolescentes no Teatro Record, mas foi a partir de 1966, com o grande sucesso de Roberto Carlos e Erasmo Carlos Quero que v tudo pro inferno, que o programa tomou propor??es nacionais e passou a ser sin?nimo de movimento ou tendncia musical. Outros artistas se juntaram ao grupo inicial: Ronnie Von, Vanusa, De Kalafe, Deny e Dino, Leno e Lilian, Ant?nio Marcos, Os Vips, Os Bras?es, The Pops, entre outros. Seguindo o exemplo da Apple, promotora dos Beatles, a agncia de publicidade Magaldi, Maia & Prosperi passou a coordenar industrialmente a imagem do trio central da Jovem Guarda, criando as marcas Calhambeque, Tremend?o e Ternurinha para uma srie de produtos que ia de bonecas a cal?as e blusas.     Vrios compositores de outras reas come?aram ent?o a se interessar pelos ritmos da Jovem Guarda, como Jorge Ben, que passou a freqentar o programa, e os baianos Gilberto Gil e Caetano Veloso, que, aconselhados pela cantora Maria Bethania, incorporaram ao seu trabalho elementos do i-i-i, como as guitarras que acompanhavam Domingo no parque e Alegria, alegria, no III FMPB, da TV Record, em 1967.     Segundo Erasmo Carlos, foi justamente a Tropiclia  movimento que Gil e Caetano fundaram nesse perodo  uma das principais causas do esvaziamento da Jovem Guarda. "A Tropiclia  diz ele  era uma Jovem Guarda com conscincia das coisas, e nos deixou num branco total". Mas, antes de se extinguir totalmente no inicio de 1969, diluda pela superexposi??o ao consumo, pelo cansa?o e esgotamento criativo de seus participantes e pelos prejuzos que levaram Magaldi, Maia & Prosperi a desistir dos esquemas comerciais, a Jovem Guarda deixou sua contribui??o, alimentando vrios programas semelhantes na televis?o, como a Festa do Bolinha, de Jair de Taumaturgo, na TV-Rio carioca, e publica??es especializadas, como a revista Reis do i-i-i, sucessora do que a Revista do rock tinha sido para o rocknroll brasileiro na dcada de 1950. Alm de projetar nacionalmente alguns de seus dolos, o movimento foi em grande parte responsvel pela posterior assimila??o de instrumentos eletr?nicos na musica brasileira de todas as tendncias e pela fus?o de informa??es estrangeiras e dados nacionais que caracterizou a produ??o musical na dcada de 1970.     No inicio da dcada seguinte, Lo Jaime, os Tit?s, a Blitz e outros interpretes e grupos roqueiros retomaram a musicalidade simples e direta da Jovem Guarda, constituindo a Nova Jovem Guarda. Em 1995, remanescentes da Jovem Guarda se reuniram para comemorar os 30 anos do

K2ldt1dwaa	Basically, any 2 or more notes played or sounded at the same time would make a chord. Common misconceptions about what a chord is: it has to be a mixture of 3 or 4 (for seventh chords) notes, they have to be tertian chords (members of the chord have to be a third above or below each other), and they can be only major, minor, augmented, or diminished. These ideas are wrong. Any 2 or more notes played together can be called a chord (even if the two notes are of the same pitch class). The reason why the term "chord" gives almost everyone a notion that it is a tertian mixture of 3 or 4 notes is because that is the common practice for most classical composers, however; the true meaning of "chord" is what I have stated above.    If you are pertaining to common chords used in tonal music, then I can teach you how to make chords with any note as a root (the main center of the chord).   First, pick any note; this will be your "root".    For major chords, find the note 4 steps above the first note (include black keys in your counting). This is the "third" of your chord. Then find the note 3 steps above the second note. This is the "fifth" of your chord. Example, C-E-G is a major C chord. (C)    For minor chords, take the major chord, then move the third one step down. Example, C-Eb-G is a minor C chord. (Cm)    For augmented chords, take the major chord, then move the fifth one step up. Example, C-E-G  is an augmented C chord. (Caug)    For diminished chords, take the minor chord, then move the fifth one step down. Example, C-Eb-Gb is a diminished C chord. (Cdim)    To make dominant seventh chords, take the major chord and add a note 11 steps above your root. Ex. C-E-G-B = C dominant7 (C7)    To make major seventh chords, take the major chord and add a note 10 steps above your root. Ex. C-E-G-Bb = C major7 (CM7)    To make minor seventh chords, take the minor chord, and add a note 10 steps above your root. Ex. C-Eb-G-Bb = C minor7 (Cm7)    To make half-diminished seventh chords, take the diminished chord, and add a note 10 steps above your root. Ex. C-Eb-Gb-Bb = C half-diminished7 (Chdim7)    To make wholly-diminished seventh chords, take the diminished chord, and add a note 9 steps above your root. Ex. C-Eb-Gb-Bbb (or A) = C diminished7 (Cdim7)    You may invert your chords. Inversion means to raise the lowest note of your chord by an octave. C-E-G can be inverted to E-G-C and G-C-E, without changing the name of the chord. If the root is the lowest note of the chord, it is called "root position chord". If the third is the lowest note of the chord, it is called "first inversion". If the fifth is the lowest note of the chord, it is called "second inversion". If the seventh is the lowest, it is called "third inversion".    This works for any chord with any root. This may seem to be complicated at first, but once you master this then you can spell any tonal music chord with ease.  |`|eulMjLtPaa	A chord is three or more notes.

VxozKUcCaa	Well you brought the subject up........    When I was in Jr. high, all I wanted was a girl with big boobs.    In high school, I dated a girl with big boobs, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate girl.  In college, I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency, she cried all the time. So I decided I needed a girl with some stability.  I found a very stable girl, but she was boring. She never got excited about anything. So I decided I needed a girl with some excitement.  I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She was directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some ambition.  After college, I found an ambitious girl and married her. She was so ambitious, she divorced me and took everything I owned.    Now all I want is a girl with big boobs.  ___________________________________  Why men dont write advice columns?    Dear Walter,   I hope you can help me here.  The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual.  I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt.  I walked back home to get my husband's help.  When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbors daughter.  I am 41, my husband is 44, and the neighbor's daughter is 22.   We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he admitted that they had been having an affair for the past six months.  I told him to stop or I would leave him.  He was made redundant from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless.  I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant.  He won't go to counseling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore.  Can you please help?   Sincerely,   Sheila     Dear Sheila:   A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a number of faults with the engine.  Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line.  If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires.  If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.   I hope this helps,   Walter|`|Y1aAGPURaa	A baby turtle was standing at the bottom of a large tree and with a deep sigh, started to climb. About an hour later, he reached a very high branch and walked along to the end. He turned and spread all four flippers and launched himself off the branch. On landing at the bottom in a pile of soft, dead leaves, he shook himself off, walked back to the bottom of the tree and with a sigh started to climb.    About an hour later, he again reached the very high branch, walked along, turned, spread his flippers and flung himself off the branch. Again, he landed on the bottom, shook himself off, went to the bottom of the tree, sighed and started climbing.     Watching these proceedings from the end of the branch were two little birds.

mwEBrwlOaa	It is one thing for a couple to tape their escapades but it is another thing to film a threesome. The reason being the legal consequences if you do. In a threesome situation you will have to show that you had obtained consent from the participants and you disclosed to them how you were going to use the taping. If you publish it on the internet you may run into issues such damages due to the fact you did not fully disclose how you were going to use the taping or if you are paid for the tape then you may have to share in money made between the three of you.     My advice is unless you are willing to pay an attorney a few hundred dollars to draft a release and pay the participants something for being recorded then it is not worth the consequences that taping may bring you at a later date.

hJP9y6kjaa	If you mean from a moral or intellectual or emotional standpoint, absolutely not.    Parents have been lamenting the corruption of the youth since the ancient Greeks.... the fact is that children will be similar to their parents, and different in other ways. It is the inability of the parents to accept change that threatens their sensibilities, not the actions of the children themselves. Over thousands of years conservative elements have decried various and sundry social activities, movements, trends, etc as things that would threaten the morals of their children... yet generations later, they all seemed to turn out okay!    Look at Elvis. We adore him these days, he's imitated world-wide, his songs are widely accepted. At one time, though, conservative elements of society (especially religious ones, it always seems to be the religious ones) protested vociferously against his "lewd" stage performance... he shook his hips! Gasp! The youth will be corrupted! Decades later, it's tough to find someone who dances *without* shaking their hips at least a little!    Do some people (kids and adults!) take the imagery, lyrics, and content of music and go to far with it? Absolutely, and it's a da*n shame.    But who is responsible? They are. They chose to "buy in" to the persona, the image, the lifestyle. If they are children and they really don't know better, then what can be said? Who are the people in charge of instilling not only moral values, ie what is right and what is wrong, but instilling the ability to differentiate between what is *real* and what *isn't*?    Parents spend more time with their children than anyone else does... that means that children learn from their parents more than any other. If parents can't or won't differentiate between what is real and what isn't (ie won't apply a logical/rational filter to the world around them), then their children won't either.    Personally, I point the finger at religion. If you go to the extreme of removing rational thought and logic from your spiritual beliefs, then is it any wonder that your children will follow in your footsteps and not apply a rational filter to the world around them? Obviously there are many good, intelligent, perfectly rational Christians out there (80% of Americans profess Christianity?) there are a whole lot who are walking cluster-f***s, and so many who want to believe so badly in a personal savior that they're willing to suspend all disbelief and buy into any load of crap that a guy in a nice suit or funny hat will sell them.    Anyways, I don't see music as the corrupter of society. Parents need to take personal accountability for any lack of morals or inability a child may have to differentiate between what's real (rappers say crazy s**t to make money) and what isn't (rappers don't really go around shooting nearly as many people as they say they do, for instance).      Saul|`|18K7ucsEaa	NO! Most youths today rely on music as a way to her messages that they can relate to. There is an argument to be made that music with explicit lyrics can corrupt young ones, but as long as they have self-control, it shouldn't be a problem...    :-D|`|P0jxi2Huaa	I know for a fact that music is ruining my ability to hear properly :) Damned earphones and concerts!|`|N2hMFrlYaa	Agree with Jessi, Worked with bands for over 20 years, and my hearing has suffered, todays music is louder than what I used to work with although the hse regulations should limit the levels.|`|DphUE9tbaa	People have been arguing about that since rock 'n roll came in in the 50s.  You could argue that sometimes it does - kids impersonating ignorant rappers is not a good thing.  Then again, mods and rockers having pitched battles in the 60s was even less of a good thing, but it did not seem to have a long-term effect.  Those people grew out of it.  My feeling is that its impact is overplayed.  Most people just treat it as entertainment.

l9gR5lgMaa	I don't think it's too bad on stereotypes. they have like. the slutty cheerleader, the upset emo chick, the jock that's a complete jerk,  but in the newest season they've gotten rid of that.     I don't think they're really that huge stereotypes because they dont say like.. every cheerleader is a ****, or every jock is a jerk, but just focus on one character with those characteristics.|`|nOtGVyTVaa	I dont think they use sterotypes at all the whole purpose of the characters is to show the different sides to every person, and show tha what you see on the outside is not what the person actually is, for example at the begining of the series you think that Brooke is just a slutty popular cheerleader, but she actually has hope dreams and problems just like everyone else and she just uses that as a mask to cover up her issues, and also if tree hill was a real place in season 1, Dan may look like an overall popular important man (he did get elected mayor after all) and he actually has A LOT of issues, and Haley seems like your typical straight A student, but she just wants to be loved like everyone else, and Peyton has a lot of different sides to her, she's a cheerleader, and she is sad a lot, because she has a lot of crappy things happen to her.  And all throughout the series, you see them change and develop just like everyone else. I could go on forever because I love the show so much, but I spare you :)

Mmmmm  Nobody's talkin',  'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin'.  Ohhh...  And now is I'm yellin' over her,  She's yellin' over me.  All that that means  Is neither of us is listening,  (And what's even worse).  That we don't even remember why were fighting.    So both of us are mad for...    [Hook]    Nothin'  (Fighting for).  Nothin'  (Crying for).  Nothin'  (Whoahhh).  But we won't let it go for  Nothin'  (No not for)  Nothin'.  This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.  Ohhh, baby...    I know sometimes  It's gonna rain...  But baby, can we make up now  'Cause I can't sleep through the pain  (Cant sleep through the pain).    [Chorus]    Girl, I don't wanna go to bed  (Mad at you),  And I don't want you to go to bed  (Mad at me).  No, I don't wanna go to bed  (Mad at you),  And I don't want you to go to bed  (Mad at me)  Ohhh no no no...    [Verse 2]    And it gets me upset, girl  When you're constantly accusing.  (Askin' questions like you've already known).  We're fighting this war, baby  When both of us are losing.  (This ain't the way that love is supposed to go).    Whoaaaaaaaaa...  [What happened to workin' it out].  We've falled into this place  Where you ain't backin' down  And I ain't backin' down.    So what the hell do we do now...  It's all for...    [Hook]    Nothin'  (Fighting for).  Nothin'  (Crying for).  Nothin'  (Whoahhh).  But we won't let it go for  Nothin'  (No not for)  Nothin'.  This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.  Ohhh, baby...    I know sometimes  It's gonna rain...  But baby, can we make up now  'Cause I can't sleep through the pain  (Cant sleep through the pain).    [Chorus]    Girl, I don't wanna go to bed  (Mad at you),  And I don't want you to go to bed  (Mad at me).  No, I don't wanna go to bed  (Mad at you),  And I don't want you to go to bed  (Mad at me)  Ohhh no no no...    [Bridge]    Oh baby this love ain't gonna be perfect,  (Perfect, perfect, oh oh).  And just how good it's gonna be.  We can't fuss and we can't fight  Long as everything alright between us  Before we go to sleep.    Baby, we're gonna be happy.    I know sometimes  It's gonna rain...  But baby, can we make up now  'Cause I can't sleep through the pain  (Cant sleep through the pain).    [Chorus]    Girl, I don't wanna go to bed  (Mad at you),  And I don't want you to go to bed  (Mad at me).  No, I don't wanna go to bed  (Mad at you),  And I don't want you to go to bed  (Mad at me)  Ohhh no no no...
6113592ee4cd8092af2e3a43a226cb9daa	To make us miserable, that's why.    In actuality, Gossip Girl has aired an number of episodes this season already and needs time to catch up with filming before they can air more.  if they didn't wait and had shot everything, the season would likely end in March rather than in May like usual.  I assume this is the same with One Tree Hill.|`|2kpr2arRaa	they moved the Big Ratings Sweeps to Late Feb Early March--    The Sweeps ratings are the ones that Really count- they are the ones the TV industry uses to determine how much a tv network can charge the Advertisers for commericals duing a certain show or timeslot    the Higher the Ratings the more $$$ they can charge- TV is a For Profit Busine$$|`|ATb5iWoXaa	Because they suck.|`|S62Z33Ygaa	well i think its becuz they have to extend the seasons  becuz if they showed all the eps then the season would be over in april   gossip girl only has maybe 6-7 (idk) more episodes until they season finale  so yeah just my guess  it'd make sense haha

Similar words are bloodclart which is like a cloth a woman would use to handle her period quite a while back.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	THAT URBAN DICTIONARY - Update is better British Guy! =)    How can I say this in a clean way??    Rass = A$$    Clat - Sanitary napkin.    Examples:     "Me nah wah yo rassclat wuk"    "I don't want your nasty a$$/dirty a$$/low class - job"    In  "true" Rastafarianism - if a woman is on her menses she should not be around the men as its considered as her "cleansing time"|`|LgNqYUECaa	Um, try here.

9gRikg8Kaa	if you can't read it, who cares. i play guitar, piano, and drums. it took me a while to read music too. but i also learned a helluva lot more from learning by ear.|`|q8v1jAF2aa	It helps if you have a good teacher. I myself did, what a wonderful man, and i now perform with a band regularly. :)  Just takes time x|`|jm2ppj62aa	you don't need to learn about instruments, in high school i just didn't pay attention or slept in music class, i have been playing guitar for about 8 months and i can learn most songs, just look up tabs or do it by ear|`|L55jPx8iaa	just play your guitar as often as you can. before you know it you'll be playing stuff you never thought you could and then you'll realize how much there is left to learn. it's awesome.|`|P0jxi2Huaa	no, you'll just be pretty rubbish at it for a while, but nobody starts out perfect. You don't really need to read notation either so long as you can read tabs which I personally find a lot easier to follow anyways.|`|yxVN1Etaaa	when i started playin guitar. i had music experience at all. now i can say that i am an accomplished guitarist and songwriter.     the point is: just go for it... everyone's gotta start somewhere|`|bUOV2I1eaa	i know no theory and im awesome|`|5G4cRjA5aa	Not necessarily. I was 12 before I started playing the guitar and I couldn't read music that well. Just follow the chord diagrams/tab and stick with it. You'll get there eventually and tab is very easy to read :).    Mikhaela|`|AA12353869	How are you gonna be good before you begin? You don't need to be able to read music to play an instrument....good luck to you.|`|wrGN5BNmaa	No. I have zero musical ability and I can play a couple of songs on the guitar.

f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Stormtroopers... they are called stormtroopers ;) A subtle allusion to World War II occurred on Tatooine in Phantom Menace. While Qui-Gon, Jar Jar and Padm were busy in Mos Espa, Obi-Wan received a radio broadcast from Naboo pleading for help. He warned the Queen and Captain Panaka not to reply to this message, never realizing that the Queen was an imposter. However, someone on the ship transmitted a reply, enabling Darth Maul to trace it. The person who actually sent the transmission is never shown. This is a direct reference to the highly elaborate and secretive radio interception and decryption services employed by both England and Germany, including the North African campaign (Tunisia, where the scenes were actually filmed).      Here is an article on the WW2 allegories in Star Wars.    http://www.geocities.com/starwarstika/|`|IIa4efh5aa	Well, the fact that the guys in the white armor are callded Imperial Storm Troopers ought to be a clue. Certainly Darth Vader's headgear owes a debt to Wehrmacht-issue helmets. And uniforms like those worn by Grand Moff Tarkin also echo Nazi design.

That's what they use to attach beards and it is HARD to get off.

I try not to be mean, though my hatred of such poorly written tripe sometimes comes through and I bash the books.  Mainly because they proclaim them to be the best books ever, and as someone who loves to read, I can't stand it.    Books & Authors is overrun with twilight fans. I don't even go to that section anymore because it's just too much.    We can only hope that Twilight fans will disappear since nothing new is going to come out until the next movie that is.    What mainly annoys me is the same  question asked over and over: What's your favorite Twilight character? Team Edward or Team Jacob? OMG EDWARD IS SOOOOOO HAWWWWWT!    Do they not know how to use search?    .......    Sorry went off on a rant there a bit.|`|X11j9qe5aa	Hmm if I see them posting the twilight question on comic and animation again I will press the report button. But that kind of mean :(  I don't know what to do. I mean I understand it's annoying    Edit: Hmm most of the answer got a thumb down. *wonder who did it*  LOL Twilight fan attack XD|`|v1hCymAEaa	I like tracking down the questions because they do not belong here. Usually the first question I see gets off lucky considering it hasnt annoyed me as much yet. But my response is usually:    WRONG SECTION (see in BIG letters for a reason)    Last time I checked Twilight is neither a comic or animation, this question should be asked in the books and authors or movies sections.    And what is up with all the thumbs down?! I liked all your guy's answers so thumbs up from me!    :-P|`|k4iehRa8aa	I hunt them down then give them a link to the same question.|`|DksKPjHsaa	Yes yes yes yes yes! Oh my gosh it is so annoying when these crazed Twilight fans are posting in the comics and animation section! Grr!    I once talked to somone (Who was in love with naruto and anime before)     Her: "Um... I moved on from anime .. I found something better"  Me: "What?"  Her: "Twilight"    I was so pissed off TT___TT     Thats like one of the main reasons I hate Twilight.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	This is my common new answer to them:     Oh dear, what are we going to do with you?   It seems like another fan has misplaced their question.    Please, repost your question in Books and Authors (go under Arts and Humanities, you shall find it) or Movies. They probably don't want you there, so maybe Jokes and Riddles will do. Just not Comics and Animation.    Is Twilight a comic? Well, it IS comical, but it is indeed no comic.    Is Twilight an animation? Well, the animation/special effects in the movie are extremely poor and cannot be called animation.    So, find the proper category. We are sick of Twilight fans.    Thank you.   Goodbye.    P.S. Do not blame your computer.      They never get the message though.      Edit: Darn the fans, darn them! Why can thay not leave us be? Arg!|`|Kgrq92Veaa	I have given a variety of answers from politly asking them to repost there question to almost performing a flippin excorsim on one of them but it is overly fun to hunt them down|`|wdxUb3moaa	hai,hai    not sure cz every time we tell one to knock it off and to correctly categorize the question...another dummy does the same thing....on and on and on!     makez me mad :P    ~(^..^)    it might  be yahoo's fault for automatically picking this section but even than they should be able to do it manually!|`|TkPJYlaMaa	It;s dang annoying. I've thought of reporting them,but then I just say in big letter STOP POSTING THESE QUESTION HERE!!!!!  I don't think it's worked, but it's a start|`|HRQjffv8aa	^_^" i say its really annoying and pissing alot of people off, they should post that in their own sections..then i usually say how badly written it was >.> there were grammar errors ad stuffs and =.= i always state that sparkly vampire thing >.    but yeah i have to agree with Mat >.|`|yMjocqmUaa	I always say,    "Wrong section much?"    Its an easy way to make a few points na dTwilight isn't a comic or animation and it pisses me off..|`|4nwBCFiuaa	~Heey BWA!!~    ya..the number of Twilight qs kinda went down..but there's still some..-____-    >> Lol..  it really depends what mood i am in...xD  if it was the first Twilight question i see for that day, then i would kindly tell them that they are in the wrong section..etc..  BUT...if i'm in an annoyed and bad mood..then..hehe...i'll be mean to those guys...by giving them a "not so kind" answer...  and also, i would give a "not so kind" answer if i see the question more than once a day...  yesterday ...or the day before..i saw 4 New Moon question about edward in 30 mins!!!  i got really annoyed.......  i'm gonna continue posting those answers....xD    =P    those Twilight obsessed fans are making me hate Twilight now....-_____-    Lol..yup..that's what i say....  =]|`|VKRmIj6Gaa	I just tell them in a polite but straight forward way that it's stupid to ask Twilight questions in the Comics and Animation section because it has nothing to do with either of those things!!!! Lol, it's just so dumb... theres a books&authors section as well as a movies section and yet they refuse to go to either of those sections? WTF is wrong with them... *breathes* phew.. almost got a little angry there!... *puts down gun*    Like your new pic too!|`|JgCGpQaxaa	I feel kind of sorry telling people to post their answers in B&A.  I mean, there are some really nice people over there, and it seems by telling the Twilight fanbrats to go over there is really quite cruel to the regs of B&A.    So I'm just going to start telling them to leave Yahoo Answers all together.  I think a nice Twilight Forum where their retarded spew is welcome by their own kind would be the perfect place for them.  And then we can lock that little corner of the internet up for good, and throw away the key.|`|2ogFk4Amaa	Yes! exactly brother!|`|MX0s76pzaa	I find twilight questions extremely annoying, especially when the movie first came out. Once I saw like 5 questions on a single page, and I was like >.> I'm glad It's died down.|`|4SV4bz69aa	twilight is amazing and there are soooo many fans towards the books and movie and actors/actresses/directors, and these questions are great because fans love to answer them and read them and be obsessed cuz they are obsessed. im obsessed. and not ashamed.  soooo yeah. stop.|`|2loHOHhsaa	in fkin tired of those questoins. there just those people that think what ever that guys name is hot and all theat crap.,t hey need to stop cause no one givs a sheit.

d2RV8HTmaa	It's not necessarily EVERYONE that has ever been on the island that has to go back.  It has something to do with what happened to the island when the Oceanic 6 left....maybe when Ben turned the wheel.  Walt was already gone at that time so it doesn't involve him.    That said, it does seem like there should be a storyline going concerning Walt, because he knows that the plane didn't go down in the ocean and that there were other survivors than the 06.  Is Walt just keeping mum about what he knows?  Poor guy.    Another thing....I'm wondering if Frank, the pilot, will also have to return.  He was with the 06 and is somewhere back in the real world.  Seems like he should be the one to fly them back.|`|qN6Bq0Emaa	you forgot Charles Widmore... he was also on the island..  I'm betting he has to go back too no?      At the end, I'm betting that Widmore, Desmond, wife and toddler Charlie are back on the island. For some reason, Walt is waayyy under the radar. But I would think he HAS to go back too. that's why they're bringing back Locke's body.    I'm  not betting on Aaron going back. grandma just popped up....|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Bless you. I have been saying this for weeks. Poor Walt is an orphan now and he's been forgotten by all his 'former friends." I hate to say it's because he is black, but I can't imagine them forgetting Aaron and stashing him away with his grandma. It's so sad for poor Walt. Walt was so "special" on the island..is he no longer special????|`|DUg1IkTIaa	The Oceanic Six is where 6 people left the island at the same time, which apparently is too many at the same time and caused a rift of some sort.  They need to return to the island to establish some stability.|`|14c690b99c03a819fd4f7cbcd14bac5eaa	I don't know if that includes Walt or not.  My co-worker and I have discussed this and Ben's comment on 'everyone has to go back' is pretty loose...I mean Michael died on the ship.  Also, does that mean that Desmond and Frank have to go back too?  They weren't on the plane, but they were on the island; Desmond was there for a long while.  Just another thing to ponder until they answer it for us.|`|D0vv2HSAaa	Walt doesn't really matter because he was let off the island by Ben and I think his contract was up!! Ha Ha.  Isn't lost the best show on television!!!|`|PAzDgYOXaa	they didnt forget he grew up way to fast and they wrote him out of the script and ben isnt suposed to  get to go back to the island  its not that the island needs him ben needs them|`|LBovv7Sxaa	the writers have confirmed that Walt will appear in season 5.    so hold your horses! :D    and Ben's not part of the 6, but he's the one who knows pretty much EVERYTHING about the island.  i'd definitely want him with me if i were the 6.|`|6YvkP2sGaa	because the actor doesn't want to come back or can't?  i find it odd that they have forgotten him.  i also find this whole story line a little stupid.  i remember way back when when they said everything would scientifically make sense, and i could have sworn they ruled out time travel.

iuWfp2fEaa	I like this one better:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCMWRGvg4...|`|nkmwGAKjaa	Guess they don't like anything that "smacks" of violence.  Wish they had YAz back in the day!|`|QBFjMRfuaa	I have today and i wanted to crawl her eyes out she was making me soooo mad|`|AAwe5WbVaa	haha yaz:) she is a know it all|`|oxWpo4bqaa	Violence is never the answer.    But its okay to want to smack some b*tches.|`|BhQSTvLsaa	Oh, but NOW it posts!    Hehe! Sucks to be you!|`|w1pbRmazaa	it just hates you i guess and hell yes everybody has|`|YBtjP5Gzaa	because if u hav a question it only shows up on other people computers|`|wcp1uvgtaa	I don't want to smack anyone, but I remember that ad. It's very annoying. I could never stand to be around someone like that after the lunch date. It's pure narcissism.|`|vzWGml26aa	that yaz is one funny commercial. i noticed a lot of your questions got deleted. there is nothing wrong with a little humor|`|iwONPromaa	Who do you want me to get Catz..I will get em good for ya..x|`|uwtvDgxCaa	I think they just did cute little kitty in the charming hat!|`|mJRYh0URaa	no sh!t catz|`|DPLjIsSaaa	They do. lolz|`|e7eb28bb492c5eedd55da24da0a04504aa	It's not Yahoo that is removing the question...it is somebody else that is reporting your question as violation to the site...Go to Yahoo Answer's site and go down to the bottom of the page...click community guideline's and it will list all of the rule's of the site.|`|4KDcxFWGaa	They probably consider the smacking as words that is part of their screening process  protocol. They may consider that as an act that may or may not incite violence. Or they are just too sensitive. :)|`|fx6pNJ5saa	LOL!  That chick has the low down on some Yaz!  I don't have any friends so I'm not in danger of smacking anyone.|`|MCOlkzk6aa	you are lucky.  Someone likes to delete my songs and questions.  :)|`|jDqpiEcOaa	ditto|`|fdP9UJOsaa	lol why does this commercial bother you?  ... and i have to agree with you on this one, they violate allot of questions for silly reasons. It can also be other people who reported your question.|`|8nm2psyKaa	No its not a violation but there are trolls here so you never know what a violation is going to be with them|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	Maybe you have a "troll" following you and reporting all your questions? Just a thought?     The Yaz commercial is really no different than any other drug commercial...they are all annoying, but they really have no other way of presenting the information about the drugs. There are far more annoying commercials out there, in my opinion!
42DjF8Ckaa	Yes, I really think you're right. Deleting it is really not necessary; I think it's doing a little too much, getting over indulgent and not polite to do something like that. I really appreciate how thoughtful you are of others and how compassionate you are. Great seeing you:)|`|b6OEaFx3aa	yea its mean|`|23DiWU58aa	absolutely! ok, some of the questions are very nasty, as in 'politics' , where they can be used simply to rant,but most dont deserve to be deleted|`|RzhbINzeaa	who cares, this is the internet, so brush yo shoulders off.  contact yahoo customer care so they can post it back if you feel so strongly about that.|`|50UbJp14aa	yes i think so|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Yes, the whole point of the exercise is to gain knowledge and share opinions. Whatever happened to free speech?|`|DSp6zjeGaa	yeah i agree|`|8VFKvFqPaa	i do to!!!!|`|l8H9AakMaa	I KNOW, Y DONT THEY JUST NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION, ITS JUST RUDE|`|4wHjtkJXaa	it is wrong  '  but how do you know the poster didnt delete it herself/himself?|`|omAtDbSKaa	i agree with the othr person above ..its just the internet lol u dnt need 2 get all wrkd up about it =D|`|C5QV222iaa	yeah that is wrong, and very very annoying.
d23F89ECaa	Always ask to hand it directly to the manager.  Not only will it ensure he or she gets the damn thing, you will have that opportunity to make that first impression on your terms.    Getting a bartending gig is all about how you conduct yourself, the first impression you make will make or break what the manager does after you go home.    As for giving your application to the bartender, it's not your best option.  Bartenders seldom work under any manager supervision and seldom actually see their manager.  On top of that, they have allot to do and allot to constantly think of.  Remembering to pass on your application to a manager who is not there, will be the last of his or hers concerns.    Case in point, I work in one of the most prestigious bars in St. John's.  The Bella Vista.  Every bartender in the city wants to work there.  A young lad came in and gave me a resume and asked me to pass it onto my manager.  That was Saturday afternoon.  I completely forgot about it and wouldn't be the least bit shocked if it is still under my cash register.|`|mggll8dRaa	Talk to the Manager....!!|`|Bwqjrijhaa	Wear a low-cut top and ask for the manager..........always worked for me|`|RtJ11zUZaa	Wait.  Some bartenders are very possessive of "their bar" and will do things to prevent you from getting the job even if they'd like you once they got to know you.|`|mwv79AIhaa	i say u get the app, fill it out at home..then bring it back when the managers there....this way he can put that pretty face to ur qualifications..its sure to get u the job.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	I never tended a bar but I hve tended to a few bartenders.lol. Use all your skillz. Speaking to a representative is a good way to have a jealous possessive bartender throw that application right out. I seen it happen. Wait till the manager is there show up the way you need to. aah huh. You will be hired on the spot.   Lemon drop martini coming up.|`|EVwllMNqaa	Manager,    so he/she can see and talk to you. If they see you and talk to you two thing can happen..you can see if you really want to work for this a$$..and he can see if he wants your a$$ to work for him.
bNRUjnGZaa	I say face the world with a smile on your face and determination in your heart.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	No, actually I find being happy for others during my own hard times to be healing in a way..we all know the hard times are transient..not always to be fought either.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	no, not at all|`|CzyKzwDLaa	Sometimes.  Depending on who the person is.  For example, if someone is a real jerk who doesn't deserve anything then yeah I get a little pissed.  But if the person is good than I believe they deserve it.  I'm a firm believer in karma.|`|bwHWizWyaa	No, I am happy when others around me are happy.
kzoUGdg0aa	Because American's have extreme views on all topics.|`|m1JyB08Raa	because in america we PRIDE ourselves on telling other people what to do.|`|5jINw4PGaa	I don't know. I'm pro choice.|`|jN0HJ4Zraa	abortion takes a human life|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Because abortion is a terrible thing. Killing an innocent life isn't what I call the "normal" thing.|`|gli7SbBoaa	I guess in America we love to butt into other people's business.  Abortion is no problem in my eyes.|`|lPgm30J1aa	A woman should definatley have the choice. Especially at a young age (aka highschool) imagine "accidentally" getting pregnant, then having to go to school with a huge stomach. The baby can't hear  or feel anything yet. Sure it's sad. But it's DEF the womans choice.|`|aPnjb8JGaa	Because historically we have been a largely conservative country that was founded and largely dominated by Republicans.  Republicans are largely made up of pro-life supporters (anti-abortion people), and since they are a large part of the country, people get uptight about it.  My ex-boyfriend grew up in England and from what I learned from him, most people seemed to have the political attitudes of the Democrats back in America, who are largely pro-choice.  Americans are more than likely more uptight about abortion than the English because the majority of their political ideals reflect pro-life sentiments, while the English follow the Democrat ideals (in general).|`|yFPH1d5Laa	women should always have the choice  nuff said.|`|4wHjtkJXaa	Cause were HArd in the UK.|`|rD3b5CETaa	because America's a b*tch.    my view on abortion is that the mother should get to choose.  it's not murder if the baby isn't even born yet folks.|`|Nmshh2KAaa	I guess they care more about live there sorry...i really love England.....but i think they should consider thinking about not having abortion cause its a terrible thing to do.......im agsinst it and killing an innocent child is murder......we need to give them a chance at life!!!|`|Wfvqyilcaa	A lot of things in America are considered more taboo than in European cultures. We tend to be a nation of prudeness and censorships. People of European countries seem to be much more comfortable in their society and cultures that such old concepts like abortion, and nakedness are not an issue. People from European countries seem to be much more established in their beliefs.|`|Fhu6dcIeaa	The United States has a lot of conservative people who believe everyone should live under a certain "rules". They also think if you don't talk about it, it won't happen. I live in the south east part of the US, and it is considered to be part of "the bible belt". "The bible belt is located along the southern parts of the US from texas all the way over to virginia. They still live by the ways of the bible and have a hard time accepting the fact that not all people live by those rules.    it sucks a lot of the times, people can be very judgmental, although this happens everywhere, its way more common here. I find it kind of aggravating myself, I watch the TV show Degrassi, which is filmed in Canada, and in one episode a girl has an abortion, they wouldn't air that episode of the television show in the US.|`|qRtYPAUwaa	Stop being stereotypical.  =O      Simply put, the United States has a higher percentage of Christians.|`|G3czAd0caa	i'm not english nor american   well i'm half american   idrk but i think that most teenagers get pregnant so they want to get an abortion all the time in the UK so it's not a big deal there|`|FDt7cC8haa	We brush and floss here...so what's your point?|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Becuase Americans exaggerate and over-analyse everything|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	That must mean THE UK women are very much slutishh...not all americans are 'upright' you know.|`|k0dZeYQ6aa	excuse me?|`|36zm5zK8aa	first, don't generalize. second, no matter where you are from, its killing a life. however a country accepts the murder is up to the individuals living there.|`|AA10838250	thou shall not kill, in any country
3O2SfwIBaa	Look I'm a leo too. and i don't have many close friends just a few, but they are very good friends. some times i feel like a loner too. it's not that i don't like people i just find that they want to be my friend more than i want to be there friend and i feel kind of smothered by them so i back off to the point that they think i've died or something. they say leo's have a lot of friends, but the real word is associates. we associate with alot of people and others find us warm open honest and a bit crazy so they generally like us and want to be around. i hope i've answered your question. it's hard as every one is different dispite being the same sign.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	---however they say that Leo's have ''lots'' of friends.---    well, they say this: leo has potential to have lots of friends. (since they are, if typical, social, outgoing, active people) like, if you stay at home, say, astrology gods are not going to beam to your room friends up.    ----is it my moon sign that i feel bit like a loner?----    no, your moon sign, as i said in my other answer even protecting you from depression and more intense and bad feelings than "feeling bit like a loner".    hope that helps this time.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	My moon is in Cap and I am an Aquarius sun and i have many friends i stay in touch with them, you can't blame astrology on everything it's your environment sometimes, why don't you go out and make friends got to the park or the mall if your a Leo you will always attract people.|`|KgK8z6tNaa	Umm probably not. Most likely people move on from high school. I say go out and make new ones. Hey maybe you even might find one of your high school friends that way.

2RzEaod9aa	What guys have you been talking to that like size zeros? Unless the woman is very short with a very small frame, a size zero looks unnatural because, let's face it, it is. You're a woman, you're supposed to have sexy womanly curves, not have bones jutting out everywhere, looking like an 11 year-old boy.     That's probably why the majority of people, men and women, consider a size zero to be unattractive.     As for all the people saying it's jealousy, I don't think it is. Fat people like to come up with all kinds of justifications for their fatness, and insulting a size zero is one way they can justify it. Unless you're very insecure, no one actually envies a size zero (we all want good-looking, healthy bodies and can envy those, not just a general size). What they're doing is what you did in another question: see it in black and white. They think that the only other option to obesity is to be a size zero, and since they hate size zero, they can therefore justify that it's okay to be overweight.    The problem there is that it isn't okay to starve yourself into a size zero (not all women do, as some are naturally that small, but most aren't), and it isn't okay to eat yourself into an early grave. People are so stupid when it comes to their bodies.|`|RugUki9qaa	My sister is a size zero and she is really beautiful. Maybe those women are just jealous because they are hefty.    And she ISN'T a stick. She just has a tiny frame and bone structure. She has curves that are proportionate to her body. I hate jealous women.|`|0Re4PPq9aa	I HATE A LIST SKINNY *****ES|`|OzfrMg9qaa	jealous bitches cant help themselves i guess . They are  full of flab and stretchmarks .

Guys like T and A|`|TDo1EMJkaa	I'm a guy and size zero people are unhealthy and ugly!  I'm thin myself but not that much!|`|LSXdwRDUaa	What Size Zero///|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Well that's an interesting question, but you're generalizing far too much. Only some guys like size zero women, only some women think size zero is ugly, and only some size zero women look thin and sleek.    I think most people think size zero is ugly because  1) They have no curves. Women have curves, we aren't built like little boys! If you want someone built like a boy - DATE A BOY!  2) Half the time the size zero woman looks starved to death and has a haunted expression. That's not good looking AT ALL.|`|hpJS8XOWaa	they are jealous b/c of their insecurities they aren't ugly may/b a little too thin unless they are naturally petite. Not all guys like it tho...the most I kno like a few curves. Personally, I like being a size 7 but I wish a had a lil' more muscle.|`|A5tyoUaNaa	jealousy.  and some guys do, some don't. really depends on the guy i guess.|`|4ZaAZgCgaa	I'm a guy and I think size zero girls are nasty looking.

It's never too late to start :) You just need to make sure you have a healthy and balanced diet.|`|kMSOaP9Raa	its possible  just eat less and less meat over time|`|qxHwSQTHaa	Maybe you are pregnant..?|`|2oGc1tuCaa	Yes.  It's never too late.|`|UYbNRxcqaa	of course its possible!  and since your body is naturally rejecting meat,  now is a PERFECT time to start!  im a vegetarian, and after the first 2-3 weeks of  craving meat, its so easy! and you barely notice  that meat is out of your diet!   good luck, and have fun!  your going to be saving 100 animals a year.  :]  its amazing! :]|`|yl8T9sxWaa	try smaller portions, and better prepared and presented.

RRRRRRRRRRRR!!|`|2XpIwz52aa	mabye your bodys telling you u need meat after all without it we would still be monkeys in trees|`|GeYj8lhFaa	yes i actually think thats a good idea . i mean you have all of the protein from meat so its okay if you go vegetarian cause it really wont hurt you. =)  hope i helped!!|`|bwHWizWyaa	This could indicate that you are sick.  I don't want to worry you, however my brother noticed that when he ate pork, that it made him very sick.  That was just before he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  Go see a doctor if this persists.  Don't put if off either.    Becoming a vegetarian is a mater of choice, not something that your body does.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	Yes, you can, but why would you want to.  You look far to HOT to me to do something so stupid.    How do you feel abut a big juicy hamburger or a bunch of rashers of bacon?|`|kAsfXZzVaa	im confused with ur question srry|`|QpGdfh40aa	well it may be a phase of not eating meat eat it slowly and then try eating a lot of it|`|N7mIENr2aa	maybe you just ate to much and now your body is rejecting it|`|NnXKDZIsaa	you're pregnant!|`|jDqpiEcOaa	i stopped when i was 5 when i found out what it was, take vitamins it's very important and of course you can|`|mggll8dRaa	Not a Problem...!!|`|AA10026476	Start being vegetarian and everyone in your family throws away meat.|`|lbB4lq6Daa	THAT IS JUST DUMB... those animals are meant for eating        here come the thumbs down.. i know guys, you that give me the thumbs down, the truth hurts|`|p03Jc7eHaa	i did at the age of 46|`|bvt9kvS8aa	SURE u can!!!

Nothing happend to me.  :D|`|JDUi0mbiaa	of course|`|p7NNlhJHaa	Im a vegetarian and I say if you want to stop eating meat then go for it and I think that you can become a vegetarian after all those years if your really serious about it then you can. :) hope I helped|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	good for you ... it is a great start|`|vED4iORiaa	Vegetarians won't help anyone|`|cgqgomawaa	is there any chance you might be pregnant?
jCFWPWpUaa	Never, because I'm a responsible person.  If anything goes wrong, I'm usually responsible.|`|7WlHyq8Taa	I get called it all the time...

And that is because Tiana was optimistic enough to hope that she could rouse me into proving her wrong.   All my brothers and sisters gave up on me decades ago...it's taken for granted in my family that I am and will always be happy-go-lucky and fancy-free, skipping irresponsibly down life's sheep tracks (I come from a farm - sheep tracks are like little paths that go round and about all over the place and generally end up in the middle of nowhere). One day I'll give 'em all a shock and become responsible....one day.... maybe one day I'll stop coming to P&S and go over to the folk at Philosophy or Politics.... you never know.............|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	This morning by my mother when I took my parents shopping.

rnqgiRkWaa	"YOUR UNHAPPY WITH THE RICH'S CUZ YOUR PISS POOR MORALY"        People always give the ultimatum, 'would you choose love or money' honestly why can't you have both. In most cases with rich's comes more scandal, manipulation, loss of self, and a loss of who you once where. The rich get richer while the poor still suffer.  Love is something that can't ever be toped. The one thing every single breathing human has in common is simple, to be loved and to feel wanted.  With out love there is no life but with out money there is struggle, stress and frustration.  It is hard to 'live life to the fullest' when you live to work and work to live.  I don't necessarily believe that one has to have money to be rich, one has to be satisfied with life itself and all it has to offer to be rich.    "Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people that treat you right, forget about the ones that don't and believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said it would be easy, they just promised it would be worth it."    Be grateful; don't take even the little things for granted!  Life isn't about the materialistic things, concentrating on what you drive, what you wear and who your click is pure ignorance and you tend to miss the beauty in life.  Choosing friends on the simple fact for how much money they have will not bring you happiness and you will find more knives in your back and fewer shoulders to fall on.  I see many blessed people with so much money at there finger tips but less respect for themselves.  A saying that is common but not necessarily true: "money does not buy happiness".  I never quit understood it.     I was never one to grow up with many of the finer things in life, my parents where not rich nor ready to have the responsibilities of raising children. I have struggled my whole life to get what I want. 'I will fight for what I want, but I will die for what I need'.  I am seeing more and more kids with parents well off that support all of their bad habits. And its disturbing to me, I will not lie and say I am not jealous for what they have and what they are given but I am certainly not jealous of the loose of responsibilities and maturity. I see people of all ages when it comes to money loose themselves in drugs, infidelity and self worth.  With money does come happiness if you are selective on what you use it with and who you may share it with.  You can not loose yourself, step on the ones who helped you get to the top or forget your past because you will wind up alone, unhappy and lost.     I am not saying all but most kids with money turn to drugs more than the kids shopping at the Salvation Army.  Its sad to say the least because they have so much potential to do many great things, instead they choose to live at home, take advantage of their parents money, get ****** up every night go to junior collage and sleep half the day.  Instead of taking advantage and travel, get into a great school so they can in return give their children the same life they were fortunate to have, or move out of the nest and take life by the rains.    I try and understand everything from every stand point before I make a decision or judge. I put myself in their shoes and I will love you for you, I don't care where your from or what you do, just the person inside. And if you judge me on my looks before getting to know who I truly am I feel sorry for you, make your assumptions but I promise you if you ever do get to know me I wont be who you expected|`|GFEhJYAAaa	no - money buys you saddness|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Money can get you happiness for a little while..but it will not last forever.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Money will buy me happiness but it also depends the amount of money that we will get.

eX7An0AKaa	For. Banks didn't do their jobs, and got a bailout that taxpayers have to pay. Car companies didn't do their jobs, and got a bailout that taxpayers have to pay. So if we have basically bailed everyone else out we should be getting help to since we're all the ones losing our jobs and homes.  And as much as needed. People are complaining about it being a lot, but you can't fix 8 years of destruction without doing it the full and right way or it's just useless.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	For and no clue about how much.

The way i see it you can have the sweet little respectful kids you see at the bank who listen to their mother and aren't running around , or you can have my little cousins who never listen to word their mother says and still act like rules don't exist even after you told then not to tough anything 50 times before, that's the problem.|`|fArUNIfRaa	you know whats funny?  that kids get a long with me easy because I still act like a little kid  but I don't want kids|`|6otOx9m1aa	Sure    but just not at 14

4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	It means you were born sometime between June 21 and July 20, and that the constellation Scorpio was on the horizon at the time of your birth. Astrologists say that your Sun sign is the "engine" of your personality  while your Rising Sign is how you are seen by others - your "chassis" as it were. Cancers tend to be cautious, careful; security seeking, nurturing, quirky, funny and unpredictable. Scorpio Rising means that you are probably a lot more assertive than the typical Cancer; reserved or even secretive; tend to "not get mad, but get even." Probably very intuitive given the heavy influence of water signs. Find out what your Moon is in - this will determine your moods, emotions.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	i am the exact opposite scorpio sun cancer rising  rising is how people see you sort of and sun is who you really are... sort of|`|I0aeO3FAaa	the rising sign is your moon sign i think or it could be the sun    if you want to know more you can go to borders and geta book all about it or you can google it and get your chart for free

That's cute(:   I'm doing something like that, too, except that it's just a teddy bear and some candy and my crush doesn't exactly know that I like him... But maybe that will give him a clue(:  Anyways, good luck.|`|GfG4PfjMaa	A lot of people may think it's cute, but I think it's a prelude to a life of continous bad behavior.    I believe in a liberated woman, when it comes to job, opportunities and advancement.    When it comes to romance, I want a man who thinks enough of me to send me something first.    Why did you do that?  Don't you know a boy is supposed to pursue the girl?  He is supposed to send you the candy gram.    When a female makes the first move toward a man, she will never really know if he likes her for the purpose of liking her, or if he likes her because she gives good gifts.    You hurt yourself when you don't wait to see if someone likes you well enough to make a move toward you.  At this point he will counter move and the motivation may not be because he likes you, but because he don't want to be out done or he don't want to seem like he has no class.    You knew the move was wrong, the fact that you post this question says you were unsure.(here's a rule....when in doubt....DON'T)     Let this be a permanent lesson to you.    Never, ever, ever as a female make a move on any guy you like.    You will never get respect from him and you will be forever guessing if he is really interested in you OR THE THINGS YOU GIVE HIM.    Don't be surprised if he takes your candy gram and give it to another.    And the fact that everyone does it, never is a good excuse.....If everyone put crap on their faces you gonna do it to.  Stupid is as stupid does.    If you are the kind of girl that wants diamond rings and a whole lot of good things, then you have to be the kind that is patient to see what life brings.  If you upset the natural plan, you will find yourself with an unappreciative man, who will be always giving what you give to another because you were so desperate for a lover.    Learn to wait, don't give up nothing until you know he is into you and is for real.      There is the story of the hunter who opens his door and finds a kill already at his door, do you think he considers it a trophy or he has more of an emotional involvement from the kill that he has stalked and preyed?  Think about it.      Don't become the kill that is left at the door, you are going to get tossed as garbage....but if he pursues you,if he gets emotionally involved with you,  then you become a prize to be mounted and oh the story he will tell about how you were captured.  You become a prize.      At 8th grade this lesson will be one that will take you through life.    So many grown up women don't know this...they still out buying for the man, cooking for him, doing for him,  trying to give him what they want to receive and it never works out.....not until you have learned to wait and receive "FIRST", THEN by all means. say thank you.....and don't be in a hurry to recriprocate.     Never ever, ever give up s e x, the moment you do, you lose!  Wait, give yourself two weeks, if your emotions are running high.  Never day dream about boys, s e x  or love, for it adds fuel to a burning fire that you started and now wait for them to put out.  Day dream about what you really want in life, always control your thinking.      Right now it shouldn't be important that you like him, because he is in no position to do anything for you.  You should learn to like YOU a little better and stop treating yourself like you desperate.    I know your hormones are racing and peer pressure is a pain.  But you listen to Ms. D......  Ride the storm, and learn to control your emotions before you wind up giving away your whole store for just the price of a few feels and kisses.       Make yourself worthy of more....Don't settle, and keep your legs closed tight.  It gets easier with time and with practice.    And don't open them til you get all the good things life has to offer.  Don't sell yourself cheap.....  Giving cards now, what will you give later???  Think, Think  Think.    Truth is if it comes too easy then it must not be worth much.    I know you think I may be hard right now, but believe me when I say at the end of this your happiness is of concern.    The following book is a must read for you and all your girls, and read it over and over again until you get it into your spirits.    Why Men Love B--itches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl-A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship: Sherry Argov    See if they have it at your public library or if you have the money, buy it.    It will help you understand the male behavior so you don't go through live making stupid mistakes by laying your cards on the table even before the game begins.|`|ourCk6Piaa	ya. just dont put "i love you". that would freak any guy out|`|Tu2cSBAqaa	aw thts cute! |`|4whkdnxKaa	yeah, totally|`|AA10236979	How will he know who it's from since you didn't write your name?

DnyyyGeEaa	I totally agree I really liked the one with the Mowry's. The only reason this one with Zac Efron is coming out is because of who he is and they think they will make more money on it because all of the younger girls would want to see it.|`|YAM1LFsgaa	it's probably because zac efron is a lot bigger of a name than the mowry sibilings  if you are thinking it is race I highly highly doubt it  more girls would probably go for something zac efron is in you know?  better marketing    I loved the movie though|`|74G6xqk4aa	because zac is amazing and tia and tamara are little disney stars who couldn't make it big|`|bKCHoz4caa	Its just because a production company wanted to have the movie, maybe the director. And yea, that was a really good movie.    Katie|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	Because apparently people think Zac Efron is larger than life and will make them tons of money.    It's all about the money and the pretty people...although Tia and Tahj are pretty, they just weren't global stars.|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	Zac's a major deal and it was picked up by a major motion picture.  The movie is probably longer also. Tia and Tamara's was 2 hours with commericals.

I can love you like that.  16. Not ready for goodbye.  17. Oh girl.  18. So much in love.  19. Someday (from the movie "The hunchback of Notredame").  20. Someone who lives in your heart.  21.

The woman behind the counter looks them over and asks, "Do you girls want to see something?"    Confused they say yes.    The woman pulls out a ceramic pot from behind the counter, and says, "If you stick your head in this pot and say something you think is true, but it is not true you will disapear off the face of the Earth, POOF! But if what you say is true, the pot will turn to gold and it is yours to keep."    The redhead sticks her head in the pot and wispers, "I think I am the smartest girl in the world." And POOF! she disapears.    The brunette sticks her head in the pot and says, "I think I am the most beautiful girl in the world." And POOF! she disapears.    Then the blond sticks her head in the pot and says, "I think..." And POOF! she disapears.|`|wpqJr2FMaa	Ha, that was funny!  How about this?  A man walks into a bank, and tells the banker   "By tomorrow afternoon, your penis will turn green, I'll bet you $25,000"  The banker says, "Sure, your loss."  So the next day the banker walks in with his lawyer, and says "My penis hasn't turned green yet, you owe me $25,000."  So the man says "O.K, sure, but I want to check just to make sure."  The banker says, "O.K."  Then the banker unzips his fly, and flashes his penis to the man.  Suddenly the lawyer faints.  The banker asks "Hey, why did my lawyer faint?"  And the man says:  "I just bet your lawyer $50,000 that you would drop your pants in the afternoon."

He doesnt seem to be breathing, his eyes are rolled back in his head.    The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps to the operator: My friend is dead! What can I do?    The operator, in a calm, soothing voice, says: Just take it easy. I can help. First, lets make sure hes dead.    There is a silence, then a shot is heard. The guys voice comes back on the line. He says: Okay, now what?        2nd joke:      Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson goes on a camping trip. After a good dinner and a bottle of wine, they retire for the night, and go to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes up and nudges his faithful friend.    Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.    I see millions and millions of stars, Holmes, replies Watson.    And what do you deduce from that?    Watson ponders for a minute.    Well, astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three.    Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are a small and insignificant part of the universe. What does it tell you, Holmes?    Holmes is silent for a moment. Watson, you idiot! he says. Someone has stolen our tent!        3rd joke:        A man and a friend are playing golf one day at their local golf course. One of the guys is about to chip onto the green when he sees a long funeral procession on the road next to the course. He stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, closes his eyes, and bows down in prayer. His friend says: Wow, that is the most thoughtful and touching thing I have ever seen. You truly are a kind man. The man then replies: Yeah, well we were married 35 years.|`|Id2CspZfaa	A man asked to another man, "Is the water clean?" The other replied, "Why?

He knew which room she was in at the hotel and called her up wondering  what happened to her. She answered the phone, sobbing, and said she couldn't get out of her room.    "You can't get out of your room?" the captaind asked, "Why not?"

One brother was very mischievous, always getting into trouble. The other brother, however, was very good. He was always kind to animals, helped elderly neighbors, and led an exemplary life.    As time went on, the brothers stayed in touch but were never close. The Evil brother became a heavy drinker and a womanizer. The other brother was a devoted husband and father and supported many charities.    One day the evil brother died. Then, after a few years, the good brother Passed away. He went to heaven and was rewarded with a happy afterlife.    One day he went to God and asked, Where is my brother? He died before me, but I have not seen him here in heaven.    God replied, As you know, your brother led an evil life, so he is not Spending eternity here in heaven. He has been sent elsewhere.    I m sorry to hear that , the good brother replied. But I do miss him and Wish I could see him again.    You can see him if you wish , God said I will give you the power to gaze Into hell.    So the power was granted and the good brother gazed into hell. Before long He saw his brother sitting on a bench. In one arm he held a keg of beer, and In the other he cradled a gorgeous young blonde.    The good brother turned to God and said, I can t believe what I m seeing. I have found my brother, and he has a keg of beer in one arm and a beautiful woman in the other. Surely, hell can not be that bad.    God explained. Things are not always as they seem, my son. The keg has a Hole in it. The blonde doesn t      A man left for work one Friday afternoon. But it was payday, so instead of going home, he stayed out the entire weekend partying with the boys and spending his entire paycheck.    When he finally appeared at home on Sunday night, he was confronted by his angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade befitting his actions. Finally his wife stopped the nagging and said to him, How would you like it if you didn t see me for two or three days? He replied, That would be fine with me.    Monday went by and he didn t see his wife. Tuesday and Wednesday came and went with the same results. But on Thursday, the swelling went down just enough where he could see her a little out of the corner of his left eye.    A man with a gun went into a bank and demanded their money. Once he was given the money, he turned to a customer and asked, Did you see me rob this bank?    The man replied, Yes sir, I did.    The robber then shot him in the temple, killing him instantly.    He then turned to a couple standing next to him and asked the man, Did you see me rob this bank?    The man replied, No sir, I didn t, but my wife did      Traveling down the interstate and needing to use the restroom,  I stop at a rest area and head to the restroom.    I was barely sitting down when I heard a voice from the other stall saying:  Hi, how are you?    I m not the type to start a conversation in the restroom and I don t know what got into me, but I answered, somewhat embarrassed,  Doin just fine!    And the other person says:  So what are you up to?    What kind of question is that? At that point, I m thinking this is too bizarre so I say:  Uhhh, I m like you, just traveling!    At this point I am just trying to get out as fast as I can when I hear another question.  Can I come over?    Ok, this question is just too weird for me but I figured I could just be polite and end the conversation. I tell them  No..I m a little busy right now!!!    Then I hear the person say nervously...

The man says, "I'll have a beer" and turns to the ostrich. "What's yours?" "I'll have a beer too" says the ostrich.        The bartender pours the beer and says "That will be $3.40 please," and the man reaches into his pocket and pays bartender with the exact change for payment.        The next day, the man and the ostrich come again, and the man says "I'll have a beer," and the ostrich says "I'll have the same."        Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This became a routine until late one evening, the two enter again.        "The usual?" asks the bartender."Well, it's close to last call, so I'll have a large Scotch" says the man. "Same for me" says the ostrich.        "That will be $7.20" says the bartender. Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the bar. The bartender can't hold back his curiosity any longer.        "Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?" "Well," says the man, "several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found this old lamp.        When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever needed to pay for anything, I just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money will be there."        "That's brilliant!" says the bartender. "Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!"        "That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk, or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there," says the man. "That's fantastic!" says the bartender.        "You are a genius! ... Oh, one other thing sir, what's with the ostrich?" The man replies,        "Oh, my second wish was for a chick with long legs."|`|Ly0VVzU2aa	this joke isnt very funny..|`|I0aeO3FAaa	hahahaha this is so funny! im going to tell it to all my friends!!!!!!|`|GqTSa85daa	Funny...

Then within 5 minutes the blonde dies. The dentist then listens to the audio and the audio says:  Breath in, breath out, breath in, breath out....

They see a cruise ship located about one mile away and decide to swim out to it since it is the only place to get food,water, and shelter. The brunette swims half the way then drowns.

They went on a camping trip to look for different animal tracks. They split up and said they would meet in 1 hour.     When they met again they told each other what they found.    The red head found kangaroo tracks and bear tracks.    The brunette found Giraffe tracks and deer tracks.    When they finished talking they noticed the blonde wasn't there.   10:00pm that night they saw on the news that there  had been a blonde girl that got ran over by a train. The train driver claims that the girl was standing in the middle of the tracks ex-aiming the tracks.

After a trip to the bathroom, he made his way downstairs, where his wife put some coffee in front of him.    'Louise,' he moaned, 'tell me what happened last night. Was it as bad as I think?'    'Even worse,' she said, her voice oozing scorn. 'You made a complete *** of yourself. You succeeded in antagonizing the entire board of directors, and you insulted the president of the company, right to his face.'    'He's an idiot,' John said. 'Piss on him.'    'You did', came the reply. 'And he fired you.'    'Well, screw him!' said John.    'I did. You're back to work on Monday.'

You get one wish, but only if you tell the truth, or you go to hell. So the brunette walks in and says, "I think I am the richest girl, in the world" *poof* she disappears, so the red head tries, she says, "I think Im the prettiest girl in the world" *poof* she disappears, so the blonde goes up and says "I think...." *poof* she disappears.|`|35dec4feee4eb0e44ba34d58e1fd64a4aa	I love it!! here's one       A man is standing at the pearly gates and St. Peter addresses him: All you need to have done is one good deed, and we will allow you passage into heaven    The man says, No problem, as he recounts to St. Peter that he once stopped at an intersection and saw a motorcycle gang harassing a young woman. He got out of his car, walked up to one of the bikerswho was over seven feet tall and must have weighed nearly 400 poundsand told the biker that abusing and harassing a woman is a cowardly act and that he would not tolerate it in his presence. He then reached up, yanked out his nose ring and kicked him in the balls to make a point.    St. Peter is frantically searching the mans life in his book in front of him and says, I cant find that incident anywhere in your filewhen did that happen?    The man looks down at his watch and says, Oh, about five minutes ago.|`|zXo63ttYaa	haha so funny! :D NOT|`|4ahQSLxSaa	YES|`|I5SypMlsaa	lol  A teacher asks a student:  -why werent you at school the day before yesterday?  -my mom was washing my pants and i didnt have any other ones...  -ok, but why were you away yesterday?  -yesterday i was passing your house, i look and i see your hanging. i thought you wouldnt come either|`|R0NezNg8aa	lol I had a good laugh from that one!       here is one: A blonde had just went on a shopping spree and did not have any money on her credit card so she came up with a plan. She kidnapped a little kid and wrote a note. The note said "If you want your kid back bring me 50000 dollars and leave it by the park tree. - from blonde girl" When she was done writing the note she told the little kid "go home to your mommy and give her this note." The next day the blonde goes to the park tree and sees the bag of money and a note from the woman. The note says "Here is your money, I imediatly got the money when my child gave me this note! - from a fellow blonde"|`|4ut7wJQsaa	Okay so there's this bar at the top of a mountain, near a cliff. A man walks into it, and sees a drunk man. He decides to go talk to him, because what kind of drunk guy isn't interesting?    So he walks over to the drunk guy, and the drunk man says "I bet you $50 I can jump off this cliff and live."    The man considers this, and decides to take the bet.    The drunk man jumps off the cliff, and the wind pushes him back to the point that he jumped off from. The sober man then pays $50 and asks how this was possible.    The drunk man says to him "all you have to do is jump off and spread out your arms" so the sober man jumps off the cliff, and spreads out his arms, and falls to his death    The Bartender, seeing this whole affair says "Thanks a lot, superman, you just lost another customer!"|`|ZDjBMsVUaa	blond jokes are the best!   A Blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom.   She went to the playground, grabbed a kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, "I've kidnapped you."   She then wrote a note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north side of the playground. Signed, A Blonde."   The Blonde then pinned the note to the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.   The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting beneath the pecan tree.   The Blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with a note that said, "How could you do this to a fellow Blonde?"    heres another if this isnt funny enough for u ^_^    One day, while a blonde was out driving her car, she ran into a truck. The truck's driver made her pull over into a parking lot and get out of the car. He took a piece of chalk and drew a circle on the pavement. He told her to stand in the middle and not leave the circle. Furious, he went over to her car and slashed the tires. The blonde started laughing. This made the man angrier so he smashed her windshield. This time the blonde laughed even harder. Livid, the man broke all her windows and keyed her car. The blonde is now laughing hysterically, so the truck driver asks her what's so funny. The blonde giggles and replies, "When you weren't looking, I stepped out of the circle three times!"    another......lol.......        A blonde goes into a Best Buy. She asks a clerk if she can buy the TV in the corner. The clerk looks at her and says that he doesn't serve blondes, so she goes back home and dyes her hair black.        The next day she returns to the store and asks the same thing and again the clerk said he doesn't serve blondes.        Frustrated, the blonde goes home and dyes her hair yet again, to a shade of red. Sure that a clerk would sell her the TV this time, she returns and asks a different clerk this time. To her astonishment, this clerk also says that she doesn't serve blondes. The blonde asks the clerk, "How do you know I am a blonde?"       The clerk looks at her disgustedly and says,"That's not a TV - it's a microwave."    so funny!  XD|`|U1i6qLsIaa	its kinda lame...no offense...but other ppl really posted some good jokes in here..|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	1. some kids are in the dinner queue at a catholic school.  on a tray of apples one of the nuns had written "take only one, God is watching".    at the front end of the queue there is a large tray of chocolate chip cookies.  a kid had written "take all you want, God is watching the apples"    2. adam blamed eve, eve blamed the snake and the snake didnt have a leg to stand on.    3.  so this guy dies and goes to heaven.  he is being shown to his room by st peter.  the guy is very happy cos he has everything he needs for all eternity.  on the first night he goes to sleep but is woken after a few hours by rather loud music coming from the next room.      the next day, the man has a word with st peter, and tells him that jimi hendrix had woken him up in the night playing his guitar.  st peter said that it was nonsense, jimi hendrix isnt in the next room.    the next night, the same thing happens again.  rather annoyed the man speak with st peter.  again he is tolold that jimi hendrix is not in the next room.    a week passes by, same story each night.  the guy is becoming really angry.  st peter is also getting a little flustered with the same question everyday.  he decides to tell the man the truth. he says "the thing is, its God.  he thinks he is jimi hendrix".|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	It's not the funniest EVER.

If shot with an IMAX camera the movie is in really excellent Hi-Definition.  The other really nice thing about it is, when I was watching Dark Knight this summer, the Panoramic views felt like you were actually in the movie.  It's quite an experience.|`|WMNbGsoWaa	I've seen both Iron Man and Transformers in IMAX theater. It's just a really, really HUGE screen.

The sun is out, I was clean and dressed...and I went to work.  I didn't ditch it all to be a writer, or a rock star, or a movie star.  I didn't move to Africa, South America, or Asia to help build houses with Habitat For Humanity.

Its really small. Lol.  I mean what is everyone's problem with Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus?  I mean I am 20 years old and am in no way an obsessed fan of theirs.  I just don't see the big deal.   Every generation has a band/group that people get overly-obsessed over.  I mean even the old people can understand that.   There were the Beatles, Elvis, in my generation it was NSYNC and Backstreet Boys.   I just don't see what the difference is.

Or would you just get their autograph to sell it?|`|S7L1o8HIaa	I would scare the crap out of them so they would run out of the closet and hear their girly screams. And then I would ask them why they are so gay. LOL!
S4W7FojCaa	Yes they make me sick. I'm 18 and I try to refrain from those types of movies. Sex scenes disgust me unless it's between two lovers in a romance movie.     Along with those sex movies, there are drugs and all that stuff. Take the movie Thirteen for example. When I watched it I was 15 and I thought that the things they were doing in the movie were cool and they dressed cool. Luckily for me, I was too shy to do those things. Thank God I didn't and am still a virgin. My sister watches these movies all the time and she is sixteen and she goes out and has sex with her boyfriend, who has girls before her on his myspace friends list. She's ruined her life. She doesn't know or understand that yet, but she will when she gets older and she will regret not saving herself for Mr. Right.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	I agree! I am so sick of these movies. How do they keep making money?|`|gbm71puSaa	Hollywood wouldn't know an Original if it hit them in the face. So they stick with these cookie cutter generic ideas that they seem to see as money makers. I wish they would calm down on that stuff too, and I'm a guy. I wish T.V. would back off from it alot more. The American pie movies really started it ( I did like the first one, the rest were crap) and everyone else fallowed on thier heels.

Here's a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_m-Bjrxm...    And the Lyrics:  Hey there Delilah  What's it like in New York City?  I'm a thousand miles away  But girl, tonight you look so pretty  Yes you do  Times Square can't shine as bright as you  I swear it's true    Hey there Delilah  Don't you worry about the distance  I'm right there if you get lonely  Give this song another listen  Close your eyes  Listen to my voice, it's my disguise  I'm by your side    Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  What you do to me    Hey there Delilah  I know times are getting hard  But just believe me, girl  Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar  We'll have it good  We'll have the life we knew we would  My word is good    Hey there Delilah  I've got so much left to say  If every simple song I wrote to you  Would take your breath away  I'd write it all  Even more in love with me you'd fall  We'd have it all    Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me    A thousand miles seems pretty far  But they've got planes and trains and cars  I'd walk to you if I had no other way  Our friends would all make fun of us  and we'll just laugh along because we know  That none of them have felt this way  Delilah I can promise you  That by the time we get through  The world will never ever be the same  And you're to blame    Hey there Delilah  You be good and don't you miss me  Two more years and you'll be done with school   And I'll be making history like I do  You'll know it's all because of you  We can do whatever we want to  Hey there Delilah here's to you  This one's for you    Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  Oh it's what you do to me  What you do to me.|`|6m8MOx3taa	maybe you could try josh pyke, or damien rice (imparticular "The Blower's Daughter", "cannonball") or even "Falling slowly" by Glen Hansard.

HZxX9ke8aa	say this scorpio is a man; he will be sneaky and intense toward his opponents (maybe he and some other guy likes same girl) yet he will be obvious hysterically if he is suspicious of his girl friend i guess.|`|icZARsMtaa	LOL I loved the, "probably murder," answer.     Anyway, I don't make it obvious, under any circumstances. It's sneaky and intense. Usually, I'll investigate the person I feel threatened by, on my own time. Because I don't ask anyone questions, the first place I go is MySpace. They've never not had one, it's quite amusing.     If I'm dating someone that mentions the person, I'll probably ask in another question, making it appear like it's for the conversation, but really for my own curiosity. I like to know my competition.    One time, though, my ex cheated on me, (before he was obviously my ex) and I planned on going through great lengths to destroy everything in that girl's life. It was very malicious, and just under murder, quite honestly. But that wasn't jealousy, as much as a combination of hurt and anger.    But this is just me, a female Scorpio. My male Scorpio ex would make it completely obvious. He confronted me one time, because I was spending too much time with my best friend... whom was a male, at the time. Then he'd slip in other concerns that bothered him, from months ago. It was weird. It was like he'd pick one event as an excuse to pour his insecurities out.|`|uHbzyCcHaa	BEIN A SCORP....I REALLY AM NOT JEALOUS....BUT SOMETIMES I DO...WE JUST BE SO QUIET AND JUST THINK TO OURSELVES ABOUT WHY WERE JEALOUS........AND THEN WE FORGET ABOUT IT...CUZ ITS A WASE OF OUR TIME......SO YEAH.....BUT IN RELATIONSHIPS WE MAKE IT SO DAYUM OBVIOUS!!!!!!

0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	I've never lied about my weight, whoever is gonna be my friend or love me has to love me and my chunky azz or get lost. I'm so much more then just my wight.    Women lie because MOST men have expectations on their womens body image and criticize what they don't like, without taking the womans feelings into consideration.    Why do MOST men lie about their "size"? .......... LOL... it goes both ways...haha!!    Cheers you... where have ju been, stranger =)|`|U8aXa8xEaa	I don't understand that either.  It's not like people can't see your body size.  I can see it with lying about your age.  Sometimes people can look younger than they are.   But not weight.|`|vOPlkCRAaa	cus of embarrasment|`|0mhcCyE5aa	I do not lie,    I am fat and I know it, therefore I never tell people how much I weigh.    The reason they lie is because men tend to like super skinny girls and very few of us are like that!!!|`|yAXrsQiFaa	Because guys are such a pain in the azz about it.|`|LJf5rklZaa	for some reason those ignorant skinny models put it into every gals head that they must be a toothpick leading them to lie to men about how much they weigh.  my wife wont even step on the scale in front of me  and she is perfect.  WOMEN!|`|YRRzZJR6aa	Because if you are slightly heavier than the average woman, its embarrasing and people would assume you to be fat.|`|NXrYtxFmaa	i dont know because i'd still hit it.|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	no matter how skinny a woman is, she'll think she's fat.  xx|`|RtJ11zUZaa	Because socitey has a specific idea of what a woman should look like whether it's realistic or not.|`|0eab0b6e32b135981c458e469f63de2eaa	they are self conscious of their weight|`|d332c8dfedce3f0a7503c8a7ba3e0b9baa	same reason  guys lie about there size of penis|`|42semosXaa	Exactly what Regular Guy said,|`|8BJQbTRqaa	it makes us feel better....except for me, i have to lie and go UP cause bitchesss hate on my skinny @$$|`|AA10910187	cus it can be embarrassing|`|LUT28UgTaa	I never lie about my weight I just never tell anybody....I'm a big beautiful woman and I know it and who ever doesn't like it well too bad. But I'd say most woman lie about their weight because of society, every time you turn the t.v  they're talking about what the perfect weight should be and if you're five pounds heavier you're considered obese. It's crazy.    Se te extra?a....cuidate! =)

9KWVgb9naa	oh sherrie and thats my final answer|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Don't Stop Believin'!!!      "Hold On to that Feeling!"|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Don't stop believin'. (: Great song right thurrr.|`|SCY8zRaLaa	It could be one of two songs:  1. Journey -  Don't Stop Believing     or  2.Phil Collins -  I Can Feel It In the Air Tonight|`|wMGglNRxaa	no doubt its dont stop beleiveing -journey|`|oPxaBxV7aa	Well it is one of two do you remember these words?    Don't stop believen  Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world  She took the midnight train goin' anywhere  Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit  He took the midnight train goin' anywhere      A singer in a smokey room  A smell of wine and cheap perfume  For a smile they can share the night  It goes on and on and on and on    (Chorus)  Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard  Their shadows searching in the night  Streetlight people, living just to find emotion  Hiding, somewhere in the night      Working hard to get my fill,  everybody wants a thrill  Payin' anything to roll the dice,  just one more time  Some will win, some will lose  Some were born to sing the blues  Oh, the movie never ends  It goes on and on and on and on      (Chorus)      Don't stop believin'  Hold on to the feelin'  Streetlights people    Don't stop believin'  Hold on  Streetlight people    Don't stop believin'  Hold on to the feelin'  Streetlights people      Or.....?    Oh Sherry  You should've been gone  Knowing how I made you feel  And I should've been gone  After all your words of steel  Oh I must've been a dreamer  And I must've been someone else  And we should've been over    Oh Sherry, our love  Holds on, holds on  Oh Sherry, our love  Holds on, holds on    But I want to let go  You'll go on hurtin' me  You'd be better off alone  If I'm not who you thought I'd be    But you know that there's a fever  Oh that you'll never find nowhere else  Can't you feel it burnin' on and on    (chorus)    But I should've been gone  Long ago, far away  And you should've been gone  Now I know just why you stay    (chorus)    Oh Sherry, our love  Holds on, holds on

It shows off their natural grace. on others it just doesn't look good good for a variety of reasons.|`|bnPufBlAaa	I am not a guy but I will give an answer, Heels give ladies longer thinner looking legs, men love legs....if they follow two long shapely sexy legs from the heels up their eyes will end at one of their two other fav. spots, depending on which way the lady is faced...Anyways Think about it are muddy sneakers sexy or a shoe that enhances the curves ....|`|Av9jeRAkaa	i think that not every guy likes it...but i dont know why they find it attractive LOL|`|1PGmB4JNaa	ima girl buttttttwanna here guys opinions and get two pts|`|elECfJ52aa	I don't|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	It is very sexy.|`|feUMAvgLaa	Its sexy|`|TGV834WJaa	im not a guy, but i guess its cause it makes a girls legs look longer, and its sexier than just barefoot or flat on the ground...but i like wearing heels cause im only 5'2 and they make me normal(ish) height! haha|`|1FTFCtaNaa	I don't know, it just looks hott|`|bBHlGs5waa	It's sexy.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Reid C summed it up perfect|`|WVUuqf3Baa	It shows off the legs and Butt and makes girls stand straight up.    Its sexier|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	as long as it looks good then sure|`|nMzzwrtUaa	I like it but then they also make allot of noise when they walk, girls who don't know how to walk in them well stumble all over the place and you become there little crutch. honestly i want some thing that you can actually walk in.|`|jgedIY8taa	Okay, I'll be explicit.  When women wear high heels, it gives an arch to their back and posture.  It is the same arched-in-passion look we imagine in her back when she is on top during intercourse.    And that's why women in heels look hot.  Or else they look like they're just about ready to fall over...it's sometimes a fine line between eroticism or slap-stick comedy.|`|KTtLYrcZaa	yea... i think it's so sexy...|`|X6R9XrR1aa	it makes them look hot|`|o4L80PvBaa	no i dont it's grows|`|bGkQSS68aa	it looks nice|`|fWclxi9Baa	cause it makes them look more attractive|`|wMXsyQRwaa	hey!!! that's cheating!|`|F5Tf0Wowaa	i just do|`|pKnpnlcIaa	It even makes girls with chunky legs look somewhat thin|`|NXrYtxFmaa	because i've seen one to many porno's.|`|4ahQSLxSaa	i dont care what type of shoes girls have on :| so cant answer unless this is an answer ?|`|4wvm4RBxaa	Not me, I'd rather see her bare foot.

Don't know how old you are but imagine if your parents / teachers had one -  would it be cool or ???? would you still want one?   would you want to show it to someone you want to respect you? take you seriously?    Can you cover it up without looking as if you've joined some cult or other?    Can you show it without being accused of indecent exposure?|`|KOsGtal8aa	hiding in the dark would take a bit more effort|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Better yet what is the point of them?|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Makes it harder to hide from the police at night!|`|UCppfL6raa	You couldn't play night tag or hide and seek in the dark.|`|GqDaGHUBaa	Not allowed in movie theaters...|`|ourCk6Piaa	umm. i cant think of anything. i think they would look freakin amazing!!

I ususally don't say bless you haha  But when people say it to me, I atleast say thanks!|`|YfCRmWeSaa	a little, but it doesn't matter|`|GtPerJQraa	i dont get really mad.. but i usually think in my head 'how rude!'|`|5jINw4PGaa	I wouldn't get that upset.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	I don't - afterall i just blessed the person!|`|AEAS7A9naa	no. I say 'bless you' automatically but that doesn't mean you have to say thanks or anything.|`|OPsvTjcXaa	sometimes|`|S3tK5UN3aa	Um no not really.  I don't say bless you though.  Which is probably a bad thing.|`|Qqh2juUsaa	no =P|`|NHG8JPIAaa	That sounds like me when I sneeze.  I don't say thank you after some one says bless you.    Why do you even say bless you?|`|nXUV9lH1aa	LOL YEAH.|`|xNYUZZvlaa	Well, not really. It's just some people don't think it's actually necessary to say thank you.    (Sneezes)    You say, "Bless you."    Thank You(:    Is that better?(: Don't get upset for little things, not trying to be rude, I promise.|`|WyjRm10jaa	OK.. i'm sorry.. to her..    i get the idea..|`|xESvfzQAaa	Yes, it's quite annoying when they don't even acknowledge your good will.    Kinda like a person not waving after you let them merge in front of you on the freeway.  Bastards deserve a slow cancerous death.|`|A15bfvkBaa	I'll get over it.  I don't really say bless you haha.. just when i notice they sneezed.|`|0c9e1b3ae869853565acf7c72f5fb7a9aa	sometime cuz your kinda expecting it after  they sneeze|`|BFNQB7vGaa	dont know|`|212FfV3faa	yes,somehow|`|YGhtWspiaa	Yah how rude! Saying thanks is like saying sorry for my nasty boogers for getting all over the place.|`|RtJ11zUZaa	No, that's just people.|`|clqgFUFFaa	Yes, its hurt|`|AA10227117	yeah.  like i actually said something, the other better say Thank you  lol|`|Tu2cSBAqaa	i could care less|`|wUaMEwSsaa	not upset...   just be like  WOW UR WELCOME|`|zNFqe8Iiaa	a145b110- YOUR THE GAY ONE!

Perhaps the girl was unwell.  Don't let it upset you.  Don't spoil the lovely experience you had when you said, 'Bless you'.  Not too many people do what you did.  You shall have a star for your kindness.|`|yyIVrngcaa	yea, its quite annoying when ppl are rude...    I always say bless you to people, yet when I sneeze no one says bless you to me =/ sucks, people and manners...    Some of em weren't raised as good as the rest of us i guess. Relax though, not their fault they don't know better. They can't read minds either :)|`|P1LkXSBLaa	its so annoying when people dont say thank you i mean espically if  you have enough manners to say bless you they should atleast say thank you!|`|uIokvXK5aa	omg i agree that ttly pisses me off|`|3c0J1meGaa	i think its rude|`|TdiuwtM5aa	sometimes because its not like ur saying anything wrong all your doing is saying god bless you maybe they don't believe in god they may have a diff. religion|`|LYPUG1KLaa	yes|`|lA5WkPuYaa	I would probably be a little upset... but I would just let it go. Some people just never learn their manners.|`|PzmLYUe6aa	no|`|klhB1ijwaa	no but someone did get mad when i didn't say bless u after they sneezed.|`|AA11818174	yeah. I mean that's rude.|`|taMKteLVaa	No, i say 'bless you' everytime after someone sneezes but i don't say it if they sneeze three times. I'll probably just say it once.  but if i were the girl that sneezed 3 times and you said it after everytime, i probably wouldn't say thanks either.|`|bgdjtJepaa	wouldn't upset me.  i usually forget to say bless you to begin with.  it's generally just an expected empty gesture.|`|V835xv3kaa	I would notice but I wouldnt hold a grudge or something. But saying thank you is important!|`|QiZ6ib7Uaa	u have issues|`|s6hhRtQuaa	*Sneezes*    Sorry, whaddya say?|`|EOaFZoNtaa	people do not know there manners anymore. it slightly makes me mad. but i get over things quickly so i said meh. okay.|`|AA11758263	Yes, I think I would feel upset too.|`|AA11624857	no, but it bothers me a bit. and then i get over it.|`|AA11558287	No I don't get upset because at least I was nice enough to tell the person bless you..it's not my fault if they have lack of manners|`|uIWSJYa7aa	i get so pissed,  i ain't gonna take it for too long dough  i am gonna ***** slap that little ***** who ain't say thank ya|`|6ZNLbNsGaa	Yea kinda makes me feel invisible:(|`|loY9z5rvaa	no  not everyone says ty|`|VpG8q7yuaa	No... But it is somewhat annoying.|`|lmtFK320aa	hahahaha yeah! i thought i was the only one... it really bothers me! it's one of my top pet peeves. nooo joke|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	hellll no, life is too short to let stuff like that bother me!|`|oq29JFRfaa	its kind of weird when they don't say thankyou|`|7eEFKDrOaa	Never because I know inside that I'm already blessed.......Kat|`|hMZQd7Cpaa	hahaa yoo' bitc* loll ; thats funny. Uhmm kinda like say thnx atlieast yu coldhearted sycho bitc*.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	do you know why people say bless you?? its because your heart skips a beat at every sneeze. a very long time ago people would literally try to bless you to make sure you wouldnt... die.   i cant have ANYONE sneeze without me saying bless you - even if i dont know them, and even if they cant hear me.. is that OCD? lol!!!     *ACHOO!!!*     bless me! =P|`|yRZuoyPXaa	No.  As long as their germs stay with the sneezer.|`|SbKkgwPQaa	no|`|wdnbwViFaa	not really. it's not a big deal|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	no|`|l1pewZpaaa	No.Sometimes I forget to say thank you|`|XDfrSfrvaa	no, cause im not GOD|`|4WCLWhaTaa	I just follow them home and then kill them in their sleep. Completely justifiable right?|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No. I don't even bother to say it anymore because if I say...God Bless you..people get pissed where we live because its not Politically Correct since there is such a massive acceptance of all ranges of religion.

OR;;    'I want to break free', 'Killer Queen', or 'Under Pressure', All of which are by Queen, except the last one, which is done by Queen and Bowie.      Queen was an amazing band and in my opinion, no other band will be able to touch them. EVER. Freddie had such an amazing voice, I would've loved to have been able to see them live, in all of their glory. But unfortunately, considering Freddie died in 1992, when I was about 4, I'll never receive that chance.    And, I threw My Chemical Romance in because; All of their songs just speak to me, it's impossible to explain.

hceNM6Uxaa	It's something about how it connects to my own experience, offers me a mirror for feelings that I may not have words to describe.  If I'm listening to Arvo Part's "Cantus in memory of Benjamin Britten", I get to that final tintabulation (bell-like sound) that becomes intensely clear as everything else dies away, and feel reconnected to my absolute centre, to a sort of quiet, still, ecstasy of existence.  If I listen to Beethoven's 7th, I'm moved to my core by every emotion in the human compendium, a sense of urgency, of connection.  Shostakovich's 8th goes for terror and awe and triumph of the spirit.  When I first heard it, in my mid-teens, it was a revelation that someone else knew these feelings and I stopped experiencing myself as so completely alienated from the human race, as I stood on the dining room table and conducted it at full volume and never ceased to be utterly delighted that the percussion came in at the right moment.......  Grateful Dead music was very bound up with some brilliant drug experiences in my late teens and early 20s and although I've not done those drugs for over 30 years, listening to some of those songs rekindles that sense of possibility.  United States of America and that extraordinary voice of Dorothy Moskowitz made it possible to be crazy and OK all at once.  Schubert's String Quintet in C means that pain at the greatest depth is real, and survivable, just.    Oh, I could go on and on but it's late and the bath is waiting.  Hope this gives an adequate flavour of what I mean.|`|wBzv5awkaa	it drowns me in euphoric energy and I lucking fove it|`|hvNqywbBaa	I'll answer why I really don't listen to music much.    I guess I blame this on my dad. Growing up he had a stereo on in the kitchen, the living room, the garage and even piped it outside.    But the biggest problem , as a kid, was that he had this blaring jazz on at 7:30 AM  on a Saturday morning.  Gee, I would've liked to sleep in til 8am.|`|WwbAKBWraa	It triggers the pleasure centers in my brain...is that good enough?|`|QpGdfh40aa	it calms me down when i'm mad|`|Gehy97eBaa	Hm...I listen to the music I do because it puts me in a trance. I day dream often so the music I listen to provides the soundtrack to my day dreams. Also if it connects with memories, or it's what I listened to growing up and having good memories with the ones I Love. Also if it relates to mood I'll listen to it alot...like when I'm angry or pissed. i blast metal. if i'm happy or joyful i blast stuff like the beatles or buddy holly or techno.etc etc....i could go on and on in great detail because Music is my LIFE and it gets me through :)|`|f9Ai4viDaa	I will post an honest response, and say, I really don't know.    Music is akin to art, liking it depends upon your mood, you can like it today and hate it tomorrow.    Trust me, I have bought records that I Truly have regretted buying, and painted pictures that no-one has loved.|`|siQ0hkVAaa	heavy music...some screaming, a good beat and good guitars, but lyrics are one of the most important things to me.  I listen to the music i do because the busy sort of angryness of it occupies my brain and either helps me forget whatever is bothering me or kind of lets me know im not alone :)  and the more upbeat stuff i listen to (P!ATD, FOB etc.)  im not really sure why i listen to that...i just really really like it :D|`|jDqpiEcOaa	mood|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Music is my therapy.  Mostly I am a classic rock fan and heavy metal.  They could say the words I couldn't say when I was growing up and it helped me get through.  I have loved music since I was very young and it has always been one of the most important things in my life.  I listen to new stuff so I can see what's going on and stay connected and have something to talk about with my younger relatives (took my nephew to see Linkin Park and we both had a blast!!)  I listen to my old stuff when I need to get in touch with some good memories from my past, or when I need to deal with some pain I may be in.  Love to take a drive and have some good music to clear my head and bang on my air drum which is otherwise known as the steering wheel!  I lost my Dad a few years ago but I have all his records and it helps me feel close to him.    I love lots of different genres of music and try to keep an open mind.  I also love to see it performed live.  That, to me, is like a drug!  It really makes me feel great.  I appreciate the talent that performers and songwriters have.  Love to see things like Riverdance as well - awesome!  I also have DVDs of music concerts that I like to watch.  It's like freedom to me.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	It makes me throb and feel alive.

Its very nice!|`|mNC4r3EIaa	Either I grew up listening to it, someone introduced it to me, I heard it by chance, or it simply appeals to my taste in music.|`|fC5X8swbaa	I feel like i can express my self with the kind of music I listen to. :)|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Because I can. The music I listen to is soothing yet not, if you know what I mean.|`|AA12380746	Because i have many moods and I can't commit to just one genre.    I use the music I listen to to make me feel good, sad, more mad, or happy...    just depends on the day.|`|AA11369432	It gives me a good feeling. It good to take your mind off the bad things   going on in the world.|`|UnQCBfc8aa	Music carries me off into different place (sorry if that sounded sappy)  I'd die if music became extinct or something|`|mggll8dRaa	It's pleasant to Hear & relaxes Me...!!|`|Jucak0HLaa	I listen to country because I've grown up with it,and everyone in my school and family listens to it.|`|jN0HJ4Zraa	i listen to my music because it is just so amazing and i understand the songs and it makes me feel better|`|eIzj5Zg0aa	i feel like im in a different world.

Western swing came in when I heard a Brad Paisley instrumental called "Make a Mistake with Me," which was in the style of western swing.  As for bluegrass, I actually may have liked that before I ever listened to Paisley, but after I first started listening to country.    How did I get into country music?  It's simple--my brother started listening to country radio and watching CMT after rock radio started to get boring.  I soon followed.  Keep in mind that that was back in 2005 that I started listening to country and, since then, I've purchased well over 100 country albums--modern and classic.    As for rock, blues and all forms of both of those, I basically got into them thanks to my dad being a fan of bands like Badfinger.  And of course, going to that B.B. King/Buddy Guy/Tommy Castro concert when I was in sixth grade sure helped me become a fan of blues.  The same thing went for when I went to a Scorpions/Whitesnake concert--it got me into 80's metal which led to me being a fan of other forms of metal.|`|U7E7Sn2eaa	because i like it...|`|F6eMQETlaa	Usually the lyrics have meaning for me and I can relate to what the artist is trying to put across.  The beat is important too.  I love to dance to my music and sing too.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	electronica, because it energizes me. it makes me happy. it doesn't grate on my nerves like  country or metal does.|`|K8QRRp2Oaa	because i said so.      AND    From the time of Pythagoras, science and music have been intertwined. Many of the milestones of western music theory, such as Rameau's Trait, have at least nodded to science for supplying the foundations of music. Science and music have been informally linked at Cambridge since the mid-nineteenth century. Sedley Taylor's 1873 volume "Sound and music", which included an account of "the chief acoustical discoveries of Professor Helmholtz", was intended to introduce his contemporaries to the new scientific insights on music emerging from Germany, while Charles Myers, later to found Cambridge's Experimental Psychology Laboratory, published pioneering research on non-western musical perceptions in 1905. With the institution of a paper of "Musical Acoustics" early in history of the Music Tripos, a number of distinguished researchers including Professor Sir James Beament, FRS, and Peter Zinoviev, computer music pioneer, contributed a scientific dimension to the Faculty's teaching programme.   The scope of research in science and music at Cambridge has been expanding steadily since the mid 1980s, mirroring the developments in the subject; in 1986 Ian Cross, a specialist in music cognition, was appointed to the Faculty to teach Acoustics and to develop the Faculty's then limited electronic music facilities, instituting in 1991 a final year course on experimental approaches to musical behaviours. The scope of research in science and music in the Faculty has broadened immensely; many graduate students over the last decade have conducted original research in topics such as music and emotion, music education, developmental pitch cognition, tonal pitch structures, duration perception, sensory integration in film music perception, the experience of polyrhythms, computer modelling of musical perception and human-computer interaction. Current research areas have extended even further to include aspects of reconstructive archaeology and evolutionary theory. Graduate research in science and music can be conducted within the M.Phil in Musicology as well as in the context of a Ph.D.     The Music School houses specialist facilities for experimental psychological research, computer programming, sound recording, and electroacoustic composition housed in its Centre for Music and Science (completed in early 2003). All major journals in the field and most significant recent book are available within either the Pendlebury Library, the University Library or other departmental libraries.|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	I like hard banging tunes..coz im on heart pills that slow me down..  and i love a beat...at least 140bpm..|`|MeGazyy7aa	My Chemical Romance-  They've saved my life once, and are in the process of doing it again. There music inspires me and makes me feel better.|`|CtUVT49Gaa	Cos rock music erm rocks!|`|1TRlzSsYaa	I enjoy it and most times, it corresponds with whatever emotion I'm feeling at a certain time. When I'm calm I listen to Dido or Coldplay. When I want to have fun, I listen to Christina Aguilera or Beyonce or Fall Out Boy or P!nk or Nelly Furtado or U2 or T.I. or Britney. When I'm angry, I listen to angry P!nk songs or Linkin Park or 89X (radio). When I'm sad, I listen to sad P!nk songs or the station 963 WDVD (radio) or Dido. When I'm bored, maybe the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or U2. Music is to discribe your personality, the guide to your heart. Music is something special.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	most of what i listen to lately strikes a spiritual resonance; it either answers an inner yearning [wagner's liebestod], expresses a desire for beauty and order [rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto], or describes a spiritual proscess [adams's harmonielehre].  sometimes, i listen to it because it's fun [rock lobster, planet claire].|`|cgqgomawaa	i either enjoy the beat, instruments or lyrics. songs have to have meaning for me. if they make me happy or make me cry then that's the one for me :)|`|4D6xfsnlaa	Rock/metal because it sounds good to me and has talent. I don't listen to teenage crap these days..|`|QBFjMRfuaa	Because I like the music I listen to|`|vZZU2Z4xaa	because i like the beet of it, and most of the guys in the bands are hot....=]|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Well first reason is that it's uplifting, but also for the musicians' skills|`|t4FBtIsTaa	Because it is good, why else?|`|GNcHTLisaa	it's fun and sometimes it makes me calm|`|F3oaDkT9aa	It's makes me alert, it's just fun to listen to|`|105Ti39vaa	All of my music has a way of putting me in a good mood.

I love music, check my profile for links to good bands!!|`|L9MDzufnaa	My cat chooses my music by biting me if he doesn't like it.|`|AA10240238	It is calming.  Mostly 40s and 50s.  Songs that usually had a story that you could follow and understand the words.  And no dirty words.    When I want a little more umph to my music, I put on   my gospel or irish folk.  Those give me the engery to  do what I need to do.|`|4aYNKp2Xaa	It's usually because it lifts my mood or because it has a message I really need to hear at the moment.  Take this morning for example.  I was feeling really overwhelmed with work and life in general and the song that came on the radio was exactly what I needed to hear.  It really encouraged me.|`|rftEZA50aa	It uplifts my spirits in this world of uncertainty, makes me feel that at least someone out there felt what I feel and wrote a song about it. That's how we identify with a particular song.|`|DPLjIsSaaa	Because I love the music that I listen to and that is why I listen to the music that I listen to.|`|10fef0b14524d535c54a941a510b7f6baa	It is usually helping me get through stuff... like i'll listen to songs that describe whats going on in my life or songs that inspire me if somethings wrong... so yeah...|`|mFz8EP0Zaa	The songs I listen to are always upbeat and have a fun tune to them, so it makes me happy and excited to listen to them.    GO ALL AMERICAN REJECTS!|`|UHGQI2p8aa	I love hippy 1960s 70s    I feel like it is deep meaningful and was put to a cause    When Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger (the rolling stones) sing I get goosebumps    Also my dad listens to the same type of music so we are always talking about music|`|kE1XCveZaa	I enjoy it with a passion.  It is one of the few good things I can love in this world.  The sound of it is good pleasure.|`|AA12361841	country music. it makes me high.|`|KucZ5Vlmaa	Cuz you listen to music and you might start to enjoy it.

Maybe, yes in Missouri, USA, but not in Utah, USA, though I hear men in England can be quite short normally.|`|GwmbrR3gaa	I would not be too concerned, but I believe that is around average or maybe a bit less. Depending on when you have your growth spurt, you never know what will happen. Just try looking at your parents to see how tall you MIGHT be, or as a doctor.     Hope I helped =D|`|rD3b5CETaa	well that would be about...    5 ft.  so yeah.|`|MFhQrOyuaa	ahemm.|`|c1b5c1de3f2bf9266efbd5d1416e2edcaa	Nope, you still have time to grow, just eat well, exercise and sleep well and you might reach 1.80 by the time you turn 18 or more. I must also say it depends on genetics, but you have to do the right time before genetics takes over.|`|OSR8q752aa	Umm ya, this probably isn't what you want to hear, but it's on the short side...|`|cOv322B0aa	yes extremely maybe talk to your doctor,    or it is in your genes. you could have a serious problem if you remain this height for a long time.

t2KJijUpaa	yeh i would too but shes a good actress lol.. imagine her if she was like that in real life..     Apparently Danielle reveals all to Ronnie on mothers day.. Its not soon, this week she think ronnie and her are getting close, everything proves to much for Ronnie and she breaks down and tells dot about her baby. they have a heart to heart and then Ronnie cancels going to the clinic with Danielle as dot has adviced her to as it is bringing back bad memories. Danielle tells stacey and stacey says two things main things "I never thought i would feell sorry for Ronnie Mitchell, your taking her to the clinic with you to kill her grandchild and you havent even told her" and "she might not want you" so its not anytime soon. Mothers day i think it will all be revelaed after all it does make sense.    Whitney and the family have not been in it so much as the whole Jack/Janine Ronnie/Daniele Stacy/Denise story lines  but she returns on tiffanys brithday where it is revealed a few days later Ricky is Tiffany's Dad.

44eKDvkhaa	A 3rd degree  3rd eye burn can be quite painful. What you need is to eat some Black Eye Peas and play with some cat's eye marbles.  Maybe wear an eye patch.

PhI5RCKXaa	i heard about that on the radio.  Etta was mad because beyonce sung at last instead of her at some ball for the president and Etta was mad because they didn't ask her.  my thing is Etta is getting older. she can't sing as good as she could when she was younger she can still sing just not as good. i see why she's mad but there really is nothing for her to get mad at. in my opinion.|`|9r1zw0evaa	t3h c00k13z?|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	Don't say that about Bey! She isn't overrated, she isn't a pop-puppet, you sound as retarded as that old cow called Etta!|`|9XpKTB2Saa	I think she will. Her generation has past and she probably just doesn't want to believe that. Beyonce is now and she's then. She should just deal with it and move on.
5ivdQt2jaa	Yes, and your poo is rich in antioxidants.|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|GlP7KECoaa	what r those?|`|sZGzUmLDaa	not really it doesn't really do anything

I've heard children singing who are a lot more musical than her
K7iR5wDBaa	I don't want to be harsh - I'll be honest. It sounds a lot like what a lot of youthful, rocky pissed-off-with-their-Ex's writers sound like. Try listening to different genres and really write what you are feeling, not what you are expected to feel.     To be honest, not even hit records lyrics are any good so given the right backing track and singer you could have yourself a top ten record !|`|B3uXT6qzaa	Yes, what ^she said.    Write about your pants and what colour they are and how they feel about you wearing them every day when they'd maybe just rather spend all day lying on the bathroom floor in a crumpled heap eating chocolate and watching TV in the bathroom.    That's the kind of song I'd REALLY like to hear. I want to know what your pants think about you.
LMTCohHyaa	not too long ago i used to smoke 8 or more....that was between me and a few friends...the more responsibilities we got, the less we smoked----the more you smoke the higher ur tolerance does get, so unless ur ballin out the gym and can buy more than the last time everytime, then it is in essence, a waste of weed---(tho id love to just blaze all day)---recently tho, im lucky if i smoke 2!!!|`|HmJOZbiYaa	drugs are for sad pathetic losers.|`|NGgUSm8Raa	i dont smoke blunts on a daily basis but i smoke every once a month|`|rD3b5CETaa	used to be like 1 or 2.  but i have cleaned up my act a lot, and only like 3 since the new years!  i am very proud of myself|`|gv33sD4waa	I don't smoke blunts.

Well, I do not really smoke many blunts. I smoke a lot of joints and bong rips. Yea, depends on me mood. I smoke 1 joint and 2 bong hits so far today. It makes class go easier, I got this one real boring one. So, anyway the girl I buy from she smokes blunts. Okay, well, I got to go ahead and head down to the store and buy some soda and bleach.

You were probably born when you were born because your parents had too much to drink one night.    The simple fact that you believe in astrology makes you the opposite of the best.|`|w4X6Y7tIaa	YES|`|PlA6c1iJaa	i guess|`|m5Hp56Beaa	Absolutely!!!!

AA10142515	I have been known to give to both.  I give clothing and stuff to the shelters and I have given money to them. If I  see a homeless person and they ask me for money, I have been known to dig out whatever change I have to give and I give it to them.  Once, there was a homeless guy on the side of the road with a sign that read,"I Don't want to work. Need money for Rum."  I gave him $5. I figured with Honesty like that, he should get more than a little change. He thanked me and asked If I would care to have a drink of rum "on him!"  I told him no.|`|FDt7cC8haa	So ..me giving him 5 dollars so he can buy booze or cigarettes is 'helping' him.....fascinating.....|`|xxSGhywoaa	All foundations are rubbish.  I'd rather feed a homeless person off the streets than give my money to somebody that I don't know how it's to be spent.      And yes, that's for ALL and EVERY foundation.|`|EpVNEzcSaa	i give my money to cancer research.|`|uCml0Ypxaa	I give money for the foundation, and I give extra food to the homeless.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Salvation Army.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Both when you can depending on the circumstances. Many are panhandlers, and you have to sort them out. You can with practise but sometimes you will still get burned. Anyway, sometimes the direct need is urgent so you have to judge. They may be dead by the time an agency gets to them. Use your judgement.|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	Both when I can.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	foundation.     one time a couple years ago, I saw a "vet" holding a sign on the side of the road. I gave him a couple dollars. About a week later, I saw him at Arby's talking very loudly about how much money he had "scammed" that day. I think it was in the $600 range. He also mentioned that he quit his day job for this.     I know they're not all like that, but I feel better giving to an organization that will give it to people that really need it.    I will gladly go buy them a burger and bring it back to them, but no money.|`|xESvfzQAaa	Always go straight to the source and give the person some money.  Don't care if they spend it on booze, drugs or food, whatever makes them happy, I'm not going to judge them.|`|AA11656632	Person|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	I help the homeless out everytime I see them ... as I have been homeless myself, 4 times on the streets of Chicago ....

"Out of the Shadows / Into the Light"|`|AA11945637	no, neither directly|`|nhZb43pIaa	Foundation - Food|`|bBHlGs5waa	I give to them when I can.|`|D9IbINdFaa	the foundation|`|wtrVyiNdaa	Yes if I have Change|`|xFXgkA95aa	Of course I do.|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	Both.  I regularly give money to my church (10% of my weekly paychecks) to help feed, clothe, and house the poor.  There are times, though, when I stop and give a random homeless person a dollar or two.  It depends on if they sign that they hold is funny or not.|`|A15bfvkBaa	I know a poor homeless family, and i help them once a month with whatever i'm able to give.. not always money. Clothes, food..|`|OXleDYVQaa	My Dad funds a homeless shelter and a women's shelter, and we feed them on holidays. Does that count?    Dallas|`|xhH3cB1Raa	I no longer give to homeless, I have learned that this just hurts them and keeps them on the streets. It's far better to give to organizations.|`|PzmLYUe6aa	I give to both|`|DVmDWDC4aa	If there's a store nearby open, I always go in and buy them a sandwich and a hot drink and give them whatever loose change I have. Even then if the money I give gets spent on something frivolous, they have a hot drink and something to eat.|`|gyhVnBN9aa	A homeless person can turn around and buy drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, so you never know if you are helping them for better or worse.    The foundation, if they are honest they will help people who are willing to ask for help and really are in need.     My answer: I'm most likely to give to a foundation.|`|3zYSNopUaa	i give to the homeless|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	I will offer them what I can. Usually that is food. I'll ask if they need something to eat, maybe a burger. You have to have boundaries when being charitable; if you get caught up in pity, you are simply another enabler of failure in this person's life.    Organizations like the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities do a lot to help also. You could really go either way and still feel like you're helping.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I've been approached by people here in the US and in Morocco, asking for money for food. The ones in the US look well fed with full faces, the ones in Morocco have sunken faces and really look hungry. I will give them money or if I am eating share my food, and they are so grateful for that.  I've donated things to homeless shelters, and there are food shelters and pantrys and food kitchens here, if the people  are really hungry they can eat at those shelters ( and take extras for other meals) instead of walking across the street to the Walmart parking lot and asking customers for money.|`|s4G6iCliaa	Sure
LSeuaYiqaa	The term "Women of Color" refers to all non-white women, including black women.|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	In the USA where I live,'woman of color' can mean Asian or Hispanic as well.I think the whole thing is silly--we are all just human beings!|`|0LUBf2Juaa	If she prefers to refer to herself as being a woman of colour then I think that's up to her. People described as black, have never, in my experience actually ever been black anyway. Same can be said of people described as white. I've never seen a white person in my life.|`|dKi2R2oHaa	Perhaps she has mixed ethnicity.  I suspect that she was emphasising that she was a woman.  'woman of black', sounds less poetic, than woman of colour'.     You would have been lynched for calling someone black when I was a nipper, then people insisted on being called coloured.    Frankly I don't care. If someone is going to describe themself by their skin tone, then more fool them.  We are all members of the same race, the human race and are decended from Africans.

Some women act the way a man wants them to in order to catch and hold him.  Their self confidence isn't enough for them to just be themselves.  That's so sad.  You can't act all the rest of your life.    Either he likes the real you or forget him.    So when he accepts the real you, you feel "natural."

3MB1Wsdaaa	We're probably just staying in and having dinner (most likely shrimp-my favorite).  By the way-if an engagement ring is given as a present-for Valentine's or on a birthday and you break up before getting married-she is not legally obligated to return the ring-it is a gift then. If it is done on any day then the ring is considered to be part of a contract to agree to marry so if you don't she is obligated to return the ring because the "contract" was not completed. Seems like a good day but it's not a safe day to give an engagement ring (unless of course you also give her a Valentine's Day gift which brings the ring back to a part of the contract)|`|peq2gAw6aa	alone:(|`|fSRqz7aYaa	I don't have one and I make a point of ignoring that stupid holiday.|`|w4gpEBPPaa	im a lonely **** so thanks for reminding me|`|uvn609hsaa	I'm all alone this year =(|`|AA10412319	i have no sweetheart :(|`|elECfJ52aa	nothing|`|GlP7KECoaa	nothing plannd, hopefully something special :)    and YES i agree its the day of LOVE why wouldn't you?|`|3yNh5jO8aa	My husband and I are going to stay at a resort for the weekend.

esybZyx3aa	Haha I like how no one knows about her. I just saw her in concert yesterday, damn. I should've asked her. She was really nice though. If you get the chance to meet her, you're going to be so happy.    She also has this really rad tattoo on her back. It starts like midback and goes down for a bit. I dunno. I was being creepy and listening into her conversation with some guy and they were talking about it.     I actually want to know too. I don't know if the first answerer is right though. I don't think it says that.  Anyway, good luck. If you find out, post it up so we can know!    :D    Ahh I could have swore I edited this like 2 days ago.

ZaSelz61aa	The Inconvinient Truth
TKsYoM26aa	umm these are the words that came to mind while listening to this song:    Poetic, beautiful, pretty, soft like sandpaper, fall of troy, experimental, atonal(without a key signature), panned harmonies, fast (maybe like 200 bpm), punk(vocal style), sweeping pans, metric modulation( the time signature changes when it goes into the electric part of the song. it goes from a 4/4 to a 6/8 then i think it eventually goes back to 4/4). the mixing is a little fuzzy. i like the f word at the end    but there is one word that i am missing.... idk........ i want to say good.|`|mZNhAbIWaa	This song freaked me out because it started out soft and ended hard The music is really hard rock I know you didn't want to here this but it sounded good at first but the heavier it got I couldn't understand the words.

I hold it true, whate'er befall;  I feel it, when I sorrow most;  'Tis better to have been loved and lost  Than never to have loved at all.    May hold truer for some.    Also, as I'm sure others would agree, losing love is surely worse than never having it.

PumYhJSvaa	Same price as the first time.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	Around here where I live it cost $5 to rent a New Release and for Old'er movies 99cents!    same price each time.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Here where I live, for a new release its 1.99 for a day, you got till midnight the next day to turn it in, or else it'll be 1.99 for each additional day.    For a week, its 4.99 for 5 days, and then after that it's 99 cents for each additional day.    Older titles are 2.99 for 5 days, with 59 cents each additional day.    Or 99. cents per day.    This isnt EVERYWHERE though, each town, city, state, blockbuster has their own thing that they do.    If a two bedroom apartment costs 500 dollars a month somewhere, the same kind of place could cost 1500 dollars in NY or LA or somewhere else. Do you understand? ITs different EVerywhere.

aLwrpMPXaa	I knew it ! LOL ! She had to be from New Jersey !!|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Sorry Grant as a New Jersey resident born and raised I can honestly tell you finding someone in NJ is very difficult because as small as it is. NJ is the United States most populated state in terms of density. Everyone lives on top of one another despite how small we are in square mileage. Also, I do not think we have many Armenians although I know a few. Best of luck I would try Cali though.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	Glendale California has a very VERY high concentration of Armenians.    It is a small part of Southern California.|`|vbznVd6qaa	She definitley for 100% lives in California    There is about 900,000  Armenians living in California   especially in Los Angeles.    Armenians are not even considered a minority here    She probably is from Burbank, Pasadena, Glendale, Hollywood  these are best options for you to look for her    Good luck!|`|VsamHLPOaa	I wish you the best of luck but it seems unlikely that you'll find her.|`|0fhCa5YOaa	Southern California has a lot of Armenians i wud know i am one.   Glendale, Burbank & North Hollywood|`|DxQc1tjOaa	wow very interesting.  i dont know that there is a way you could get her information legally.  there may be. . i dont know.  i'd say check new jersey first seeing as how it is smaller- find out that amount of armenian people in certain locations if you have her name you might be able to locate her by that.

GOFIl9w6aa	definitely there will be mosh pits.  And, even though they're not that intense, the pits definitely are, so be careful.  Also, they're really good live, or at least they were with their old vocalist.  I haven't seen them live with the new singer, but i love him, so i think they'll still be great.  I'm seeing them in a few weeks! so excited!|`|SoF1F4uJaa	I can't say I've seen ETF live, but I'd imagine they would be pretty good. There will be mosh pits, for sure, but don't expect warzones or full scale riots like at a Slayer or Converge show. It could get nasty in there though, so keep your wits about you. I reckon you'll enjoy yourself.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Wish You Were Here (1987)  starring  Emily Lloyd, Tom Bell, Jesse Birdsall, Barbara Durkin, Pat Heywood, Geoffrey Hutchings  IMDb synopsis:  In a staid English seaside town after World War II, young Lynda grows up with her widowed father and younger sister. Rebellious Lynda has been swearing constantly from an early age. At 16, she becomes more exhibitionist and seeks out sexual encounters challenging the prevailing lower-middle class attitudes to sex. She eventually becomes pregnant by an acquaintance of her father.

New Moon comes out November 2009  and Eclipse will probably come out some time in 2010    They want to make Breaking Dawn a movie but they don't think they can with the techonology they have because it would be to complicated. They want to though.    Hope I helped :]|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	With movies it all depends on how the previous movie does at the box office. Twilight was a hit so as long as New Moon makes just as much or more then the next one will be made.

cKuHXJQyaa	yeah, borders is giving you free post cards along with extra features for 30 dollars.    amazon and barnes and noble is just a basic package.  amazon is also selling one for 70 or so dollars and you get everything..charm bracelet, necklace, and other stuff but the movie is for blu ray only.    hot topic you get the "exclusive" movie cell, but it's just a copy, it's not a real one.    in my opinion, the borders one is the best. (that's the one i preordered)  it's a good price, and you get extra stuff.  the hot topic one is okay, but the shipping is too much and the movie cell isn't actually real.
7utWpFwnaa	that's not really sick, as long as it's not too...explicit. If you can't have a boy in it, then you've got to get a girl dressed up as a guy xD|`|1hciyvKdaa	I dont understand why no guys. It can be a one person play, it can be about a person pondering a new romance, but the letters keep coming from her lover who is at war. You can do it for any time period.  You need noone else. If you do it modern, you can do it as someone they met on the internet and feel they have fallen in love with, vs the peron they have spent a few years with, the delima is the lonliness and how to get past it to wait for the known lover, but thoise could be, they go to meet the stranger, never to be seen again.

BTW if a girl is willing to go in a boys outfit then i think its ok depends on wat character. dont force a girl into it.|`|L2AINddNaa	If you need to write your own play and there is only girls in the play you could make a really funny play. Here is the storyline the drama group is brand new this year and only girls signed up to be in it. So there really limited with what the can do. So they try a whole bunch of different acts that are Shakespeare and Jane Austin and people like that. But it is really funny because girls need to play guys in all the scenes and some of the girls may be bad actors well theres a start. Good luck hope it helped!

Catherine Hardwick wanted Robert to compose the song, and he was going to, but he decided not to in the end.|`|oVfqFHntaa	also, apparently robert pattison actually wrote bella's lullaby and does genuinely play it in the film.

If that is it, than "don't we know" should actually be "take me out".|`|c795udMRaa	could it be Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand it doesnt say "dont we know" but it has a good guitar and the chorus is kindof the same:    So if you're lonely  You know I'm here waiting for you  I'm just a cross-hair  I'm just a shot away from you  And if you leave here  You leave me broken  shattered, I lie  I'm just a cross-hair  I'm just a shot,then we can die  I know I won't be leaving here  With you    I say don't you know  You say you don't know  I say... take me out    I say you don't show  Don't move, time is slow  I say... take me out    I say you don't know  You say you don't know  I say... take me out    If I move, this could die  If eyes move this can die  I want you... to take me out    I know I won't be leaving here  (With you)  I know I won't be leaving here  (With you)  I know I won't be leaving here  (With you)  I know I won't be leaving here  With you    I say, don't you know  You say you don't know  I say... take me out    If I wait this could die  If I wane this could die  I want you to take me out    If I move, this could die  If eyes move this can die  Come on... Take me out    I know I won't be leaving here  (With you)  I know I won't be leaving here  (With you)  I know I won't be leaving here  (With you)  I know I won't be leaving here  With you

KXUsmiSdaa	well I never thought of him as anything even CLOSE to Edward because I am 100% team Edward.but I very much disagree on how they are thinking of putting bits of the Cullens through the film.It will ruin everything because New Moon is about that ending and the whole build up.but I'm sure all the team jacob girls will love it and the Taylor Launtner fans.I guess people who havent read the books will like him more because you get to know him a bit better and Taylor has been working out so I bet he will be selling  A LOT of topless pictures for magazines ect.However,I think I might be just waiting throughout the whole film to see Edward again like in the book,I've never read a book faster in my life!|`|BCu8rER4aa	got your question,..    yeah,.new moon is ,more about jacob and bella,..|`|JabqFBOkaa	Hmmm.. don't know.

I cant do any thing I'm dead, you try to pick up the phone but its impossible you are transparent and cant hold things up, you cry and cry and cry, blaming and feeling heart break and sorrow,  all of a sudden you......    TO BE CONTINUED|`|2dekavS0aa	You are huddled in your bed, and a flash of lightning reveals the little clown doll sitting on the chair (like in "Poltergeist"), staring at you with his plastic frozen smile.    The noises are coming from the attic.  You slip out of bed with your blanket around yourself and slip out into the hallway, with one last glance at the clown doll before you leave the room.  At the end of the hallway is a door with some creaky wooden stairs leading to the attic space.  The stairs are cool under your bare feet as you climb them, and open the door to the attic space.  When you open the door, the space inside is gloomy and your flashlight reveals dust in the air.    You gasp at the sound of thumping, and then notice that it is one of the shutters that has come loose and is banging against the side of the house.  You quickly make your way there, and shut it, and then head back to your room in relief.    When you get back to your room, you slip into the warm comfort of your bed.  But something is amiss--you're not sure what.  There is a thunderclap outside the window which startles you, and then a flash of lighting.  You look over to the chair.    The clown is gone!    You hear the patter of what sounds like little feet from behind you and you turn just in time to see the rustle of clothes in your half-open closet, as if something had just hidden itself in there.    Cautiously you slip out of bed and stare at the closet.  Calling all your courage, you reach into the drawer of your nightstand and take out the little hammer that you keep there.  Slowly, you approach the closet.  You reach out to grasp the handle of the partially open door.    ZZZZAAAAAPPPPPP!    A jolt of electricity passes through your fingertips and your body.  You give a yelp and withdraw your hand (whisps of smoke come from your fingertips).  The partially open door shows the wires that have been attached to the door knob from the inside.  You shake your hand, crying out, "Ow ow ow owie!" and suck your fingers.  In your surprise, you drop the hammer, which lands on your foot....    "Owwwwwww!" you cry as you hop up and down on one foot, clutching your toes.    You hear what might be a low chuckle and the patter of footsteps behind you.  You wheel around to see the rustle of your bed skirt, as though something has just hidden beneath it.    You swallow your fear and go to the bed.  As you prepare to lift up the bed skirt, you hear, from underneath the bed, a terrible sound.    "Reeeeeoooooooooooowwwwwrrrrrrrr!"    You gasp, just as your cat bolts out from under the bed, his fur all puffy and excited.  You bend down and pick him up.    "Oh, Mr. Kitty," you say, "poor little pussins, did something scare you snooky?"    But as you stand by your bed cuddling your kitty, you don't notice a small white gloved hand reach out from under the bed skirt.  The hand begins to sneakily wedge matches between the toes of your other foot....    You kiss your kitty and pet him.    The hand lights the matches.    "Mr. Kitty," you say, sniffing the air, "do you smell something burning?  It smells like something is on....FIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRE!"    You drop Mr. Kitty who lands on four feet and scurries safely away.  Grabbing your foot with both hands you begin to hop around the room cursing and yelping: "Ow! Oo oo!  Ouch! Dang! Hot! Oooiiiieeeeee!"    You hop to the bathroom where you soak your foot in the toilet (lucky it's clean!).  And you hear the sound of chuckling from your room.    Now it's war.  Grim and determined, you head back in....    To be continued....muhuhahahahaha!|`|r6oi1HyZaa	all houses make noises, its natural, plus it is raining...|`|k3Gzg3Kaaa	someone breaks in and trys to kidnap you but then you're boyfriend (or someone you like) comes in and stabs him but then the guy gets you both and stufs u both in a ditch and then you do it and then you are like both in love and then the police kills the guy and saves you both and you live happily ever after.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Don't worry, we all die some time, just that not all of us get slashed to pieces like you may well be about to|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	How about you crank up the music, and that will make noise, thts what i do.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Your mom comes home and walks in on you and your boyfriend!!

wvM4ok44aa	Hi, Badofilada. Seems like you're coming up with a comprehensive list of TV shows in local TV then and now.    To answer your question:    GMA-7: Discorama, Germcide, Germspesyal, GMA Supershow, SOP, Bongga (GMA TV 10 in Iloilo),     ABS-CBN: 'Sang Linggo nAPO sila, ASAP    To get your daily dose of updated in the entertainment scene, check out the link below.|`|ppOlG5S8aa	MTB which stands for Magandang Tanghali Bayan is a former noontime variety show in abs-cbn during the early 2000..the show includes willie revillame(who got suspended during that time and now has his own noontime show wowowee in abs)|`|EJUPEgS6aa	I remember in ABS-CBN-2 was Sang Linggo nAPO sila   and GMA SUPERSTAR in GMA 7... those were in the 90's...
ppOlG5S8aa	Magandang Tanghali Bayan(channel2 or 6)on abs-cbn as far as i can remember with amy perez,roderick paulate,randy santiago, john estrada and willie revillame(which now is the host of the current noontime in abs wowowee)..  also before that or after that there's mtp-magandang tanghali pilipinas which is quite similar to mtb  while on the other hand..gma channel7or12since then unti now has its noontime variety show..eat bulaga :D
ppOlG5S8aa	I don't really know about the former..but currently abs-cbn(channel 2) has its entrepreneur show "kabuhayang swak na swak" every saturday at 7am :D|`|24krc936aa	i remember "negosyete" of channel 7
tuATxHsVaa	The Vitali Chaconne is placed at grade 8 in ABRSM. I had to do a lot of checking and I hope I'm up to date on that. Some systems place it at various other levels. There are probably simplified versions of it floating around. You are playing the original, right?    I believe there are definitely simplified, grade 5ish versions. Maybe that's why someone told you it was "easy." The original is not exactly easy by any definition.     A lot of the piece is fairly straightforward - but emotion needs to be applied and that can be easily screwed up.    Listen to Sarah Chang play it:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AloBa9SPM...    It clearly gets more difficult at the end.    I can end this by saying that yes, it is a difficult piece of music. Not the most demanding, per se, but difficult none-the-less. I must admit that I don't particularly like to listen to it. It's just not particularly to my liking for some reason. Maybe it grows on you.    Enjoy.

lpyWVR2oaa	Being both Pisces Suns, you have an innate understanding of each other's innermost goals, needs and intuitively know each other's core essence.     However, you're more prideful than him with a Leo Moon and your emotional needs may clash with his ever now and then (his moon in aquarius is opposite yours). Your Venus in Aquarius is attracted to his Moon in Aquarius and this makes for very strong compatibility.     Overall, i'd give a rating of 7 out of 10 for this combo. Because u can be so similar in temperament sometimes, you may find that the partnership lacks excitement and stimulation at times. But this is made up for the innate understanding and respect you have for each other in your bonding.|`|re06t6zvaa	i dont think signs have anything to do with it.|`|7i66uU0Jaa	Firstly, it's not all dependent on star signs. But based on sun signs, you're both compatible but someone has to be the leader. For moon signs (emotions) it will be a challenge as you and your BF Moon signs contrast each other. You and your BF moon signs are very creative but while your moon sign will need self attention and affection from your partner, he will feel trapped while his emotions (Moon) is meant to be detached and strive for individuality. Though your Venus signs are in incompatible elements, they're compatible as Capricorn and Aquarius are ruled by Saturn making them unemotional signs. The only problem will be that you view love in a casual way whilst your partner view security and practicality as a necessity which you might find boring.    Overall, you and your bf are compatible but there may be serious problems on the way especially your moon signs.    Before you go in a relationship discuss what you both want, create a compromise and stick with it.    BUT, you shouldn't base your relationship on star signs.    The degrees in each sign affects out strong they're going to be|`|aXwA3ORnaa	your rasi lord is sun.  his rasi lord saturn.   you both behave like rat & cat. if he tells sit, you will stand.  so every day is war

dpYMlxA4aa	Del_icious is right. try to avoid the V/A albums. they tend to be compilations of the highlights. The problem with doing that is half of the power of the Finale to Mahler 7 is the build up into that movement.  In addition much of the time when these compilatoins are put together its lousy recordings to sell to people who don't know any better. now you know better, so don't do it.    You might try something like a soloist doing a variety of composers.  Something like Glenn Gould's Images is a good mix of keyboard music from the Baroque to the Romantic.|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm    http://classical-piano-guide.blogspot.co...   http://guitar-classic-guide.blogspot.com...|`|b75cd2f7bba03556108c51a587e8e491aa	Assuming you are in the UK....  The Classic FM radio station publish various albums of easy listening classical music.  Have a look at their website and check them out.      Del-icio    As much as I don't care for these best of albums myself, it gives the listener a chance to appreciate the various music available.  You can't expect someone to go out and buy Beethovens 9th on our say so, they may hate it.   They are samplers.  There is always the radio stations, Classic FM, or better still, Radio 3.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	While I am delighted that you are showing an interest in classical music (we always need more like you!). I would urge you NOT to go for a 'various artists' compilation album. There are already too many radio stations and lazy listeners who only play/listen to bleeding chunks of great masterpieces. While I recognise that, as a new listener, you might not be ready to take-in a whole Beethoven symphony (for the sake of example), it would be tragic if you got a compilation CD which had the overplayed 'Ode to Joy' section from Beethoven's 9th Symphony and you remained oblivious to the existence of the rest of the piece (one of the greatest ever written by a human being, incidentally).    You will get plenty of suggestions here, I am sure. Be brave - get whole works and explore them as you are ready. But please DON'T get a 'classical hits' album.|`|KWoaCTnFaa	Hello, I would agree that the collected works tend to just go for the obvious.  My way into classical music was to just start listening to it - Radio 3 (www.bbc.co.uk/radio3) is a really good place to start, such as the CD Review programme on Saturday morning, as they explain the music as they play the music - and not just small chunks.  You can also see the playlist on the webpage, which reminds you of what you were listening to!  Another way is to go to concerts - you can usually get cheap tickets and of course there is the Proms which is a really good way of listening to classical music, in a very democratic way - no musical snobbery allowed!!!      Otherwise, just go with what you like and ignore the music snobs - I went to a Russian modern music concert last year - and was the only person there who thought it was wonderful!!  Have confidence in your own likes!  good luck and enjoy!|`|rNqF4gIVaa	If  you are really new to classical music, I must take odds with the accepted wisdom here and say this...    Yes, it is better that you buy complete classical works, however there are some excellent compilation works by the best performers that are reasonable in price and have great performances of pieces by various of the great composers. Purchase of a few (and I mean very few) will give you a taste of each composer and hopefully leave you wanting more. The "Essential" series on Decca are great and whatsmore inexpensive. I recommend Essential Bach, Essential Beethoven and Essential Mozart for any beginning listener to classical music. Bear in mind that once you start to listen to more and more music, you will inevitably acquire duplicates of many well known pieces and the pieces on these albums will be the first to be duplicated. After a while, once you have really immersed yourself in what I like to term "art music" you'll even get multiple renditions of more obscure pieces. It is the nature of classical music CD's that some times small collections of works occur on a single CD.    So give these a try and see what you like. Good luck - you have opened the door to a whole new world.
lpyWVR2oaa	Harmonious Venus-Mars contacts between two charts are traditionally symbolic of strong sexual attraction and chemistry. However, this doesnt necessarily guarantee that the partnership will be long-lasting.    The most important considerations will be Sun-Sun and Sun-Moon contacts, esp. so if the male Sun makes harmonious contact with the female Moon. This is the classic case of the masculine yang energies being in tune and in sync with the receptiveness of the feminine yin energies. This is one of the best indicators for a long-lasting partnership.    Sun-Sun harmonious contacts show mutual respect for each other's life goals. It does not indicate sexual attraction but it does indicate that both parties are able to resonate with each other's core essence and intuitively understand the other's innermost needs and desires.

NV9FoM5Jaa	O.K. I may be able to shed some light here.I am an Aries and was in a 4 year on again off again relationship with an Aquarius.I understand the attraction and intensity of this relationship,it's actually quite frightening don't you think?Aries gets spooked easy,especially when feelings come into play,we don't know how to handle it and sometimes we would rather run off like a frightened deer until we figure things out.  Whatever you do let this guy breathe for a bit and make his decisions about you on his own,the best way way to get this guy back is to "back off" and give him his space,and you an Aquarius should know and understand that more then most.  If you don't do this and you pester him or act needy or whiny I can just about guarantee you,your hopes of getting him back will back fire.  If you want him back,let him go and spend time with family and friends,and do things for yourself(take the dog for a walk,take your little sibling to the park)that type of thing,show him you can live without him and his head will clear real quick.  Don't beg,pester or plead or you will lose your case.  Good luck to you!

XvG97CTPaa	Today I drove around looking for roadkill, and found a bird under the tire of a 1984 Camaro. It was too flat though, so then I decided to just buy pig's ears at the Latino grocer and sew them together to make something interesting, but I bought the wrong needles.

Walking to school I slipped on ice and fell on my butt. In German class we all got scolded because the professor didn't show up on Tuesday so we all left. He said we should have stayed and talked to each other in German for practice. Then I burped on accident in German as well, really loud, I was quite embarrassed. Then I got home and tried to make myself an omelet for lunch and mangled it beyond repair, looked more like burnt scrambled eggs with some veggies and cheese mixed in. AND on top of all that, I play an MMORPG (Final Fantasy) and was having trouble accessing my pictures taken on the game, so I went to their website and had them reset the password for just the pictures. But they actually reset the password for me to get on, so I couldn't get on the game at all. So I went back and told them they reset the wrong one, so they reassigned me a password for both logging into the game and getting to my pictures, and I went back and tried to get on again with the new password and it still won't let me. I'm mildly pissed. If my husband can't fix it when he gets home, I will probably be incredibly pissed, because we have dynamis tonight (we get on with a bunch of other people and do big fights together, sort of, I guess. Hard to explain to people who probably don't play the game.) Anyways, I hate not showing up for whatever reason when they are counting on me to be there.|`|44c352a49807fd606b77f2a102ce7a23aa	I just found out that a friend spread a rumor at school that I'm in love with my professor, which is partially false, I just love his voice and the way he speaks, he's very eloquent, but that's it, not that I'm "crazy" about the guy as my dear friend has pointed out.  Now what started as a joke has become a rumor that I'm afraid he's heard about, which is pretty awkward, kinda funny 'cause I wonder what he's thinking lol, but still awkward.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    I have Venus in Virgo. Good observation. My Moon in Sagittarius makes me very attracted to Sagittarius and I had 2 relationships with this sign and both were very good. Having said this, I had relationships with a Virgo, Capricorn, and a Taurus LOL.    The Capricorn attachment was the most intense (earth sign) as well as the one with Virgo. But our personality clashed especially too much. The Taurus relationship was the smoothest by far.    Venus in earth sign (in male chart) shows the type of women that we are attracted to or attract, and not necessarily the one you marry. For myself, I like a down-to-earth women, practical, but loyal and able to communicate intellectually. They have to have fire in them and not routine (Moon in Sagittarius).     Good question :-)|`|lpyWVR2oaa	If your Venus is in an earthy sign like Virgo, it does imply that you tend to attract friends and admirers of the Earthy, stable, salt of the earth type. In love matters, you are practical and down-to-earth, and tend to provide your services selflessly at your loved ones' disposal.     This doesn't necessarily mean that only the Earth signs will be attracted to you but it does show that you gravitate towards such individuals. Depending on your Moon needs, this may or may not be in sync with your innermost emotional desires.|`|AtCshxjZaa	I'm not sure. I don't really pay attention much to things about horoscopes. Sorry.  :(
gWXjNa4gaa	grammys are on this sunday, 9pm eastern time, i think and as for channels, probably abc
y8WBcehmaa	The woman at the end was his wife, Mrs. Lovett had misled him by saying his wife "poisoned herself." She did in fact poison herself, but did not die, she became the beggar woman you see wandering around the streets. This is also why she stares at Sweeney and says "Say, don't I know you mister?"    The little boy killed him because he knew that Sweeney was a monster, he had seen the horrible things that they had been doing. He was also aware that if he didn't kill Sweeney, Sweeney would probably kill him. It  was a matter of survival. I also have come to the conclusion that Sweeney wanted to die along with his wife which is why he lifted his throat as Toby approached and made no move to defend himself.|`|hwcb90FOaa	did you watch the whole movie|`|QfwXEAl2aa	Cause the lady at the end who died was his wife. He threw the other lady into the fire because she knew it was his wife but she never told him so he thought his wife was dead but she really wasn't and he ended up killing her.  The boy killed him cause.... he could!|`|ya1BqZFEaa	r u sure you watched the movie and payed attention to it???????  he was upset at the dead girl b/c that was his wife and he accidentally killed her.  he threw the other girl into the fire b/c she didnt tell him his wife was still alive she told him she was dead  the little boy killed him b/c he found out he was killing people and cooking them into meat pies|`|i0qmy2QZaa	the reason he gets upset us because he sees its actually his wife.  he threw her into the fire because hes nuts and wanted to get back   at Mrs Lovett for lieing to him about his wife killing herself.  and finally the little boy Toby kill sweeney todd because he knew that  if sweeney found him he would kill him, also to stop him from killing.  Hope that helped|`|zNLSWBmVaa	excuse me i love that movie!!! ok so sweeny has a beautiful wife and daughter! then the governor takes them away so sweeney excapes and went on a voyage and returned to an old friend miss lovette who is a pie maker and loves him. she has a son that found johanna sweeneys kid and tries to free her sweeneys wife got old and poor and depressed then he sees his barbering knives and when miss lovette lies and says they are dead he has an empty void in his heart causing him to go on  a syco path killing spree. then not realizing it he kills her and a last scream made him realize it s her! then he throws miss lovette in the fire and morns over his beloved wife then the little boy that promised he would take care of miss lovette kills sweeney and then he lies over his beautiful wife in peace. so romantic!|`|jwtRYXH0aa	Pssstt......I recomended visit .-*-.CAPITANCINEMA.-*-. com and enjoy full movies online AND READY TO DOWNLOAD IF U PREFER,new releases added everydays..just enter site in English And Join!|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	little boy killed him because he killed the women he loved cuz she was like i mother to him remember he told her he would do anything for her, and he was upset because that dead girl was his wife  that was taken from him al long time ago ... he was pissed because she told him that his wife had died. pretty easy.. are u a little slow or were you not paying attention..|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	He got upset because the girl was his daughter and he didn't realize it. The boy killed him because Sweeney Todd was a murderer. And the body was thrown in the fire because they were making food out of the bodies.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	The dead woman at the end (the homeless woman he killed) was the mother of his daughter (the pretty blonde girl) Mrs Lovitz(Helen Bodum-Carters [ya I don't know the spelling]) character had lied to him the whole time - once he realized she had he killed him too.  The little boy killed Sweeney because he had killed Mrs Lovitz who treated him kindly (no one will harm you, not while I'm around) and because Sweeney was killing people off and making them into meat pies - and meat pies made out of people are kinda groody.

g4APbW4Naa	Turner Classic Movies for 2 reasons.    1) NO Commercials.  The films are shown uninterrupted, the way they were meant to be seen.  I won't watch AMC, (which also stands for "Adds Many Commercials...")    2) The insightful commentary from the TCM hosts, before and after the films.  I find that they always enhance my enjoyment of the film, and tell me something I didn't know before.|`|AA12147036	I'd have go with TCM they have Cray Grant.  http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/Taking-a-...|`|H5BnOnvlaa	TCM has true classic movies. And no commercials.    AMC has modern classics (The Usual Suspects, An Officer and a Gentleman). But then it plays movies like Roadhouse and Death Wish 3. Those are classics?|`|PumYhJSvaa	AMC during the month of October. TCM the rest of the time.|`|tLI94qWNaa	TCM for me, always shows the best of the best.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	AMC !|`|Gm5u4vWUaa	TCM commercial free and better classics.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	TCM  for me.|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	AMC sold its soul! It went commercial, hacking up movies, showing recent ones that can be seen on the network channels and/or movie channels (which run them COMPLETE). I was so disappointed in them for throwing away what they used to be. Now, they even air series! Shame on them!    TCM is for those who truly love movies or all kinds. It isn't simply the classics. They even air "fringe" films, ones that are nearly impossible to find.     TCM is the champion!     AMC is the sellout!|`|mbhljk9Xaa	AMC all the way man. Its shitloads better.
BnTYoxUIaa	50 Cent ft.

cIqpL3tGaa	Oh uh, just do it, and dont ask?    I dunno man, wait till she is gone.|`|Gv606uKbaa	You could always sit in your garage  close the door  get in the car  close the car door   and   scream.  Maybe she won't hear you?  Or you could just wait until she leaves the house.  Thats what i do when i need to practice singing or whatever|`|Catsy82Caa	just say that you are a satanist now and that you require a goat for a ritual|`|qAEk6gDaaa	I just sing whenever I want to practice, no matter the time or the amt of people home. Occasionally they think I have lost my mind but it can help maintain the voice.
g4APbW4Naa	Well, we haven't seen "Week 2" yet, but they aired "Round 2" on Wednesday (not Tuesday).    I remember hearing "Mercy" by Duffy, and "Somebody to Love" by Queen.  "I Want You Back" by Jackson 5  "Some Kind of Wonderful" by Grand Funk Railroad  "Get Ready" by The Temptations (?)  "Don't Stop Thinkin' About Tomorrow" by Fleetwood Mac
sMa56Y0Laa	Noo. He can't rap (his only fans are 14 year olds) and now he's going rock? Yeah...right. He'll just end up ruining this genre as well.|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Love it? ..Love him? ..|`|LRLu1ofNaa	No!

d8YMxrqoaa	It depends on how advanced you are with piano overall, like whether you are very familiar with scales, chords, arpeggios etc. already.  Some things different from piano solos and guitar solos is that some jazz pianists will accompany their own solos and technique on piano is more straightforward; their aren't many piano techniques like sweep picking, hammer ons/pull offs, etc.  Piano is mostly about having second nature knowledge of where your notes are and controlling your sound.
a1Ngi39Xaa	Yeah I knew he was going to die, but the whole thing was a shock.  I posted a question about it earlier.  I was surprised at how I reacted to the whole show.  So sad.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	He sure looked like Nick didn't he.|`|LO3BMobRaa	Yeah I saw his ice block corpse.|`|RqeoCyzYaa	yes that thew me for a loop. it was really crazy. and having that young child out there what the heck was that kid doing on that ice after noah fell in the same place and that child was yelling for its mother. what the hell was the writers thinking.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	yes, but it didn't even look like him to me|`|qUiXiZ6aaa	i know it made me sad. that was so freakin' real looking they should have done something else..........|`|AA11626328	That looked soooo scary. Boo hoo    They should have warned us.  I didn't expect to see this.    http://cbs.com  They even have a clip of It.|`|Nwc5h354aa	Yeah i saw it, kind of intresting they went that route|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Yes, it was downright shocking. It was strange that they had a small child "find" the body. I wasn't prepared for that. It was grisly. Poor Brad. How on Earth did that happen?|`|lGdzb8aqaa	it was kind of sad and so real and hurtful.|`|I9FhmHkvaa	yeah i did see it, but that was yesterday for me, it was truly sad though, although i must say it looked alot like Nick's body, rather than Brad!|`|hDqH0do7aa	omg i screamed!!! that was so freakin scary|`|745d7d82d6eac9839609938eec95d1fbaa	It was pretty bad as the rest have pointed out.  I was surprised that his body was even found.  You know, typical soap opera storyline.  So they could bring Brad back if they wanted to later.|`|zo0O7hN4aa	yeah|`|KsyQ3SoMaa	I'm watching it as we speak. That was sooo scary when it showed Brad frozen in the lake. I started to tear up some, too.    Poor Brad :(|`|y1Sxd2nMaa	I saw it...I was a bit startled by it.|`|d9c0f5c5286294dcbb5ab28de65e8c39aa	Yes I must admit it was shocking how real it looked. Who was that screaming though was it the little boy who found him or his mom? But I heard the same screams in yesterday's episode. Poor acting by the way by the cast. I expected more tears..|`|BwHoLEHvaa	I was stunned when I saw Brad in the ice.  I didn't like the idea that they had a young child be the one who found him.    I really felt bad for Colleen.  She even had me crying!|`|vup6ylQ0aa	It was pretty cool|`|O0b9Kiosaa	Shocking, but I thought there would be more tears from Ashley and Victoria.  I thought maybe they would find him unconscious, then rush him to the hospital, everyone says their goodbyes, then he dies.  Kind of reminds of CSI's Gary Dourdan's character "Warrick Brown" departure-quick with no hospital goodbyes.|`|H3ss0n9Xaa	The boy who found Brad's body looked like the younger Noah from behind. For some reason they didn't show the front of the boy so the back does look a little like the charector who played younger Noah. So at one point I thought it was like a new scene. Like a memory of Noah playing on the in danger before and maybe I thought Nick or Sharon was having a flashback of the younger Noah playing on the ice in danger and almost killing himself. Like a memory. I don't know it seemed like it to me. From the back of the boy. When I saw Brad's body that looked like Nick, it was so sad, even if I knew he was gonna die, it was sad.|`|44aec316bb506db35b0cca1879ce6372aa	I think the writers were way off in showing that image.. I myself had been in a similiar situation where I found someone who died and believe me, the image is still in my mind.  They definitely should have posted a warning at the beginning of the show because it just wasn't appropriate for daytime viewing.|`|z4U9rKbNaa	Yes saw it, But Brad was supposed to have been a Navy Seal? A Seal would not drown!|`|Ifczxi6gaa	it looked real so it wasnt reall????? What the hell

ADZgFvozaa	These people come across as gentle creatures. There's something familiar about them -- they're the guy or gal next door. When they enter a room, they don't walk in with a splash. Instead, they move to the sides and weave their way inwards. These people have a familiar feel to them. Because they are rather sensitive to their environment, they can get flustered easily, especially in public.     Their first instinct, when threatened or on unfamiliar ground, is to protect themselves. When new situations present themselves, they can immediately withdraw or act shy. Generally, these people come across as caring people. They seem quite sweet -- even innocent. Usually, these people appear unassuming enough to be quite approachable. Some Cancer Ascendants, however, have retreated into themselves so much as to be quite the opposite.    Since Capricorn is on the Descendant, Cancer Ascendant people are looking for structure and security in their partner and their relationship. These people function best when their partner displays strength, financial and emotional stability, and know-how. In fact, many Cancer Ascendants prefer it when their relationship has well-defined rules. Security is the basic need, and they are generally more than willing to give up some personal freedom in order to get it. In some cases, Cancer Ascendant people can surprise their partners. Why? Because they come across as rather unassuming, family-oriented people. When it comes to marriage, they have a rather matter-of-fact, practical approach|`|HZxX9ke8aa	rising sign or ascendant means self-projection. if sun sign is your identity, ascendant is how people see you (because you present yourself that way)|`|ZII6YCk1aa	It means physically you look like a cancer|`|rnqgiRkWaa	google it =]      google rising sign in cancer!    it wrks every time ;]

Do excersizes if your good, but if your not good you wont get better.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Like everyone said, do the scale and sing your Do Rae Me's and hold the last note. It will help your voice.  Sing from your natural tone and keep going up the scale to the 8 octave which is high. I can get up to the 5 octave right now which is good. lol. Here's what I found for you. Good Luck! :)    Free vocal singing exercises online complete with midi scales to help you practice, plus singers articles and links to sites offering vocal exercises.     When you have mastered your breathing, the following free singing exercises will help you on the path to improving and understanding your voice.     The key to a good rehearsal is to ensure that you achieve the following before starting:   Abdominal breathing   Good posture   Breath during natural pauses   Keep your chin level   Keep your knees loose   Keep your head up   Keep your shoulders sloping and relaxed   Keep your toes pointed forward with your weight on heels and soles   Keep the front of your neck loose - don't stretch it   Keep abdominal muscles relaxed   Keep your back muscles relaxed   Avoid holding your shoulders lifted and puffed out   Relax and SMILE.   If your having a bad day or feel tense and stressed, this can affect your practices and performance. To help achieve consistancy do a few Relaxation Exercises before your rehearsal. If it all starts going horribly wrong, take a break, relax or do something else and try again later.     Stand with your shoulders relaxed, arms by your side.    Breath in slowly.    Sing one note, holding the note for as long as you can without becoming short of breath.    Do NOT suck in your stomach!    Repeat the exercise with different notes using doh, ray, me, far, so, la, te, doh.    Use different mouth shapes and vowels like "ooh", "ee", "a" and "aah"    Try singing up and down a scale (called an arpeggio). (Do this from your stomahc. Sorry but I hard to write this in so you would know.)    Sing short notes (known as Staccato) as well as long ones.    Practice along with our free online midi scales!!  Vocal Scales - Click Here     Sing phrases to improve diction: Examples:-  'I really love to sing' (going up the scale)  'Do,re,me,fa,so,la,te,do'  'La, Lo, Le, Lo'  'Ma, Mo, Me, Mo'  'Ta, To, Te, To'  'Hi, He, Ha, Ho, Hu'  'Qua, Quo, Que, Quo'  'Fluffy Floppy Puppy'  'Lolli, lolli, lolli, lolli pop'  'Bring back the boys big brown blue baseball bats'  'Sally saw silvester stacking silver saucers side by side'  (c-e-d-f-e-g-f-a-g-b-a-c--b-d-c up the scale then down the opposite way)   (suggested by Erica Zweig posted to Vocalist Newsgroup.     To feel the difference between raised and normal positioning of the larynx, place your fingers gently on your throat and try to talk as if you were a child or use 'baby talk'.     Record your efforts, notice the notes that do not sound right and concentrate on those until they do! Listen to the difference in your recordings over the next few weeks practice sessions to hear the improvement in your voice.|`|hKP5sQewaa	Singing through your Diaphragm improves your voice a lot i heard somewhere.|`|0zv9NHnaaa	just do scaless.     Like go to a piano or something and play the keys and match your voice with the pitchess.    Try and sing daring songs in your room.    The best idea is to get a singing coach. they teach the techniques better than anybody online.|`|TufsEE2baa	There are exercises that do improve your voice. You should really see a singing coach.    I sang in high school. They were complicated and you need a trained ear to listen to you to instruct you.    When you sing others can hear things in your voice that you may not be aware of. Without critiscizm from someone with experience you dont truly know if what you hear is the same as what someone else is hearing.    A coach will identify your strong points and weak points and adjust your vocal excercises accordingly.|`|0VGtGNspaa	PRACTICE!!!!!! just keep singing scales and tune your voice and just keep practicing!! :))|`|Tm5iVShQaa	You drink TONS of Mountain Dew right before you sing. Really, it works!
LCcW7KSsaa	Maybe with dark hair.    But no...not really.
x7duxnBLaa	Absolutely and if you're open to it, you'll receive the signs you need.  You might notice them on signs as you're driving by, words on the news on t.v., on someone's t-shirt as they walk by, the words people speak or on the license plate of the car in front of you at a stop light (and many other instances as well).     It's amazing how many answers I have received during my life with "waking dreams".  I have had instances where the very words I was saying were stated at exactly the same time I was watching a show on t.v. and this was a very significant answer to one of my questions at the time.  So, yes to your question.|`|U9xK6Wltaa	hell no, but they're kind of cool|`|ZX0dXmVkaa	eh not really..|`|4CsGde1qaa	I am a virgo, and most of the description on what a virgo is in terms of personality and workmanship relates to me by nearly 80%.

e65gCOWCaa	Don't give up. You shouldn't be mad at yourself for not being able afford a normal living. What's making it harder for you is the fact that all these benefits are coming out of the taxpayers pocket a.k.a. you. That's what's causing you to suffer. Most of the people, in my opinion, are just too lazy to actually work. It's great that we have benefits such as welfare to help people in need, but I think too many people take advantage of it and it's just downright unfair to the people who bust their butts everyday trying to make it.|`|dE5m2Krmaa	I feel that way ALL THE TIME!

Ow3O7h4caa	Even if the Ascendant is the same for both, it would depend on their Sun Sign, aspects to the Ascendant from other planets which would greatly affect the appearance.  A strong planet close to the MC would even influence the appeance greatly like for instance, Saturn strong would give a bony structure and give the person a Saturnian influence or Jupiter strong would put on weight, more idealistic, philosophical etc....    The reason I mention this is because, two of my friends have Sagittarius rising with the same planets in 1st house and both are 6 ft. The Scorpio Sun person, (often short in stature)is very skinny but very muscular with deep penetrating eyes and lots of magnetism with good looks. He is very stable in relationships.    The other one is a Libra with Sag rising and is slightly more better looking, same height but broader shouldered, heavier set and the eyes are fuller. He is more active and impulsive (Mars in Aries). is very fickle and relationships don't last long.  The other has Mars, Pluto, Sun with 3 other planets in Scorpio. He is more intense but more patient.    edit.....Forgot to mention that these 2 person above are best of friends although they do share similar interest, they are different in many ways.    edit....OMG...more smoke in my eyes Isabelle...!! I agree with some of your points .  I have Moon in Sagittarius in the 7th house and Gemini rising. I like what you said about 'you don't know who is talking sometimes' Lol....    Also, I meet many many Sagittarian male and female and get along with them as well as Gemini. Weird.|`|FE96lTPLaa	They will have similarity in appearance, but the all other peculiarities will be different according to their birth chart.|`|tQW18Kspaa	It would depend on a lot more than that.  You have to consider  Planets-9 + Sun & Moon  Houses-12 of them  Aspects -many different combinations|`|5l2kTANaaa	i agree with leftie up to a degree.     But take it further..    Am gemini ascendant and sometimes I really do not feel like writing much at all......lol..    Would I get on with all other Gem AC ? I doubt it......Sun etc will have a role into it. And blah blah blah ..    I suppose because am sag w/ gem ac...I tend to attract the same kind of people so do my venus, moon etc........( looking at my contacts).    I really think it is more complex than that..    But I think am a bit mixed up anyway.......having a Sag sun with Gemini ascendant....really sometimes I do not know who "is talking" :-)|`|y5dwVEK5aa	shore people who are alike are gonna have fusses.  this is so cozy i wanna join in the snuggle fest  but dont yous worry huney i dont kiss nobody widout knowing them better  so you dont have to share|`|cuIX13BKaa	In my case...those with Cancer Rising are a match made in heaven!

qN4Pt4kUaa	I am a HUGE George Lopez fan to begin with. And I love the show too! I watch it every night (which is three episodes here) even though I've seen every episode more than three times.. Seriously. They repeat the episodes too much but I still watch it anyways though.     I don't have a favorite episode. I can't really choose to be honest. And if I list all the characters I know, I'd have a big list. Let's just say.. I love and know this show really well. :)|`|xVXLhP0laa	i liked his stand up but idk about the show i saw the cheaters one it was kinda funny but george lopez as an actor just is weird|`|dQGqSqVpaa	i like the one with the cheaters that was hilarious when beenny said: cheaters! not again!!|`|UMRk2PoDaa	House of Payne

T.I. thinks he knows "everything about that" now that he's had a couple big songs. Almost like a smartass. And Lil' Wayne, since he had the hit song "Lollipop", he's been in 3 out of 5 songs.

It`s by the same guy who did pursuit of happyness.  It was a jumbled mess.  I mean, I got the gist of it the problem was they never laid out why he did what he did until the end when it was explained in all of 3 minutes.  The whole movie was quite slow and not well paced and the ending was kind of sad but not really.  Best way to commit suicide I`ve ever seen in a movie though.    Will Smith is always a decent actor and he was good, but this time seemed like he phoned it in.  Rosario Dawson really is teh only high point of the movie.  she plays her character well (and as always is damn sexy)    Overall though it was an interesting idea for a movie, it was original but it wasn't handled very well.
ajgC0KPhaa	"The Story of the Kelly Gang" (1906)     It is concidered the first full length feature film because it is longer then 60 mins. It was made in Austraila by J & N Tait production company and directed by Charles Tait.    .|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	Thomas Edison made the first motion picture camera if I recall, and it had no sound.     Sorry that's all I remember :(|`|TPPZp8IYaa	The first feature length movie was invented in Australia, in1906. It was called The Story of Ned Kelly.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	Ben Franklin|`|8nvesSFFaa	The first short was "Strongman Sandow" in 1890, if you discount the 1877 series of pictures showing a horse galloping. The first short with a story line is "The Great Train Robbery", and the first feature length film was "The Story of the Kelly Gang." The actors are Godfrey Cass, Nicholas Brierley, Elizabeth Tait,and John Tait. The first full feature color movie was "The World, the Flesh and the Devil" which made it's debut in 1914. In this film the actor who played the Devil is H. Agar Lyons.|`|RvOH0hjhaa	idk but the first movie with sound was called the jazz singer|`|GFXz4vlSaa	The first moving pictures didnt "air" - they were watched through viewfinders.  Later silent movies were watched in movie theatres.  Technically the first moving picure was of a running horse.  It was made with a series of cameras that were triggered by the horses legs as it galloped by.  The pictures were placed into a wheel and when it was spun, the viewer saw a galloping horse.  The inventors name was Eadbeard Muybridge in the 1870's.|`|rxlTrZw6aa	hmmm.i have no idea!|`|OL7gNJooaa	your mom hahahahahah no i seriously dont know|`|E2d8Dh1faa	obama..nah idk|`|oouAAdRXaa	A Frenchman Louis Lumiere|`|AJBR5P9daa	The Frenchman Louis Lumiere is often credited as inventing the first motion picture camera in 1895. But in truth, several others had made similar inventions around the same time as Lumiere. What Lumiere invented was a portable motion-picture camera, film processing unit and projector called the Cinematographe, three functions covered in one invention.    The Cinematographe made motion pictures very popular, and it could be better be said that Lumiere's invention began the motion picture era. In 1895, Lumiere and his brother were the first to present projected, moving, photographic, pictures to a paying audience of more that one person.    The Lumiere brothers were not the first to project film. In 1891, the Edison company successfully demonstrated the Kinetoscope, which enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures. Later in 1896, Edison showed his improved Vitascope projector and it was the first commercially, successful, projector in the U.S..|`|9Oul17Cuaa	you?|`|DnDXqFTXaa	The Eadweard Muybridge series photographs were made as an experiment to prove if a horses hooves ever leave the ground simultaneously (they do). The first moving picture made to be shown for entertainment purposes was "The Kiss". This made stars of John C. Irwin and May Rice. Thomas Edison's company made this movie along with others; "Sandow the Strong Man", girls wrestling while showing their ankles. VERY racy stuff for that time! These were made in the 1870's.  By the way it was not Edison who invented the kinetoscope. It was an associate of his named W.K.L.Dickson.

WQy4rliaaa	When someone talks about a third, it refers to the third degree of a scale, or the third note of a scale. Ask your friends what key the song is in (if they really are "big music buffs"), and then ask them to play you the "tonic triad", based on that key.     If you really are singng a third too often, you will be singing the middle note of that triad. The triad is notes 1,3,and 5 of the scale.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Probably the 3 octave  There are 8 octaves on the scale|`|Catsy82Caa	three steps up from the key of the song maybe? i've always found music theory terms to be confusing and stupid so i suggest telling them that you're singing it right and everyone else wrong

If you like to sing, then sing.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	You can't just get a singing voice quickly. Singing well isn't easy and if you want to be able to sing well, you have to work for it. Famous singers didn't just become a great singer overnight; they worked for it.|`|iNfDcN9jaa	Well I don't think you could get it just like that but maybe if you have the money you should get lessons! They are every good at what they do and it would help you if you really need it! I would suggest Long and Maude music centre they are good at vocals!|`|fUCxMtOGaa	take lessons, or if u r in school do boys choir, the warm ups they do there worked for me
BwHoLEHvaa	I sure hope so.  I certainly hope the writers wouldn't be cruel enough to have a baby die.  I think they should go the other way; Maxie & Johnny find Emma & Robin snaps out of her PPD.    I can't wait until tomorrow|`|dv17QJ9qaa	If they are right an dshe did take her to Audrey Hardey (off-camera) then why wouldn't she stay there with her until help arrived for them to get to the hospital to get Emma checked out?? But then with what is going on in the hospital Robin and Emma would have been safer wethering the weather outside and making it alot easier!!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yep she is safe and sound. If the spoiler sites and magazines are right...Robin took her to Audrey Hardy off camera.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	Baby is safe and sound.|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	If she isn't, I will be so sad!    I don't think Robin will be able to take it, what with the "Post Pregnancy Depression" or whatever you call it.   Patrick and Robin are finally so happy, and I would hate for them to have that taken away.  That family is adorable!    x?o|`|50d942fb9cb02a07ad994afcd5ea15fdaa	I am thinking the same thing but just remember how bad it looked for Robin after she had the baby & she pulled through.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I think she's fine.|`|EhBF31evaa	I think the baby will be fine.  Her mother is another story entirely.  Maxie and Johnny should find the baby and just leave Robin out in the snow!|`|gWlmU1KJaa	well it's 50/50    and even then she could come back as another actress in the part if she did die, and strangely, none of the other actors will ever notice or talk about it|`|AA11626328	I find It hard to believe that her mother Is   a Doctor. Poor baby,  and cute husband. lol|`|tgVGE2Umaa	I could see it going either way...being saved and having Robin so happy she snaps out of her PPD. Or she dies and spins Robin farther into her depression.
