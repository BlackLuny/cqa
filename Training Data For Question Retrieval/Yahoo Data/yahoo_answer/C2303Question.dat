20090220091032AAFk6c0	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	How do I find a rhyming scheme?	This a question from my English work...   The rhyming scheme of John Masefield’s “Sea Fever” is       A. a-b-c-b.   B. a-b-a-b.   C. a-a-b-b.   D. a-a-b-b.       "Sea-Fever"      I must down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,   And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,   And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,   And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking.      I must down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide   Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;   And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,   And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.      I must down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,   To the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife;   And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover   And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.

20090220094002AAL0TuJ	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Can anyone offer advice on the NYU versus Columbia Masters of Social Work programs?	I recently got accepted to both the NYU and Columbia School's of Social Work (MSW program). I am from Texas and know little to nothing about the difference between the schools from personal experience. My whole family is from NY, so I am familiar w/ it, but would like some input from others.      I have heard certain things about both schools:      NYU - The campus isn't really a campus (which I consider to be a minus rather than a plus...unless someone knows otherwise from experience). The school is considered to be in a more "hip" part of town. The tuition is more expensive than Columbia. Most people apparently don't live on or near campus (like up to 30 min. away)? Also, NYU offered me a $9,000/year scholarship w/ my acceptance email.      Columbia - The campus is very nice. The school is #4 in Social Work programs. The tuition is apparently cheaper than NYU.       Any advice you could offer about the programs, the schools themselves, their surrounding areas in NYC, etc. would be greatly appreciated!
20090220105541AArZ1S6	Education & Reference;Teaching	Fed up with this Teacher's Ridiculous Teaching Style!!!!?	Keep in mind this is a COLLEGE course. This class would be moderately challenging, but the teacher makes ALL of our tests/quizzes open book and open notes. Even pop quizzes are open book. For our homework, before we have to hand it in, he/she goes over every single question we had to do, so if you didn't do your homework, all you'd have to do is sit there and copy all the answers he gives(and I have seen people do this and the teacher doesnt do a thing about it). If a certain amount of attendance wasn't mandatory, it would be entirely possible to pass with an A just by coming on test/quiz days and homework hand in days. One of the students sleeps through the entire class everytime because he knows all the tests are gonna be open book so he knows he doesnt really need to listen to the lecture, and the teacher sees this and does nothing about it. It is so freaking frustrating because I'm actually paying attention and trying to learn something in this class, yet I know that the slackers will easily be able to pull the same grade as me because everything is open book. Is the teacher breaking any college rules by doing this or am I just going to have to put up with his/her lazy teaching style?

20090220110316AAXyS53	Education & Reference;Studying Abroad	Bright, American high-school student interested in studying in Europe... how would this work out?	Well, this is my first question on Yahoo! Answers and I'd like to get right to the point. As indicated by the question, I am an American junior in highschool and am in the top 10 in my class. Rather than attending an American university, I'd prefer applying to a European university full-time and not just spending a few months there. The only language I speak is English and this is my primary motivation. I hate being monolingual and am determined to learn another language in my lifetime.       I am interested in Scandinavia in particular and I know Sweden & Norway have great schools, but I'm also open to something like Reyjkavík University in Iceland. But now comes the big issue where I'm hoping to get some feedback: the language barrier. Are there courses in English offered at universities? If I were to go there, would I be able to learn the language spoken there while studying in English? I have done some independent research but nothing can substitute the knowledge of someone who has been through this. Thanks for your help.

At the first university where I sought work through the placement office, all interview sign-ups were essentially first-come, first-served -- basically anyone could reserve a time slot, although the recruiter could list desired majors.  Where I am now, you have to apply online using a resume and frequently a cover letter, and you can only sign up for an interview with the company if you receive an invite; furthermore, the system won't even let you apply if your class standing or major doesn't match the employer's list.

The brain goes through a dynamic change during adolescence and alcohol can seriously harm long and short term growth processes.  Damage to the brain through alcohol is irreversible. Drinking at a young age effects a persons learning abilities so they may not do as well at school. Late nights out with friends drinking leaves no time for studying which means poor grades and poor grades in important examinations means less doors will be open in the future.       i just need it to be longer? and it has to only be in educational factors not financial or anything otherwise?      thanks :D

20090220113528AAANZHw	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I need help on my black history month essay?	1915, Carter G. Woodson discovered Black History Month. His goal was to bring attention to the black people in America. Woodson published his findings in The Journal of ***** History, in 1916. He hoped to teach black people about their cultural background and give them a sense of pride in their heritage.      As the son of former slaves and the second black person to receive a degree from Harvard University, Carter understood the value of education. He felt the importance of keeping one’s heritage and was able to create Black History Week in 1920. He selected the month of February for the celebration of Black History Week because of two important African Americans. Abraham Lincoln, the U.S. President who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and Frederick Douglass, one of the nation’s leading abolitionists.      Carter provided learning materials to teachers, black history clubs and other communities that needed them. They also published photographs that depicted important people in the black's way of life.      this is what i have but i need a little more

20090220112302AAsKlBu	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Is it possible to "skip a grade" in elementary school?	My daughter is currently enrolled at a private Christian school, but next year she will be attending public school. I have heard that private schools are "ahead" but I am not sure...what I am sure of...is they convinced me to put her in an extra year of preschool because she was hyper (her fathers' genes! lol), and I like an idiot did it... I didn't realize the teacher told half the class that... So, long story, short version...my daughter just turned 9 and is in the 2nd grade. She is obviously old enough to be in the 3rd grade. Also, I might add, she attended fullday kindergarten, and the public school system here only has half day kindergarten which is 2 1/2 hrs per day...so with her being a whole year older, having a full year of all day kindergarten to back her up, and private school... I thought I could maybe get her up to her age bracket, as it is really starting to bother her. I called the public school student services and the lady said they don't do that...she cut me off...didn't even let me give details, which is why I am asking here... Does anyone have any information on this procedure? Is it law-based? District based? Any help would be appreciated. Also, if it helps, we live in Sylvania, Ohio...Sylvania Public Schools. :) Thanks!

20090220114531AAPYZBe	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Drug Testing in School?	My daughter is a Freshman in High School. She's a cheerleader and plays Volleyball. The School does drug testing on the Athlete's and they are random and they do them at any time of day. I'm all for the drug testing and was more then willing to sign the form. Well, recently my daughter was picked for the drug testing which she has been a few times before and past. So they call her after lunch to do the drug screening and she informed them that she had just used the restroom before they called her. It was 2:00 P.M. school is out at 3:10 P.M. They had her drink water and run (in her street clothes and converses). Remember she has been there since 2:00. This took place in the High School Gym..where the High School girls and boys basketball teams were practicing. By now it's 3:30 and the teacher has been yelling at her and telling her she needed to hurry so she and the clinic staff can go home. They tried to make her run some more which my daughter refused to do because she had already been running and her feet hurt from running in flat footed shoes, they tried to get her to drink more water. Which she was not able to do legally because she had drank enough at this point. The teacher went on to ask her if she was able to give a sample and my daughter informed her she could'nt. At this point my daughter is frustrated, humiliated and embarrassed because everyone was looking at her (the teacher is yelling). The teacher yelled out in front of everyone that they were her witnesses that my daughter was refusing the test. She did lash out at the teacher and was not willing to cooperate any longer. The teacher asked her if she was refusing the drug test, my daughter told her she was not refusing and that was not able to pee, then she was told if she could not give a sample soon she was refusing. My daughter reacted by saying "then since I can't pee then I guess I'll have to refuse." So it was an automatic positive. She was suspended from all sports for a year. I did take her the following morning to the clinic and had a drug screening on her at my expense which she did pass, and I have appealed the suspension. Isnt drug screening private and no one should know the results. She had kids texting her, and calling asking if she was afraid to take the test, if she was afraid she wouldn't pass it. Is there any legal action I can take to proove she was forced to refuse the drug screening, and that her rights were violated by exposing her results to student body. If you only have negative things to say about my daughter then I would appreciate them kept to yourself and don't respond. This is a child, "my child" we are talking about.

20090220123310AA8py8e	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Is this essay good for the writing of a 8th grader?	Give me some suggestions, please.    Famous Artist Paper         Christo is a Bulgarian-born environmental installation artist, known for wrapping famous buildings and landmarks with plastic and fabric sheets. Believing that people should have intense and memorable experiences of art outside the institution of the museum, Christo typically creates temporary wrappings -- generally lasting several weeks -- on a vast scale. Borrowing land, structures, and spaces used and built by the public, he momentarily intervenes in the local population’s daily rhythm in order to create "gentle disturbances" intended to refocus citizens' impressions. Such disturbances force each viewer to examine the way that social interaction becomes entrenched in routine and is consequently deadened.          Christo’s most impressive work is the running fence. The fence made from steel posts and steel cables, running through the landscape and leading into the sea. It was completed on September 10, 1976 and removed 14 days later. It consisted of a veiled fence 24.5 miles (39 km) long extending across the hills of Sonoma and Marin counties in northern California, United States. The 18-foot (5 m) high fence was composed of 2,050 panels of white nylon fabric hung from steel cables by means of 350,000 hooks. The cables were supported by 2,050 steel poles stuck into the ground and braced by steel guy wires anchored to the earth.            Another Christo’s impressive work is the wrapped walkways. In the project "The wrapped walkways" Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered 4.5 km of footpaths in Loose Park, a park in Kansas City, Missouri. Altogether it required 12,500 m2 of orange-yellow colored shiny nylon fabric. The artwork lasted 2 weeks before removing it.            Christo is successful artist to refocus citizens' impressions and letting viewers memorable experiences of art outside the institution of the museum. Christo work combined with nature and fabric gives viewer a new way of looking the nature. Like in one of Christo’s work the wrapped coast, it gives people unlimited guess of what it is being wrapped below the fabric. Some of Christo’s work also gives people a different thinking in daily objects. Some of Christo’s work represents unlimited hope. Like in one of Christ’s work the running fence, the ocean and the highway represents unlimited hope. Christo refocus viewers' impressions by a surprising and simple way.

20090220125736AAkg8W4	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Are you a person that likes to edit essay's?	Listen! by Stephanie S. Tolan , pages 1-197   Due: February 23, 2009      Character Analysis: Independent Reading       For this character analysis, I read Listen! by Stephanie S. Tolan. This novel tells the story of Charlene Morgan and a dog named, Coyote, who met at the slightest glimpse of an eye, and felt an immediate connection. Charley, the novel's protagonist, is struggling with her mothers death, the pain of her father burying himself in an eighty-hour workweek, as well as the recent loss of her best friend, Amy. Also the taming of Coyote which takes a lot of energy but in the end, it‘s definitely worth the time.         Throughout the novel, Coyote helps her come to terms with everything she has lost and as well as finding how to move on. Charley, the main character, is a twelve-year-old girl who recently unfortunately lost her mother two years ago. Her mother was a nature photographer who died in a plane crash in Brazil. After the horrific incident of her mothers death, Charley gets in a car accident with Amy’s older brother, Travis, who gave them a ride home from school a rainy afternoon in March. He was supposedly showing off and playing NASCAR driving. This lead to the car crashing into a tree, along with this disaster, Charley had shattered her leg in the process.         Charlie’s physical therapist insists that she starts walking so she decides to make her way around the nearby lake called ‘Eagle Lake.’ The woods held too many memories of her mother and her nature photography so she decides to avoid that area up until now. On her first day out walking along the lake she encounters a stray dog. She names him Coyote later on because he definitely has the appearance of a coyote, in her mind. Charley and Coyote have an almost physical connection; Charley can feel the trauma Coyote has been through even as he helps her to heal physically as well as mentally. Charley knows she somehow has to make the best out of her summer instead of sitting in a chair weeping her entire time. So she sets out, and starts taming Coyote. As she reads through all of the training books her father suggested she use, she knew nothing like training could get Coyote to cooperate. Each day she goes to Mrs. Davis’s and takes her dog named, Sadie, and brings her along a daily  walk. Coyote has always been around Sadie, so Charlie’s idea was to make Sadie follow her, then Coyote would come tagging along. Every day Charley would lay out a can of dog food at the end of her driveway to ensure that coyote would defiantly go for it. But, she wouldn’t. So Charley had to lay a piece of liver for the simple fact that dog food was probably used to lure in Coyote to be caught and put into a cage by people who wanted to catch him and abuse him. One day Charley was walking along the river and her bad leg had fallen into a deep ditch. Coyote, later on noticed her struggle of getting out so he went over and bit onto Charlie’s coat and dragged her back onto the ground to safety. From that day on Charley and Coyote became closer than they have ever been before, Coyote had actually touched her! She never thought that this would be possible because coyote was afraid of people.       It‘s almost as though Charley could see things before they happen, “Charley thinks about a dog too wily to be caught like other dogs. A starving dog that something really bad happened to. She imagines the golden dog with the wild eyes surrounded by people closing in to catch him and put him in a cage. It makes her sick to her stomach. “Maybe I could get him to come live with us.” Charley could also see the time when Coyote was in the woods and he was chasing wild deer around the lake, as he tried to reach for one to bite it, the deer had lifted it’s back leg up and had sliced Coyote’s nose. Charley had seen that happen in her mind, before it actually did happen later on. Although friends and family think Coyote is just a “Wild Dog” in their opinion. They are proven wrong, since Charley can connect to Coyote she knows she can straighten up this dog and keep him away from this shyness and his worst nightmares. Throughout the novel, she feels that she is going through a transition from “Letting go” to “Moving on.” This transition involves becoming more interactive with the fun times she used to have when her mother was living and letting go the fact that her mother is still in her heart and the memories they‘ve shared, and teaching Coyote that even though he has probably been through a lot, she can relate to him and is doing no harm to him. Her relationship with her hard working father falls back to pieces again when Charley tells him that the taming is a real success. The book’s title has a great significance to the entire story, the reason why it’s called Listen! Is because “It was what her mother used to say when she sat, camera in her hands, Charley on the ground nearby, waiting for the right light, the perfect puff of wind, a bird or squirrel or lizard to venture into view.

20090203035056AAbN2S6	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is saying OMG a sin? ?	In many books (e.g. the clique by lisi harrison) but also in real life, OMG is used all the time.    The commendment says you shouldn't pronounce God's name in vain. When you say OMG it's because you're shoked so technically it's not in vain. However, there is no reason why you are pronouncing the word "god" when you could say Oh my or Oh my sth else. So it is in vain.       My problem concerns teenage literature: I'm writing a book and I don't want my characters to say OMG, because I don't feel good when writing or saying it. The problem is OMG is teenage language nowadays. What do I do? What could I say instead of OMG?      I'm very interested in your opinion :-) Thanks!

What do you think?      Thanks for you opinion :-)

I can't decide what subjects to take. These are the ones I was thinking of:  Music, Drama, Business studies. Physcology,   As well as triple science and Religious studies and citizenship.    Are these good ?  What about for becoming a doctor?    I either want to either become a doctor a musician.    I am not sure what to take but I have done a LOT of research into becoming a doctor because I really enjoy learning about the human body. To be honest, that the main reason I want to become a doctor. It isn't JUST because I want to save lives (even thought ir is one of the reasons)  or JUST for money I do want an OK salary just like most people would. Is this a bad reason to become a doctor?     However, I absolutely LOVE music and preforming. I know it can be risky because its not guaranteed you will get a job.    Which path do you think I should take?  Can I somehow do both?  Is medical school really as bad as people say?    thank you sooooo much :D

And if you can't think of a specific quote, a part of the book is fine- for instance, I like the part where Ponyboy talks about how he and his brothers eat chocolate cake for breakfast, or when Two-Bit and the others are making fun of his hair after he cuts and bleaches it.

20090220143157AA21L62	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Question about trade/labor union scholarship?	One of my professors just sent me an email about a scholarship he thinks I qualify for. However, I'm not sure I do qualify. I've done a lot of community service for my college, but the award seems to emphasize trade/labor unions. Most of my service is in doing things like helping in elementary schools, organizing a holiday gift drive for the poor, and the like. Nothing really with unions, right?       Here are the requirements for my essay:    You should write clearly, with emphasis on your family background, your goals, and your activism on and off campus. Statements should include your involvement in student, labor, social, political, or environmental issues.  The UUP College Scholarship Selection Committee is interested in your dedication to labor union values and an understanding of the work of United University Professions.  The UUP College Scholarship Selection Committee wants to know who you are, what you do or intend to do that will make a difference to all of us, and what your goals may be.          Should I still apply, and how would I address the union part of it?       10 points for the most helpful.

So she'll do a quick 5-10 minute lesson and leave the examples on the board and give us an assignment to do in class. So we'll be doing this for about the entire rest of the period and 5 minutes till the end she'll rush up to the board and tell us she made a minor "error".      This will throw off everything, making us have to do it all over again. But she'll still make us turn it in! She expects it to be done. She does this every single day! I have an F now. I've been a straight A student since fifth grade. And now a big fat F. No one in the class has above a C. And she wonder's why we're all doing so bad. Out of 34 people, no one has above a C.

20090220121838AAXQRqy	Education & Reference;Preschool	My first day as a preschool teacher.. questions!... please help!!!?	Today was my first day and I was kinda thrown into it bc their old teacher quit just yesterday and I was thrown in there myself.  The asst. director helped me for the first half hour.  But after that I was on my own.  These kids were a little unruly and didn't listen too much.  I need to get them under control.  I want Monday to run a lot smoother.  Maybe their old teacher was very lax and easy going and let them do whatever.  Here are some instances of behaviors and I need to know how to correct them, how to handle these situations.. what to say to them to get them to listen..etc.      1.) At circle, I had to repeatedly tell students to "sit on your bottom" bc they kept moving around and changing positions such as laying on their belly's and then when one kid did that another kid did the same.. so I immediately told them both to sit on your bottom, thats not how we sit in circle"      2.) During circle again, one kid kept moving away and moved off of the carpet and I had to tell him to get back on the carpet and he didn't listen.. and had to keep telling me.. and eventually he did.. but it shouldnt take numerous requests..      3.) During circle, one girl went into the corner and between a bookshelf.. and sat in there and when I told her" come back to circle with us" she said no.. and I went over there and said "come on, everyones sitting for circle.. u have to too.." and she said no. and she was just refusing.. and i didnt know how to handle that situation..      4.) when it was time for lunch, i told everyone to go potty and wash your hands and get ready for lunch.. and one kid just wouldnt.  he was over by the couches and I said " come on, it's time to wash your hands and get ready for lunch.. and he outright said no.. and flopped on the couch.. and then i tried to take his hand to guide him to the table and he ran around the room and eventually did sit down with some guiding.. but like i said, he wouldnt listen to the verbal requests..      5.) when I tried to put one kid in time out.. i said come over here and sit here to think about what you did.. and he said no.. but eventually came over with some coaxing or more talking.. when he says no, what is a good response back to that..?  just be like.. im not going to ask you again.. come over here.  thats what i said.. but it took him a little more to come over... it seems these kids have no fear.. they think they can do whatever.. since this is my first teaching job, I need to know how to get them to listen to authority      6.) during play centers, it was more under control.. but some kids were supposed to be playing with a certain thing,but then decided to venture off and play with something else that i did not say they could.. and i immediately went over and lead them back to their original group.. other kids said i dont want to play this..      in general.. I just want to know the best way to handle situations like these.  And if any form of consquences for bad behavior.. what is the best method..

I guess that I have always been fascinated with history and the presence of things before us. I am a freshman in high school, and have recently been looking at colleges. I know that archaeology is a subdivision of anthropology, so I am just wondering about the major.       I guess what I am wondering is if the major is very similar, or the job in general. Will I be able to have a career working primarily in the field of archaeology? I'm also curious about the importance of human evolution in these two subjects.      Thank you very much :D      (I know its sad, but I am also unsure of the spelling of archaeology, so please don't pay attention to that!)

I can't use the word honesty until the last sentence that says "The word is 'honesty'." I just need some more ideas to put in. I need to relate it a little a program I'm in (This is what its for) called Youth and Government, but I can do that myself. Thanks! :D      Heres what I have:      "It is giving a value to truth. It is never telling a lie. It is being true to oneself and to others. It is being loyal, fair, and just. Whether it is giving contstructive criticism on a delegates bill, or helping a friend with their brief, one must act in a sincere way. It makes oneself worthy of trust. Without it, one is immoral and lost with no sense of guidance. [ADD MORE HERE] The word is honesty."

I have been trying for years to have my child tested for gifted and so has a teacher of hers.  I have just been informed that due to her standardized tests scores not being over 90 (which is debatable, she did make over 95 in at least 6 different individual categories) she is not eligible to be tested for gifted. Well, I still have the right to request she have her IQ tested which I will do anyway.  I am just so dissappointed and disgusted with how my county deals with education and wondered if this was the norm in other areas of the country.  They fork out thousands on special ed for slower students but trying to get help for the gifted is near impossible here.  What a shame!

What is the main difference between General Primary teaching, and Primary educcation and early years apart from the obvious emphasis on key stage 1 in the early years course? Would the qualification gained at the end mean that I would only be able to teach younger years? I enjoy teaching both younger years and older years, so wouldnt want to be restricted to teaching just key stage one! thanks in advance! by the way, i am fully aware that I shouldnt have picked the course just because of the location of the university. I would be over the moon to go to John moores and do the early years course, I was just wondering of the differences and whether it would be in my best interests to go to another university that was just Primary Education!

20090220130354AAM5lTM	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I want to transfer to NYU.  How likely am I to get in?	I got accepted into NYU the first time around, but I decided not to go because I was offered a pretty crappy financial aid package and I didn't like the sound of taking out so many loans.  I opted for the University of Florida instead because students who perform well in high school are pretty much given a full ride to any Florida college they choose.      I'm really enjoying UF, but I'm starting to regret my decision more and more.  I feel like I might have passed up a huge opportunity.  So my question is, what are my chances of getting into NYU if I apply as a transfer student?        Here's a quick summary of my high school stats:    - ranked 9th out of about 370ish   - 3.75 unweighted GPA/5.1 weighted   - recipient of IB Diploma   - active participant in a number of extra curricular activities   - 1500 SAT (2250 including the writing section)   - 700 in three SAT subject tests (bio, math I, and english).        I'm doing pretty well in college right now, though there's certainly some room for improvement.  And does it matter that I've already said no to NYU once before?

In today's world,every artists is expressing their views, opinions and feelings in their songs about what they have been through and what they have to say. I mean this is U.S right?, freedom of speech, the freedom to express yourself. It is not fair, that music should be censored in anyway. Alot of people think its only Rap that gets censored but, actually alot of other genres get censored like for example Rock. in some cases even the queen of pop herself Madonna gets censored.            Alot of large retailer stores sell Cd's that arent the Artist's original version but,some stores refuse to carry CD's with "parental advisory stickers". Some stores even go as far as Making it clear to the artists that if the Album comes to their Stores with a profanity word, controversial cover, and "explicit" lyrics it will not be allowed at the stores,some of the artists include Eminem, 50 Cent,  Lil Wayne, Dr.Dre and the list goes on, i mean some countries take this more seriously for example in Argentina, Miguel Estrella was imrisoned and tortured by the Argentine military junta      After researching censorship in music, I realized that there will always be someone or some organization to stand against what another person believes. I know that only way to gain full freedom of speech is to never give up. I do not agree with the censorship of music. i think that we are the ones responsible for what we listen too, not retailer stores, nor parents.for example my parents never judged me for what i listened to, nor said anything and i grew up to be very a responsible young man because i got to choose my own path, i know some kids my age that they're parents never exposed them to anything "explicit" and once they get older they explore it themselves and they go crazy.          Also, an Artist's music is an expression of themselves andwhat they have done and been through. censoring their music,changes what they created I would find that very insulting if I were an artist. I think that for a parent to decide whether their child is old enough to listen to a music album is censoring , they must listen to it themselves.       I also think music is an important part of a teenager's life. I know in high school I often used music as a "way out" from stress, problems, etc. For some, they are living the music, in a ghetto with parents with drug problems. For others like me, who fortunately did not have any of those problems, we simply just use it when we have a bad day. I believe that music censorship contradicts our first amendment to the Constitution, freedom of speech. telling a music artist that they may not use certain words is the same as telling a certain newspaper that they cannot print a certain article in They're opinions.

I'm writing a paper about an environmental issue in my region that is important to me. In my city I've noticed a lot of development over the last ten years that has had noticeable consequences as far as damage to land and wildlife, pollution, etc.      So my question is does this qualify as an environmental issue? it's not clear-cut like energy waste or global warming, but it had to be local and this is the biggest one I can see. Thanks!
20090220132110AAjxP4U	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Whats the right job for me?	Im a sophomore in high school and i cant figure out what i want to do. I think i want to be in the engineering field. My interests in school are math and science, only math based science tho. I hate english and history. i like to solve problems, but im not that creative. i like to learn things in those 2 fields and if i dont understand something, i work at it until i understand it completely. I'm also big on music, like listening and playing and whatnot but that doesnt have to do with anything. My interests outside of school are sports, video games, weightlifting, my girlfriend :), and my drumset. Right now, in math i've done all algebra courses and in geometry right now. Science i did bio (hated it) and im in chemistry which is far better in my opinion. I dont know if this was enough information or not, but i was just wondering what kind of job i would be best at or might like the most. Thanks for your help in advance :)
