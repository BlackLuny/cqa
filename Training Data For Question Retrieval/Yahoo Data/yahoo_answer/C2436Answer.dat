ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|gs8MSMs3aa	ok, so here is the thing.  judgment of people before they are found to be guilty of something is a key thing in tkam, they judged boo radley before they knew him, they judged mayella, and most obviously they judged tom robinson.  so when a man who did nothing is hinted to have been killed in jail, a woman who is raped by her father is so scared of her father that she tell everyone he is guilty making her look at least poor in the eyes of the public, and little did everyone know that boo was abused so that is why he hurt his father, it is all a cry for help by the people who were wrongly judged.  tkam is begging for both civil rights and an overall attitude change and a lack of prejudgment. i hope this helps :)|`|o55pe3Qmaa	Hey, I have the same prob here!

bLnjJ6Cbaa	I know what you mean. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but when I read I feel like my brain is working better and differently than if I wasn't reading, especially if I'm thinking about what I'm reading before, during, and after. The same goes with textbooks, too; I have to read my textbooks to study, but it has to be active reading where I'm taking notes and looking up words and constantly flipping pages. :) Yes, I've also noticed that if I haven't read anything in a while, I can't think or feel the same way I can if I'd been reading. Not that everything that you called "inspiration" has gone away, just that I need to get my brain back into shape, you know? It's been dormant for so long that it needs to stretch and warm up again. I think writing is like that, too; if I don't write something, even an essay for class, and think about what I'm trying to write, my creativity in other areas becomes limited as well. There's a barrier, a wall blocking my capacity to come up with new ideas or even questions to ask. I feel it limit my vocabulary, too. Of course, I'm not a writer, but for me at least there's a connection betweent reading and writing and thinking creatively, and doing better in my biology class.<br>  <br>  If you don't have lots of time to read or if you don't like reading long works, you could try for some short stories or poetry. As long as you're reading :) Can I ask what you read recently that made you feel this way?<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I articulated this well enough, especially this early in the morning, but I really like your question!|`|t8xFyCt0aa	You are probably right. People who don't read... well, sometimes it's pretty obvious. It is exercise for the mind, and like with muscles, without exercise it all wastes away.|`|e4067f6bd29072f4b98c388ae450ba75aa	My Grandma used to say "Use it or lose it!"  I think that is true with your mind.  Reading keeps your brain stimulated and you are forced to use your imagination, when you just watch t.v. or video games it's all done for you; all you do is watch so your brain isn't really doing anything. I feel much better reading than watching t.v., I even eat less! LOL|`|PsarWirtaa	i have 2 read every day or i go a bit crazy!<br>  but i do feel like that only it's not positive  things<br>  but that could be because of the books i read!

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

yJCdLNHwaa	It is a very beautiful poem.<br>  I felt as if I were watching all this unfolding before me.<br>  <br>  There is nothing to fear, but fear itself.<br>  That death is not to be feared, because without death there can be no life.<br>  It is a cycle which we all must endure, so when it is nearing open your arms to it, embrace it and cling to it, knowing that you are contributing to the Circle of Life.|`|8c8ca69ba60952337e6a67121fe756c9aa	I think the fear in this poem is of the eventual end, still to come, and how it may be purposeless, not even a meal for a Great Bird. This is part of the architecture of the fear of death: that if in the end, we do not have a purpose, then our lives are negated. I don't agree with this, but I think it is a hurdle we all must leap over, an existential blockage we all must, someday, find a path around (or through).<br>  <br>  Thanks for posting this, quite enjoyed.|`|T0fwqL2baa	He seems to be looking at death in a very pragmatic and accepting way. In accepting that the inevitable (death) will occur at some point, it seems to take the edge of fear away. Morbid yet fascinating..|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	When death stares you in the face, you see it differently.  There is beauty in every facet of life.  We only die once, it should be examined up close.

Seeing the beauty in death and the beyond.<br>  <br>  I will definitely read more of Jeffers.|`|n9hRyHpqaa	It is a beautiful poem.  I did not feel as though he thought he not good enough for the bird, but  the bird knew it was not ready for that fight, that day.  And yes, he is thinking of his death.|`|1wOBfgZIaa	Robinson Jeffers is one of my favorite poets; I have loved his work since I first met him as a high school sophomore at age 15. This is an excellent example of dialog within a poem. The poem teaches us that beauty exists after death (or after life on Earth or Mars).|`|GomZ9oYHaa	To me there's no need in fearing death. He was lying on that hillside faking his own death just to see how far he could go with it. I did that one time as a kid lying still on the grass and watching those buzzards circle.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Death was feared, then becomes a beautiful respite, when it leaves him to live - he laments that he can't "live on" in the bird.|`|bNRUjnGZaa	He has accepted that death is near but not there yet.  I think it also means that the body is nothing compared to his spirit soaring.

p0AUrLgwaa	According to the late Western novelist and researcher Louis L'Amour, the old west was actually a very quiet place. seldom would you hear gunfire. Events like the gunfight at the OK Corral were the very rare exception rather than the rule. However, women were treated much better than most would believe. Because there were so few women in the Old West, they were treated like the rare commodity they were. If a man passed a woman on the sidewalk and didn't tip his hat, he was at the very least poorly treated by the town. If he actually put his hands on her or so much as jostled her causing her to fall or have to step off the sidewalk rather than him stepping off to allow her to pass, he ran a very real risk of being lynched!<br>  However, towns like Deadwood, Tombstone, and El Paso were for the most part sleepy little villages with little to no excitement. It's only Hollywood that makes the Old West appear violent.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Other than a very few cattle towns and mining centers the Old West was really pretty quiet.<br>  Just remember many of the homesteaders and small ranchers than Hollywood uses as prey for the bad guys were actually Civil War veterans and knew how to make effective use of firearms and weren't afraid of a couple of punks with pistols.

Well, actually, I always loved it and always danced, but I was never able to take lessons until I was 16 and I have been very serious about it ever since day #1. The question you should be ask yourself is, "what kind of job do I want?", "how hard am I willing to work?" and "where do I want to go with this?" Yeah, it's probably too late to become a Prime Ballerina of ABT, but very few make a position like that no matter their training. If you work hard enough then there are MANY things you can do with dance, so give it all you've got. If you go to college you can major or minor in dance or just take classes for fun.

WApucF8waa	There was inflation all across Europe because of the gold and silver the Spanish conquests brought in. However, the Spanish "Hidalgo" mentality was not well-suited to building an economy, and Spain simply spent it! The Netherlands and Britain sold exports to Spain and collected a great deal of the metals, even though they were enemies of Spain.<br>  <br>  In a way, it did not cause enough havoc, because it didn't produce much in the way of a permanent change.|`|swlqQ1mYaa	According to my history teacher (three years ago), it was because of inflation. At least, I think that's what it's called - I don't take economics, but I can kind of explain it.<br>  <br>  The Spanish loved to take gold and silver from their conquered territories. At the time, the metals - especially gold - were the most precious things they knew of. However, the Spanish didn't know about the concept of supply and demand (I guess it is) and simply let it all flood into circulation in Europe. Because there was suddenly so much of it, its value plummeted in Spain, and the economy was destroyed. This was further aggravated beacuse Queen Isabelle and King Ferdinand had expelled all the Jews from Spain, and they had been the best money-managers in the country.|`|3906b0dc53b49757cda1fb524b5353d4aa	One word-inflation.

6vwePTksaa	Tscha. Ich denke allerdings auch, dass sich Rowling da ein wenig zuviel zugemutet hat (oder ihr von au?en zugemutet wurde),<br>  In meinen Augen ist es beispielsweise problematisch, Hauptfiguren einfach durch "Tod" zu eliminieren. Eben weil es "einfach" ist. Ziemlich sicher war die M?glichkeit eines Ablebens von H.P. am Anfang nicht mal gedanklich eine Option. Ich denke, die ganze Geschichte war schon eher als "Heldengeschichte" angelegt, mit Happy End, und meines Erachtens h?chstens bis zum vierten Band vorausgedacht.<br>  Dann aber hat sich die Sache ein wenig verselbst?ndigt, der Druck wuchs. Auch der Erz?hlstil entwickelt sich doch ziemlich von Band 1 bis 7 vom Kinderbuch zur Erwachsenenlektüre. <br>  Drum denke ich auch, dass vor allem Band 5 bis 7 eher "gepresst" erscheinen und nicht wirklich von der Muse geküsst, also so stimmig und leichtfüssig wie die ersten vier B?nde.<br>  Nichtsdestotrotz lese ich die ersten vier HP B?nde immer wieder sehr gern. Einen Nobelpreis allerdings sehe ich da nicht. Jedenfalls nicht, bevor nicht auch K?stner einen bekommen hat. :-)<br>  <br>  |`|3e56f09710d7b2a1dff32277b88f9114aa	Ich kann dich verstehen.<br>  Aber, du darfst nicht vergessen wie lange sie an den Büchern geschrieben hat! <br>  Auch wenn sie die Geschichte im Allgemeinen schon jahrelang im Kopf hatte, die einzelne Umsetzung all ihrer Ideen, all der Charaktere ist doch mehr als schwierig.<br>  Beim ersten Buch hatte sie noch alle Freiheiten. Mit jedem folgenden Band wurde die Freiheit immer kleiner, der Zwang alles plausibel unter einen Hut zu bekommen, riesig.<br>  Natürlich kann es da schon vorkommen, dass mal etwas nicht mehr so richtig passt. Hagrid hat im ersten Buch gezaubert. Ja, und danach nie mehr.<br>  Es hat in dem Moment gepasst und hat Harry geholfen zu erkennen, in welche Welt er nun treten durfte.<br>  Natürlich war es nicht besonders plausibel, in Hinsicht auf die weitere Geschichte.<br>  Und ich bin mir auch sicher, dass J.K. Rowling nach Beendigung des letzten Buches, all die vorherigen noch mal überarbeitet h?tte. Wenn sie gekonnt h?tte.<br>  Aber, da hatten wir die Bücher ja alle schon verschlungen. Also, musste sie, genau wie wir, mit diesen kleinen Unstimmigkeiten leben.<br>  Und ich muss sagen, ich lebe sehr gut damit.<br>  Und was den Rassismus gegenüber den Schlammblütern angeht, irrst du dich. Der Begriff wurde zwar erst sp?ter gepr?gt, jedoch hat Draco Malfoy schon im ersten Band seine Abneigung gegenüber Hermine Granger sehr deutlich zum Ausdruck gebracht. Das war schon der erste Ansatz des Rassismus.<br>  Was die Frau geschaffen hat, bewundere ich zutiefst. Jedes einzelne Buch von ihr, hat mich glücklich gemacht.|`|v3g7j52Daa	Hey, sie ist auch nur ein Mensch :D<br>  Sie hatte vermutlich das Gerüst von Anfang an geplant, aber die Details haben sich dann hald ergeben. Denn mal ehrlich, wer kann schon über so viele Jahre so viele Seiten im Ged?chtnis behalten. Im 7.Band werde aber doch einige "R?tsel" aus den vorherigen Büchern aufgekl?rt. Und ich fand es auch sehr sch?n, dass es sich teilweise bis auf da 1.Buch bezogen hat, so dass man diese Dinge dann in einem anderen Licht sieht, wenn man es nach der Lektüre des 7.Bandes, noch einmal liest.<br>  Ich bin der Meinung, dass ihr diese Saga sehr gut gelungen ist und die Bücher eine logische und auf einander aufbauende Reihenfolge ergeben. ...und natürlich gibt es Unstimmigkeiten, aber das geh?rt dazu und ich finde es irgendwie noch charmant. |`|eiw3wLETaa	<br>  Die ersten B?nde sind richtig positiv und auch für Kinder noch geeignet. Im letzten Band fiel mir die seltsame Wortwahl auf. <br>  Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass die den letzten Band nicht selber geschrieben hat.|`|MM4Te9hPaa	Da habe ich ziemliche Zweifel, insbesondere was den 7. Teil anbelangt. Für das, dass alles schon sooo lange geplant war, kommt mir das Buch vor, als w?re es auf die Schnelle hingekritzelt worden.<br>  <br>  Trotzalledem wünsche ich ihr, dass sie in ca.30 Jahren den Literaturnobelpreis bekommt, da sie den Kindern die Freude am Lesen wieder beigebracht hat.|`|XEfKzRecaa	Ich denke, dass sie die Geschichte eigentlich schon fertig hatte. Allerdings kann ich mir auch gut vorstellen, dass sie im Nachhinein noch etwas ver?ndert hat!<br>  Um ehrlich zu sein, mir sind da keine Ungereimtheiten aufgefallen!<br>  Ich mag die Bücher so, wie sie sind.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Oh, I wish I spoke more Deustch. I just happened upon this question, and I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, but... ich ... um ... don't remember reading any "Ungereimtheiten" between first and seventh book, but it's been awhile since I've read the last three books in detail, so...<br>  <br>  The only thing I wish she had explained was the Veil. I know it was the Department of Mysteries, but she really didn't explain the Veil, the Time Room, the Room of Love... She sort of left that huge gap there without explaining anything.<br>  <br>  I really do love that series, though. :,D<br>  <br>  @ Gaunab: Ja, she should get the "Literaturnobelpreis." :)<br>  <br>  Es tut mir Leid, dass ich nicht spreche Deutsch. :(<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh good!

The conjugation for 'thou' is strange, I'm not quite sure how you decide whether to add 'est' or 'eth' or anything else.<br>  5.

Thou hast long hair. Thou likest chocolate. Thou livest in England. Thou shouldst not believe everything thou hearest.(NB the ending of the verb changes when you're using "thou" not "you" -  usually to -est, but very common verbs like "have" and "be" have their own forms - "hast" and "art")<br>  <br>  You use "thee" when it's the object of the sentence ("Thee" is to "thou" what "me" is to "I")<br>  <br>  e.g. I hate thee. I will give thee my last Rolo. I need thee to read this.<br>  <br>  You use "thy" as a possessive ("thy" is to "thou" what "my" is to "I", and what "your" is to "you")<br>  <br>  e.g. Stop playing with thy hair. Thou hast forgotten thy book. Hast thou finished thy essay?<br>  <br>  "Thine" is to "thou" what "mine" is to "I" or "yours" is to "you"<br>  <br>  e.g. Put that down, it's not thine.

XvO4iLk0aa	G The mind doesn't forget and suppression just makes the memories come out as disease. The thing to do is to turn poison to medicine by using your experience to help other people. You have endured, therefore you can help those who are enduring, if you use the LDK consistently.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

That is - I think I am, I don't think about it, worry about it. But more often than not I realize, when I do mention it to someone, that I wasn't really ready to let go until I'm ready to talk about it.

Anyway the point of "talking about it" is to know that other people might tell you the same pain they experienced. Therefore you are not the only one. Nowadays, you can find other people bad experiences on web.<br>  <br>  The way is to FACE the pain. One thing is to know or understand that LIFE is not built perfectly suitable for you.

This is for the standard 6X9 book size format. When you type out a page on Word, it is usually about 525-600 words.

M. Kaye.  <br>  <br>  It's a (very long) historic romance novel set in India.  It chronicles the life of Ashton Hillary Akbar Pelham-Martin (aka Ash), who is born in India and is raised for a time under the belief that he is Indian, although his biological parents were British.  He's adopted as the playmate of a young Raj-to-be and there meets the boy's sisters, including the little girl Anjuli, who idolizes him.  <br>  <br>  After a time, Ash runs away, is discovered to be a British child, and is shipped off to Britain to be educated and brought up as a British citizen.  He returns to India in the service of the British military and eventually happens upon Anjuli once more.  He had forgotten her, and now he's in charge of supervising an escort as she and her sister are carted off to be the brides of a single (and highly disgusting, I might add) Raj.  As you might imagine, he and Anjuli develop an attraction, but pursuing it is impossibly complicated.  <br>  <br>  It's a great book (it's been made into a TV movie and at some point was being adapted into a musical), and it covers many topics, including love, war, and both Indian and British cultures.  Highly recommend it.|`|yish6BTIaa	Georgette Heyer! She wrote historical romances set in Regency era England.

I think the form is somewhat stultifying, which is why I tried and leaven mine with humor, although I sacrificed the initial sonnet rhythm to do it.<br>  <br>  Yours has an elegiac quality that makes the stiff structure work for you. If I understand the goal of the form it is to "break out" in the middle without losing the thread so to speak.

nQ3kFPMVaa	Yes! Stay in school and keep doing drama until you graduate. As your school is a bit 'behind', do your best to join and participate in local indie films, amateur theatre groups, etc. There are lots of university courses available, even in Brisbane, for which you can look them up in your local course guide. Be sure to produce your own shows or films if there's not a lot going on around you; start your own acting group! Oh and feel free to ignore Krazy Kid; he/she is an idiot and has bad advice.<br>  <br>  First off, check out local auditions at theatre.asn.au, or read up on Aussietheatre.com. If you're keen, pay for a membership at QuietOnSet.com.au or Artshub.com.au; they list heaps of auditions every day around Australia. Another good site is screenhub.com.au.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb.<br>  <br>  <br>  AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY.<br>  <br>  Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.<br>  <br>  If you don't have experience don't expect a professional role or an agent. I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it. <br>  <br>  Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.<br>  <br>  Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.<br>  <br>  DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions.|`|uzIhl6wUaa	You should get a different  studio. That is the first step. Then ask them  for advice.

6k8GJBRPaa	The alliance was a cause of it. Serbia and Austria were in war, because of the murder on Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Because Serbia was allied to Russia (and Russia to France and UK) and Austria to Germany, it became a World War. So, in this view, yes, the alliance system is the cause of making it a big war. Otherwise, it would have been a war between only Austria and Serbia, which would be forgotten.|`|yish6BTIaa	I don't think it was the main cause, because war would probably have broken out anyway (just maybe later rather than sooner). But the alliance system most likely made it into a world war.
b7U12SHpaa	Shakespeare was probably the greatest playwright of all time. His writing is so beautiful and unique, everything he writes about, his sonnets, his poetic writing, you just have to read one page of Romeo and Juliet to understand how mysterious and amazing William Shakespeare is. I wish so much that people these days talked like Shakespeare did. Shakespeare is still taught in school today as it is a classic, even now, over 400 years from when it was written, people still love Shakespeare. He is an amazing playwright.|`|KqIDH7oVaa	er firstly  cluster bombs great idea you dont need to be there to kill people, ergo time to surf the net, second wasnt shakespeare english? after all we owe lots of words to shakespeare|`|iaHM24Xjaa	I agree shakespeare is boring - i'm studying him now but i think its compulsory because his work is very important and his works are renouned for the way they are constructed and how well written they are.

8dlxCanCaa	OK well one good basic stretch to start out with is the butterfly (sit on the ground with your heels together). Gradually keep pushing your legs down so your knees touch the ground and put your head to your feet (or nose to your toes as my dance teacher would say to the younger kids =]) and that stretches out your turnout muscles. Another good stretch is the frog stretch and the way I do it is that it's basically the butterfly stretch (heels together, legs bent) except you put your knees on the ground. Heres a picture of it because it's hard to explain.  http://gvctemp17.virtualclassroom.org/sp...  Now not only do you have to stretch those muscles but you also have to strenghten them. The clam and piriformis excercises are really great for turnout IF you do them the correct way. This video is amazing for explaining and showing the correct way because if you don't do this excercise the right way it can be bad for your hips..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa-0NRMg8...  Lisa Howell is a dance physiotherapist so she deals with dancers and the bodies of dancers so check out some more of her videos; They really help dancers with everything possible. Good luck and i hope i helped!!!!  =]|`|46zxsu1haa	If you are past puberty, and have been dancing for a long time, there is just so much you can do to improve your turnout. It might just be the way you are built. Talk to your ballet teacher about it and keep trying the stretch that works on turning out your rotators.  If you are very young 11 or younger, you have a shot on improving more, but don't count on getting a 180 turnout if you can only barely turnout now. Good luck!      What ever you do, don't pop your hips by forcing your butterfly. You could really do damage to yourself!|`|dnMvibooaa	you have to get your hips more flexible. do the butterfly or frog stretch ever day for at least 10 minutes. if this doesn't work well, i'd ask your teacher for some exercises|`|h6b4kNm4aa	lots of ab work outs.

xdcqgaASaa	Well, firstly, quote "I know you exist because I can think" unquote<br>  So, if everyone else doesn;t exist, how can you feel them. Logically, if they didn't exist, you'd go straight through them. Even if you thought you were touching them, you'd notice if you hit something.<br>  And, if this is a light show, as you suggest, then how does everyone else give you an unexpected answer or create sounds, etc.<br>  Then, theres the question of how you came to be alive if everyone is an illusion and how we have technology and inventions if the people who made them or invented them never existed. My piano teacher once said that if Steinway and Sons never existed, he wouldn't be the pianist he is today, but he was doing a promo for Steinway pianos then.<br>  <br>  My argument is full of holes, but I think the strongest point is that you wouldn't be alive now if noone else existed.|`|AA12079397	If you believe in your existence then you have to believe that everyone else exists because you are one of them.|`|11dGXLchaa	I have no reason to believe that I am in a universe that is reflecting myself for all eternity.   I have seen no evidence of it.   I believe that everyone else exists because I have no other choice.   If I cannot trust my observations, I become a helpless actor in the only reality that I am aware of.   It is of greater benefit to me to believe what I see and thrive in what could be a delusion, than to doubt everything and fail in all realities.|`|uyQXdKLiaa	The fact is you don't know everyone else exists, but on the same token you don't really know anything. The important thing here is that you believe that everyone else exists. And you do. There is no good answer to this question, but this question doesn't really need to be answered either.

Anything by Robin Hobb you will NOT be able to put it down. IT is classified as fantasy, but there is SO much more to it. I have given the books to people who HATE fantasy and they have eaten them up like candy. I am pretty much ruined for all other books because Robin Hobb's are perfection, they have everything. I'd suggest starting out with the Farseer Trilogy (Assasin's Apprentice is the 1st) Then she did a second trilogy spinning off from that series, another trilogy, Liveship Traders, and the Soldier son trilogy. All are just awesome and you won't be able to put them down. She used to write under a different name, but I couldn't quite get into megan lindholm's stuff.

44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	I think they are very good, but not stunning. Maybe it's just the subject matter. I don't like the really big name, it's distracting. Lovely colour and atmosphere. The second is more to my taste.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Image one has lovely tones but horizon is slanted and splits image dead center. A bit of a crop will enhance it.  Image two...fascinating! Dramatic lighting and leaves you wanting to know more.  Image three has pleasing warm tones but no real point of interest.  Image four very poor blown out exposure. Doesn't appear to have much composition even if it were exposed better.  Image five no main focal point, way too busy. The colors are nice and I think you should have honed in on one flower, knocking the rest out of focus.    I hope this helps and encourages, rather than discourages!|`|0CA2FJ48aa	impressive :) and it will get much better with time if you practice|`|crFPLMbsaa	image one is a beautiful looking shot but it is not a very strong image.  i think a little sharpness would have helped and also another subject. eg- a small white boat floating in the water    Image two...very nice but i would place that big silver thing higher up in the frame and have your human subject more dominant in the photo    Image three is very nice but you have a major loss of detail in the trees  if you want a silhouette i'd go all out and loose all detail    Image four it's a cute photo, it's kinda the look i've noticed is in fashion now. i'd bring back some of that green towards the left though with a very wide soft edge brush and give it a slightly more realistic aged look.    Image five i don't see it being improved, it really does nothing for me.  if the red flower is the point of interest get in closer and show that flower. aiming the camera a little upwards can perhaps give you a less cluttered backround ?    and  i think you have potential and if you keep at it you will definately get better. have a great time shooting :)|`|D9x1QSgiaa	I enjoyed ALL of them except the 4th photo showing light flare into the lens.

And your question is not rhetorical.<br>  <br>  Questions of philosophy do not have to steer clear of rhetoric; it often makes for a more intriguing question.<br>  <br>  But actually the best questions rely on the philosophical arts themselves, asking specifically pointed questions based on variables of the basics questions:<br>  What is existence? (Metaphysics)<br>  Why do we think the way we think? (Epistemology)<br>  What are actions proper to the nature of man? (Ethics)<br>  What structure of politics best serves the nature of man?

I accept the criticism and your impatience with the "Throw-it-back-in-your-face" effect, but I often answer questions with a rhetorical question as a means of making a comparison much like a metaphor.  I put the question back in the questioner's face in a different way, as if I am saying, "If you think that is okay, then you would have to think that this other question is equally okay."  Let me do (be) the example:<br>  <br>  Does answering a question with a denunciation of its content make you a philosopher?  For example, answering a question about the nature of the self with "There is no self!"?<br>  <br>  There are actually two types of valid questions we Answerers should be asking Askers.  <br>  <br>  Critiquing the question:  If there is insufficient detail posed, or a hidden perspective which should be proven before "taking the bait."  <br>  <br>  Reflecting through comparison: As described above.
xl6JVATSaa	Andrew Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act. This allowed for the removal of both Cherokee and Choctaw indians from Georgia to Oklahoma. Removed from their traditional lands they suffered from decease, poor diet and maltreatment. Many died on the way and many more on arrival.    1864 the Navajo were move to Bosque Redondo (Fort Sumner) from their traditional land which they had occupied from the 16h century. Although the walk took 20 days these hardy people were left with little to sustain them. They could not hunt for meat as they were allowed no weapons. And when they arrived the great feast they were promised was no more than watery soup.     The 1830 Act allowed for expantion in the west just as it allowed for the freeing up of lands in the South and East.    Read Dee Browns "Bury my heart at Wounded Knee"|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Are you referring to Mao Zedong's Long March? This was basically a military retreat by communists during the early stages of the civil war. The Communists, under the eventual command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed some 12,500 kilometers (8,000 miles) over 370 days in 1934-5. Of the 100,000 soldiers who began the march, only about 7,000 made it to the end.    The Trail of Tears was the forced relocation and movement of Native Americans from their homelands to Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma) in the Western United States. The phrase originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831 Many Native Americans suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their destinations, and many died, including, for example, 4,000 of the 15,000 relocated Cherokee. In 1831 the Choctaw were the first to be removed, and they became the model for all other removals. After the Choctaw, the Seminole were removed in 1832, the Creek in 1834, then the Chickasaw in 1837, and finally the Cherokee in 1838.|`|TzogAxLFaa	The Long Walk was a book by a Pole called Slavomir R..(something.  Can't remember.  Ends in a Z).  It purported to be a true story of how as a Polish officer he was sent to Siberia by the Russians in 1941/2; and how he escaped and walked from there to India.    I say purported, because it's probably fictional.

This is also really good piece however is alot more emotional as ritsa ( the person i play ) is quite 'mixed up'<br>  <br>  btw i'm guessing your a girl like me so both theses pieces are for female <br>  <br>  both are aimed a 20 year olds however i'm only fifteen and there ok for me!!<br>  <br>  hope you do well and get the part you want!
d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	It could work; but you need a lot more conflict.<br>  <br>  People read novels because the protagonists are continually getting into trouble, and the reader is constantly forced to ask, "How will they (he/she) get out of this?"<br>  <br>  In your case, you have a basic "Romeo and Juliet/Beauty and the Beast" plot. So please know from the beginning that the idea is pretty fairly worn before you invest further time with it.<br>  <br>  However, if you really feel strongly about it, you will need a great deal more conflict to carry out the story. For example, only some of the circus people can be on their side. The majority must be opposed to them (this will heighten the tension).<br>  <br>  Her family and friends must also find out and be opposed as well (causing more tension).<br>  <br>  How do they continue to see each other?<br>  What obstacles do they meet along the way? <br>  How do they overcome them?<br>  <br>  Do you see where I'm going with this? <br>  <br>  The secret to writing is one of Tension-Resolution leading to BIGGER Tension-Resolution, leading to BIGGER STILL Tension-Resolution, etc, etc, etc. Until you reach the climax of the story at the end.<br>  <br>  That's why you need a lot more tension in your story. Okay?|`|M9FiPNQ4aa	I think you have a good idea going there. Just work on it some more & let us know how it is going. You can only give me 10 points though. that is all they allow!!

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	A mastaba was a flat-roofed, rectangular building with outward sloping sides that marked the burial site of many eminent Egyptians of Egypt's ancient period. Mastabas were constructed out of mud-bricks or stone.    When a mastaba was built for the burial of the Third Dynasty king Djoser, the architect Imhotep enlarged the basic structure to be a square, then built a similar, but smaller, mastaba-like square on top of this, and added a fourth, fifth, and sixth square structure above that. The resulting building is the Step Pyramid, the first of the many pyramid tombs which succeeded it. Thus the mastaba is the first step towards the more famous Pyramids.    A ziggurat was a temple tower of the ancient Mesopotamian valley and Iran, having the form of a terraced pyramid of successively receding stories or levels. Some modern buildings with a Step pyramid shape have also been termed ziggurats.    The earliest examples of the ziggurat were raised platforms that date from the Ubaid period during the fourth millennium BC, and the latest date from the 6th century BC. The top of the ziggurat was flat, unlike many pyramids. Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a pyramidal structure. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven, with a shrine or temple at the summit. Access to the shrine was provided by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit. Notable examples of this structure include the Great Ziggurat of Ur and Khorsabad in Mesopotamia.    The ziggurats had no internal chambers.    CONCLUSION: Both were raised structures with flat tops. Mastabas were tombs, while ziggurats dwelling places for the gods.
ceBTTCPwaa	In the story, Cratchit is seen at work, where he copies letters by hand in an underheated "dismal little cell", "a sort of tank", and in his small Camden Town home with his large family on the following Christmas Day and a future one, gatherings which Scrooge visits invisibly with the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, respectively. Cratchit is repeatedly described as "little", and clothes himself in a tattered white comforter, not being able to afford a coat.<br>  <br>  Though Cratchit is treated poorly by Scrooge, and, with a weekly salary of "but fifteen bob" (about ￡56/US$109 in 2005 money using the consumer price index), he is not given wages enough to feed his family a proper Christmas dinner, he remains loyal to his employer, even in face of the protestations of his wife.

The Cratchitts represent poverty - for Scrooge the thing he fears most in life - yet are cheerful. The charity collectors represent selflessness - something which makes no sense at all. Nephew shows kindness to his uncle - whereas everyone else fears and shuns him - this Scrooge cannot understand having long ago surpressed love for anything other than mooney. It is all part of his redemption that he comes to appreciate that the issues each of these interactions raise are an important element of the Christmas tradition - and not Humbug.
ceBTTCPwaa	The Ghost of Christmas Past visits Scrooge first and takes him to see his time as a schoolboy many years earlier. Here it is suggested that his father abandoned young Scrooge at his boarding school, even during Christmas. This is relevant to Scrooge, because it shows the beginnings of his lack of socialization and empathy. He does not socialize because he never experienced steady growth in a strong family unit. He does not empathize thanks to the way he was treated: as a child, he was the least of his father's concerns, and this in turn taught him not to feel for fellow humans. Furthermore, his mother died giving birth to Ebenezer, for which his father blames the boy. In some versions of the story, his father goes to jail for not paying debt. Later the ghost shows how his success in business made him become obsessive and develop a workaholic tendency. His money and work-obsessed personality traits eventually compel Scrooge's fiancée, Belle, to leave him, which further hardens his heart. The untimely death of his sister Fan, the one relative who had a close relationship with him, also injures him greatly enough that he loses any love he had for the world.

ceBTTCPwaa	"The Lady or the Tiger?" is a famous short story written by Frank R. Stockton in 1882. Stockton later wrote a continuation of this story, "The Discourager of Hesitancy".<br>  <br>  The semi-barbaric King of an ancient land utilized an unusual form of administering justice for offenders in his kingdom. The offender would be placed in an arena where his only way out would be to go through one of two doors. Behind one door was a beautiful woman hand-picked by the king and behind the other was a fierce tiger. The offender was then asked to pick one of the doors, without knowing what was behind it. If he picked the door with the woman behind it, then he was declared innocent but was also required to marry the woman, regardless of previous marital status. If he picked the door with the tiger behind it, though, then he was deemed guilty and the tiger would rip him to pieces.<br>  <br>  One day the king found that his daughter, the princess, had taken a lover far beneath her station. The king could not allow this and so he threw the offender in prison and set a date for his trial in the arena. On the day of his trial the suitor looked to the princess for some indication of which door to pick. The princess, did, in fact, know which door concealed the woman and which one the tiger, but was faced with a conundrum. If she indicated the door with the tiger, then the man she loved would be killed on the spot; however, if she indicated the door with the lady, her lover would be forced to marry another woman and even though he would be alive she would never be with him again. Finally she does indicate a door, which the suitor then opens.<br>  <br>  At this point the question is posed to the reader, "Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady?". The question is not answered, and is left as a thought experiment regarding human nature.<br>  <br>  From its publication and surprise ending, "The Lady, or the Tiger?" has come into the English language as an expression, meaning an unsolvable problem.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Lady%2C_or_the_Tiger%3F" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Lady%2C_or_t...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/3499/discourager.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/3...</a>|`|uin3ffWDaa	no i think it is pointless and does not deter crime. what a funny story. and for the record i think he defiantly got the tiger.|`|zWjdfB5Oaa	I think it was.It actually depended on what the defendant did,if they've done something wrong,like murder,then it would've been unfair if he got the lady.<br>  the king was a very strict man.

Now, imagine Abraham Lincoln, the legendary President of the United States, brought to Jesus by a seamstress. But maybe that's not such a surprise. See, when someone serves you, they have a unique, non-threatening, trusted position in your life - perhaps the most powerful position in the world for real.<br>  <br>  Which leads us to our word for today from the Word of God in 2 Kings 5, beginning at verse 1. We're talking about Naaman, a great military commander of Syria, but it says he was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy. Bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman's wife. She said to her mistress, "If only my master would see the prophet who was in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy" (vs. 3). As it turns out, he does go to the prophet, and his leprosy is healed.<br>  <br>  Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl had said. And the king said, "By all means go" (vs. 5). So he goes out and finally gets his cure. Here's the most powerful military figure maybe in that part of the world, being told where the answer is by a little Jewish servant girl. But he listened, just like Lincoln did. Now there's an important and encouraging secret here. If you're going to be in a position to get through to someone spiritually, be their servant. Being a servant to someone is the most powerful position in the world.|`|rKLLsof1aa	Population wise:-<br>  1.Jesus<br>  2.Hazrat Mohammad<br>  3.Brambha<br>  4.Buddha<br>  5.Mahabir

V2EtdpKMaa	lol, I thought you would get more response than this.  Ok, here we go.  First, the writing, taken sentence by sentence is good.  I think there are some story problems that you need to fix.  You need to decide what the purpose of this scene is and how it's going to fit with the rest. Written as it is with no point of view character it might work as a prologue if you ended it here and started chapter one clearly in some character's POV.  You get plenty of suspense in early which is good.  You don't want your reader thinking about nonessential issues like how a guy standing out in a torrential rain is managing to smoke a cigarette.  Either put him under some shelter or cut "cigarette" at the beginnnig of the sentence and end it something like "...countryside as he cupped his cigarette in his hand to protect if from the water falling."  Another one is that we are on the roof at this point and even if we can hear the cello playing, we can't see who's playing it. You can't fix that by putting us in the man's POV unless you stay there and end this with him dying and don't show us anything about the killer.     Apparently, the people who are going to find the body know the man so it might be useful to name him somewhere in this part--maybe when they find him?      "So the people all decided to abandon their tasks and find the source of the peculiar sound, but what they found would bring them no solace." This sentence is grammatically correct but overwritten. Stay in a voice that people use.  Same problem with "pandeonium enveloped" plus you probably meant "developed" there.  I can't see "enveloped"     If a scream is what everyone heard, then then next scene needs to start dealing with the question of why they would hear that but not the shot.  You don't need to resolve that but when they find he's been shot they need to wonder about it.     Last thing for now.  You can't tell the difference between one of these kinds of smoke and the other.  It's a nicely written image but as a practical matter won't work.  What might work would be "the smell of cordite" or "gunpowder"     I think you might be better off just to push ahead and try to finish the story then come back and try to figure these things out.
67f7a9562eea0008ccdd2892a04062f7aa	I am going to dispel all the politcal mis-information and garbage about the War for Southern Independence (the real name). At the risk of shocking a lot of people, here it is......    There is no 'treaty' that ended the War. In fact, the War never officially ended. The South just quit fighting. Jefferson Davis never surrendered the Confederacy, nor was it ever dissolved by the Confederate Congress (the only legal body with the power to do so). All the Confederate military units never surrendered. They just broke up and went home, to endure the enemy occupation, known as 'Reconstruction'.    Not only that, Jefferson Davis was never charged with any crimes in US Court (because it would've called into question the legality of the War itself), and was held illegally for 2 years in a federal prison, while the US Administration tried to find a graceful way out of the situation, that would not involve the Courts. They finally just ignored the whole thing, hoping that the world would stay focused on 'Reconstruction'.    And, secession has still never been ruled illegal, because it can't be...without scrapping the entire US Constitution. Many so called 'scholars' like to quote the 1869 SCOTUS case of Texas v White, but that case did not rule secession illegal. It ruled that Texas was a state, and not an occupied territory, therefore Whites cause of action against the state was  valid. It is a prime example of the Government wanting it both ways.    There is no existing document that legally ended the War for Southern Independence, or disolved the Confederacy.    If anyone comes up with one, I'd really like to see it.|`|xQwU590Laa	There was no treaty.  After Lee signed the surrender papers for the Army of Virginia, the remaining forces were either chased down or surrendered on their own.  The Confederate government fled, and were picked up piecemeal by the Union army.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	There could not be a treaty, because a treaty would establish the legal right of the South to secede.

TZ4MQHDcaa	The housecarls were the closest thing to a standing army that the English monarch had before the arrival of the Normans.  The housecarls were a ferocious, well trained force; their most well known idiosyncrasy being their use of the great double-handed battle-axe (this was the height of a man and was wielded with two hands, swung around the head). It was said that a housecarl could decapitate a horse with a single blow of his axe. This is probably an exaggeration, but you have to agree it gives an awesome reputation.  The most famous use of the housecarls, of course, was at the Battle of Hastings, where they formed the front line, resisting Norman attack by means of their 'shield wall'. If all of Harold's English forces were as disciplined as the housecarls, the result of the battle might well have been different. However, the indisciplined fyrd (militia) contributed to Harold's losing the battle.  So, there's your answer. They were the English monarch's bodyguard up to late-1066.|`|xQwU590Laa	They were special leading knights, who used a two handed battle axe in battle.|`|G2JHunHjaa	A member of the highly trained military bodyguard kept by the Danish kings of England from 1016. They were part of the royal household and were paid out of the Heregeld (a tax initially levied by Cnut in 1013 for the upkeep of his bodyguard).|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Indoor servants|`|AA11942204	They were the king's household troops, his bodyguards, the chief amongst his warriors|`|6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	In addition to the warriors owing service in respect of their land, the eleventh century fyrd contained other types of warriors. A more ancient element within the fyrd, the king's personal entourage, retained its importance throughout the period. The huscarles of Cnut and the later Saxon kings represented the last elements of the earlier class of gesieas. They formed a group of professional warriors in the direct service of the king, living in his hall and receiving gifts from the king in return for their service. They accompanied the king on journeys, served as ministers in peacetime and formed his bodyguard and the backbone of his royal host in times of war. Although often seen as mercenaries, because they received payment from the king, their service arose from the obligation to serve their lord rather than just a cash inducement. The body of royal huscarles is said to have numbered 3,000 by 1066, and it seems that by this date many of the other great lords also had their own huscarles, sometimes numbering into the hundreds.    It appears that generally the huscarles were even more heavily equipped than the thegns. In addition to the equipment associated with a normal fyrdman, at least at the time of Cnut they were expected to own 'splendid armour,' including a double-edged sword with a gold inlaid hilt and a 'massive and bloodthirsty two-handed axe,' this latter weapon having been introduced into England in the course of the Viking attacks at the end of the tenth century.|`|09YWnp8paa	Some of the answers have given you some good pointers here...but you might be interested to know that Huscarles also formed the main force of Viking armies and were almost identical to the Saxons in the way they fought. This was the so-called 'shield wall', where men would interlock their shields and form an unbreakable barrier against which the enemy would throw themselves with very little success. This happened at Hastings. If the shield wall had remained intact, William may well have lost. But, importantly, it was not the Huscarles who broke, but the Fyrrd. The Huscarles died to a man at Hastings. Harold was a Huscarle and was a formidable warrior. In the Bayeux Tapestry you can see images of the Huscarles cleaving men and horses in two, so their reputation was probably justified. They also used kite shields and were dressed almost identically to the Norman knights, many of whom fought on foot. Very confusing in the heat of battle. They were tough and well trained and formed the centre of Harold's army. They wielded great battle-axes (which didn't have such a large head and so could be swung repeatedly), but their most prized weapon was the sword, which was often passed down from father to son. They were the finest troops of their day.Only thing was, at Hastings,there weren't enough of them!

tKWwZpOAaa	you need something that you can control the shutter speed and can shoot at several frames per second. So prbably a DSLR which you can get used for a couple hundred on ebay.    To do it set the shutter speed to something like 1/1000 and have someone take a series of shots while you fire. Might take a few trys to get it right, but this is the only way i can think to do it.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	Shots like this are not shot using the mechanical shutter which is way too slow, they are shot in a totally dark room, with the camera shutter open and uses a flash for the exposure. Any camera with 'B' mode can be used for this. 'B' Mode is where the shutter stays open all the time the shutter button is pressed.    This, needless to say, is pretty risky - bordering on idiocy!!!!    There are several ways of triggering the flash, one is to use a microphone amplifier/delay circuit that detects the explosion and the circuit can alter the fraction of a seconds delay to trigger the flash (even a bullet takes time to travel just the length of the barrel).    Another way is to have two bare wires attached to the back of a target card, the two wires are wired to the the trigger circuit of the flash and the bullet makes the circuit. The only problem is you can't see the target (totally dark room) so for this the gun is mounted in a clamp.

Anything, really =D|`|oHmSa4zbaa	sign up if you get scared try not to make eye contact with the auddance|`|A72rLndeaa	if you are worried about the audience laughing at you try recording your voice and listening to it,  if your happy with it then the audience will be as well    if its just stage fright then don't make eye contact with the audience or ask one of your friends to come on with you and do a duet, you can try to get a friend that isn't as good as you,   it makes you look better :)    and keep thinking confident thoughts like 'they are going to love me' or 'im gonna blow them away'    and if worst comes to worst keep a lucky charm or something really special to you at hand, it really helped me when my band played in the school talent show, guess what, we won! :)|`|xLj4nilXaa	Well I'd advise you to choose a song that you know that you're good at and comfortable singing. Then when your on stage, just pretend that there's no one there, and you'll believe it. Look straight to the back of the room and keep focus on something.     Just go out there and have fun with it! :)

j5Apt8hWaa	Having only attend the US Army photo classes and at any given time we had Air Force, Navy and Marines in our classes, it would be difficult to know for sure.    See if you can get a syllabus of each course and then run it by an instructor at your community college    Basic photography will be taught the same ... whether or not they teach you how to use all the cameras you will run into while serving is an other question all together.    The Army did that.  We used all the different brands that were in the inventory and some that they were testing for adoption if successful.  At the time we were using primarily Leica and Nikon cameras.  But we also had specialty cameras like an IR Pentax, briefcase Canon copy camera, an old Minox and others.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Having served 6 years in the US Air Force Security Police and then another 6 years in the US Army Medical Corps I would BET you would be happier in the US Air Force. You'll get an opportunity to take photos of aircraft in flight as well as work for Air Force publications such as Airman magazine and other projects.    They are also difficult to get into. You have to have reallllly good talent, good vision and no color blindness. You also have to score high on the ASVAB tests. They used to ask for a portfolio of your photography projects, but don't do so anymore. All branches get the same basic training at the same military base.....which used to be Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, I believe. I think the Photo Journalism training last about 8 weeks. It includes writing skills and photography.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	If you're on a ship, you'll see more naturally stopping at various ports depending on which ship you are assigned to.  Though not everyone in the navy works the ships, so you could be potentially land locked as you are in the air force.    I served in the airforce, and my father before me.  The potential to travel is as small/large as you make it.  I know people that don't leave the CONUS (continental us), and then there are people like me that traveled around the world because I put in for all those assignments every time they came up.      Both will give you great opportunity.  If you know you're going to go into the service, you might want to consider more what it is you want to do.  Some people go in think, I don't care what I do, and then they're cooks or work at the morgue for 2-6 years and hate life.    If you do the airforce I've gone some suggestions for you with huge travel opportunities that wouldn't require much volunteering or effort.    CE - civil engineering, particular with the Red Horse Squadrons  Air Crew - there are a lot of air crew positions available, and since you'll be assigned to a plane,  you go wherever it goes.  Intel - though most of their HQs are in the US you will get a lot of chances to go everywhere.  Aerial Gunner - like aircrew you go to where the action is and have the potential to do some serious traveling.    There are a lot more, but those are sticking out in the fore front.  The potential to travel is really there in any branch.  Having lived and served the airforce life for much of my life, I'm partial to the air force.  But you really can't go wrong with either.    *cough*  Go air force!
UsTyc0oeaa	Absolutely not!  Any reputable agent will only get paid when YOU get paid, and then, only a fair and ethical percentage of it.    Any person or any agency that requests money up front is trying to scam you.  Run away and run away fast from anyone who claims that they will get you work, but only AFTER you pay.  It's a lie.    There are MANY scam agencies out there  Be careful, ask for references of current clients, and ask those clients if they are satisfied.  Keep in mind that other people who may be trying to get gigs may see you as competition, and therefore may try to mislead you.|`|js2TUHFdaa	no, and if they request money, it's a scam.

If you have someone in that area who can go through the newspapers on microfilm that would probably be at a library, but that takes a lot of time and it's easy to miss what you're looking for.      The message board on Ancestry . com is a shot.  You might run into someone who has those people in their tree or has run into them.  I've had a lot of luck finding people that way.

Kjn89JaQaa	So far two people here have put there answer, thanks both for helping you. Here is some thing from my desk, it may help you out to find your sister. <br>  <br>   It is required to know about your country. If you are from US then the chance of getting your sister will be fine and it will easy to locate her with out much more struggle. You may try yourself with the advancement of technology. Like FREE and Paid People search service. They maintain a large data base of people with Phone Number, SSN no. Email adddress. They also update their result regularly.<br>  <br>  You might have tried with Google search engine and if not try with social networking sites. But getting the exact result for finding one person from social networking site is not most of the time accurate. It is trouble some also.<br>  <br>  So better go for some People Search Engine site. I know one which ask no money.That is <a href="http://america-people-search.ws" rel="nofollow">http://america-people-search.ws</a> This is free and instant people search data provider. All the access are free of charge. To unlock some result you may have to give your email address to register for free. This service is provided for searching American all over the states.<br>  <br>  Wish that you will get your sister soon. May God bless you.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	www.zabasearch.com is one free search engine, but it applies only to the US. <br>  Google is free as well. <br>  None of them (or anything) guarantees that you can find anyone. Everything depends on country and circumstance.|`|RwXTJiTMaa	You need to post a little more information. If you know the city where your sister lives, you can call 411 and ask for her by name and city.<br>  <br>  If not, it's going to be hard -- especially if she has a relatively common name. As silly as it sounds, your first and best bet is to type her full name into google with quotes around it -- include her middle name or any titles that might apply.<br>  <br>  If you know nothing about her -- if you don't know her last name, or any general area where she lives, or if she's underage you will probably not be able to find her without paying for an investigator to help you.
d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Wilson certainly didn't help matters. By nature he was combative and unlikely to compromise.<br>  <br>  Instead of attempting to cut a deal with his staunchest critic, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) Wilson thumbed his nose at Lodge by delivering his first speech advocating the League of Nations in Lodge's hometown of Boston.<br>  <br>  Lodge was a very conservative Isolationist, and took the snub personally. That he was also Chairman of the Committee that would either kill or recommend passage of Wilson's beloved treaty was something Wilson didn't consider.<br>  <br>  Was Wilson responsible for the failure? Yes and no. His obstreperous attitude certainly didn't help. But the fact is, he was simply right at the wrong time in history. American participation in WW I represented an aberration. In 1920, the American people simply weren't ready to think of themselves as being part of a larger world. And it's unlikely Wilson or anyone else could have changed the zeitgeist of the post war years.|`|qgs155HNaa	In addition to what Jack said,  when Wilson went to Paris to negotiate the peace, he did not choose to take any Republicans with him, even though the Republicans had won control of both houses of Congress in the 1916 election.  He wrote books on American History and the American Constitution, and he should have known he would need their cooperation in the Senate to ratify the Treaty.|`|d88ef8f1c01d01e57c385835f3395a78aa	Gadds - - - - Someone (Jack) actually gave you an intelligent answer. Wow!!<br>  <br>  For some odd reason despite being a Democrat, Woodrow Wilson has been Sanctified - - - made into this Deity of Peace - - - an Apostle of Democracy whose Reputation is Sacrosanct - - - to do otherwise is to enrage teachers.<br>  <br>  I do not envy you the task at hand.<br>  <br>  How to speak to WIlson ?   Bear in mind that Wilson was first & foremost a School Professor, a University Dean, the Head Honcho on Campus.  That translates into being deferential to the point of dropping on your knees & licking cow crusties off of his patent leather shoes!  One one address him as "Sir," and ask 'leading' questions allowing Wilson to scornfully 'correct you,' and then to show off his superiority in a haughty high falutin' manner.  <br>  <br>  Yes Wilson was responsible for its failure but Heck, the Treaty was a piece of sh^t and the Laugue of Nations was not much better.  It was right for the US to fail to ratify the treaty.  Lodge was right, Wilson was wrong but as JACK said, it was WIlson's complete utter lack of tact that caused its failure.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Peace/\/\/\/

JOChNigNaa	Basically good, try lit instead of burn. L4, S1 seems stilted, is there another way you can say that? L2 is awkward and head and bled seem to be the culprits.

Flames are doused with water.  If a dorsimbra is a contrast of opposites linked,  the torch may have been lit and doused by the storms of contention.

snrdDbLAaa	This poem has much appeal, and is a response which Whitman's tasteless sally hardly merits.  The veery, which frames the poem in the first and last stanzas, contributes a distinctly American flavour; but combined with the mournful rendition of the myth of Phaeton, I am also drawn in to the atmosphere of the Ode to a Nightingale.  Perhaps the meditations on Time which suffuse your other works, so much less bellicose than Shakespeare's, also contribute to how I read your telling of this story.<br>  <br>  I am fascinated by how this poem has tamed ottava rima by engulphing the couplet; the tone, which is by turns contemplative and playful, never degenerates into the Byronic.  Yet, it is easier to credit the sincerity of the last stanza's adumbration of Riemannian geometry, than the free punning and obstreperous rhymes particularly of the third stanza.  The natural desire to implicate the upper brain, and thereby invoke the pons, seems to result in an oddly comical celesto-biological interlude, which effect is much heightened by the serial miscegenation of metaphors in, `a tempest brewing in my pons...;' yet, I enjoyed the connexion of `tide' and sz. 2 with `perilune' in sz. 3.  <br>  <br>  My difficulty with the two middle stanzas is the gradual transition from the very sensual, which was perfectly modulated in sz. 1, and which surfaces in the last lines of sz. 2, to the narrative mode most prominent in sz. 3 that uses metaphor to convey the speaker's intellectual life.  I think the transition is somewhat clumsy, while sz. 3 does not for me capture intellectual joy in the genuine way `language of the recondite' does, despite the obscurity (in places) of the fourth stanza.<br>  <br>  Please don't suppose that I, by penning criticisms describing my reception of the poem, imagine myself better able to succeed.  I write only as a critic, while, certainly, my own attempts at versical ramblings on this site have enjoyed uniformity only in being ungainly and fault-ridden without exception.  Allow me to commend your verse, which superlatively inhabits the elegant realm between phrase-stopped uniformity and enjambed garrulousness.<br>  <br>  To answer the question of the title, in my experience and belief, I suspect I cannot be analytical and at once live in the moment, if these terms are understood in the common way.  Spinoza wrote that the world of forms and the world of Platonic shadows are but two of many suburbs in the mind of God; perhaps this disjunction is the reason there sometimes seems to be no `pons' between them.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Mr Typewriter,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your kind reply; I am pleased to make your acquaintance.<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Hypocorism

RZQHB0g8aa	I really like the idea of the story and it's easy to read! i'd love to know how it goes on. I agree with the one above me though... it is a bit rushed. I mean the whole process of realizing that you are not human and saying goodbye to the people who you believed to be your parents for fourteen years... that's not an easy thing and i think you should put in some more thoughts and emotions of Ebony. And also the school part passes a bit too quickly and it becomes kind of obvious that this "surprise" will change Ebony's life because you say "it's all she could think about" or something like that. From that moment on it was already clear to me that someone was gonna tell her she's different (maybe because I read too much fantasy). I think you should make her forget about it until she comes home or her not thinking about what it could be because she knows it will be some awful idea. And i didn't quite get how she feels about her "parents". Does she like them despite the fact that they are a bit annoying sometimes?<br>  Hope this helps! And keep writing!|`|MXhFrLFvaa	you need to slow down and introduce the character a bit more before your start the plot, we don't know who she is! Chopping the events into chapters or taking us through a fairly detailed day of school for her might be a start, then we can see how normal/lonely her life is before its turned upside down, so its more dramatic! Hopefully thats what your aiming for, it sounds like a good idea though, i would definetly read it if it was published! however a different name for 'unseelie'? or capitalise it, like 'England'.<br>  Keep going!!|`|kAqjxDHaaa	It's not bad at all. It is a little bit rushed, though. Slow down, and describe things in more detail; give the reader a picture in their minds. What does her bedroom look like? What do her 'parents' look like?

NjBt73f2aa	I'm published, but finding an agent came as sheer luck to me. I entered a contest on a whim and happened to win. That brought in a lot of interest from various agents and publishers, which led to my first book being published. <br>  <br>  Usually, though, it does take a lot of time. Depending on just how great your writing skills are, it could take years. I'd say finding an agent is usually the easiest part. The best way to go is to make sure your book is absolutely finished to the best of your ability before sending it to ANYONE. Then, send it to as many addresses as possible, including a lot of the lesser known companies. Those are usually your best chances as they're more desperate to turn out hits and best sellers. <br>  <br>  After you've secured an agent, it could take a year or two, or possibly even more, to nail down a publishing contract. It's up to your agent to advertise your book as much as possible and try to find the best fit for it and you. This is what they're paid to do, so it's best to leave this part up to them. This means you'll probably be waiting in silence for great periods of time, only recieving minor updates from your agent from time to time.<br>  <br>  Once you have a contract, it takes a good while to edit the novel and make it 100% ready to publish. This takes a lot of rewriting and reworking. In fact, some publishing deals come with complete revisions that can sometimes change your story entirely (make sure to not get sucked into one of these unless you're willing to compromise your story). Once all the editing and revisions are done, it should be pretty smooth sailing from there.<br>  <br>  Anyway, in most cases, this process takes 2 to 5 years. And that's to say if everything goes according to plan. But if you're determined enough and talented enough, you probably won't mind the lengthy process. And, I must say, it's definitely worth it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! :)|`|9Yfb7DHXaa	No, but I want to be.|`|OEjTgOuUaa	It took me a year and 24 queries to find an agent. However, after a year, when he had been unable to sell my book, we parted company. I still have no agent.<br>  <br>  However, I sold my debut novel to the very first editor I queried. This was actually the third book I'd written since seriously starting to pursue publication. It was almost four years since I starting writing the first book until I made my first sale. It took another thirteen months for my first book to actually be released (this is pretty average).<br>  <br>  As I said, I still do not have an agent, but my editor recently offered to publish two more books from me, and yes, I negotiated my own contract. My second book is scheduled for release in Sept. My third book (as yet unwritten) has a Spring 2010 tentative release date.<br>  <br>  I know writers who have written more than a dozen books and/or have been writing for over twenty years before they sold. Publishing is truly an unpredictable business.

d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	I was on your side until you threw in 'magic'.  I thought this was Science Fiction or speculative fiction?  And your story seemed like it had a great Sci-Fi premise.  I thought the musical 'texts' he was studying would somehow reveal a scientific equation that would lead him to discovering that the skreddlers performed at a certain pitch and frequency or perhaps if enough of them were restructured they would make a tool of some kind that in essence could do something that could halt this end of the world thing...

BpcAVgEeaa	Dude, I am so sorry this happened to you. Save her while you still can!<br>  <br>  Honestly, I wish everyone could use your mentality on deciphering the true reason everyone is crazy about Twilight. Everything you said was spot-on. The writing is terrible, the characters and plot are boring and the author didn't do any research on anything. My theory as to why people are obsessed is that they are either desperate, unhealthily obsessive because of their raging preteen hormones, or they have never read a book in their life prior to Twilight. Now, I doubt your wife falls into any of these categories, she sounds like she just likes supernatural/fantasy books. Nothing wrong with that. Just make sure she moves on from Twilight to other books :)|`|BzMQejGxaa	There are some sane teenagers, thank god.<br>  <br>  It just seems like some housewife's desperate fantasy, trying to convince us that we all want this pathetic 'romance'. I felt like a voyeur reading parts of it.|`|2wRWkjIlaa	I think it's the idea of young love... I've read the Twilight series and I found it a really quick read and yes, the person above is right, we DO like to pretend we're Bella because Edward IS hot. haha. Well teenage girls get REALLY into books like this when they read them. Like in New Moon when Edward left, I threw the book at the wall... I have no idea why, and I feel like a crazy person, but I did it... it was just a reaction I had... and when the series ended I cried, again I don't know why, it just happened....<br>  All in all, Twilight IS NOT the best written book in the world, but Meyer did have a good plot, I think that the book was a lot better befor EVERYONE started becoming obsessive with it... but hey, I'm happy for the author because she's bringing in millions now...<br>  It's an interesting book to read, and girls like it because of Edward, and I think that's the overall appeal to it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  Pleaseandthanks<3<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219173251AABdOXy&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|AA10015648	I don't personally like it, but I can understand the psychology behind why girls do like it.<br>  <br>  It's a story of forbidden love, of a man who loves a girl beyond rational capacity (which is how a women yearns to imagine a guy would love her), of a girl who "got the guy" that everyone thought was un-gettable, and Bella's feeling of "completeness" that everyone in life wants to feel.<br>  <br>  I mean, every girl knows what it's like to go to a concert or see a celebrity and think "if only he chose me, out of all these other people, to really 'know' him." Women have a VERY deep-rooted yearning to be noticed, to be seen as uniquely beautiful and worthy of special attention. Special, amazingly hot guy gives clumsy girl special attention? That speaks to girls at a very deep level, no matter how poorly written it is.|`|SFxQyTfJaa	I like your question. ^^<br>  <br>  I also wondered about the why-does-Edward-loves-Bella-thing...<br>  --and I think he's attracted to her 1. because of her blood and ". because he can'ts read her mind... but yea, I think this reasons aren't good enough to fall in love with somebody are even to marry! so I think there's no real reason why he loves her. Stephanie Meyer couldn't create a better character then Bella to love...<br>  --yes, I think Bella just fawn about him because he looks great AND pay attention to her.<br>  --No, i didn't get tied of it in the beginning, I like to imagine a good looking person ^^ but during the series it really gets annoying and it seems that Bella just loves him because of his appearance bec ause she always talks about how he look and never what a good personality he has...<br>  <br>  oh, I think I've answerd some of my question as well ;D|`|AVYBazOEaa	I was at first;- The novelty has worn off.<br>  The only thing I still adore is Rob x<br>  He's such a hottie (: x|`|4Ql5vKfraa	it's a lot do do with the way he touches her, like the "sexual tension" apparently ... <br>  remember, as a vampire, he is supposed to attract his prey. being gorgeous helps him along with that lol<br>  when i first read it i was like, obsessed with it, because SM painted the perfect picture of the guy we all want, breathtakingly gorgeous with a hot body and good manners who wants them, the plain klutzy girl. add the special "powers" and it was like, exciting, he was dangerous, yet at the same time very very protective.<br>  <br>  then i sort of came to my senses after reading the 4th book. the only thing which sets it apart is the fact that it was the first book which somehow became ridiculously popular.<br>  <br>  if you look at it, they're not vampires, they're people who sparkle in the sun with superhuman strength and are on a animal blood diet.<br>  <br>  it's like a fairytale with enough danger to excite young women, but not enough to have a proper lasting effect, if that makes any sense.<br>  <br>  bella was created as a shell, SM all but admitted it on her own website, a character which the reader could easily step into.<br>  <br>  it's like being a kid and getting a huge, sparkly toy; you're obsessed with it at the start, then the novelty wears off and you realise it's actually rubbish.<br>  well that's what it was like for me :)|`|C2FkuVESaa	Answering your questions in order:<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Because she's an everygirl- kinda plain, kinda stupid, kinda clumsy, like most females out there. Because the handsome, intelligent, mysterious stranger falling in love with the abovementioned female is what most girls dream of.<br>  <br>  2. Frankly, I attribute it to stupidity. I think it's just part of the story: there's no rationale, just what Meyer's little mind pretends romance should be. When girls are desperate (as Bella is, obviously) anything works, and clingy is the name of the game<br>  <br>  3. See 1 and 2. He's idealized (despite the creepy factor) and made into this supposedly perfect boyfriend. Also, we can presume in her loneliness, Bella hasn't had much experience with guys, so one looker's  something to latch onto and gush about. <br>  <br>  4. I hate to say this, but it's very mormonistic, which is what Meyer is. It idealizes the Mormon marriage in the way that their relationship is set up. There's actually a lot of Mormon propaganda in that book. Submitting completely to one's husband and becoming part and parcel of him- just look at it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just remember: this is a lonely housewife's wet dream, and relies a lot on sexual tension. It also bases on TWOO WUV (which means fangirls presume needs no explanation) and happily-ever-after. There is no real plot, just four books of angsty whining. In the end, nothing bad happens and all live happily ever after. The writing alone is enough to make most critical readers turn away. You can't look at it logically; to do so shows the book for what it is: badly written tripe on paper. While I'll never encourage anyone to read it, I will say to those who do: go in reading like a six-year-old, otherwise you're gonna have a lot of problems if you're trained to read.|`|PsarWirtaa	people get get sucked in because it's what they like.<br>  in my case i already liked vampires but now i'm obsessed! but the book is a romance so that's why girls go for it more than boys!<br>  plus i would like to read lord of the rings but can't find the first one!<br>  <br>  *Team Emmett & Jasper*|`|V0iGdZDSaa	I think that the appeal is that it is a whole different world. that you know its not real yet you sometimes wish that you get lost in that sort of fantasy. and how unrealistic edward is. how almost every girl wants a man like that. and sure we don't need one but it would be nice. it is just a whole place that you can read about and escape your real world for a change. i think it's fun and exciting to think, well what if that could happen to me or what if that was real. i hope that helped. :)|`|cxd2kSaSaa	Twilight is hugely unrealistic. I'm a 16 year old girl, and I even I can see how transparent the book is. The characters are either self loving or self loathing - hardly the appropriate example for teenage girls. Girls I know love the books because they wish they were Bella. They wish they could experience the 'love' her and Edward have - even though, to me, their love just seems childish and immature. They see Bella as this ordinary, every day girl (much like themselves), and hope that one day they can find their 'own' Edward Cullen, who is portrayed as this god like creature.  <br>  <br>  They have yet to experience proper literacy novels, and therefore see Twilight as hugely original and creative. Whereas, realistically, there have been so many similar versions of the book in the past. <br>  <br>  I find the twilight books, especially New Moon, such bad examples to girls. Bella is a needy girl who has no Independence whatsoever, and therefore makes girls believe that you need a man to make you happy. Like you said, she needs Edward to live her life for her. Many teenagers may find this hugely romantic and appealing, but I just find it desperate and pretty pathetic. <br>  <br>  I just think that there are so many good novels out there that don't get the same publicity as Twilight, even though they are so much better. <br>  <br>  And I agree with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I couldn't put the books down, but with Twilight, I struggled to finish them.|`|hGVkInSnaa	I've read the whole series and I thought that it was just okay. I definitely have no plas to read it again. I guess all the little teenage girls like it so much because they think Edward is hot and totally pretend that they're Bella when they read the books, or something like that.|`|hKOrfJgPaa	The books r so mostly popular among the girls cz of many reasons. firstly its romantic so it appeals vry much to the girls. secondly edward is like this perfect boyfriend everybody wants. the magical concept and everything from vampires to magic to emotion sets it apart! You should try reading it without getting to much into the logic and your gonna love it but not as much as girls do ofcourse..|`|YorMkZYAaa	I've yet to understand this as well my friend. I think the simplicity of it coupled with the romance involved between the two main characters allows [mostly] young girls to have something to escape into. I could never get into it and think it is pure rubbish. <br>  <br>  It's fine for escapism but there are too many out there who get way too involved with it and think that it is the be all and end all to good books. And I chuckle at anyone who says it is "the best book ever" simply because it just isn't.

Because musicians are like Artists who translate and interpret inner thoughts and visions down. A musician must be like a thermometer who takes the temperature of the atmosphere and adjust themselves to that atmospshere of their surroundings.<br>  <br>  Music is very, very spiritual so that aspect comes into play with a heightened sense of awareness & depth, depending on how perceptive the musician is. Some musicians are much deeper than others and some others have no idea what they are doing musically so they fail a lot to reach their potential.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	it is more emotional as the top poster suggests.

I feel that I am a little of both, however, I probably listen more than some since I have a much greater background that I have nurtured in as both a listener and a musician.  Many musicians, to me, seem to relate to music more visually, in a sense, and have not fully developed their potential to listen.<br>  <br>  When I open myself up to the visual world, it is amazing what I see. I often translate what I see to what I hear inside of me.  It is a powerful combination, as a musician, to not only listen fully, but to see fully.<br>  <br>  "Seeing" is not only what you see with your eyes, but also what you see with your third eye.

If the answer to that question is yes then read on. <br>  There are many universities in England which allow you to study drama, you can study it with other subjects such as english literature so that you have a wider range of jobs that you'll be able to apply for once you graduate. If you're really serious about acting and you can see yourself doing it for many years, and do not have any other career in mind then you might want to think about applying for a big name drama school such as RADA , the guildhall school of acting or Mountview academy of theatre arts. They will ask you to go for an audition and an interview, so be prepared.<br>  Also you have to ask yourself what aspect of acting you're interested in, would you like to appear in films, on the stage or on the television.<br>  Also, have you any experience, ever been to an audition before? been involved in any production (however small), part of a drama group? All of these things on your CV will impress the drama schools.<br>  Also the names i have given you are very big drama schools, so don't put alll your eggs into one basket,<br>  good luck, and i hope i helped!|`|HosJ3bNgaa	you dont have to just study drama you could also go to drama school|`|lkNJNnlSaa	A scientist, an engineer, an economist and a drama graduate are at the table of the restaurant.

Certainly the 1.5 million Irish who starved to death -- and also died of exposure (they were thrown out into the nearest ditch when they could not pay their "rent") were the result of total indifference by the ruling British.  In my view, indifference is even worse than planned genocide! They were not even important enough to think about.  But it may have also been planned.  As for the native Americans, THIS was most assuredly genocide!  "The only good Indian is a dead Indian."  This was not just an amusing retort!  The methods used were countless.... but one stands out as having no shadow of a doubt, the slaughter of the bison in order to starve into submission all those who depended on them for EVERYTHING.  Simply shooting "them there Indians" was also considered a sport.  (Not unknown as regards the aborigines in Australia, either.)

fI4LqMVMaa	I don't particularly enjoy the story, but I do see why other's like it.  It's an easy, uncomplicated read, teens can identify with it, the storyline is simple enough for anyone to understand, and all of the girls want a romance like bella and edward's.  Their fantasies are lived out in the pages of the book: in their minds, edward is an unbelivably strong, handsome, loving, protective, and superhuman boyfriend who will heighten every experience.  And, he will love bella forever because he's immortal.  What we see as stalkerish qualities they see as a caring, loving guy who will protect his girlfriend from harm.  What we see as stifling protectivness and jelousy, they see as love.  True, it's highly unrealistic, but the readers are people who don't have a lot of life experience and don't really know what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like.  Additionally, they have trouble recognizing the inferior quality of the writing because A. many of them haven't read very many other books and B. they don't want anyone to crush their fantasies that are given life in the book, and will thus ignore any true criticism of the book.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, it's popular because it's hit a niche market - prepubescent and just-about-pubescent girls who really, really want to think they are mature and fantasise about true love all the time...but aren't close to ready to read about real relationships yet. It's written the way 12 year olds think. Trust me - I have a 12 year old daughter - and yes, to kids that age, "Because *character* is HAWT!!!!11one!!1" is a real reason. They're only kids. Thats how they think relationships _are_.<br>  <br>  My only surprise is that it has any readers at all over the age of 14.|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	Hormones.|`|BpcAVgEeaa	They are being terribly mislead into thinking that is what true love is, when in fact it is nothing but lust.

What girl doesn't like that.  and every girl wants someone to care about her and protect her like edward does even if she doesn't really need it.  Personally after i thought about it i think that is a little overprotective and a little creepy, i wouldn't want anyone who was like the Edward character.  It is an easy read book  so if people are not readers and they don't read often then they read this and think that it is the best writing ever because they have nothing to compare it to. That is what i think, if it makes any sense|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Because they don't read. These are not intelligent, literary people, they haven't read much, this is the first book that has come along that is simple enough for them to get through, and it's written like a wet dream, practically. Bella is a Mary-Sue, it is easy for girls to put themselves in her place, so they are drawn in by it. If Bella doesn't care that Edward is abusive, the fangirls don't care either. And they can't tell that the writing is shoddy, because they don't have the experience with good writing.<br>  <br>  Short answer: It's easy, it's fun, they don't have to think, and it makes them feel special.|`|hGVkInSnaa	Because the people that like Twilight are too stupid to learn how to read proper books.|`|6QDaqIXbaa	I completely agree with you, however I will tell you why it is so popular:<br>  Stephanie Myer is a frustrated, bored, desperate and horny housewife and this book is just the fantasies she has compiled from her own wet-dreams. <br>  This is why it is so popular with single and unhappy-in-marriage women over 30.<br>  The reason it's so popular with teenagers is because<br>  A) they have never experienced real love, only infatuation which is why they can connect  with the main protagonist when she explains the reason she loves Edward is because he's hot.<br>  B) they havn't experienced enough life to forge their own personality which is why they can connect with the main protagonist who is seen as a faceless, nameless, boring and pathetic person who doesn;t have a personality of her own.<br>  C) they havn't experienced or heard about domestic violence so they see the way Edward treats the main protagonist as 'romantic when really is it chauvinistic and anti-feminist. <br>  <br>  One more reason that explains how both older and younger women are infatuated with the book is because so many of them have low self-esteem and the word 'Bella' means Beauty in Italian therefore when they read the book, they fall into 'Bella's' mind and everyone calls her Bella which is an exotic and beautiful name. They enjoy feeling beautiful and being called beautiful even if only be default.<br>  <br>  I hope this explains to you all that the 'Twihards' are just pathetic, desperate horny housewife's or teenagers with no life experience and low self esteem.|`|oHF3YcEiaa	wow, harsh words, don't you think?<br>  <br>  I love Classics, The Little Prince,To Kill A Mocking Bird, I read Pride and Prejudice in the second grade and I know good writing when I see it. <br>  <br>  Teens (Girls really) love this book not because of the vampires but because of the romance, the romance is set up in a different interesting way. Teen girls always want someone like Edward in their life, though i think he is very controlling through out some of it. It's justa fantasy life girls want, being the damsel in destress and blah blah blah. I'm writing a romance book and I started before I read Twilight. But my main charecters name is Edward and it really annoys me when people compare him to Edward Cullen. I mean, Edward E. (teh one I'm writting) has a temper, lost his family, trusts no one, he has FLAWS, something Edward Cullen doens't have, Edward Cullen is perfect and every girl wants to be with someone perfect. Since the story is through Bella's eyes, every reading it feels tehy can be Bella. I read the book and I admitt I was crazy about it at first and then slowly it went away, I realized Twilight is just a Fantasy and I forgot about it. And Then whenever I showed someone my book they say 'This reminds me of Twilight' THAT ANNOYS ME SOOOO MUCH.My story is a love story between two people who cant be together because of the way the things are set up, the boy's father killedn his family and the girl's father is abusive, does that seriously remind you of TWILIGHT? <br>  <br>  It sounds like I don't like Twilight and that's not true, it's a cute way to pass time. Stephanie Myers writes a lot and I agree the writting isn't AMAZING as the girls gawk over it, but I guess it's the message in the text that is about love and romance, and the people that read this book usually never read any other classics and they love it because tehy are young teens girls. Girl's LOVE romance.

ceBTTCPwaa	Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll.[1] It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures.<br>  <br>  The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have given the story lasting popularity to adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the fantasy genre.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_wonderland" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_wo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/alice/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/alice/</a><br>  <br>  Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children's literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), generally categorized as literary nonsense. It is the sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Although it makes no reference to the events in the earlier book, the themes and settings of Through the Looking-Glass make it a kind of mirror image of Wonderland: the first book begins outdoors, in the warm month of May, on Alice's birthday (May 4), uses frequent changes in size as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of playing cards; the second opens indoors on a snowy, wintry night exactly six months later, on November 4 (the day before Guy Fawkes Night), uses frequent changes in time and spatial directions as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of chess. In it, there are many mirror themes, including opposites, time running backwards, and so on.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Through_the_Looking-Glass" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Through_the_Look...</a>|`|qDSvOOwBaa	Hummm--<br>  <br>  A descriptive essay in nonsensical prose that attempts to convey feeling through the use of characters in fantastical settings. Although you don't find out until the end a little girl Alice fall asleep and enters a world through which fantasy and reality are combined with animals who favor particular subjects unrealistically.<br>  This incredibly short essay is one of the most well read by children and adults in the history of the civilized world. It is the influence of so many other works-most notably L. Frank Baum "The Wizard Of Oz" which mirrors it's fantastical approach to the insecurity of a young girl.<br>  Alice's adventures through a mystical garden progress with an invitation to play Croquet with the Queen. Numerous characters such as the Duchess, a worm, a disappearing cat lead Alice to a "Mad Tea Party" which is the focus of the nonsensical symbolism and the main appeal which is so familiar today. A Mad Hatter, A March Hare and a dormouse exchange flowery prosaic lines with Alice in combination with riddles that is without a doubt masterfully brilliant and has never been even remotely attempted or achieved by any other writer in history.<br>  <br>  I could go on but it's difficult for myself to tone down the metaphorical style in which I write.

2Ko12Elfaa	Um.  The other two answers are of course usable advice, but before you do any of that, you need to get your thoughts in order.  What is the relationship between prejudice and the events in the novel?  Do the events simply show prejudice, or do they show it in a certain way (from a certain perspective)?  Find that, and then keep asking questions about it to narrow your focus.  This is something you can do any time you have to write about one thing in something else.

If color, a little more work is involved.<br>  <br>  The kitchen counter & sink, at night, is a good place to develop film, all you need to do is make sure ALL lights are off and the glow from anything, clocks, night lights, etc.. are covered as well. Also watch the window for stray light from there as well.<br>  <br>  The cameras have regular film in side them. It will be in a metal can, just as a normal camera. However, with the disposable cameras you have to "break them open" or pry them apart.<br>  <br>  Some snap open rather easy. Many do not. Do the opening of the camera(s) in room light, and watch out for sharp pieces of plastic that could cut your hands.<br>  <br>  Make sure the film has been re-wound into the canister before opening the camera and then have a bottle opener handy in the dark to open the film can.<br>  <br>  Spool the film on a reel and drop it into the developing tank and press on the lid.

GlteTTauaa	Plato imagines a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of the cave entrance, and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows. According to Plato, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to seeing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not constitutive of reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners.

kUE3Ddktaa	I love and appreciate British Lit, and I recognize its supreme importance in Western literature, but American lit is the nearest and dearest to my heart - especially the literature of the American South. My two favorite novels are "Absalom, Absalom!" by William Faulkner and "All the King's Men" by Robert Penn Warren. <br>  <br>  I have to disagree with the two "premises" of American lit claimed by the person above. The best American literature doesn't mythologize the past - it is intensely critical of the evils that lurk in our memory (a long and embarrassing history of slavery and discrimination, the butchery of the Civil War, the terrible gap between rich and poor, the corruption of our "merit-based" political system) and often ironic about the naive idea of "the American dream." Great American novels are about the dichotomy of the American experience - <br>  being told you can achieve anything versus the barriers that arise to prevent you. <br>  <br>  But if we're talking strictly poetry it's hard to choose - I love Billy Collins and Seamus Heaney equally. Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot are some of my favorites. How's a book-lover to choose? :)|`|TAIlyvgyaa	I read extensively from both sides of the pond.<br>  <br>  If I'm forced to generalize, I'd have to say I prefer British works, certainly when it comes to modern fiction.   <br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that I don't enjoy a great deal of American works, I think it's more that there are far more British writers I enjoy, in general, than American writers.|`|2Ko12Elfaa	British.  If you like Brit lit, you might remember the exchange from "The Picture of Dorian Gray," where Harry is talking to some women at a cocktail party about an American they know.  Harry says the American owns an American dry-goods store and when asked what American dry-goods are, he goes, 'Why, American novels, of course!'<br>  <br>  Basically, my problem with American lit is that it's based on two flawed premises: an obsessive desire to separate itself from English literature and mythologizing its founding fathers.  After the first century or two, it gets a lot better. :)|`|vmmMqhxXaa	Oh, wow.  I can't choose between them.  I love Shakespeare, George Eliot, Amis Kingsley ("Jake's Thing" is wickedly funny), Anthony Burgess ("A Clockwork Orange"), and J.K. Rowling.  On the other hand, I also love Mark Twain, Nathaniel Hawthorne (especially his short stories), Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King, Mary Doriah Russell (I just finished "The Sparrow"), and Orson Scott Card ("Ender's Game").<br>  <br>  So...I dunno!

Always show respect for others, even when you do not think they deserve it.<br>  If and when approached by a talent agent or agency.  Check them out carefully.  If you are too young to sign a contract, remember your parents will need to be very involved.<br>  <br>  Agents<br>  They do not look at your picture and resume and go out and try to find you a job.<br>  You should give them enough information about your skills and decent photos of you.<br>  Almost all agents know where to find out about casting for theater and movies.  <br>  When these castings are announced they look through their files to see who might have a chance.

d3407bb7e70be0ec132046c62291b987aa	There is a spring around the ink well sleeve at the back of the pen tip. It pushes the pen tip assembly back into the pen casing. The trigger when pushed down, forces the pen tip through the end of the casing. When you release the trigger, the spring pushes the pen tip/ink sleeve assembly back up, but it is blocked by a rotating cylinder which has four positions. One allows the assembly to move up, the other blocks it from moving up, the other allows the assembly to move up, the last blocks it from moving up. Each time you click the trigger the cylinder rotates 45 degrees, locking the pen tip assembly either in the out position or the in position.|`|fqX1pz9Naa	take one apart and find out, theres a plastic thing and a spring.|`|r3GSAPepaa	the spring in it;<br>  :)|`|G20zVKmSaa	Spring is locked when inside and pushes it out otherwise.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/pen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.howstuffworks.com/pen.htm</a><br>  <br>  If all else fails check out How Stuff Works for a description and often pictures to help you understand.|`|FPX6AcjFaa	It has a spring inside.<br>  <br>  Get a cheap pen and disassemble it so you can see the pieces and get a better idea of how it works.<br>  <br>  btw I have to say: randommmm. jejeje ;)|`|dgDW0Pt5aa	There is a notch that holds it in place.

aMl9ybuMaa	Darcy's letter to Elizabeth after his first proposal to her in Kent outlines the fact that part of the reason he removed Mr Bingley from Jane was because of the 'complete want of propriety' shown by several members of the Bennett family- particularly Lydia. Although Lizzie is already aware that Lydia's behavior is growing wilder, the letter from Darcy really drums it into her.<br>  <br>  She says to her father 'if you do not take the trouble to check her then her character will be fixed as the most determined flirt to ever make herself and her family ridiculous'. She also hints at the damage that Lydia's behavior has already done (ruining Jane's hopes of marriage to Bingley and casting the family down in the eyes of their acquaintances). Lizzie knows that Lydia will take every opportunity in Brighton to make a fool of herself and this will damage their reputations even more.|`|Li0q9NKCaa	Do your own homework!

I tried to understand how to live this life; whether i should be following religion way of praying everyday; or follow family traditions; or hard working type in scientific and academic world. <br>  <br>  Then one day, I did mind-blogging by myself, flowing through any knowledge came across my mind.<br>  At one point, I realized that I found what i have been searching for; that is the undoubted answer of how to live my life. "If I don't balance my diet then i will die of eating disorder, or diabetes or etc. therefore Life is about balance, in fact, Life is balance itself. When you not-balanced then you will die; i.e disappear from this world" <br>  (probably you might think i'm nuts)<br>  <br>  Anyway I felt my mind is very clear and light.

D9x1QSgiaa	About the only camera in that range I can recommend is the Nikon D-40 kit. It comes with the standard 18-55mm telephoto zoom lens. This is a 6.1 Megapixel camera. It has maximum shutter speeds of up to 1/4000th sec, max ISO settings of 1600, 7 automatic exposure settings plus Aperature Priority, Shutter Priority, Programmed Auto, Manual, and Digital Vari-Program. The 18-55mm is a pretty good portrait lens. <br>  I believe that the cost is around $450. USD....but if you shop around you can probably find them a bit cheaper than that, especially if you order it online.<br>  <br>  Another choice would be the Nikon D-60 which is a 10.2 Megapixel camera. It also comes with an 18-55mm lens. These kits are also available online for around $475. USD or less. <br>  <br>  <br>  Check out the site to learn more:<br>  www.nikonusa.com|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Nikon D40 D40x D60 are great and affordable, as are the Canon XTi and XS(?)

NYU37jfGaa	There were settlement houses in London, in England, and Jane Addams brought the idea to the USA, where she founded the first American settlement house, Hull House,  in Chicago in 1889, with her friend Ellen Starr,<br>  <br>  The purpose of the settlement house was to help the immigrant community.  The original purpose of the settlement house, to provide protection against the anonymous city gradually change dinto more active policies to overcome class barriers and campaign for social justice and equal rights.  Hull House was instantly succesful and by 1893 was running 40 local clubs, including a nursery, a dispensary, and a boarding house.  Within two years, the settlement had more than 50 rooms and endless classes that occupied every corner of its house for the twelve hours a day it was open.  A thousand people came to its programmes every week.<br>  <br>  There were six settlemtn houses in the USA in 1892, by 1900 there were nearly 100.

Meyer said vampires don't produce body fluid, so how worked that??<br>  and in general i like Bella every day less..I mean at the beginning of the saga I though she is an inteligent person but after the third book I doubt this:<br>  Why don't want she to marry Edward??<br>  Why does she complain all the time... she has a perfect life!!! No reason to complain!!!|`|8iHbDmHmaa	Who cares if you keep reading them?  I've read the whole series 4 times since last summer.

I have all the books and I've read them all 3 times. I've practically memorized them.

It's just that Edward's so hot, everything about his is... I feel butterflies in my stomach when I'm not reading the book and I think about Edward. Don't worry. Just be yourself. You don't need to stop obsessing, it'll pass. =)|`|dfMDTTUAaa	yeah i was too, they are soo good<br>  theres nothing wrong with that, it'll pass eventually<br>  Try reading something else like a jane austen book|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	I like the series as well.

hMtvuxqZaa	Holden rejects the norms of his times because he feels disillusioned and disconnected. This is extremely important as the story revolves around his thoughts and reflections on the world he finds himself in. If Holden had been able to conform and and adapt to this world then 'The Catcher In The Rye' would be a very different book. Take for example the moment when Holden feels an overwhelming sense of sadness when he sees the profanities written on the wall at his sister's school. If Holden was completely accepting of his society then he would not have seen something so profound in this.|`|v5YBydCGaa	Of course, if he conformed to everything then he would be a phony.
Fn5gpDOKaa	Very Bright Question you've asked.<br>  I first thought to choose Riddle's diary 'cause it was the first horcrux that Harry encountered and it was a good time-pass (write somethin' and you will get your answer, from whom, none other than the DARK LORD HIMSELFF)<br>  then I thought of Marvolo Gaunt's ring, I would have chosen it because it is a four-in-one object, firstly it is a historical ring of Salazar Slytherin, secondly, it is a Hallow (the resurrection stone being its part)<br>  thirdly it is a horcrux, and lastly it was the main reason for the death of the greatest wizard that ever lived, Albus Dumbledore.<br>  Next I thought to choose Slytherin's locket because it is the main attraction in both 6th and 7th book, and it introduced R.A.B. to us.<br>  Next ithought to choose the Hupplepuff's cup because it takes our heroes to the Lestrange Vault and it was really difficult to aquire it.<br>  <br>  Next I came to Ravenclaw's Diadem, because it was seen by Harry unknowingly in the Room Of Requirements, and it was the reason that made us and Harry peep into the Ravenclaw common room.<br>  <br>  Nagini was my next choice because as others said, it was another live horcrux other than Harry, and I like how she slithers over the shoulders of the Dark lord, the place for which Bellatrix Lestrange would give anything in exchange.<br>  <br>  And lastly I came to Harry Potter, and for known and common reasons it(he) also is my favorite Horcrux.<br>  <br>  But finally I accepted defeat and I came to a conclusion that I would choose The Ring-***-Hallow-***-Horcrux, or Marvolo Gaunt's ring.<br>  <br>  Thank you for reading.|`|c07C7D0laa	I liked slytherin's locket the best, because of the great way, it was tied in with the fifth book, and the way harry and ron destroyed it. Amazing how something so evil brought forgiveness, brought harry and ron back together, even in sense helped ron and hermione get together because it opened up the conversation in which harry assured ron that he only love hermione as a sister. That's why it's my favorite. I think the silver doe was one of my favorite chapters.|`|CoGTm3lVaa	OH MY GOSH!!!! i liked ALL of them!! <br>  riddles diary because i loved how harry destroyed it and all and how riddle was dying and being plunged into and all that cool stuff!!!marvolo's ring and slytherin's locket were really awesome too!! i loved how when hermione touched the cup, it would multiply!!!! Ravenclaws diadem was cool too!!! and man i loved how NEVILLE was the one to kill nagini!!!so awesome!! and last but not least, HARRY!!!! man i loved how wen voldy said crucio and how harry was induring the pain and then he DIED and saw dumbledore and that little person( part of voldy in harry) and wanted to help it but dumbledore said not to!! man that was sooooo cool!!!!!!!!|`|ZuWD3SVfaa	The diary would have to be the most interesting it was the first glimpse into a horcux that you are introduced to though at the time you have no idea what it is.|`|P81HhXLnaa	Nagini!<br>  <br>  It was just so awesome when Neville killed her and her head flew off! So amazing! *Claps for Neville*<br>  <br>  It was also cool how Nagini can actually do things, like kill! Yay Nagini! She also was (other than Harry) the only alive horcrux!|`|6K4YX6ulaa	I think that the most interesting one destroyed was Harry Potter but it was also really shocking to figure out how Marvolo's Ring was obtained by Dumbledore and how he destroyed it! I love the Harry Potter series! This is my favorite series of books!|`|q4DsA5GMaa	Favorite:  Marvolo's Ring because it killed that arrogant prat, Dumby.<br>  <br>  Least Favorite:  Nagini that ***** killed Severus!|`|XPNypBd2aa	Slytherins locket is pretty cool, in a really dark way.<br>  But Harry being a horcrux was far better bcuz he wz a living being and he least expected it.|`|VvKJUCYgaa	I like the following Horcruxes (from most to least):<br>  <br>  <br>  Nagini<br>  Harry Potter<br>  Slytherin Locket<br>  <br>  <br>   .... They just seemed the most interesting to me, how they affected the trio, the way they were destroyed. ^_^|`|4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	The diary, it was a pretty big thing in the 2nd book, and was interesting, with Riddle's younger self preserved in those pages...|`|zHfppzqwaa	Slytherin's Locket.. for sure.<br>  Slytherin is my favorite house, and I just love to say "slytherin's locket" out loud.  doesn't it just roll off your tongue?<br>  <br>  Slytherin's Locket|`|I0rTPsN4aa	Marvolo's Ring<br>  Coz its a horcrux & also a Hallow.|`|S1YTA8Feaa	i like the diary because it was so sinister and awesome >:D|`|kABv7xUraa	riddle`s diary, and nagini. ;3|`|0WKkXIyKaa	I quite like Nagini .. it was pretty cool to put a horcux in something living, like harry potter.<br>  <br>  edit - also the locket, i love how it even said in the fifth one that they found a locket that no one could open, it was mentioned so quickly, then became such a big thing.|`|86oPkfzOaa	Well, Harry was not technically a horcrux, since Voldemort did not make him one by doing the spell and everything. But, besides Harry, I guess my favorite was Nagini, I guess because she helped Voldemort become alive again and thats what killed him. Also, because Neville beheaded her, and that was the coolest way a horcrux was destroyed.|`|XGzC67P5aa	I think that Marvolo's locket was very interesting. Though it itself was my favourite, how it was destroyed was all the more. It's incredible how such a small piece of something could cause the great Dumbledore's death, and so much to happen. It was the Horcrux that caused so much: the whole adventure in the seventh book, Ron getting mad at Harry and leaving etc. It also was interesting when Ron destroyed it too. Not that it was good, just neat how it happened.|`|jT1UU1CUaa	I think Harry because it was so interesting how he was a horcrux the entire time, without him knowing. The bond it created between him and Voldemort was so cool. Also, the way he had to "die" to get rid of it made it the most fascinating horcrux by far.<br>  <br>  peace.love.harrypotter:)|`|IWaxUqDzaa	The locket or the Diadem. The locket, because I really like the story behind it and how we got to witness it. But the Diadem, because it kind of gave us a glimpse into another founder's past other than Gryffindor and Slytherin's.|`|E0rrWduQaa	either the locket or Nagini<br>  the locket was the hardest to find and they had to go throught the most to find and<br>  and nigini just cause that snake was always pretty cool|`|o6IPqzrJaa	interesting question...<br>  <br>  OK,  I won't say Harry Potter just because I like the character, however, I will say Harry Potter, because I think it's really awesome, strange, weird, creepy, and a great idea to turn Harry Potter, the chosen one, the Boy Who Lived, into a horcrux, even though it was not Voldemort's intention. That proves what a great author JK Rowling is! What an idea, I had no idea what was going to happen, it seems JK Rowling always has a trick up her sleeve! <br>  Nagini was an interesting horcrux too, well all horcruxes are "interesting", god, I sound like Hermione, I just think Nagini was an interesting choice to turn into a horcrux, the object that holds a part of your soul, and a part of your life. <br>  I think the Ring was a cool horcrux because it was a deathly hallow.|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	Slytherin's Locket because i love in the book how Rowling described it so vividly. i also really like how she revealed that Ron likes Hermione(even though everyone knew that) and how Ron got a larger part in the destroying. It also brought back Ron and Harry's friendship and the weeks following the stabbing of the locket was fun reading because Hermione is so mad at ron.  i'm ordering the locket from the Noble Collection in a few weeks.|`|AA10659685	Riddle's Diary<br>  <br>  because we find so much about Voldemort's past.<br>  and it's interesting.<br>  and because i like snakes<br>  and because i think Tom Riddle is cute.<br>  it's so cool how it works and where the chamber is.<br>  Damn...Voldemort...such a genius...|`|jcX7g2Mcaa	based on the way it was destroyed harry potter was most interesting<br>  based just on what it was slytherins locket was the darkest it seemed|`|Iwk92vqyaa	By far, Harry Potter. <br>  A living person as a horcrux? How cool is that? Not an idea easily beaten.|`|9SXnUOb3aa	Harry Potter.<br>  <br>  It's amazing how Voldemort was able to put part of his soul inside Harry.|`|7tiH0gREaa	I liked that Harry was the seventh horcrux.|`|uXLDyIXmaa	Slytherin's Locket because it sound so cool!<br>  <br>  i want one:)

Zxcvtmwraa	I would define it as a time when a person's percieved benefit -- or necessity -- from an action they would usually consider ammoral exceeds all of the negatives the person would expierence as a result.<br>  <br>  Beyond that it really depends on the specifics of the person.|`|g54tGcRvaa	People always say for there to be good there has to be evil.  I think that's just hogwash said by people who have never experienced true unjust evil.  There's no such reason why we can't just live in positivity.|`|AA11935914	Evil is irrationality, and that is never necessary unless you at war<br>  Then morality changes.<br>  Rules for peacetime are quite different for war time.  People that think they are at war when they are not are irrational|`|gwM3ZXuEaa	Well, necessary in this case doesn't mean "Logically unavoidable" but instead "morally permissible" due to the action's end result. Thus your example of the amputation is defined; a man has an extremity that must be removed for him to live, and the Doctor knows that doing this to save his live would sacrifice his lifestyle. While sacrificing his lifestyle can be here considered "evil" the end of saving his life is much more important, and therefore "overrules" the evil due to necessity. I wouldn't ask whether "Necessary evil" is real, but instead where it can be applied, E.G. what can be considered a necessary evil.|`|hdFn4Dobaa	No dear, this concept contradicts itself.<br>  <br>  It is not a " Necessary Evil " for Doctors to cut off a person's leg to save their life............it is quite logical and realistic. The Life is more valuable than the appendage. If we keep this logic, then it is saying it is better for the person to die, than to lose an appendage. If we can live without something...by all means cut it out, cut it off, repair, or replace it with something that works. Many times we can replace it with something almost as good as the original.<br>   A person can always get another career or live another lifestyle, but they cannot get another life. We have but one life to live, and we need to try to live it to it's fullest, otherwise we have wasted a gift.|`|pYj8KZUNaa	Necessary Evil is something that is evil but it must be done to prevent a greater evil.

It is as it is written. Evil, yes, but something that must be done at times. <br>  <br>  There are Evils all around us all the time.

7Srd7Pliaa	You have a couple options.  You can manually tag them on your computer.  Or you can buy a camera that does it for you, but most of the ones that do it well are pretty expensive.  Based on the linked article "How to Geo-Tag Photos - GPS Jottings" you are looking at a Nikon D200, Canon EOS 1D Mark III, the Fuji S5, Kodak's DC265 and DC290, and the Ricoh 500SE.  Note: the Apple iPhone will geotag your photos, but it does not have a GPS unit.  It triangulates your position based on the relative strengths of cell towers.  If you are somewhere where there are no cell towers it can't figure out where you are.<br>  <br>  With some of the models listed you still need an external GPS unit that can connect with your camera.  Some cameras will work with a bluetooth connection and others need a special cable (like the D200).  Make sure you know what your model uses.  Cameras that work with the external GPS will be less flaky, but of course there is more gear.<br>  <br>  Check out the linked articles to see how to add the geotag information to your pictures after the fact.  If you embed the geo-tag information inside the EXIF data, many programs can use that information.  NOTE: some services like Flickr will read the EXIF data and automatically generate the Flickr geotags from your EXΙF info.|`|0LgpcOBDaa	This may not be the best way or as romantic (or for some people, as techno cool) but since you HAVE to buy a GPS ''something" to allow your tagging of photos, just buy a GPS with a large, easy to view screen... and photo the screen right after the pic you want to "tag".. <br>  <br>  I know this isn't as gee whiz cool as having it in the camera, or the camera doing it for you, but your still getting the same thing. You could, at home, put the #'s IN the pic using any image editing program that allows text and numbers to be added.<br>  <br>  Just an idea..<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson<br>  <br>  PS - I have a Fuji S-5.. I just haven't found a sound reason why I need to add a GPS to it yet.. I would rather spend the $$ on a new lens my self. Far more useful in my book.
f2AWSb48aa	I'm in my second year of A-Level photography now, in the first year we had to own or borrow a black and white manual film SLR camera, as this allows you to learn more about camera settings than you would using a digital on auto.

fAVO3NEmaa	Macduff is quite an important role. He is the main "positive force" of the play, almost an opposite of Macbeth. As the Thane of Fife, he and Malcolm lead an army and Macduff is the one who eventually kills Macbeth.<br>  <br>  (An interesting point: in the story the prophecy was that "no one born of woman" could ever harm Macbeth, leading Macbeth to believe that he would become King of Scotland without any interference. Macduff, however, was born by C-section and not natural birth, i.e. "untimely ripped from the womb" so he was the one who would kill Macbeth.)|`|7a2Ho55zaa	this is copied and pasted<br>  <br>  Macduff, the thane of Fife, is a Scottish nobleman. He travels with Duncan to Macbeth's castle, and with Lennox, arrives the morning after the king has been murdered to awaken Duncan, but instead finds him dead. Macduff announces to the gathered nobleman, including the king's sons, that Duncan has been killed. <br>  <br>  Macduff's words in the next scene are considered significant by some observers who argue that Macduff is the first character to suggest his suspicion regarding Macbeth's ascension to the throne.

MWEn7fcwaa	I suffer from that, but my chiropractor fixes it for me every other week! I suffer from osteoporosis, very mildly though mind you. Seeing the chiropractor makes a real difference for me, especially in my hips.<br>  The other thing you need to do is to get your teacher to check your technique. Make sure you're not twisting in your hips as you lift, which is a natural thing to do if you're trying to get the height on your kicks. It may be that you're getting lazy (so to speak, no offence!!!) and not using your core muscles and sustaining your turn out as you lift. That may be the reason why it's only just started in the past few weeks. <br>  Hope that helps! Jx|`|of049X1waa	the clicking is caused by one part of the joint not being as flexible as the other.

Firstly it shows how great/powerful Britain was - hence the name 'Great Britain'. At the end of Victoria's reign in 1901 Britain owned 25% of the world! (including oceans.) Like someone has already said it was due to Britian being masters of the seas which made it very easy for trades routes to be opened between colonies etc, and the transportation of raw materials. Raw materials was a crucial reason - the reason many countries hurried to get "a place in the sun" as Bismark one said was because there was loads of minerals etc such as diamonds in the african deserts, which powerful countries like Britian could exploit without getting much resistence from a poor country like Africa. Colonies gave Britain new places for naval bases so she could continue her naval supremecy, such as Heligoland and Malta. It gave Britain a bigger wealth from taxes, as well as a bigger fighting force - such as over 1 million indians fighting for Britian in the first world war, and many south africans too. We were masters of commerce so got vast amounts of wealth from trade.<br>  But mainly its because we could, we had the strength and the ability to control huge parts of the world, and get rich from it too =D<br>  Hope this helps! x|`|QJ19OBCbaa	The basis of Britain's empire building was it's naval supremacy.

G8xBrHTuaa	The Western Front. <br>  <br>  The initial German plan of campaign was to defeat France quickly in the west, while a small part of the German army and the entire Austro-Hungarian army held in check an expected Russian invasion in the east. The speedy defeat of France was to be accomplished by a strategic plan known as the Schlieffen plan, which had been drawn up by Count Alfred von Schlieffen (1833–1913), German chief of staff from 1891 to 1907. The Schlieffen plan called for powerful German forces to sweep through Belgium, outflank the French by their rapid movement, then wheel about, surround, and destroy them. As executed with certain modifications in the fall of 1914, the plan at first seemed likely to succeed. The swift German incursion into Belgium at the beginning of August routed the Belgian army, which abandoned the strongholds of Liège and Namur and took safety in the fortress of Antwerp. The Germans, rushing onward, then defeated the French at Charleroi and the British Expeditionary Force of 90,000 men at Mons, causing the entire Allied line in Belgium to retreat. At the same time the Germans drove the French out of Lorraine, which they had briefly invaded, and back from the borders of Luxembourg. The British and French hastily fell back to the Marne River, but three German armies advanced steadily to the Marne, which they then crossed. The fall of the French capital seemed so imminent that the French government moved to Bordeaux. After the Germans had crossed the Marne, however, the French under Gen. Joseph Jacques Césaire Joffre wheeled around Paris and attacked the First German army, commanded by Gen. Alexander von Kluck (1846–1934), on the right of the three German armies moving on Paris.<br>  <br>  In the First Battle of the Marne, which took place on September 6–9, the French halted the advance of Kluck’s army, which had outdistanced the other two German armies and could not obtain their support. In addition, the German forces had been weakened on August 25 when, believing the victory had already been won in the west, the German chief of staff, Gen. Helmuth von Moltke, dispatched six corps to the eastern front. The French pressure on the German right flank caused the retreat of Kluck’s army and then a general retreat of all the German forces to the Aisne River. The French advanced and, in an endeavor to force the Germans from the Aisne, engaged them in three battles: the Battle of the Aisne; a battle on the Somme River; and the First Battle of Arras. The Germans, however, could not be dislodged, and even extended their line eastward to the Meuse north of Verdun. A race to the North Sea ensued between the two belligerents, the objective being the channel ports. The Germans were prevented from advancing to the French channel ports chiefly by the flooding of the region of the Yser River by the Belgians. The western part of the Allied line was held by the British who, in the race for the channel, had advanced to Ypres, the southwest corner of Belgium. After taking Antwerp on October 10, the Germans endeavored to break through the British positions in Belgium, but were checked in a series of engagements known collectively as the Battle of Flanders. In December the Allies attacked along the entire front, from Nieuport in the west to Verdun in the east, but failed to make any appreciable gains in these encounters.<br>  <br>  By the end of 1914 both sides had established lines extending about 800 km (about 500 mi) from Switzerland to the North Sea and had entrenched; these lines were destined to remain almost stationary for the next three years.<br>  <br>  The Battle of Flanders marked the conclusion of the war of movement or fighting in the open on the western front. From the end of 1914 until nearly the end of the war in 1918, the fighting consisted largely of trench warfare, in which each side laid siege to the other’s system of trenches, consisting of numerous parallel lines of intercommunicating trenches protected by lines of barbed wire, and endeavored from time to time to break through the lines. In this type of fighting during 1915 in the west, the Allies were on the offensive; the Germans, who were engaged in a heavy offensive on the eastern front (see below), made only a single attack in the west during the year. The principal attempts in 1915 to force a breakthrough included a British attack at Neuve Chapelle in March, which succeeded in taking only the German advance line. The Germans unsuccessfully attacked Ypres in April, using clouds of chlorine gas, the first time in history that gas was used in this manner on a large scale. A combined attack by the British and French along the front between Neuve Chapelle and Arras, in May and June, advanced troops 4 km (2.5 mi) into the German trench system, but was unable to secure a breakthrough. Unsuccessful simultaneous attacks were made in September by the British in the town of Lens and by the French at Vimy Ridge overlooking the town.

Use your finger on the 2 fret above that string to mute it. Position your finger so that you are depressing the fretted note while at the same time touching the muted string. You'll have to play around till you can figure out the best way to mute that string but it's a very important and commonly used technique, especially in more rhythmic forms of guitar playing.
C77c0OE2aa	You need a graduated neutral density filter. These are labeled ND. What this filter does is darken half of the scene without affecting color.

Different colleges have different emphases - some are strong on acting, some on singing and some dancing, so you need to audition for lots of them.  The confidence thing could be a problem for you and is something you'll need to work on.  Take some singing lessons, keep dancing and keep acting and see where that gets you.  As for the West End, well, it's incredibly competitive.  A college course will equip you with a lot of the skills you need, but they won't find you jobs.  Once you graduate you'll need to find an agent - which is not the easiest of things to do either - and then hope that you're in the right place at the right time and have more than your fair share of luck.

Marriages might be arranged between families for the upper classes, but it was more usual for lower class people to choose their own marriage partners.<br>  <br>  By the 1800s however the age of marriage seems ot have dropped, as there were fewer opportunitites for young people to achieve independence by inheriting a smallholding or completing an apprenticeship, working for wages was becoming more common, and there was not particular advantage to waiting to marry, since the chances of achieveing independence was small.

The Ku Klux Klan was initially formed as a social group after the end of the War Between the States but soon became a sort of counter group to the Union Leagues and carpetbagger rule of Reconstruction. They fought against unjust persecution of the Southern people at the hands of the northern interlopers during the reconstruction period. One of the members was former Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was given the honorary but empty title of "Grand Dragon". After the end of reconstruction and the readmittance of the Southern states to the federal Union, Gen. Forrest called for the disbanding of the organization as there was no longer any use for it. Unfortunately, many disgruntled klansmen began turning their attention to Southern blacks who had been urged by the Union Leaguers and carpetbaggers to blame their former masters for any and all misfortunes and attempt retribution. Most Southern blacks didn't do anything, but as some thinking they would be protected by the yankees did some things such as prevent their white neighbors from voting, etc. when the carpetbaggers left, some of the klan turned their anger toward these blacks whom they blamed for the reason for their own plight.  As the actions of the KKK grew more violent and more racially biased, Gen. Forrest campaigned against the KKK and it almost died out. In the 1920s, D.W. Griffiths book "The Clansman" inspired the silent movie "Birth of A Nation" which caused a tremendous upsurge in KKK membership. These new klansmen were pure racists and joined for purely racist reasons. They claimed to be an American christian organization and adopted the U.S. flag as their official flag and also the cross and the bible as their symbols. In 1948  when senator Strom Thurmond split with the national Democrat party and formed the "Dixiecrat" party, and spoke out against the federal policy of school integration, a waning KKK once again attempted to make themselves respectable and began using the Confederate Battle Flag (sometimes incorrectly referred to by dullards as 'the Rebel flag') in their public rallies and claiming to be the continuation of the Confederate Army. While nothing could be farther from the truth as the Confederate Army was an integrated fighting force comprised of whites, blacks, hispanics, Jews, asians, and American Indians as well as both Catholic and protestant soldiers. The Confederate secretary of State was a Sephardic Jew named Judah P. Benjamin. <br>   The modern KKK is a small group of radicals who hate everybody but themselves and their Nazi buddies in the Aryan nation group. They neither represent the South today, or the Confederate Soldier of years gone by.  They are a small group with most of their membership today in the states above the Ohio River.|`|pbw7chpyaa	The 1920s Klan was rather different than the !9th century Klan.  Where the 19th c one had mostly been composed of southerners who sought to control ex-slaves through terrorist tactics, the 1920s one was broader based.  Much of its focus was anti-immigrant in the north, with more of an anti-catholic, anti-jewish, anti-eastern european bent.   It was nativist and drew a large number of the "responsible" people in many communities.  Often organized through churches  by giving clergymen free membership, the Klan exerted quite a bit of power in many small northern communities, as well as its more traditional power in the south. Often it became involved in republican party politics, in opposition to the many large city, democratic (catholic) machines of the time.   If your grandparents were involved in small town government, who knows what dark secret might lurk in their closets? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So think of an organization closer to today's "minutemen", rather than the leftover confederates of the prior century.|`|c03e3e8b621829924bbadbc4c5c146adaa	people who are lawless, and who aren't afraid of the law--

AA11664474	England felt they were providing governance and military support for the colonists and they should pay for it.  Unfortunately, the military support was not IN the colonies, but being used elsewhere and the governance was already supported by local taxes (as was the local militia).   The colonies did not want British troops mucking up things and they certainly didn't want to pay taxes for what they weren't getting (namely representation in Parliament).  <br>  <br>  To put it in a modern context, we have a territory called Puerto Rico which has steadfastly voted down statehood.  They have no vote in Congress because they are a territory.   The US pours billions of dollars into Puerto Rico every year, but the citizens of Puerto Rico do not pay income tax because they are a territory, not a state.   We have every reason to demand that they become a state and start paying taxes, but the big businesses located in Puerto Rico has managed to keep that from happening.  It would be completely fair if we gave them an ultimatum---become a state or go independent.<br>  <br>  From the Puerto Rican point of view, though, they have the best of both worlds.

England was providing military help to the American colonies to protect them from the onslaught of the French and their allies.  It seemed only fair to the English that they should be able to quarter troops in American homes, requisition supplies from local (American) sources, and have the colonists help pay for the soldiers who were defending them.  The problem was that the neither the colonists nor the Colonies were represented anywhere in the British political system, particularly not in Parliament, where taxes were voted.  There was no input from America and Americans did not take part in the discussion or the vote.  It was, as the phrase has it, "taxation without representation."|`|ASXeYOjAaa	The political climate had shifted, becoming what 20th-Century Americans would call "liberal."<br>  The colonial system had always worked by setting-up what amounted to mostly-independent countries. Each had its own legislature but its executive authority was appointed by the King. England could tax colonies but not the people directly. It would be up to their own legislatures to raise whatever taxes they needed and to choose the method for doing so.<br>  On the cusp of what would become the "Revolutionary period," London decided on its own motion that it could disregard the law and legislate for the entire empire; including the imposition of direct taxation done without the approval of the local legislatures.<br>  This is quite analogous to the situation here, particularly since the post-civil war "Progressive*" movement. The U.S. is by law a voluntary federation of independent nation/states but has for a long time operated as a single "Nation" wherein the States are treated as servile properties of the central government.

FLAtdWrmaa	My daughter had to make a musical instrument out of recycled materials for a school project.  She got all sorts of metal bits from our local garbage-dump shop -- old fire alarms, brass bathroom fittings (taps, pipes, pipe collars, etc), sproing-y bits of heavy wire and metal strips, etc. --- and made a fantastic-sounding set of bells.  It looked terrible, but played great (percussion style), and she used several different kinds of strikers, too -- wood, metal rods, rods with hard felt hammerheads on the ends, plastic rods, etc.<br>  <br>  Plastic films or sheets -- such as pieces cut from the sides of milk & drink bottles -- can be drawn on with markers, and cut to shape, then shrunk in a low-heat oven so it hardens up.  The shapes can be used for jewelry, toys (mind all safety considerations), game pieces for home-made games, lots of other uses.<br>  <br>  Actually, there should be loads of kids' stuff made out of recycled stuff:  beach toys, bottle-cap toys, arts & crafts stuff, kids gardening equipment, science experiments, magic-show props, and so on.<br>  <br>  Quilts are a venerable example of recycling of fabrics.  So are braided and crocheted rag rugs.<br>  <br>  Gardeners also recycle a lot of stuff into handy gadgets for their gardens -- bug traps, mini-greenhouses, candle lanterns, trellises, bird-houses, bird baths, path materials, garden dividers, etc.<br>  <br>  If you want to check out some really off-beat recycling efforts, google for hobo art and trench art.<br>  <br>  For something more modern, check out the TV series called "Scrapheap Challenge."  I think it's a British series, so you'll need to find out via the internet.  The people on the show always look like they're having loads of fun, too.<br>  <br>  Hope this gives you some ideas where good things could be found.|`|k6hbtPBRaa	Learn to sew and make clothes into new styles or purses for a sister or cousin or aunt.

Under the fire there was tube and chamber so that burning the fire created a low pressure zone causing liquid to be exchanged between two containers, the second container acting as a coutner weight for the door.

I also believe you have only given us a small taste of a world you have been living with in your mind for awhile now.  This process is called world building and I give you credit for doing it so well.  The story sounds as if it can grow into quite an adventure.  What you have presented here seems like the outline for the first few chapters and then the bulk of the book being what is to be done once he gathers the information.  <br>  <br>  ---   I wonder if the student is going to be able to figure out something that will have a direct bearing on saving the equatorial continent and if for some reason someone or more than likely an entity is trying to keep things going the way they are and the student finds himself in a fight for his life and possibly his planet.|`|IIa4efh5aa	It sounds like an interesting premise.

Ow3O7h4caa	To fingertap...here is an example plain and simple<br>  <br>  Put your index finter in the 5th fret small string which is A-note. Now , with the right hand, put your index or middle finger on the 12th fret and use your finger to pluck the string.<br>  As soon as you pluck it, hammer the 8th fret with the pinky finger and hold that note with the left hand and hit the 12th fret with the right hand.<br>  <br>  Now, re-pluck the 12th fret with right hand, and pull the string at the 8th fret with the pinky . This will sound the note on the 5th fret.<br>  <br>  This is done in a quick sequence. Hope I explained it correctly for you to understand.<br>  <br>  Check this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitartabbooks.com/freelessons/fingertappingthe7modes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitartabbooks.com/freelesson...</a>|`|0AUPrCMZaa	a pull off is just how it sounds.  quickly tap your finger on the string and pull it off, the vibration will sound the note.  you do this on the fretboard, you do this with your right hand<br>  <br>  <br>  in addition:  you are not limited to what left-T told you to do.  you can finger tap anywhere....but due to harmonics, some finger tapping will "sound" or ring better because of it.

ZB9zkbxxaa	The narrator introduces himself as an “invisible man.” He explains that his invisibility owes not to some biochemical accident or supernatural cause but rather to the unwillingness of other people to notice him, as he is black. It is as though other people are sleepwalkers moving through a dream in which he doesn't appear. The narrator says that his invisibility can serve both as an advantage and as a constant aggravation. Being invisible sometimes makes him doubt whether he really exists. He describes his anguished, aching need to make others recognize him, and says he has found that such attempts rarely succeed.<br>   <br>  The narrator relates an incident in which he accidentally bumped into a tall, blond man in the dark. The blond man called him an insulting name, and the narrator attacked him, demanding an apology. He threw the blond man to the ground, kicked him, and pulled out his knife, prepared to slit the man's throat. Only at the last minute did he come to his senses. He realized that the blond man insulted him because he couldn't really see him. The next day, the narrator reads about the incident in the newspaper, only to find the attack described as a mugging. The narrator remarks upon the irony of being mugged by an invisible man.<br>   <br>  The narrator describes the current battle that he is waging against the Monopolated Light & Power Company. He secretly lives for free in a shut-off section of a basement, in a building that allows only white tenants. He steals electricity from the company to light his room, which he has lined with 1,369 bulbs. The company knows that someone is stealing electricity from them but is unaware of the culprit's identity or location.<br>   <br>  The narrator stays in his secret, underground home, listening to Louis Armstrong's jazz records at top volume on his phonograph. He states that he wishes that he had five record players with which to listen to Armstrong, as he likes feeling the vibrations of the music as well as hearing it. While listening, he imagines a scene in a black church and hears the voice of a black woman speaking out of the congregation. She confesses that she loved her white master because he gave her sons. Through her sons she learned to love her master, though she also hated him, for he promised to set the children free but never did. In the end, she says, she killed him with poison, knowing that her sons planned to tear him to pieces with their homemade knives. The narrator interrogates her about the idea of freedom until one of the woman's sons throws the narrator out on the street. The narrator then describes his experiences of listening to Armstrong's music under the influence of marijuana and says that the power of Armstrong's music, like the power of marijuana, comes from its ability to change one's sense of time. But eventually, the narrator notes, he stopped smoking marijuana, because he felt that it dampened his ability to take action, whereas the music to which he listened impelled him to act.<br>   <br>  Now, the narrator hibernates in his invisibility with his invisible music, preparing for his unnamed action. He states that the beginning of his story is really the end. He asks who was responsible for his near-murder of the blond man—after all, the blond man insulted him. Though he may have been lost in a dream world of sleepwalkers, the blond man ultimately controlled the dream. Nevertheless, if the blond man had called a police officer, the narrator would have been blamed for the incident.
g54tGcRvaa	"Darwinism" is just a misnomer given to a philosophical defense of eugenics that most people do not subscribe to, not even evolution believers.|`|yUudoO1Raa	How do you figure that, especially the part about black people?<br>  <br>  Black people were the first known forensic race, appearing in Africa while most of the rest of the world was covered in an ice age. The Africans tried 3 times to migrate northward to Europe, during lulls in the ice ages, only to be pushed back twice before finally getting there and being able to stay. So Negroids existed before Caucasians. (What is really degrading is that Yahoo will censor the word that begins with N, even though it is a scientific word used in forensics.) <br>  <br>  Darwinism only means that God did not create Man and the other life forms in their current incarnation, that they began as primative entities in water and came out. Whales actually began on land during the period of Giantism and decided there was less competition in the water.<br>  <br>  ADDED: Hooray for Yahoo. They changed their policy and now allow the word Negroid. I'm glad they listen, even if it takes them years to do the right thing.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Why is it that you are presupposing that "darwinism" is 'dehumanizing'?<br>  <br>  And what do you mean  by "dehumanizing'?<br>  <br>  Darwin's theories are in not way implicitly dehumanizing anyone, let alone 'blacks'

y8bFwXZEaa	Existence is a self-sufficient primary. It is not a product of a supernatural dimension, or of anything else. There is nothing antecedent to existence, nothing apart from it—and no alternative to it. Existence exists—and only existence exists. Its existence and its nature are irreducible and unalterable.<br>  <br>   Leonard Peikoff “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,”<br>  Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 148<br>  <br>  Therefore, it has no beginning, no end in time, and was not created. "Nothingness" is not the "default position" for existence, because the contradiction would be that at one time "nothingness" existed until some "thing" was created to fill up the "nothingness."

God exist because everything that is wants to exist and the fear of not existing is too much to bear. Non-existence is all the dark matter and dark energy in the universe, the negative space. This is the conflict of existence. What is is because of what isn't and what isn't is because of what is.|`|hs54R6byaa	We are all, as a collective, God.|`|vwH7GN37aa	Well from a Christian stand point, the reason has already been given for why we exist. We exist because God wanted a family that would love Him AND love each other. However, since that's not the case with us, that is the reason why we have so many problems in the world. So the world needs Love, and God is Love. So we need God, who self exists. There is no creator of God, because God is the Creator. He just is....<br>  <br>  If you look at it from a time dimension perspective, God existed before the dimension of time was created. So in other words, there was no past or future. Everything that occurred was in the present. So for someone to create God, they would have had to exist before God was created. However, since there was no dimension of time, it's impossible for someone to create God before He existed, because there is no dimension of the past for the event to occur.|`|f709434270c89003b985d20c10431e2daa	It is similar to the question, which came first the chicken or the egg?<br>  I think non-religious people would go along with the chicken came first, probably a mutation of some ancient speck of nothing that evolved and was eventually able to reproduce.<br>  Religion followers would probably proclaim that God created the egg.<br>  As massive as existence is I find it interesting that so many people have so much faith that they believe one person/entity/whatever you want to call it created the world.<br>  That being said, I must add, I do envy those with faith.<br>  It would be simplistic and easy to believe that one magical being did it all and that he/she/it could answer prayers.<br>  That would take the pressure off feeling we have obligations to make the world a better place or to figure out why we do exist and how we humans can exist in the future.  I think an important question is why do dinosaurs no longer exist?  If the atmosphere and world changed once and wiped out life, couldn't it happen again?  Why didn't God help them, if that is who created all life?<br>   think that stories of God are no different than any other tale, it's an old story created to answer questions that are unexplainable.  Many people buy it because it is more comfortable to believe everything has and always will be out of our control than to see life for what it is, a series of evolutions~ of everything from matter to human beings.  <br>  We all exist because people, not God, have a daily positive impact on life.  Researchers look for a cure for cancer, teachers stimulate young minds, inventors invent things to improve the quality of life.  Are we to say that those people did not have original ideas?  That they were impregnated by God with knowledge? Sorry, I shouldn't be ending the answer to a question with a question~  very thought provoking!|`|bc8c5c1452aca6682b2a081f91596c9aaa	It is a strange notion. Many people verbally deny that God exist but yet in their hearts many know that there is a higher power than them.<br>  <br>  Look around nature, look around at everyone. Some time it is hard to deny that God does not exist. Look at Psalm 19:1<br>  <br>  19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God,<br>  and the sky above [1] proclaims his handiwork.<br>  2 Day to day pours out speech,<br>  and night to night reveals knowledge.<br>  3 There is no speech, nor are there words,<br>  whose voice is not heard.<br>  4 Their voice [2] goes out through all the earth,<br>  and their words to the end of the world.<br>  In them he has set a tent for the sun,<br>  5 which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,<br>  and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.<br>  6 Its rising is from the end of the heavens,<br>  and its circuit to the end of them,<br>  and there is nothing hidden from its heat.<br>  <br>  Many of us will stand in awe of creation and from there we know that indeed everything is created by Someone Bigger and Greater than us.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Oor1CJ5laa	Well... the religious people say they do know, that "God" created everything (including himself?).<br>  <br>  The scientists, well, they try. They can find a lot, but finding out how something started necessarily means finding out what was before. And before there was "anything" there was "nothing", and you can't really find "nothing".<br>  <br>  Maybe we'll know when we die?<br>  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  So my answer?<br>  No. I don't think we'll ever know all those who, what, when or whys.<br>  <br>  Which kinda sucks.<br>  But I'm not really sure we're be ready to know.|`|AA10188152	I think that after we will die.There is going to be answers to all of our question.And we will know everything without even having to ask because it'll be already in our head.|`|2588jLuFaa	this question is hard for all of us to ask.

He thereby became the first person to lead an expedition across the Pacific Ocean. This was also the first successful attempt to circumnavigate the Earth in history. Although he did not complete the entire voyage (he was killed during the Battle of Mactan in the Philippines), Magellan had earlier traveled eastward to the Spice Islands, so he became one of the first individuals to cross all of the meridians of the Globe.<br>  <br>  Magellan was the first European to enter the Pacific from the eponymous Strait of Magellan, which he discovered. He was also the first European to reach the archipelago of what is now known as the Philippines, which was unknown to the western world before his landing. Arab traders had established commerce within the archipelago centuries earlier.<br>  <br>  Of the 237 men who set out on five ships to circumnavigate the earth in 1519, only 18 completed the circumnavigation of the globe and managed to return to Spain in 1522.[1][2] They were led by the Basque navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano, who took over command of the expedition after Magellan's death. Seventeen other men arrived later in Spain, twelve men captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527 five survivors of the Trinidad.|`|daBtvDv7aa	the took a boat to the end... and didnt fall off -|`|QusqTXCaaa	Contrary to popular belief, nobody thought the World was flat.<br>  <br>  Aristotle was the darling of the church when it came to such matters as science and astronomy, and Aristotle was clearly convinced that the Earth was spherical.<br>  <br>  When Columbus decided to find a new route to India by sailing west,  his critics were actually right.  They were not arguing that the Earth was flat, but that a westward voyage to India would take far too long, and that's why he would never make it.<br>  <br>  Of course, the main reason why he never made it, was something to do with a huge, almost pole spanning continent blocking the way.

IFnrRtMQaa	Well I'm the same, I read them both and I read Twilight after Harry Potter. For a while, I thought Twilight was my favourite but then I went back and read the Harry Potter books again and I realised..<br>  <br>  Harry Potter is like.. it's own magical world. When I'm reading it, everything around me just fades away (it's not weird) It just shows how nicely described everything in the book is and how Harry Potter has it's own fantasy world.<br>  <br>  Whereas Twilight.. It's just a normal world with a bunch of vampires stuck in the middle of it that get up to some grusome stuff.<br>  <br>  Do you get what I mean?<br>  anyways :) that's my opinion<br>  xx|`|u2EUom6daa	Twilight<br>  <br>  i think it is a bit more grown up than Harry Potter and i love things to do with the supernatural, the Vampires and werewolves and i liked the Twilight Saga there is a good love story behind the Vampires and Werewolves and the story is quite original and the books follow the same story from Bella being a normal human girl to learning about the vampires and werewolves to becoming a vampire herself so the books follow on from each other like 1 big story broke into 4 parts.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter i like but is mainly about magic and the whole collection of book/movies are based on the same thing the three school children learning magic and saving the school and that's about it and i don't think the movies really follow on from each other like twilight does but i have never read a Harry Potter book only saw the movies so i might be wrong.xXx|`|yTquTHUPaa	I like Harry Potter, because I started reading that at seven. Harry Potter opened a new door for me -reading... I am now 14, and still love the books. They are original, creative and have a-lot of different genres mixed - fantasy, friendship, love...<br>  <br>  Twilight isn't the best book to read for me, because it was kinda the same thing - love and romantic scenes, death, violence, then more love... I only read the series last year, but don't think I will again...|`|PD2nE5daaa	i like both but with harry potter i have to watch the movies i like them alot better than the books for some reason. <br>  <br>  twilight i loved reading the books they kept my attention to the last page of the last book i loved the movie to.  i really don't know why harry didn't do that for me book wise. but movie wise there great though i did read the last one because i had to know how it all ended so i went out and bought it and thats the only harry potter book ive ever completely read. but i love both. both were well written.|`|6K4YX6ulaa	I love Harry much more as well but i chose him because it was more of a fantasy where everything you would ever wish for happened. Twilight (which i also love) is more realistic and makes you want the Cullens so much! I don't know i guess i don't really know why i choose Harry over Twilight but i just do.|`|XPNypBd2aa	Im a big fan of both, but i loved Harry Potter way before Twilight.<br>  <br>  To me, Harry Potter is more magical and in its own little world.

I have read both books and I prefer Harry Potter. I like Twilight BUT I prefer HP. <br>  <br>  Twilight is just your average book that will be forgotten in a couple of years. But HP will be talked about for years. Why you may ask me, well because you cannot compare it to Harry Potter, at least to me, for these following reasons:<br>  <br>  <br>  HARRY POTTER<br>  1. J.K spent more than 15 years on her plot, which turned out to be fantastic. While Stephanie just dreamed about it and started writing, she didn't plan her plot, and mark my words this affected her plot severely.<br>  <br>  2. J.K's writing is very captivating, it grips you like a hook and makes you read obsessively. While Stephanie's style of writing though some may find it good, is very weak, she uses the words too often and she writes three chapters each time she wants to describe how good looking Edward is.<br>  <br>  3. J.K's series is not only intended for females or a specific age group, as you can see many children, teenagers and adults enjoy it. While Stephanie's saga is basically for young females who didn't read many books to be able to judge with a professional point of view, though I don't call myself a professional, nor am I belittling any reader.<br>  <br>  4. J.K's plot is new, it is appealing, no one ever had that idea of a boy who lived due to amazing circumstances. Stephanie's plot isn't new, well I don't call human\vampire affection new, that is used in many books. Since vampires are known to be very seductive and lustful.<br>  <br>  5. J.K's characters are very well imagined and described, you can relate to them and find them similar to who you are or people around you. Stephanie's characters well not all of them, but most, are very annoying and rather dimwitted, I wish not to relate to them to tell you the truth.<br>  <br>  TWILIGHT<br>  <br>  1. It's not well written; Meyer uses the same adjectives over and over (for example, Edward is described as marble, stone, and godlike again and again). The plot is messy. I know it started off as a dream and all, but she should have planned the series out. She claims that as she wrote, her characters told her what to do and told her things she never knew about them, and that's absurd. <br>  <br>  2. The characters are bland, flat, one-dementional cardboard cut-outs. Firstly, Bella is a total Mary Sue. She's whiny and made Edward and Jacob her total *****. And soooooooo co-dependent on edward. I happen to find their relationship unbelievable, when did they fall n love ? Edward only likes Bella because she smells good. And Bella only likes Edward beacuse he's because he quote: "like a male model from a magazine" We don't know really anything about them other than their looks. And they only knew each other for TWO weeks before they fell in love, I mean lust.<br>  <br>  3. The purple prose is so annoying! "he sparkled like a hundred glistening sparkly diamonds" "His marle stone chisled hard rock body" "his eyes topaz smothered me" Not to mention of eyes and crooked smile every other paragraph. And her grammar is horrible: "My eyes fell on the ringing phone." Well according to Meyer Bella's eyes fell out of their sockets.<br>  <br>  4. Plot - There is no logical climax to the story.The whole chase and ballet thing seemed thrown together at the end, as if Meyer had just realized she needed an actual plot.<br>  <br>  5. If you make a fantasy world and rules STICK TO THEM!!! Renessme (ew) is not supposed to be alive. <br>  <br>  <br>  MESSAGES:<br>  TWILIGHT:<br>  1. Fall in love with the first person that you meet<br>  2. All women are damsels in distress<br>  3. A teenage girl should have no dreams except to fall in love, not even going college should matter to her.<br>  4. There is no such thing as friendship when you have the right man. ignore all your simple friends<br>  5. Perfection is bliss, and lust is a must<br>  <br>  HARRY POTTER:<br>  1. Love and friendship outlast all things<br>  2. Sometimes one must do what is right instead of doing what is easy<br>  3. Being honerable is not the best title in life<br>  4. Fame isn't everything<br>  5. The world is full of bad people but all of those bad people have a tiny bit of good deep down inside them<br>  <br>  P.S JKR's writing is great but not perfect where's SM's writing nothing more than an average fanfiction<br>  <br>  P.P.S Harry Potter sold 400 million copies worldwide, wheras Twilight only sold 25 million. You can argue that HP has been around longer but if you take all 400 million and divide them by ten (HP has been around for ten years) that's still 40 million copies each year. So that's answers your question right there. More people prefer HP.<br>  <br>  <br>  And on one last note I would like to say this:<br>  HARRY POTTER ROCKS<br>  (....\............../....) <br>  .\....\........... /..../ <br>  ..\....\........../..../ <br>  ...\..../′ˉ.|.ˉ`\./ <br>  .../... |....|....

a9wRfuuSaa	In general, books are first made by printing the pages. Anywhere from 8-24 (or possibly more) pages are printed onto a larger sheet in a specific layout that allows the pages to be correctly sequenced when folded in a specific way - like a map or a foldout poster in a magazine. This is called a signature. All of the signatures for a book are gathered and placed in the proper order, then the book is bound. There are a variety of methods used for binding books that typically use gluing and/or stitching the signatures together and then placing the cover on the book. The type of binding will vary depending upon the type of book (hardcover, paperback, etc...)

It's summer vacation, and they're having the last big fun-time together before school starts up again.  But when they hike back out to "civilization" after a week's camping, there are no families in their homes, and there are foreign soldiers riding around everywhere in trucks, with dogs and guns and such.<br>  <br>  Hmmm.  So the kids head back to their campsite, and try to figure out what to do.  None of them wants to go to the foreign soldiers and ask anything (well, duh...!), and all of them want to find out what happened to their families and all their other friends.  So they start planning night missions into their hometown, and into the farms all outside of town, raiding empty houses for food and supplies, and scoping out where the foreign forces are, where families and townspeople are, and what the invasion forces are actually doing. And, of course, whether they can do anything to help their own people.<br>  <br>  Eventually, they develop their night-raiding skills to the point that they actually become, on their own, a small guerilla-fighter unit, actively fighting the soldiers (mostly by sabotage) with no adult help.  <br>  <br>  Interestingly, Marsden never mentions the country of Australia, or the country (countries?) the invasion forces have come from.  Both New Zealand and the USA get occasional mentions, though.<br>  <br>  The characters are extremely believable.  The (fictional) events that occur are very plausible, and fascinating to read about -- it's really hard to put these books down, the author really makes you excited to find out "what happens next."  These people aren't superheroes, they don't overthrow the invaders and win the war all by themselves, but it's fascinating to try and figure out how much damage they're going to do to their enemy throughout each of their sometimes very grim adventures.  <br>  <br>  And there is lots of friendship, love, unlove, heartbreak, cliff-hanging, loss, trust, loyalty, depression, betrayal, accidents, injuries, illness, death, luck, captures, narrow escapes, triumphs, hopelessness, mystery, fear, lots of fear, ingenious invention, personal sacrifices, pettiness, exhaustion, and just plain stupidity. Oh, and explosions.  Even a little sex.  Not all by the central characters.<br>  <br>  But mostly, there is survival against the most enormous odds possible.<br>  <br>  I love these books.  Can you tell?|`|oHF3YcEiaa	Yeah, I was SO upset when I finished breaking dawn, read Wicked Lovely by Melissa Marr, it has a sequel, Ink Exchange, which I just got from the library.

They sold their surplus products to make money, female peasants for instance were usually in charge of the poultry and the dairy, and would seel their surplus chickens, eggs, butter, cheese, etc.  Peasants might save up enough money to go on a pilgrimage.<br>  <br>  There would be craftsmen and tradesmen of various kinds, blacksmiths, builders, carpenters, potters, weavers, armourers, goldsmiths, tailors, bakers, butchers, grocers etc.  <br>  <br>  There would be merchants, who could be very wealthy.  There might be businesswomen as well, women were sometimes succesful in trad eon their own account, like the Wife of Bath for example in Chaucer's work.  <br>  <br>  There would be professional men, clergymen, doctors, lawyers.  Monks and nuns.  A woman might be a midwife.  If it is prior to the invention of the printing press (1450) there might be people who worked at copying books.<br>  <br>  There might be knights, who sometimes had estates of their own, but were sometimes landless younger sons.<br>  <br>  Lords and Ladies might also go on pilgrimages.<br>  <br>  It is not quite true to say that medieval doctors just made stuff up (as a comment above does).  In fact, medieval doctors did have some knowledge of herbal medicines that were effective.  For example they used willowbark for fever (aspirin was developed from willowbark).|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Just make out a list of things people needed that they didn't do for themselves, especially people who lived in towns.

Witchcraft (while some whiches even live in ignorance of this) is a pagan art of nature worship, followed by Satanic rituals. They 'THINK' they are praying to the spirits of nature, but guess who answers? Yeah, Satan. Not the best guy to run into on a moonlit night. All magic is done by dealing with the evil one for your soul.<br>    I tell you, for the love of God, find christ.

[Acts 5 1They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes. 2When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him. 3This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain. 4For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. 5Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. <br>   6When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. 7He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!" 8For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!" <br>  <br>   9Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" <br>  <br>     "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many." 10And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. <br>  <br>   11A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. 12The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them." 13He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs.

AA11370093	Hi, Patina!<br>  <br>  In a word, perfection (completeness and purpose).  Good and being are identical.  Good isn't added to being because good IS being. From this, it follows that an increase or decrease of being correspondingly increases or decreases goodness.<br>  <br>  The concepts of being and good are formal distinctions.  Being denotes existence and good denotes the power contributing to the perfection of being.  Basic goodness is the object of the appetite or will, whereas the accurate concepts thereof (e.g. truth) is the object of the intellect.<br>  <br>  Evil, then, is a privation of being (perfection).  It is not being in itself, but a privation thereof.  Evil can be non-moral (natural accidents) or moral (murder); but in every instance, evil involves the privation of being.<br>  <br>  This forum does not afford an exhaustive examination of this issue.  If you would like to discuss this further, feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  Kind regards,<br>  Scalia|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Aristotle's "good qua good" is the objective standard of defining what is good for each thing in existence.

He looked at two groups of sick people: Those who were under a doctor's care, and those who did nothing.<br>  <br>  He discovered that there was no difference in the cure rates between the two groups. In other words, going to a doctor back then offered no better chance of survival than just doing nothing.<br>  <br>  When other doctors replicated Louis' study they confirmed his results. This was really the beginning of the scientific revolution in medicine. Doctors began taking their science more seriously, operating with more rigorous controls. And after the 1830s, the quality of medical care improved with each decade.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|orRJdm0maa	Terrible. Nurses where usually alcoholics.

The Road, by Cormac McCarthy-The story of a man and his son traveling across Post-apocalyptic America, and the turmoil the run into (I'm tellin you, it's beautifully written-nothing like you've ever read-trust me-and it won the Pulitzer back in 2007) 2.) The Story Of Edgar Sawtwelle-about a boy whi was born mute and how he grows into a man on a ranch In Wisonsin with his parents and about the dogs they own and train which halp him to learn so much about the world. 3.)

You might have seen the movie, but the book is way better (as always) and much easier to understand. <br>  It's about a girl who gets sold by her family and grows up to be a geisha. REEEALLLY good.<br>  <br>  The Life Of Pi by Yann Martel is also pretty good, although the first part is a little hard to get in to. It's about a boy living in India, he's travelling tooo.. america i think... his boat sinks and he survives on a lifeboat with a bunch of animals from the zoo. Great if you can get past the dull opening.<br>  <br>  A million little pieces by James Frey. About a man who is an addict, almost dies, wakes up on a plane.. Family is sending him to rehab.. It's all about his recovery. Probably one of my favorite books and the one I would start with. <br>  My friend Leonard by James Frey. It's the sequel to A Million Little Pieces, after he gets out of rehab, it's basically about his life and his friend leonard ( a guy he met in rehab)<br>  <br>  The I Chong.. by Tommy Chong.. You know, half of Cheech and Chong? <br>  It's his autobiography about his time in jail. Very Interesting<br>  <br>  The Giver (don't remember who it's by).. I had to read it in School tons of times, the first time was in like grade 3 (i was in the advanced class) and I didn't like it because I didnt understand it.. But I read it again in about grade 7 and again in highschool and it was pretty good.. Basically about this like, other world, where everything is SUPER controlled. People's jobs are handed out, people don't have kids, they're GIVEN kids. All the kids in the place have their birthdays together. It's super regulated. The Giver is the guy that keeps the memories from the old world, and the main character is to become the new one. <br>  <br>  <br>  Those are just a few, I haven't heard of the books you've read.. But try those :)

4LeHbW2raa	I think it because of the popular culture of our time( my teacher calls it 'm.t.v culture'). Every passing day makes us more  materialistic . We value only youth, money and all the things that money can buy. We strive to conform, to be" popular " ." What's in it for me ?" has become the guiding principle of our lives . Anything that doesn't contribute to our bank balance ,our image or our career aspirations is considered a waste of time. So old people have become a waste of time (unless of course the old man happens to be your boss).<br>    Wisdom, insight and memories are all the old guys have . We do not value these things much anymore - coz they don't come with a price tag or a brand name.We do not love our elders( at least not with the same intensity we love rock bands and sport stars), do not give them the respect they deserve and feel they have nothing to contribute. Is it any wonder then that we dread the day we shall be in their shoes?|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Eons ago youth was prized as it was the prime of your child baring , bison hunting life. This is why men are attracted to childlike women (blonde hair and large blue eyes).<br>  In times gone by and as people have lived longer most aged reasonably gracefully as there was no other choice, hence a generation ago you became a mother hit 30 and started wearing the same clothes as your mother.<br>  Now of course it is acceptable for older (like over 25 :P) women to continue to be fashionable at a high street level, to keep up with latest hair styles and even have a nip and tuck....they try to hold onto their youth because they , materialistically CAN.<br>  However this has also spawned a generation of adults who still act like children (living at home, no financial responsibility etc).<br>  Hanging onto youth and delaying ageing is only a way of fearing our gradual descent into old age and finally death.<br>  Am I rambling?? I am 31 you know...must be the couple of grey haris I found the other day :P|`|uNIHqmH8aa	People don't really know what they want. I think that being old has it's good and bad points. Yes, you can't run or be as active, but you have less screw-ups, being that you have learned so much over a lifetime, and many, many people around you who love you. I suppose once you get past the shallow reasons for not wanting to be old, the way you look and your physical shape, it really is quite nice.<br>  <br>  -Nov|`|AA12050428	There were a group of 12 year oldish kids on a train on which I was travelling and one, watching an oldish man getting off`, said, óh I never want to be old'.

We are at heart, living socially to have better chance of survival to live in this world.<br>  <br>  Being attractive is one of evolution way to keep us alive. That is why baby are mostly cute, having the charm to attract people. If they are all ugly as hell, no one wants to keep or adopt them, no chance to survive.<br>  <br>  As we are aging, we are physically losing the charm.

0Dj8pOgoaa	That was British Politic at that time.... they have been looking for new markets, for new colonies... everything was about trading, selling and buying goods like spices, gold, silver, exotic wood, fabrics, and many more things like that..... and always was the same situation, other country has been new market, british was trying to put some kind of supervisor there (governor) and after that they was trying to put Government Representative who was like a "Manager of the land :) "... but why they put thei ppl there ?? of course to have some kind of control, collect taxes.... that was double income: taxes plus new markets and new goods.... ohh and british wasn't the only country doing that :) Spain and France also did it... and Netherland did it before but after unfortunately political moves in USA they had no money for Out of country business|`|DIlNnjf8aa	Chris P's answer is good, I would add that by taking actual control of one of their foreign markets, they could exclude other countries from using them. Excluding other countries from having access to an important market was a major reason for all imperialist powers to take control of another country.

iL1tYfJMaa	What this is called is PANNING...<br>  <br>  you'll probably want to have the shutter priority mode on and for starters set the shutter to 1/100 or so....now, the idea is to FOLLOW the object with your camera as the shutter is open...in kind of and arcing sweeping motion....<br>  <br>  Its a good Idea to use manual focus...and you want to prepaln this type of shot...good ones aren't easy to get spontaneously.<br>  <br>  <br>  SO lets say you want a picture of a biker racer crossing the finish line.<br>  <br>  1. Set your camera up to be manually focused exactly at the finish line and keep it that way.<br>  <br>  2. Now, when you see the bike racer coming...start getting him lined up in your view finder...now follow the biker with your camera...and just as he is getting to the focus zone...snap the shutter and continue to follow the biker with the camera in a smooth motion.<br>  <br>  3. If you get it correct...you will have a beautifully in focus crisp clear biker, with a blurred background.|`|FXP2pnlJaa	Well, if you would like to, for example, have a person running in focus, and have the background blurred out, it's going to take some practice. I've never done it myself, but all you have to do is keep the focus on the running person, and carefully follow the runner with your camera. The background will be blurred, and the runner will be in focus. It will definitely take a bit of practice to get it right, but that's how it's done. Good luck with it! :D|`|bo54Lw59aa	Yes, shutter priority.  Or manual.  But shutter priority and pick the speed you need for the blur to happen.  Kinda depends on the speed of the object.  Start at 1/60 and work faster or slower from there.<br>  <br>  You'll need to pan with the object you want to keep in focus, and you may need to turn off auto-focus for this.  This'll take a bit of practice and effort.  If the object is conveniently moving along a set plane, a tripod will help keep your other motion (up, down, etc.) in check.|`|doPPYJIkaa	If you are to do it in photoshop later on, do this:<br>  <br>  - Take the picture into photoshop<br>  - Copy the layer with the picture, to create a duplicate<br>  - Use motion blur on the top layer. Filters-Blur-Motion blur<br>  - Create a mask on the blurred image. (To create a mask, go down by the layers, and press the button all the way down which is a gray rectangle with a white circle inside it.)<br>  - Use a normal brush with black or white, and just paint on the mask. This way, you can chose what you will see from the masked layer, and what you can see from the next one. If you brush over something you shouldnt have done, change color, and brush it back!<br>  <br>  Allright? ;)|`|TbTO5SXlaa	This site will fully explain the technique of panning with your camera. The goal is a sharp subject against a horizontally streaked background.<br>  <a href="http://www.ephotozine.com/article/Camera-panning-4768" rel="nofollow">http://www.ephotozine.com/article/Camera...</a><br>  <br>  You can also show motion by doing the opposite of panning. Mount your camera on a tripod, use f11 and a slow (1/15 sec, 1/30 sec.) shutter speed so your subject will be a blur against a sharp background.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	Rear curtain flash would work very well for this.<br>  <br>  The technique is to use a fairly slow exposure (determined by the ambient light) and just before the shutter closes the flash fires freezing the action.<br>  <br>  The result with someone running, skateboarding or cycling towards you or across the shot would be they would be perfectly exposed and sharp, but the blur recorded by the low shutter speed would be trailing behind them.<br>  <br>  The best mode for this is Av (Aperture Priority) as then you can set the depth of field. Select the aperture to give you a slow shutter speed (plenty of room for experiment here, try for half a second for starters).<br>  <br>  Using a tripod is favorite as the blur lines will be strait, the problem is timing it so the subject is where you want them to be when the flash fires.<br>  <br>  Don't try to pan the shot at first as then you have loads to think about and the results are more miss than hit till you get practiced at it.<br>  <br>  If you use a tripod think about the background as with this technique everything static will be sharp, the only blur you get is their motion blur.<br>  <br>  Chris

Recall that she had saved up money in order to send the children off for ice cream, and her need of Tom's services was a flimsy pretext for getting him in the house.<br>  <br>  In order to avoid punishment, she concocted a rape story rather than be punished for the socially unacceptable behavior of romancing an African-American man. Mayella was driven to act by her dreadful circumstances, and then was trapped in her lie.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	yeah, mayella was like a mockingbird, she didnt do anything to anyone and she was getting in trouble.  she was raped and that was like killing a mockingbird, which she was told is the biggest sin, because they do nothing but make beautiful music for her.  now at the time scout didnt understand that mayella had been raped but she saw how quiet mayella was and how everyone was against her so she had scouts sympathy. i hope this helps!|`|8hNL7p3aaa	Because she was raped.....<br>  And maybe because EVERYONE was against her...if you think about it Atticus wasnt exactly the NICEST lawyer =)<br>  =S

By running away, it seemed as if he was guilty, even though he didn't do anything wrong.
yDmLWsd9aa	Yes. Their father didn't wanted them there.  I guess the kids want to see the really of racism and unfairness for themselves. ;))|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Jem stood up to him.  He was telling his father that he is learning how to make decisions for himself and grow up, which is represented further by his taking his father's moral into play when he tells Scout not to squash the bug.<br>  Even though he snuck in to see it, he did it to live up to what he thought his father would honor.<br>  Atticus was trying to preserve their childhood by not allowing them to see how close-minded people thought, because he sets an example by being open-minded.|`|vvAyfBGCaa	Atticus didn't allow Jem and Scout to attend, they snuck in and sat in the "colored" section. They should have been there, because being there helped them to understand why the whole town was in a tither.|`|67f7a9562eea0008ccdd2892a04062f7aa	Scout obviously had to be at the trial, since the novel is in the First-Person Narrative style, and she is the narrator. Otherwise, there would be no way to know the details of the trial as it happend.<br>  <br>  Jem had to be there so we could witness the further deterioration of his innocence, sense of fairness, and right-and-wrong. <br>  <br>  You may need to re-read Chapter 16. You obviously missed the part where they attempted to sneak in to the trail, and waited too long. They barely managed to get Rev. Sykes to let them  in and had to sit in the balcony with the black spectators. This was without Atticus's knowledge or permission.|`|6K4YX6ulaa	Atticus did not allow them to go, they went without his consent and after he caught them he let them stay because they had already heard the worst parts of it. I think that if they wouldn't of been there then there wouldn't be that part of the book,because Scout wouldn't be able to tell us the court case.|`|gXn7HuWoaa	He did not allow them but they creeped it anyway. When Atticus found this out, he ordered them to go home but he soon realised that they had been in the courtroom for almost the full trial session so he eventually allowed them to remain there.|`|XPNypBd2aa	Atticus didnt kno bcuz they snuck in..<br>  Yea i think they shouldve been ther cuz they started to understand everything and form their own opinions.|`|QADdomjeaa	He didn't, they snuck in.
NjBt73f2aa	In a word, nowhere. Especially since the book just came out not too long ago. Books often take a while to be published online in some sort of E-Books format, and that's if they ever do. Sometimes authors choose not to have their books available online. <br>  <br>  If you really don't feel like buying the books, why not try finding them at a library? That way you can read them for free, legally, and you don't have to worry about getting in trouble or spending any money.<br>  <br>  Even if you do find a site that has the books, I really would not recommend using it as it's most likely not legal and could therefore create a lot of problems. Like I said, buying the books or borrowing them is the best way to go. ;)|`|h3A5WBPyaa	I suggest you just go buy it. You will not have a chance of finding it online.|`|kI6LeDhcaa	i was also thinking about this because im a huge diary of a wimpy kid fan but sadley you cant... yet but i do know that you can read the first one online!...i suggest you go to your public libary ! hope i helped

ZuWD3SVfaa	First off you need to finish it off then read through it and do another draft 99.9% of the time the first draft needs to be changed normally you will change it around three to four times before you even get to look at seding it to a publisher.<br>  Now this is where it gets tricky you first off need to research the publishers in your country and find out what they publish your age will have nothing to do with it, after you have found them write out the list and check how they take submissions either hard copy or email. Majority will want a hard copy.<br>  Then this is what you need to do:<br>  <br>  One-page synopsis of the manuscript; <br>  <br>  First 4 chapters printed on A4 paper (double line spaced); <br>  <br>  One page review of any books, already published, that cover a similar topic and an outline of how your proposal differs. <br>  <br>  Covering letter outlining the author’s writing experience, if any previous publications, work and any relevant life details. If the manuscript targets a specific market, please give a brief description of the intended readership and how your manuscript stacks up against competitors.<br>  <br>  This is what most publishing houses look at they do not need the whole manuscript, if they like what they will read they will ask to see more.<br>  I know it hates to be rejected but be set for it to happen, it rarely happens that the first place you send it to will love it and want to publish it. Also you are looking at anywhere from 1 month to 4 months for actually getting a reply out of anywhere.<br>  <br>  A another way of trying to do things is find an agent first, it is the same process as trying to find a publisher.<br>  <br>  All I can say is good luck and no matter how many people turn you down keep on trying.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Finish it first. Then join a critique group and get some comments on it. Then rewrite that first draft.<br>  <br>  Publishers don't care how old you are. They will want a story which looks as if it was written by an adult established author.|`|y5HeFW03aa	Just ignore the harsh comments<br>  <br>  But seriously, you only need to worry about this if you ever finish the book...<br>  <br>  Good luck =]|`|a0a4b271882587e60ffff0e04ab06fb3aa	The biggest hurdle for a first time author is finding a bona fide agent to represent you. Most agencies have thousands of manuscripts sent to them every year and typically, they only select a few works that are worthy to represent. Submitting your work directly to publishers is almost a waste of time, as the slush pile for publishers is ten times what it is for most agencies.<br>  <br>  DO NOT submit to anyone that requires up front money or "reading" fees. Most agencies will read your book for nothing if it's well presented and if they think it has merit. Reading fees are a rip off. You can check on legitimate agencies at the "Preditors & Editors" website. They keep an up to date list of current agents and any problems writers have had with them.<br>  <br>  Now, once you find an agency, you need a great query letter to get their attention. Search the web for examples. If your query letter is sloppy or has misspelled words, you're TOAST. Get a qualified copy editor to help you, if you can afford one. Then, once the agency reads your query and agrees to look at your manuscript, MAKE SURE IT IS PERFECT before you send it off. Again, bad formatting, grammar problems or poor spelling will doom you from the start. Pay an editor to proof your work--it's worth a few hundred bucks to get your foot in the door with an agent.<br>  <br>  After that, be prepared to wait up to 3 months for an answer from the agency. DO NOT submit to more than one agency at a time. If your work is good and the agency sees potential in it, they will offer you a contract. From there, it can be another 3 month wait for them to find you a publisher. Once you get a publisher, it takes about a year to actually see your book in print.<br>  <br>  You can also go the eBook route, which is becoming more popular every day. My books are available in Kindle format at Amazon and that has worked out well. It's much more acceptable now to start out with an electronic version and move into print.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. If you're serious about getting published, you can make it happen, regardless of your age. It takes time, patience and a lot of luck. And as a note of reality, of all the fiction books published in a given year, only about 13% ever sell more than 1,000 copies. Most (75%) sell fewer than 500. Contrary to popular belief, most authors don't get rich.<br>  <br>  Jon Baxley<br>  Author:<br>  THE SCYTHIAN STONE<br>  THE BLACKGLOOM BOUNTY|`|2kHQ3Icnaa	First of all, finish you story. Then, if it's already done, or once you finish, go to the library and check out a book called "Writer's Market" or you can get an online-subscription for like $3 a month by going to writersmarket.com. Search for agents that represent you genre. Research them as much as possible and try to find out if they want a one page query or a two page synopsis or a whole chapter. ( A query is an inquiry regarding the acceptability of or interest in an idea.) You can find information online on how  to write a query. Here's a good website: www.carolynjewel.com/craft/query.shtml <br>  That's pretty much it. Keep trying if you get rejected.

The North-East "Aberdeenshire" dialect, known as Doric. It is very thick and almost musical.<br>  <br>  2. Central-West-Glascow and Ayrshire area.

Soft cross lighting from a window can give a dreamy effect, but will have slow shutter speeds so watch for camera shake (and subject movement), use a tripod.<br>  <br>  Watch where the shadows are falling on her face, shadows give depth, but don't want to be harsh - hence the advice to avoid flash.<br>  <br>  If you take lots of shots eventually she will ignore the camera it will be just that thing mummy does - alot.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|osFEzMy5aa	Use the child or portrait setting, get low, and allow her to do her own thing.  If you try to pose kids at that age they get really frustrated and the melt downs begin.  Use a lot of props like tutus, tea set, playground, bubbles, etc. and be sure to set your camera on multi shot so it will keep taking pictures.<br>  <br>  I have the D60 and here is my flickr if you'd like to see pictures I took of my 2 year old nephew.

Not all shots have to be taken standing up. By doing so, you'll have to point your camera downwards, and the angle wouldn't be so nice. I suggest eye level, where most emotion can be captured from the face of your daughter. It would be good if you have an external flash, to use a bounced lighting effect to give some "glow" to your daughter.|`|AA11970662	Set your aperture to a low enough stop that you can use a high shutter speed. That way, you'll stop her motion. Low f/stops are also good for shallow depth of field. Also, always make sure your white balance is set for your situation so she and her surrounding will always be vibrant. Good luck!|`|l8cliTRIaa	just get candid one those are the best i have tons of my 3 year old catching him doing something naughty or playing those are the ones you will look at and laugh
L76NCybXaa	They are both good SIs, but if you want to get really better and think you can handle it, go with CPYB.  CPYB is an intense program. You will be doing tondus until you hate them. It will seem that your not "dancing" any more. All flashy stuff is put aside. But if you go there, and make it through, you will come out  better dancer. NCDT has an excellent program and you will improve there too. It is more fun then CPYB. I believe that anyone who wants to be a professional should go to CPYB at least once. Marcia's program really brings results. Just check the background of most professional dancers (NYCB especially)|`|KtPfSjsFaa	Sorry I don't know much about those, but you should definitely send a tape to the Joffrey summer intensive.  It is very strict and a very intense routine.  You stay in a hotel and they cater food to you.  You take numerous classes/day and there is a huge show at the end.  Not only that but there are sooo many male dancers, that everyone gets TONS of time to practice partnering, which is hard to find in intensives these days.  Good Luck!

Before the discovery and use of Iron,  weapons were made of bronze because it was the hardest metal available.  It is really not complicated.  As man progress, his weapons progressed with him.<br>  <br>  As populations grew, it became necessary to develop weapons that would kill more.  From sticks and stones to arrows and spears,  Fireballs (Greek Fire) and Gunpowder, with more and more killing power.<br>  <br>  Finally weapons of mass destruction.

AA11219693	If I regard knowledge to be the light of human consciousness, the light that illuminates the mind of thoughts, ideas, notions and concepts, then our sense of right and wrong, justice, beauty, truth and greatness are all conceptual and based upon this light. The order that we seek to implement in our physical world comes from these concepts. Whereas the light that illuminates our houses, grand squares, monuments at night, road and streets, or the light that comes from the Sun during the day, I would call to be the physical light, the radiation caused by photonic emission of subatomic particles from matter in an excited state, as for instance the heating up of the filament in electrical lights. <br>  <br>  Then aside electrical energy, there are two other forms of energies: magnetic, and gravitational. All these forms of energies are strictly physical in nature. And however ethereal or light they may appear to be they are nonetheless remain physically connected to matter. The electrical energy that we retain within the cells, as of brain cells, of our body for their function is also of physical nature, and is meant to serve, like all other things in the physical world, purposes of either good or evil, in human sense, or the purposes of soul, or that of worldly influences.<br>  <br>  The energy that can best describe the function, or existence, of human soul is could be spiritual energy, the energy that manifests its presence in the brain by generating thoughts, ideas, notions and concepts of none material, or abstract nature, and thus illuminates the mind with its senses of right and wrong, justice, beauty, truth and greatness, in their absolutes. <br>  <br>  I think the presence of aforementioned ideal concepts innate to human mind is manifests in from of our need for happiness, peace, love, order in our world, a world full of chaos and disorder. Imagine for instance that you enter into a room and find that everything is everywhere, there is no order, but when you come back after a few minutes you find that the room is all tidied up and clean, everything is in its right place and order, now you can quite simply understand that someone has been there to do all that tidying up while you were away. <br>  <br>  This I believe is what we like to see all around us, and this is what we aim to do in life in very many different ways, because this is what we have within our minds to signify the presence something, something that is more what might only be natural, something that can govern the natural, or physical, states of our being, including the system of natural energies remain operative within our body.|`|GlteTTauaa	While I don't believe in ghosts , many rational thinkers , biologists ,used the word "soul" as a metaphor for all the bio-electricity in our body .<br>  <br>  there is no scientific indication of what may happen to our electricity and consciousness after we die , so it's safer to say our energy will disperse and our consciousness will die ( since our consciousness was born , then it must die )|`|8hyxabYOaa	yes. thats literally exactly what i think. because ghosts are normally viewed as people who died tragically. what happens when a person goes through something tragic? hardcore electric currents running their adrenaline and what not, and when they die, what happens to all that energy? its dispersed.|`|20226e6187d57d2742c7b865538fa529aa	No, I think biochemical reactions are the electrical energy that powers our brain.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	It's certainly possible. That's a good theory.|`|RLqmrHlIaa	No. Whatever form energy or God takes is an illusion.|`|yULWldR4aa	thats a pretty good theory.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Is what is cool about Nintendo the electric current or the SOFTWARE?|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Interesting idea...who's to say? I do not know how science currently explains what generates the electricity that is present in our brains.<br>  <br>  I have often wondered along a similiar line of thinking --- does our soul or mind affect our bodies, opposite of what science currently believes?<br>  For example, if someone is clinically depressed, a doctor may say that your brain is producing less of chemical X, which is the cause, making you feel depressed, which is the effect. But, couldn't it be the other way around, i.e. that your soul or mind is truly depressed, which is the cause, and the reduction of a certain chemical in your brain is simply the physical effect or manifestation of the depression?|`|AA11550519	Yes, and no. Yes, I think that our brainwaves are our 'soul', but no energy is left behind when we die. If you unplug the device, the current is terminated, no?<br>  <br>  I would advise you to read the 'ghost in the machine' article....but its REEEALY long....get a cuppa before you dive in! However, the article proves there is no need to use the 'soul' as an explanation for any mental activity. It can only be used in discussions about unprovable afterlives!|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I might be the soul train but I am no soul brain! No ghosts of mine will be left behind...I am going to use up all my energy to keep this train running......|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	BRAIN?  Do I have one of those?

08bf43595004d99ab4dce32aa8d67110aa	Yes, but it's not as bad as you think. Like everyone else said, the actors themselves are not actually having sex, they are just kissing. But it's staged so it looks like they are doing it. Wendla takes the top part of her dress off, and Melchior shows his butt. That's all that is exposed. While this is happening, the song "I believe" is playing. Such a powerful scene. :)|`|ky3B42f6aa	No.  Well, at least not in the original version by Frank Wedekind.  What Broadway has done to murder the play, I don't know.|`|dqrT2m9uaa	Well, it depends on what you consider a sex scene. As the previous answerer said, it's called the hayloft scene, following the beating scene. What happens is this - Wendla finds Melchior in the barn, and they give in to their desires and 'do it'. Melchior places his hand on Wendla's breast, and I believe her breast is exposed, as well as Melchior's butt, but that's as bad as it gets. You don't see anything that would be too awkward to see, as far as I know. If you have any more questions, message me, because I have the script. The song that this happens in is called 'I Believe'.|`|isHVxaqWaa	Yeah, there is. But the actors themselves are not actually having sex. There's an exposed breast and butt, and there is thrusting. Stuff like this comes with being an actor. You have to be ready to do basically anything. And the actors are comfortable enough with each other and have done the scene so many times that it's, like, second nature.|`|EeabLB5eaa	Yes, it's called the Hayloft Scence and the song is "I believe". I've heard from the actors that it is not as uncomfortable as the beating scence. And there not actually haveing sex, Wendla exposes her breast Melchior his but. There basically makeing out lying down. It's probally the most beautiful most innocent thing you will ever see on brodway ( even though it's off now). Go see it on tour guarntee you'll love it!

P9S5wlLyaa	You should have a prologue-like first chapter with them being friends as children. It should be really sweet and the reader should automatically fall in love with both sweet little girls. That is the first impression that will then stay with the reader throughout the book. Thus, the reader will feel equally betrayed.|`|JxvVf1ZUaa	i think the one where he has flashbacks sounds more intersting. You could start of the story with a flashback then explain whats happening what he is thinking. Like your inside their head listening. The confusuion etc. Your story should then have a tense momounent where they are in danger but something they really did not expect happens towards the end and that will make the ending easier to write
Iwk92vqyaa	Many times. <br>  Sometimes, in the 'distant' past, I called them 'opinion pieces' for a newspaper where I worked. Or to write book/play/movie reviews for that paper, all involving research of a wide variety. Or to learn more about a person up for an interview for the paper, from Olympic athletes to innovators to sports doctors to 'you-name-it.'<br>  <br>  Other times, I write 'a research paper' right here on Yahoo Answers, often getting so caught up in the research for an answer I can't find the question anymore, once my notes on it are complete. But I still learn it; it's a good thing. I like to research things.<br>  <br>  ADD: Can't see where "research without an audience" is meant in your question, nor why "written... for fun" precludes an audience. For that matter, can't see the necessity of an audience for every step a person takes toward knowledge. [???]<br>  2nd ADD: Did write lots of research papers in college, but at the time thought there were many more fun things to do, y'know?

BzWQap1Haa	Rowling said in an interview that it takes time for death to "sink in".<br>  <br>  "    Email: Harry saw his parents die so why hasn’t he been able to see the Thestrals before?<br>           JK Rowling:  I knew I was going to get that one…that is an excellent question. And here is the truth. At the end of Goblet of Fire we sent Harry home more depressed than he had ever been leaving Howarts.  I knew that Thestrals were coming, and I can prove that because they’re in the book I’d produced for Comic Relief (UK) Fantastic Beaststs and Where to Find Them.<br>           These are lucky Black Winged Horses. However, if Harry had seen them and it had not been explained then it would cheat the reader.  So, to explain that to myself, I decided you had to have seen the death and allowed it to sink in a bit… slowly…these creatures became solid in front of you. So that’s how I’m going to sneak past that one.

Mig6O93Naa	sleeper service is nearly correct.  You can only get on Disney if 1. you live where the auditions are being held (LA mostly) and 2 your parents make it happen for you.  You can't get an agent by yourself,  you parents have to apply in your behalf.  Agents do not make actors, they represent people who are already actors.  You just are not going to be a Disney actress, so find an attainable goal instead.|`|S01zIagOaa	Disney is not where an acting career starts. If you research the IMDB pages of actors who show up on Disney shows you will see that they work for a variety of companies which may or may not produce children and teen oriented programming. This means they are in either NYC or LA and that they, as professional actors, audition for everything that comes along. It just so happens that Disney is the most recognizable name. <br>  <br>  So how do you become a professional actor? Well you start small wherever you are. If school theater or the drama department is available then that's what you do. You get your parents involved and together learn what the business of being an actor means. As a minor, your parents will need to invest a good amount of money in you and as you don't live in LA or NYC you (and at least one parent) will eventually have to move to one of those two hubs. Agents aren't going to bother and have no need to represent actors who don't already live in the cities where their offices are. In LA alone thousands of preteens, teens and adult actors roll into town every year to take a stab at the business.|`|YTmA12sNaa	Do you have training? ie theatre school, drama classes, etc?<br>  I think you maybe are too yound to enter disney just yet, they usually employ 15,16 year olds.

Being an older teen, both now seem slightly juvenile in their writing style (though I still enjoy both!)<br>  <br>  I would right now have to say maximum ride, for two reasons.  One is that I just read the last book and so it's fresh in my memory.<br>  <br>  The other reason is that maximum ride just seems more unpredictable, and I like books like that.<br>  <br>  But as I said, both books are great and I enjoy both immensly
0a78e11c60dc1aa5ae0fc490736a46a9aa	It depends on whether you are speaking from the perspective of educators or parents.  It is the job of educators to teach your child to conform, but for parents to help their children to accept themselves, their assets, their limitations, their passions.<br>  <br>  However, in a public education perspective, you need to take math.  Period.  However, in today's touchy feely world I think educators are trying to be parents, and parents are letting them.  This disrupts the educational process, which should be about conformity, so that a diploma represents proof that a graduate can perform to a certain acceptable level.|`|ZtGEyNJVaa	no... helping children appreciate the fact that each one of us is unique is important but the suggestion that it is important to "teach" children to endeavour to be different is counterproductive to a group that has an apparent need to "fit in". the key here is empathy for the needs of children sociologically. <br>  you might refer to Eric Erickson's work regarding psychosocial development.|`|YfCRmWeSaa	Yes, people need to learn things about themselves that will help them later on in life.  When certain things about our personality is brought to our attention, we can fix them if need be or work to improve them.  More people need to be self-reliant.  Far too many people look outside themselves for self-gratification.|`|Rc0FXAVHaa	Individuality can be important when it comes to ones relationship with<br>  oneself and when it comes to standing ones ground in the midst<br>  of things that are wrong.  However, we need others and it is<br>  important to respect wisdom of others who have more experience<br>  than we do and we should not be "individuals" at the expense of<br>  that or else we will ultimately fail.  We need wise individuals to<br>  unite with, not foolish or abusive ones - the same with ideals<br>  and decisions we make.  It is also not good to try to be self sufficient<br>  all the time - we need to help one another as a part of who we are - to help and be helped is key to our natures!  We are not mere survivalists<br>  and should not be!|`|KrpnKhFTaa	well, if teaching individuality leads to a dog-eat-dog culture where it's every person for themselves, i would say, in  that respect, it wouldn't be a good thing|`|va8quhPtaa	Teaching individualy is an important lesson. There is intimacy.|`|9Zfk1neoaa	thanks god everybody not thinking like you, otherwise we wouldnt have the schools, colleges and so on. teaching is not about only the teacher and the student its more than that. a man is a student throughout its life and he learns from the nature, society and everything he comes in interaction. oh its individuality but not individually. oh, come on you cannot be so much torturous to someone thats too for children, pls dont for gods sake.|`|8hyxabYOaa	ABSOLUTELY. why? because regardless of what society's norms are, each person is a unique and different individual with their own opinions, thoughts, ideas, and styles. it is important to show a child that being themselves is okay, and to be proud and strong as the individual they are. encouraging them to think OUTSIDE the box is key. its the different thoughts and ideas that will one day make this world a better place.|`|Z6oc1VgSaa	nope, actually it is something we should avoid. get to them early while they're still moldable. the aryan race is still possible SIEG HEIL!!!!!!!!
p0AUrLgwaa	The term "free states" refer to states where the institution of slavery did not exist. Some but not all of the northern states were "free states" while all of the states that comprised the Confederate States were slave states. Slave-holding states that were loyal to the Union, or north were: Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri. Since these five states did not fight against themselves it is absurd to assert that the 1861 - 1865 War Between the States was fought to end slavery. It was actually fought over states rights and the powers of the federal government versus the powers of state government. The Southern states fought to contain the powers of a central government according to the limits laid out in the Constitution while the north fought to expand the powers of the central government  at the expense of the state governments and the Constitution.

RrB51Mq4aa	You need an agent as most publishers will not accept unsolicited manuscripts. So get to writers.net and click on agents and find one that is after the genre that you have written. You will have to write a query letter more often than not telling them about yourself and with a short synopsis of your book or 3 chapters or so. On the strength of that they might take you onto their books and it is them that will go about getting you a publisher, they don't get paid unless you get published and that's where they pick up their 15%. If a publisher takes on your book as a first time writer you will gain the standard advance and you will spend a lot of time with the editor assigned to your story, lots of editing, changing etc and then once its published you will receive squat until the publishers have made the cash back on the advance and then you will start to receive royalties and hopefully make some money. I know it sounds like a real head-ache but there are reasons for everything, each step is like a spam filter, from agent to editor to chief editor etc, none of them want to waste their valuable time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|mN3b2p2paa	get it published and take it to a book store:):):):):):):):)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|YsNDkPd4aa	when people come around you ask them if they would like a book and if they say no ,keep going do the right thing|`|V6dz395kaa	amazon.com or maybe ebay.com
lcg1u1U7aa	Where it is true that the government was in mess by the early third century most of their problems could have been overcome if the means had been available.  By the third century the Roman Empire was in a real financial crisis brought on by the fact that their society had essentially become divided into rich and poor classes and the rich had exempted themselves from paying any taxes.  The taxes on the poor had become onerous to the point that poor people no longer supported the government and the money simply was not available to field a reliable army to deal with internal and external threats.|`|ScaAyzKHaa	By the 400s (the approximate time the Empire 'fell'), they had pretty much sealed their fates. The country had already been ravaged by decades and decades of civil war, government was fractured and pulled in a hundred different directions, not to mention overdrawn. There is also the issue of the Goths, who were so horribly mistreated by the Romans who were supposed to be helping them that they rebelled and sacked several major Roman cities before sacking Rome in 410.

rJxlKpj5aa	Two suggestions.<br>  <br>  Role Playing:  What we play with informs our roles, gender, social and other - and playthings may be used to impose or shore up the roles that others wish to assign to us.<br>  <br>  Playing for Keeps:  What we play with becomes the stuff of nostalgia, attaining the status of quasi-myth and having powerful association with the giver, the context of giving and our views of self.  We keep what we play with; and what we play with gives us reactions, roles and redolences that we keep for life.|`|xuhTe9X8aa	Ignorance is bliss - this draws upon the fact that when your a child all you care about is toys and playing, completely ignorant of the world.

TAIlyvgyaa	That can work and work well, if you get it right.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you have a common thread running through all of this, something that is clearly an element in each of the stories.  That makes it all hang together for the reader, makes it a novel (I believe that is what you mean by 'chapter book') rather than just a series of short stories with something in common.|`|8DwxwhStaa	As long as it all goes together, people don't like too much jumping around, be it characters, plot or theme.  I would write out a simple outline first, start with the beginning incident that gets everyone into the story, then list the climax.  Add the eight most important scenes inbetween (they can be written like a short story each) and see if it makes sense, flows well and seems compelling.  If it seems uneven or disjointed you will need to make the short stories flow together better.  Hope this helps.|`|y9wWczUraa	I think it's a fine idea, Katie.
