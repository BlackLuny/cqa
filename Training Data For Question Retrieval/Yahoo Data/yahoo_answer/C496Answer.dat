3yf0CONMaa	Sibutramina (Reductil, Meridia, Plenty, Sibutral)  Paulo Gentil  27/09/2002    A sibutramina  o principal componente de diversos remdios para emagrecer como: Plenty, Reductil, Meridia e Sibutral. Sua fun??o esperada  a perda de peso, conseguido atravs da inibi??o da recapta??o de serotonina e de noradrenalina (HANSEN et al, 1999, STOCK et al, 1997). A sibutramina deve ser usada simultaneamente com exerccios e alimenta??o adequada, e somente quando dietas e atividades fsicas n?o produzirem os resultados desejados.    A noradrenalina  um horm?nio liberado pela supra-renal e serve tambm como precursor da adrenalina, tendo como principais efeitos: eleva??o do metabolismo, aumento da freqncia cardaca e da press?o arterial. Ao evitar a recapta??o da noradrenalina na fenda sinptica a siburamina potencializa os efeitos deste horm?nio, aumentando o gasto energtico (HANSEN et al, 1998; WALSH et al, 1999).    A serotonina  um neutrotransmissor produzido no crebro a partir do aminocido triptofano, atuando como vasoconstritor, estimulador da musculatura lisa (presente nos rg?os), regulador do sono, do apetite e do humor. Ao inibir a recapta??o da serotonina, aumenta-se sua concentra??o, diminuindo a ansiedade e aumentando a saciedade (CHAPELOT et al, 2000).    Ou seja, a sibutramina atua atravs de dois mecanismos: aumento do gasto energtico e diminui??o do apetite.    Eficincia     Em geral, as pesquisas demonstram a sibutramina como eficiente e relativamente segura no combate  obesidade.    Em 2000, JAMES et al, administraram 10 mg/dia de sibutramina juntamente com um dficit calrico e obtiveram redu??o de 5% ou mais de peso em 77% dos pacientes ao final de seis meses. Ainda neste estudo os autores verificaram que sibutramina foi eficiente, tambm, na manuten??o deste redu??o ponderal por um perodo de 18 meses. Neste mesmo ano, McMAHON conduziu uma pesquisa que procurou averiguar a eficincia e seguran?a do hidrocloreto de sibuitramina na redu??o ponderal de pacientes obesos hipertensos. O estudo durou 52 semanas e, segundo os autores, as interven??es no comportamento foram mnimas. Mediu-se o peso corporal, o IMC, circunferncias da cintura e do quadril, nveis de triglicerdios, HDL, LDL e colesterol, como medida de seguran?a, controlou-se a press?o arterial, freqncia cardaca e rea??es adversas. Nos pacientes tratados com sibutramina a perda de peso ocorreu no primeiro semestre e foi mantida at o final do experimento, deste grupo 40,1%, perderam 5% ou mais do peso corporal e 13,4% perderam mais de 10%, em compara??o com 8,7% e 4,3% no grupo placebo, respectivamente. Esta perda de peso foi relacionada com melhoras em todos os parametros analisados. Os pacientes tratados com sibutramina tiveram um aumento mdio de 2 mmHg na press?o diastlica e de 4,9 bpm na freqncia cardaca, em compara??o com o placebo que teve queda de 1,3 mmHg na press?o arterial e nenhuma altera??o na freqncia cardaca. Os efeitos adversos foram em grande parte transitrios e de pouca relevancia, sendo a hipertens?o causadora de descontinuidade do tratamento em 5,3% dos pacientes do grupo experimental.    Normalmente os estudos tm verificado perda de peso significativa com o uso de sibutramina como os de CUELLAR et al (2000), que usou 15 mg/dia de sibutramina durante seis meses em pacientes obesos e obteve perda de 10,27 kg no grupo experimental, contra apenas 1,26 kg no controle, alm de redu??es significativas no IMC e na circunferncia da cintura. FANGHANEL et al (2000) administraram 10 mg/dia de sibutramina durante seis meses a pacientes obesos, obtendo perda de 7,52 kg em mdia para o grupo experimental e redu??o de 12,51 centmetros na circunferncia da cintura.    Especificamente sobre a saciedade, CHAPELOT et al (2000) analisaram os efeitos objetivos (ingest?o de alimentos) e subjetivos (sensa??es de fome) com a administra??o de 15 mg de sibutramina no perodo da manh? (08:30). A substancia come?ou a fazer efeito, mais ou menos, 6 horas depois da ingest?o, produzindo redu??o no consumo calrico de, em mdia, 311,5 kcal comparada com o placebo, esta redu??o foi ainda maior quando se analisou o perodo de 24 horas (redu??o de 382,4 kcal), sendo o efeito mais acentuado no almo?o (redu??o de 152,1 kcal).    Efeitos colaterais     Os efeitos colaterais mais comuns encontrados nos estudos foram: secura na boca, press?o alta, fadiga, constipa??o, taquicardia, anorexia, dores de cabe?a e ins?nia. (RICHTER, 1999; FANGHANEL et al, 2000; LUQUE et al, 1999; JAMES et al, 2000; BRAY et al, 1999, CUELLAR et al, 2000; SCHUH et al, 2000). Inclusive, houve alto ndice de desistncia dos paciente em alguns estudos, como no de CUELLAR, onde +/-37% do grupo experimental abandonou a pesquisa devido  ineficincia e aos efeitos colaterias da interven??o, principalmente infec??es respiratrias e constipa??o.    Como a sibutramina tem sido considerada segura e eficiente pela maioria dos especialistas, corre-se o risco iminente de abuso. Pensando nisso, pesquisadores franceses realizaram um estudo para averiguar os efeitos de doses abusivas de sibutramina. Na pesquisa, comparou-se 25 e 75 mg dirias desta substancia, com 20 mg de anfetamina e placebo. De acordo com os resultados, o uso de 25 mg/dia de sibutramina n?o produziu efeitos colaterais relevantes, j a dosagem de 75 mg/dia ocasionou efeitos desagradveis como ansiedade, confus?o e fadiga, sendo que os pacientes optariam por n?o mais receber altas doses de sibutramina, ao contrrio da anfetamina, que produziu efeitos positivos no humor e foi considerada agradvel pelos pacientes (SCHUH et al, 2000).    Conclus?o     Apesar de muito usada e prescrita por mdicos e pseudoespecialistas a sibutramina tem seus efeitos colaterais e suas limita??es. Lembre-se que ela s deve ser usada |`|bb8fd004d586212774b7c8f0810de347aa	Amiga, vou lhe responder como profissional (sou farmacutica). A sibutramina realmente a ajudar a emagrecer mais, mas como n?o pode ser tomada eternamente, voc voltar a adquirir o peso perdido assim que parar de tom-la. A equa??o para perda de peso  apenas uma:  Calorias ingeridas - calorias consumidas = Nmero negativo  Essa  a nica forma de usar a energia armazenada sob forma de gordura. Se parou de emagrecer  porque precisa reduzir ainda mais as calorias ingeridas ou aumentar as calorias consumidas. Ou diminua a quantidade do que come, j que segundo voc a qualidade j  boa, ou aumente a atividade fsica.

Comecei em Mar?o, e a minha mdica quer que eu continue at ao fim de Setembro (mais ou menos) mas n?o sei se vou aguentar, pois eu nunca tinha tido obstipa??o (constipa??o) e agora tenho e  muito complicado.

A minha mdica mandou-me seguir um plano estilo nutricionista para que eu me habitue a uma "dieta de diabtico" - comer muitas vezes ao dia mas refei??es pequenas para depois da dieta n?o sentir muita fome e n?o voltar aos antigos costumes. Ela falou-me em fazer um desmame...  Se s tem que emagrecer 6 quilos, eu acho que seria melhor investir em exerccio fsico, mas como o mo?o na academia me disse ontem, a gente a fazer exerccio "encolhe", perde gordura, mas ganha msculo, por isso n?o chega a perder peso com muita rapidez (dependendo da forma fsica que se tenha, claro) A gente nota que perdeu gordura na roupa. Por isso, esse pouco peso a mais que voc tem  relativo...  Espero ter ajudado  Rosinha

La sibutramina es una droga aprobada por la FDA a principios de 1999 para el tratamiento prolongado de la obesidad. Su utilizacin se limita a pacientes con un IMC mayor a 30  mayor a 27 cuando presentan complicaciones como diabetes y/o dislipidemia.     Presentado como un supresor no anfetamnico del apetito, la sibutramina no es un sustituto de la dieto terapia, sino que viene a ser uno de los pilares de un tratamiento anti-obesidad serio:    Dieto hipocalrica     Cambio del estilo de vida     Aumento de la actividad fsica     Farmacoterapia     Tiene un efecto anorexigeno, reduciendo el apetito, siendo en la mayora de los casos especifico por los hidratos de carbono (dulces, galletitas dulces, alfajores, pan, etc).

Su efecto perifrico ms interesante es que acta estimulando los receptores beta-3 adrenrgicos que son responsables del balance energtico y la termognesis corporal ("quema de grasas").     La sibutramina est contraindicada en personas con coronariopatia, cardiopatia isqumica e hipertensin no controlada, tambin en accidentes cerebrovasculares o arritmias cardiacas.

Quando um beb anencfalo sobrevive aps o parto, ter apenas algumas horas ou alguns dias de vida.    A m-forma??o geralmente  reconhecida durante o pr-natal. Aps o diagnstico os pais se deparam com a difcil decis?o entre vida e morte.    Apesar de a gravidez poder ser levada adiante normalmente (pois a sade da m?e n?o corre risco maior do que em uma gravidez de um beb saudvel), muitas vezes as m?es s?o aconselhadas a interromper a gravidez.  No Brasil a interrup??o  crime, pois o aborto s  permitido legalmente em duas condi??es: quando a gravidez resultou de um estupro ou quando a vida da m?e est em risco. Ainda assim, pode se conseguir uma liminar com um juiz, pedindo a antecipa??o de parto. Isto ser feito com acompanhamento mdico.

Your mom is right for being concerned, she loves u and wants a healthy daughter. If you have an eating disorder.....stop and tell her to 2 get u help. You are already beautiful and could actually go for a little extra weight. Leave your body alone and just nourish it, you'll be fine~ When the body is malnourished long enough your face and skin will start to look horrible.

You are thin all over, and it doesn't look nice at all.    At 5' 6". you should weigh about 10- 10st 7|`|6LxXR61Waa	I would say you weigh about 105-110 lbs (48-50kg or about 7.5 stone).  To get an accurate BMI, you should have your real weight though.  Go to a friends house or to a doctor's office or just stop by a gym and ask if you can weigh yourself.      Obviously, the people on here can't calculate that for you, since you've gotten estimates from 65 - 120lbs.  It's true that you're very skinny, but you don't look anorexic and seem to have a good attitude.  Running, especially long distance, tends to make most people quite skinny and you do have a long-distance runners body.  Plus, you look quite young and may have had a growth spurt recently, so sometimes your body can take awhile to catch up.    Good luck with your project and just remember to be healthy.|`|U1DlhTQGaa	like 90 pounds... go to a friends house and weigh yourself|`|axdgjqROaa	Around 100 lbs?

Con vistas a atender rpidamente a estos enfermos, hospitales y sanatorios de Rosario ya incorporaron una modalidad de atencin que recibe directamente a aquellos que ingresan al centro de salud con dolor agudo en el trax.

You may think that people are out to get you, but try to remember, that there are mean spirited, cruel people everywhere. I have had to deal with such rude instant messages here I couldn't believe it...(really disgusting)...I try to forgive them,and then take a deep breath, and move on...try not to let people get to you...you sound so trapped right now and that is sad, because people could care less about each other these days.|`|v3IobQCgaa	This video will definitely help you:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b1GKGWJb...  :-)    Please pay CLOSE attention to 9:16 - 11:27 in the video.  (They very well could have been speaking about you in that part!  After reading your question, this is the part of the video I immediately thought of.)      By watching this video, you'll discover how you need to start turning things around.  It all begins with your MIND.     Good luck.      p.s.  And I think it might be a good idea to start somewhere fresh, where people don't know you.  Not so far away that you can no longer get the medical help and continued therapy you need... but far enough away that the people who live there aren't folks you grew up around.  If you can't move out of town, at the VERY least try to move to a different area of town; a different neighborhood.    One strange part of your message:  the part about cashiers, helpline workers, and library workers, etc. being aloof.  They have a right to be aloof - they don't know you.  Just be polite and courteous to them (without being phony, and thinking negative thoughts on the inside), and 9 times out of 10, those feelings will be returned.|`|MkUjrpe9aa	You need a shrink mate!|`|AA11900069	Hello.  We all probably have felt like that at some point in our life.  I don't believe that people are conspiring to keep you down, or do you over.  They are probably just reflecting the attitude you present to them.        I live in the South of England.  We are much more closed to people, on a daily, inter-personal level than Northerners traditionally are.  Here, people use the same shop, the same bus, and such without ever talking to those they meet daily, for decades at a time.  I have lived 15 years in this road, and talk with just three of my neighbours, only to say what a nice day/lousy weather we are having.  We are intensely private here.  It is different at work.  I work in construction, and to get things done, I have to talk with everyone from 17 year old agency labourers to multi-national company directors.  I am polite, curteous, and often use a joke or a pun to try to get them to crack a smile.  It usually works.          have a think about mirrored attitudes.  If you were the boss, and had two people in for the same job, equally qualified and experieced, and one seemed happy, sociable, gave a damn about the feelings of others, seemed respectful and pleasant, and the other candidate sat beneath a gloomy dark cloud of cold shadow, who could suck the life out of the room when they entered it...       It's a pretty easy choice really, isn't it?|`|DF5mmF41aa	I think your problem is that you're looking for reasons to pity yourself, quite frankly.    My life hasn't been the best either. Neither have lots of other peoples'. But I don't sit there and complain that it's everyone else's fault and I'm such a victim.    You're a victim if you choose to be a victim. And if you choose to be a victim, you're holding YOURSELF back.    If you need help, find it. Don't sit around and mope about how it's everyone else's fault.|`|kkFJql15aa	I know want you talking have had same problem ,but i don,t the answer to , you and me both neen to fibd nice genuine people not many around these but there out there some where|`|h2tMpOBTaa	If a Hottentot taught a Hottentot tot  To talk ere the tot could totter,  Ought the Hottenton tot  Be taught to say aught, or naught,  Or what ought to be taught her?

Hoy tengo 30 a?os y lucho por mantener mi peso, lo he hecho  durante casi diez a?os, es muy difcil por que tengo alma de gorda, me gusta comer, adoro los dulces, el chocolate es mi perdicin. Tendra que pesar mis 70 kilos o un poquito menos  y estoy en 73 kgr -__-, no los puedo bajar, parece que desde el a?o pasado esos kilos de  ms se han soldado en mi cuerpo, por suerte soy alta y voluptuosa ( la naturaleza fue generosa  con mi busto) y los kilitos de ms pasan desapercibidos ^^    Con sinceridad el peso es un problema para mi, tengo que controlar mucho mi dieta, pero  no me obsesiona, si quiero comer algo que me gusta lo hago y con satisfaccin... despus voy al gimnasio ^^    Eso en cuanto el peso corporal, ahora psicolgicamente, pues cambi mucho, estoy ms segura de mi, antes cuando iba por la calle o entraba a algn lugar, trataba de pasar desapercibida, ahora no, me muestro como soy, no voy a decir que fue sencillo,  fue un cambio muy grande adaptarme a mi nuevo cuerpo, buscarme la ropa apropiada, reconocerme en el espejo, es un shok fuerte y difcil de manejar, por suerte tuve y tengo el apoyo de mi mam, que fue mi compa?era fiel durante todo el proceso, si baje de peso se lo debo a mi fuerza de voluntad, pero por sobre todo a la compa?a de mi mam, que siempre me apoy.

Yo recien empece en el gimnasio y tampoco podia alzar 5 libras de mancuernas y ya voy por 10 lbs. Empece hace 2 meses. Es cuestion de esfuerzo y dedicacion. Cada uno de ellos paso por lo mismo, si la actitud de esta gente continua, y me sorprende que tu entrenador no te lo haya dicho, cambia de gym y tal vez de entrenador. Ya veras lo mejor que te vas a sentir tan pronto empieces a ver progreso. Sobre lo emocional con los demas, es importante que arregles tus cosas contigo mismo primero, olvidate de los demas por un tiempo en ese sentido. Cambia de amigos, de lugares de salir, de seguro encuentras otra gente con otras visiones. Toma las cosas con calma y no te desesperes, todo malestar es pasajero por mas que sientas que no lo es. Dile a tu entrenador lo que sientes, el debe estar super acostumbrado a lidiar con este tipo de frustraciones en el gym, todos pasamos por altos y bajos en el gym.

Tampoco estos msculos tienen una elasticidad que les permitan dilatarse naturalmente. Por ello, la penetracin anal debe ser practicada con sumo cuidado, para evitar la propensin existente a los desgarros y fisuras anales.    Por este motivo, cuando se practica sexo anal, suele usarse algn lubricante para facilitar la penetracin. En cuanto a los lubricantes naturales, son muy frecuentes el uso de la saliva o bien practicar la penetracin anal despus de la vaginal. Pero, como ambos lquidos se evaporan rpidamente, la penetracin tendra que ser inmediata. An as, no suelen ofrecer gran garanta. Por ello, la mejor opcin es recurrir a lubricantes artificiales. Es conveniente que el lubricante se aplique en el pene, en el ano y en cualquier objeto que se vaya a introducir en el mismo.    En caso de sexo anal con condn, se debe tener especial cuidado en emplear un lubricante que sea compatible con preservativo. El lubricante recomendado sera uno de base acuosa de buena calidad. Los de base oleica es mejor evitarlos porque pueden da?ar el ltex. Por motivos de higiene siempre es recomendable el uso de condn, incluso en la penetracin con objetos.    La aplicacin del lubricante debe conllevar su morbo y su parte de excitacin sensorial; en este sentido puede ser conveniente si no se siente reparo a ello, pasar la lengua por el ano de la otra persona, e introducirle los dedos impregnados con lubricante con suavidad, lo que ayudara a dilatar y relajar el ano de la persona que va a ser penetrada, y reducira significamente la sensacin de dolor inicial de la penetracin.      Relajacin del msculo del ano y dilatacin del esfnter  Como normalmente el msculo del ano (esfnter anal) se encuentra cerrado, el sexo anal podra ser doloroso si previamente no se tiene la precaucin de distender este msculo (una buena manera sera la realizacin de juegos sexuales). Se recomienda dilatar o ?ablandar? el esfnter anal previamente con aceite emulsionado, otros geles especiales, cremas o saliva e introduciendo lentamente un dedo en el ano, movindolo suavemente para luego ir engrosando con otro y otro y llegar a producir una expansin progresiva del msculo.    Adems puede resultar til el empleo de un dilatador anal o consolador, generalmente de forma cnica, aunque puede haber otras variantes como bolitas unidas que cada vez tienen un tama?o ms grande. El principio es el mismo: jugar con el ano para que ste se acostumbre a tener algo dentro y se relaje.      Inicio de la penetracin  Para reducir las sensaciones de dolor es importante realizar la insercin del pene o del objeto de manera paulatina, lo que permitir que se produzca una dilatacin y adaptacin gradual de los msculos. En ocasiones ayuda empujar ligeramente el objeto introducido como si se estuviera defecando para que la dilatacin sea ms rpida. En un primer momento quizs puede suponer extra?o realizar este gesto cuando no se est defecando, pero ello no producir ninguna expulsin inesperada o indeseada de la materia fecal, por lo que se puede empujar sin miedo.      Placer en la fase de penetracin     Hombre penetrando analmente a una mujer (arte hind)En el coito anal o pedicacin la mujer obtiene en gran medida su placer al ser estimulado el tero, el cual frecuentemente es poco estimulado en el coito vaginal. El hombre lo obtiene a travs de la estimulacin de su prstata.    La penetracin anal exige generalmente la eleccin de un ngulo apropiado, pues el ano es ms apretado y menos flexible que la vagina. En el caso de la ilustracin, se observa que la cadera del hombre est relativamente ms alta que la de la mujer.    Usualmente la persona penetrada complementa el coito anal con la masturbacin, lo que contribuye a una multiplicacin del placer y a relajarle la musculatura anal, con la consecuente facilitacin y mejoramiento de la penetracin anal. Por otra parte, las terminaciones nerviosas excitables en la zona ano-rectal son centenares de veces ms numerosas que en la vagina (en el coito vaginal la condensacin neural se restringe al cltoris y, eventualmente al llamado ?punto G?; as si no existen fobias la penetracin anal puede llegar a ser ms placentera para la mujer. En el momento en el que la pareja ?pasiva? (la persona penetrada) logra el orgasmo, contrae fuertemente la musculatura anal provocando una fuerte presin sobre el amante activo lo que le facilita a ste el orgasmo.    El placer procurado por el coito anal no slo deriva de las sensaciones fsicas, sino tambin de las subjetivas (?romper un tab? por ejemplo) y de una reminiscencia de la fase o estado anal (segn el psicoanlisis).    Sin embargo, la mujer frecuentemente se encuentra desde la infancia condicionada para considerar como ?negativo? al coito anal, de modo que un intento compulsivo de llevarle a un coito anal puede ser percibido por ella como una especie de violacin, de esto se entiende que la relacin debe hacerse con el mximo acuerdo posible.      Masturbacin anal  La masturbacin anal es la autoestimulacin enfocada en el rea del ano. Los mtodos ms comunes para la masturbacin anal incluyen la insercin de uno o ms dedos, algn tipo de juguete sexual, e incluso elementos no especficos. De todos ellos el sistema ms comn suele ser el uso de los dedos. Es importante, para no sentir dolor la persona penetrada y no da?ar sus paredes rectales, que las u?as estn bien cortas.    La masturbacin anal puede aplicarse en hombres y mujeres de cualquier orientacin sexual, ya que el ano contiene numerosas terminaciones nerviosas que pueden ser estimu|`|j9QmV4Mnaa	Mala lubricacin?|`|e1q1O97Saa	jajajajajajajaj que es esta pregunta juassssss no podia hacerla mas chistosa? que locota..|`|eRBaMWVkaa	el ano no es muy elastico y por cada penetracion lo vas abriebdo ms,eso es lo doloroso, ya despues que estn mas abiertos no les doler.

La sibutramina fue desarrollada originalmente para el tratamiento de la depresin, aunque su efecto sobre el sistema nervioso central hizo que creciera el inters por su aplicacin en la obesidad. Se trata de un medicamento que suprime el apetito aumentando la disponibilidad de un neurotransmisor llamado noradrenalina.  Esta clase de frmaco, que en el pas se introdujo en el mercado con el nombre de Aderan, debe ser recetado por un mdico.  Pero no solo saca el apetito desmedido por los hidratos , sino que ademas quema grasas por termogenesis esto da un equilibrio entre saludable manejo de cualquier, dieta ,tornandola raoida y sin esfuerzo aunque algunos adicionan triacana de accion prolongada para complementar la quema de grasas y disolucion(lipolisis) y tisanas de potenciadas hierbas diureticas y laxantes(de origen natural para reducir los efectos colaterales de la hipertencion y eliminar tambien el exeso de lipidos, liquidos y la constipacion.  A mi me funciono de maravillas aunque muchos dicen que la experiencia es intransferible, los amigos que fueron con esta misma doctora siguieron controles y metodos similares y obtubieron resultados favorables  pd: un gran interrogante?existen buenos y malos remedios o gente mal medicada?  segundo interrogante ?que tiene mas efectos colaterales los farmacos citados o el sobrepeso?  Veamos: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpSL_RVTZ...  ?es bueno ser prejuicioso y decir "medicacion noooooooooo", o es siempre lo mas sano es lo mas operativo en materia de regimenes alimentarios.  pd: he dejado ya la medicacion y no existio el tan temido por muchos efecto rebote(creo que el unico rebote es el que hace uno si viendose bien comienza a comer y entonces se vuelve como pelota rebotina.sin ofender, las dietas ?yo yo? o los pacientes ?yo yo?  Tambien hay que ser menos hipocritas y que nos traten a los gorditos como a cualquier otro enfermo,los deabeticos saben que la insulina tiene efectos colaterales, pero igual se utilixza como complemento a la dieta, y creo que la obesidad no escapa a estos ejemplos.

Lo recomendable son 3 comidas y 3 meriendas para que el metabolismo se acelere lo mas posible, esto te va a hacer que tengas hambre casi todo el tiempo.

wIRXHxZDaa	La carne de res contiene un conjunto de nutrientes potentes que incluyen zinc, hierro, protena y vitaminas B  nutrientes que trabajan tan arduamente como usted todos los das.    Es posible que el zinc no sea un nutriente  en el que usted piense frecuentemente, pero  su cuerpo lo necesita para muchas funciones esenciales, tales como el crecimiento y el desarrollo, el mantenimiento del sistema  inmunolgico del cuerpo, la cicatrizacin  de heridas, y el control del apetito.  La carne de res es la principal fuente de zinc.      La carne de res es la tercera fuente de hierro en la dieta estadounidense, despus de los panes y los cereales enriquecidos con hierro. Sin embargo, el hierro en la carne roja es absorbido ms completamente por el cuerpo que el hierro que contiene el pan, los cereales y otros productos vegetales. Hay dos factores que pueden aumentar la absorcin de hierro de los alimentos vegetales  la carne y la Vitamina C. Se ha demostrado que el consumo de carne durante las comidas aumenta la absorcin de hierro en alimentos vegetales de dos a cuatro veces. Este efecto de mejoramiento es conocido con el nombre de factor de la carne.     ?OK?

La espinaca tiene mucho hierro si la comes cruda mejor, en ensalada combinada con queso, tomate y albhaca, es muy rica. y tambien le pods agregar lentejas, El alcaucil tambien tiene un alto contenido en hierro.|`|oHD7RsEjaa	Yo soy naturista, no como carne roja y carne blanca, solo como el pescado.

El hierro, tambien esta en el huevo, en vez de comer carne, tambien en el pescado, lentejas.. y seria mejor tomar o comer luego de una comida con hierro, vitamina C, ya que ayuda a fijar mejor el hierro.

a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Bueno, yo digo que numero uno, el trotar lo hagas luego de hacer las pesas o la musculacion. Has notado algun cambio en las llantitas? Tambien, qu ests comiendo? Has notado algun cambio a nivel de masa muscular? Lo mas probable no estas ingiriendo la cantidad suficiente de proteinas. Tambien, debes descansar un poco mas los musculos, 6 dias de ejercicio fuerte no es taaan bueno. Capaz que hagas 4 dias fuertes y uno hagas otra actividad, yoga, pilates, caminar, algun deporte etc. Tambien, recuerda que estas empezando, yo comence hace 3 meses y ahora es que veo un leve cambio. Lo mas probable sea la gente quien te diga que te ves diferente y tu no notes nada. Sigue motivado en alcanzar tu meta, no puedes esperar que de la noche a la ma?ana todo se vaya y/o crezca. Sigue ahi, preguntale todo a tu entrenador y si no te convence busca otro a ver que te dice. Cada cuerpo es diferente y todos reaccionamos diferentes a los ejercicios, hay gente que rebaja super rapido y otros se toman una eternidad. Lo esencial para rebajar es quemar mas calorias de las que consumes, para eso necesitas, acelerar el metabolismo, comer saludablemente y ejercitarte y ya vas a ver como te cambia el cuerpo poco a poco.|`|CXKQNHG1aa	Mira para empezar un mes es poco tiempo para q veas resultados y mas si es la 1ra vez q asistes a un gym y empiezas con lo mas basico no t desesperes y continua asi ya q es tardado ste proceso ahora un consejo si quieres bajar d peso y tonificar mas tu cuerpo no hagas ejercicio con mucho pero para eso sirve mas las repeticiones lo q pasa q la mayoria d los instructores t ponen ejercicios para qt pongas como toro para mas tips visita http://www.menshealth.es/  ya q a mi me sirvio un buen sin ir al gym pero siempre y sigas los consejos tal y como stan ahi ok bye.|`|ittLJnnvaa	claro man solo tenes que darle tiempo.  no se saca musculos de un dia para otro.  debes haver mejorado algo solo que como vos te ves el cuerpo todos los dias no sueles notar los cambios porq son lijeros.  puedes buscar alguna dieta que te ayude a agilizar los tramites xD!  no comas esas pastas que vienen con los anabolicos y demas porque te traeran consecuencias no deseadas.|`|tNL5pmKiaa	Lo primero que debes hacer es bajar de peso con esto me refiero a que no hagas muchas pesas o trabajo en aparatos, enfocate a los aparatos cardivasculares, ya que con eso no bajas si no ayudas a fortalecer el musculo con todo y grasa. Mencionas que ocupas la caminadora no trotes camina a un paso rapido porque al trotar ganas condicin fsica pero tu buscas quemar grasa asi que mejor camina (en la caminadoras hay una tabla donde dice el ritmo cardiaco al 65% y me parece que al 85%, trata de mantenerte en el de 65%) si hay escalera electrica en tu gimnasio usala sudas muchisimo es muy buena.  La eliptica tamben sirve muy bien al igual que la escaladora trata de alternar los aparatos no uses los mismos todos los dias y trata de estar en cada a aparato 20 min, no dejes de hacer las abdominales trata de variar los ejercicios de abdominales todo esto es para que tu cuerpo no se acostumbre a lo mismo.

aJfxhJUqaa	Yo te recomiendo reemplazar una de tus comidas diarias, el almuerzo o la cena(recomendable la cena) por fibra como por ejemplo un plato de cereal que contenga lo mas posible de fibra con leche descremada o desnatada, si consumes pan, tratar de consumir solo integral y dejar los jugos o zumos a un lado, cambiarlos por agua, trata de no tener cosas muy ricas en grasa en tu refrigerador para no tener la tentacion fcil, hazte horarios fijos de desayuno, almuerzo y cena, no comas entre comidas y que tu plato fuerte del da sea de un tama?o razonable, yo me compre un plato no muy grande y en ese como todos los das para no pasarme. tu ultima comida debera ser dos o tres horas antes de irte a dormir.  Si te tomas dos vasos de agua bien helada antes de comer tu almuerzo o cena tendrs menos sensacion de hambre.   si lo haces as te garantizo que te funcionara, yo he bajado as esos kilitos que me estaban molestando, en un mes creo que conseguirs bastante si eres ordenado y consecuente contigo mismo, si estas dispuesto a hacer ejercicios las dos cosas se complementarian muy bien aunque aun sin ejercicios los kilitos los puedes perder igual.

Dejar de comer es lo peor que puedes hacer, al contrario si comes 6 veces al dia tu metabolismo se acelera y quema las caloras ms rpido.  2. Dieta balanceada no comer hasta atragantarse  3. Tienes que quemar mas calorias que las que consumes  4. Ejercicio cardiovascular o aerobico mas de 3 veces por semana  5. MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUcha agua todos los dias.

ECHALE GANAS!!!:Cientificamente la terapia es sencilla: farmacos(controlados)un poco de movimiento aerobico sencillo como trotar o caminar rapido*VARIADAS DIETAS DE DESENSO* y cambio de habitos en el transcurso del proceso de perdida de peso.    Estoy aqui para compartir contigo mi humilde conocimiento y las tecnicas que resultaron eficases"  Eso que te ocurre en medicina se llama hiperorexia o aumento exagerado del apetito,y tendria origen en una zona del cerebro llamada hipotalamo que es la responsable de la se?al de stop.  AHORA PRESTA ATENCION:  Bueno yo siempre cuento lo que me funciono (PODRIA SERLE DE UTILIDAD A TI Y A OTROS)  MI PLAN EN SINTESIS:  Aclaro que en ocasiones el medico me reemplazaba la sibutramina en periodos de alternancia con MAZINDOL.  La sibutramina fue desarrollada originalmente para el tratamiento de la depresin, aunque su efecto sobre el sistema nervioso central hizo que creciera el inters por su aplicacin en la obesidad. Se trata de un medicamento que suprime el apetito aumentando la disponibilidad de un neurotransmisor llamado noradrenalina.  Esta clase de frmaco, que en el pas se introdujo en el mercado con el nombre de Aderan, debe ser recetado por un mdico.  Pero no solo saca el apetito desmedido por los hidratos , sino que ademas quema grasas por termogenesis esto da un equilibrio entre saludable manejo de cualquier, dieta ,tornandola raoida y sin esfuerzo aunque algunos adicionan triacana de accion prolongada para complementar la quema de grasas y disolucion(lipolisis) y tisanas de potenciadas hierbas diureticas y laxantes(de origen natural para reducir los efectos colaterales de la hipertencion y eliminar tambien el exeso de lipidos, liquidos y la constipacion.  A mi me funciono de maravillas aunque muchos dicen que la experiencia es intransferible, los amigos que fueron con esta misma doctora siguieron controles y metodos similares y obtubieron resultados favorables  pd: un gran interrogante?existen buenos y malos remedios o gente mal medicada?  segundo interrogante ?que tiene mas efectos colaterales los farmacos citados o el sobrepeso?  ?es bueno ser prejuicioso y decir "medicacion noooooooooo", o es siempre lo mas sano es lo mas operativo en materia de regimenes alimentarios.  pd: he dejado ya la medicacion y no existio el tan temido por muchos efecto rebote(creo que el unico rebote es el que hace uno si viendose bien comienza a comer y entonces se vuelve como pelota rebotina.sin ofender, las dietas ?yo yo? o los pacientes ?yo yo?  Tambien hay que ser menos hipocritas y que nos traten a los gorditos como a cualquier otro enfermo,los deabeticos saben que la insulina tiene efectos colaterales, pero igual se utilixza como complemento a la dieta, y creo que la obesidad no escapa a estos ejemplos.  Suerte  sugerencias:  Y a ponerse en forma con salud y ayuda de un medico sin prejuicios.  REITERO:  Aclaro que en ocasiones el medico me reemplazaba la sibutramina en periodos de alternancia con MAZINDOL Y TRIACANA AP 2MG (acido triodotiroacetico) y la dieta que hice es esta:PRIMEROS 10 DIAS   algunos doctores adieren 30 miligramos de fluoxetina a media ma?ana y a media tarde,o lo usan de remplazo para la intolerancia a la sibutramina.

Lo mejor es ir paso a paso,comiendo sano,hacer ejercicio cardio vascular que es el que mas quema caloras. En la noche puedes comer ensalada verde y atn,recuerda que los carbohidratos no se pueden consumir despus de las 2 de la tarde por que el metabolismo es mas lento.

Con respecto a las areas musculares lo que te puedo decir es que preguntes en el gimnasio por una rutina. Lo otro es que no te frustres, yo llevo 4 meses y apenas ahora estoy empezando a ver los cambios.

There may not be anything to worry about. Wait a few more days, then if you are concerned, go see a doctor. Have you been stressed a lot lately or experienced a large change in weight (lost or gained)? I've heard those things can affect your period.  Good luck!|`|qlpegimQaa	dont worry hunni, during the start of pubity the period fluctuates! it will almost all your life be very odd and come at random moments!! if you havnt had sex then you are defanetly NOT pregnant so you dont have to worry about that!  have a good day hunni and good luck xxxx
zyqvRcz4aa	Well in researching this question, I found out that Wikipedia even has an entry on it!  There is a sexual fetish regarding the drinking of blood, and drinking menstrual blood is a sub-fetish of that.  Some cultures encourage a woman to eat her placenta after she delivers the baby, so I don't believe it would be a problem health and hygiene-wise.  However - here is the important thing - if it squicks *you* (meaning grosses you out) then it's certainly not something you need to agree to do.  Perhaps you could just tell him it's not your fetish and you'd rather skip it?  Is it common? - not particularly - if common is what you meant by normal.|`|gUg300Mmaa	yeah a little wierd.  Also you might want to inform him its not just blood but mucus and uterine lining and blood clots.|`|AA12206602	absolutley not.|`|F7SYIQgyaa	I personally would be a little nervous about anyone asking me to collect my menstral fluid.

Its like he wants to drink blood like a ******* vampire!! eww. i'd feel disturbed if this was my boyfriend, and as the person above put (FUNNY!) you might just want to consider 'collecting' a new one. or like, buy a cup of pig's blood from the butchers then say 'there ya go', and see him slurp it up.. YUM.|`|b068d9d00b0e157fbcf3dda2e7cdd91daa	Considering your other questions, I highly doubt you're serious.|`|p7HYGk1xaa	Hello,,I always say, "everything's good on a RITZ ". But maybe saving it for deer season would be better. I hear that is one of the best sex scent attractants in this world. I know it gets me wound up!!!Heck yeah he's normal,,might even be related!!!|`|2QQb58fHaa	NO not at all, he is either joking or really messed up that is disgusting|`|2HgA7ZUPaa	omg, that's disgusting! No that's not normal!!! That's freaky I would call him a weirdo and dump him...after asking him what the hell he wanted it for.|`|X3EmAfLxaa	heck no|`|OtbIeYzPaa	awkward but if he wants it so bad give him it and mybe he dosent just want it in a cup he wants to get it him self but still ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

I hope you start feeling better soon|`|AA12206602	Well if you're not pregnant there are several reaosn why your period might be delayed,    stress, new medication, weight loss or gain,|`|XWmkpywWaa	All I can think of is stress.

De nada sirve que te atragantes de comida y pienses que con correr unos minutos todo se quema. Es imperativo que comiences a acelerar el metabolismo con ejercicio y comiendo al menos 5 veces al dia. Lo mejor es hacer 3 comidas fuertes y tres meriendas. Para quemar esa grasa de los abdominales necesitas estos tres factores: Hacer ejercicios (incluyendo abdominales)  2. Tener una dieta balanceada y acorde a esa meta (muucha agua!!!).  3. Acelerar el metabolismo para quemar grasa.    Exito y recuerda que no es rapido este proceso, toma tiempo y solo con perseverancia lo vas a lograr.

Dicen que lo dficil no es llegar sino permanecer, el ejercicio es igual puedes dejar de hacerlo pero cuando lo retomes volvers a pasar por el trance del dolor. El dolor se produce porque tus msculos que no ejercitas usualmente estan trabajando (cuando haces ejercicio) y ese deficit que se hace porque no esta acostumbrado es el que provoca el dolor. Sin embargo si t continuas con el ejercicio el dolor disminuir gradualmente hasta el punto de desaparecer porque tus msculos se habrn acostumbrado al ejercicio, lo cual es el mejor remedio, acostumbrar tu cuerpo a hacer ejercicio. Eso si informate de la manera correcta de realizar los ejercicios que elijas, de preferencia con un instructor personal, y recuerda mantener una etapa de calentamiento y estiramiento previa y posteriormente al ejercicio.|`|rJg9qqYmaa	no,no es malo  es mejor no cortar los ejercicios  bruscamente por el dolor  dale mas suave al da siguiente,,, eso pasa de a poco,espera que los msculos se acostumbren, y vayan soportandolo,,  mientras te vas acostumbrando  mucha suerte!!

Mira debes saber que..  El virus responsable de las verrugas genitales se llama virus del papiloma humano (VPH), el cual puede producirlas en el pene, la vulva, la uretra, la vagina, el cuello uterino y alrededor del ano.    La infeccin con el VPH alrededor de los genitales es comn, aunque la mayora de las personas son asintomticas. No obstante, incluso si la persona NO tiene sntomas, debe recibir tratamiento para evitar complicaciones y la diseminacin de la afeccin a otros.    Existen ms de setenta tipos diferentes de VPH. Varios tipos estn asociados con verrugas genitales, mientras que otros estn asociados con verrugas comunes o verrugas planas en otros lugares de la piel.    El VPH prolifera sin problema en las reas genitales hmedas. Las verrugas en las partes genitales externas se reconocen fcilmente, ya que son lesiones levantadas, de coloracin carnosa que se pueden presentar solas o en racimos. Si no reciben tratamiento, las verrugas se pueden agrandar rpidamente, tomando una apariencia "similar a una coliflor".    En las mujeres, el VPH puede invadir la vagina y el cuello uterino. Estas verrugas son planas y no son fcilmente visibles sin el uso de procedimientos especiales. Dado que el VPH puede conducir a cambios cancergenos y cambios precancerosos en el cuello uterino, es importante que esta afeccin se diagnostique y se trate. Las citologas vaginales son necesarias para detectar el VPH u otros cambios anormales relacionados con este virus. De otro lado, el hecho de tener el virus del herpes y el VPH dejan a la persona en riesgo particular de sufrir cncer cervical.    Los siguientes factores ponen a una persona en alto riesgo de desarrollar verrugas genitales y otras complicaciones del VPH:    * Tener mltiples compa?eros sexuales  * Desconocer si alguien con quien se ha tenido una relacin sexual tiene una enfermedad de transmisin sexual  * Iniciacin temprana de la actividad sexual  * Consumo de alcohol y tabaco  * Estrs y otras infecciones virales (como VIH o herpes) al mismo tiempo    Bueno.. espero que te halla sido util esa respuesta.. pero no te olvides es importante ir a un medico dermatolo.. para que veas que tratatamiento le puedes aplicar.. Suerte.. chau.. Salu2!!|`|NLzcU0n8aa	Esta un poco elevado el diagnostico de VPH, no es imposible pero tambn es muy dificil que sea.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Natural tanning is a defense response of your skin to cellular damage caused by exposure to ultraviolet light, which is a large ingredient in regular sunlight. The more ultraviolet you are exposed to, the more melanin your skin makes in defense, which is the active ingredient in a tan. The more melanin, the darker the tan, the more protection from further damage from ultraviolet light. However, tanning can increase the likelihood of developing a skin cancer from the damage caused. Or, your skin can become leathery and hard from scarring as it heals from the damage. The safest way is to use chemical sprays to achieve the same color effect. Light tanning, brief exposures to the natural sun, is mostly NOT harmful provided it is within the capacity of your skin to maintain control. Getting a sunburn IS harmful and can result in scarring and the leathery texture as a result. The "best" way is subjective and a matter of preference with appropriate weighing of the risks involved.|`|AA11900069	Fake it!

z0iTOf88aa	have you let your doctor know that you suffer from anxiety??  You probably should have done so before anything was prescribed to you.    Just like with ANY medications, there are always side effects/risks involved and all pharmaceutical companies by law have to put in writing ALL of the POSSIBLE side effects.  Every kind of birth control reacts very differently with each person because everyone has a different gentic make-up so you won't know if it makes your anxiety any worse/better until you try it for yourself - I've been on some pills that I haven't had any emotional/mental side effect (but didn't take away menstrual cramps) and been on many pills that gave me anxiety/depression.  Ultimately, that could just mean for me, that oral contraceptives aren't the greatest idea but they work for many many people.|`|AA11746917	I've been on them for several months and have experienced zero side effects.

AA11434633	Your BMI (Body Mass Index) is actually 21.5, which is ideal.    Type the details of your weight, height and age into the boxes on the following page ... and click that you're a female and you'll see that it shows the same result as I've typed.  (Your weight in pounds is 125 if you're not sure how to work it out. ... 8 stones is 112 lbs, plus the extra 13 that you said you weighed.)

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Artificial sweeteners are toxins to the body and cause lots of problems.  There are 92 known side effects of Aspartame for example.  The FDA has this information and refuses to ban sweeteners using this because the FDA is not about health, but big business.    Go to:  www.myaspartameexperiment.com  and look at what one woman did on her own to see what happens to animals that eat that junk.  She found what the FDA already knows and has the pictures to prove it after a 2 year study.    Artificial sweeteners cause your appetite to increase and has NO value in regard to weight loss.  Look at all the heavy people drinking diet drinks.  In fact, diet drinks cause the same insulin spike in your body as does sugar.  When this happens and there is no sugar to oxidize, the cells insulin receptors become resistant.  This contributes heavily to diabetes type 2.

Try drinking 100% juice instead.  It's better for you, and you won't be putting harmful saccharide into your stomach and intestines.

Some prefer outdoorsy things like hiking or yard work while others are more sporty- if that floats your boat, try to look for leagues in your area.

It's hard I know.  I've been there so many times.  I did good for so long, lost 35 lbs, and kept up with it, then it all went down hill.

Each shake should be 40-50 grams of protein. usually 2 scoops of the protein. Will say on the container how many grams of protein there is per serving.    Creatine should be taken while working out or immediatly after a workout. serving size is usually 2 scoops in 16oz of water. Creatine is totally safe and yes you do need to drink a lot of water when using it but it really doesnt matter if you do or dont. They say you should so that your liver can more easily deal with it but i use it constantly and have never had any problems.|`|27a97f47d8c99e2837e4d1a9c3b49347aa	uhhh iv tried many supplements i wouldnt try creatine you have to have a GREAT intake in water and creatine is only going to give you "fake" muscle which is water retention in your muscle compartments and plus my best bet would be about a gram of protien per pound of body weight so if you wiegh about 150 you wanna take 150g-300g of protien and eat good carbs like bagels,potatoes, ect....and up you calorie intake by alot all this and low reps of heavy wieight and good work out routines will make you gain wieght right after you work out is the BEST time to take WHEY! good luck :-)

AA12219057	Ok, answering your questions one at a time:    - www.dreamviews.com (My name is Holland on the dream views forms, if you need to get in contact with me) and www.ld4all.com (I'm Harley on that one) are great sites that have helped me dramatically. There are some books like Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming that helped me a lot too.    -I started in June, and I've had three lucid dreams. However, they have been very short, as I am still new to this. The time depends form person to person. But I can say that you will need deep concentration and will to achieve lucid dreaming. And before you even think about lucid dreaming, you need to be able to remember at least one dream a night. I've gotten to the point of 2-4 dreams a night.    -I'm not sure if hectic lifestyles affect your goal to lucid dream. Stress can make it harder, however. And you need a little time in your day to read and study lucid dreaming so you can achieve it.|`|e26a557a9ad5b63bf3480b4165307199aa	Hi,  Just to let you know I have a really hectic and stressfull lifestyle and I never could control my dreams before but then I got really stressed out and it got really hectic and I started to be able to do it.

0203ca5aca6dc4a7fbeeabf78806eceaaa	It sounds like you don't have a studio in your area.   I've been doing bikram yoga for 3.5 years, and have my own opinion about the heat.   I believe that the heat should enhance your practice rather than hinder it.  When the room is a nice 104 like it should be it's lovely.   When it gets to about 50% humidity and feels much hotter it can be cumbersome.  Then again, I"m not a size zero.  So, in my opinion as long as the room is warm you'll be fine.   Unlike Ashtanga, Bikram doesn't create as much heat internally so you might want to go for a run first or wear warm clothing as you practice in a cooler room.           Breathing should be a 6-second inhale followed by a 6-second exhale.   For the belly down postures they recommend what they call 80-20 breathing.   Inhale completely, then exhale 20%, inhale 20% and keep using the top 20% of the lung capacity.  You'll find a lot of questions answered on www.bikramyoga.com

I feel pretty digusted with myself and now have to worry about hiding the scars.    For me, the regret alone and how its made me feel is enough to (hopefully) stop me from self-harming again anytime soon.  Try not to beat yourself up as it could just be a one-off slip up.  Try to take the positve from the situation-look at what led you to self harm and see if you can think of ways to control the situation if you were to feel like that again.    Use your support network-see friends/family more at the moment.  I had to see my GP anyway soon but will be open with her about my self-harm.  Maybe she'll decide I do need more support or different medication, and that will be a positive thing.

(its worth a try)    i know only to well the feeling that your having, which is why im trying to write a poetry book on the "labels" that "we" so wrongly have, hoping to bring light to the people who think we are "crazy" when its really them that makes us worse but hurting us!!!!

You can be a strong person if you put your mind to it and think about how proud of yourself you will feel if you don't harm yourself.  You'll be winning then and be stronger for it.**|`|hpr9yu4Iaa	yeah..I think you need help. talk to someone and tell them what u r going through you know jux let it vent..dont get that thing stuck in ur chest cuz that will make you to cut urself again..or go to the gym or exercise..do yoga..taichi or meditation this will surely relief ur stress. also eat healthy food. get a good rest 8 hrs or more..Also everytime u wake up from bed say 100 things u are grateful of..like for example I am grateful that I am still alive. I am grateful that I'm in my room..anything. then u will see the difference. It will not stop stress but it will prevent or reduce it.

There are also support groups that you can join..    http://www.twloha.com/page.php?id=11    also, there is a group on facebook called "to write love on her arms." its a huge group and i think that it helps a lot of people.     whenever you think about the negative things that make you want to hurt yourself, try to push the thoughts away and make a list of all the positive things that you have going for you in your life. good luck |`|aN0jkPuxaa	Sometimes people arent perfect:)  It happened, try to put it behind you and take the next day fresh as a person who doesnt self harm anymore. It doesnt mean anything other than thats where you were at the time. Perhaps a strategy will help you , like "next time I want to s/h I will xx instead"... Is there a friend or family member you could telephone when you feel a crisis? If not there maybe a helpline or an online forum you could try.    Your question is phrased in a very positive way, recognise the strength you have, decide what your future will be and LIVE IT.

Honey, if you've never had an orgasm, you've never ***. And by what you've said, I'm certain you've never had an orgasm because when you do, it's fantastic!    You need to be comfortable with your own body, and sometimes it takes a while. If I were you, I'd invest in a vibrator and go at it alone.

HnPqlbStaa	Generally, the clitoris and the surrounding tissue will swell as it engorges with blood flow to the area.    According to this website:    http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/...    When a woman becomes sexually aroused, both the glans and the shaft fill with blood and increase in size. The glans can double in diameter. There is no evidence that a larger clitoris means more intense sexual arousal.    As erotic stimulation continues and orgasm approaches, the clitoris becomes less visible as it is covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. This swelling is designed to protect the clitoris from direct contact, which, for some women, can be more irritating than pleasurable. It moves out again when the stimulation stops.    So, it sounds to me like you are perfectly normal as long as you are enjoying yourself.    |`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	It's Clitoris actually, but I have never heard of that before.

Make sure your clothes are clean and your shoes aren't gross.  If they keep teasing you, ask someone you KNOW you can trust about it.  If they agree that there's still a funky odor originating from you, you might want to see a doctor about it.  There are illnesses and conditions which can make a person smell bad no matter what they do, and you might need treatment.  (If the person you trust tells you these people are full of it, trust them and ignore the snipes of your schoolmates.  The other thing people your age are known for is being nasty.)|`|i3Rqq1hgaa	Im not a girl but I take showers with shower gel, use bar deoderant on my underarms and spray axe on my skin and shirt and a lil cologne and i smell good.|`|BHIiO22taa	ok. worst case scenario: you smell bad. some things you can do:  * clinical strength deodorant can be bought OTC now  * breath mints  * don't smoke!! it stays on the clothes  * a quick spritz of a subtle body spray (from stores like Bath and Body Works) before you leave the house  It is hard when you start developing and your body changes and smells different.

You will gain a heck of a lot of weight if you're not excercising your butt off.  It's got way too many calories, loads of salt, and no vitamins.  OK, so you need to save money.  Use the noodles, that's fine, they make a good, cheap base, but don't eat JUST noodles.  Get some veggies (also cheap if they're in season), carrots, celery, peas, beans, potatoes, mushrooms, etc. to add flavor, bulk, and vitamins.  Not only will this make it more healthy, it'll also keep you full longer.  Watch the meat sales and stock up on meat when it's supper cheap.  Look on the web for other things you can do with Ramen inexpensively, http://www.ramenlicious.com/index.html is one such site.  No matter how cheap the noodles are, they're not worth it if you ruin your health with them.|`|EsJOMez1aa	I tell this to anyone with similar questions about weight loss and diet~  Diets, pills, drinks, and gimmicks aren't going to help you. They just want to play on peoples emotions and insecurities so they can make a quick buck. Extreme weight gain takes months, so It could take months to lose it, and twice as much energy to lose. It's hard, takes willpower and determination to succeed. Here's how to do it with no guesswork, just a dose of common sense and good judgment to do whats right for you to live a long happy healthy life~here's how~  OK, the real true way the body was created, to maintain your weight true to your height and build is to....    1) Eat as much unprocessed organic foods as possible. Lay off the prepackaged, starchy, homogenised, refined foods. Fresh fruit, fresh veggies, whole grains, and get as much protein from vegetation. If you must eat meat, eat organic. Or buy from kosher markets. Drink 2 liters of bottled spring water. Fiji water is the best. It might seem more expensive at first, but think of it this way. Would you rather pay into aggravating medical bills stemming from your unhealthy lifestyle, or spend a little more serving you and you family healthy foods your bodies intended to have since the creation of mankind?  Think about it. There wasn't a whole lot of overweight couch potato settlers. They worked for what they had. Physical labor, for meager earnings, meager food rationed. yet, they survived. They were their average weight. There was not diabetes, or any strange diseases we see today. Don't believe me? Google it. Which brings me to number 2...    2) Exercise as much as you can. Even if it means short simple walks daily at first. Before all the modernisation of the world we walked, lifted, stooped, knelt, and occasionally ran. The ratio to exercise is burn off at least over half of what you consumed the previous day. Normal brain functions, stress, everyday activities besides exercise burns off the rest, and doesn't deposit as fat.    If you aren't healthy enough for physical activities, I urge you to cut out the prepackaged foods, and corn syrup laden drinks, and eat more natural foods. I guarantee you will lose weight from just doing that, than relying on herbal teas or nutrition supplements you found that say "AS SEEN ON TV"    Be well

ab2280166f5d5bab837bbca6f17252e1aa	First the bad news, loosing this amount of weight in such a short time is bad for you. What you have lost is muscle and water, you still carry the same amount of fat so percentage wise you are actually fatter. Sorry but the weight will go back on. Now the good news, the way to loose weight is in your head, you have just proved to yourself that it can be done. The Maximumin weight you can loose each week is two pounds, this level of weight loss ensures that what you are loosing is fat. Two pounds should be easy considering what you have just done. Be sensible with your food and you can do it, two pounds may not sound a lot but it soon adds up, good luck.|`|MBget6pdaa	half stone in 10days thats so fast introduce foods u like back in slowly|`|qfyrLFVhaa	eat ONLY fruits and veg for about 5 days, then start eating normally again|`|AA12299134	I'm not sure what your 'usual' eating habits were, but if you now start eating healthily, the weight will stay away.  Look to eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day to keep your body full of minerals and nutrients, and drink plenty of water to keep your digestion good and your metabolism high.  Also see if you can take around 30 minutes of exercise a day (walking, running, swimming, cycling etc) to burn off any calories.  Do that, and it should keep the weight off very nicely.  Your body will also thank you for it if you keep that kind of diet going.  You will feel so much better.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Aaah - if we knew that, we could bottle it and make a fortune.

AA12365277	I am an ex-smoker.    No amount of discussing the matter with your mother, or arguing with her will change her on it.    And she does not smoke more because of you, or anything you said or did.  Smoking more to relieve stress is just a temporary phenomenom for addicted smokers - she'll revert to her normal usage down the road.    Accept your mother as a smoker, and find a way to deal with it until or unless she is ready to try to quit (and she may never reach that point).  Accept that you are not going to change her.    It is the toughest addiction.|`|0a1d459632403dead23c7cca0a116aa8aa	I feel for you. It is hard living with a smoker. You mother is only smoking because of her addiction. It may seem like she is selfish and not willing to change for you, but she has an extreme addiction to tobacco. I suggest addressing her your concerns. Tell her how much you love her. Tell her that you don't want her dying from lung cancer. Inform her of the long term and short term dangers of smoking. Tell her that you have sensitive lungs that easily get irritated by cigarette smoke. I think the best time to tell her this is maybe out at dinner. Invite her to a nice family place, and discuss this with her. I hope your relationship with your mother remains stable and happy. I wish you best of luck. I hope your mother quits smoking.|`|AA11695611	She is a grown women..if she wants to smoke, its her biz!|`|5a02e70c01f0905b71555c0e098fa2dcaa	Talk to her calmly and if you cant tell her to think about herself and the things shes  missing out on.  maybe she's missing something.

She do have the example of her mom right in front of her and still she is continued her habit. I think you have to take her for the counselling. Before that you can try the other alternatives such as some threatens that if she did not leave the smoking you will do or you will not do this or that. Other alternative is that you may asked her to reduce her smoking stepwise. Lesser and lesser by 10% per week. Wish you all the best!!!!
AA11944347	pretty much everyone was partially correct in one way or another....the way it breaks down is this. in the average male, alcohol is broken down at the rate of half of an ounce per hour. the guy who listed it as 12 ounce per hour was thinking in terms of beer. alcohol breaks down like this a shot glass is much smaller than a glass of beer because it has a much higher alcohol content. a regular shot of...lets say vodka is about 40%-70% depending on the brand so lets say a person finds a brand that's 50% alcohol. 2 shots of that vodka would add up to 1 ounce of alcohol consumed out of the 2 ounces of vodka. Wine is about 11% alcohol and is served in about an 8 ounce serving, making the ammount of alcohol consumed 0.88 ounces.....almost an entire ounce per glass. beer on the other hand is about 5% alcohol and is served in usually in a 12 ounce glass which means that with every glass of beer, you've ingested 0.6 ounces of alcohol...a little more than half an ounce. ingesting 1 ounce of alcohol will raise your BAC (blood alcohol content) to 0.04 (think of it as 0.02 per beer or shot of hard liquor). so if one were to drink 4 shots of liquor or beer, their BAC would be a 0.08 which is a DUI if you get pulled over.  someone with a normally functioning liver and who is not an alcoholic will be able to break that alcohol down at 1/2 oz per hour meaning if you've have 4 beers it would take 4 hours for your BAC to go back down to zero to be able to pass a breathalyzer or a blood BAC check. as far as the other guy claiming it stays in your system and is testable for a longer period than that......breaking down alcohol produces byproducts in the body which are urinated out. the tests he's talking about don't specifically test to see if there's alcohol in your system....it checks if there's possibly been alcohol in your system by checking for byproducts.  Usually all traces are gone within a 24 hour period if your healthy and hydrating yourself properly. that's why people are on parole can still drink and get away with it, because it flushes out of your system quickly as opposed to something like marijuana. Water will not sober you up water doesn't change how much alcohol is in your blood stream, it just changes how much fluid is in the body. if you quickly drink 5 shots of vodka and plan on getting in a car an  hour later...all the water in the world isn't going to make you pass a brethalyzer or the blood BAC check. people give others water at a bar in order to try to get them to kill time by drinking something that's not alcoholic|`|07ebfcf7f12187f817c14316a1789100aa	It depends on a lot of things, such as your body mass and the speed of your metabolism.

Zelnorm is a medicine used for the short-term treatment of women who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation (hard stools or difficulty passing stools) as their main bowel problem.  IBS is a disorder that interferes with the normal functions of the large intestine (colon).  Symptoms may include cramps, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea.  The cause of IBS is not known.    Zelnorm works by increasing the movement of stools through the bowels.  For those patients who are helped, Zelnorm reduces pain and discomfort in the abdominal area, bloating, and constipation.    Zelnorm is not a cure for IBS and does not work for all women who use it.  FDA does not have evidence that Zelnorm is effective in men with IBS.|`|888716a5ec7be175b2fdd4795cdc603faa	It's a medication for treating irritable bowel syndrome.|`|AA10311936	HM...I think it's either a heart burn reliever or a sleeping pill.

6b2f3a2a0fdcb975952b6ab893fff051aa	Obesity surgery-like gastric bypass /lap band surgery / stomach stapling and gastrectomy have become very common now. My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare. Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India.     I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as obesity surgery and weight loss surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. As a doctor I personally believe that your Obesity surgery can be easily handled in India.    Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost Obesity surgery in India. Indian corporate hospitals are comparable to hospitals anywhere in the world. In fact, India has medical facilities that are comparable with the USA, UK and Canada. India offers World Class Medical Facilities, comparable with any of the western countries. India has state of the art Hospitals and the best medical experts. With the best infrastructure, the best possible Medical facilities, accompanied with the most competitive prices, you can get the treatment done in India at the lowest prices.      http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.|`|0f9b1610998dfe46ddb7f480dff67703aa	Just last week my sister -in-law died from that.She got a bad infection and they were going to do surgery and remove the band and she had a major heart-attack.I hate to scare you, but I do know there are risks and you need to really consider them.Best wishes..|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	Here is some info about the procedure and the side effects, etc:  http://www.lapband.com/lapband/portal.do  http://www.obesitylapbandsurgery.com/tec...  http://www.columbiasurgery.org/divisions...

Requires that the patient is morbidly obese, and agrees to participate in medical, psychological evaluations. Follow-up studies must fit the parameters of the FDA guidelines. The Lap-Band procedure is now being performed in many states.   27  What are the risk factors in LAP-BAND surgery?  A.  Any gastric operation for obesity is major surgery and carries with it the risks that would go with any complex operation. Athough the LAP-BAND procedure is minmally invasive surgery, it is not without its own risks. Infections can develop around the stomach band or at the site where the reservoir is placed under the skin. In such an event, a patient would be required to stay in the hospital a few extra days for the infection to clear. Bleeding or injury to the spleen, may require conversion to an open procedure. The access port or the band may leak and may need to be replaced. While the risk of dying during the operation is small (about 0.5 in 1000), there is a slight risk because of either a heart attack or a life-threatening blood clot passing into the lungs.|`|AA10236535	"In the USA, the cost of Lap-Band surgery can range from $17,000 to $30,000"  http://www.aboutlapbandsurgery.info/lap-...

fd35cf1fc833df7da42b566e585fb4dfaa	from:  http://ca.askmen.com/love/love_tip_200/2...  http://www.jackinworld.com/qa/qasem.html    Of all the various aspects of the male human body, few are as variable from individual to individual as semen. The color, texture, and quantity  not to mention the force of ejaculation  vary greatly. Based on outward appearance we are all amazingly similar: virtually everyone has eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth in the same place. But semen just doesn't work that way.   Just like penis size, ejaculation volume and force are highly variable from individual to individual. Most guys want to ejaculate more semen with more force.  If you've done exercises like Kegels For Men, yes, it may have increased your distance  but probably not your volume. There's a *huge* variation from person to person with regard to ejaculation force as well as volume, and neither has anything to do with anything important (such as having children).    A lot of guys would love it if they could make like one of the characters in Scary Movie and ejaculate so much that they plaster their girlfriends against the ceiling. And although that won't likely be happening anytime soon, it's believed that wheat germ increases seminal output. Bon apptit.  (Butter's note: I only tried it once and it thickened my load like I've rarely seen before. Eat with oatmeal for better results)    Amino acids, if taken regularly, are generally believed to increase ejaculate fluid. On the other hand, zinc seems to improve both the amount of sperm produced as well as the sperm's ability to move spontaneously and independently. Together with amino acids, this will increase normal sperm count and volume significantly.   Amino acids are believed to increase ejaculate fluid (not the amount of actual sperm necessarily) if taken regularly. Some amino acids include:    L-ARGININE HCL  Studies show sperm and semen volume doubles, fertility improves (even among men with low sperm counts or poor sperm motility), and sperm health and activity increase with supplementation. Arginine is found in high concentrations in nuts and seeds like peanuts and almonds. It can also be found in chocolate and raisins. Some Natural Sources: Nuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, chocolate, popcorn, raisins, brown rice, carob, gelatin desserts, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and protein rich foods.     L-LYSINE  Researchers find that this amino acids plus zinc increases sperm produced, stimulates testosterone production, and improves semen quality.    EPIMEDIUM SAGITTATUM  Sometimes called "horny goat weed," this botanical boosts libido and testosterone levels for greater sperm production for a strong ejaculation.    ZINC OXIDE  Has been shown to increase number of sperm and sperm motility by 80% to 200% by aiding testosterone synthesis.    L-CARNITINE  This amino acid is found in high concentrations in healthy sperm. Proven to significantly increase the percentage of highly motile sperm.    CATUABA BARK  Brazilian herb that strengthens the libido, and nourishes the entire male reproductive system.    PUMPKIN SEED  Supports prostate health and hormonal production. While they may not readily increase sperm volume, they do enhance prostate health and testosterone production.     MACA  Legendary South American botanical proven to promote libido, potency and energy.    Ginseng Y  ohimbe bark  Vitamin C, E  Magnesium  (Butter's note: Lecithin added daily increases amount, not thickness)    Zinc has been shown to improve both the amount of sperm you produce and the sperm's ability to move spontaneously and independently. Coupled with amino acids (see above), this will increase sperm volume significantly.  (Butter's note: Not as miraculous as they make it sound, but regular zinc intake (50mgs a day) does increase quantity somewhat.)    Whatever a pill company's claims are, you can probably do just as well with zinc and lecithin supplements. (Use zinc supplements in moderation; too much zinc intake can be dangerous.) For some guys, these nutrients do have a noticeable effect on ejaculation volume, and they're a lot cheaper and easier to get. In general, stay away from mail-order pills sold by less-than-reputable companies; you really don't know what's in them, and their claims are almost always untrue or at least greatly exaggerated.    PC Exercises:  While Kegel exercises can help you last longer, they can also aid in increasing sperm volume. There are a host of exercises you can do to keep your penis in great shape and shoot like a champion.   (Butter's note: PC muscle exercises have proven to help reduce prostate troubles in advancing age, but I have yet to see improvements in my ejaculate's volume through this method)    Frequency of sexual activity also contributes to volume -- although only to a certain degree. If you abstain for a day or two, you'll certainly produce more sperm than you would ejaculating every few hours. But any longer than this one- to two-day timeframe, and you won't see much of a difference, as semen reservoirs will have stopped building up a supply.  (Butter's note: True, the body will evacuate excess semen through urine & etc. so abstinence over 3 or 4 days will not continue increase of quantity. Usually, 2 or 3 days should be enough to reach maximum potential... but there are exceptions!)     And for those of you who wrote in asking if semen is a good source of protein, its protein content is roughly equivalent to that found in the egg white of a large egg. So you're probably best off sticking with the eggs.     Consistency of semen isn't very consistent; you've probably no|`|b63253f4ab9c6615156c7c13b2a42748aa	You can produce more sperms by producing more testosterone, such as by working out more (especially sprints, and other things that get you out of breath).

fd35cf1fc833df7da42b566e585fb4dfaa	Masturbation Frequency:  http://www.jackinworld.com/misc/faqtree1...    How often does the average male masturbate?  It depends on a lot of factors, the most important being age. For an 18-year-old male, a rough average is once a day or so. This is slightly higher for younger teenagers  maybe 10 or 12 times a week, and slightly lower for older people. You might be surprised by how often adult men masturbate  even happily married men.    I think I'm addicted to masturbation. Is that possible?  It is, although many, many people think they're addicted when they're really just doing what comes naturally. For more on this topic, read the article Is Masturbation Addictive?(http://www.jackinworld.com/library/artic...    How can I masturbate less often, or quit altogether?

065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	Just make certain that you haven't washed them after you've worn them.    Each of us has our own particular aroma, and to men, it's an aphrodisiac.  Accept it.  And heck, if he's using your scent to remind himself of you when he pleases himself, that not only OK, but is very flattering to you as well.      In fact, if you and your bf were going to be away from one another for any length of time (business trip, school, work, military deployment, for example), then slipping a pair of your unwashed undies into a resealable plastic bag and leaving it for him or tucking it into his luggage is a great way to remind him of you.|`|bbd55faea8f4d9f823f86c1d92fa325caa	Yes we love your scent so give him a pair that you've worn for a day and haven't washed. Also, if you could find it in your heart to send a pair to a soldier in iraq that would be very sweet. :) lol.

3a378c3df605b86abc4379827b4143a9aa	you obviously never heard of someone called as plastic surgeon,believe me you can have your mole removed with d faintest of scars consult your doctor and ask for a plastic surgery referral.........i kno this because i'm planning to be a plastic surgeon one day.|`|fb45aa39fc9300c79143be72cfb997b0aa	Get rid of it!  For crying out loud, moles can be pre-cancerous.  Would you rather live with a scar or die with a mole?    Hey get it removed, and then tell people you got the scar crashing through a police barricade while protesting an appearance by George Bush in your home town.  You'll be a hero!|`|301f4ed7992c801fa9375227573f186faa	Certain moles can be cancerous. These ones have irregular color patterns and soft, ragged edges.  Has your mole grown larger over your lifetime? If it has, it's going to keep growing, and you should get it taken off before it leaves an even longer scar.   I'd need a picture of the mole to say anything definite, but it's probably not as bad as you seem to think. If the skin is smooth, of an even color, and the mole's edges are even or neatly defined, it might even be charming. I'm not joking, here. Since it's not actually on your face, but around the neck where people are used to seeing dark-colored objects like hair, it's probably not conspicuous or shocking. Of course, if it's raised up round (more like a tumor than a mole) it really does need to go.  If you do decide to get it taken off, do not, do not, do not skimp on the surgeon. Get someone who knows what he's doing, otherwise the scar could actually reshape nearby areas of your face.   As for the scar, you might end up looking like you got shanked in the throat. It would make for some interesting party banter, but do you really want to be answering "What happened? Did someone slit your throat?" to every fifth person for the rest of your life? The mole might be better.   Do you have your ears pierced? Any problems with scarring in the area? If you have any other scars, does their color contrast with your skin? If so, that's a predictor for the scar under your jaw.   Good luck with whatever you decide.

6c7ed632be2f88db09c8d63827afcdb1aa	Effectivement, une exposition rpte  certains produits peut provoquer une raction de rejet du corps (en industrie, cela arrive avec les personnes qui travaillent dans les laiteries -> allergie au lait, ou au ma?on -> allergie au ciment... et cela ne va pas sans poser des problmes).    Il est donc recommander de ce protger les zones exposes lorsque l'on est en contact frquent et rpt avec un mme produit (main, voix respiratoires...).  Les produits mnagers sont des produits chimiques, contenant des composs actifs, qui sont pas trs bon pour la sant, et qui peuvent donc gnrer des allergies (rougeurs, dmangeaisons, eczma...) -> c'est une raction de dfense de notre corps.    Aprs, je ne sais pas s'il y a un lien entre les produits mnagers et les allergies aux vgtaux (type framboisier...). Par contre, je sais que prendre une douche juste avant d'aller dans le jardin (cueillir des haricots, framboises...) n'est pas une bonne chose car la peaux scrtent "une protection" que l'on retire en se lavant (valable pour une exposition au soleil galement).|`|viqTxLHKaa	Il est certain que les produits mnagers sont agressifs pour bien dcaper. Donc un usage prolong expose l'piderme  des  formes de br?lures ou irritations superficielles et des risques de  dsquamation. Ainsi l'allergie reste possible. Mais attention ce n'est pas rellement une allergie au sens propre du terme mais les consquences d'un abus prolong de produit irritant. Nuance! L'allergie tant une intolrance particulire.

Je parle d'allergie de contact.|`|e08be3a7e24b1934e3b57b181fecfd52aa	Oui je le pense, c'est pour cela qu'il faut absolument mettre des gants pour certains types de produits comme la Javel.

Passe um fio dental entre os dentes e depois bocheche fortemente (se quiser bochechar com uma pitada de bicarbonato de sdio, ser mais eficiente)      Depois gargareje para lavar a sua lngua, especialmente a parte do fundo.     Tenha uma alimenta??o rica em cenoura, ma?? e outros alimentos fibrosos. Eles auxiliam na promo??o de uma limpeza total na parte dos dentes que fica na linha das gengivas.      Para diminuir o mau hlito oriundo de excesso de bebida ou do cigarro, procure bochechar trs vezes ao dia com gua e lim?o (sem a?car ou dietticos). O lim?o tem cidos que anulam os odores tpicos dessas substancias.      Beba muita gua.      Visite seu dentista pelo menos duas vezes por ano.     Se tomar essas providencias, com certeza o hlito deve melhorar... agora pelo amor de Deus, nada de querosene...|`|bdd5826a6800474ffdac98e299408f6aaa	Oi Ladysorrow, este tipo de pergunta  uma armadilha...quem fez isso com vc , que dio!!!

Os vegetais nao o produzem pela simples razao de que nao possuem hemacias. ELES SAO SIMPLESMENTE INCAPAZES DE PRODUZIR B12.  IMPOSSIVEL , PODEM ESPERNEAR OS VEGETARIANOS ESTRITOS.  a mesma coisa que esperar que um cachorro produza clorofila e saia fazendo fotossintese. No entanto ,  verdade que as necessidades dee fontes animais sao pequenas (bem menores do que o que normalmente costumamos comer), exceto em criancas menores de 1 ano ( nesse caso , o leite materno  suficiente para suprir as necessidades)    segundo: existe uma coisa , que muitos vegetarianos estritos desconhecem , chamada BIODISPONIBILIDADE. Esse termo se refere "a capacidade que certo elemento tem , ao ser ingerido , de ser absorvido . Exemplo: o feijao  riquissimo em ferro. Mas nao  uma boa fonte de ferro para o ser humano. Na natureza , o ferro  encontrado quimicamente na forme de on ferrico ou ferroso. Os vegetais sao ricos em ferro tipo ferrico , esse tipo tem uma biodisponibilidade de , no maximo ,10 a 15 % no ser humano. O tipo ferroso , ou ferro heme,  encontrado nas fontes animais (repetindo : pode ser leite ou ovos) , tendo uma biodisponibilidade bem maior ,  de 30 a 50 %. Mais uma vez , o ferro  apenas um exemplo , existem outros.     Terceiro: qualquer fonte animal  rica em proteinas. Existem fontes vegetais tambem ricas em proteinas, mas nem de longe tanto quanto na fonte animal. Apesar de os vegetais serem capazer de suprir A MAIORIA das proteinas necessarias ao ser humano , pra que isso seja feito a pessoa precisa ter uma certa instrucao sobre nutricao , ou acompanhamento de um nutricionista . Isso porque , como os vegetais em geral sao mais ricos em carbohidratos e glicidios , existe uma certa tendencia " a pessoa despreparada , ao optar por ser vegetariano , desenvolver desnutrticao proteica - mas nao calorica - por simples desinformacao de quais vegetais sao boas fontes de proteinas (nao se baseie em livros escritos por pessoas que voce nem sabe quem sao. Nem em livros psicografados. Nem em mim , na verdade. Procurem um nutricionista competente)|`|40c6ae177718f873df559febdf610381aa	Acho q n?o, mas  preciso ser feita uma dieta rica em protenas.

WKixUxU3aa	Tratar micose  algo complicado, pois o tratamento  demorado e deve ser seguido  risca. Voc tem certeza do que tens  micose? Pode ser que n?o seja. S um dermatologista poder te dar essa resposta e te prover o melhor tratamento.  Se for micose mesmo, siga  risca o tratamento. Do jeito que voc descreveu, a doen?a j est se espalhando, e pode ser que seu tratamento n?o seja somente colocar uma pomada anti-mictica nas reas afetadas (se for micose mesmo), talvez seja necessrio medica??o oral para auxiliar a pomada. N?o desanime, ok? O tratamento  um pouco longo, siga-o at o fim, e n?o o pare s por que voc aparentemente est livre do problema. Isso s vai fazer com que a doen?a volte, e com mais for?a.  Outra dica:  ferva todos os seus tens que voc usa, tais como roupa de cama e pe?as ntimas, pra voc n?o se reinfectar e nem infectar algum. Fa?a a mesma coisa com os de sua filha, e nunca passe nada no local por conta prpria, pois s piora, ou mascara o problema, e a o problema ressurgir no futuro, e bem pior.  Leve uma vida mais saudvel, pois o estresse pode piorar sua condi??o, e cuidado com doen?as que possam baixar sua imunidade, como resfriados e gripes, pois muitas vezes voc tem o fungo em sua prpria microbiota (popularmente conhecida como "flora bacteriana") e ele pode se aproveitar pra se manifestar nesses casos.  E evite contato com lugares estranhos, onde voc possa se contagiar com fungos, e se vir algum que voc suspeita ter micose, mantenha distancia, e n?o deixe sua filha por perto.  J ia esquecendo: N?O COCE as reas infectadas, ok? Pois se voc fizer isso, e depois co?ar uma parte do seu corpo que n?o est com o problema, a micose vai se espalhar.|`|S2FVuaJLaa	use leo de travao|`|0034c93122ebe108d6e71135ddd9ff3daa	Meu bem, tem a miconazol.

683148e9be85ad9da64da81650774d21aa	Bonjour !  J'ai arrt une premire fois pendant trois ans, puis j'ai repris un an, et de nouveau j'ai arrt il y a un an et demi maintenant.    J'ai utilis la prmire fois les patchs qui ont trs bien marchs. Aprs ma rechute, j'ai de nouveau fait des tentatives aux patchs, mais sans succs. J'ai ensuite arrt au Zyban et ?a a trs bien march aussi.    Ce que je tire comme conclusion, c'est que peu importe la mthode, il ne faut pas hsiter  se faire aider. Certains disent "Si t'es vraiment motiv tu n'as besoin de rien". Soit, ils ont peut-tre raison, mais il y a assez d'emb?ches sur le chemin pour ne pas s'en rajouter soi-mme. Deuxime conclusion : peu importe la mthode, si tu as vraiment pris ta dcision en ton for intrieur, tu y arriveras ! Lors de mes tentatives rates, je sais que je n'avais pas l'assurance des deux russites.    Ce qui a permis de me motiver : D'abord l'argent : qui peut aujourd'hui se permettre de passer 150 euros par mois en fume ? Ensuite, je ressentais une lassitude  me sentir si dpendante, les heures de manques avec les mains moites et le coeur qui bat, je haissais cette faiblesse.     Comment j'ai russi : une fois que j'ai pris ma dcision, je me suis laisse environ deux mois pour m?rir cette rvolution dans ma vie. Je fumais en me disant que bient?t ?a serait fini pour toujours. J'ai dcid d'une date prcise : aprs une soire d'anniversaire, o je savais bien que j'aurais envie de fumer. Le temps qu'arrive la date fatidique, je faisais mon deuil. Seuls les vrais fumeurs savent ce que renoncer  la cigarette peut tre comme vnement dans une vie. A la pharmacie, quand j'ai achet mes patchs j'ai pleur, d'angoisse, de tristesse... J'en ai beaucoup parl autour de moi, en me disant que les fois o l'envie de craquer serait forte, je me raccrocherai  la dception de mon entourage.    Le matin du jour prvu, j'ai mis mon patch, je me suis mise devant le lever de soleil, et j'ai fum ma dernire cigarette (enfin celle que je pensais tre la dernire) en en go?tant chaque bouffe. Puis j'ai attendu. Les minutes, puis les heures, puis les jours. J'attendais le manque, le vrai. Pas l'envie, le manque de nicotine. Mais il n'arrivait pas. Aors jour aprs jour je tenais. L'envie, je l'avais souvent, tellement que j'en ai souvent pleur. Mais le manque non. Alors je tenais bon.    Ensuite, tu ressens les bnfices, le go?t qui revient, le souffle. Tu te rends comptes que tes copains fumeurs puent vraiment. Tu es fier. Tu es libre. La premire anne je rvais presque toutes les nuits que je fumais, mais plus maintenant. Le manque est toujours prsent. C'est un creux qui parait-il ne passe jamais vraiment, mais c'est comme une cicatrice avec laquelle on apprend  vivre. Mais quel sentiment de libert !     Il faut le faire ! Il faut se jeter  l'eau ! Tu peux russir, c'est certain. Alors je te donne tout mon soutien.|`|8b16dc77e05356ec8d592b54837d0c67aa	"S'arrter de fumer, c'est trs facile; je l'ai fait plusieurs fois"  Le dclic qui m'a permis d' arrter pour de bon c'est une alerte: qu'on appelle l'A.I.T:accident (vasculaire crbral) ischmique transitoire.

C'tait le lendemain d'un mariage durant lequel j'avais beaucoup fum et comme  chaque fois le lendemain j'en ete coeur. donc je n'ai pas fum du tout le dimanche et bizarrement l'envie aprs ne m'est pas revenu.  Au bout d'une semaine je me suis demand jusqu'ou je pourrai aller et ca feras deux ans le 15 a?ut.  Je ne dis pas que je suis totalement gurie car j'ai toujours l'envie de fumer aprs un bon repas ou dans une soire avec un bon verre. Mais mainteant je fais du sport et?a m'aide bien et quand je suis  deux doigts d'en reprendre une je me dis que je n'ai pas fait tout ?a pour rien....Bon courage et choisis bien ton moment!|`|NYsbv2uuaa	pas de secret y a que la volont pour arreter de fumer... 15 jours de gallre... et le plus dure et fait.  trouver une motivation y en a des centaines... et puis quel fiert de dire : moi je ne fume plus et en plus avec les sous du tabac je me suis payer ?a !!! et les jaloux qui vous disent oh ?a va pas durer et c'est l que la fiert entre en jeux et  nous  dit tu va voir si ?a va pas durer je vais pas te donner raison!!!!   bon courrage et srieux qu'est ce qu'on se sent mieux et puis franchement c'est dguelasse et en plus ?a pu......je fumais un paquet par jour|`|916SMxgRaa	moi j ai pens a mes enfants un matin  :  je me suis dit si j avais le cancer de la gorge qui allait s en occuper et cela m a coup toutes envie de fumer encore sinon j ai essay patches   mais rien ny fait.

f05ed37f353b2786caf3c56ca025703caa	Der Blinddarm ist ein berbleibsel der Entwicklung. Bei uns Menschen hat er seine Aufgaben als funktioneller Darmabschnitt verloren. Sein Wurmfortsatz (den du wahrscheinlich meinst ) hat sich zu lymphatischem Gewebe weiterentwickelt, dient also der Krankheitsabwehr.  Da er aber nur einen minimalen Effekt hat, ist es bei einer Entzndung das Sinnvollste ihn rauszunehmen. Allerdings sollte man das auch nicht prophylaktisch tun, denn wie jede Operation ist auch diese mit einem Risiko verbunden.    Kleine Anmerkung: der Blindarm ist entgegen der vorherrschenden Meinung nicht unbedingt fest verwachsen. Man nennt ihn dann Caecum mobile. Das und die Tatsache, dass der Wurmfortsatz sehr unterschiedlich gro? ausgebildet sein kann, fhrt dazu, dass er sich fast berall im Bauchraum befinden kann (zum Leidwesen des Untersuchenden).|`|b1fd4f813979f2f418f9acc06e2cd285aa	wohin reist denn dein blinddarm?  hat er ein visum oder reicht der pass?|`|e964d0f0f1c8c65da3bfedf72b2eb230aa	Was ist die Frage?  Ich nehme an Du meinst nicht "reist", sondern "reisst".  Wenn Dein Kopf oder Dein Bein abreisst stirbst Du auch.  Du kommst doch auch nicht auf die Idee zu fragen, wozu man einen Kopf oder ein Bein braucht.    Was also willst Du genau wissen?|`|2849cafbe48773ef05a2867561a314f3aa	dein blinddarm reist? oh mann, das ist ja toll *lol* meiner sitzt fest im unterbauch, der war noch nie irgendwo.|`|663d85065822e0305e53e040d95e7983aa	Du meinst wenn er 'reisst'    Wenn ein Blinddarm reisst oder platzt hei?t das, das er vorher lange entzndet gewesen sein muss. Er  ist dann mit Eiter gefllt und dieser verteilt sich im Bauchraum, sodass sofort eine Blutvergiftung eintritt, die nicht mehr zu stoppen ist.    Der Blinddarm hat wohl heute keine Funktion mehr im menschlichen K?rper - zumindest kann man ihm keine zuordnen.   Wahrscheinlich ein Relikt aus alter Zeit, das sich berholt hat.|`|fb25a7b5abf85aa4ae893756aed04680aa	Unter einer Appendizitis versteht man die bakterielle Entzndung des Wurmfortsatzes des Blinddarms (Appendix vermiformis). Die volkstmliche Bezeichnung Blinddarmentzndung ist daher nicht korrekt, hat sich aber eingebrgert.     Der Blinddarm ist der blind endende, sackartige, etwa daumenlange Anfangsteil des aufsteigenden Dickdarms, der unterhalb der Einmndung des Dnndarms liegt. Am unteren Ende des Blinddarms befindet sich ein wurmartiger, zwischen zwei und 20 Zentimeter langer Anhang, der Wurmfortsatz (Appendix vermiformis). Die Lage des Wurmfortsatzes ist sehr variabel. Er kann mit dem Blinddarm verlagert sein, wie etwa bei Schwangeren nach oben, vor oder hinter dem Blinddarm oder sogar am Dnndarm fixiert.    Der Wurmfortsatz enth?lt sehr viele Lymphkn?tchen und wird deshalb h?ufig als Darmmandel bezeichnet, in Anlehnung an die Rachenmandel. ?hnlich wie das lymphatische Gewebe der Rachenmandeln bei Erk?ltungskrankheiten anschwillt, kann auch der Wurmfortsatz bei entzndlichen Darmerkrankungen vergr??ert sein.    H?ufigkeit  Die Blinddarmentzndung ist die h?ufigste Erkrankung im Bauchraum. Sie tritt bei etwa sieben Prozent der Bev?lkerung auf, bevorzugt zwischen dem 10. und 30. Lebensjahr. Man findet eine besondere H?ufung im Kinds- und Jugendalter sowie bei Schwangeren. Kleinkinder und alte Menschen hingegen erkranken selten. Die Blinddarmentzndung ist mit ca. 50 Prozent die h?ufigste Ursache des akuten Abdomens. Als akutes Abdomen bezeichnet man eine pl?tzlich auftretende, ernste Erkrankung in der Bauchh?hle, die in der Regel eine Operation oder zumindest die Beobachtung auf einer chirurgischen Station erfordert.|`|6bc3ecca9ed8606a2e7fc9aaa775afe0aa	Das h?ngt vom Land ab. Wenn dein Blinddarm reist, dann bist Du ja logischer weise mit auf Reisen, denn der Blinddarm ist ja in der Regel fest mit Dir verbunden.  Wenn also Dein Blinddarm mit Dir in ein Krisengebiet reist (z.B. in den Irak oder sonstwohin, wo Krieg ist), dann kann es natrlich sein, dass Du Dir eine Kugel oder eine Mine einf?ngst und tot bist.  Mein Blinddarm reist mit mir immer in die Sonne, wo es uns beiden dann richtig gut geht.  Und brigens: Egal ob der Blinddarm sinnvoll ist oder nicht, er ist trotzdem da und l?sst sich nicht durch irgendwelche Sinnfragen aus dem Bauch raus diskutieren.|`|vyT7t0Gnaa	Viele Mediziner vertreten die These, das der Blinddarm eine Funktion in der Immunabwehr spielt, das hei?t, ein nicht entzndeter Blinddarm hilft deinem K?rper erfolgreicher Keime, Viren und Bakterien abzuwehren.   Ob das bewiesen wurde wei? ich allerdings nicht!|`|e6aae78b9a2c8499697edbb0a2d0e477aa	Blindd?rme gehen nicht auf Reisen!  ;-)

f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	I feel your pain when it comes to overeating. I love food! Here are some tricks I've tried that actually work for me:  1- Whenever you eat, use a saucer. Don't put food on a regular dinner plate. Use a smaller plate (like one that's 6" in diameter). It will look like you're eating a HUGE amount and your brain will help turn off your appetite faster.  2- Load up on good food. If you like to eat a lot, use it to your advantage and eat food that is good for you like baby carrots, grapes, cucumbers, apples, etc. Unless you're a diabetic, there really is no such thing as a fresh fruit or vegetable "overload". I totally pig out on that stuff b/c I know it's good for me.  3- Exercise before your biggest meal. I go to the gym in the evenings (before dinner) and when I get home, I'm not really hungry. Exercise is a great appetite suppressant. When I do finally get hungry, all I want to eat is a small amount of something healthy. :-)    For motivation and exercise, here are a few things that worked for me:  1- Get a gym membership. I know you have an elliptical at home, but you're not using it. I have tons of exercise gadgets at home that are collecting dust. The minute I joined the gym, I was full steam ahead with exercising. I don't want my money to go to waste, so I use the gym 5 days a week!  2- Get a visual aid. Find a picture of yourself when you were skinny or you fit into a certain outfit that you can no longer wear. Tape that pic to your bathroom mirror or refrigerator so you see it constantly. That motivated me to get busy with the exercise.  3 - Get a pal. I've read many a fitness magazine that pointed out that studies show that a partner is one of the easiest ways to stick to a routine. If you can meet up with a friend to walk or jog - or even alternate "hosting" to do an exercise video at home, it can make a world of difference.    I hope that helps! I think everyone goes through this. Don't get discouraged. Take it one day at a time!!|`|3cd420b0476afc61e8fafcdfabd58625aa	I know what you mean about exersing....My husband and I have more rooms than we need in our home so one of the rooms we made into a workout room with all exercise equipment....lol it turns out, even though we have it we rarely use it (fyi, he's used it more than I have in the two years we've lived here, I could count the fingers on one hand to show how many times I've used it) when we had to go out to a gym and lived in a apt we actually went and worked out more.    I've had two kids (3yr old and 1yr old and now you can see why I don't workout..I'm too tired from the workout that they give me daily..lol) luckily after each pregnancy all the extra pounds just dropped off, literally, after delivering each baby. But I've nursed them both...so I've had to eat more than I'd usually eat to make milk for them and then my problem starts after I'm finished nursing them for good.  At that point in time I'm so use to eating so much, but now all those calories aren't being burned away because I'm not nursing and thus I gain weight!!!!  I've just finished nursing the 1yr old cause she turned 1 last November so until about 3wks ago I've been having a hard time with eating so much.  I had been so use to just eating when ever I see food even if I wasn't hungry(you know because of the whole nursing issue ).  So since I stopped nursing but was still eating like I was nursing I'd gained 30lbs since November!!!! So I've been drinking lots of water so that I feel full and when I see food I'm just so full I can't stand to put it in my mouth...but I still eat.  I don't have a set schedule like breakfast, lunch and dinner because I'm so busy taking care of my little ones but I eat as soon as I can during each day (mostly when they fall asleep for naps or when they finally fall asleep at night)  When I do eat though I eat either small portions (my husband loves to cook so we always have loads of cooked food which really makes eating everything in sight hard to resist!!!) for example: if there is lots of chicken, lasagna, and mashed potatoes, I will just take a small portion of each one or most of the time a medium size of just one and eat all of that.    Or another thing I do is I snack throughout the day...because I'm so busy taking care of my girls and might not get a good meal until they take a nap I snack (usually small snacking is best as to avoid over eating, of course) But if I'm snacking, I don't eat a meal...mainly because the snacks are usually unhealthy fatty stuff like Chips or Cake and so on, but if they were healthy snacks like apples and oranges and so on then I would still go ahead and  eat small meals.    Remember though...drink lots of fluids too!!! In a 24 hr day each day I drink 4-6 Liters of water (I know this cause I use a 2Liter Water Jug that I keep with me throughtout the day to make sure I'm drinking alot)  So far it's working great...I just weighed myself yesterday morning and I've lost 10lbs!!!!!!!|`|AA12081817	I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.    It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.      Also start counting your calories.  Write them down.  You would be amazed as to how much more aware you are of your caloric intake, if you actually write it down.  We recently discovered a site that offers a great program that counts calories, as well as keeps track of everything.  It allows multiple users, so everyone in the family can keep track.  They offer a free 7 day trial, and so far I am very impressed with the product.  Try the 7 days and see.  It allows you to add the exercise that you do during the day, which increases the amount of calories you can take in.  Very Cool!!  http://www.calorieking.com    A sight with some really cool diet calculators and interesting calorie counting calculators is here.  Check it out.  http://www.caloriesperhour.com/        Check out my before and after pic at my yahoo 360 page  http://profiles.yahoo.com/gorillamyke    Stay motivated, and get up and walk every day.  I seriously lost all my weight starting off my day on my walk.     Good LUCK!|`|rHwiaUOvaa	you just got to eat regularly. start by walking 2km per day. do this for a week . then increase this to 3 to 5km for the next week. after the end of the month, start jogging, then run with slow pace, increase running..    start swimming. join people who run everyday , this will create a routine. stick to it. you will do it. everything will be difficult for a day. do it for a week , you will achieve what you want to achieve.  remember nothing happens in a day.    "For anything worth having one must pay the price; and the price is always work,  patience, love, self-sacrifice.

ALL THE BEST.|`|7vvZXBNUaa	I feel your pain.  I am currently trying to lose weight as well and have been pretty successful thus far (50lbs in 4 months).  While it is not the healthiest weight loss plan, I cut back my carbs to no more than 20 a day.  It has really curbed my appetite and the extremely limited food choices (some green leafies, meat, eggs and cheese) have significantly reduced my caloric intake.  I tried fiber tablets in the past and they didn't help at all.    I normally hate to workout, but I've discovered that if I workout while watching TV, it goes much faster.  Try placing your eliptical in front of your television.  Then only watch TV if you are on the eliptical.  This has really worked for me.  I have gone from exercising 0x a week to about 5x a week.|`|b7dc2f6f160af3d21e44169f36d81e7faa	Fats are nothing more than stored acid. By taking alkaline food, you prevent the intake of acid to create more fats.    Besides doing exercise, you must eat only alkaline food.    Read the book "pH miracle for weight loss". See photos of people losing weight at ease. If you want to loose weight super fast, there is an alkaline liquid diet. According the book, people are loosing 10 pounds or more within the first 8 days. Go to the website below to see which food (and even fruits) that are acidic.|`|AA10149515	Do other fun activities like hiking, kayaking, dance classes, yoga. Those all burn calories.

But most people are never aware of it like you! I have the same problem too ;) But I am walking out of it and receiving abundance into my life...    Mostly, people fear success and happiness because they have poor self esteem and feel a very strong sense of guilt and feel that they are not good enough to deserve success..    A few ways to find out what is the root of this is to ask yourself some good questions.    - Is there something, someone whom you are very angry at?  - Are you also angry at your parents? Why?  - Do you blame yourself for being angry at them?  - Do you want to become unsuccessful because you want to get back at them?  - Do you want to be RIGHT or do you want to be happy?  - IF you want to be happy, will you CHOOSE to let go of all these and CHOOSE to COMMIT to your own happiness?    But these questions are just a start for you to be self aware. To furthur heal this issue so that you can accept and receive success and happiness into your life. I would suggest that you attend this course that I attended called Psychology of vision.    If you are interested to find out more, please email me at verityy@yahoo.com|`|gWM02MuNaa	Maybe you are afraid of losing something great either the girl or the job. There are lots of people that feel this way. Just know that you deserve to be happy and that's life when things don't work out as planned. Try to enjoy it while you have it. Some people never get to be happy in life. Why not give it a shot. It won't kill you...Good luck to you!|`|a66ac756591305771b8a6252268ca340aa	Same here -  I take everything down with me when it looks like I might be getting close to contentment, and then I spend all my time regretting what I've done. Good luck, you need to know that you deserve to be happy, and then you'll stop sabotaging yourself.

3iu8gdGdaa	Hola!!  La celulitis produce hoyos en la piel por la acumulacin de agua, grasa y toxinas, mientras que la flacidez deja la piel blanda porque se pierde tono muscular. Ambas se producen por desequilibrios hormonales, dietas ricas en grasas y falta de ejercicio. ?Elimnalas!    PIERNAS: Para tener unas piernas fuertes, musculosas y sin celulitis, lo mejor es el ejercicio; as que, camina media hora al da y las fortalecers. Evita ponerte pantalones ajustados y, si tienes estras, no adelgaces bruscamente, o te saldrn ms. Aplica un anticelultico a diario y, una vez a la semana, esta mascarilla: Mezcla hidratante con dos cucharadas de sal marina y frtate las piernas durante cinco minutos. Aclara con agua y jabn.    Ejercicio ideal: Footing, tenis, esqu acutico y aerobic. En casa, tmbate con las piernas en alto, dobla las rodillas y vuelve a la posicin inicial. Repite 25 veces.    Encuanto a la alimentacin debe ser equilibrada; toma abundantes alimentos frescos y ricos en fibras, bebe al menos 2 litros de agua al da, prescinde del caf y el alcohol.|`|7abb0855bccfa3d942c74d0b0a5386f6aa	solo lser|`|8bf87b93c67c81848b264865e183f965aa	Con ejercicios, caminar y bicicleta, y eliminar los carbohidratos de las comidas.|`|d5d6e87fb49d8321167944c6a8237d02aa	Con una buena crema anticelultica...dicen ser muy efectivas...creo que es la nivea good bye!una cosa as se llaman,la pasan mucho en la tv.

Prefiera prendas amplias y de tejidos naturales que dejen a la piel transpirar. Tampoco, se debe cruzar, al estar sentada, las piernas, ya que todo ello dificulta la circulacin adecuada de la sangre lo que propicia la aparicin de celulitis en las reas de la cadera y los muslos  .     - Cuidar la alimentacin.  El aporte energtico (calrico) no debe ser superior al que necesitas.  Por lo tanto, debes tomar en cuenta lo siguiente:    o Reducir las grasas saturadas al mnimo (evitar mantequilla, embutidos, etc.) y preferir carnes blancas (pollo sin piel o pescado) asados o a la plancha.      o Preparar comidas bajas de sal (preferiblemente excluirla por completo) para evitar la retencin de lquidos y, en su lugar, se debe condimentar con ajo, cebollas, perejil, jugo de limn y otras hierbas aromticas.  Igualmente, debes comer bananas y pltanos para obtener potasio.    o Comer verduras, las hortalizas y alimentos ricos en hierro (lentejas, berro, etc), ya que la falta de ste favorece la aparicin de celulitis y dificulta mucho ms su eliminacin.    o Comer productos integrales (arroz, pasta,  cereales) que absorben y eliminan toxinas.    o Evitar consumir dulces  simples, de absorcin rpida (pasteles, chocolate, galletas, miel, etc.).los cuales deben ser sustituidos por limones, pi?as, fresas, pomelo o naranjas (no ms de dos piezas de frutas al da). Todas estas frutas tienen pocas caloras y excelentes propiedades diurticas lo cual es ideal no slo para combatir la piel de naranja sino tambin hasta el estre?imiento     o  La leche debe ser tomada con moderacin, ya que contiene azcares de absorcin rpida. Se aconseja tomar lcteos en forma desnatada o descremados para asegurar el aporte de calcio.      - Beber diariamente libro y medio de agua.  No tomar sodas o bebida similares.      - En cuanto a los ejercicios, es aconsejable caminar, montar en bicicleta,o hacer footing, por lo menos, 30 minutos diarios y bajar y subir las escaleras siempre que sea posible en lugar de usar los elevadores. No olvide que bailar es, tambin, un buen ejercicio. Si su trabajo le obliga a permanecer mucho tiempo sentado o de pie, procure contrarrestar su efectos caminando alrededor de su puesto cada 60 minutos y girando, de forma circulatoria, sus tobillos    - Adems, es recomendable adquirir una crema de algas marinas o reafirmante y masajear, con ella, en forma circular las zonas afectadas.

54843cb2f875ae217aa1efe71939bdabaa	Tambm chamado de vaginite ou vulvovaginite. S?o as altera??es caracterizadas por um fluxo vaginal anormal, geralmente com volume aumentado, podendo ter ou n?o cheiro desagradvel, irrita??o, coceira ou ardncia na vagina ou na vulva e vontade de urinar freqentemente.  um dos problemas ginecolgicos mais comuns e uma das causas mais freqentes de consulta ao ginecologista.       Como se desenvolve?     normal haver descarga vaginal durante os anos reprodutivos. Ela  proveniente da secre??o das glandulas cervicais e das glandulas de Bartholin, da descama??o das clulas vaginais e das bactrias presentes na flora vaginal. Nesta fase, a vagina normalmente  resistente s infec??es, pois seu epitlio  muito resistente e o seu meio  muito cido, inibindo o crescimento excessivo dos patgenos. O muco cervical e o fluxo menstrual s?o alcalinos, assim como a excita??o, a rela??o sexual e o stress, o que causa um aumento do pH vaginal, podendo predispor  vaginite. Na infancia s?o comuns as vulvovaginites inespecficas causadas por uma higiene inadequada e pela maneira incorreta de realizar a higiene aps evacuar. Aps a menopausa, h decrscimo na produ??o de estrgenos, ocorrendo uma modifica??o no epitlio vaginal, que novamente se torna suscetvel s agress?es externas. Alguns produtos qumicos encontrados em sab?es, sabonetes, absorventes e substancias perfumadas podem causar irrita??o e desconforto importante.            ALTERA??ES DA FLORA MICROBIANA:        CANDIDASE VAGINAL      Tambm conhecida como monilase vaginal. A candida  um fungo geralmente presente no trato gastro-intestinal e regi?o perianal. Ele cresce bem no meio cido da vagina, podendo coloniz-la. O controle do seu crescimento depende da presen?a de outros micro-organismos na flora vaginal normal. Muitas vezes ele aparece quando ocorre um desequilbrio entre os integrantes da flora vaginal normal. A resistncia do organismo cai pelo uso de antibiticos de amplo espectro, gravidez, diabetes, infec??es, doen?as que causam deficincia imunolgica como AIDS, ingest?o excessiva de carboidratos ou o uso de alguns medicamentos como anticoncepcionais orais e corticides.    A candidase n?o  considerada uma doen?a sexualmente transmissvel (DST), entretanto o parceiro sexual pode apresentar sintomas como coceira ou irrita??o no pnis. Os sintomas mais freqentes nas mulheres s?o o corrimento espesso tipo nata de leite, geralmente acompanhado de coceira e irrita??o intensa da vagina e vulva e podem piorar na poca da menstrua??o e com a rela??o sexual.    O exame clnico e a realiza??o de exame direto da secre??o vaginal em solu??o salina ou usando hidrxido de potssio a 10% evidencia a presen?a do fungo.    O tratamento inclui o uso de antifngicos em vulos ou cremes vaginais ou por via oral.

After that you're left with OTC stuff like salicylic acid preperations. as far as getting rid of scars, not much you can do other than skin grafting $$$. good luck

PtRKFnpNaa	Minha linda, parabns por voce ser uma pessoa exclarecida e atualizada, alm de realmente ser centrada e encarar a sua primeira rela??o com consciencia e amor.  Quanto a vacina contra o HPV, ela pode ser aplicada em pessoas ativas sexualmente e tambm nas que nunca tiveram relac??es sexuais (virgens).  A indica??o  que ela seja tomada a partir dos 14 anos.  Eu tenho duas filhas, uma ainda virgem e outra j ativa sexualmente. Todas as duas foram vacinadas preventivamente, e n?o houve nenhuma intercorrencia ou rea??o organica aps serem vacinadas.  Quanto a eficcia da vacina, eu n?o tenho dvidas porque se n?o houvesse eficcia ela n?o passaria nos testes de pesquisas do FDA dos EEUU, e todos sabemos que eles s?o bastante rigorosas e cautelosos nesse sentido, n?o liberariam a vacina se n?o houvesse dados combobatrios da eficcia. A vacina  aplicada em tres doses de dois em dois meses, e n?o tive nenhuma orient??o, a respeito do impedimento de ter rela??es sexuais durante a aplica??o das tres doses.  Quero s acrescentar que a vacina n?o tem eficcia para as pessoas que s?o portadoras do  HPV ou que j tiveram e se curaram, mas a cura  em termos, porque a pessoa que foi portadora do HPV, precisa ter o cuidado de no mnimo duas vezes por ano, fazer o exame histopatolgico como preventivo do cancer do colo do tero.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Usa camisinha apenas.|`|3pS63W3laa	A indica??o da vacina contra o HPV  justamente para pessoas como voc: que ainda n?o iniciaram sua vida sexual e assim n?o tiveram contato com o vrus. Ela n?o  arriscada: vc n?o ter HPV depois de faz-la. Se sua mdica n?o  a favor da vacina converse com outro ginecologista: hoje em dia, para as pessoas que tm condi??es financeiras de adquiri-la, ela certamente est indicada.
bP960sWXaa	Overall I would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the Crest Whitestrips, some more than others. Our office uses Crest Supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more ($60.00 vs $30.00). You can purchase the drugstore version, but do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup (tartar or plaque) will impede their ability to work. Also, don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on (same reason). The strips are probably your best low price alternative, much less than in office whitening or custom trays (about $500.00). I am also hearing happy reviews with the Aquafresh whitening trays, unlike the strips they don't have the tendency to slip or move). All of the methods (strips, trays, custom trays, in office whitening) have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive, but will not harm the enamel. You might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke. Most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective. Whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life, as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again.     Good luck!    JAMRDH - a dental hygienist|`|Mf9rDPVWaa	Well if you are going for a cheaper method, i would recommend using crest white strips. They are very effective and are fairly cheap. I think now they have ones that work in half the time. You just have to put up with the 1/2 hour once or twice a day with the strips in your mouth. For more money you can see your dentist about bleaching trays for a at home solution or you can have them do it at the office. If money is no option, you can have them do the zoom/chairside method which is the quickest.|`|wkBARVAnaa	You should visit dentist and let her whiten your teeth thru BLEACH!|`|hIUxfRrwaa	Polar day and Polar night. My mum uses it and the next day its like someone off a toothpaste add! Its amazing. They take an impression of your mouth and give you retainer like things and u fill them with the bleach stuff (about $30 lasts a long time) and leave them in over night. But the impressions are about 400. VERYY well worth it though, besides, you only get that done once. I honestly reccomend it! They also have a website so google them. Goodluck
AA11286142	Many people forget to clean this area mainly because it does not play a big part in our life. You have your feet for walking, arms for moving things, eyes for seeing, ears for hearing etc... but your belly button is just a nonexistent cut umbillical cord. Due to our societies procrastination and always being in a hurry there's just no more time to care about your belly button. I, on the other hand, wash my belly button because it still is skin and skin has sebum (oil) secreting glands and the skin sheds. It should be washed to prevent build up and so it won't smell (ew)  Keep clean =]|`|Mf9rDPVWaa	Well I clean my belly button all the time. What people really neglect to clean in their ears. And not the inside where the Q-Tip per-say is supposed to go but all along the ridges of your ears.

Les?es nessa rea podem levar a dores de cabe?a, dor no rosto, deslocamento na mandbula e incapacidade de abrir e fechar a boca. Existe tratamento cirrgico e n?o-cirrgico para essas condi??es.    Desordens na JTM (junta temporomandibular) s?o uma famlia de problemas relacionados com a complexa junta da mandbula. Se voc tem tido sintomas como dor ou um som de clique, voc ficar feliz de saber que esses problemas s?o mais facilmente diagnosticados e tratados do que no passado. Esses sintomas ocorrem quando as juntas da mandbula e os msculos da mastiga??o n?o trabalham juntos corretamente. JTM significa Junta Temporomandibular, que  o nome de cada junta (direita e esquerda) que conecta seu maxilar ao cranio. Como alguns tipos de problemas da JTM podem levar a condi??es mais srias, detec??o precoce e tratamento s?o importantes. Nenhum tratamento consegue resolver completamente desordens da JTM e o tratamento leva tempo para ser efetivo.    Problemas com sua mandbula?    Desordens na JTM ocorrem por diversas raz?es. Voc pode apertar ou prender seus dentes, contraindo seus msculos e estressando sua JTM. Voc pode ter danificado sua junta mandibular por causa de les?es ou doen?as. Les?es e artrite podem danificar diretamente a junta ou esticar ou romper os ligamentos dos msculos. Como resultado, o disco, o qual  feito de cartilagem e funciona como amortecimento da junta pode sair de posi??o. Qualquer que seja a causa, os resultados podem incluir uma mordida desalinhada, dor, cliques ou rangido quando voc abre sua boca ou dificuldade para abrir amplamente a boca.

Quanto mais vezes voc respondeu sim,  mais provvel que voc tenha problemas na JTM. Entender os problemas na JTM tambm ir ajud-lo a compreender como elas s?o tratadas.    Tratamento    H vrias op??es de tratamento que pode utilizar para melhorar a harmonia o funcionamento de sua mandbula. Uma vez que uma avalia??o confirme o diagnstico de desordem JTM, ns iremos determinar o correto curso de tratamento.  importante notar que o tratamento sempre funciona melhor com uma abordagem conjunta de cuidados pessoais junto com cuidados profissionais.    As metas iniciais s?o aliviar os espasmos musculares e a dor nas juntas. Isso  geralmente conseguido com um analgsico, antiinflamatrio ou relaxante muscular. Esterides podem ser injetados nas juntas para reduzir a dor e a inflama??o. Cuidados pessoais geralmente s?o efetivos e incluem:    1. Descansar a mandbula  2. Manter seus dentes separados quando voc n?o est engolindo ou mastigando  3. Comer comidas moles  4. Aplicar gelo ou calor  5. Exercitar sua mandbula  6. Praticar boa postura.    Tcnicas de controle de estresse, tais como biofeedback ou terapia fsica tambm podem ser recomendadas, assim como o uso de um dispositivo composto de plstico claro conhecido como splint. Um splint, ou protetor-noturno se encaixa nos seus dentes superiores e inferiores e ajuda a mant-los separados, relaxando, dessa forma, os msculos e reduzindo a dor. H diferentes tipos de dispositivos usados para diferentes fins. Um protetor-noturno ajuda a parar o aperto e a tritura??o dos dentes e reduz a tens?o muscular  noite e ajuda a proteger a superfcie das juntas. Um dispositivo-de-posicionamento-anterior move seu maxilar para frente, aliviando a press?o me partes da mesma e ajudando no posicionamento do disco. Ele pode ter que ser usado 24 horas por dia para ajudar na cura da mandbula. Um estabilizador orttico  usado 24 horas/dia ou  noite, para colocar a mandbula na posi??o correta. Esses dispositivos tambm ajudam a prevenir o desgaste dos dentes.    E sobre a corre??o de mordida ou cirurgia?    Caso seu problema na JTM  causado por problemas no encaixe de seus dentes, voc pode necessitar de um tratamento como ajuste de mordida (balanceamento), aparelhos ortod?nticos com ou sem reconstru??o da mandbula ou trabalho restaurativo nos dentes. Op??es cirrgicas tais como artroscopia e reestrutura??o de junta aberta s vezes s?o necessrias, mas reservadas a casos graves. O Dr. Silegy n?o considera a cirurgia JTM a menos o maxilar n?o consiga abrir, esteja deslocada e n?o reajustvel, apresente degenera??o grave ou o paciente tenha passado, sem sucesso, por tratamentos com aparelhos.

AA10301974	I think I came in early morning one day and left late evening the next day.     There isn't much to remember. They give you some medication then an hour later you will be in the surgery room staring at the blank color they have over your head, and probably sleeping. It is possible you might stay awake during the surgery, but if you do you won't remember much when the medication wears off.    It is a bit painful, after all they just carved a pocket under your skin and set a heavy object there. The pain goes away entirely within a couple weeks, and the discomfort within a few months, perhaps no more than a couple weeks after the pain is gone.      Take things easy until you are allowed to use that side of your body normally.

kxyR9e57aa	Hypoglycemia means low blood sugar, usually below 65 mg/dl.  Hyperglycemia means high blood sugar, and that is somewhat relative.  Fasting hyperglycemia means a blood sugar of 100 mg/dl or more.  Diabetes is a disease characterized by either inadequate production of insulin (Type I) or resistance to insulin (Type II) diabetes.  In diabetes there is a tendency toward high blood sugars because the sugar cannot get into the cells in the normal manner, and it is inside the cells where the sugar is used as a source of energy.  There is much more to diabetes than that, and is it not simply a disease in which the ability to use sugar is affected.|`|zuOPSr5Eaa	it all has to do with glucose level, which is the main energy source for your body.  hypo- means lower than normal  hyper- means higher  and diabetes is a disease with the major symptom being hyperglycemia due to defective regulation of glucose levels.   you need to find out of it was "hyper" or "hypo" there is a big difference in how to manage them...|`|Knz8iJSWaa	hypoglycemia is low blood sugar  hyperglycemia is high blood sugar  people who suffer from hypo or hyper glycemia are said to be diabetic|`|AA12207897	Hypoglycemia is low blood sugar. Your body produces too much insulin. This can sometimes be a precursor to diabetes.    Hyperglycemia is high blood sugar. Your body doesn't produce enough insulin.    Diabetes incorporates both hypo- and hyperglycemia. The pancreas is shutting down. It produces little or no insulin on its own.|`|gyTcpbpiaa	Hypoglycemic, is low blood  sugar, Hyperglycemic is elevated blood sugar.  DiabetesMellitus is the disease.  sugars could drop very low, or get very high.  Usually, oral insulin or insulin injections are needed to control the sugar levels. Close monitoring by your physician, along with calorie controlled diets, and exercise are 3 ways of keeping your diabetes in control.|`|QvDGQjO4aa	well I have juvenile diabetes myself, Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugers are low all the time and you need to keep candy, orange juice or gluca tabs around in case your sugar drops to low. Hyperglycemia which i have is when your sugar is HIGH all the time and need to be on different types of insulin and sliding scale to control your sugars. It is all a form of diabetes.Diabetes is when the pancreas makes to much or to little to no insulin to regulate the gluclose/sugars your body makes on a everday basis.|`|pr2bLCWTaa	Hypoglycemia is called low blood sugar, which means that you have low glucose or sugar in your body. At least you have tendency of having low blood sugar. Hyperglycemia is high blood sugar. They are related to diabetes
OI3bf4yjaa	There is not a single blood test that can detect cancer. There are some "markers" for which blood can be tested. One can have cancer even without elevated markers, and the markers can be elevated even in the absence of cancer. Therefore, those blood tests are usually used in conjunction with other tests to determine if cancer is present.|`|AA12066269	If they ran full blood panel there might have been a test for blood calcium, which may indicate a presence of cancer, or the return of a cancer you had previously.      Not all cancers are detected through blood tests.  Thyroid problems can also cause digestive problems, unexplained weight loss or gain, and problems regulating your body temperature.

ZkuYBUByaa	Ummm ewww!  If you exercise it is best that you shower right after.

I bet its pretty stank in your room.|`|dfyZf6cWaa	shower when u can do not wait cause the next day ehh it gets worse lol|`|8MTxFbctaa	I always shower right away; it makes my body feel better too.

j0HODafgaa	use a decent mouth wash , make sure your bristles on your toothbrush are not that hard .   Also when you brush you should only hold the brush with 2 fingers , which helps prevent you putting to  much pressure on your gums .         Also if you floss , cut it down a bit to once every few days .     If you follow my advice your gums will be back to normal in no time :)|`|2Eaga0ywaa	here are some nice ideas to treat sore gums:    Take a tablespoon of mustard oil and add a teaspoon of common salt to it. Wash your hands well. With the forefinger take a small amount of this mixture and massage the gums gently in upward, downward and circular strokes. Do this for 30 seconds and then gargle with warm water. Do this 2-3 times a day.     Take half a teaspoonful of omum. Grind it to a fine powder and add a few drops of mustard oil to it. Now use this to massage the gums. Gargle with warm water. Repeat at least twice a day.     Use a herbal tea made with henna leaves as a mouthwash.   The bark of acacia has astringent properties. Make a decoction, dilute and use it as a gargle thrice a day. It is very refreshing and leaves a sweet taste in the mouth.     Burn alum in a non-stick pan. Powder the burnt mass. Use a pinch of this as a tooth powder for gum massage. Gargle with plain water. Do this once or twice a day. It reduces spongy gums and heals toothache. Alum is an astringent.     Take a teaspoon of castor oil. Add a large pinch of powdered camphor to it. Mix and gently massage the gum with it. Rinse mouth with warm water.     To prepare a soothing mouthwash for sore gums, boil 10-15 fresh eucalyptus leaves in a litre of water. Simmer for five minutes, then switch off heat. Cover and keep aside. Strain and add 2-3 drops of clove oil. If you do not have clove oil, add the powder of 6-7 finely ground cloves and bring the mixture to the boil again. Filter, cool and use as a mouthwash after every meal. This can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days.     Soft neem or acacia twigs should be used as tooth brushes. Chew on the twig till it softens and splits. This takes about five minutes. Then spit out the fragments and gargle. It is a disinfectant, and excellent for gum massage and mastication.

MPX0f5jzaa	I worked there for like two months in college and my God their cologne and perfume smells so bad I was coughing all the time.    Smells like cheap misguided capitalism to me!  All those shirtless bozos hanging out by the door deserve it!  LOL|`|eMAd3ZVQaa	its not that the malls don't care, its that the store is required to spray a whole lot. That is part of their marketing to attract consumers who walk by. They have to spray the articles of clothing on every table and in every closet...not one by one just like the table. Right now they are cutting back on it and are spraying the store once every hour opposed to once every 30 minutes. Its not the malls fault, but if you really want to take a stand towards it try contacting the company, although they probs. will ignore you, because the smell is apart of their whole image. I have been working there for almost two years and I admit it can get kind of heavy but like I said they are cutting back on it. I hope that this helped. I am pretty sure it is not that bad to the point where you cant breathe while walking in the mall, opposed to if you were standing in the store. this goes for abercrombie, Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, and Ruhel.

02O0SnUWaa	for you, the best bet is running.  for a diet, ok, always eat breakfast, it actully helps you loose weight!  eat a cup of fruit, oatmeal, or healthy cereals,  no huge breakfasts like a lot of people do, although breakfast should be the biggest meal, you don't need to eat an elephents portion.  since your in school, i would say for lunch, just be careful what you put in your body, i don't know if you eat caffitiera food, or if you pack a lunch, its healthier to pack because you know what your eating. no greasy foods like pizza, you just don't need that, but once in a while its ok. after school have a small snack to keep you from over eating at dinner, like some nuts and fruit or something.  for dinner, your meat portion should not be bigger then the size of your palm, it acctully should be much smaller.  eat a variady of things like instead of just a pork chop, have it with some veggies.  never eat after 7:30!  I heard aciu berry really works well, it is a pill, but its not bad, its suppose to just clear out all the bad junk in your body.  but i don't reccomend it unless this diet and exercise dosen't work.   the only reason im suggesting it, is because obesity is hereditary in my family, we have to actully clear out our systems with something or els it will stick for a long time.  but your might not be as bad. good luck! it might seem hard but trust me, if i can do it, you can do it!  by the way im 15 i started when I was 14.|`|iam79Xpzaa	walking a mile a day will help you in your endeavors
BWmSvTZ0aa	You don't have to tell her if you don't want to. Go to the store and pick up some pads or tampons. Everyone grows up someday, and the choice to tell is yours.|`|W057fV0Vaa	Tell her, Hei I am bleeding|`|m3YelGhlaa	just dont wear i tampon and when you are near her spread your legs and she will be like what the **** is that ****|`|uVTosLc9aa	What reason do you need to tell her? If you need her to buy you supplies, just walk up to her and say "grandma, I got my period, I need to get some tampons".  If you dont need her to buy you supplies and you have your own funds to get them yourself, dont even bother telling her.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	just pull her aside and say "grandma, i became a woman"|`|LElwnGbpaa	If you're really that uncomfortable about telling her I don't see the need too if you can buy your own razors and bra's then you can buy your own pads/tampons if you need help search it up online but if a problem comes up and you really need to tell her just do it I'm certain she will help because it happens to all girls!|`|KWl605JTaa	HEY GRANMA I NEED A TAMP  I JUST GOT A VIST FROM AUNT FLO|`|0A3eadfYaa	Just curious.  You seem to be doing fine by yourself, getting all the feminine products and all.  So why do you need to tell your grandma?  Sorry about your mom, by the way.|`|AA11562326	If you're not that close to your grandmother, and can do your own shopping, you could just get your own femminine supplies, and she would figure it out.    But I don't think it would be that awkward to tell her.  She's a woman.  This is a normal thing for girls, she would expect it.  You could just be matter of fact and mention that the next time she goes shopping, you could use some (napkins, liners, whatever its called - I'm a guy)|`|2PCksILraa	Just tell her, it happens to every girl, and she knew it would happen to you eventually.  It's not as if you're coming out of the closet on being gay or anything, don't worry about a thing. :)|`|otsuH97Jaa	if you need to tell her that you need money, i just ask my grandmother for money for "feminine supplies"|`|phCae73Kaa	just remember that she was your age once so just start out asking can we talk...  and let the conversation go from there.|`|QfkeanBQaa	im not close to my mom either...  well i just walk up to her and told her i needed to talk...  about "lady issue"  &nd my mom understood me.|`|QKnilCNDaa	you: gramma, mother nature gave me a gift a few days ago  gramma: u mean ur period?  you: yes  gramma: go get a tampon then    lol good luck :)|`|VMMq3C35aa	Though my mom didn't pass away before I got my first period, I can understand not having someone to talk to.  My mom's idea of a sex talk was "girls only have premarital sex if they have really, really low self-esteem.  If I find out you're sexual active, I'll put you in a convent."  Not to mention that to this day, she still can't say 'period' but refers to it as 'that special time of the month.'  Anyway, again, that's just to show I understand.    You could just tell your grandmother straight out.  She's a woman too so she'll understand.  You could tell her by asking her to get you some maxi pads or tampons.  She'll put two and two together.  Or, since you don't feel close to anyone in your family, do you feel close to the mother of any of your friends?  You went shopping for bras with them so maybe you can speak to your best friend's mother.  That's what I would do....and honestly, that's what I had to do.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Do you have any pads or tampons??? If not you need to tell her so she can get you some!!! Just say hey grandma I got my period and can you please take me to the store to get some pads or tampons?|`|pfm0wcEIaa	Tell her you need some pads... That's all you need to say.  What would be weird is if you DIDN'T get your period...    You might want to start doing a lot of reading since you don't really have a female mentor through all this.  When you start dating you might want to start seeing a counselor so at least you have a responsible adult to talk to.  You are going to feel very alone and confused otherwise.    I don't think it is very nice of your family to leave isolate you like that.  They should be offering you help.  But since they are not, it is better not to ask for it.  They will probably just make things even worse|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	hey, i got my period|`|gzaXHcweaa	Just show her your underwear, and be like, uh grandma, look... thats what I did and my mom wasnt too shocked|`|wgZVeLZPaa	Awww, just tell her. Why are you so afraid to grow up around her? Is she mean to you or something?  I'm sorry about your mom. But I think your grandmother would be OK with you telling her. You need stuff for it! :)  Good luck.

Some people that I know feel that it calms them down while others tell me it makes them paranoid.|`|tFcsLR7Maa	I think it can. if you're a person that has difficulties focusing on things after you smoke it can help u focus better.     If you're a person that DOESNT HAVE DIFFICULTIES FOCUSING and you smoke it might make you FOCUS TO MUCH.     It all depends on the person.|`|vdT9VkZoaa	it calmed me down.

bDhMvs9Uaa	take it before exercise and after     you can use it to assess if you are becoming fitter. Over the duration of your exercise program /sessions you will see a drop in your resting HR this means you are adapting to the exercise and becoming fitter.     And you can use the heart rate after exercise to monitor how well you can recover.However your body will adapt to the exercise after a  while so you will need to alter your workout (increase the amount of reps or duration) making it a little bit harder and then you can keep on improving your fitness    hope this kind of helps :)

Trust me, I can do 50-60 push ups and still don't gain any muscle mass.|`|wue7sDOBaa	ummm if thats the sum total of your workout you may need to do a bit more. im really not sure that will make too much of a difference. theres plenty of other exercises you can do. try to do at least 5 different exercises with at least 3 sets in each for a decent workout|`|tTWyJEATaa	take creatine and other mass tablets and it will go much faster.     and don't just do 15 keep going till u can't physically do any more|`|r0ajaxHVaa	As you get stronger, increase reps.
tPKGgYmuaa	Ok, let's think about this. You have a cast, which is little more than solidified gauze. You want to put the weight of your entire body - whatever that might be - on that rather than use a crutch or cane. If you love casts so much that you wish to wear it for a longer time than necessary, then by all means. But seriously, if you talk to any doctor, they will tell you not to that. Even though it's a simple closed fracture, it is still a break, and therefore open to complications if you don't let it heal. I know a cast/cane or crutch combo isn't stylish or convenient, but look at it this way: once the break heals the area will have a thicker calcification and in all likeliness never break in that (exact) area again.     Also, you mention that they make fiberglass casts but you didn't say that you have one on. If you don't, again, I recommend using a crutch. It'll be better for you in the long run.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Ask the dr  what he thinks, I am thinking NO you shouldnt.
aaegTEqNaa	the acai berry person sounds like spam. don't listen to them.    it's "whole grain" not "whole meal". And it is better than white, but focusing on carb foods to diet is not a good idea if you want to lose weight. carbs are sugar foods (glucose). that's why athletes eat pasta and carb rich foods the night before big games.     so the answer is, you will not lose weight. you will, however, not gain as much weight when eating whole grain over white carb foods|`|4CsGde1qaa	That is a lot of carb talk, but it doesn't matter how much carb you love as long as you exercise. Don't give up.
2VtkgzcIaa	It's called indigestion. Try taking some Tums or Pepto... If it still keeps happening you should talk to your doctor for a prescription.

5a2XVczMaa	I was exactly the same... and still am....lol  Memory games may help, but i found that remembering something 5 or 6 seconds go was ok. So the memory games didn't really make that much difference.    Im not a big fan of the whole herbal medicine thing but there's this herb called Ginkgo and it is used in tablets that help memory problems.  Check out your local chemist/drug store. it'll help with your bad memory. It did with me =]    If you don't already, carry a diary with you at school and write down everything as you go. Trying to remember to write something down later never worked for me... i always forgot too.  I remember (when i was at school) how frustrating it was, knowing that you had something soooo important that you had to remember, but you just cant get it out. And the frustrating part is that you know that it was extreeeeemly important. (like something to do with school work, or something that the teacher asked you to do for the next day).    If you find that it does start to get you into trouble at school (i remember one time, my teacher asked us to write a short paragraph about something. and that was all we had to do... I couldn't remember what we had to write about, so i got into big trouble the next day), Anyway, tell your teacher that you are having trouble with your memory and if he/she knows of any ways too help improve it. Tell them your realy concerned that it might affect your grades. Ehh it's just a suggestion.    Hope this helps.|`|TB5NAHwSaa	It could be because you don't believe it is good. If you believe things like I will forget this I just know it. Then you get what you wished for. So think good things about your memory and your life.|`|AIIXmk4kaa	if tou dont practice memorizing stuff......you wont get any better....so JUST PRACTICE!|`|949AJbB6aa	Because you are excited to say something and don't consider whether or not you have said it to these particular person. If it starts to bug you enough you will start to remember who you have told stuff too.|`|0b50usV0aa	You're just careless!just think before saying everything for just a minute,then you see that you're memory is as strong as others.  And be careful!maybe your friends annoy you!|`|m3ThrbDMaa	You might need to be checked for Diabetes...In certain cases, Diabetes can cause reduced functionality of the brain...|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	it could be stress from your so called friends. if it is there is a class you can go into to learn to do stuff and recall memory again and try it talk to yourparents about it.|`|mFYBg5BKaa	I think you should do memorization exercises. Remember the card matching game we played when we were kids? I used to play that game all the time... now I have a photographic memory. I see something and later on, I can think about it, see exactly what I was looking at, and even run through the "picture" in my mind and find what I'm looking for. Play games like that, it might take a while but trust me, it is worth it.     Except for when you see something you don't want to see, then you have that picture stuck in your head...|`|BN4Gkjvcaa	Its normal sometimes.  Just exercise your brain, I had the same thing.  I just made myself start remembering things by "quizzing" or some other stuff with myself.

I went to the dermatologist and they put me on differin, tazorac, and duac. Hope this helps. Good luck!!|`|Sozc3MyFaa	Tretinoin is Retin A & that is known to cause the symptoms you describe.

ezI5HwRWaa	I'm sorry for what you've been through. You can say that it affected you, because it obviously did. The thing is, that is in the past (most of it). You need to take what you've learned from that, or think about what you've learned, and use it to move on with your life.     I'm sure that your friends care, but like you said they might not have been in that situation. They just don't know what to say. Most of my friends didn't know what to say to me when I was depressed also. It made me feel like they didn't care, but later on in life, I realized that they really did. I can't blame them for not knowing what to say.    If music inspires you, take that and imply it into your life. Do you play in instrument or write at all? Would you like to? Some people can express themselves and what they've been through so beautifully through their art and talents. It's a great way to get things out also.     Don't play a happy role for your friends also. If you feel like this depression is so bad that you want to kill yourself, you need to tell someone. If not your family, then a counselor who can get you help or an adult you trust. It is never worth it to take your life. You might think that your friends and family won't care, but I've been able to see what it could be like if I had killed myself. My best friend was the reason I didn't. Later on I ended up helping him through a hard time and I know I've helped other people too through all of the bad things I've been through. If I had killed myself, I wouldn't be there to do that. Don't give up on yourself. Speak out and help people who are going through what you are. Write about it, sing about it, cry if you have to to get it out.     Be as positive as you can. Your life won't stop and wait for you. You will get older, the present will become the past, and new experiences will come your way. Don't be afraid of them. Living your life the best that you can makes it the most worth it. Don't let depression hold you back from your life.|`|nc1whD2Daa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

Does seeing certain people make you feel depressed? Once you answer these questions, I think you'll be able to get over it. Once you know what causes your depression, you'll be able to heal.     Your past will stay with you but how you learn from it dictates your future. A person that I was close to hurt me very deeply emotionally. They are no longer in my life, and that was one reason that I was able to heal. I wish I would have told them what they did to me because I feel like it wouldn't have taken so long to get over it. If it is your dad who has caused your depression, maybe you should talk to him about what he did to you emotionally.
3MM64geHaa	I don't know how you define childhood and quite frankly you sound like a typical teen.

a4kTbjfeaa	Nose or mouth --> pharynx (throat) --> larynx --> trachea (windpipe) --> mainstem bronchus (right and left) --> bronchioles--> alveoli    More info:   http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gra...|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Through the nares to the nasal cavity. Down your throat and past the epiglottis. Through the larynx to the trachea. The trachea bifurcates into the main stem bronchi. The trachea and bronchi are distinguished by semicircular cartilage in the trachea and circular cartilage in the bronchi. It's semicircular in the trachea to allow the esophagus to pass food. The bronchi diminish in size until they become bronchioles which are bronchi without the cartilage.These are held open by connective tissue that is between the alveoli and bronchioles. The bronchioles become mixed with alveolar like structures and then are called respiratory bronchioles. These then become alveoli.

Im 17 Btw and noticed when I left school (Im from uk) I realised that all the girls from our school were acting fake and changing there appearances dramatically just to get to attention (from the wrong kinda guy ofcourse).    One thing I have to say to you is be happy with who you are, don't change to try and fit in and be someone your not just to be liked by guys. It's not worth it you'll get all the wrong sorts of attention.    And it's good that your a virgin, don't let anyone pressure you like that, only do it when you really feel you want to and you can see a future between you both ( Of course pass 18 XD)    Some guys can be shallow and only think about appearance but trust me were not all bad :)  it may take a little time but I'm sure you'll find your mister right.|`|SgG2m5zNaa	i am like you :) i am not fat, but i'm nt skinny. somewhere in the middle. and i had a boyfriend who though i was beautiful :D you just have to find a good one! the ones who will only date you if you are skinny means they would be embarassed to date a chubby girl and you deserve sooo much better!    :D good luck! go for nice guys who wont pressure you to do anything. i found mine at church! :D|`|sHLpsJ30aa	hell no first ur 15 next trust me if you are nice you will find the right one|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	some guys are into very skinny chics...they are usually the ones who can't decipher fantasy from reality.  there is nothing wrong with you.  i'm sure you are beautiful|`|wue7sDOBaa	me personally i wouldnt say i like all types of girls. but as long as your not overweight (apologies to anyone who is this is just my opinion) i wont discriminate against you. so in answer to your question the (fairly obvious) answer is no. im sure your lovely and be patient someone will come along|`|hofFm31Jaa	well im a girl and i am skinny but i dont think you have to be skinny for a boy to like you.boys dont like me because im skinny( well they might but i dont know),they like me for my personality and for the way that i act.so if you have a good personality and are nice to them and everyone else then all the boys will like you ,trust me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8EyzZ0xWaa	I'm a 15 year old guy.

7f9c713357347968d139062ca48baf0caa	I have the same problem! I cant seem to remember to drink water on a regular basis and sometimes I try to make up for it by chugging down a big glass of water. Whenever I do that I feel just as you described, like I was about to explode! As for a reason why you and I have this reaction, I have no clue, but I do have a trick for you on drinking more water without feeling that way.    The key is moderation, you can do as I have done and carried around a water bottle all day as a reminder and drink the set amount gradually over the course of the day...    OR    Every time you eat a meal have a small glass of water, and gradually as your body gets used to water increase the amount.    :) hope this works for you!|`|2VtkgzcIaa	Set a schedule. Drink a glass in the morning when you wake up and a couple of hours before you go to sleep. Drink a glass at every mean (which should be 3). That's five glasses right there, that's a good way to start. Once you get in the habit, you will start drinking it on your own.|`|ea6xqoIPaa	always pee..
tPKGgYmuaa	What? I'd go to the doctor about that. Are you sure it's your taste buds and not some film coating your tongue?
kfg1Sw72aa	Err... this isn't really a question but that's good! if your body was lacking vitamins you may feel a huge change, i feel its always better to take fruits instead of vitamins though,  a lot more natural and tasty =D|`|WNTzcc6saa	Your body likes stuff that helps it run well! Don't overdo it, though. Sounds like you're not, though.
52e7jxDjaa	you have a cold.  your nose is stopped up...it is a smell staying in your nasal passages.  chill out,  it is either a cold or another bug.|`|1FqWhSMXaa	thats what happends when your sick, you will be better in a week|`|5LWq12epaa	take your temperature
YEd9Q5KZaa	Nope. You have to push the actual tampon out of the applicator.  Stop when the applicator, or outer tube, is completely inside the vagina.   Once the applicator is inside of you, use your index finger to push the inner tube (the tube where the removal string is connected) through the outer tube.   Once the inner tube is all the way in, use your thumb and middle finger to remove the applicator or outer tube. Make sure that the string hangs outside of the vaginal opening.|`|xggSASTwaa	yes when it is cardboard! i hate cardboard applicators! what you need to do is get plastic applicators and they will go in alot easier and with out the other part going in!|`|Lz3cLi6Gaa	Okay both go inside you then you pull the applicator out once the tampon is in place.|`|5lt2MIC4aa	There should be a line to let you know where to stop, but yes you put it in then push the smaller tube into the bigger one and then pull the plastic/cardboard part out and leave the string in until you're ready to change it (:|`|HKI6CSTQaa	okay well if you look in the box of tampons there are usually instructions on how to put one in. But no you put the appliator in at first then push of on the stick thing tht move and then take the applicator out and then there should be a string hanging down from you. (this is for plastic applicators btw)|`|AA12185077	yes, then when its in you pull the applicator back out.|`|XkuR8ZJPaa	Yes it does go inside but then you take it out once the tampon is in place.  Try this website it seemed to have a lot of information and some pictures.    http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon....
RXI8ImdIaa	Ok.    First, there's a problem here. No syringe that uses mL is going to be marked off in 6 lines to a mL. Count again. It's probably going to be 5 or 10 marks per mL. Maybe 4, but that's rare.    You've stated that your drug comes in a concentration of 2.5mg per mL.     Are you supposed to give a dose of .25mg? If so, your dose is 0.1 mL.     I can't tell you what line it is on the syringe because I think you're wrong about the measurements.
eekwpTMRaa	so im pretty sure you cant just tell yourself to go on a strict diet for like a year and actually follow through! you should check out my profile, i really want to be a diabetes dietititan  and i have read A LOT and my mom has  a DD and so i am totally prepared to help you! do not, i repeat, DO NOT do a colon cleanse or try and "clean out" your digestive system, that just is unhealthy and your body naturally cleans and heals itself anyway. It just makes you lose energy and stuff, so anyways i will help you. im too trying to lose weight and we can work together. i have a couple tips i could give you now, but if you email me i will reply with some questions and facts about me and how i will help ya out, if thats okay with you.     you need to eat lots of fruits! i lost my second chin last year by drinking TONS of water and green tea-brewed, never bottled and it was amazing! i also had an orange at breakfast, an apple at school-precut and whatnot and a banana after school. one of the very first things i learned about getting your serving of fruit is to get the real thing rather than the drink b/c you only get some of the nutrients and tons of sugars in the drink when you could get fiber from your fruits!   eat lots of veggies. i was about to suggest sparkteens to you, but i just noticed that you already have one, i have one too, i havent recorded in a while but i did do some of the workouts and its great! good luck, hope you email me!|`|AA11333543	start off small steps by replacing fatty meats with lean ones(chicken,turkey, shrimp,fish)... then gradually eat fiber everyday... but too much at one point will make you bloated i made that mistake and its not fun....then you should know this fruit and veggies.... i found that these are low and calories and you can eat as much as you want...  mushrooms,carrots,grapefruit,broccoli,... affect your pee smell),grape tomatos,celery,zucchinni,cucumber, bell peppers,apple,asian pear,...just to name some..then drink water all day...might make you go to the restroom alot but water weight will go off first... then beans with brown rice make a complete protein without all the fat... i lost weight following these guidelines.... i walk alot too its the easiest form of exercise|`|Gn91FVdBaa	You need to act seriously on this. The gym will only help if you are burning more calories than you put in. Try this diet  Breakfast - 1 cup of cereal with 1/2 banana sliced up on it. Pick a high fiber one like all bran. Not toasted muesli or sugary varieties.    Lunch - 100g (3.5 oz) can of tuna in spring water and salad or a sandwich on grainy bread with salad and chicken or ham. Scrape of butter if you desire.    Dinner - 100g (3.5 oz) of any meat with steamed veg or salad.    You are allowed 2 apples throughout the day as snacks but that is it. Do not eat pasta, rice, fried food or snack on bread.    Do not snack! I can not stress this enough. We are always told that eating lots of small meals is best. This is not true!! Snackers generally consume more calories. Another common trap is eating fat free and low fat foods but they are often loaded with sugar so be aware. Read lables and educate yourself of calorie content. As for the exercise you need cardio to burn fat. running and spin classes are best. Personally I hate exercise so I won't harp on it too much. I am 5 8" and weigh 121 pounds by following this diet so trust me it will work you just need to stick to it.|`|EIzs2OWeaa	oh. Yeah keep on doing what your doing.|`|4a635ec44438b74d7ce28e54d411c447aa	It will work, but it wont be fast. It took you 2 years to gain all that weight and it's probably going to take that long to completely get rid of it. While that may sound horrible, that's what its gotta be. If someone tells you this great acai berry drink will help you lose weight, don't believe it. I'm going to give you some tips that if you take to heart, will make your work a lot easier.    1. Low carb/ calorie diets do NOT work. I'm a biochemist, and I can tell you that if you starve your body and then try and exercise you will be in serious danger. You need to eat a balanced diet. Fruits, veggies, carbs, protein, healthy fats. If you're hungry, you should be eating, although that doesn't have to be a lot.    2. exercise regularly. Try and get into a habit. It'll take 3 solid weeks of going every other day before your body gets used to the idea...you need to stick it out for atleast 3 weeks before this'll get easier. The best thing you can do is join a group fitness class. They're in the mornings as well as afternoons, and people will be able to answer questions correctly, and they'll push you farther than you would on your own.    3 I love that you are using hte weights as well. The best way to burn more calories is to use the weights before you use the elliptical. It'll be harder, but it'll work.    Please do not use crash diets. Losing weight like you want to is a lifestyle change, not a temporary thing. If you want to keep the weight off you will need to eat healthy and exercise for the rest of your life, or the weight will just come back. I wish you the best.|`|s9ZAiqJOaa	try to have a strict diet with fiber and grains with natural fruit juices and complex carbohydrates exercise everyday for an hour and maybe try yoga it may make you lose weight and be confident hoped i helped  also eat small portions every other hours to keep you from getting hungry , hungry means more eating and no fats fast food or try less fried foods
iOOw74DXaa	i constantly have that and i have my whole life. i dont remember the name of what its caleed but your body is get a sufficient amount of air it just feels like your not, so what you need to do is relax and just try to breathe normally, if it never goes away then thats fine you hardly notice it after a while but in the mean time i would see a doctor just in case. for now just try to brethe normally, get a glass of water and relax. take nice deep breathes.|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Possible anxiety.

WXExyAlWaa	Neatness is only one manifestation of OCD. Basically it's obsessive - a thought that stays in your mind that you can't get rid of; compulsive - the compulsion to do some action; disorder - affects your life in a negative way.    It could be something like the irrational feeling that if you step on a crack in the pavement something horrible will happen, or having to check the lock on your door three times because you can't shake the thought that it's been left unlocked even though you already checked it, or any other intrusive thought or idea that affects your behaviour.|`|3MM64geHaa	Do you have obssessive thoughts-- thoughts that you can't get out of your head or things you are highly focused on?  Do you do certain behaviors repeatedly like washing hands or checking to see the door is locked?  OCD does not mean you are neat.|`|VV6rMXcraa	'OCD is a mental disorder most commonly characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts resulting in compulsive behaviors and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform.'

The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.     The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.     The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.

hQenGw76aa	Ok first of all you are a perfect weight and I do understand where you are coming from! I have stretch marks on my thighs too but its usually cus you grow too fast, now DONT cut back on meals a day! You should eat at a maximum of 3-4 hours a day! You should eat more meals a day but littler portions! This keeps your metabolism going through out the day to burn off everything its not god not to eat cus then your metabolism stops! Trust me dont be afraid to wear a swimsuit i no i no i was too but guys would rather see a women with curves then see a women all bones, trust me for my job i have done surveys! they want a WOMEN not a twig! lol! Dont be depressed! Just eat more a day and healthier and try and do at least a 30 min cardio work out every other day! And yes like the gentlemen said below acai berry is AMAZING, i have tried it and LOVE IT! If thats the way you wanna go, go for it! But hunny your fine! Need anything feel free to email me!|`|8eeKI0h0aa	There's nothing wrong at all. If i could offer you one bit of advice, i would suggest you change your exercise regime from ,"once in a while", to every day..good luck.|`|nN8D64Yzaa	your story sounds a lot like how mine started out. little insecurities, trying to see if you can go without a few meals, checking out the pro-ana sites and being freaked out by them...it got me down as well and after awhile i started starving myself every 3 weeks or so. i thought i had everything under control and that i didn't actually have a problem, but i've gone 3 weeks now without eating a proper days worth of food, and i've become extremely obsessed about food. it's really taking over my life and i'm trying to get help for it now because it's out of control. and it all started with little things just like you've explained above.     i don't know exactly how to help you, but just try to change the way you think now before it takes over your mind. remind yourself that if you're at a healthy weight, you're healthy and everyone else will see you as such. stretch marks are part of life, everyone has them, and they're not worth worrying about. eat food when you're hungry, stop when you're full. don't deprive yourself, and hopefully you'll get over your warped thinking before you end up messed up like me. good luck :)|`|SgaUGKoUaa	I dont think you should worry, your only 15 and thats normal at that age belive it or not. i know its not what you want to hear but its true. I was the same way, i knew i wasnt fat but i was getting stretch marks on my legs and was really embarassed to wear a bathing suit, especially when all my friends were toothpicks. what could be happening is that your body is changing from a kid, it will happen to your friends too, eventually even if you dont think so. thats what everyone told me and i knew they were wrong but sure enough at the end of sophmore year in high school and through my senior year i've noticed the other girls having a not so toothpick frame anymore.     so you basically have said in your question all the things that i went through and did, and my advice is dont do it you'll end up eating more if you dont eat. obviously eating a bag of candy wont do you any good, but its alright to have a cerial bar in the morning, and bring an apple or something to school, so when you get home you dont feel like you want to pig out, or feel like its ok to eat a little more because you havent eaten anything all day. just eat in moderation, and excersise like you said you do. so just cheer up, people usally only notice their tiny flaws that noone else sees rather than all the good things about them. just have fun and dont worry about it your only 15 once!|`|UkhaWSz4aa	Alright don't listen to Dixie...just try eating nothing with carbs in it for a month and see if that does anything..should help|`|b4Ha48Avaa	It is making you depressed because you care about your appearance.    All you really have to do, is watch what you eat, and walking helps.      **Count your calories**  make sure you get your 2000 calories a day, no more than that.  stay away from sodas and stick to juices, water, GREEN TEA, and other things like that.    cocoa butter or stretch mark cream can help with stretch marks,  and when you lose weight they'll start to go away.  [Mine did]    I did this diet and it works.  also, if your going to eat meat, chicken is less fattening than beef and pork.    School lunches are usually high in calorie.  so try not to get extras .    Hope you feel better about yourself!|`|FxAD44Moaa	your mother's on weight watchers?  good god,   she's on a processed foods diet?    that's  one of the worst things  she can do to herself.    and putting you on such a crap diet is even worse!      eat fresh whole foods instead..   fresh fruits and vegetables...   NO DAIRY  NO PROCESSED FOOD!    weight watchers is a scam..  it's been declared as one..   why people still go for it is beyond me.   weight watchers has been known to have a very high failure rate.    it's poor quality food, a bad rating system and it backfires  90%  of the time.    and no don't try acai berry products..  why not just  stop all together now and reverse yourself.. NO MORE JUNK!    no more scams.. no more diets.      eat right!      i eat fresh whole foods.. never had weight problems and i'm healthy, happy and my body is not 'clumpy'  or oddly proportioned.|`|VCyY0WOQaa	u must be gay

You are 16 with two kids and are HIV positive? Once you have HIV there is no getting rid of it as there is no cure for HIV. There are medications which can suppress the viral activity and prevent complications leading to a longer life. If you are truly HIV positive you must see a doctor and start treatment and become educated about HIV. If you are sexually active you must use protection (condoms) or better yet abstain. The doctor can refer you to a social worker if you need help dealing with this.   Here is more info on HIV:   http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutor...|`|aEpxcZcaaa	You cannot get rid of hiv..you can get medication to keep it under control tho..you need a hiv Specialist.|`|0Yg4RIqbaa	i am sorry but you can't , I know you are scared but you need to see a doctor who can educate you on the many advances that have transpired since this disease became prevalent in the early eighties.  Your fear is mostly based on what you do not know about the disease and/or your fears how this revelation would affect your relationships with your friends/family and children.  Just remember you are not the first, and unfortunately not the last, but you are in control of the decisions you make from this day forward.  The choices you make today will dictate the quality of life you will lead tomorrow.  Don't delay and wish you only the best.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	There is NO cure for HIV, but medications can help people who have HIV live longer, healthier.  You need to see a doctor who specializes in treating HIV, to give yourself the best chance to live longer, healthier.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	You can't get rid of HIV, ever.  You can only treat it.  If you are positive HIV then you must be on treatment for it, as your doctor wouldn't let you walk out of the office without giving you prescriptions.  You'll have it forever.  Why do you need to tell anyone?  And how are people going to find out?  I think if you were diagnosed as HIV positive you would have had counselling and been educated hugely on the disease by your doctor.

uwBRwINvaa	Go to a dentist and get them extracted. If they are loose u must have over 8mm pockets and when your bone has gone down that much there really isn't any turning back.   Dentures will be a good option or either a partial. Honestly if u are able to save some teeth especially on the bottom, bottom dentures are so hard to keep in securely so try to save some teeth and keep up with your dental hygiene a partial will be good for you.   Have you gone to a dentist and got x-rays? I would they can give you options that will get you out of pain. If you have dental insurance get checked if not, find a dental school and go to them it may be cheaper than an actual office since its students.    Keep flossing your teeth that can help bone lose to stay where it is u instead of losing more. And keep brushing but don't use these as treatments cause without a check up from your dentist(s) the problem will keep going.   -GOOD LUCK- I know how mouth pain can be and i would get that checked out soon|`|FnesEgISaa	Wow that really sucks.

NrOJ24hSaa	Well, if you asked their opinion about what you should do about a problem, then you should probably just expect it. When they do say it, politely tell them that therapy/pills haven't worked for you and that you genuinely want THEIR opinion about what you should do. That should get actual advice out of them (however don't be surprised if they aren't comfortable giving it, most people don't want that kind of responsibility). If you are just chatting with someone and they say you should get help (unless this issue is extremely serious like suicidal urges or an eating disorder) then they are being rude and nicely tell them that you appreciate their input but that it really isn't any of their business. Best of luck :D|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	I have no idea if you believe in a God or not but I say turn to him...Like I said if your atheist then please accept my apologies but I suggest that you next time explain your problems so that way ppl have a better understanding of how to help always remember there is hope out there & what the therapists may not tell you a total stranger could what ppl suffering from depression anxiety stress or any other form of mental illness need is support
wipJ9OE7aa	Well, I don't know what your diagnoses is, but I do think that sometimes is is reasonable and necessary. It really just depends on which tooth it is. All teeth can't be treated exactly the same. I have had 2 root canals, one was crowned and I got a bridge after having one removed, so again it just depends on the situation.    I am hoping that your dentist is recommending that you get a crown because it's necessary. Sometimes after the dentist do everything necessary to prepare a tooth for a filling, they find that your tooth needs more depending on where the cavity (or whatever needs to be removed) was. A crown is created for two reasons, to protect your tooth and to provide support when there isn't enough. A crown isn't a substitution for a filling.I found something on Wikipedia that explains it a little better:  "In a situation where there is not enough remaining solid tooth structure after decay and fragile tooth structure is removed, or the tooth has fractured and is now missing important architectural reinforcements, the tooth might very well require an extracoronal restoration: a restoration consisting of a dental material that will exist around the remaining tooth structure to a varying degree. Restorations that fall into this category include the various types of crowns and onlays... "
2dfd3c8c6b41e357078ce270679d8fcfaa	sounds like an infection.  Have it treated - a Doc can clean the wound best and you may need a simple antibiotic to make sure you clear up and to make sure you have not contracted a "Staph" (pronounced Staff) infection....these can be difficult to treat and can be very dangerous.|`|VMRnPP1haa	go to a foot doctor asap!!
CZ1nO9C9aa	Don't listen to the other people.  I guarantee you there is more truth to my answer than theirs.  Here's what you need to know:    The smell goes away usually within an hour, unless you're hotboxing a car or something like that.  Ventilation and fresh air usually makes the scent go away quickly.  However, joints and blunts are more stinky than smoking a bong or bowl or something like that.    Perfume can help cover it up, but like I said, it usually goes away within an hour.    You'll get red eyes and your eyes will sag.  Use Visine or Clear Eyes after you smoke and your eyes will clear right up in less than 10 minutes.  You can't really do anything about the sagging eyes, but you can just say you're tired or something as an excuse.  If you act normal, people won't know you're high.    Being high can make you act stupid.  It affects everyone differently because it changes your perceptions of things ... and everyone has different perceptions to begin with.  Some people can function better when high, some people curl up in their beds and can't do anything.  You'll have to see how it affects you.  Generally, the better mindset you are in when you smoke, the better time you will have.    Some people act dazed and confused after they smoke.  It all depends on how much you've smoked and how marijuana affects you personally.  If you take one or two puffs then you should be ok.    It tastes really good ... especially when you get your hands on high quality buds.  There are strains that taste like blueberry and stuff like that.    It can make you more outgoing and fun.  If you smoke with your close friends, then you'll probably have a great time and be more outgoing.  Some people get paranoid if they are high in public or around people they don't know.  It depends on your genetics and mindset.    The first time you do it, just remember to have a sense of humor about it.  It's just a drug ... it's not harmless but smoking it once isn't going to hurt you.  Some people don't get high their first time.  Other people get panic attacks their first time, but you should be fine if you relax.  And about the sense of humor, you might start getting lost in your thoughts or feel like you're going crazy.  You aren't.  It's just the weed.  Being high can make you feel insane sometimes.  Notice it, experience it, but don't get caught up in it.    There have been episodes of people who've smoked and never really returned to their normal state of mind ... this is depersonalization/derealization, and it usually happens when you let the drug take you over.  You get caught in your thoughts and you become delusional and start thinking you're insane.  Some people recover, some people don't.  This is somewhat rare though, so you shouldn't worry about it.    It can make you really happy ... that's why it's called getting high.    It can make you sleepy .... it can also make you hyper.  Different kinds of weed combined with different mindsets cause different things to happen.    If you are smart, you'll be able to think straight and function, that is, unless you're really, really high.  You might get really, really high for your first few times until your tolerance decreases.    People can take advantage of you when you're high.  They usually won't if you don't act stupid while you're high.  You can control yourself while high and act normal if you try, though sometimes it is hard.  It takes responsibility and maturity.    It is psychologically addictive, not physically.  If you smoke more than a couple times a week then it can be hard to quit for some people but you should be okay ... if you smoke everyday then it can be really hard to quit.    Also, you shouldn't smoke if you're having depression, anxiety, mental illness, or problems with interpersonal relationships or making friends.  It makes all these things worse.  Trust me.    It can't cause cancer.  It can't cause death.  It has never, ever, ever happened, ever.  It has carcinogens that don't affect humans.    And finally, don't become a stupid pothead.  Use weed ... don't abuse it.  Getting high all the time for personal entertainment is selfish and a waste of time ... unless you actually do things when you're high, like play music, create art, have crazy conversations with people, or explore the woods or something.  Sitting around watching TV or listening to music can be really cool at first when you start smoking, but there is a point where you're just wasting your life away.|`|dCF1UBUsaa	You smell like weed. A little bit.  Chew gum.  Very easy to tell, red eyes and glossy, spaced out look.  Eye drops help quite a bit sometimes.  Doesn't make you act stupid.  More like relaxed, uplifted mentally, can be dazed, everything seems better.  Food is amazing.  Depends if you get indica or sativa. High vs. Stoned.  A lot of people do not get high the first couple of times.   You get a case of "I don't give a ****" and stresses disappear temporarily.  Very happy. Paranoia may set in for some.  Hyper sometimes on indica strain.  Depends how high you are. You'd have to be stupid high to be taken advantage of.  Not the substance itself, but the state of being high is.    If you do it, don't do anything stupid like drive or go to school or work. Be in a fun, safe place with some friends.|`|aKITLyeRaa	The way U asked it...    Can say tht neither the Questions nor U are Clear in nethng.......    Juz plain old paper with Nothing in it........|`|7gBCWyhyaa	I do not smoke weed. But I have several friends who do.    The smell does get into the clothes you're wearing pretty well. But of course, it is dependent on how long you've been smoking for and how much you've been smoking. Some perfumes do pretty well, but most people wear a jacket or something while they're smoking and then take it off later, if they're wanting to hide the smell.  You do have bad breath but gum covers it up easily.  For some people it's easy to tell if they're high. Some peoples eyes get more watery and redder than others. But, of course, it's dependent on how much you've smoked.  Weed doesn't exactly make you act stupid, but your response time is definitely slower and the choices you make can sometimes be choices that you wouldn't normally make.  When smoking weed you're definitely a little dazed, (again. Dependent on how much you've smoked.)  Everything tastes the same, but you do get 'the munchies'. Smoking weed affects different people in different ways. Some people can be more outgoing, and some people can be more kept to themselves.  Your problems do not go away. x) You're still aware of them, but I suppose they're at the back of your mind at the time.  You're not necessarily 'happy' when smoking weed, but you're usually more relaxed. Being hyper is possible, but not very common.  While high you can still think straight. It's not like alcohol where people can just 'take advantage of you'.   And finally, the drug itself is not addictive. But the feeling of being high is usually addictive for most people.    Hope I helped.|`|SgaUGKoUaa	if you don't wanna smell i strongly suggest doing it outside, you dont smell that way i, and perfume helps, or lotion... i usually wash my hands after though cause i smell it on my fingers haha.    for breath just pop in some minty or fruity gum, or have some kind of drink that has a strong smell... plus you might want a drink with you anyway in case your one of those people that gets kotton mouth really bad.    some peoples eyes get red, some don't, mine do really bad sometimes so eye drops i would recommend haha. also  your eyes can get squinty    depending on your mood and the people your around smoking can make you just really happy and you think everything is funny, or you just chill there and think about a lot... you think everything is really clear and you understand it, but good luck explaining it to other people lol    and yes things taste amazing... which is a problem if you get the munchies really bad    as far as outgoing and fun goes, it really depends on your personality, or who your with. but i guess for some people it brings them out more    first time usually doesn't do anything.. it took three times for anything to happen to me.. i have a friend who's first time she supposedly got really high but who knows    you forget about your problems for the time being, at least i do but they always come back when your sober    you can think straight, i drive and blaze at the same time, and its not like being drunk where people swerve or your vision is impaired and you crash into a pole... although if your one of those people who uncontrollably laugh i don't recommenced driving...i have friends like that and they're scary to be in a car with while they're blazed.. i can drive because i always have control over my high, and its kinda relaxing to drive like that     its not addictive, and most people say its not. i do it every day but, three weeks ago i decided to not do it for a month to see if i would have some kind of craving to do it, and i don't im absolutely fine      hope that helped i helped :]|`|tFcsLR7Maa	Do you smell bad? Doees perfume cover it up? Yes, but not always sometimes u can put perfume on but still reak like a pound.    Breath? Drink water then gum. Your lips probably smell, and its on ur hands/fingers. Wash ur hands too.   Red eyes.. is it easy to tell you've smoked?  Eye drops? Yeah eyes get red. Eye drops help.   Does smoking make you act stupid? LOL. depends on what kinda weed ur talking about. Some give u an upper some a downer. Some make u slow some make u talkative. Some put u to sleep.   or like out of it and dazed? ^^  Everything tastes good right? pretty much.   Does it make you more outgoing and fun? No, but sometimes it makes u not worry about things like people that piss u off. Just gives me more patience.  First time you do it.. does it have an effect on you? It can if u inhale properly.  Do your problems go away? Nope, sometimes i get high and think about em even more. LOL. It makes u focus alot thats why. But at the end of the day problems are still there.Gives me more patience to deal with them.  Are you happy? Hungry, Happy, High.   Or hyper?  Can you think straight or can people take advantage of your highness? Yes i can think straight. Sometimes better. If i was sleepy to begin with and i smoke I'll probably get extra tired. But it just mellows u down.   Addictive or not? Need it No. Want it Yes.|`|zWDVaytXaa	first, i'm gonna say don't listen to anyone's advice who hasn't smoked weed before. (not directing this at anyone who answers this question but honestly, if you haven't tried it you don't know what the **** you are talking about, it's different for every person.)    with that said, i've been smoking for a while, anywhere from once a week or two to up to five times a day.    Do you smell bad? Doees perfume cover it up?    You smell for around 5-10 minutes, then only your hair (if smoke went through it which it usually will even if you are careful) breath, and hands. alot of people overlook your hands but those are usually what stink the most except for your breath.    perfume, axe, almost anything can cover it up. chew a piece of gum, and stay outside for a bit once you are done smoking and you'll be fine.      Red eyes.. is it easy to tell you've smoked?    My eyes get so red it looks like they are hemmorraging, so i carry eyedrops with me everywhere i go. since i've been using eyedrops i haven't been caught in the actual act in three years.    i take the bottle, hold it up to the corner of my eye, lean my head back  and then just keep squeezing gently until i feel the wet sensation in my eye.    Does smoking make you act stupid?    honestly yeah, it definitely makes me more stupid at times, but it also lets you see things from a different view. i feel dumb, like as if there's something missing from my brain until i sleep and wake up the next day and then i'm completely normal after a few hours of waking up.\    but it does **** with my memory, i can remember everything that happens when i'm high, but when i'm not and trying to learn and remember things it's a bit harder.    Everything tastes good right?     weed amplifies all my senses and feelings. that being said, everything tastes great, your kitty feels even softer than he really is, and things hurt more (but usually i'm so high it doesn't even phase me)    Does it make you more outgoing and fun?    when i'm high i want to say hey to everyone i see, it doesn't really make me more fun , maybe funny just if i say stupid ****.    First time you do it.. does it have an effect on you?    frequently people don't get high their first time, but usually that's because they don't know how to inhale correctly. i got semi-high my first time then completely blitzed out of my mind the 2nd.    inhale on the piece or whatever you are smoking out of and you'll see it ember (the weed gets red) and there shouldn't be much smoke coming off the weed that you can see, it should be going in the pipe.  suck for a few seconds or whatever is comfortable to you (you'll be able to take bigger hits as you smoke more and don't worry about coughing, it's natural and you are smoking after all)    then get off the pipe and inhale a few breaths of just normal air, this will make sure that the smoke gets to your lungs. then hold it for as long as you can. the problem is that most people just keep the smoke in their mouth and don't really inhale it all.    Do your problems go away?    sometimes i forget about them so yeah, other times i purposely smoke to help deal with them and try to think things out. but usually i just smoke to have fun and be happy.    Are you happy?    definitely, it's actually one of the few things in life (right now) that make me happy no matter what's going on.  Or hyper?    depends on the weed but no, it usually just makes me happy and have alot more fun, alot of people say it chills them out but i'm chill all the time so lol..    Can you think straight or can people take advantage of your highness?     i've acted straight probably over 500 times (not exaggerating) infront of my parents, never once have they asked me "are you high?!?" because of something i said. it would be because of my eyes or the scent, but eyedrops and be smart and you're fine. and no people can't take advantage of me because i'm high, you still have your mind there just your thought process|`|y05fKgDWaa	1) I smell hella good. Asuming alota smoke got on you, a little perfume will kinda throw off the smell and alota perfume will just smell ***** naseating  2) Use Visine or Systane if you gotta go somewhere clear eyed. Your eyes are still gonna look lazy if you already dont have lazy eyes when sober  3) If your new to it youl probably laugh a shizload and will look and act stoned or goofy. If your not a new smoker you can usually keep it real but even we space out and act dazed, thats just how it is being blazed.lol i rhymed  4)  Sheeit does taste goooood and sometimes its hella hard to stop eating  5) It can make you more outgoing and fun and other times youll be stuck sitting down thinkin about anything and in your own world. Depends on if your with you homies or if your alone somewhere or around strangers and even the type of dojia your smokin.  6) Doesnt make your problems literally go away but eases your mind so your not busy worrying about em. And you can think and find a solution to a problem even  7) Yes your happy and you can sometime be hyper. Like I explaind in 5  8) No ones gonna take advantage of "your highness" lmao  9) NOT addictive, but habit forming    I ***** love smokin weed. Peace|`|IMvg8zajaa	Do you smell bad? Doees perfume cover it up?  I don't smell bad, expect when right after i smoke, and it smells good in my opinion, but yea, perfume(cologne) covers it up  Breath?  Nothing really bad, I mint will stop it, again, only after i smoke  Red eyes.. is it easy to tell you've smoked?  YES  Eye drops?  I'd recommend you use them  Does smoking make you act stupid?  Sometimes, But depends on what you mean by stupid, if the mean the above the influence cow thing, no.  or like out of it and dazed?  This, depending on how much you smoke  Everything tastes good right? lol  Mostly, like stale cerial was good, lol  Does it make you more outgoing and fun?  Of course, you laugh at everyones jokes, it's great, you just want to go out and lay down and watch the sunset  First time you do it.. does it have an effect on you?  Some people it does, It's cause most people don't inhale their first time  Do your problems go away?  Yeps  Are you happy?  yes  Or hyper?  Depends on what type you get(strain)  Can you think straight or can people take advantage of your highness? haha  Sometimes they can, if they're trying to make me laugh, but i can think straight  Addictive or not?  Hell naw, I've been dry for 2 weeks, and haven't had any addiction problems
nARbbK56aa	Hi! My skin also keloids. I had two removed from my ears. I am 32 and I received a tattoo when I was 22. My skin wept, but that was it. I got the tat on my right shoulder. I have not had any problems in 10 years. You may want to see your doctor first.    I hope this helps! :-)|`|GM7Ar0SVaa	If you are prone to keloiding, piercings are strongly urged against. Tattoos can also lead to keloiding, although piercings and surgical modifications seem to be the most likely culprits. There's no real limit as to where keloids can form, as they can also grow on the tongue and other mucus membranes. The only way to truly prevent keloiding is to not get the tattoo or piercing in the first place. If you decide to chance it, just be aware that you may end up with excessive scarring and/or keloids. Keloids have to be removed with the help of medical treatment or surgery - you can't just wash them away.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	well you cant have keloids everywhere..,. surely you can get it in a spot you dont have keloids!?|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	No, unfortunately  not.  If you have a tendency to form keloids, you will tend to form them any time the skin is disturbed or damaged.  The very process of getting a tattoo will set off your immune system and make multiple entry points in your skin.  Nobody can predict what the end result of that will be and nobody can control it or prevent it happening.   In your case, it will be best to stick with the tattoos you put on the surface.|`|l7vDiKDzaa	If you are an idiot!!!|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    A person who has had a keloid should not undergo elective skin surgeries or procedures such as piercing.     The best way to deal with a keloid is not to get one. When it comes to keloids, prevention is crucial, because current treatments are often not completely successful and may not work at all.|`|AA11619466	NO! "Keloidformation: If you are prone to developing keloids -- scars that grow beyond normal boundaries -- you are at risk of keloid formation from a tattoo. Keloids may form any time you injure or traumatize your skin."
VNvVhDWgaa	Your anxiety attack may have caused the muscles to stiffen or something that made them sore. However, i would think it would be more likely that something else is going on. I would treat the symptoms first for a little while, like putting ice on it and using muscle rubs, perhaps a little anti-inflammatory medication like advil or aleve.    After 3 weeks, though, i would only give this a few days to see if it helps before going to my doctor and telling them what happened. Rule of thumb, if it last more than 1-2 weeks, go to the doctor.|`|dca629635b1afa455a0677ad8265ba17aa	costochondritis. its an inflammation in the chest wall. the cause is unknown.

Celery has almost no calories.  Cucumbers help reduce water retention and are very low in calories.|`|hQenGw76aa	Try things like "Boost" or "Carnation" drinks before bed! Drink them as a snack! The chocolate ones are reallyyyyyy good! And also eating before bed everyone thinks is bad but its not! Its actually good for you! You should try and eat at a maximum of every 3-4 hours a day, eat more meals with less portions, when you do this it keeps your metabolism going through out the day to burn everything off! and since you sleep for an average of 8 hours eating before bed is great! Try a fruit salad or fruit with yogurt its delicious and sure to satisfy the midnight cravings!! Hope this helps, need anything else just email!|`|76ac7cdd12842bb7648e869948fc1420aa	Green veggies, and fruits would be my suggestion, and water, lots and lots of water :)|`|FxAD44Moaa	don't eat before bed.      whatever it is you're doing,  you're starving yourself.      are we eating fresh  whole foods such as fresh fruits and veggies?    do you eat too much processed foods?  such as anything canned, frozen,  tv dinner, fast foods, dairy?  so on?    cut back on the junky empty calories and eat more whole foods.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	green apples,  they are only 50 cals and they expand in your stomach, making you feel fuller

Even though the treatment is going well I am sure it makes her very tired.  Cancer treatment usually does.   Only her doctor can tell you what kind of food she should be eating, if you doctor isn't being helpful you should get a second opinion he should never be to busy for one of his patients.  Just be there for her,   I am sure its hard for her to think positive being sick so  you wil have to be potitive enough for you both.  Just love her spend time with her.

P6NptCz8aa	They are supposed to in order to get into the holy land.     It's not painful and it's not wrong. It's clean and healthy.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Because it's forced on them as infants; they aren't given a choice in the matter.    Few men actually ever choose to be circumcised, as it damages the penis, sexual sensitivity and inhibits the complete enjoyment of sex that comes with having an intact and whole penis.    More and more Jews are questioning the practice of male genital mutilation, and there is even a group called "Jews Against Circumcision."    Female circumcision of minors is universally considered mutilation and an atrocity by all civilized countries, and is illegal.    Males should have the same protection.    I was a victim of male genital mutilation as an infant.     I was strapped down, assaulted, sexually molested and mutilated by the process called circumcision.       It wasn't done for "religious" reasons, but this abominable practice was spread far and wide in the USA by those who want to mutilate all males.    I'm restoring my foreskin, and can attest that the sensitivity regained, while not complete, is incredibly better, the orgasms more intense, and the feeling of having a complete penis is incomparable.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    And for the "religious" issue;  If God had wanted me to have a foreskin, I would have been born with one!!!"    ERIC|`|PAvYZJK2aa	it is part of their religion|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It's a sign of the covenant with god, it's in Leviticus or somewhere saying why it has to be done. Personally I think it's cruel and unnecessary. It's just symbolic, there are no medical reasons, but it's a pretty weird symbol IMHO and shouldn't be done to a baby who has no say in the significance!    Harriet|`|K4zsztkRaa	Circumcision is a covenant with God.  Jesus was Jewish and was circumcised 8 days after birth. Also God told Ambraham to circumcise himself and all the other males around him.    it's for sybolic belief.    But keep in mind circumcision back then was not what it is today. Today we remove the whole foreskin, back then they only took a little bit off.    -Connor|`|CNW6eAjoaa	It was supposed to have been a covenant with the god they worshipped.   Frankly, I cannot imagine a god asking his/her followers to mutilate their reproductive organs just so they can follow.   Many Jews now are realizing that circumcision is a barbaric ritual that causes excruciating pain to the infant, and for no good reason.  If you google Jews Against Circumcision, you will find a well established group that have abandonded the practice, much to the relief of their sons.  It is time to realize that physical mutilation of any sort has no place in a peaceful religion|`|jOFRD9sLaa	Hey, that is actually a myth that all Jewish men get circumcised. There are actually groups of Jewish men who do not practice this. The fact of the matter is, circumcision does not mean you're Jewish or that if you're Jewish you must be circumcised.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	as a deal with god|`|dOpKsNYcaa	Because in the old testament of the bible (Torah) God commands that the decedents of Abraham shall be circumcised on the 8th day of birth as part of his covenant with God and that all men bought into his house shall be circumcised as well. It's the mark of a Jew and meant to separate them as the chosen people from the Gentiles (or the uncircumcised).     Christians don't get circumcised because we are under the new covenant in Jesus Christ and the new testament says that if we are circumcised Christ will be of no benefit to us. So basically it's a religious practices that goes back for centuries. But like the previous poster said, not all Jews are still for circumcision. The procedure that is done today is far more aggressive type of circumcision that what was originally done in biblical times.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	God commanded them to circumcise as a sign of the covenant. Thats the one and only reason. Not all Jews circumcise however, here's some more information on non-circumcising Jews-    http://jewishcircumcision.org/  http://www.kahal.org/ (mostly in hebrew)  http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish-sha...  http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/  http://www.cutthefilm.com/Cut_Website/Ho...

If you aren't comfortable with how you are now, then change for that reason.|`|YAwvszITaa	you are not fat just tone up a little you don't have long to go just exercise and eat well|`|AA10350894	I would not go as far as to say you are fat, as such, but it sounds (and looks) as though you are well on your way!  Drop the fast food, do some exercises, and become more active and before you know it you'll trim back down. If you continue doing things the way you are now, you'll be pushing 200lbs by mid year! Right now you are at a weight were it can be relatively easy for you to slim back down, but the heavier you get... the harder it will be to loose the pounds.  165lbs is alright for a 5'10" plus person, but you are 5'6" you should be around 135-140lbs.|`|kgn1r1Scaa	i see man BOOBS|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	eat less fast foods|`|4CsGde1qaa	Okay okay, your really bad and I did not judge that from the photo you provided me with.

Don't feel bad though, I know how depressing it could be for others to make fun of you, especially everyday. I used to be in that situation. You may not know it, but probably 70% of this country is on a weight crises and you are not the only one. You are 18 years old, and i am 21. You are too young to give up, and you will rise again. Just exercise regularly and eat right. There are these 3 books that I recently bought(Eat this, not that; blue book, orange book nd yellow book), maybe they can help but you'll be the judge of that, but I think these books are amazing and good for life. take care and good luck!|`|IYjCDb8zaa	ur not like FAT ur just bigger boned looking|`|Pm9Q3yM7aa	i dont think your fat at all.

I suggest you put them on on the weakend when you dont work..|`|kpybyRIQaa	nope it does not hurt getting them on, it will feel really weird though, as in if the braces are sticking out 4 feet out of your mouth!They just use a device to hold your mouth open for awhile and a thing to make sure that your mouth stays dry by taking all of your siliva! It can be sensitive to your teeth (if they are sensitive) with the cold water they use. Other then that you will be fine.  Just make sure you get a lot of wax from your orthodontist so that when they scrape the inside of your mouth you can put it over them so the scrapes don't get worse|`|DaN5STNwaa	not while getting them on, but afterwords, your teeth will be sore. You will have to eat things like mashed potatoes and ramen, and things that dont need to be chewed alot.|`|G2wyTwy4aa	when they are actually putting the brackets on your teeth no it doesnt hurt a bit. but later on...couple of hours your teeth will be sore because  1 your teeth are getting used to it and  2 because your teeth are shifting already. when i first got my braces i ate alot before i got them on which was smart because you won't really be able to chew anything so make sure you keep soft items so eat such as soup, pudding and so forth. good luck! nd hope i helped!    p.s. they will only be sore for about 2-4 days after depending on the situation.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	Not at all. but, the first 2 days the inside of your mouth gets kinda puffy and swollen because the braces are poking the insides of ur mouth and it feels really weird to spit when you brush your teeth...it doesn't hurt nearly as bad as the spacers you get before
ptGhiqe3aa	Since your periods have always been kind of off, maybe that's just the case now.    You can always take a pregnancy test just to be sure.    Oh and stress can sometimes throw it off as well.  If you have been stressing over this for a week or so, that could cause it to be late too.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	If you're usually irregular, it's nothing to worry about. If your period is more than 2 weeks late, you should start worrying, but not just yet.    Mines crazy. Sometimes it comes within two weeks, sometimes its over a month.  If you get concerned take a pregnancy test, and if it comes back negative (and you still haven't gotten your period) go see a doctor.  As you already know condoms aren't 100%, so that COULD be the case (but if you checked then theres a good chance that's not what happened).     You know how when you stare at a clock, things seem to go by slower? Well that applies here. If you keep worrying and waiting for your period to come, it's not going to come. It's a mentality thing.    Uhh it can also be stress too (if you're stressing over this whole thing) cuz my friend was so stressed her period was late.  So calm down, try taking a pregnancy test, and if you're young (ie still in school and not married) consider taking birth control if you want to have sex.|`|AA10978412	have you tried a pregnancy test.?  or..  it could be coming late.?|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	I wont even read the question you're pregnant
ie5AKYToaa	I don't think you can hear a tendon tear. And if you did split your tendon, you wouldn't be able to move your shoulder since the tendon connects the muscle to the bone.    I split the tendon in my right hand a few years ago, and my hand was balled up into a fist. After I split it, I couldn't open my fist. So I think that you might have done something else to your shoulder.|`|aKITLyeRaa	Nop U cant hear it.......
a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	You should add in some protein so you don't get so hungry.  Also some whole grains, maybe some fiber to counteract the sugar rush.  Also some veggies since pineapple isn't bad for you by a long shot, but it doesn't have all the nutrients you need.    Try a nice broth- or water-based soup, like a veggie soup with some grains and legumes.  Eat some beans, a handful of nuts, some of that pasta with multi-grains and added protein.    You need to eat food with less sugar and more nutrients so you don't get too hungry between meals and you get the nutrition you need.  If you can cut back on sugar (added sugar, of course, but also fruits, especially fruit juices) and eat more veggies, you can get nutrients minus a lot of empty carb calories.    So, no, that wasn't enough.  Go eat more to balance out the fruit.|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	It can be good or bad depending on other factors.|`|oke8l2Boaa	it is good  for u, "it has high amounts of vitamin C,important for boosting the immune system and other bodily functions,it also contains thiamine, potassium, and manganese.

f8mLpPXlaa	After hyperventilating your CO2 is down therefore your breathing is more shallow.And if anybody disagrees you send them to me! lol.  Breathing is stimulated by two main things. CO2 which actually makes the blood more acidotic and stimulates the respiratory center in your brain across the blood-brain barrier for you to breathe deeper.It controls the diaphragmatic excursion via the phrenic nerve.  the other control mechanism is the O2. Low O2 stimulates the aortic and carotid bodies to speed up the heart and rate of breathing. Actually it's not the O2 itself or lack thereof it's the lack of oxygenated hemoglobin that stimulates these bodies.So these could be stimulated by loss of hemoglobin from bleeding or anemia.  So to get to your question, if you hyperventilate you are blowing off CO2 and therefore making your blood less acidotic and it will result in you not breathing as deeply.|`|aal4lYdKaa	slower because your trying to figure out what and why it happened
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	First, you can't really take your own pulse accurately. The minute you focus your attention on it, it will tend to speed up, and then speed up even more when you realize it is faster than you expected it to be.  You also are likely taking it wrong, and pressing too hard.  The blood is trying to force around the pressure, which is why you feel what you think are two beats.  You should not need much pressure at all to feel a pulse in the wrist, and should stop pressing as soon as you feel a bare beat.   If you just need to take your own pulse, I think you would find it easier and more accurate to use the side of your neck, just below where your  head/jaw is attached.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Should be count as seperate. You can go to the local store with a free machine and then ask the pharmasist to answer your question while he watches. I bet a nurse will come on and share their knowledge, there are so many nice ones on YA. Never a dumb question, this is actually a very good question.|`|1NWjta2jaa	Every beat counts. If you are so concerned about this, get one of those electronic pulse monitors.

nEVoabeSaa	They generate heat through exothermic crystallization of supercooled molten materials (usually sodium acetate) and are reusable. These can be recharged by boiling the warmers and allowing them to cool. Heating of the pads is triggered by snapping a small metal device buried in the pad which generates shock waves to initiate crystallization.
66a13bf9fc4f5831c5a727b2e71e3db9aa	Tea tree oil is a repellent. If that's what you have, use it. Be careful to not get it on painted or varnished surfaces. Can irritate mucous membranes. A few rare people have allergic reaction, i.e. redness, itching, burning.    A better essential oil is rosemary. Thirty drops of rosemary oil in 2 tablespoons of a base oil like olive oil, massage into scalp, wrap in plastic or wear a shower cap to keep the fumes in, wear 8 hours and then shampoo out. Kills lice, nits and conditions the hair. One to 2 drops of rosemary oil on the hair brush or in the final rinse after shampooing works as a repellent. Rosemary is not recommended for pregnant women or people with high blood pressure.    People with oily hair rarely get lice. People who use oil to style their hair rarely get lice. Most hair products sold in Europe contain rosemary oil.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I don't know how effective tea tree oil is. I do know that shampoo with lindane (the chemical to which you are referring) does work when used as directed.    I also know that tea tree oil burns the crap out of my skin, and lindane does not. So the harmfulness of one versus the other is debateable.    I guess you'll find out how well it worked if she starts itching in a few days :)  That's if she was exposed at all. Good luck, those bugs are a pain.    Post edit: eh, maybe I gave the wrong impression. Lindane is indeed harsh, I'm not arguing that. My experience though is tea tree oil gives me a terrible rash, burns, etc. The point is I'd be careful with that too.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I don't believe in "Rid" and things like that either.  Too many studies prove it worthless.  The tree tea oil will hopefully be enough to repel the pests.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    Oh man, I feel for your daughter.    I remember every year , for 4 years, when I went to camp I would get lice.  The counselors' would cover my scalp and hair in mayo, then wrap my hair in plastic wrap for 30 minutes.   You could do this for her in order to prevent the lice.|`|YX93lq4daa	This is by far the funnest thing I have seen all day..someone telling you tea tree is bad and to use lindane out of all things...lol    lindane is a neurotoxin. It is a chemical used in insecticides..please look it up..and do not use it on your child.    tea tree is wonderful for the scalp. I love using Ginvanni Triple treat shampoo.    It will be a great preventative measure. Neem oil(it is the oil from the fruit of a tree) could also be used. I do not care so much for the smell. It is a very strong nut smell. You would want to dilute it in some shampoo or an organic scalp oil.|`|DMhAPurkaa	I have heard that tea tree oil does work as a preventative.  Also Vinegar, as a rinse on the hair after shampoo, is a good preventative.  The vinegar closes the hair shaft and thereby makes it hard for the little buggers to hang on.  That s why it makes your hair shiny , it closes the hair shaft, and that reflects light better.  Heat is also an enemy to those varmints. This is why you wash and dry the bedding and all toys if they do get it; they cannot thrive in heat-  so use a Hair Dryer. No kidding. if there are any or eggs, they will collapse under the heat, so no more reproducing, and the eggs cannot thrive in heat also. They will shrivel .  Throw everything in the dryer.  Also if you can get hold of NEEM powder, it before and during an infestation. You can use it on gardens as a natural pesticide, on dogs for fleas, and on the scalp for these pesky human infeststions. Bugs hate it. Very purifying.It can be taken internally, also for different maladies. It is from the family of Mahogany trees. You can get it at a whole foods store, or an India grocery or online.  You re a good mom.  Thank you for all the care you are giving this little person .  She will be a wonderful person in the world one day because you loved her so much.    Ps some think lice are initially attracted to ones whose glucose levels in the blood are high..check out the site down here...
Q4oPyclQaa	It's very normal for young men to get frequent erections.  I know that my my boyfriend is pretty much erect anytime we're together. It took about a year before I could even see his penis flaccid... like I had literally never seen it flaccid because anytime I'm close enough to see it, it's always hard.    Anyway, what you should focus on is the idea that, just because you have an erection, doesn't mean you need to do something with it.  It's fine to have boners randomly all day long.  They won't hurt you.  And it's fine to feel horny.  And it's fine to masturbate.  But just because you have an erection, you don't need to masturbate.  And just because you're horny you don't need to masturbate either.  You should just masturbate when you have some private time and feel like masturbating.  Don't try to use it to fix your sex drive.  Your sex drive is fine!    I'd try to keep masturbation time down to once a day just so your penis doesn't start chafing and getting irritated.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You are completely normal.

I had to use three different types before I found a pill that didn't effect me or my body negatively.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Pharmaceutical companies wanting to make loads and loads of money. So they make these pills and put them on the market and tell you that they are good for you or that they will do some great thing for you so you will buy them. Differences could be what they used to make them.
9pLdhuBnaa	I had to do some research on this because it is not a name I recognize, but I found that it is the generic of one called Diane 35 which includes a medication that is designed to help control testosterone levels in women that have higher testosterone levels.    Higher testosterone levels in women (yes, women make a little bit of testosterone) can be an indication of a hormone imbalance such as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.    The other medication in this pill helps to lower these testosterone levels in women with the hormone imbalance.    I am also going to include the link to a site that may help you find more information.  The link is at: http://forums.obgyn.net/womens-health

RXI8ImdIaa	Frightened? Ok...    Cold medicines frequently contain pseudoephedrine and diphenhydramine.     the first of those is a stimulant, and the second one makes you sleepy. Either one of them, or the combination of the two, may be affecting you in such a way as to make you nervous.    My first guess is that it's the pseudoephedrine, but I don't know. You might want to just avoid taking cold medicine if it affects you like this.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	not abit just get to the doctor and find out.|`|j4uL3Ii6aa	nuthin 2 do with medicine 4 sure lol...|`|iN6iidUwaa	You could be experiencing an adverse reaction to the cold medicine.

553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	It all depends on the person, I think. Before I went to the dermatologist, it seemed like any pizza type foods would irritate my acne but that could have just been my imagination. If you have too much trouble with acne, go to the dermatologist before your skin gets really scarred. I'm pasting what I have answered to several others regarding acne. Hope this helps!!    Go to the dermatologist!!!! I had been using Proactiv for the past 3-4 years, thinking it was helping my face... HAHAHA!! I went to the dermatologist and the nurse practitioner put me on acne topicals (Differin and Duac- they're prescription only) and they told me to wash my face with CeraVe Cleanser and apply CeraVe lotion. I love that cleanser!!! It keeps my face from drying out. You can get it at most pharmacies and Walmart. You may have to ask for it behind the counter at some places. After I did a course of acne topicals and my face still wasn't getting much better, the nurse practitioner sent me to the dermatologist to be put on Accutane. Accutane is just a pill that you take for a couple months straight and it gets rid of your acne. It is a very annoying medicine though. It completely dries out all of your skin so I have to constantly apply moisturizer. Also, it has really nasty side effects such as depression and birth defects. You have to visit the dermatologist every month, and if you're a girl you need to be on birth control and get pregnancy tests every month. Its highly regulated, but it's definitely worth going through all the trouble if it clears up all your acne. Currently, I am almost done with my Accutane treatment before the dermatologist puts me back on topicals. My face is very clear. I hope that all this helped and you are not too confused. Oh... another topical I used in the beginning until insurance wouldn't cover was Tazorac. Good luck with your acne!!!! It really can get better, believe it or not!!|`|5Ra5xbziaa	no|`|9Avg7Oetaa	Defiantly not. There aren't foods that cause acne ..

9pLdhuBnaa	There are several possibilities for what could be causing this such as scar tissue build up (an example only but can sometimes occur for various reasons even if someone has never had surgery in the abdominal area).    The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.

rBzArT0xaa	Yea, just say that you really need to be able to see clearly, and that you can't see well in school. I had to wear glasses for 3 years before I got mine. You shouldn't have to pay for your own contacts.|`|kFHNIDYRaa	Do you have any hobbies where your glasses interfere? I have contacts because of my acting and movies. Always keep your bedroom clean, get good grades, eat right, make good choices, etc.  Good luck :)|`|sEZXNychaa	idk convince them tell them:  can i please just try the trial pair?? (im pretty sure there free)|`|2AIFQw1Qaa	Well, I'm 14 and I just got my contacts about three weeks ago. I had to wear glasses for about 2 years before my parents let me get contacts.  I'm not really sure which way would be cheapest, but it shouldn't be too bad if you have insurance.  To prove you're ready for contacts, the next time you go to the optometrist ask if you can try contacts. They should give a free trial pair and be asked to come in about 2 weeks after they give them to you to see how you're doing with them. Maybe that will help you prove to your parents that you're ready.  I'm not sure how you would make the money for contacts because it's at least like $150 for a year's set of contacts, depending on what kind of contacts you get (daily disposables, weekly, monthly etc.) and how much your insurance covers.
zddIYf9vaa	ha ha i know exactly what you mean    i use to have these strong contacts but for some reason they changed it to a really soft one, after a week one of them ripped in half. urrg    turns out that you have to be really careful, and if the lense is dry while you removing from your eye, it can also rip there    so just be careful|`|rBzArT0xaa	I also have acuvue oaysis, and you should take them off with care, and put only contact solution on them.

Corneal ulcerations occur more commonly in soft contact lens wearers, because the comfort level of soft contact lenses allow one to wear them for extended periods of time, thus increasing the potential for overnight use. Factors that contribute to infection included prolonged wear time, poor sanitation and cleaning habits (remember to clear your contact lens cases as well), and dry eye syndrome. Some people will often lubricate their contact lenses with their own saliva, on their tongue, if cleaning supplies are not immediately available, and this is certainly not recommended!
CDM8yvmCaa	Do you really want to screw up your life?     That is a pretty dumb thing to do.     When you are working as a professional, do you really want this to haunt you?     When you smoke weed, you just feel sleepy, hungry, a little bit sick... and many ppl continue. I think it's a waste of time and resources.    Leave these eggs and get on with your own life rather than choose the same path they've chosen. Just say, "nah, I can't be stuffed, I've got other things I want to do" then just hang out with a different crowd.    Go and work hard, make money, that's what smart people do.

You can't overdose on it, you can't get cancer, you can't die from it. So do it if you want, but let people try force you into it.

No one wants to smoke with them anyways.|`|J5jI6VDvaa	Hugs not drugs...

Wow...|`|mMxfVTSHaa	Joe-O answered this question with the following statement:    "Nevermind all of those idiots. Marijuana doesn't screw your life up. They obviously don't know what they're talking about. It doesn't do anything like make you go crazy, in fact it opens up your mind. You can't overdose on it, you can't get cancer, you can't die from it. So do it if you want, but let people try force you into it. I'll probably smoke weed one day not because somebody wants me to, in fact nobody has encouraged me to but I'd do it because I want to. And don't do it while you or anybody else is driving."      Marijuana doesn't screw your life up right?!  Marijuana OPENS YOUR MIND???!!!!    OK, let's see how it "OPENS YOUR MIND" my friends.    Look here:  http://www.drugabuse.gov/ResearchReports...    Think weed is the magic-mind opener now?    Marijuana addiction doesn't open your mind.  An increased risk of cancer doesn't open your mind.  Heart problems don't open your mind.    Don't do it!|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	I think you shouldn't let your dumb friend influence you.

WEED IS BAD!  R U SERIOUSLY ASKING THIS?!?!?!?!?!|`|8GwKUh65aa	alright brah, if you wanna go smoke dont go listen to these people because i smoke and its fun. you wont get that high your first time though. but dont listen to these other people saying just leave it in your mouth and blow it out they will know your not inhaling it. just inhale it cough a little and have some fun man dont listen to all these squares.|`|IaWlzcNsaa	If you have never smoked before, I'd suggest that you don't try it in a moving car.|`|G0y5Orooaa	It would sure be quite the experience, being your first time and all.. most people don't get high their first time, but if you smoke AND hotbox a vehicle, you will definitely get baked. It won't hurt you and you will only feel high for an hour to a couple.. depending. Expect the smell in your nose for a long time, and expect breathing in all the excess smoke...     If you feel uncomfortable about the whole situation, you don't have to go. There will be many more opportunities for you to toke.|`|tFcsLR7Maa	Alright if u go try not to inhale to much or get to high. Since its ur first time. You need to build tolerance. Some people can't handle a first high. It feels strong and intense. Try not to smoke to much.|`|vdT9VkZoaa	i have done it once also it was amazing make sure you take all the precautions though. If at all you feel uncomfortable say "Pass Bro i'm done." use a bong and do not exhale through your nose.|`|FytE2MH7aa	Well. It doesn't seem like a good idea. I wouldn't.   Do you actually even want to smoke pot in general?  If you do, just get high some other time.  I don't think that hotboxing the first time you get high would work out too well.... It might be really bad.|`|BWIrZJxgaa	go for it.  its the most relaxed u will ever be.  its noit what everyone says, you dont trip out or anything,  you just sit there and relax.  dont use a piece tho, theyre way harsh.  if u can, use a bong.  im not gona lie, i enjoy it.  but u dont have to smoke, u will get a little faded from second hand smoke.  try that and if u wana do it after that, then take a hit.|`|CWUHwhOpaa	Come on Dude weed is for freakin losers who have no personality and want to forget their worthless lives do the right thing DONT GO|`|UidQdNgXaa	simple:      NO! dont go .|`|QiWbcgWwaa	a say u shouldnt go but if u do dont inhale deeply so u dont get adicted puf out fast|`|VJQaZHmLaa	Im gonna say don't go because you will be caught out lying,you cant control your reaction to drugs especially your first time and it will be obvious to others that you haven't smoked weed before ,also like everything else you would always start on small amount im not encouraging you to smoke weed all im saying is that if you were going to you start will one cone or half a joint not go straight to a hot box you will get fried,and so messed up not only will you embarrass yourself you will also harm your health ,everyone makes mistakes but if your smart you will learn from other peoples mistake and not have to learn from your own after you have already suffered take it from me,don't smoke weed tell them you've realised that its pathetic and sad and that your not a loser with no life and you have given up smoking and just gonna stick to a casual drink.|`|40pyDwTGaa	Don't go!  Period end!    If your friends jump off a cliff would you go too?|`|ONEUGti0aa	(: first time i hotboxed it was accidental. i never smoked in my life and my homies knew that. we were goin to a party. contact high. lets just say that **** was doppeee. i didnt know i was high i jus knew i felt real good couldnt stop smiling and didnt know which way i wanted to walk lol! DOOO ITTTT.
akn0n65Gaa	hey hun just caaalm down. Im 14 but well educated. If its puss its not an ingrown hair most likely. sounds like just a pimple since it contains puss and bled. Talk to you doctor deffinately. He/she can give you something for it and make sure its nothing more. Take care luv, bless|`|NFG9zF4zaa	Don't worry it's probably just a pimple or sometimes if you dont get the ingrown hair out that happens|`|b9DhpqhUaa	Yeah hun Im sure its just a pimple or something. If you are that worried though then maybe you should see a Doctor just to be sure...it never hurts.
rUN9Dca2aa	A doctor is bound by doctor-patient confidentiality rules that would preclude them from discussing things of that nature with your parents.  There are some narrow exceptions, like if you are on drugs and you tell them that when you take drugs you want to kill yourself or another person, etc.  Then, they could disclose certain facts to protect life.|`|6JeLuAvcaa	i think it all depends really..      if its a lighter substance like cannabis they may not tell your parents if you don't want them too, and maybe they try to show you the risks themselves and make you give up or something..    harder stuff like cocaine or heroin they definitely would, but for your own good because the drugs are very dangerous, they could kill you and they are hard to kick so you would need all the help you can get.    hopefully i helped.    cheers|`|66tpufsgaa	probably, yah|`|AA10625089	Nope. Doctor/patient confidentiality. It's illegal for them to do so. However, it does no good for you to lie about it as they are trained to look for signs and symptoms of possible drug use. They will find out eventually.|`|Y8hzjcIFaa	my doctor never has....  they can lose there job for telling...|`|6XGYzWYbaa	no because of doctor patient confidentiality it would be illigal|`|Vv6FPagvaa	Under certain laws they can't and sometimes its because of their Hippocratic Oath. But No they can't its doctor patient confidentiality. They tell they can loose their jobs. It's up to the patient to tell and the doctor if told not to cannot. Unless its crucial in your diagnosis. If you don't tell your doctor they could misdiagnose a patient and it may lead to more difficult complications. NOT A GOOD THING. But if the patient does do drugs or something they have to tell the doctor. could be crucial. But to answer your question no. They do they get fired. Its really a huge thing on confidentiality so that really covers it.   Hope it Helps  Nathalie ?|`|mhLaOFZRaa	I think it would depend on your age and whatever the law is in your state/county.     If you don't do drugs you are very wise, so I do hope you are not considering doing them as that would be very unwise. Always think before you act because your decisions will affect your life and your future.    Just saw on t.v. today how the great Michael Phelps was photographed doing drugs. This has already lost him a contract with Kellogg's and probably will affect his life in many negative ways. He was such an example to young people and it is a shame that at his age he has made such an unwise decision.|`|kBwdaGY5aa	no doctors CANNOT tell your parents or the police if you are on drugs (except if your pregnant that could be an exception) ESPECIALLY if you tell them not to tell, if they do they can get in trouble|`|ipVGmNUCaa	its illegal so your set =)
UT5HS39Daa	You may just have a upper respiratory infection (aka. the common cold virus), that's what it sounds like by your symptoms. You can't really do anything for it except wait it out, and treat your symptoms as best you can. Try taking dayquil/nyquil for that, maybe some benadryl at night, over-the-counter cough syrup (any kind will work as long as it's for coughing and congestion), and acetaminophen if you have a fever.  The reason for the blood is probably because of you coughing too hard/very often.  It is pretty normal, but if it continues, go to the doctor. although it may be hard, try not to cough as hard and see if it clears up.  If if doesn't go away in about 3 or 4 days, see your doctor, they may can give you something stronger for your coughing.|`|7OZURudXaa	yeah go tell your doctor abot it. it might help,|`|MVvjHlqHaa	Yes, you do have more than a virus. It is a critical condition that can lead to many severe diagnoses that are fatal. If you don't want the condition to get really worse, go to the hospital asap.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Had it couple months ago. Bad. Went away. Should see doctor like I did.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	There is a virus going around like that so I dont think so.|`|IxD8aNHTaa	usuallu when you couch up blood in phlegm its from coughing too hard.|`|9Y9K7qDTaa	go to the doctorrrrrrrrrrrr.|`|KZWiRYEwaa	Mabey you have T.B?!?!|`|aD0SdVKdaa	call the doctor and say what is happening just to be safe...hope it isnt anything!!|`|6XGYzWYbaa	go to the doctor again and tell her that|`|NS84hq0gaa	idk|`|tKb7i5jtaa	that ain't good...|`|DKQ8BcO6aa	Yes. it could be T.B.......this is very unlikely but go back to the doctors immediately because it is better safe than sorry.      If you are able to diagnose yourself...WHY ASK?? fool|`|WvySsozyaa	It could be a sinus infection, and that is treated with antibiotics.    Feel better!|`|949AJbB6aa	It means you are coughing to hard...Or it could be tuberculosis. Go get cultures taken.|`|Vv6FPagvaa	Your coughing hard so its causing lungs to get all dry and your throat will start to get scratchy. The usual result is coughing up blood. But I would ask your doctor on the phone whats going on. But i really think that its just from coughing a whole lot. So what i would do is drink some tea with honey and lemon juice. Try gurgling some saltwater. 8 oz. with 1 tsp of salt stick the water in he microwave for 40 seconds and then add salt (btw 8 oz is one cup lol) Taste HORRIBLE but it does help a whole lot. I just did it last night and it relived me so much. Also you should try not talking. But talking your stressing your throat and then it's causing you to cough. Relive your talking. Your should be fine =D  Hope it Helps  Nathalie?

mRyG5Cvjaa	If he has hypertension or diabetes, it could be a problem. The heart is the key element to sex, especially for men.  The effects sex has on the heart is similar to warm-up exercises like jumping-jacks or a brisk walk. Upon arousal and during intercourse, blood pressure and heart rate progressively increases until the point of resolution or orgasm.  But if he's perfectly healthy, it could just be his age.  Younger men are more sensitive to erotic touch which is why it doesn't take much effort on a woman's part to arouse a young man. You could try female-superior position.  It's believe to be a position can help a man stay in the game longer. you can give him that tlc after he c*ms the first time for about 20 minutes.  I'm talking cuddling, kissing, and petting. You do that to him for a few minutes, he'll be back wanting more of you in no time. Check out the link by Dr. Sue Johanson below. She knows everything there is about sex.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	I've talked to overweight guys who have this problem. I think it may be the number one reason to stick with a diet.|`|uxq33y1maa	I don't think its you, and I don't think its his weight. It's something in his head. My bf is about that weight and he lasts 20-40 minutes. He needs to practice lasting longer on his own, and also learn to slow down or stop when he feels like he's close.|`|sRGPj46eaa	i dont think its the weight, unless he gasp lol or catching for air when his doing u|`|AA11614442	I am that same height and weight (loosing the weight bit by bit though) and we me and my GF have sex I last anywhere between 20-40 minutes.   I can concentrate really hard and knock one out in 5-10 if we are in a rush, but I prefer at least 20 minutes and lots of various fun positions.  10 min is about normal though...I would think.  My GF thinks I take too long sometimes.  The grass is always greener as they say

AA11619466	they always send it off for testing. how else would he know if it's malignant or benign? i've had 5 removed and all benign. the chances depend on lots of things like if your friend has skin cancer in the family, if she is in the sun a lot. a lot of moles are raised and that doesn't mean they're cancerous. the 'biopsy' is the act of removing the mole. they will send it away to be viewed closer and tested for abnormal growth. she should have results in about a week or 2. i hope she doesn't go to the tanning bed...|`|q3OLSnvqaa	Doctors send everything and anything removed from the body away to the lab to be analyzed.

xYTagSIyaa	Get a flashlight and look in your mouth and see if there is anything unusual.  Push your tongue down and swallow while you are looking.  Do you see anything blocking your ability to swallow?  Are there white patches on your throat or do your tonsils meet when you swallow, or can you not open your mouth properly?  If you cannot open your mouth properly you may have TMJ.  If there is white spots at the back of your throat, you could have a strep throat.  If your tonsils meet and block you from swallowing then it is your tonsils.  Do you have a fever?If you do you likely have an infection.  It is also possible if this is happening on and off it could be a life threatening allergic reaction called anaphalactic shock.

Once there, you can bring them to court and probably win if they threw you out. That is against the law (i think).

It may seem like nothing can get worse, but please dont kill yourself just do your best in all the opportunities you get and you will be fine. Q. why did your parents kick you out? If it is because of something you did, try to apologize to them and tell them you will never do such a thing again. Ask them for help and tell them that you will be a good kid and respect them more. And if they just kicked you out not be`cause of something you did then you need to find a shelter. Seek shelter at a relatives place, Talk to your school councilor, maybe a teacher that you really like, dont worry someone will get you help and everything will be okay. do not, i tell you do not end your life. You will achieve some great things some day. Just stay focused.! :)
m8dNXlMwaa	never used them, actually until I never even heard of either of those sites. Like I said before, buying online can be tricky. I have been buying from http://the-drug-store.com/ for a few years and they have always shipped  exactly what I ordered and their prices are really low.|`|b90766b79630675f736e3614463fff7aaa	Ive never heard of this website/pharmacy, but I do order my medications online from a different website.  I lost my health insurance a few months ago when I changed jobs, so it has been a major lifesaver for me.  I order my birth control from a website called BuyPrescriptionsOnline.net.  I went with this website because they are all operated within the US and have a doctor on staff that will review this online form you fill out and will give you a prescription.  The only shipping option is overnight shipping, so I usually get my prescription in a day or two.  According to their website, it is all legal and safe since they operate within the US and have to adhere to the same FDA regulations as any other local pharmacy (Rite Aid, Walgreens, etc).    Hope this helps!
PmYpNontaa	because there might be a life that is lighter and happier than the one you have now. You would miss that.  Also if you don't learn from the lessons of this life you take them to the next life (my belief)  Get some help, talk to someone on a help line.........lots of luck|`|r7x5M13Haa	you have to go to one extreme to go through the other    you have to see the bad side of the world to see how great the good side is..    any of this make sense...    you have to see the darkness to see the light-- if you dont THEN there is no point of living      its hard to explain|`|o3ECMDqXaa	b/c of whats in between life and death  i.e  friends  skool  family  and all the other things we need to learn b4 we can die!
pW3qOiRVaa	You probably have depression// bipolar disorder.    Bipolar disorder is a mental illness   People with bipolar disorder experience episodes of depression (lows) and  mania (highs)   Both men and women can get bipolar disorder   Depression is a low kind of mood. During an episode of depression, people feel sad or empty and lose interest in doing things that they usually enjoyed. Its also common to be slower in thinking and movements. A person may have less energy and need more sleep. They also may have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep2   Mania is a high mood. During a manic high, people feel unusually great. Its common to be overly talkative, have lots of energy, and need little sleep    If left untreated, bipolar disorder tends to worsen, and the person experiences episodes of full-fledged manic episodes and depressive episodes.         It is actually very likely that you may have bipolar disorder.   i hope you get better :(   remember, you are not alone. A LOT of people go thorugh this, just stay strong and get the right kinds of hepl and meds.|`|UIDfTmbcaa	quite possible. It is also possible that this is in addition to the initial diagnosis of depression, add & adhd. On top of everything else you are a teenager having to deal with hormonal changes. So you will have to go to hospital again huh. awwwww so sorry. Why whine about that. Sorry just pulling your chain. I would rather go to the hospital whether it is a hospital or a mental institution then go to my own funeral. I tried suicide a couple times. The first time completely blew me away. I went out into the woods to do it. I needed to make sure no one would find me for a long while. I am laying their bleeding out laying in a pool of my own blood and a homeless guy walks past me drinking a beer. Imagine that going otu to where you know you will not be found and God places a homeless man of all people in place to help me. He sees me and asks me what the bleep happened to you. I tried it again a couple years later where i needed an even longer stay in the hospital and the mental institution, The point is live for today. God is always here if only you realize he is. YOur life is constantly changing and it will get better.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	Bi Polar disorder is NOT about simple mood swings- up one minute then down the next.  No way.  It's being up/high/manic as hell for days/weeks  Then crashing into depression so severe you might kill yourself or someone else.|`|thzVWG1waa	okay chances are you are not bipolar, like NO ONE was called bi-polar a while ago, but ever since 2000 everyone blames everything on bipolar  is your medicine working right?|`|WNTzcc6saa	With bipolarity, you aren't depressed and then happy; you're depressed and then manic. Mania is characterized by excessive risk-taking, insomnia, hypersexuality, gambling, etc. Most people in a manic phase are not happy, any more than they are happy during a depressive episode. Perhaps your hormones are fluctuating, as is normal for a 16 year old girl. Have you tried watching your mood with your menstrual cycle? It's possible that you have PMDD, a very severe form of PMS.  TELL YOUR PSYCHIATRIST. That's what he's there for, right? You won't be hospitalized unless you actually attempt suicide, but if you catch it now and discuss it with your doctor, you might be able to get back on track without being hospitalized.|`|nc1whD2Daa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|XNkPciEoaa	It is a possibility that you are bipolar.  Sounds like you may need to try a different med if you are still having the ups & downs like that.  I would seriously consider talking with your doctor.  Being in a psych ward does suck, I know from experience, but getting the right medication is worth it.
36ea57b5e92e2cd26e3e52d63f4dc250aa	These describe my own symptoms (from time to time) very much. I was diagnosed 4 years ago with Active Crohn's after a single colonoscopy. Remicade infusions worked very well and put me into remission for almost 2 years. These symptoms have all started back up again and I am about to get back on the Remicade. You need to see a gastroenterologist.. they can likely put you on some meds which will decrease your symptoms to a manageable level. Prednisone works for short term pain relief. Asacol might help. I have taken Bentyl successfully for diarrhea. Nothing worked for me as well as Remicade in combination with drinking a daily smoothie made with Green Superfoods and Soymilk. The green food will help get some nutrients in you.. plus they are packed with probiotics which will help clear up any bacterial stuff going on in there and aid with the diarrhea.    Good luck to you!!!!|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Either Crohns, UC (ulcerative colitis), or IBS.     A fibre-optic colonoscopy very often yields a quick and precise diagnosis.     Don;t put it off.|`|wMx9Z2gTaa	It's time to see a specialist in diseases of the digestive system--a gastroenterologist. You might have irritable bowel disease, but you could also have some kind of inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's Disease. Whatever the cause of your digestive problems, more can be done to control the pain and the diarrhea.     If your doctor is not listening to you and you don't have access to a gastroenterologist, take yourself to the emergency room next time you have severe symptoms. It is not normal to have such extreme diarrhea and vomiting and could lead to dehydration and other serious health problems.    Good luck!
TLNQZ63baa	You have to kiss her neck while you are doing it. (Massage)
uqP94Tqraa	Your 13!!! You really should not have worry about that kind of stuff yet. Enjoy your young freedom while you still can. But, I do realize that kids are growing up faster and faster.    Let me ask you this, are you fair skinned or darker? It makes a huge diff. If you are fair to light skinned then this is what I recommend; Wax or trim with clippers. Do not and I repeat, do not shave. You will get nasty red bumps. You will have to deal with ithcy regrowth and you have to wait awhile before you can shave again. I am a fair skinned redhead, I used to shave and HATED IT!!! I decided to try wax out and I will never do anything other than wax again. Yes it will hurt the first couple times, but it is sooo worth it. It gets easier every time.   If you are medium to dark skinned, you have more options. Your skin is not as sensitive or at all. You can shave everyday with no irritation or wax or trim.  Up to you. I think everybody should wax. Unless you have super curly hair your more prone to ingrown hair.   Good luck! Just experiment and you will find what you like.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Don't shave. You'll get ingrown hairs and it will be prickly and itchy.     You could get a wax around the bikini line if you need it. I've been doing it since about your age and I'm 30 now and it barely grows back. I made the mistake of shaving once and I'll never do it again!|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	It's all up to you. If trimming works, keep doing what you're doing. I started off trimming when I was your age too, I moved on to shaving eventually and I preferred that more than trimming. I would suggest that you don't start shaving, it is not going to stay hairless for long and it will end up looking like you trimmed it anyway.|`|rXEVEfqHaa	I'm 16. I just keep it trimmed. I hate the feeling of it completly shaved. It itches like h-e-double hockey sticks. :)|`|60mDEusiaa	I've started trimming down there. I use to shave. I may wax during the summer, if I lose enough weight to wear my bathing suit.|`|7AnjBa5Baa	shave it  but shave downward  so it doesnt hurt  use venus|`|E8anv8Zzaa	I am speaking on behalf of 85% of all guys. Shaved is preferred among american guys. Now if you move to Australia that's a different story|`|s3WdcVknaa	dont shave because it gets prickly|`|1OA8ZegTaa	I wouldn't bother. In my opinion, there's hair down there for a reason. I just keep mine trimmed and neat. If you do decide to shave though, try to use a new blade and lots of shaving cream so you don't irritate the skin.|`|ipRPrvzxaa	the other guy who said shaving is preferred is a douche  Real men who you will end up dating in your lifetime won't care if they really love you.  He's probably never had a girlfriend before and watches "bad" videos to get over the loneliness.  Trim because shaving is itchy as h..l
Zo8RhY9Iaa	Exercise.and meditation!  Also stress balls are good|`|o6xLWwZvaa	There is always a reason a person has stress. You just said, you only have it when you are in school. So school is your stress. Maybe your classes, friends, teachers, overall studies, worried about not passing for the year etc..     To get rid of the stress you have to find the problem and take care of it.
b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|AA11333543	eat a super sweet fruit of your favorite instead.... thats what i do and i live in a house of sweet tooths...i usually go for pinapple/mango/or kiwi...|`|s9ZAiqJOaa	try to have a strict diet with fiber and grains with natural fruit juices and complex carbohydrates exercise everyday for an hour and maybe try yoga it may make you lose weight and be confident hoped i helped  also eat small portions every other hours to keep you from getting hungry , hungry means more eating and no fats fast food or try less fried foods|`|hbupUkHvaa	I would say the best thing to do is stop drinking soda and drink water my mom lost 20 pounds that way and if you walk around  it helps too. Also if you wish to lose weight tell someone to help you watch what you eat. Also if you eat everyone and a while try to remember not to go back for seconds.|`|dfyZf6cWaa	well if it concerns your health you should speak up, i did and it pays off greatly. Also more veggies if you can alot of water to feel less hungry and cravings go away, avoid high fructose corn syrup and anything 'Diet' or 'Lite' the regular stuff is way better. And if you can try to eat whole foods, it is not bad to have the things you like but try the organic kinds or things with weird ingredients especially monosodium glutamate aka msg food additive, ehh hope this helped =]|`|sBfOPQl4aa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the only diet that definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed 25 pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|t2zCaaQAaa	I feel the SAME way! If your father brings something home, that you have a crave for, just say no, and maybe save it for another day, or give it to another family member, it is ok to  treat yourself once in a while, maybe you could start a craving on something healthy! Maybe try unsalted popcorn, pretzels, or another snack food, that may seem like junk food, but it really is not. Tell your family your dieting, so the next time they do the grocery shopping, they will be sure to leave out some of the goodies. Love ice cream? Well there is always Low-fat ice-cream, or vanilla is the best ice cream for you! Most three day diets even say that after dinner you can have 1 Cup of low-fat vanilla bean ice cream! So even if you really want all those junk foods, you can still have them, just cut the portions! Or just don't buy them at all. =]|`|RKpP6i3baa	5 pounds is easy to loose! and also u have to control urself psychologically for example prevent urself from eating those ice creams and chocolates etc because they are always going to be there!

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Lay off the peroxide, it isn't helping matters.  You don't need to worry about keeping it cleaner than you can get with a regular shower.  The skin in the area will be slightly swollen.  You damaged skin that has to be repaired.  There's extra blood supply to the area to help do that, and the swelling tends to encourage you to keep your hands off it and take care not to bang it.  You don't even need to put Neosporin on it.  By now the outer skin is healed closed, and the repairs are all underneath where the ointment can't reach.  Peroxide kills healthy cells as well, and keeps the whole thing moist.  A dry cut heals faster than a wet one.   So just put on the bandage, and leave it be in  peace.|`|iwVUl4Jkaa	well, being the son of  nurse, i can tell you it is NOT normal and sounds like you have the beginnings of an infection. if it looks red, swollen, feels warm to the touch, puffy and hurts, get yourself back to the emergency room A.S.A.P. you should be on antibiotics RIGHT NOW!!!!!. don't waste your time with newsprint or hydrogen peroxide, those aren't going to do much good. if you wait to long, your running the risk of a serious blood infection and the end result could be gang green in your leg. btw, you MUST keep those stitches CLEAN and DRY. do NOT let them get wet.
WuskPQ6Qaa	Everyone goes through what your going through just some such as yourself can't handle it & some such as myself can
ayx9WFYYaa	For someone who wants to be healthy, you are eating the wrong foods!  What's with all these granola bars?  Have cereal and fruit for breakfast, fruit for a snack.  You need to have a good lunch... a sandwich, salad and/or soup...veggies or fruit, cheese and crackers for a snack, and a real supper.  You are young and active and you need to feed your body!  I suggest that you see a nutritionist or tell your parents what's going on with you.  Please don't make yourself starve to death.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	You eat a lot of sugar at night because your body is starving for nutrients. Drink lots of water and eat lots of fruit/veggies. Eat a healthy balanced diet and you wont binge on sugar like that. BTW, don't eat so much sugar!    No, you don't have an eating disorder. Eating disorders aren't really about eating, they're psychological.
7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Get off empty calorie junk food & sugary sweet soda's.  Start eating a good, healthy, balanced diet.  Drink plenty of water & milk  Snack on lots of raw fruits & vegetables.  Fix yourself a milkshake every day & add (1) raw egg into the blender.  You cannot see nor taste the egg once it is blended.  It will add extra protein.  Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  If you can't gain weight with fat - you can gain weight in muscle.  You should start filling out as puberty progresses also.|`|oTHGgowsaa	It's not simple, you have to know what to eat, how much, and how often. Also, if you don't want your extra weight to turn into fat, you need to work out either to build muscle or just to burn off calories. Eat lots of calories, eat about six 500 calorie meals per day, more carbs and protein than fat. Protein and carbs both contain 4 calories per gram, while fat contains 9 calories per gram. Just get more calories than your body needs, I love bodybuilding, and there's a free program online at www.fitday.com which lets you keep track of how many calories your getting, what kind, and how much your burning and how your burning them. If you want to build muscle you should be getting 0.88 to 2 grams of protein per pound you weigh DAILY. And be sure to work these proteins into repairing and therefore building muscle tissue so it doesn't go to fat. Unsaturated fats like olive oil etc. are good for getting some quick calories, but try to eat lots of animal byproducts. Also, if your having trouble getting that many grams of protein per day, you might want to consider a suppliment. There are all natural ones like 100% whey protein, and that way you can get the protein you need.

LdU9Hx4Aaa	Its great that you have good abdominal strength but if you want visible abs, crunches are not the way to go. That 'flab of skin' is actually extra body fat you have stored around your midsection. As the abdominal muscles are virtually the last to atrophy, you can leave the ab exercises alone for a few months and instead, put your time into cardio and weight training.    I assume that you understand fat loss results from a caloric deficiency in the body. This means that in order to lose fat you must use more calories than you intake (eat). Measure how many calories you eat at the moment and subtract 250 from this number. In addition to this, begin cardio training 3-4 times a week combined with weight training 2-3 times per week. This lifestyle will reward you with fast results.    The reason you shouldnt take more than 250 calories off your diet is that you will need these calories to repair your body after cardio and weight training. Consuming too little calories also lowers your metabolism, burning fat slower than it should be.    You are at the point where you are not overweight, but are trying to lose the last 10 pounds, the 'vanity pounds'. The body likes to keep hold of this extra fat in case of emergency (such as starvation, etc.). This is why it is so difficult to lose this weight. You must FORCE your body to let go of this fat through a combination of good diet and intense training. Try this for one month and if you push youself to the limit I can gaurantee that you will see some decent results.

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	There will be a little red bump which will probably produce a white head on it.  Or, you could have an ingrown eyelash which will do about the same thing.    My great grandma told me that the way to get rid of styes was to walk to the corner carrying an old dishrag, find a bit rock and put the dishrag under it and then turn around and say "stye stye on my eye, get on the next one that passes by."  That works, I must say.|`|AkkZ6WKuaa	A stye usually is bump on your eye, almost similar to a pimple. Is your eye just red or does it have that bump. It may be an eye infection such as pink eye.
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	You could have a sinus headache or inflammation, or simply a cold coming on.  You can get these headaches when the weather changes, especially in the winter when the heaters are on since they dry out the air so much.  Try drinking more water, and try to add more water to the air by boiling a pot of water on the stove, or run the shower, or wet some hand towels and hang them up to dry letting the water evaporate into the air.  Pain relievers may help but if they don't then try sinus medication.  The vertigo is because your sinuses are 'packed', and I find that taking a hot shower and putting my head under the water can help quite a bit.|`|AA10953999	Could be a pinched nerve or maybe you are sleeping wrong.

t9IrZHqJaa	First off, you do not have to worry about this at all at your age if you're eating right and not binging on fast food everyday. You should only be worried if you know for sure that you're are genetically predisposed.    Your body should produce enough HDL to fight cholesterol.     If you want to know how you maintain and lower cholesterol, you would need to decrease your intake in red meat, yolk in eggs, and limit yourself with fast food such as burgers. Increase in fiber, fruits, and good home cooked meals. Another thing you can do is exercise regularly.     This is the best way to maintain a good cholesterol level and prevent you from getting high cholesterol.|`|MI0MIAfaaa	Eating less animal products helps.  Less meat, fish, butter, milk, eggs, cheese, etc.  Particularly high in cholesterol are fast foods.  Generally, eating more veggies is better.    Staying a healthy weight and getting enough exercise also helps lower cholesterol.    The cholesterol we eat comes from animal sourced foods (meats, dairy, eggs), but sometimes our bodies produce too much on their own so it's possible to have high cholesterol despite a low cholesterol diet.  They check your cholesterol when you get a blood test at the doctor's and will tell you if it is ever too high.
VNvVhDWgaa	Get a cotton swab dipped in alcohol and rub it on both the front and the back of the hole. Then rub the earring down with alcohol and put it back in. The hole is not old enough to hold it's own yet. You can also use peroxide before using alcohol on the hole, to make sure there's no infection, and that right now it's just irritated.    Usually the alcohol/peroxide cleanings 2-3x a day does the trick within a week. If, however, it starts getting worse after a couple of days, replace your stud with one made from Silver, Titanium, 18K + gold, or surgical steel. You may have a metal allergy.

There's no way you can perfectly get rid of it in 1 day.|`|eA5OSxiwaa	Okay this is what i do. Put some toothpaste on it(the kind that is just plain...no gel or anything else in it)    And leave it on overnite(sleep on it).    And the redness will be gone, it will be less swollen, and less noticeable. But im sorry it will still kinda be there. Nothing is ganna make it go away overnite.    See what the tooth paste does is that toothpaste has just the right amount of alchol in it, which dries the pimple up and redces redness.    Hope this helps!!!

You can also always put a really hot cloth on top of it, and keep it on for a couple minutes (as long as you can handle/ maximum 2 min) then put some non-whitening toothpaste on top of it. Keep it on for about two hours then wash off. This will get rid of the redness.

If you stop smoking right now.............    In 20 minutes your blood pressure will drop back down to normal.   In 8 hours the carbon monoxide (a toxic gas) levels in your blood stream will drop by half, and oxygen levels will return to normal.   In 48 hours your chance of having a heart attack will have decreased. All nicotine will have left your body. Your sense of taste and smell will return to a normal level.   In 72 hours your bronchial tubes will relax, and your energy levels will increase.   In 2 weeks your circulation will increase, and it will continue to improve for the next 10 weeks.   In three to nine months coughs, wheezing and breathing problems will dissipate as your lung capacity improves by 10%.   In 1 year your risk of having a heart attack will have dropped by half.   In 5 years your risk of having a stroke returns to that of a non-smoker.   In 10 years your risk of lung cancer will have returned to that of a non-smoker.   In 15 years your risk of heart attack will have returned to that of a non-smoker.   http://www.healthbolt.net/2006/07/19/wha...    The above is for cigarettes, but it seems the effect is similar for both..........
8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.    Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Yes, they can. And I bet the only reason that you are half an inch apart depending on the time of the day is that you hunch more at different times. I can't think of another reason that makes sense. I mean, you really don't grow a half inch then shrink an inch in one day.  I don't believe the "You can't grow 2 years after your period thing"...I've never heard of it, and I had my period when I was 13 going on 14, and my doctor said I would probably grow until I was 16. I've heard that most girls quit growing taller around that age, though.    Edit: Brianna, it was a back doctor that I had visited for scoliosis, too! Lol. But he didn't tell me that, as far as I can remember.|`|Z8FShKTmaa	you stop growing about 2 years after you get your period. I used to have scoliosis and my back doctor told me that.|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	Don't panic...women don't stop growing until about 18-20 years of age.

nEVoabeSaa	I will assume in the past you had a accident with the knee? Me, I got mine caught between two cars and it was stuck so I kept pulling it, rather then walk back out of the situation and hence serious bruise and joint effusion. The effusion just means that the fluid that usually stays inside the synovial sack and keeps the joint lubricated has leaked out into the surrounding tissue. Bruise well you know what that is. Give it time and I mean time and the knee will recover. Best of Luck|`|jfmQx9Tbaa	For lack of better words you have an abnormal amount of joint or synovial fluid surrounding your joints.

kxyR9e57aa	That depends on your prescription insurance coverage.  But the best cash price I know of is at Costco, where the listed price is $7.11 for 100 tablets of 500 mg, or $13.77 for 100 tablets of 1000 mg.  If you buy 200 tablets at once, the second hundred tablets is less than the first hundred, so that 200 tablets of metformin 500 mg will be less than $14.22, and so on.  In my state (California), the pharmacy at Costco must be open to the general public, although they may charge a slightly higher price to non-members.  I don't know if other states require the pharmacy to be open to the general public.  Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and Target all advertise $4 per month co-pays on many generic medicines, so that may be an alternative for you.  One further way to save some money, if you're really tight financially and you take the 500 mg strength, is to use a pill cutter to cut 1000 mg tablets in half.  But if you're on the 1000 mg tablets, this won't help..|`|iK3YYRaTaa	I moved to Thailand . I get 500 mg. tablets for 2 cents a piece. Come vacation here an take a load of Metformin Home with you.

Doing a simple search on the best buy site will probably tell give you some info on that too.  Or you can always ask a worker in the store.

d6M0jmIkaa	When I was young I used to get panic attacks almost every night.  I would also shake uncontrollably.  They are terrifying but completely harmless.  It feels like your going to die but you're fine.  Mine were always at night too, but I don't know why.    A good technique I learned is to take an object and describe it out loud as if to a blind person, in as much detail as possible.  It really worked for me and I haven't had a panic attack in years.  Tell your sister to try this, it might work for her as well.  I added a link to a good sight, do some research. Knowledge is power.|`|F8tQkDPcaa	There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.  They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.

Your sister just needs to tell herself that it's just a panic attack - that she isn't going crazy or dying and that it will pass soon. It's very hard to overcome but I'm sure she can do it. I began taking prozac for my panic attacks... I used to get them daily, and now it's a rare occurrence when I have one.. I was sketchy by medication at first too.. but seriously, it really helps.|`|QXlvr4zBaa	I have the same problems with anxiety. I can't sleep at night and im just so high strung all the time.

Sorry im not much help.. just no caffeine.|`|VV6rMXcraa	I suffer from severe Panic Disorder, so I can sympathize with your sister a great deal. The answer though, is NO. Please don't worry, because nothing can or will really happen, aside from perhaps hyperventilating during the attack. I would suggest having her breathe into a brown paper bag, because doing so will allow her to replace the carbon dioxide that she's lost while hyperventilating, and help avoid dizziness, etc. It's great that she's learning ways to control her panic attacks, and I think getting on some sort of anxiety medication would be a good idea if she hasn't already. Best of luck to you and her both! (:
nkTKIXcBaa	I'm no expert, but here's what I can think of:  1. They might not be related - my little sister gets nose bleeds a lot during winter, just because it's so dry.  2. Check the side effects of whatever medicine your child is taking to treat the fever - maybe that's the cause?  3. Sometimes viruses can cause both fevers and nosebleeds, so this might be the onset of the flu or cold or something.  4. Sinus infections can cause nosebleeds and fevers. I don't really know much about sinus infections. But I'm thinking it's worth looking up.    I wouldn't panic about it or anything... nose bleeds and fevers are both so common (esp. in children) that there's very little chance that it's something serious. Unless the kid starts having trouble breathing, acting really really lethargic/otherwise out of character, or outright asks you to take him/her to a doctor, I'd just wait it out.     Hope this helps!    edit:// OOH one more thing! This is kinda random, but my chemistry teacher has recently been warning us to stay away from Advil; apparently, it can cause a fatal disease in children and teens and ibuprofen is a wayyy better choice.|`|2dfd3c8c6b41e357078ce270679d8fcfaa	the common cold - dry weather, etc. can lead to nose bleeding.

lAZWTLtRaa	Um I've heard its common for pregnant women to get yeast infections.  Just suck it up until you can go to the doctor. Have you read the symptoms for yeast infections? It's been a while since I have but I don't think odor is one of them (this could be caused by another infection).  If you have to keep changing your underwear, buy some of those pads made for the end of your period or for light flow, just to avoid the mess in your underwear and since they're smaller, they're more comfortable and hardly noticeable.    If the symptoms go beyond a yeast infection (and since you are pregnant) you really need to go to a doctor.  Um I'm not sure how the whole insurance thing works for you, do you live in the US?  You don't have to pay to talk to a pharmacist do you?  If you don't ask them what it could be and what medication they recommend, since you're pregnant.|`|zNhUBErCaa	It depends on the oder. If its a fishy oder, you most likely have a bacterial infection. Trust me. I have one right now. I've had mine for a year and a half.. *sigh*  Instead of changing your underwear twice a day, buy some pads. They work wonders. Oh, and I would recomend you going to a Womans Health Care doc. They base on womans health, so they no about everything :] Once you get insurance go.     If its more like a yeasty oder, then well... You have yeast infection.     I think you can try buying a screening kit at a rite aid, or something. But im not sure if you can use it when your pregnant. so call before you use it [if you do] I dont want anything to happen. But the screening kit will give you I think about 4 different infections you might have...     Cangrats on you having another kid. Hope everything works out well~|`|1nk8WPrtaa	It sounds like you have the hee bee gee bee's        It's crazy, crazy, crazy. Trust me!    I'm sorry, I thought you were joking. So sorry!|`|MhpccWpmaa	What's the consistency of the discharge?  And how would you describe the smell?  Bacterial Vaginosis involves A LOT of watery discharge that has a very strong fishy-like odor.  Yeast Infections usually don't smell but they are associated with a lot of discharge that is clumpy and a cottage-cheese like texture.  If your symptoms sound like a yeast infection then I would reccommend buying some monistat if you can't go to the doctor.  However, if your symptoms sound more like the bacterial infection, you'll have to go to a doctor or some kind of free women's clinic.  This can't be cured by any over the counter means, you'll need a prescription for Flagyl.  If this is what you have you need to get it cured ASAP because if left untreated you run the risk of developing PIV (pelvic inflammatory disease) and plus, I've had this three times before and the discharge and smell make you feel really insecure and self conscious|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Different types of infections:    Signs of yeast infections:  White, cottage cheese-like discharge  Swelling and pain around the vulva  Intense itching    Signs of bacterial vaginosis:  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge  A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap  Itching or burning  Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva     The vagina is self-cleaning. The amount of discharge could be your body working really hard to get rid of the infection and keep it away from the baby.

Masturbate as usual, but just before you ejaculate, stop for a minute or so, then start again. Keep stopping, and resting, as many times as you can.  You will find that with practise, you will be able to control yourself better, and this will help when you get to have sex.

dtzlrB9Faa	Yes, all three of you go and get tested and specifically ASK for the test for herpes as it's not given in a routine std screen.  It is possible one of them had it and didn't even know they did. If both of them test positive then you really wouldn't know for sure-maybe one would have antibodies that showed it was a new infection.|`|1f644ebbaa	Yes, confront them and ask.

Good luck.|`|JyEoCBrJaa	When did you start having symptoms? Have your other partners had a very active sexual life before you? Do your other partners have symptoms or talked with you about symptoms in the past. This is a very touchie subject. This is how I would approach it. Tell each of your partners(on certain days) that you go every six months to get tested for an STD and that you'd rather be safe then sorry. Ask them would they come and get tested, if they loved you then they should have no problem in doing this. I'm assuming you are not sexually active. Just say you will not have sex again until he/she goes to the clinic with you. End of discussion, b/c more than likely they may not know they have it.|`|2dfd3c8c6b41e357078ce270679d8fcfaa	Yes - you can ask.

They will NEVER go away - but you can decrease the break-out SIGNIFICANTLY if you are treated.|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	not really..even if you ask they're gonna lie..i wouldnt go ask anyway because if you ask the person that didnt give you the herpes they are probably going to tell other people you have it..
2b076701991fe0ec4cefa9fc66914174aa	Most children with Kawasaki disease get better and have no long-term effects, even if they do not receive treatment. However, treatment shortens the illness and greatly reduces the chances of having problems from Kawasaki disease.    About 20% of children who are not treated will have problems in the arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary artery disease). Weakened coronary arteries may get enlarged or can narrow or develop blood clots. In very rare cases, this can lead to a heart attack.    The risk of heart attack is greatest within 1 year after the illness. However, studies in Japan indicate that children who develop coronary artery damage are more prone to having a heart attack as young adults|`|kj507W26aa	I really doubt that you'll suffer any of the symptoms again This is merely a child's disease and the complications for it would have happened back when you were a small child and not today.|`|gzaXHcweaa	most kids recover w/o serious problems

Excercise - take a walk each day for more than 45 minutes 3 times a week.  Healthy Diet - Cut out junk food and avoid eating from out. Make your own meals. Eat less fat and oils and try to avoid too many sweets. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Make healthy food choices.  And most importantly be consistant with the above two points mentioned.

RXI8ImdIaa	Put a moisturizer on it, and try to avoid touching it.    If it's really extremely chapped, you might want to put vaseline on it. I'd save that for extreme cases though because it could give you pimples.|`|HwDEBqwKaa	Same thing happened to me last night.  My advice:  - take a steamy shower, it will make you feel better  - afterwards, if you have moisturizing face lotion, put a few dabs on your nose where it's chapped.  It might sting, but if you sleep with it on your nose overnight, you will wake up virtually brand new.  I used hand lotion for dry skin and that worked.      and I'm better today because of this :)

Check Yahoo groups, I'm in a great one for Bipolar. There are live support groups too, do a google search for some in your area. Actual free counseling is harder to find. Sometimes you can find a counselor who will see you for a reduced price or there may be a clinic that offers free care if you meet financial guidelines. I wouldn't trust anyone offering free counseling on the net.... they really may not know what they are doing.|`|kfg1Sw72aa	Look, right now you think the best thing you need is counseling from sites, what you really need is someone to talk to about your depression that you're having. The best people you could talk to would be trusted friends, or family. Find who you really trust most and express your feelings to them. Who knows, they might be able to help more then people you don't actually know.

Harriet|`|AA10350894	I don't think anyone would be mad at you for choosing circumcision if that is what you wanted or needed. At least you were allowed to decide, for many that is the main complaint about circumcision, it being forced upon a guy as a baby without ever knowing if that is what he would have wanted.  As for your incision reopening, you should get to the doctor right away before the skin there heals in the state it is in leaving you with this "gap" permanently.    To all the people who are giving this guy the business about being cut, why bother? It is a done deal! Giving him a hard time about it isn't going to make his foreskin suddenly reappear! Besides from what he said it sounds as if it was his choice, at least he was able to decide unlike a lot of other guys! So let's just give him the best advice we can that will help him deal with the problem at hand!    For the record, I am neither for or against circumcision, I am however against it being forced upon some one with out their consent or knowledge.|`|K4zsztkRaa	You need to go back to the doctor, you could get it infected and that wouldn't be good, well unless you want your whole penis amputated too.

Aww gawd, waking up and seeing them is creepy. And the bit afterwards were you pee blood for 5 seconds. Makes me cringe still. Sorry. With regards to your question, I had sex asap after the operation and one of my stitches came out. There is a gap all of the way round between the head and the other bit :S but my girlfriend never minded.

6ay30isVaa	Sex addiction, like all addictions has two key components, obsession and compulsion.  One obsesses over sex and sexual situations to the point that they compulsively act it out.  Once acted out, they continue to obsess and act out.  A never ending loop.  It is not just enough to tell someone to stop thinking about it.  The mind has it's own agenda and if sexual thoughts raise the levels of mood altering chemicals in the brain, then the brain will want more and more of it, creating and tempting you into the obsession.  There are 12 step groups that deal with sexual and compulsive addictions.  They can give you the tools necessary to deal with the compulsive and obsessive aspects.  They can also give you a place to feel free to be who you are as well as an opportunity to help others.  SAA and SLA are two that come to mind.  Hang in there.  Like all addictions this too can take everything from you, by leading you into unhealthy and dangerous relationships where disease and drug use are prominent.  Contact a local 12 step group and talk to someone.  They know what you are going through and will walk you through the steps.  A good book is, "Out of the Shadows" by Patrick Carnes.      Good luck.|`|AA10358331	See a councilor|`|kfg1Sw72aa	What you need to do is stop having so much time to think about all these sexual thought's.

Any drug that alters your state of mind can cause paranoia, anxiety and even brain damage. Ecstasy forces the brain to release serotonin (it's a chemical that helps regulate important brain functions), which causes a depletion in the amount of brain serotonin that you need to properly function. That's when you become depressed, anxious and paranoid.|`|RaqmXLbhaa	yes definately...it is more common if the person is a nervous person or initially worried someone will find out.

You're lucky that you only have those scars and not the more invasive ice pick ones, those are much harder to eliminate.    Good luck.

Riding your bike and cutting out sodas is great.  Another tip is to try to eat five fruits and vegetables everyday (by replacing junk snacks) and they will help you feel full longer.  Try to incorporate more activities in - go play frisbee, dance around your room, play fetch with the dog.  Keep up the the good work!  Good luck!|`|nPt7hUE8aa	You will not see a change in only a week. You just need to stick to it. Ab exercises don't generally work well, you will start losing fat from places where your body is storing. Riding your bike is good. You might want to take a longer route home from school because eventually your body gets used to the routine and wont burn fat. You need to alter your routine every couple of weeks.

OUXO6g6Laa	Each will inhibit the metabolism of the other.  If you skip some Abilify doses before and after loading up on DXM then it shouldn't be much of an issue.  If you experience any side effects from the Abilify, you should compare them to the effects of DXM.  There may be some other interactions, but they don't appear to be too serious.    For what it's worth, a few people have reported taking DXM and Abilify together.

I am curious as to what drives you to this place, and I humbly put forth the philosophy that choice is the only real freedom we have.|`|noCVbwY3aa	The REAL concern with drug interaction is, as I'm sure you've read, between SSRIs or even worse, MAOIs.  I have experienced the fabled serotonin syndrome, and believe me it's not as fun as it sounds.  In all of my reading I have never come across anything related to antipsychotics interacting negatively with DXM.  As one recommended, maybe skip a couple of doses beforehand, as you will find much about the metabolization of DXM and how many many many things effect it (grapefruit juice, for instance).      Start small, is my last piece of advice.  Find what YOU like...I have read many people saying that 3rd plateau is the only one worth it, and since I have exclusively tripped 2nd my entire time, I was thinking I was ready to try the 3rd.  You will come to find that they call them plateaus for a good reason.  Each one seems to take the form of a different drug altogether.  I like being extra loopy and social with non-drug users, and 2nd is GREAT for that.  At 3rd, you are so withdrawn into yourself, you speak in almost incomprehensible fragments.  I kept having the habit of whispering everything I said, which got a lot of weird looks of concern.      Depending on your weight, I would recommend between 200 - 300 mgs for your first, and increase by no more than 100 for each consecutive trip after that.  You may take a while to get to your comfort zone, but it won't be such a shock, and you'll experience every transient phase individually.  Be safe, and walk away when the time is right.  You will know when.

2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	It sounds like mononucleosis or another virus.  Some viruses can attack the system for extended periods, like mono and can cause long-term effects.  I would think the doctors would have found evidence of mono but one can not be sure anymore.  Often the tests they run are for specific common viruses, but you may have one that was not part of what they were looking for.  You say you have been to several doctors, and I can't help but wonder if they duplicated the tests they each gave you, or that they took additional tests beyond the first ones taken.  I certainly hope they tested further, as it is possible that each doctor did the same test and didn't look any further than the original tests.     I would treat it as a virus and keep taking aspirin or tylenol, drink lots of fluids (note, you could easily get dehydrated in winter and that can contribute to the problem), take warm showers to help with back pain, eat well,  and get as much sleep as you can.  Vitamin C has anti-viral qualities, so make sure you are getting some. If you have not had improvement in a week, you need to contact one of the doctors and ask for referral to a specialist - or get additional tests.  Best of luck, hope you are feeling better soon.    http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...|`|9yj86j0Caa	I don't know, but i seem to be suffering from similar symptoms.

One of them because her brother, my cousin had died, so she commited suicide while she was high. I was in the house for one of them and knew that he was doing drugs, but I didn't stop him and now I regret it like hell.PLEASE, GO GET HELP. It doesn't make you a bad person owning up to your addiction it makes you an even BETTER person for realizing your mistake. I'm sorry I just had to tell you that.|`|LSVIZoz4aa	Are you sure the green you've been smoking hasn't been tweaked a little?

bQ4RAi07aa	Though muscle aches and pains are common, they are never any fun. Especially if every move you make is painful. A good way to avoid trauma to the muscles is by remembering to stretch them gently before activity. Your local gym, or health practioner can point you in the right direction if you're not sure what stretches would be most beneficial. Stretching is especially valuable during the winter months when mucle fibers are contracted to conserve body heat. When experiencing muscle pain caused by injury or overuse, rest the region affected until the inflammation subsides. During the first 24 hours, an application of ice is advised to alleviate swelling. Never apply ice to bare skin, but use protective covering, or an ice pack. After the initial rest period, many people find a heating pad or water bottle soothing, or an alternation of hot and cold. Massage can bring relief, and after a rest period, gentle stretching can also help the muscles regain their elasticity and health. Homeopathy can be of great benefit before, during and after sports, especially if bruising, swelling, spasms or pain are present. In some cases, muscle pain can be an indicator of a more serious health problem. It's alway wise to check with your health practitioner is the pain is severe or chronic
gC7CjJOsaa	probably not likely that you'll have serious problems. not at all. you may have some spotting and irregular bleeding. when i switched birth control i had no side effects at all. my doctor told me that the most that can happen is just some hormonal changes, maybe mood changes, or irregular bleeding at first. that's just because of the different hormone levels that are in birth control pills. but i'd say it's nothing to worry about :)
UoAZzwacaa	You'll generally get your period about a year after you grow pubic hair.     Look for changes in your discharge, such as clear, stringy discharge (this signals that you're ovulating and is to help sperm reach your egg). It varies from woman to woman but menstruation normally starts 5-7 days after your discharge changes. Other common signs are sudden bad acne breakouts, breast tenderness, etc. Every woman is different and once you get your period you will learn your own personal signals that you are about to start.|`|iOOw74DXaa	theres no way too know, fr about a year before i got mine i would get bad cramps about every month. youll know when you get it and dont worry because the first time usually isnt very heavy. but you probably should be getting it soon|`|QWylMGLGaa	Wait. And celebrate.|`|phCae73Kaa	trust me you will know...  just wait... thats all i can say|`|9xxCZBq2aa	trust me. you don't want your period. lol! most of the time it starts with spotting in ur underwear. spotting as in little spots of blood.|`|QfkeanBQaa	most of the girls  before they get their period like they get this whitish gooey liquid.  sometimes for 2 years the max.|`|FCfQ8jVHaa	well when you look in your underwear and there's kind of a dark brown, red-ish color. and it'll stink (litterally) .      good luck!!!|`|gC7CjJOsaa	you won't know when you're going to get it....it will just come :) just a little spot in your undies. nothing scary. i had all the things you have for a little while before i got mine.
W3bcdCymaa	Of couse they will grow more you are only 13. My mom didn't develope her big breasts until she was in her 30's. I am not sure about the itching thing, but I know when my belly was growing while I was prego it itched a lot, so you never know!    P.s. after you have a kid they will most likley be a size bigger, mine were! lol|`|iOOw74DXaa	my boobs went on a major growth spurt after i started getting my period.|`|VV6rMXcraa	You are still so young, and there is a great chance that they will get larger as you grow. Women's bodies don't stop growing/maturing until they are 18, so you've still got a long way to go! I'm sure soon enough you will get through a growth spurt and wish they'd have stayed small! ;D Don't worry, hunny.|`|VbaLXvuMaa	Yea my boobs itch, but dont scratch because youll get stretchmarks on your boobs and it looks nasty.....you still have a long way for them to grow, have patience.....=]|`|rv9nDch2aa	I know how you feel.

You may be a little under weight but that's just how your body is. If you are eating balanced meals, drinking a lot of water, and getting moderate excercise, you are fine.

If you eat, I think you're fine, as long as you don't feel faint or anything.|`|eAxwC5nlaa	You have a high metabolism and you are under weight.

7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	Yes, you probably should, I think it lasts for 5 years.  Was it the serious kind of pneumonia you had before?  Or was it like walking pneumonia.

AA11506348	I am not an expert, but I know that seizures are caused by the brain's activity becoming too normalized.  It may be possible that you interfered with your brain's activity.  One time, when I hit the back of my head on something, I saw nothing but white briefly.  As for not being able to move one side of your face, you probably struck a nerve.  You will probably not experience more facial numbness...unless you repeat the injury.  As for being worried...if you find yourself on the floor again, or have other unusual sensations call a friend and as him/her for a ride to a doctor or emergency room.  Just to be on the safe side right now, I would check to see if I have a concussion by shining a light in my eyes.
iqGaNZTtaa	Try nasal steroids.    You may need a sinus 'drainage' procedure.
Q4ggnG0waa	Depending on the chemo she's going to be on, is depending what you can do to help her out. I'm on chemo for brain tumor and I'm doing just fine. Haven't lost any more hair since my radiation. It's actually growing back. I drive myself just fine to my dr appts, shopping, etc. I cook at home. Just because someone is going thru chemo, it doesn't make them an invalid and they certainly don't want to be treated like one. The ONLY time I'm not up to par, is 2 days after my chemo is over for the month. I get really tired for about a day. I get on my couch, watch my dvr'd shows and lounge about. She may and probably will, be just fine. If you'd ask her some details, those of us on here going thru what she will be can give some better ideas for you.|`|edFyHFRhaa	This doesn't really affect the day to day happenings but I would get her a really nice head scarf for when the day comes that she starts losing her hair... this will be a really hard time for her.|`|Zm1RnZd7aa	well, make sure they keep their appetite i suggest ice cream and food with a resonable amount of calories because the chemo will mess with their eating habits. im not sure how exactly but it probobly will. it happened to my aunt and my mother. sometimes they will have a wierd taste in their mouth so for that i suggest mouth wash, mints, brushing teeth and strong beverages such as regular or black coffee. i hope that the person recieving chemo is ok during the treatment.|`|9947a1e51b6060e5a8842b07f5ecfa80aa	You're a good friend to have around. Be sensitive to their needs. Also understand that they may not be up to doing normal things for awhile. Food may also be gross to them and they will withdraw from certain activities and probably sleep more. Moral support to them and their family is most important.    I remember when I was in chemo, my skin turned brown and my finger nails became brittle. I'm a man but may recommend you take your friend to a spa day or something if they're up to it. It will be good for them both physically and emotionally, just knowing that someone cares.
GPE1Wojraa	my      second     cousin     had      cancer      and     my     great-aunt's      daughter       had     bone      cancer      and     my     great-aunt's     daughter     lasted      2yrs      or     3yrs       i     believe      before     she     died        but     my     2nd      cousin      died      on     march    9th      of    lastyear      from      cancer      which     had     basically     spread      throughout      her     body       and       resulted   in      her      cancer      being     stage     four       and      considered       terminal.
8AcT5Ir2aa	Hi There,    It was so strange reading your story because now i see it from another family member's perspective. I am in remission for Hodgkins Lymphoma myself, i am almost up to my 1 year post chemo mark and although i have a fair amount of post cancer anxiety; i am feeling pretty good. I've been in remission for a whole year, and i just have 9 years to go until i'm deemed 'cured!'    My heart goes out to you and your sister, it would have been so tough on your whole family. Even though i was the one going through the chemo i often think it was harder on my family to physically watch it all happen.     There's obviously no direct advice that i can give you that's going to solve everything but i can tell you some things that my family and i have done to help one another out. I'll just run through a few suggestions i have for you:    > DON"T read too much on the internet, a lot of it is crapola! If it makes you comfortable GO to the oncologist with your sister with a list of questions. Oncologists can come across as being busy and sometimes a little standoffish but it's your sister so you have a right to ask questions (by the way - i swear to you - from what my oncologist says it's no where near 35% that it's going to come back. Stage 4 is about 80 - 85% cure rate, plus being young and female is an even better case scenario)    >Talk, talk, talk. Keep a diary, keep a blog, see a psychologist (i do), talk to your family, do anything but hold it all in. SOunds cliche but it's true. Stress is evil, in fact stress wears down your immune system. It's a killer.    >Find your inner strength, and your inner positivity, and direct it your sisters way. She needs it, you need it, your family needs it. Easier said than done but try it! Trust me, it's in there somewhere.    >Do yoga and drink green tea. I aint no airy fairy person but i firmly believe this helped me. I made my mum do yoga too (she's perfectly healthy, i just wanted her to do it to ease her mind a little)    >Ask your doctor for a blood test measureing your LDH levels if you are worried about getting hodgkins. I must admit my brother had histiocytosis x, then i got lymphoma (the two are related) so now i am **** scared for my younger brother but the easiest way to reduce anxieties is to find an understanding GP who will run the tests you request.    >have lots of 'you time' Spending time with your sister is lovely, and thoughtful, but you need time for you aswell. I used to make my mum and dad go out for a few hours to a movie or something simply so they wouldn't have to think about me (even though they probably did but still :)     >email me with anything at all> earthchild23@hotmail.com :)|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	I was going to offer you a little support to your question but the wonderful Jelly23 has done this so well.  Take note of everything Jelly23 has said.  She's/he's an inspiration and this must give you a great big boost.  Life isn't pointless - we are all travelling down the same path and along the path we have take what life throws at us.  You sound like a brilliant sister to have so stick with it and be by her side through thick and thin.  She would do it for you, wouldn't she?  You're a star!!
TlHwwnmBaa	You need to see a doctor. If you are not pregnant and have been missing periods long term you could be having PCOS. It is important to get treatment for this condition if you do have it. See your doctor and ask to be tested for this.  Good Luck.|`|9Ve6jDSyaa	try a home pregnancy test. the flu you had, may have been morning sickness. It sounds like you may be. If not. You need to get that checked out. If so you still need to get it checked out. Believe me, mom's are usually the more understanding ones.|`|DYzcHHjeaa	well, shoot. you have so much going on no wonder why you are stressed.   That could be it, stress causing it.   You should go to the gyn anyway. you say problems- again. so something should be checked out.|`|gC7CjJOsaa	it sort of sounds like you are under some anxiety. that can definitely cause a late period. sex can cause changes in your periods. one time i went 3 months without sex and when i had it i got my period out of nowhere. and i was on birth control. birth control is supposed to make you run like a clock. so i'm guessing it could delay it if it could start it. i'm sure you are using protection...but if you are having sex and it's more than a week late, you should take a pregnancy test to make sure it's not a pregnancy. and about the gyno thing.....just think of it as a mechanic looking at a car :) it's just their job....and they wont think anything weird of you. my best friend works for a gynocologist....and i get to hear all her stories. everyone gets worried about that! not comfortable to say the least! i get nervous too :) congrats on cutting back on the smoking!|`|wbuG0efyaa	Stress can mess up your periods and going to the gynecologist is not bad at all  he might put you on birth control if your having problem with your periods|`|ABjypA2raa	Being 18 and having problems with your period is normal. I must say stress and health can definitely cause you to have a delayed period, I went seven months without one and I at the time was still a virgin. You fix could be as simple as being placed on a low dose birth control pill to help regulate your periods.     However, I would still vist the gyno. to see if that is it is. Don't have your parents go in with you to speak with him/her and request that you go ahead and make a follow up appointment where you can privately discuss any possible abnormalties. It isn't all that scarey, I was very uncomfortable my first time too. It isn't the most comfortable thing, but it doesn't hurt or rather it shouldn't since you have had sex before.  they'll place a plastic thing in your vagina and depending on what tests they run will determine how many things they place in the plastic thing to swab your vagina's wall. Just remember to breathe and you'll do fine.    Wishing you the best of!
dNtJ9Ob9aa	Return it and buy some adjustable dumbbells.  So you can go out and buy more weight as your arms get stronger.     Your body weight will only add so much size to your biceps.   You will have to progress somehow after a while by using a dip belt with added weight.  Honestly they won't add alot of size really.  Trust me I know.  I've been doing chinups for years.  Nothing beats some heavy *** dumbbell or barbell work.   Don't get me wrong chinups are essential for a strong back.      Please don't be another guy with just nice guns.  Get big legs, shoulders, chest and back.  Trust me girls would rather have the whole package.  www.t-nation.com is a good site to learn about everything for free!|`|VCyY0WOQaa	its terrible buy|`|aXdFTytvaa	that really sucks cause that thing is hella good, and no you cant modify it.|`|xp40696saa	that is a freakin waste of money.

P544Sbmqaa	Sometimes you can find programs that will sign you up for free.  Other times there are donor drives that will let you sign up for free.  You can find out if there are any of these in your area by contacting the National Marrow Donors Program http://www.marrow.org    The fee they charge only covers a fraction of the typing because it gets into dna testing.  The fee is to help recover some of that money, as the program is publically funded.

Convince yourself that your brain creates your real life, and you have a good brain that lets you dance, that if you are in peace, evrything outside will be in peace, if you are worried maybe some problem comes out, but there's nobody that can damage you, so.. please dont hate being a girl, we know that you are going to make it OK

Lsa2LPrMaa	seriusly i wouldn't ask people on her if your allergic to something.  if you think you are allergic, dont take it!  go to your doctor and do a test to see if you are allergic to it.|`|bqdeD8JHaa	Both chemically and in purpose they are completely different. That doesn't mean you won't be allergic or sensitive to it, just that it would have nothing to do with your allergy to Benzoyl Peroxide.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	The structure and reactivity of these two compounds are very different. It is possible, but I don't think it's likely that you are allergic to benzocaine.|`|Y9icBdsyaa	yea i think so double check though|`|SWS8QWvhaa	lol @ Sky, whoring herself by using other ppls question....pathetic  and u prolly are becuz Benzoyl and Benzocaine both have the word Benzo in it so tht culd prolly be ur reaction|`|GGAgxzJNaa	It's possible, but unlikely.  At any rate you won't be allergic to one just because you're allergic to the other.      You might want to avoid veteran actor Ben Gazzara,  though, just to be on the safe side.|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	I would be curious as to how you determined you are allergic to benzoyl peroxide.  BP is a very powerful irritant that harms your skin as much as it harm bacteria. Its chronic use is destructive to your skin.  For a given pimple, it should only be applied 2-4 times over the course of a week.  More than that and your sensitive skin may display symptoms of allergies.    Benzocaine is not related to benzoyl peroxide aside from the fact that they both contain a benzene molecule.  The terminal chains that the immune system would likely interact, are fundamentally different.    So, no, you won't be allergic to benzocaine.|`|UkhaWSz4aa	No, Benzoyl peroxide is a completley different compound so the chances of you being allergic two both are pretty slim.|`|3rJwDjbwaa	The two medications share nothing in common except a benzene molecule. It's fine.|`|jfmQx9Tbaa	My first question for you would be. Are you truly allergic to benzoyl peroxide? Did you have a true allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis or do you just appear to be sensitive to it's ingredients? Or are you treating any side effects of benzoyl peroxide as allergies? Benzoyl peroxide and benzocaine are two unrelated medications and there is little to no incidence of cross-sensitivity between the two drugs.

iam79Xpzaa	forget diets just eat healthy "no junk food or soda pop" and start exercising there is no quick fix
VJQaZHmLaa	yes you will but you will put on so much more if you don't die first,iv done this before not eat once a week but more like once every 2 days,i fainted and lost muscle and then i ate one sandwich and put on about a kilo anything i ate went straight on my body and in the end i gained all the weight back putting on more for eating like a healthy sandwich a day and the worst part i didnt gain muscle cus you have to work out for it,such a bad choice i know your desperate i was too but this deff not the answer|`|hwIMJBVpaa	yes you will lose weight...but as soon as you start to eat normally again, you will probably be fatter than you were before you lost weight. that ruins your metabolism for the rest of your life. your body gets used to not having food and uses it slower...so when you start to eat again, all the food you eat will be stored as fat. your body thinks it needs to conserve it because you starved yourself before. so if you plan to do that plan on doing it for the rest of your life...and that will be a short one.|`|FxAD44Moaa	lmfao.. NO!      but once you give up you'll go  on a eating binge and probably gain 30lbs in the process.      eat right instead..  no more processed foods..    no more junk.. eat only fresh fruits and veggies.      eating rice?  good god.. that's empty fatty calories!   your triglycerides will jump sky high!    oh, you'll also be anemic and probably end up with colon impaction,  stomach ulcers and die from malnutrition.|`|441GSyaMaa	No, starving yourself is probably more damaging. Your body will begin to eat away at the fats of your body, then certain things in your body that would kind of be needed (I believe your muscle)    Look at Ethiopians, They've been starving, they're as skinny as hell... but if you look at their stomach, it's rather large (abnormally considering they don't eat)    Don't be so silly to starve yourself, you just need to eat healthy, drink water, and exercise...|`|PeCm21meaa	yes you'll lose weight.  you'll also live in an anorexic hell that will haunt you for life.  and you'll be constantly cold, dizzy, irritable, you'll lose your hair... not to mention the long term effects like organ failure (yeah, you could have a heart attack) and looking emaciated and shitty.|`|Xv7p7nRKaa	Actually if you starve yourself, you put the weight on. (ive done this myself) If you eat little and often and do regular exercise you should start losing weight, make sure you eat healthily though otherwise you will end up ill and/or in hospital.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	You will lose weight, much of it muscle, you will have badly sagging skin, likely covered with acne, your breath will smell terrible (ketosis) and your metabolism will slow so much that when you begin eating again even small amounts of food will pack the weight (but not the muscle) back on.    To lose weight safely you need to boost your metabolism, not lower it. There are no shortcuts, no magic bullets. It needs to be a slow, sensible, consistent loss with healthy foods and regular exercise. Cutting back on carbs (cutting back, not cutting out) is more effective than cutting back on fats.  Combine reduced processed carbs (bread, pasta, sugary drinks, beer etc. plus no potatoes) with exercise, simply brisk walking will do, and you begin to lose weight by a steady and safe amount each week.|`|o8Xfn2bfaa	You KNOW asking that on here will never get you a serious answer, just a lot of people telling you how unhealthy it is.|`|8aEUuEBNaa	The pattern for losing weight is not difficult - eat less food and workout more - the problems arise when we really try to put that into operation! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?! The sole diet which really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it was reported in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away 20 pounds, it really does produce success!|`|sVcnkh1faa	You'll lose weight, but your teeth will rot out of your head and you'll die of scurvy if you keep it up long enough.      Why don't you look into a healthy weight loss alternative like Weight Watchers?  If you're not into counting points they have a "core" program where you basically get a list of foods you can eat as much of as you want.|`|Hhxs0mRxaa	Yeah, but you'd probably die. And I'm not lying. But the only weight you'd loose is muscle mass, so you should really exercise, and eat healthy. I'm not kidding, you will DIE. (It's call anorexia.)|`|bH1DYr5saa	Of course you will lose weight if you starve yourself. However, because your body isn't getting any or enough food to function properly, it will go into 'Starvation mode'. This means that the body will try to turn any precious food it gets straight into fat reserves because it doesn't know when its next meal is.    As you well know, exercise is the best method. A little cardio with some light weight training / toning. By toning up and increasing your muscle mass, the more muscle you have means that more calories are needed to keep them going = more weight loss.
ub6641d2aa	I used to feel the exact same way as you. I graduated last year and I was severely depressed and had alot of anxiety. I even tried to slit my wrists. Thank god, I didnt die. You can go see a doctor and they can put you on medicine that can help control this and you will feel 110% better.    Good Luck  cassandra|`|G9VBTg47aa	Many people feel like that http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1xJR8RTZ...|`|NrOJ24hSaa	Please try talking to a different counselor, maybe someone that could help you better. I used to be very shy too and I know how hard it is. Trust that you will grow out of it and just take tiny steps to put yourself out there. Join a club or find a new hobby. When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself that you are a wonderful person and that you are going to make the most out of this day. I promise things will get better :)|`|nc1whD2Daa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|CpkqD5L5aa	The act that you have posted this question is a clear sign that you want to be helped, which is already a good sign.  I believe that because you have done so, a part of you still somewhat wants to cling onto life.  I must tell you that I have been in your position before so I can imagine the pain and fear that you must be facing right now.  If anyone responds by insulting you for being in your current state, please disregard their comments because they have no right to judge the person that you are.  I want you to know that help is available, despite how it may seem.  Right now, I'd like to ask you to go this site.    http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/    You may have already been to this site, but please go to it again if you have and read what it says.  Then, I want you to contact a psychiatrist asap.      Now, let me tell you about my experience.  I was depressed from the age of 14 until 19, and I had actually attempted suicide at one point.  But today, I am the happiest I have ever been, and it was not due to any one specific factor but instead an accumulation of efforts to help myself.  One source that I strongly believe saved my life was my antidepressants, Effexor XR.  Also, simply talking to someone that you love and trust is another way.      Although I don't know you and will probably never know you, please know that I genuinely care about you.  I've been in your situation and I know that it's painful, but believe me, it CAN and WILL get better.  If you want to continue to talk, please e-mail me by click on the e-mail link on my profile.  Good luck.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	seriously you sound more like someone who just wants attention and you want everyone to feel sorry for you because i think you know that running your car of the road wont kill you unless you slam it straight into a tree or something solid at 100-150kmh and even then you would probably only injure yourself.    there's more to life then thinking of suicide and s*** all the time,you would realize that if you actually tried to enjoy life instead of  driving around like an idiot thinking about running your car off the road .    wake up to yourself emo boy.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	When people are depressed they always tend to think "no one would care if I died" This is never true. You would hurt many people if though you don't believe it. Maybe call a sucide hotline or tell your mother. Maybe she doesnt know how serious this is or is dealing with some issues of her own as well. If you wernt ment to be here God would of already called you home. He hasnt and there is a reason.|`|AA11149658	It's time to speak your mind!  (Just like you did here, but real people are better than interactive robots, such as the computer).|`|W5aPsgMBaa	Just please rethink this. Ending your life or just thinking about it is not the best thing. So what I want u to do is to talk to your parents and/or a school consalor or a trustworthy friend or family member. Suicide is not the only way to get away from your prpblems. Just please rethink this because belive it or not I went to the same thing. I just told someone how I felt. Now I'm all better. So just think things over. And don't turn to drugs and alchohal either.|`|P8A7WOIZaa	Don't end your life!  Please seek help from a professional counselor or therapist, or call a suicide hotline (1-800-suicide or 1-800-273-talk). Just graduating from high school, you are at a hard part of your life.  Things will get better, I promise!  And I think that maybe your depression and anxiety are giving you a distorted view of your life.  I am sure that there are people that care about you, even if they don't show it.  Please talk to a professional!|`|AwWV4K5caa	You have 2 things in your favor. First, there's a question mark after your "I'm going to end my life" which means you're not sure and second, you took the time to type this all out on the computer.This tells me you are a survivor and only looking for affirmation. Life will always throw curve balls at you...that's life. There are ups and downs; happiness and sadness. But in the end it is worth living. Go back to your doctor and go back on your meds....they will help while you are going through this episode of your life. People do care. It is up to you to find them;guidance counselors, clergy, etc.  I wish you the best of luck and life.|`|Yl1eAhamaa	sorry you feel this way; suicide is not the answer though. you said u dont like yourself and this is the key to your problem. get a paper and write down all that u dont like about yourself. then try to find something that u like about yourself. you will definitely find something even though u are biased against yourself. then spend more time thinking about those things that u like about yourself than those that u dont like about yourself. this will be like taking a turn in your mind. like when u are driving a car u reach a an intersection and u make a turn either left or right. likewise take this turn in your mind to think about anything good about you and your life even if it is not much.   another thing you have to work on and this is very important. look at yourself and see how u punish your self. in your mind by thinking that u r no good and in your actions that cause u to feel bad. then stop punishing yourself. try to avoid thoughts and actions that cause you to punish yourself. you have to think deep about this and preferably write down how u punish yourself. once you can stop punishing yourself you will be a totally different person. but this punishing yourself is a habit and you have to work on it to break it like any other bad habit.   so the first step is to make the turn in your mind as described above. this will put your mental car in the right direction. when u have taken the right direction know that you are headed towards a destination that will be good for you; thats all u have to do; set yourself in the right direction.
NaJPIOheaa	hey dear.. this could be many different things.. when your on birth control, your adding hormones to your body, your body is so used to these extra hormones that when you suddenly stop taking birth control, your body has to get used to it, and every girl adjusts differently. Another thing, it does sound like you could be pregnant, i would get a pregnancy test just to be sure, because the pull out method does not work! I too had anemia, and did not have cramps and sore breasts. Take a pregnancy test & the best of luck xo|`|GR07LyyTaa	never had the depo but i've heard it really screws with your body, my friend had it and didn't have a period for like 6mths.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	The depo shot is the devil.  Seriously.  When I was your age I used to get it and it always did weird things to my period and my body chemistry.  You just have to give your body time to get it out of your system and balance itself again.  You'll get back to normal.  It just takes time.  I recommend finding a different birth control method.  Although, honestly, all birth control methods I used (depo, the pill, IUD)affected me adversely.  After I had my second son, I got my tubes tied and it's been a god send.  No more weird periods, mood swings, and strange things going on with my body.  Good luck to you.|`|gC7CjJOsaa	maybe you could go see your doctor to make sure you're healthy :) are you on the pill? i know lots of girls who have gotten pregnant using the pull out method :) it doesnt really work. my doctor told me that the odds of getting pregnant when he pulls out, and the odds of getting pregnant when he doesn't are about the same. so basically pulling out is pointless. a pregnancy test couldn't hurt :)|`|phCae73Kaa	the pull out method is not 100% nor the 99.9% effective like everything else. you can still get pregnant from it.  i suggest you take a pregnancy test... its better to know now than later.

My nose ring does this time to time, it almost looks like a pimple over my nose piercing.  Don't use soaps that have fragrance, because it may irritate it and make it worse.  So, while in the shower, avoid putting soap or shampoo around the infected area and use something unscented and good at killing bad bacteria (try dabbing some mouth wash on it) when you get out.  If it continues to infect and worsen, talk to a physician.|`|vrGjDDmzaa	put some alchohal on it and call ur dr
sVcnkh1faa	Posture is a habit.  You've developed bad posture out of habit, and the best way to improve it is to practice, practice, practice.  It's not something I've done personally -- as I sit her slouched typing this out - but here's just a couple of brainstormy ideas that might help:    - Put up a couple note reminders where you might see the, cuing yourself to sit straight.    - I have no idea if this would work, but you could try to use first aid tape, and put a length of tape along your mid-spine every day (from top to bottom, just three or four inches should do the trick).  When you slouched, I would think it would pull at the tape, giving you a physical reminder to sit up straight as soon as you started slouching.  It would probably be uncomfortable to bend over though.    Good luck!  I really admire people with good posture.|`|3Z9npp2maa	Hold your head high. The rest of the body will follow.

UZxeBrxQaa	You are compressing the cornea and forcing the image to focus on your retina.  The cornea is flexible.  It your cornia is too long, the image is focused in front of the retina.

My inkling would be that our eyes work like a camera (like the f/stops or aperture on a camera) in that the smaller the lens (or eye), the less light will come in, yet the greater detail we can pick up. Like with a really small f/stop like 2, we can focus in a subject. Maybe your depth of field is played with. Also, think of a pinhole camera which uses a really small aperture.   Also kinda like when you make your thumb and pointer finger into a small circle and look through it, you can see better.|`|c6oApsD7aa	Because when you squint your eyes are focussing on a specific spot which then allows you to see better :]

Lb5u2aJqaa	You have definitely made some good choices.  It's hard to predict when you will see a difference as it depends on how many calories you are consuming per day vs. how  much you intend to lose.  My suggestion would be to count how many calories you are eating per day (don't go below 1500 for women) and you will be able to determine how much you will lose.  There are many weight loss calculator's on line to help!  Just don't become obsessed.  As they say...slow and steady wins the race :)|`|5HtRcpWqaa	I don't think you consider what you're doing "A diet".   That's a bad outlook to have, because then you'll believe that just because you've reached your goal, you can stop eating healthy.  You have to make a lifestyle change in order to change your body shape for good.  What you're doing right now sounds like a good plan.  You don't have to exercise an hour a day, just do enough so that you're satisfied.   If you start your lifestyle change now, it shouldn't be long before your body starts appearing more toned to you.  Don't expect results quickly though.  By the summer, you should have achieved the goal you primarily wanted if you keep up your healthy living plan.  Good luck. :)|`|3YCs5nDJaa	it will take one week.........  well also follow the tips given below  http://www.maintain-health.blogspot.com
pa7hVLAHaa	Try re-synchronizing your sleeping patterns.  Go to bed at 10 and wake up at 6 every morning including weekends.  If you nap during the day set your alarm to go off in 20 minutes.  Don't drink caffeine as this can disrupt your sleeping patterns.  Do at least 30 minutes of exercise a day.  Eat your biggest meal for breakfast and smallest for dinner to give you more brain energy in the morning and less at night when you need to sleep.  Dim the lights and no TV or computer 30 minutes before bed.  Upon waking, go outside in the sunlight for a while and take deep breaths.  Once this becomes a pattern your problem should be solved.  Good luck.
bxG44kULaa	Take answers from here with a pinch of salt, because if anyone here is a medical professional, they haven't examined you. Nausea after eating anything could be something as short-term as food poisoning or gastric flu, or indeed something more serious such as a peptic ulcer, a tumour, or even Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.    Another idea might be the Norovirus, although this has been extremely common in the UK, and I don't know where you live. It's known as the "winter vomiting virus" (http://www.wsh.nhs.uk/InfectionControl/W...    You need to find out what is causing this - whether it's a bacterium (which can be treated with antibiotics), a virus (which can't), bad food or something more serious. You should follow the doctor's advice and get Prilosec, and see if it works, because they need to rule out whether or not it'll be effective. Depending on where you live, if Prilosec doesn't work, you'll likely be referred to a gastroenterologist for specialist advice, Good luck.|`|AA10200409	It wouldn't hurt to use some benefiber in your food or water. Sometimes you can get that nausea and bloated feeling from not eating enough fiber.    If it doesn't go away soon, see another doctor.|`|AA11974702	if you experience nausea after eating, try to avoid hot foods like soup. i experienced that before and a friend of mine who happens to be a dentist told me not to eat hot foods, and walaa.. i felt better :)|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	You need to have your doctor do an endoscopy to find out for sure what is wrong,x rays can't tell you everything.Could be an ulcer,reflux,gastritis,Hpylori,I have had all of these and you have some of the symptoms,if I were you I would take the Prilosec,I think it will help a lot.|`|QA62m6Y7aa	the prilosec might actually help you because it controls acid in your stomach, and stomach acid could be the cause of your stomach problems|`|AA12041870	Look up H-pylori and see if your symptoms match.  You could also have an ulcer, a tumor, which won't show up on X-ray (what a waste of money that was) or, God forbid, something as serious as cancer.  You need to see a different doctor.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	Use what he gave you. It could be that your stomach is having problems digesting and that's why it hurts. Just try it and see if it works or not.     I had stomach problems and found that when I just made myself eat normal again (yes it made my stomach hurt a lot at first), it went back to normal. You might have to gradually add more solid foods (ones that you know don't usually upset your stomach).     Think about when you first started getting them.
652f1ace7d0e4554d654822f229e8c9daa	No you are not wierd, but that phobia is real because I have it. I am terrified of needles. If i would watch i would pass out within a second. I don't cry, but had this phobia for many years. Something I had to get used to because I have blood work done every 3mths. The nurses know me now that they hide the needles and tell me to look away. My heart starts beating faster until they are done. I can't even think about it because it freaks me out!   One time, there was a 16 yr girl getting blood work and she was freakin bad, crying the whole 9 yards. I asked the nurse without turning around is she going to be okay?? and the nurse replied, she is terrified of needles like you! I said, " I fully understand that is why I look away"|`|pVJJ9R85aa	nope, i love getting shots, but when I sit there and see the doc with the needle i get scared too|`|y9z65Rndaa	no its totally normal plus when you get shots regularly then you'll get use to the sight of the needle|`|5cSD8mcZaa	I went to school to give shots and all the medical stuff, and we had to practice on each other.    If an injection is done correctly, you should not feel any pain beyond a faint sting. It is certainly nothing to get all worked up about.     If you are afraid of freaking out, remember that most girls often prick themselves with a sewing needle while sewing on a button. If you have ever done anything similar, the pain is no greater than that.

When they can't get their pills or haven't taken them for a while the addict can likely be very irritable or prone to seizures or strokes. In some cases when people are on the pill they get very very active and can stay up for nights at a time and then just pass out after a while. Also at times the addict can't think straight and might appear very stupid because the pill kills a lot of senses and makes you very numb. Addicts are also prone to not eating at all or eating very little, practicing little to no good hygiene, great dependance on the pill, severe paranoia, and severe inability to take care of oneself despite their own beliefs.|`|4onMCULuaa	Well sweetie,it depends on if there uppers or downers.It also depends on the type.Um muscle relaxers.pain killers. anti depresents,anti sycotics.What have you.Really good moods.Um really bad moods.Um anxiousness.Tired all the time.Full of energy.Um in just one of those whatever moods.     nothing matters.ect.ect.Getting snippy or snappy.Or not wanting to talk at all.ask her how she feels.If she says tingly well then that is a pretty good assumtion cuz most pills do that no matter what they are.Um parinoia.Thats all i can think of right now.Muscle relaxers make you mopy and tired and nothing bothers you.pain killers just make you feel funny.Hard to say if i saw her id probly know if she was or wasnt.You can tell if you know what your looking for.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	oh gosh,,, i hope she doesn't,,that is all you need ,you are a Mother Hen honey always taking care and worrying about everybody,you poor thing,,but i don't know how to tell unless she has mood swings when she runs out of them and says shes got to have them,if so you need to hide her medicines,,then see what she thinks and acts,,i wish you luck sweetie,,hang in there and take care of YOU,, too,,love ya..|`|oxmkllnWaa	does she run out before the prescription does?    like she's prescribed 4 a day, 1 every 6 hours, and gets 120 pills for the month... and she's out by day 15....
YEd9Q5KZaa	I think it depends on the person. Some people get the occasional zit, and other people have full out acne, even when they are adults. Chances are you will grow out of it, but it's possible you're just going to have to deal with it for years.|`|68r4mmOnaa	I actaully never had acne. If you want it to go away, you might want to treat it with some cream. But yes,  it will go away. Have you ever seen 40 year olds or even 25 year olds with acne?|`|9e9cde7014bcc39a96640226e314273baa	It will slow down, but it could also go into adulthood and become adult acne.  There's plenty of medication out there to take care of it.  Acne really isn't that much of a problem nowadays because of all the medicine.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Yes, but it *may* become adult acne.    I suggest you look at your diet for trans-fatty acids, and do your best to eliminate them gradually from your diet. Trans fats are the junk oils used in deep frying and food manufacture a LOT. Replace with HDLs which are better known as the 'good' oils like Olive, Grapeseed, Coconut, Almond, etc. Then find a good quality Zinc supplement, Vit C and take them daily.

K4zsztkRaa	I have excema aswell and I get it really bad on my hands, and I work with my hands at work and a lot of the stuff I get my hands into cause my hands to swell up and crack. It's nasty.  Try to get your sister to another doctor, she sound like she needs steroid creams or other treatments. If the doctors you are visiting right now aren't helping, switch doctors.    What really helps me and it sometimes burns I'm not going to lie, But I get a bowl of really hott water and I put some sea salt in there and let my hands soak for a while and it really helps. Especialy out here in Colorado where the air is thin and dry as crap!    Also try getting her non-soap cleaners for her hands to wash her hand with.  Also don't get her any soaps or lotions that have scents in it.    Also has she ben tested for other things? Like possible skin allergies?    I get them. Like I'm allergic to deoderant and a bucnh of stuff and if it comes in contact with my skin I get a big break out.    -Connor|`|By1DJAUOaa	okay, i have eczema but i grew out of it so i have beautiful gorgeous skin now but when i wash my hair i use olive oil shampoo and after i get out the shower i dry off and there is this stuff called "hydrocortisone" and you can get it at walgreens and she can put that on and then there is this stuff called Keri loition and that's at Walmart and she can put that on once she has put on the hydrocortisone and that should stop her from itching and breaking out i do that everyday, it's not time consuming although it sounds that way really works...|`|GyqZPLCRaa	I have eczema & it used to be really bad . I used Dove for soap, and aquaphor or vanicream for lotion . They're all really good for eczema because they don't irritate the skin.. but vanicream may not keep her skin moisturized if it's really bad so use aquaphor. It may itch a bit when she first switches soaps/lotions since her skin is really sensitive (mine always does when I use anything new). Stay away from heat/sun exposure, stress, & scratching .    Also, if it's possible, get a water softener if you don't already have one. It can help a bit.|`|FDj6rzl9aa	I have terribly sensitive, dry, cracked skin.  I just started using vegetable glycerin on my hands and it is amazing! It is a little slimy/oily at first when you put it on, but I have not had ANY problems since I started using it.  I got mine from www.iherb.com.  I don't know if there are any local stores that sell it.  Good luck!

4flomCyJaa	Suppositories are quickly absorbed into the blood stream, whereas oral medications have to be digested before absorption. It makes sense to give young children suppositories, because the medicine starts working faster. Your doctor was just looking out for you, especially if you spiked a high fever.|`|yvQpQjv1aa	sometimes they do that if you are very ill. maybe there was a chance if given orally you wouldn't have kept it down?

rK10qmVHaa	That happened with my friend. She only uses one pad a day and it stinks. It smells like a family of skunks living in her pants. All you have to do is tell her that it looks like she started to bleed through her pants. Then she'll change her pad.|`|CpzlUpEnaa	okay ew.  i know how u feel.  my friend had the same problem when she walked in the halls of the school alot of people could smell this disgusting smell.    anyway, it's best just to let her know nicely that she needs to do something about it.|`|QRpE4Tbdaa	What type of pad does she use?     I use Always scented brand and that truly masks the odor. Just find out if she uses a scented one and if she doesn't ..just hint that the Always scented brands are very comfortable and will keep that blood smell down.|`|5yhamK5maa	you should have a talk with her...if she is your close friend she wouldnt feel wierd. ask her questions like how often do you change your pad. She might know how often she suppose to change it. just talk to her if I was her i will look at it as your looking out for me...just imagine what other people will think or they might even talk trash about her. So help help her out and let her know.|`|BBnMEFIqaa	Tell her. If she is a real friend, she won't be offended.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	This is not an easy situation to face.  And you are right, it sounds like she doesn't change her pad very often.  Casually bring up having periods and talk about how often you should change a tampon - usually not more than 4 hours - and say something like.........."I know if you don't change your pad regularly it creates a smell. I change mine when I notice the smell because I'm affraid others will smell it.... do you?"      Hope you work it out.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Maybe ask her how often she changes her towel. Pretend you're worried you change yours too often or something and you need her advice. Or maybe she just has really heavy periods and so much blood gathers that she doesn't have time to change it before it starts to smell. If that is the probem, she really needs to see a doctor because that is not normal so you'd have to mention it. You could just take her to one side and say gently "I'm sorry but are you on your period? Your pad is starting to smell, I just thought you should know". Hopefully she'll appreciate your honesty.|`|MlmbevHwaa	the only way to stop the smell i to change the pad often. She obviously has a heavy flow..  i dont know what to tell you to tell her but yeah.  im sorry that i couldnt be more of a help|`|tTu4S1X2aa	Ouch that is a tough question because you don't want to hurt her feelings.

Hope that helps!|`|bqisLny9aa	it will be even more embarrassing if you don't tell her. just say nicely that i think you need to "change"

If you are truly that worried, take the can and wash it with bleach and hot water and dry thoroughly.

3SNhXpf0aa	Stop eating so much then. Not trying to be rude but it really is in your power. If you are unable to workout or exercise due to injury, you should eat your maintenance amount of calories. But an example of an exercise you can do is 6 inches. Lay on the floor, put your hands under your butt, lift your legs about 6 inches off the floor and hold for 5 seconds, then slowly go down. Do 3 sets of about 8 reps of these.|`|0OFDLHJaaa	just do crunches, sit ups, pull ups, and push ups since u dont need your foot to do those. also, try entertaining your self so you dont eat as much.|`|MFYiwCVYaa	Try stretching with your arms and waist.

fmhAjr3Taa	Try some sports that your interested in, they do warm ups and stuff, keep track of how many calories you eat, the average amount is two thousand.  Eat this amount of calories one week, then continue to lesson the amount of calories, (1900, 1800, 1700, etc.), every week. But don't go up to zero though! Stop at around nine hundred. Don't eat fat food, (Cake, donuts, etc.), and you'll lose weight.|`|MXAZ7Vohaa	jogging,crunches,sit ups, and just set a mental goal for yourself.. its all in you head|`|Qfto0pF1aa	i am exactly like you. but i eat vegetables.    im a vegetarian, and i eat super healthy.    i exercise everday or sometimes twice a day.   and i dont look my weight.    but statistically im overweight.    maybe get tested for thyroid problems.  This makes you gain weight, and not lose it no matter what.|`|sBwFH04Daa	I tried everything to lose weight, and nothing worked until I tried acai berry.

E0PQQaNjaa	If I shave the inside it gets really itchy. I like to wax much, much better. Yes, it really hurts. A lot. But it is smooth for over a month, grows in thinner and is so much cleaner feeling than shaving. If you are going to wax a recommend 1) trim hair short first 2) buy wax specifically for that area that includes soothing after treatment 3) dust lightly with baby powder  4) practice several times on your legs or face first to get really good at waxing and then most importantly 5) have a few cocktails first. Or if you are underage - OTC pain pills that are approriate for your age and health issues about an hour before hand can really help.|`|BBnMEFIqaa	I use Nair for sensitive skin.|`|NuvKPl3naa	well just the outside. you should not have hair on the inside. be sure to use shave cream and a very good razor.|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	Don't shave at all.

Just use a good shaving cream and do it carefully.|`|X36cVh4faa	Before you shave, sit in a warm bathtub for at least 15 minutes, this will soften the follicles and help prevent razor burn. It's best to use a brand new razor, since it is really sensitive and you DEFIANTLY don't want to cut yourself down there. Use a good amount of shaving cream, and reapply as needed. If you still do happen to get razor burn, put a wet washcloth in the freezer and let it get cold. Lay it across your vagina, believe me it works!|`|f25136f77bb8e33b645c3b0896a24e5baa	You can shave between the labia, but pull the skin taught and proceed very slowly with the razor. Use plenty of shaving cream. Do be careful, because if you get cut, it will sting a lot more than a cut on another part of your body. But if you're like me and going near that area with a sharp object makes you nervous, you can trim the hair with a small pair of scissors. There is less of a risk of cutting yourself this way.|`|IY3XBGcGaa	just the outside.|`|rv9nDch2aa	I shave the entire thing. And around the sensitive part, I be really carefully!!|`|0HOGn7njaa	I take care of all of it, just not every day because it gets difficult. if you can stick out having hair for a few weeks and can take getting it waxed its worth is i swear!
w4HkJujcaa	Yes they are a hundred or two I have sonicare and love it.  It gets plaque off that you cannot get off other ways.  Also realize the dentist uses something like this when they clean your teeth.  You will be amazed at how much better your teeth will feel.|`|aeP8GDWmaa	Ultrasonics are used to clean jewelry.  Teeth are a lot like jewelry.  The vibrations can help loosen particles.  Any particles not on your teeth is better than if they stay.  The particles eventually produce acid which dissolves your tooth enamel.  I do not have one and have no idea how much they cost.

V35iLr9Zaa	I used to have TMJ and i prayed for it to go away. I was around 12 when i found out that i had TMJ. I was running through a very haunted walk on halloween and a guy scared the hell out of me and i screamed and instantly my jaw started aching very painfully. I started getting a migrane and i thought i was going to die. So i went to one of those healing seminars one summer because i thought it might work and a couple of months later i noticed i never felt that pain before. (I had more than the one occurance) It was yesterday when i was in my school and a friend thought it would be funny and jump out at me and scare me. I screamed at the top of my lungs and stopped short and grabbed my jaw. I was waiting for the pain, but it never came. No one can truly know on here if you'll be in pain forever. But as a Christian i will say, "With Him anything is possible"! Am i not right?|`|ukF0Oqg8aa	Megs,     I know the pain, literally.  I was grinding my teeth everynight and my jaw killed me.  Then, they told my I had "Bruxism" and I didn't even know what that was.  My mom sent me to the dentist, who then sent me to a therapist.  What was going on?  My friend then told me about this program:  http://TheBestListOnline.Com/cure-teeth-...  Anyway, long story short, I downloaded this book, started reading, and after implementing the procedures, I got rid of my grinding forever.  I hope this helps!    Good luck,  Martha
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	diet and exercise. OMG try the Atkins! I lost 13 lbs. and a total of 6 inches in TWO weeks! Its amazing!

Everyone thinks they should look like Miley Cyrus to look good and that just is not true.    Everyone sees all these black girls in rap videos and they think thats what they all look like. They see it, but they don't think about it. They don't notice that they begin to think all black girls should have a big butt and what not. If I were you, I wouldn't listen to the media or anybody else under the age of 25. If you are in school still, its ok because everybody in high school is superficial and is obsessed with looks.|`|uUvV7eadaa	I think black people look better when they're bigger, I don't know, it just looks better.     its sort of like clothes, if I wear white, it makes me look fatter than if I were to wear a darker color. so it might be the same with our skin, the different colors make us look different sizes? I don't know, I just think black people look good when they're bigger.|`|f6CGwdfOaa	maybe cuz all they see is scronny white girls and most black girls are more curvy? im white and im really curvy but..i do get called fat lol. oh well just ignore it :)
ONooURxIaa	Creatine needs to be consumed one of two ways to get a benefit from it.    1) 3-5 grams a day for 30 days    or    2) 25-30 grams per day for 5 days    Either of these will maximize your stored creatine levels.  At that point, consume 2-3 grams per day to maintain the high level.  Creatine, in it's digestable form takes a few hours to get to your cells, but it will remain there for a while.  So, you should consume the earlier in the day to allow proper absorption.  If you workout in the morning, take some before you go to bed.    After the workout you need to consume a minimum of 20 grams of protein within 45 minutes to maxmize the absorption into your muscles.  Blend it with some carbs and and it will get to your cells even faster.  Another shake about 90 minutes later wouldn't be bad either.|`|wgTioReRaa	there is pre and post-workout creatine suppliments. depends on what you have.    regular creatiene i would do before.     as far as the protein, the most important time to take it is right after your work out. but also make sure you have one gram of protein for every lb you weigh every day. protein is normaly taken 3 times a day.|`|DFug1qB2aa	No i think u should take the protein before and the creatine after I dont think it really matters when i took them both i took them together and got the same results|`|u0BFYYedaa	you should take the creatine about 30 mins before working out then take the protien shake as soon as you can after lifting|`|S4qLj0CCaa	you can take creatin every day as a supplement so your body can be always full with protein.  use creatin after you work out and you can use it 30-40 minutes before you go work out.    the  other way is after each work out you can mix a little bit of protein with a little bit of creatin and that will lead to max effect of strength.    usualy you should take creatin before your work out and protein after your work out.|`|X12R8rdGaa	You should take the protein shake in the morning and the creatine maybe an hour before you work out
mG2lZRrXaa	Underbites are usually a medical necessity, because they cause mastication dysfunction. However, not all insurances accept the costs.
2qPtGTNcaa	Olive oil and mineral oil help a lot. First, though, pour some witch hazel into a cotton ball and apply it to your scalp. Part your hair as though you are going to braid it. Witch hazel will stop your itching. Then, wash your hair with Neutrogena T with activated charcoal. This shampoo is your best bet to stop dermatitis, which by the way is the reason your scalp may be itching.  Once a week, on the night before you plan to wash your hair, apply olive oil or mineral oil to your scalp. This will condition your scalp and help prevent itching in the future.|`|xYoJK4bVaa	stick with the dandruff shampoo and just wash your hair thoroughly. its gonna get a lot worse before it gets better  :)|`|AA11280073	The best product to use is Neutragena T Gel. It is totally effective. If that doesn't work, you you need to see a dermatologist. You may have psoriasis, not dandruff.|`|UHip02Gxaa	Have you tried Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo?  It doesn't smell very good but it works very well on dandruff.      Have you seen a dermotologist?|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Stick with a dandruff shampoo and conditioner consistently. It takes a while for it to work. You could be washing your hair too much, so maybe think about a dry shampoo.     Also make sure you don't have lice.
YEd9Q5KZaa	I really don't like axe, I think I like old spice the best.|`|ep8iy5YNaa	OLD SPICE all the way. really the smell of a man wearing old spice deoderant drives me insane. oh it smells so good!|`|9nDhR7xWaa	Lynx is a woman magnet hahahahah.|`|68r4mmOnaa	I like AXE    But if you want cloan stuff, BVLGARI is a good one.|`|2iFQerjraa	Old spice is the best.|`|AA12022261	OLD SPICE is popular but axe has better smell varieties
y4SUDnpaaa	You are cutting or self harming and I would bet it will only get worse if you don't get some professional help. Cutting is just a way to divert mental distress into something else painful that temporarily takes your mind off your problems.......it's a kind of release and not a suicidal symptom. This kind of behavior is just the manifestation of a much deeper problem which is the most important reason to get professional mental health help. Read some of the other questions on her about cutting, people who have so many scars they have to keep them covered up. If you could stop self harming by yourself you would do it. If it was that easy everyone who self harms would do it. I hope that convinces you that you need help.|`|6qsocyK3aa	The term is called "self-harming" and it can be anything from small scratches to scratches that draw blood to taking overdoses.|`|ULx2vAB1aa	you are cutting. it doesn't matter if it bleeds. if you intentionally cause harm to your body, even if it is a scratch, and it leaves a mark, then you are self harming, or cutting. their are no qualifications to being a cutter, so even if you only scratch, you're still a cutter. but i think the better term for you would be a self harmer|`|8Ak1FehYaa	yes, vutting is just barely scratching the surface to, to get the pain out, to feel some pain because you can;t feel pain, cutting to bleed as well is cutting. I use to see a women who was all stressed out ashe use to scratch herself. Yes, if you cover them up, yes.|`|R7FmZb3Qaa	It is still cutting. And if you are the one doing it, stop!|`|PhMDbw7Zaa	no...  cutting is when you break the surface of your skin.  if the person just scratches their arm its still considered as self harming,  its just not called cutting.  hope that helps  xx|`|wiSeqYleaa	well its not cutting strictly speaking and the intention is not to die but there is still self harm and the intention to cause pain, if you or someone you know is cutting you should get some help|`|RUCrhhWuaa	OK well a year ago i started cutting and now i don't but really it is  really and form of "self"hamring" method w/e it maybe my ex use it cut and got put in the hopspital for cutting to deep and well really any form of cutting counts??|`|cfvAJJqdaa	do you not understand the english language? to cut means to cut.    If you have meat on your plate and you need to cut it into smaller chunks for a child to eat, scratching it would not accomplish this.    cuts are cuts so if you want to show off on myspace and wherever about being a "cutter" then you'd be best to actually have some cuts. scratching is technically self harm, but it's so tame that it can only be seen one way, and that's what it blatently is: nothing more than attention seeking. Scratching is not going to harm you, so don't bother talking about it like it's even an issue.    Self Harmers also do not just have a cut that's just enough to break the skin. Cutting is a serious problem where they slice and cut into their arm and blood flows out.     If you went to the doctors over this they would know that you are just attention seeking and not for real. They would be rolling their eyes when you weren't looking because you are nowhere near disturbed, or a person who has a "cutting" problem
VNRJnNr2aa	Stay with a doctor prescribed diet...      balance your food       do not eat a steady diet of potato's and starchie foods      this will increase your blood sugar intake      use splenda artifical sugar it works with your diabetic systemic      cycle and lower your sugar cravings       avoid alot of oil base frying       if frying use water when frying hamburger       meat frying meat,meat has its own oil when frying with a half cup a water to a quarter pound of hamburger meat and pork          steam your vegetables because these are water-based foods        use a knee deep metal strainer in a boiling pan         boiling water will steam your vegetables with real butter the real butter will thin out and will lock flavor in and produce good cholestrol      in your blood stream           for mineral supplement take chronimum tablets and complex B's       all B's vitamins together B2 B6 B12 all the B family B 's help you reglulate your sugar level when it drops and you will not lose energy       once you practice this for 6months you will maintain balanced sugar levels that will not tramatically drop fast.then you can cheat a little         and slowly bring yourself back to this rule of diet.|`|Knz8iJSWaa	you can get all the information from following link,it is very useful,i followed that..|`|bIaywrBCaa	He should eat lots of protein and fruits and veggies. Whole wheat breads. Sounds like he is doing good. it is unusual for someone with a healthy lifestyle to develop diabetes. Eat carbs in small amounts. Alcohol should be avioded or used in moderation.|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	Follow the guidlines for a diabetic diet avoiding starchy foods like potatoes and rice. Extra exercise helps if you have overeaten a few forbidden foods. Fruit intake also has to be monitored. Meals must be eaten at regular times. Sometimes if sugar levels drop corrections have to be made by having a barley sugar but as a rule sugar and sweets have to be avoided. A good balanced diet avoiding fat is best.|`|AA12029412	Avoid eating rice too often. It has the highest carb count that unused carbs become sugar and fat.
f8mLpPXlaa	You've got to take the bull by the horns to get their attention. Tell them that their smoking is bothering your asthma. If they still don't do anything you can report them to child services for putting your life in danger.This is not something that you want to say "oh, I don't want to cause that much trouble" just do it or you'll be paying the consequences for the rest of your life.|`|gzFt39EXaa	Tell them to smoke outside my mom does that and I never have to worry about getting secondhand smoke. And if your on the road just tell them to take a smoke break maybe at a gas station or something.

Do your hobbies,thatl cheer you up.|`|zSRAeohcaa	Being 14, and going through school having "glints" of happiness is perfectly normal.    If you want to be happy more. Just find something that you know makes you happy, (you want to be pretty sure about this) do it more often, think about it, and see if anybody shares your thoughts.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Don't label yourself as "depressed", man.  You are you.|`|652f1ace7d0e4554d654822f229e8c9daa	No it isn't depression. We all have days where we seem happier than most days. That is normal.   If you are feeling this way ( depressed) remember you are only 14 and your going through some bodily changes as well as such emotional changes.   Everything is okay, no worries :)
Q2Sx1Du3aa	nope...you have to have it in longer than like 8 hours..  i know people that actually set an alarm in the middle of the night to change it so they dont chance getting tss  as long as you change it on a regular basis youll be fine..you need to change it on a regular basis anyways to prevent getting infections|`|m7XevWmEaa	no, it has to be for quite a while.  its actually even long that 8 hours and its extremely rare.|`|cMXZ8FN8aa	You would most likely have to be bleeding extremely heavy, normally they say change it every 4 hours. Make sure you never wear one to bed either, the stories I have read on toxic shock syndrome (while rare) is usually when the girl fell asleep with it in overnight.

9735d5833f65114f4de1c4472750fa51aa	My 3 year old daughter (asthmatic and also has a rare interstitial lung disease) was hospitalized for six days last week with pneumonia in her right middle and lower lobes.  She was treated with steroids, antibiotics, breathing treatments, and oxygen, and as a matter of fact, she even came home on the oxygen.  She is still recovering from that.  At the same time she was in the hospital, my 11 month old son (who was a preemie born at 6 months) was also hospitalized in a hospital 50 miles away from the one my daughter was in.  He has RSV.  My other two children also have been fighting nasty colds.  My eight year old asthmatic son is on antibiotics for a sinus and ear infection.  All four kids are taking turns with our two nebulizers.  As for me, I am fine unless you count the food poisoning I got Sunday that has left me with tummy issues all week.  Hubby is too mean to get sick!  Seems like everyone is improving though, so I would not dare complain.  Still, I can't wait for summer!!!    Hope you feel better!|`|fXj2kVpPaa	Thanks for asking.  My husband had a bad ear infection - took antibotics, but still can't hear very well.    I have bronchitis and chest pain - no cough; I am on inhalers, steriods and antibotics.  I NEVER get this sort of an illness.   It is usually sinus-related.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I got SSA in 1995, so I don't know how long it takes nowadays.  It depends on the state.  I am on disability for bipolar disorder, which is chronic & doesn't repsond to meds.  A lot of people are disabled by the meds themselves, so make sure you list side effects in your info. Below is an essay I wrote up on this topic:    You should contact your county social services offices & see what help may be available. In the meantime, if you desperately need money to live, I know in my area, a guy needed SSI, & a local church plus general welfare helped pay his bills until the social workers could get his SSI paperwork thru. He had schizophrenia, I think. The mental health problem has to be very severe, or if you have another condition like low vision or hearing loss, the two disabilities together may be very severe. You have to be unable to work at ANY job where you could earn about $800 a month or more. So if you can flip burgers, or bag groceries, you don't qualify. Some states have a program you pay into while you work that will pay for short term disability . I know California had that kind of program. I am pretty sure that Massachusetts does too. You can look at pay stubs & see if there is some state plan you have been paying into. Your employer may have been offering short term & long term disability. Long term disability covers mental illnesses only 2 years, usually (discrimination) but that will get you over to SSI/SSA.    Get the book "Social Security Disability" from Nolo Press, at nolo.com, and read their online information, or see if you can get the book at your library (maybe even through an interlibrary loan?) It will give you a lot of background on how to apply, what criteria are used, & how to fill out the forms.     You have to be PROFOUNDLY disabled to get disability, & if you are relatively young & educated, it will be harder. But if you really can't hold down a job (e.g. You can't handle the stress of even showing up to work, you can't behave appropriately much of the time, etc.), & you can document that somehow, you should get it eventually. You will almost certainly be rejected the first time, & the process takes awhile, so somehow you have to manage your finances in the meantime.  You may need to hire a lawyer.    Once you go on disability, you will never get off of it, no one does. You will be in poverty the rest of your life unless you marry out of it or a miracle cures you. The ways the rules are make you dependent on the system, so keep that in mind when you are deciding if you want to do this. A lot of people have no choice, because they can't work at all, or they can't keep a job with insurance to get their pills. It's humiliating in America to have no job-people always ask when you are being introduced,"Oh hello, what do YOU do for a living?" which ends up being a very nosy question without meaning to. Especially since many people do not consider a mental illness to be a bona fide illness. They may think you are a malingerer.  If you can get supportive help from social services (in my state, they will pay for support groups & a social worker to visit & help with paperwork) or tweak your meds some more, or from a local consumer group (google the words consumer, mental, & your state. Consumer=person getting mental health services) then maybe you won't have to go on disability.    I'm on SSA myself, & need the Medicare, so I'm not being judgmental, I just want you to know what you're getting into. For me, there was no other way. I know a lot of people in the same boat. Get the book I recommended, it will give you all the legal & inside information to see if you qualify.    All the best to you! I hope you feel better soon!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	There's  a minimum wait of six months, if you are approved the first time you apply. If you are denied you can appeal. If you are still denied your last option is to appear before the judge and plead your case, most people hire a lawyer specializing in these cases to appear in court with you. After that I don't know   if you can start the  whole process over.  You begin the process by going to your local Social Security office, you have to do it in person. They will give you a form to complete, get a list of all the doctors you have seen that can verify your conditions. Also include any outpatient care or counseling. A lot depends on the form they give you to complete, read and answer the questions as fully as you can. Don't try to make it  brief. Describe in detail how your condition affects you, that will be one of the questions. What I just described was my friends  experiences.  I was approved on the first try but my disability wasn't  bi-polar or any other type of mental condition.  I don't know if that matters in the approval process or not.|`|ycr6iVRraa	I was granted approval for the Disability Support Pension in Australia mid last year. Firstly it took about a year to get the courage to apply then about two and a half months for the paper work to process. The Centrelink info line told me that DSP it the longest payment application to process and approve.    I initially applied for Sickness Benefits because of recent psychotic episodes and hospitalisations that forced me to take a break from study. Sickness Benefits is basically 'the dole' with medical notes that cover you for three months so you don't have to look for work. You can get keep submitting medical notes from your doctor as long as they see fit...So its usually a short term option.     When I applied they felt my circumstances where long term and serve so I was invited to apply for DSP. This process involved being interviewed by a government psychologist for a 'fit to work' assessment. They basically see if you are well enough to work and if so how many hours a week.     My doctor had to fill out a report on my condition and diagnosis, plus I need this verified by another doctor as well. I can tell you that just having a diagnosis of bipolar or schizophrenia or depression or bpd or etc is only a part of it. Also they don't work on bias on which mental disorder you have...its down too severity and individual circumstance.     They assess your eligibility on a points system (I think its up to 20 point..) Each question covers:     Have you been fully diagnosed with your condition and has it been stabilised?   Is this a long term condition?   Are you committed to treatment of this condition (medication, therapy)?   Is this condition periodic/short term/long term/ fluctuating/etc..?   Is your condition likely to get better/ worse/fluctuate/unsure within two years?   Do you feel you can work within two years?     There are also questions about your symptoms, economics, social supports, other health conditions. These are assessed on a scale how Mild/Moderate/Serve they are.    I was processed with little problem and Centrelink were very helpful. On the other hand my mum applied and was rejected the first time (which is surprising because she is very very sick). She has PTSD, depression and a list of other serious medical probs. She contested their decision and reapplied, which you can do. This time she was successful.     Just to let you know in Australia as of mid 2009 they are excepting less DSP approvals...plus there are changes being made to eligibility of sickness payment. This info was given to me by a Centrelink support worker.     Hope this covers it :-) you can email me if you have other questions about applying for DSP.
T16Zmtc3aa	Those are called PVC's.  It happens to most people at some point in time.  It could mean that you have had too much caffeine, exercise, or anxiety.  Unless it happens frequently, it should be nothing to worry about.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Something or nothing. Lots of women have some irregularity. Some have innocent murmurs. Not an issue. Others can have palpitations that have other causes. Doctors need to determine this.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	We all have the odd premature ventricular contractions (PVC's) here and there- they are generally a benign variation of normal. Only rarely do they represent pathology. If they are experienced with any other symptoms then you should see your Dr- A holter monitor study and blood work will exclude most abnormalities.    Stress and caffeine can make the problem worse.|`|8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	It could be an imbalance of your electrolyte levels, the minerals in your body that keep everything functioning normal.    In particular I'm referring to your potassium levels which can cause irregular heartbeats and can be dangerous enough to stop the heart from beating. Potassium levels need to be kept within certain levels and is normally done so by the kidneys. The levels that can effect your heartbeat can be either high or low, a simple comprehensive metabolic blood test can determine if this is the case.|`|Zwpagpubaa	It depends on what you mean by irregular.  Do they speed up or slow down?  What is your bpm when this happens?
WXExyAlWaa	If you don't have any history of anxiety problems I think this is a reaction to the crap you're dumping into your system, particularly all the caffeine.|`|BY02DhfWaa	it sounds a lot like you need sleep and a healthy meal not fast food it could be something missing in your diet you should try to get a good 5hrs of sleep  1 then get something in your stomach .if that does not help get checked by your doc.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Normally, I would show you some of the treatments for panic/anxiety attacks, but you can find them in section 8, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris See: PANIC: COMPREHENSIVE POST first. Caffeine triggers panic attacks, and exacerbates anxiety; both Mountain Dew, and Mocha contain it; see the list on the first page of section 7. Your diet is very poor, and you are very probably lacking in minerals, and vitamins (get a blood test!). Deficiencies in them cause anxiety. A healthy diet consists of: 5 serves of vegetables, daily, including a leafy green one, such as broccoli, spinach, cabbage, kale, or silverbeet/swiss chard, and a yellow/orange one, like yams, (sweet potato) carrots, or pumpkin/squash.     One of the other serves should be legumes, such as beans, peas, or lentils. A serve is 2 heaped tablespoonsful, or half a cup (125 ml). Also, at least 2, to a maximum of 5 serves of fruit: one should be orange, or grapefruit, for the NATURAL vitamin C, and bananas are high in potassium. In addition, your body needs at least 2 teaspoonsful of oil. Olive oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or macadamia oil, are the healthiest, but you can get some in the form of Omega 3 fish oil (certified free of mercury); it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice.       If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it.. Also a serve of protein: meat, fish, poultry, or eggs. For calcium, some yog(h)urt, and/or cheese and/or milk, or tinned sardines, with bones. To the above, add a certain amount of wholegrain products, such as brown rice, seed and nutloaf, or sourdough rye bread, according to your body's energy needs. I suggest that you go to the searchbar at http://www.mercola.com Enter: "nutritional type", and eat more in accordance with yours.    To reduce blood pressure, exercise moderately, daily, for 30 mns. Minimise salt consumption; make a mixture of 1 part iodised salt, to 3, or preferably 4 parts of potassium chloride salt substitute (supermarket,* or health food store salt aisles). Use more hot 'n' spicy, or curries. The sugar overload is also contributing to your problems. Use fruit sugar, from* their sweetener range, (cheaper) or preferably xylitol, or stevia. Fast food once weekly; max! Avoid artificial sweeteners!|`|EFStuco9aa	Mabey you are just stressed out and not eating healthy?|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Too - Much - Caffeine. STOP using caffeine, yes it did cause an anxiety attack. A friend of mine almost lost his mind using caffeine because he has a sensitivity to it. Apparently you do as well. Plus - eat something every few hours to keep your blood sugar stable. There's no excuse for not doing so, carry those little bags of nuts with you or crackers etc. granola bars, something healthy.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	cereal = sugar;  mountain dew = sugar + extreme caffeine  16oz. mocha  = sugar + extreme caffeine  --------------------------------------...  + no sleep & poor nutrition  --------------------------------------...  = extreme stress on the body    The caffeine alone will cause the jitters.  You need to take care of yourself. That's the majority of the problem. You are going to create a time bomb, in your system, if you do not change your habits. Get off of caffeine and sugar for a few days and eat nutritious foods. If you are not better then, see a doctor.  We are all rooting for you!|`|RxQy7gmEaa	Well first of all there isnt alot of nutrients at all in fast food...just preservatives, you will get nothing from eating junk food.  It could depend on your diet, if you are usually a regular eater then messing with that routine can make you feel funny almost sick...  It sounds like your body is telling you something that it needs so maybe you should get a blood test from the doctors to see what levels are low.  Anxiety attacks occurs when something is overwhelming like a large city with millions of people...i actually suffer anxiety and it does not sound like you have bad anxiety, however you have probably worked yourself up alittle and had some side effects.  Try not to worry too much and get yourself to a doctor and eat well!  Hope i have helped.|`|RUKh37e9aa	This doesn't sound like an anxiety problem. I've had anxiety since i was a little kid and if i have an anxiety attack it usually has to do with hyperventilating, crying, and/or feeling depressed. It makes you feel helpless and alone, so i don't think so. You story sounds more like a physical health issue not a mental one.
Lckon4W0aa	Usually the symptoms for diabetes appear rather gradually. If your mom was a type 2, It definitely wouldn't hurt to get checked out. Some of the symptoms of diabetes are also the symptoms of simple dehydration or a urinary tract infection. You can definitely develop type 2 without being overweight. I'm a 20 year old type 2 that was diagnosed even after being extremely fit (i was running track at the time) and not overweight. I also have a family history. If you're worried, definitely ask for the test! Or do it yourself at home. Grab a glucose meter,and check your random, fasting, or after meals level. If they're higher than 140, 105, or 120 respectively, get yourself checked! It's just a simple needle stick that can spare your kideys, eyes, and other organs later!|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	Get checked as soon as you can.When it runs in the family as it does mine you are prone to get it.My mother and her mother had tp 2 and so do I,plus my nephew has tp 1 and my cousin has tp 2.we are all on the same side of the family.|`|Knz8iJSWaa	diabetes can occur by hereditary,even if you have proper diet,exercise,etc there is a possibilty for getting diabetes,since your mom have it, it is better if you go for chekup|`|bIaywrBCaa	sometimes diabetes and high blood pressure just run in the family and not just based on your weight and activity level.

1nIeHzofaa	Concentrate on your BMI.  This is the best indicator of how much fat your losing.  First, dieting for 3 weeks with "cheat days" won't help you.  You must change your eating lifestyle for good.  Stick to low fat foods with almost no saturated fat, whole grains, a lot of fruits and vegetables, low fat protein (fish, soy, yogurt, beans) and replace butter and mayo with olive oil.  Never eat fried or fast food.  Read the nutrition labels on everything you eat.  When you eat make sure it has some nutritional value (snack on almonds, not chips).  Combine this with an exercise routine and you will see results.  Once your body adjusts to the low fat intake you will will never go back.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Same way as you get rid of any other fat.  Eat less, exercise more.    Fat is just stored fuel.  If you take in less fuel than you need, your body turns to stored fat to make up the difference.  It comes off more or less evenly from all over.  You don't get to pick which fat gets used first.|`|xItSR9Z7aa	I have the same problem.  Fat just seems to gather in my thighs first, and is always the last place I lose it.

AscBWmTmaa	Your skin is made from 2 layers of "dead" cells and then a layer or more of live skin cells underneath.  Those living skin cells are protected mostly by the dead layer.  So the molecules from creams and lotions can diffuse slowly through the layers because the layers are made of Cell membranes (dry- in the "dead" layer, live cell membranes in the living layer.)    Most of the cream is actually water and it just evaporates and dries on the skin surface.  But some (the oils and solids dissolved in the cream- Vitamins, etc.)  molecules will diffuse down.      As for Nail Polish, your nails arent made from Dead skin, but Keratin, which is a dry protein.  So less molecules will diffuse down though the Keratin fingernails.  You are more likely to get Nail polish inside you from breathing in the fumes (Acetone, formadehyde or something) which are volatile compounds.      So yes some of the molecules of things on you may get into your skin membranes, then possibly into your blood which would probably be filtered by liver and/or Kidney and then excreted when you pee.
8gWNbFqWaa	someone likes blowjobs doesnt she|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Hoboken.|`|AA12318686	some things do get absorbed into the skin and do eventually enter the blood. You have to reapply topical creams for the same reason you have to take some medicines by mouth more than once a day. they only work in the body for a certain amt. of time, and the body uses it and then gets rid of it. That prevents toxicity. Also, don't worry if you wear green eye makeup, your blood is not going to turn green.

Most places will let you tape it inside of the machine so that you can look at something familiar, soothing and comforting during the test.

NWa45ZDIaa	I'm so sorry. Yes these are symptoms of FMS as well as other similar Auto-Immune diseases. Tests won't show these unfortunately. I added a link below of Dr. St. Amand's Website. He seems to be the best available Doctor who treats FMS, he himself has it. He's amazing! I've had FMS for 18 years & have seen countless doctors & Med Professionals, & oh the tests.... they're endless. I've had many diagnoses of FMS & a few other things, no one has been able to really help me though. I'm going to be starting Dr. St. Amands protocol soon. My friend is on it now & is doing quite well. I have another friend whose been on it for a long time & is totally symptom free, there's no cure, but there is treatment for it.    You're definitely not alone. HOpe you feel better soon. Check out the link below for more suggestions & support.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	you are right to be concerned-    many docs slap teh fibro label on anything-even normal pain due to lifestyle or pain from another illness-----its easy fro them--because they don't have to do a blood test to prove it..    Fibro is NOT known for  lumps all over your body  blurred vision  nail breakage    If you have physical lumps-i would start there---these need to be diagnosed--are they cysts, fibrous?, etc    there are benign conditions that cause this    have they done scans of your brain, spine--these lumps could be pressing on your nervous system causing the blurred vision and other symptoms      there is always a small possibility you have fibro and another condition---but you want know until you figure out what else is going on...    docs just don't know how to think--they are taught to memorize in med school-not to think and problem solve-    my optic nerve was damaged when I was 5--it took 20 yeasr and numerosu docs--it was even missed by the top eye specialists in NYC--    until 1 doc put his thinking cap on and within a minute could tell me he could see the optic nerve was dead just by looking in my eye with old fashioned tools--and it was probably fro an injury when I was 5...

uKmNYqGgaa	No - Lexapro doesn't work that way.  What your Mom is experiencing is a "placebo" effect - as they say, it's all in her head.     I've missed a day now and then from taking the Lexapro, and it doesn't affect me - but missing two or more days sure does.  Doubling up on them after skipping a day likely wouldn't be noticeable.     So... You're right, your Mom's not.|`|U9KJNuq6aa	no, anti depressants don't work that way. she needs to take them every day for it to work effectively, and what she's doing right now is probably really messing with her system.  did you know that one of the hardest parts of overcoming depression or any other mental illness is getting the person to take their meds correctly or even at all?|`|qplKpji5aa	Well I was on Lexapro for about 8 months myself and to me, I had to take it a few weeks to feel the full effects, yet my mother claimed to feel something just taking one pill.     Every now and then if she is feeling stressed she will take half a pill and claim it helps her. I am no longer on them and she never took them regularly, but this is my experience with them.|`|RUCrhhWuaa	OK Um no my aunt and grandpa take it and if they don't take it then it Does not mean take two the next day and their docter told them not to take two the nsxt day it's very very bad for you to do that|`|c23b658ab35a3e3b168534baf3d6f942aa	Typically lexapro takes 2-4 weeks to get into your system, but it can take effect faster. Your mom needs to take the medicine on an everday basis to receive the full effect. By her taking the pill every other day its not maintaining a therapeutic level. Also she should not take more that what is prescribed because it gives her more energy. If she needs more energy she needs to start taking B vitamens or even speak to her Dr. about taking vitamen B12 injections..

c23b658ab35a3e3b168534baf3d6f942aa	The flu sometimes can give you Pneumonia as a secondary infection due to your immune system being down. The wheezing is caused by the mucous that is in your lungs caused by the infection not allowing air to flow freely so air is moving through a small space which is causing the wheezing. The way to help that is to get into a hot steaming shower and breath in the steam which can help open up your airways and then take some deep breaths and cough to get that mucous up. If this does not help then you can get mucinex over the counter which helps break up the mucous so you can get it out. make sure to keep your head elevated up at least 30 -45 degrees to allow your lungs to expand and get air in and out. If this persists I would make and appointment to see your DR.|`|oojO4WAraa	It is mucus in your lungs making this noise.  Drink lots of water to thin the mucus so you can cough it out easier.  You could go to the store and get some expectorant cough medicine to help clear your lungs also.|`|AA10352420	The wheezing is due to mucous blocking the smaller air ways called bronchioles Either you can take steam inhalations/ broncho dilators to ease the mucous and  bring out the sputum easily. You also may need some antibiotics to help reduce the chance of secondary infection.Stop smoking if you are a smoker.Taking more fluids can some times be a problem if you have any abnormal kidney  function/heart failure/etc Check with doctor

Lb5u2aJqaa	It's possible but extremely hard to do!|`|TKNPveHDaa	You are right that 3500 calories is one pound.  It IS possible to burn that much in a day, but you have to walk/jog about 35 miles or do an equivilant activity.  Don't try to lose a pound a day, go for two pounds a week.  Make small changes in your diet and your exercise routine and you'll see more success then if you starve yourself and work super hard.  After a week of that, your body falls apart and you'll go back to the old ways.    Slow and steady wins the race.

Q3xhERA5aa	Some strokes are very mild and some are very serious.  It is a good sign that they are sending him to rehab.  That means they will be trying to work with him on getting better.  So, there is hope.  They will get his diabetes stable and he should be getting a bit better every day. Just keep seeing him if you can and talk with him.  Even if you think he cannot hear you, he can.  So, visit him and tell him who you are and that you are there for him.  Comfort  your parents, this must be difficult for them.  You sound like a good grandchild.  He needs some stimulation.  A radio, music, conversation.  You can help with this.   Good luck.|`|AA12134591	Every case is different ... and, knowing how things will turn out is kinda foggy for anyone... even those that have quite a bit of experience in dealing with such things.  But, my father, who is now 97, had a stroke in August of 2007.  I was at hand when this occurred and was able to get him to the hospital in really rapid time....  He spent some six days in the hospital...then close to three weeks in a rehab hospital... before being allowed to come home...  It was a real struggle for him and took quite a bit of time for him to get back on his feet and going again....  But, besides being considerably weakened by this (he now has to have a walker to get around...spends far less time up and around on a daily basis ...and is noticeably less able to expend much energy at any given time....) ... he is quite able mentally and is still into life and living...  So...depending on the damage done BY the stroke... and the abilities that he has in fighting back from the hit.... he could find his way back to a fairly reasonable life in spite of all of this....    So, keep faith... and hope... and keep him encouraged to fight back against this thing that has happened.... for it WILL take some genuine effort on his part to rehab and get back to the place where he can put a major chunk of this behind him !!

Rather than second guessing and asking people on here I would go to the doctors, there is a simple test to decide. If you are lactose intolerant there a lot of foods you will have to cut out, as a surprising range of foods contain dairy products, therefore I would suggest seeing your doctor rather than listening to someone on here who tells you have and you just giving up milk, especially as you are still growing and need calcium.

If you don;t have access to a weight room then you need to include plyometric activities at the track.  Get on the field and complete 3, 4, 5, and 6 standing broad jumps in a row.

Because when you're about to have sex the walls of vagina naturally loosen up to allow entrance to the penis.|`|AA12198724	either you are reaching your gspot or thats your body's way of telling you to keep your fingers out of there, your vagina has not fully developed.|`|1FqWhSMXaa	im a guy so really dont know, but i think that wil change after sex|`|n8nhjmfraa	uhmm idk about the fingering part but it's small cuz you're still a virgin when you first have sex it's gonna hurt because it will be your first time but after the first few times it will be fine.|`|X1z4WMRsaa	dont worry about it. the feeling inside is just the wall.     as for only one finger: when you are a virgin your have a layer of skin covering the entering of the vagina called the hymen. some girls have a small hole in it others dont. when you have sex it will simple break, maybe unpleasant at first but only happens once. its also referred to as popping a cherry but anatomically the skin is just broke this part wont stretch and this is technically what doctors look for if your a virgin. so just hold off and when you do have sex you'll be able to have more fingers i guess you could say
T16Zmtc3aa	It sounds like you have GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease).  This means that the contents of your stomach are flowing back into your esophagus causing inflammation and irritation.  The med (Protonix) decreases the acid created in your stomach and decreases the acid reflux into your esophagus.  Unless you are pregnant the med is safe to take.    You most likely don't have an ulcer because your stomach is upset with milk.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	It's can be both, you need to ask about the surgery that you can have for acid reflux! I got acid reflux very bad and going to soon get the surgery done and thay do run tests on you to see if you got acid reflux because thay go down your troat with a light and check your stomach but it's not bad at all because I have the light down my troat two times already but it was not bad at all and thay did not put me to sleep the first time for it but the second time thay did put me to sleep so be sure to ask about the surgery because the doctor told me that pills for acid reflux just keep the acid down and the only way to get the acid reflux is by surgery!|`|CCfMrf8Vaa	My MD gave me Protonix for GERDS and it worked wonderfully!!! My health ins changed at work and the copay for Protonix went to $75 a pop. I'm unable to pay that every month, so I did my research and found that OTC Prilosec does the same exact thing for less. After a while of changing my diet, I'm no longer taking the RX.    Go to http://www.webmd.com and there you should be able to do a little more research for your symptoms and RX.|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	Protonix won't kill you if you don't really have reflux.  Sounds to me like you have a mix of reflux and some food allergies.  Milk is a base and wouldn't upset your stomach if you have GERD (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease).  That sounds more like lactose intolerance.      Acidic products, burning, gaseous outbursts, etc. all tend to fit the profile.  I have suffered from GERD for many years and currently take Protonix.  It works great for me and has reduced my symptoms to a great extent.  Keep in mind that dietary choices play a large role in the progression of the condition as well.  Avoid really rich foods, foods with a lot of spice (can be tough if you love Mexican or Indian food), and alcohol.  Caffeine should be limited, but is manageable.      Do you have a hard time eating ruffage (salad)?  Do you often have a hard time swallowing especially course or dense foods?  Do you feel like food gets stuck or impeded on the way down?  These are also symptoms of GERD.  Try the Protonix, and take this seriously.  Untreated reflux can result in esophageal strictures (which make life uncomfortable), and eventually perforations (which can be fatal) if left untreated.
yeG5DZRAaa	Hello Tess;  It does sound like shes smoking pot during the day. I've smoked plenty of weed during my life as I grew up a teenager in the late '70's. The nap and munchies are tell tale signs. But the unicorn haluciation is not pot related. I've smoked canabis from Hawaii, Northern California, Tie stick and Hydrophonic and one hit was enough. But I have never had halucinations from it. LSD will give you these types of visuals as it tends to distort shapes walls floors faces etc. I triped once in College and that was enough. My sister had a serious drug problem at your D.I.L.'s age and barely was able to finish high school. Pot is not as bad a drug as it is commonly made out to be. It is not addictive but it does cause short term memory loss (while you are doing it and a while after) and lathargic behavior when you are comming off it. The really bad drugs are: Heroine, Cacain, Crystal Meth, Speed and LSD if its a bad batch. Heroine and Crystal Meth will age a person fast, particularly Methamphetamines; very dangerous. All of these are manufactured drugs that can have the potential to be killers. As the others have answered, Pot is the least of your worries. If she is doing hard drugs and shooting with needles, check her arms and under finger nails for needle marks. Heroine and crystal meth are way more popular and available that people know and those are the real bad ones. Both are highly addictive (cociane too). I don't believe LSD is addictive.     I would definately do random searches of her stuff. Also, see if her school has a drug councellor. Discuss the problem with them as soon as possible and ask for advice on how to confront her. Ask if they know whats going around school etc.|`|QFm3zcFzaa	yeah she was probably high, but what i dont understand is why parents are making such a big deal about weed. yes i understand you dont want her to do drugs but consider yourself lucky, most kids at my school do way more hard core stuff then that, pot is made from a plant, which comes from the ground...thats way better then her taking some drug that has harmful chemicals in it like bleach. just make sure she doesnt do anything more hardcore. coming from a teen i say loosen the reins a little more, all you are doing is making her want to rebel more. thats just what i think, dont parent her like that if you dont want to.|`|X36cVh4faa	In my opinion, she was probably stoned.   The munchies, loud and obnoxious behavior, strange hallucinations, yeah. she was high.  Get her tested, and intervene.   Save her while you can.|`|RkA8KBXnaa	her friends r sucking her into it. next time u see her check if her eyes r red. but f shes not home u should go in her room and c if shes has any on her so u can take it away...        Good Luck
5oNwMqMiaa	Hi Stacey,  Don't worry - you did the right thing, it's best to rest when you're injured, or you can do more damage!  Wear a support and take it easy when you go tomorrow - or try swimming if your gym has a pool.  As you've already committed to working out, you will have been burning more calories whilst resting anyway, because you're developing leaner muscle.  Just keep on with your healthy eating and you'll keep on track.  Most importantly don't stress about it, that can make it worse because it makes bodies release a hormone called cortisol, which unfortunately makes us store fat - particularly around the middle.  Take care :-)|`|945gMsSZaa	No it won't.      If you sprained your knee then you did the sensible thing.  There is no point training your body to look better if you are damaging it beyond repair by ignoring sprains and strains.    Be careful when you go back not to ignore your knee.  Gentle training will help build up its stabilisation.

8rRmOXvyaa	i has taht pwoblemsz too! xD    i've been asking a couple of questions about that i was worrying about the whole thing    im getting a sclerotherapy. i have a friend she say it works. hers took only 1 session because the vein was just starting to appear and isnt bulging    she said you must undergo a sclerotherapy before the vein is not worse so that it would only take a few sessions like 1 to two sessions(it would be more cheap)    laser/surgery are for veins that are really worse. but if you had worse veins and chose to get a sclerotherapy it might reach to 6 sessions    if your planning to get a treatment. be sure that you're going to go to the right person.
WXExyAlWaa	I would definitely talk to your doctor about it. I know I have no sex drive on medication (and very low without, so it's not really that much of a difference...) and coming off medication can cause side effects in the same way that going on does. It might be something that will fade away, but your doctor should have a better idea what's going on.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Try meditation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O20l3E9ma...|`|InI33juraa	its possible sweetie! Check with your doctor about possible side effects! Good Luck!|`|bnJPvsVWaa	I have heard that, when one stops taking certain medications, their sex drive will return 'with a vengeance.'   I don't know if it's really higher than normal, of if it's been so low, while they were on the med, that it just seems higher.    From what I'm told, it will level off to a comfortable point again.    Until then, you were blessed with two  hands. Put 'em to use frequently to keep yourself level, so you can work.  That's a heck of a lot safer than running around so keyed up that you lack good judgment and wind up with an std or a kid or something.
Dx6dsQx1aa	Do you mean a diabetes educator?  Here is a site where you can find some in your area:    http://www.diabeteseducator.org/Diabetes...|`|Ca0DGDThaa	Try getting in touch witht he  childrens hospital of MI in detroit.  If they dont have one there or if thats too far for you to travel to, they could probably give you a referral to someone closer to you.
CF4wfTYNaa	why don't you just make an appointment with the gynecologist?  that's what I did. my doctor told me that she would like me to see the gyn so that i could talk about birth control with them and get checked up.  I take the prescription to the pharmacy myself and just pay the co-pay. (with my mother's health plan it's $20.)  If your grown enough to have sex you need to be able to take the necessary steps to protect yourself .   the gynecologist will not tell your parents u don't even need to go with them to see her.  If you have insurance go to the gyn|`|0b9cf3568acf2a76265a0b5b41ead92faa	At my PPH they are $25, they can be covered by health insurance if you have it.    I'm not sure if they require parental notice or not. Yes, you can take pain killers. You might feel nauseous and head-ache for the first week or so. If that continues, call the doc back and she might change the type of pills your on.     Good luck!|`|K2rSr7eoaa	I don't recommend birth control pills - they can really mess you up, they come with a lot negative side effect risks when I tryed to use them I got blessed with a few the scariest was the effect they had on my heart. If this is really what you wanna do I believe mine were about 20 bux from planned parenthood. also unwanted pregnancy is not the only thing you have to worry about make sure you always use a condom.|`|vNP5nmiTaa	I do not understand some of your question. Ok first off:    Planned Parenthood does things for pretty cheap. I think you can  get the pills free, and the STD testing is based off income, so if you have none, it could be free, or very low cost (I am guessing 20-30 bucks?)    Second, I do not understand what you mean about the pain pills question at all. Can you explain better, then I will answer you.    **EDIT**: I have been on the pill for years, were talking 12 yrs +. I have had ZERO side effects. No nausea, weight gain, and no surprise babies. I had my kids when I wanted them (planned). I take Trivora. If taken every day, and not forgotten, the pill is 99% effective. Yes, you can take Tylenol, and Ibuprofen. It will not harm anything. Just remember, if you ever get ill and get prescribed antibiotics, always use a back up (condoms) for that month because those meds CAN make BC pills not work. Also, I am pretty sure you do not need parental permission to get assistance.
YEd9Q5KZaa	Well there is a very slight chance, but it depends what happened. For example, if you get fingered by a guy and he has c u m on his hands you could get pregnant.|`|ZGcNgRX0aa	if there is an "air strike" in the area yeh its possible. you dont need penetration|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	Hmm..

It also depends on your definition of 'sex'. Basically you can get pregnant if semen (sperm) enters your vagina at the right time of the month- when you are ovulating. Think about lesbian couples and couples undergoing fertility treatment- they don't have to have sex to get pregnant. Just need sperm and an egg and a uterus.|`|zUhYQyUNaa	ask a guy to ejaculate (hehe) in a jar for you and put it in.|`|AA12198724	You answered your own question.

I don't remember the stats but it is higher than most would think.  Basic medical fact:  If the sperm gets into the vagina you may get pregnant.  How likely depends on the timing, the amount of sperm, and the quality of sperm.  Therefore, it is wise to be extra careful when engaging in any sexual type activity including petting, oral, and anal.

7JFz3PKnaa	Satisfying yourself is really hard, but I've been battling my weight for a long time, so I can offer you some tips:    Drink eight glasses of water every day. It's hard, but do as much as you can! If you don't get to eight, that's fine, go up a little each day.    Eat only one whole egg every day.    Try not to use as much salt and butter on things.     Stop drinking soda. I know it sounds hard, but I lost 2-3 pounds just doing that. You'll feel great - less heartburn, less fat!    Switch over to healthy versions of the food you eat. Wheat noodles, wheat or half wheat bread, 2% or skim milk, ground round instead of regular hamburger meat, baked foods instead of fried ones, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray instead of butter, egg whites instead of eggs when you need to make eggy things.    Stay away from salty snacks like potato chips. Instead, eat lots of fruit and veggies, and buy the 100 calorie snack packs at the store instead of big bags of potato chips. Butter-free popcorn is a good snack with a few sprays of butter, and in the summer, watermelon is great as long as you leave off the salt.     When you eat, eat very slowly, and wait ten minutes before going to get seconds to be sure you need them.    Work out at least thirty minutes every day. If you're not breathing really hard and if your blood isn't pumping, it doesn't count.    Walk as much as you can - if your school or any other place you go to often is nearby, bike. Biking is a great workout.    If you have a Wii, buy Wii Fit and Sonic/Mario Olympic Games.    If you're DDRing, put it on Workout Mode so you don't fail and can dance as long as the song goes. Challenge yourself! Do harder songs that make you really work.    Lastly, only weigh in the morning after you pee - no other time.     Good luck!|`|Lrrw5xEGaa	Ok, here's what you do.  1. Figure out some tasty foods that you really like that are also very good for you, such as: Carrots, cucumbers, whole grain breads, eggs, salads, fruits, light yogurts, granola bars, non-sugary cereals, lean meats, grilled chicken, baked potatoes, and that's just a few, there are plenty more.  2. Only allow yourself to eat when its meal time, or your if stomach is actually growling, don't eat when you're bored. If you're THINK you're about to get hungry, try drinking some water. If you're still hungry, get yourself a small snack consisting of ONLY fruits and veggies unless it's meal time.  3. Exercise. If you can''t get out to a gym, play DDR, go outside and kick a ball, grab your iPod and jog around the block, whatever. Just get active. Exercise daily and try to get to a gym as much as possible.  4. Find out what makes you gain/lose weight. Make a chart for the week. Weigh yourself daily and write down your weight and exactly what you ate that day. (ALWAYS weigh yourself before you've eaten anything, and after you've already gone to the bathroom.) At the end of the week, see what you ate when you gained and what you ate when you lost. (e.g. Monday: 150 lb. Food: Carrots. Tuesday: 147 lb. Food: Pizza. Wednesday: 156 lb. Food: Bread, etc.) This will help you decide what foods to eat, and what foods to stay away from.    Hope I helped :)|`|vrGjDDmzaa	toning= pushups, situps, squats, lunges    and eat healthily. dont pay attention to "calories' pay attention to fat and sugar. also, try to eat food in it's least processed state. if you eat something with a hundred ingrediants then you dont know whats in it, do you?    also replace meat with vegitarean alternatives, like Moriningstar.    also drink water B4 eating    and KEEP MOVING!!!

Sure they have celebrities endorsing things, but for all we know they could be reading a script.  And of course manufacturers will say their product will work; they want to sell them!!  My guess is that you should look at everything skeptically and do a bit of research.  Google it, ask a physician, or a family member who has tried something similar.

It's probably your body just dealing with stress in your life. Have you started a new pill? That could also be the reason.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	Yes and no. The blood flow could indicate a miscarriage, but the fact that you mention no pain makes me think it's not. Either way you should go to a hospital immediately.|`|NTqDEeShaa	if you don't have the period your are pregnant  do yourself a favor and get a test

Good luck.|`|X36cVh4faa	If you had a miscarriage, it wouldn't be brown, it would be bright red, and a lot of blood. It was probably just some left over blood that didn't make it out last time. nothing to be worried about.|`|mS23eOAjaa	possible miscarriage  in a miscarriage, there is usually no pain or cramping, which distinguishes it from a period  definatly sounds like a miscarriage to me, but you should talk to your doctor|`|ff56RcYVaa	I hope to god it was a miscarriage, I would hate to see what your children would look like.|`|x42Hz54taa	highly doubtful  you wouldnt have a miscarriage right away  and you would definitely notice symptoms of pregnancy right away like hungrier and bloated and throwing up    periods can be different every time. i have definitely had "old blood" looking ones|`|GKINbVhsaa	my periods get like that sometimes. I think it has something to do with your current diet or water intake. I wouldn't worry about it. blood clots are normal.|`|f3265e6e564af0f5d6c3c04f02637cfeaa	Its really hard to tell. But here are some symptoms of a miscarriage:  -Vaginal bleeding that may be preceded by a brownish discharge   -Cramps in the pelvic area   -Tissue or blood clots passing from the vagina   -A decrease in the usual signs of early pregnancy, such as nausea and breast tenderness   -Pain in the lower back or abdomen|`|6db9945ff407961b87dcdc1c2327d1dbaa	It's possible.  I think for this you have to go to the gyne, it's something only she could talk to you about.
9zqaBGtgaa	First of all, you should be asking your gyno about this.  Although, you could just be spotting (which isn't uncommon).  I think you would have stomach cramps at the least if you miscarried.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Go to the doctor. It would be too soon for you to be pregnant and miscarrying, unless you were pregnant when you had your period which sometimes does happen. Go see the doc!|`|db7c12ce76ff7d75c1b0331c96a016afaa	Smart people say: go see a smarter person. eg, a doctor.

7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	What you need is an inhaler.  An albuterol inhaler so you can cough the stuff out easier.  In addition, you might want to use some kind of expectorant like Robitussin plain.  And drink a little more water than you usually do.  It helps thin the secretions so they can come out better. If you get fever then you might need the doctor.  WAIT, you will need to go to the doctor to get the albuterol inhaler anyway.  So go, it even helps with the nasal congestion in my opinion.      Obviously you have bronchitis and bronchitis can be either viral or bacterial and both can be healed by your own body.  But sometimes doctors will prescribe antibiotics, but just go and get your inhaler antibiotics or not.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	You have the flu- it will run it's course in  a week to 10 days.

If depends if you have a fever or not.  Esp. it it has lasted two weeks long.  The lump in your throat could be an imflamation of a baterial infection and you need to be put on anti bacterials.  If left untreated, the "lump" will get worse and you will have trouble swallowing foods and liquids.  Go see a doctor within the week unless the symptons get increasingly worse, go to the E.R.    -IT IS NOT THE FLU, THE SYMTONS WOULD HAVE LESSENED BY NOW.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	you need some strong antibiotics!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Try mucinex or get the doctor to prescribe you something to help you cough it up.

j70hSD8Kaa	I've had these before so, I seeked help from a counselor. They are called "Intrusive Thoughts". They are actually very common, just most people do not talk about it. I thought I was going crazy when I had them, but really.. it's nothing to be too worried about.. many people get them! I know they are disturbing and scary, so if they are upsetting you immensely try seeking professional help :)  hope this helped some!|`|fi7Aq9cWaa	Get more sleep.|`|ub6641d2aa	No one knows for sure except for a trained professional. Talk to your doctor and see what he thinks.|`|J2iJL7sVaa	well if they're disturbing thoughts about just about anything, you could have some form of OCD. Obsessive compulsive disorder. It's where you get disturbing thoughts that repeat in your mind over and over sometimes those thoughts come with compulsions which are things you feel like you have to do in order to get the thoughts to go away or to keep something bad from happening you feel like. No the thoughts aren't real. Try to go to a doctor if that's possible.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Not to worry.|`|oUd9ZIDLaa	First you need to re-trace your steps and think about the last thing  you were doing before this happened, what ever it was try to not go near it or think about it.  Like if it happened after yu watched a scary movie try to stay away from scary stuff for a awhile.|`|WNTzcc6saa	Sounds like an existential crisis! I get them often enough. Try doing something to remind yourself that everything's real, like running or eating an excellent meal. Don't, you know, beat yourself up or drive off a cliff. I've had those impulses, and they are bad. Then again, they might not just be benign thoughts; you might have some sort of disorder. Maybe talk to a therapist if it keeps bothering you.|`|4d381268b26155be917ffb27731db32eaa	From something you watched on tv?
RXI8ImdIaa	You need to ask the surgeon about this. It depends on the type of incision that was made, in addition to a few other factors. We can't tell you for sure.     But I'm going to bet that 4 days is not enough. You say you need to heal right away - I understand that you are busy and there is stuff that needs to be done. But your body's healing process cannot be hurried up. Try to get help from some friends or family until you are given the OK to go back to your normal activities.    And - call your surgeon's office tomorrow to ask about this :)|`|ENilx3F2aa	well it all depends on u. Your body will let you know when you are doing too much.
ONooURxIaa	A small amount of protein during the workout will limit muscle cell degradation during workouts.  About 5-10 grams would be sufficient.  Accelerade makes a sports beverage with some protein in it.  After workouts, consuming around 20-30 grams of a high quality protein will help in anabolic muscle development.  Blend it with some carbs and it will get to your muscles quicker.  If you want to get big, you generally need to eat about 500 calories more per day than if you were trying to stay the same size.  Most studies show that you can gain about 1-2 pounds per week this way.    As far as type of protein, egg protein is the closest match to what our body is looking for.  Milk/dairy is close.  You can go with a powder, or you can drink about 24-32 ounces of chocolate skim milk.  You will sometimes get more vitamins in some powders, but they can be expensive.  Johns Hopkins University did a study a couple years ago and they found that the chocolate milk and a 20 gram protein drink has about the same effect for gaining muscle.|`|coZ7Fm79aa	no in the morning you should have food my typical breakfast is kashi go lean cereal with milk or 8 eggwhites on toast and milk when i was bulking up id add a banana for more carbs  u should have 1g per lb u weigh if u weigh 120lbs eat 120g protein a day  and eat 22-25x ur bodyweight so if ur 120lbs eat 2600-3000cals to gain weight|`|vkDEE6eqaa	if you are working out...such as lifting weights....and your goal is to lose body fat but gain more muscle, then yes, you should include more protein in your diet....it help repair and help in the development of muscle    it doesn't neccessarily have to be protein shakes and bars.....  chicken  tuna  oatmeal  cottage cheese  milk  eggs  and i think steak???   are all good protein while working out    it is also good to have some protein about 1 1/2-2 hours after working out because your body will naturally burn fat afterwards for that long....    try searching in google for more in depth information|`|nf8WKA3jaa	Id do on or two shakes a day if you want to put on weight. Do one after your workout and then one before you go to bed. Your muscles absorb it best after a workout. And its called breakfast because you "break your fast" so if you go to bed with food in it, you will not be fasting and your body will have calories to burn. You may not see very big gains still though. Im 16 and my matabolism is so high that i honestly cant gain a single pound no matter what i do, you might just have to wait till you get older.|`|pmNYvpUcaa	you should probably drink a shake in the morning and a bar before you work out to build more muscle|`|CgUfb6cCaa	It's not absolutely necessary but it is important.    The one-hour period immediately following exercise is known as the muscle recovery window because muscle recovery proceeds much faster when nutrition is consumed within this window than when it is consumed later. Water is beneficial for rehydration during the muscle recovery window and carbohydrate helps replenish muscle fuel stores, but the protein is the most important post-workout nutrient.  After Excercise    By consistently consuming protein during the muscle recovery window after each workout you will build muscle and gain strength faster. In a study reported in the Journal of Physiology, subjects were given a carbohydrate-protein supplement either immediately after exercise or two hours later while participating in a 12-week strength-training program. The authors reported that when a carbohydrate-protein mixture was given immediately after each exercise session, muscle size increased eight percent and strength improved 15 percent. When the supplement was given two hours later, there was no muscle growth or improvement in strength.    I like a chocolate shake after a workout. I use Designer Whey for that. Google it, they're really good.

9nDhR7xWaa	Hi,    I know this aint what you want to hear but just hear me out.    I have a problem, and the doctor was pratically the LAST place on earth i wanted to go. However, I bit the bullet and went anyway. I ended up with a female doctor which did not help because I wanted a male doctor. I hated getting the tackle out, but in a strange way im REALLY glad that I went, and if anything has probably improved my self confidence significantly, as when I went to the specialist, I had no problem atall.    By sounds of it you either have a rash or an infection, so best thing I would suggest otherwise, is make sure you clean the infected area daily as fully as possible, and make sure you clean it after toilet too.. Hopefully problem will sort itself out , but could be worth biting the bullet and visiting your worst enemy earlier.    P.S. Alot of men are concerned abuot the size of their bits, and confidence can be effected by this - however many dont realise what the average size actually is... 6 1/2 inches for a grown adult.    P.P.S. Discontinue use of the Jelqing... Because men are so sensitive about size, theres a huge market for these products, but in effect NONE of them have been scientifically proven, and do not work. The only real solution is surgery which is dangerous.|`|LoKJBLF1aa	get it over with , dude;go at once to a doctor, preferably a female one.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Bless your heart!

ONooURxIaa	I would suggest doing some squats or lunges.  You need to use your legs more since they are larger muscles.  The bigger the muscle working, the more calories you will burn.  In order to burn enough calories you will need to do a routine at night that looks like this.    10 push ups  20 crunches  20 squats  10 push ups  20 crunches  15 standing lunges on each side.    Repeat that 2-3 times at night and 5-6 nights a week.    If you get your self a few inexpensive dumbbells, you can add more variety to your workout.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Do Isometric Exercises  See wikipedia for results from these exercises and NASA's uses|`|4qh1FkXMaa	running,crunches and sit ups.

bIUIHBOhaa	Pray 2 god its not cancer!!!!|`|b8Mfl9UZaa	I get those sometimes too, it's probably your lymph node which "puff up" when you have an infection and will stay that way for awhile because it's fighting off the infection. Check to see if you have a sore throat or head cold or something (I find that early in the morning when I first wake up is best to check). If it's really big (like a plum) go get it checked immediately. Check WebMD because that mentions something about the lump moving or not moving under the skin. It's nothing to worry about, just white blood cells going to the place of infection to fight it off and takes awhile to go down.|`|kxwWfjFKaa	Hmm... just wait a couple of days and if it doesn't go away or it gets bigger then you should definitely get it checked out. It could be a lymph node, but it could also mean something more serious.|`|S8px5c5paa	it could be a ball of fat  if it grows bigger you should go to a doctor|`|AfqgwmKuaa	it should go soon its nothing serious its just nymph gland that's fighting infections have you had a sore throat, headaches not feeling well? i have one right now in fact i had a sore throat last night and i found it this morning when i was itching my ear don't keep playing with it or anything cus that will make it sore! but if it gets bigger, moves or changes in any way go to the Dr's!

Meaning in rare cases it will cause paralysis while in most it will only cause vomiting/ diarrhea. The most common symptoms of food poisoning are vomiting/diarrhhea/dehydration.

F8tQkDPcaa	There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.  They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.    Check out the reference for the full UNBIASED comparison and review.|`|viHy8mGeaa	I like how you put a smiley face in there|`|iXbRVkPAaa	well i have severe panic attacks  but i have asthma as well  so its veryyyy bad  but i usually get a wet rag  and have my friends tell me its ok  and keep saying it in my head|`|J4xOpvdUaa	when it happens again take a breathe count to 10 and close your eyes and go to your happy place and just try to slow your body down|`|AA11319125	What usually happens when you have a panic attack is a voice in you grows stronger and stronger telling you that something bad is going to happen. Even though your mind and common sense tells you that nothing is wrong. You have to learn how to breathe the right way. Usually, people who get anxiety or panic attacks breathe through their chest instead of their stomach. Practicing breathing through your stomach is a good way to avoid this sudden attacks. You have to overtake that inner voice in you telling you that something bad is going to happen. In other words, you have to control your mind and body to cope well with the attack. Calming down and taking it easy would help. Know that panic attacks are not harmful and life threatening but can only be frightening. Good luck:)

Technically double jointed is called "hypermobility".    I'm double jointed in my elbows.  You're not "deformed".  I know bunches of people who have this exactly the way you have, in their fingers.  From what I understand, it's usually a non-issue in terms of health, but occasionally it can be bad, because it can break more easily than normal straight joints.|`|AA11296458	I know a few people whose fingers bend like that.

9NpXU7D2aa	yes it sounds like you could have a detached retina as the person above me stated.   does the spot in your one eye move around? if so then it is a floater. and usually floaters are nothing to worry about you et them when you look at the sun or when someone takes a picture with the flash on. but when it doesn't go away and especially when you have trauma to the head or have had previous eye conditions a floater can indicate a retinal detachment.  you need to see an ophthalmologist immediately (not an optometrist cuz they don't do surgery)  if it is a detached retina you will need surgery to fix it ASAP cuz if its not treated quickly it can lead to blindness in that eye.   if the floaters suddenly get worse call the dr and ask to be seen sooner and if you can't get in any sooner then go to the ER and ask them to check your retina.   here learn about retinal detachments and get an appointment:  http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/tc/retin...|`|HHUSNn7iaa	I have worked in various optical practices for nearly 10 years and am married (for my sins, lol) to an optician. I don't mean to worry you, but it sounds like you need to get to a doctor asap. You could have a detatched retina. This can be caused by blunt trauma to the eye area, and is something that can be treated relatively easily, with surgery, but it must be caught quickly otherwise it can lead to permanent blindness. Hopefully, it's not this, and you're just a little bit dazed....but it's most certainly best to get it checked out.  Hope this helps....let me know how you get on!

aCx57XXzaa	Tell your dad that you made a big mistake and burned yourself. You probably did something that he warned you not to do but he will understand. Have him look at it.    Minor burns should be watched for any evidence of infection, such as redness, fever, swelling, oozing or increased pain. If you notice that an infection has developed, get medical attention. There may be some pigment changes in the affected area. Most minor burns usually heal on their own without any major complications.  Blisters should not be broken. By breaking blisters, you can cause a greater chance of infection.  Cover the affected area with, aloe vera gel/cream or an antibiotic cream, (non oil based).  If necessary use a non-stick sterile gauze bandage (wrapped loosely) to prevent infection. Good luck!    FOR MORE INFORMATION AND VIDEO GO TO WEBSITE BELOW.|`|VOccyg7daa	Yes it will heal itself you just need to be careful about infections after the blister pops. Unless you did it on purpose you shouldn't be afraid to tell your father. I'm sure he's burnt himself on more than one occasion. I've had many burns, all first and second degree, and have never sought medical care for them. Keep it covered to help prevent infection.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Yes it can heal, but you have to protect the blister so it doesn't open and become infected.  Soaking it in cold water will be soothing.  If the blister opens, have an antibiotic ointment and bandaids on hand to treat it and prevent infections.

I've tried it and it does work sometimes but not always.    It's worth a try though. That or holding your breath and counting to 999 :-) Just kidding.|`|qQRcZkxtaa	If you sit there and wait for the next hiccup and expect it to come it never does if you do it for about a minute they will go! It works for me. I saw on telly a young lad who had had the hiccups for 3 months non stop they stopped suddenly for like a day or two then he got them again and he had them since which was like a year! There was also a old man on there who had the for like 44 years they both tried every trick in the book and never got rid. So if you still have them in few hours I'd worry lol
yE2vM76naa	I can't provide any "success stories" - I cannot think of a more barbaric treatment - for anything - available.    It has been ditched in favor of more humane therapies.  One that is being investigated is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.   Here is a link for it from the National Alliance for Mental Health  http://www.nami.org/Content/ContentGroup...

Think about what mentos is made of...    ...mostly corn syrup, mint flavoring, and sweetener, none of which lowers your sperm count. And the process of melding these ingredients together to make candy has been around for ages.     Most other candy you eat have basically the same ingredients, and none of them have been thought of to lower your sperm count, right? So why worry about what mentos does if it's practically the same as every other candy out there?|`|FNDxZIJWaa	I've never heard that.

If you haven't had sex or messed with IV drugs, then get checked for TB. Anyone can get that if someone with TB coughs on you.

NZoHMFryaa	That is included in your basal metabolism and it varies among individuals.     It depends on how old you are, how fast your natural metabolism is, how active you are, how much muscle you carry, whether you are sick or well, and whether you are a man or woman.    Eating and digesting take some calories and this is partly why it is a good idea to eat 5-6 small meals a day if you are trying to reduce.

I have the same problem, but only a qualified beautician can get rid of it. Sorry! x|`|gTWgbpNFaa	it might be a build up of cholesterol better have your levels checked|`|945gMsSZaa	They are keratin filled cysts called Milia.  Totally harmless but annoying as you are aware they are there.    Apart from making people worry about their appearance, milia aren't harmful and don't need to be treated in any way.    But if you want to get rid of them, the following may help:    Hold a hot, wet face cloth over the skin for a few minutes - the temperature should feel comfortable, not painful. This simple facial sauna helps to loosen and remove dead skin cells and debris from the skin.   Use an exfoliating facial scrub to remove the top layer of skin, which can enable the cysts to fall out. These scrubs are available from the pharmacist and are the kind of facial wash used for treating mild acne. Those containing salicylic acid work well, but always read the label or ask the pharmacist to make sure the one you select is suitable for you.     You may wish to have a consultation with a qualified beautician who'll also be able to recommend possible treatments.     Most importantly, resist the temptation to pick at them. This will hurt, damage and possibly scar the skin, and may introduce a nasty infection.
n926icjvaa	I think the best thing you can do, is write down everything you're thinking before you go to bed, like a diary or journal.

You friend is there and the friend does not cause the things you get into so do not call her name when you get into something or have a question, just ask the question.    Not hearing her is a sign that you are not sad or lonely or crying.  It is not so much by words that she speaks, but by your own actions.  In other words, she is you.  Start thinking of happy thoughts and colorful thoughts and see if she doesn't thank you.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	I wouldn't put it in the mental disorder category. I believe it's just your subconscious  (our inner voice) trying to soothe the part of you that feels empty and lost. It's like our brain's verbal voice that only we can hear because we are, in fact, creating it. Sometimes when I feel lost in my head about, life, circumstance, challenges... which we all do from time to time, we let our heart tell us the right thing that we knew all along.

Good luck!!|`|YurdkgLwaa	The best thing to do is change your lifestyle, not anything to major though, don't call it a ''diet''.  ive recently started to do that.

I think its great your doing it together cus that means you can work out together, which makes it fun.  Have you thought ive getting some dance workout Dvd's, you can do them together 3-5 days a week.

Because those things are basically "death and disgust in a stick". That should be enough to convince you.|`|8SjpwLNSaa	Think what a difference quitting will do to your health - your lungs and heart. You've just drastically reduced you chances of cancer and of dying from other smoking-related diseases for example emphysema. Read up on emphysema if you want to make yourself quit it isn't pleasant.  Also, you'll be saving loads of money which you can save up and buy yourself something to reward yourself for your effort. You'll also save yourself wrinkles and sunken cheeks from inhaling on cigarettes.  Also, before long you'll be able to taste and smell properly again - you'll enjoy food and drink so much more.  If you need some extra help then you could ask a pharmacist for some gum or patches to reduce your cravings. There are also NHS Stop Smoking Groups which you could try. Why not book yourself a place?  I've never smoked but I can try to imagine what you're going through.  I hope this helps and good luck!|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	At the moment, there's a picture of a heart on the screen at the side of your question on my screen. Do you see that?    Now, just imagine it all blackened or if you can't see that, just imagine your lungs which, instead of being healthy, as a smoker would be all tarred and black.    Congratulations on the quitting, hopefully, it's not too late for them. They may recover.    Does that help?|`|vzZE0ktYaa	If you have trouble sticking to it, think about the positive changes you are going through as your body begins to heal itself. The first 72 hours are the most difficult.

VnLaUS3Jaa	smoking in any form is not great for the lungs. we all know that.    if you have alot of ambitions and are goal oriented, i don't recommend smoking weed. it usually makes people immobile and unmotivated.    if you are high strung most of the time and need to relax, it can be beneficial to help you chill the f out.    i don't see anything wrong with it overall. it dosen't offend me. potheads don't bother nobody.
xLj4nilXaa	I think you should put some weight on, depending on your height.  If you find it hard to have breakfast in the morning, then maybe have a smoothie made of a small handful of strawberries, half a sliced banana and 200ml of apple juice?  Then always make sure you eat lunch, even something like soup or a baguette etc.  Your dinner sounds perfectly fine, just remember to have snacks in between meals as if you do not eat enough you could end up with health problems.  Hope I helped! :)|`|9vLJbiHeaa	you should have 3 set meals a day for a healthy diet.  breakfast something quite filling and nutritious maybe porridge, toast and jam or muesli  lunch something light maybe: soup, salad with chicken strips or poached fish (salmon, cod) with potatoes  and for dinner you shoudl eat dinner not too late so it digest but you should also eat something to satisfy you and has protein. someting like spag bol, fajita, stir fry or steak and mash.  this is healthy eating so you wouldnt be adding weight but you should also do regular exercise so you dont look too thin but instead have a toned body.  -x-|`|5HtRcpWqaa	It would be healthier for you to eat small meals during the day.  Try to have at least 4 food groups in your breakfast.   Even if you don't have time to eat a small meal during school, take a couple of small snacks to eat during the day, such as fruit, nuts, crackers, or any other small snacks you have access to.  You may gain weight at first, if you start eating more meals in a day, but in the long run it is better for you.  Keep up with having dinner.  If you're hungry, you should eat.|`|X9GvHQvfaa	I would say no...When i was in high school, i was the same way except i wouldn't eat anything until like 4 or 5 and i lost tons of weight...|`|YK05Itmraa	It sounds to me like you are eating the right things - just not enough of it!!!!    Keep eating the kind of foods that you are - fish, potatoes, salad, fruit but just more regularly.    Try maybe having some porridge in the morning along with your fruit.  Then for lunch try pasta, sandwiches, fruit, snack bars.  And for dinner eat exactly what you are eating.    I am 17 and weigh under 8st and i personally think i look ok although my actual weight scares people.    You dont have to be scared to put on weight as sometimes it goes to place that might need a little bit more like your boobs or bum.    Good Luck|`|uAEVGCu1aa	Especially with you being busy at school you need more fuel during the day. Can you not take a packed lunch to school? Even just a sandwich, some fruit and maybe a snack bar? Not eating all day is really not good for you.     You are not eating enough, your body is starving so it is storing any fat that you eat. I weight as much as you but I eat 4 meals a day!|`|iCzMOXOWaa	you certainly need a bigger brecki than an apple!porridge is good and toast,!as they say brecki like a king,lunch like a prince,and dinner like a pauper|`|RWvPhYgyaa	Firstly you're deffinatly not eating too much.  You should have cereal in the morning, if you have to rush a cereal bar is useful.  If you're too busy at school make time, you must eat. Or you could take packedlunch and therefor eat it when you aren't so busy.  In the evenings you should have a snack aswell as dinner.  You seem to be eating healthy enough but remember your body does need some fat and sugar.    :):) 
UEOldaPZaa	Sometimes the 1st premolars are removed and sometimes the 2nd premolars are removed.  The reasoning of removing these teeth is that there is not enough room in your mouth to accommodate the teeth.  If there is alot of crowding in the front teeth, the first premolars are usually removed.  If there is less crowding, the 2nd premolars are removed.  In any case, the gaps will be completely closed and it will not affect your chewing.  For more info, check out:  http://www.bcdentalcare.ca  Hope this helps.|`|NmqMKHvWaa	I assume you are seeing an Orthodontist for your treatment and a general dentist for the extractions?  In any case, sometimes the jaw structure dictates that the 2nd premolars be extracted rather than the first premolars. Due to genetics, everyone's not treated exactly the same, even in the same family.|`|YHgLiBfIaa	I had my 2nd premolars out because if he takes out the first, when your teeth are straight it will look weired, pulling the 2nd premolars aren't that noticeable.  =D|`|vmSVtI8Zaa	The premolars may need to be removed so as to create space for the other teeth to shift into alignment during braces treatment. If the front teeth are crowding severely, two premolars might need to be removed to have more space.    I think it makes more sense in most cases to remove the first premolars as the braces will then help shift the first 3 front teeth to take it's place, rather than having to shift 4 teeth in each dental arch. However, sometimes premolars with decay is chosen over the other one for removal as it is unhealthy.    Having the brackets and wires can hinder with oral hygiene, please make sure you keep your teeth clean by proper daily brushing and flossing to have good teeth and gums.    All the best! Smile :D

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.
X6aYVpU3aa	the best way to lose the fat on your belly is cycling lying down, do it 100 times, knee bending up to your chest and straight to the air of course when you are lying down, do it 100 times or more if you know you can do already more than 100 times. 250 and 250 is good. I lost my belly with these. And jogging is the best to lose weight, 30minutes per day, trust me.    No slimming pills please, it is just all in your head, if you are decided to do something, meant it, and nothing will be obstacle.

Zwpagpubaa	My daughter also has WPW.  If it were me and my symptoms were as mild as his, I wouldn't mess with the procedure.  It may become more bothersome as he gets older.  I would just wait it out and see if it gets worse.    Does he take Atenolol to keep it at bay or is it always this mild with out the medication?  If he is on medication for it, then I wouldn't want to have to take the medication any longer than I have to.|`|M4RyKomEaa	There are a couple of different types of WPW. One is more benign and may not be a dangerous situation however there is a type that could cause a fatal arrhythmia.  The catheter ablation is a minimally invasive study where catheters are put in the heart via the groin and the abnormal pathway that is causing the WPW is found and then is literally burned so as to inactivate it. (Don't worry it is a microburn to a few isolated cells  and doesn't cause any major damage to the heart)  It is painless and if done in the morning you might be able to go home that night.  An ablation is a complete cure in a straightforward case.  I would discuss it further with your doctor and ask a few more questions as to the risk of leaving the WPW untreated. If it is the benign kind and happens infrequently maybe you could wait.  If the other type obviously you have to do something.   If your husband is already on medicine to suppress any arrhythmias then it seems logical to have  it done as then he could come off those meds forever  once cured.

bb8740cbd7c94be820535e8abb6199fcaa	It's the same price with or without the anesthetic.  The cost varies with different types of restorations.      There are times when anesthetic isn't really necessary, if the decay hasn't gone too far or passed through the enamel.      If you are nervous or anxious about the drilling, then you should probably have the anesthetic placed anyway, the last thing we need is a jumpy patient in the chair.      Have the decay taken care of now while it's small; the discomfort and cost are considerably less when the decay is taken care of quickly before it becomes too large or reaches the pulp requiring a root canal and crown.      You also might want to pick up better oral hygiene habits or flossing and brushing so you can eliminate decay in the future saving your self the anxiety and your parents the money.|`|mXYxRsB5aa	It will hurt if you dont have the area numbed first depending on how deep the cavity is     I'm sorry that your parents will be mad at you for this but you really do need a painkilling injection before having it done, i am not sure if it will cost more, i think it is just one price all included|`|crKCWOxXaa	Everyone is afraid of something at the dentist I myself do not like the drilling either.

I just sat around with no direction.  I felt trapped in my body.    But everyone is different on medicines.  So, I would talk to your dr before stopping your medicine.      Have you tried taking it with food?|`|hmsMpECkaa	Do you know what an SSRI does?  Do you know what SSRI means?   Have you attended physical anatomy classes to give you the knowledge of what causes you to sleep?  Do you know what Serotonin is?  Do you know what Serotonin does? Do you understand how Serotonin is produced in your body?    One medical word is Gastroparesis.  'Paralyzed stomach.'  What is happening is the Serotonin receptors in your stomach are being blocked and and the stomach does not digest Serotonin.  And the Serotonin is making you nauseous.  So, switching from one SSRI to another will not change anything.  It's a funny thing though!  Hitler did extensive research in his prison camps to determine the many different ways to change the body.  Seems to me the doctors could come up with something different, but they haven't!

aiBOMU9kaa	To begin with, you can't order glasses from your contact lens prescription.    There is a 99.9 % chance that your glasses prescription isn't the same as on your contacts box.    Go back to the Dr. where you get your contacts and ask for a copy of your glasses prescription. You will see that the numbers won't be the same as on your contacts boxes.    With Toric lenses like you have, the powers are usually " rounded off " to the closest power available in that brand.     Rounding off works for contacts, but not for glasses.|`|HHUSNn7iaa	Hi, I've been an optical advisor for nearly 10 years and am (for my sins, lol) married to an optician. You cannot order glasses with that prescription for several reasons.  Firstly, your contact lens prescription is different to your glasses prescription because the contact lens is that much closer to your eye, therefore it doesn't need to be as strong as the one you would have for glasses.     Also, contact lenses are not made in every single axis...generally they are available in 090 and 180. Therefore if your glasses prescription calls for an axis of 62 degrees, your optician will simply order the contact lens that is closest to that.  However if you were to do this with glasses you would find that things would appear as though they were sitting at a strange angle/sloping.    Your best bet is going to be to go and have an eye test and make sure you get a copy of your glasses prescription at the end. In fact, you must have an up to date prescription for glasses in order for you to be supplied with contact lenses, so all you'd need to do is go to your opticain and ask for a copy of your prescription, which they are legally obliged to give you.     Once you have this then it should be pretty clear which number goes in which section of the order form.     If you have 2 seperate pairs of glasses for reading and distance then the reading add should come into play, however you probably won't have this unless you are over 45ish.     With regard to what you should order the best lens for you would probably be the 1.57, your prescription isn't strong enough to warrant paying more for the thinner lenses....(the higher the index number the thinner the lens).  Photochromic lenses are the ones that change in sunlight, (often reffered to as reacto-light lenses)    Just to let you know, bifocals are the lenses with the line going across the lens....a lot of elderly people have them. The to part of the lens is for distance vision and the lower section is for reading. Varifocals are similar in that at the top of the lens is the distance section, and then the lens gradually changes as you move to the bottom, and becomes the reading prescription.     Sorry to have rambled on! Hope this helps.    P.S. you'll find it helpful as well to ask the optician to write down your P.D. measurement. This is the distance between your pupils and you will need it to order glasses as well.
ISbtuWdTaa	It will not mess up your voice aslong as you let it properly heal.  I am a singer and had mine taken out when I was 14.  I didn't speak for nearly 2 weeks.  I only wrote things down when I needed to communicate.      Make sure that you have plenty of ice cream, popsicles, jello, etc. around..    Just be aware that the older you are, the more problems you will have.  Since I was older, I had a lot of clotting problems and ended up in the ER twice in a week because I was bleeding.  It was HORRIBLE.  They had to put a needle in my mouth about 6 inches long, suck out the clot with a strange looking tool, and then cauterize (sp) it so that it would stop bleeding.  I had to do that TWICE.    My suggestion is take it very easy and don't make any more noise than you have to.  Make sure you tell your surgeon that you are a singer and ask him to be extra careful around your vocal chords.    Best of luck!|`|SKlBAtPjaa	Your voice will be way more raspy until you recover and it hurts to eat solid foods, but it shouldn't change your voice.|`|G58hgBvEaa	Doctors usually won't even do this procedure anymore because tonsils help you keep bacteria out of your system.

7726ac41d1155537ecbc00641c63429baa	Hey, I want to tell you that I believe you and you're not just emotionally hurt. I'm not a doctor but I understand what you're going through and that you need to get more serious medical tests like x-rays, a CT scan or an MRI. You need to get you're parents and doctors to believe you. Have they checked your reflexes? It sounds like you have all these physical problems that don't really have anything to do with each other so I'm thinking an MRI for your brain would be best, ASAP. Can you tell me more about the symptoms? Do these problems just appear out of nowhere and then leave? Are your headaches worse at a certain time of day?|`|blRAepCVaa	HI. i am no doctor but i think if all your tests have come out fine then there is no reason to worry. if there was anything seriously wrong with you your doctors would have been more serious about it rather than dismiss it so casually. you seem to be a chronic worrier and your symptoms seem to be psychological. you need to believe in your doctor's advice and learn to relax. you are young and no doubt healthy but you are making yourself sick by worrying so much. the blood tests WOULD NOT come normal if there was anything seriously wrong with you. and doctors are trained to notice the slightest abnormalities at a glance.so stop worrying and start living. you would be fine. if you don't stop worrying then you will  really fall ill.stress and worrying are not good for anyone. think of happy things,try to relax and chill out and you'll feel the difference in your health.all your symptoms sound to be stress related.
6blfbeTGaa	Are you doing any sports? Try joining a sports team and workout regularly at a gym or even at home- If you have Seventeen magazine their workouts are really good.  Also, you want to make your metabolism faster. You know those flavor water packets where you put in the powder and it has flavor? I'm spacing on the name It's like Crystal Lite To go. Well they have metabolism booster and it's supposed to speed up your metaboism. Also, eat more throughout the day. Instead of eating every 6 hours b/c you think you are eating less, it's actually better to eat only al ittle better every 2 or 3 hours.  This will make your metabolism faster. Also, ALWASY eat breakfast. If you don't, then your metabolism slows down and you don't feel hungry the rest of the day. Since you don't eat often your body programs itself to save the fat and food in your body b/c it thinks it can't have food soon. Also, it might be hard but really try to eat healthy. There are foods out there that are actually really good for you and they taste great.  Go to www.hungrygirl.com and they have great snacks that are low in calories and fat. You also want to eat helathy and don't eat just one type of food like veggies, b/c then you are missing your daily amount of meat. Good luck. Exercise daily and eat right. You will lose weight really fast; DEFINATELY by June. Good luck.      Additional info: if sometimes you have cravings but it's just b/c you want flavor, chew gum instead of eating. You will realize you actualyla ren't that hungry.|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	You answered your own question. Stop eating al the wrong foods. Eat until you feel full then stop.

At mealtimes, stop eating when you are no longer hungry. Do not to eat late at night/ before bed. Eat breakfast! Drink as much water as possible. Basically in order to lose weight you need to burn off more calories per day than you are eating. So maybe eat smaller portions at mealtimes- make sure the foods you choose are healthy. Generally speaking, the more colorful the food on your plate is, the better it is for you. Cut out soda from your diet. Even diet soda. If you get hungry between meals, grab a healthy snack- fruit, veggies, etc. Doesn't sound very exciting but you can have like celery with peanut butter or dip it in a bit of dressing. Try to eat as little sugar as possible and cut down your carbohydrates (bread, pasta, etc). And keep exercising. That's the healthy way to do it. The unhealthy way is to starve yourself. Don't do that.|`|Ix5fzn3iaa	if you ever need anyone to talk to let me know i was 180 lbs and lost 20 so far  and i no how mean  people can be too|`|Sj0Sx7T9aa	I'm 16 and Im ten pounds added to 180 and then add another ten pounds haha.

p3qrj7HDaa	They seem to be making a difference with me. I work out about four days a week and make sure I drink at least 80 oz of water a day (not always that easy), and added 1200 mg acai berry extract pills twice daily about a month and a half ago, and I am noticing that it is helping quite a bit. I don't think they would be anywhere near as effective without the working out and large water intake, but in combination with everything it really does seem to be working. I don't know actual numbers, because I stopped weighing myself years ago, I go by how my clothes fit and what I can see in the mirror, and many people have noticed that my skin has been clearer too.    I'm a huge advocate of the acai berry trend.    The only thing that you need to watch is that it really really kills the appetite, like completely. For me at least. I could probably eat just one small meal a day and not even notice it, so I have to make a conscious effort to make sure I'm eating enough throughout the day. Usually keeping a couple bags of almonds or Luna bars in my purse or desk drawer does the trick.|`|S730dpLfaa	Morgan,  I lost 21 lbs last month!

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was theweightlossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|dfyZf6cWaa	should work if you get them organic, chances of those working are high =]|`|uu0UN29vaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several trials and measuring the results.The site is pretty good at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|Gx1CbI56aa	If it is a good quality acai berry product, then yes, it is worth it. Acai is the best known antioxidant fruit that is known on the planet. The antioxidants in acai help to cleanse your body. The natural lipids in acai help to give you more energy and stamina. The fiber in acai helps digestion and fat loss.    I've been using acai berry products for a couple of months now and I've noticed that yes they do work. I used them when I wanted to trim off about 15lbs.    I knew that diet and exercise alone would help achieve that goal alone but I needed something to help me with my mid afternoon snacking urges. This is where I found the acai berry really helped me.    It helped to curb those mid afternoon urges which meant when I went out jogging later that night I wasn't just jogging to work off that bag of Doritios I snacked on around 3pm instead I was actually working off the weight I wanted..    After a couple months I now no longer needed the supplements and can manage my weight more easily, so I found that yes they really did help speed up my weight loss goals when I used them along with a diet and exercise program, as the berries gave me more energy and helped to curb my appetite    I got my free trial bottle from the site below|`|sOO5OmWmaa	hey there morgan,with the pills + good diet + good exercise regime,losing 15 pounds is not a problem.

Talk to your friends or family and see who can help you out and give you a place to stay temporarily. Then have them help you move your stuff out when he isn't there. Don't tell him, don't confront him, and don't answer your phone when he calls. If he finds you and makes trouble, call the police. Guys like this are stupid bullies and it just gets worse, the violence will get physical towards you and never stop, plus the mental abuse towards you is just as bad if not worse. If he is always there, just leave and have a police escort go with you to get your stuff, explain the situation to them, they are used to dealing with this kind of thing. Best of luck and don't wait. do it asap !!! and get yourself on good birth control !!!|`|6nDqvtwbaa	He sounds like he could be a dangerous man, sis.    Sometimes these guys just totally flip when you abandon them and want to leave.      For the guys that truly are really dangerous, there is no way that you can be protected from them.  I hope he is not like that.    You might consider leaving town and not telling ANYONE basically where you are going so that there is no way he can find you.  Maybe I'm overreacting, but some men really are very dangerous.    If they find out they find, for example, at what woman's shelter you are at, everyone at the shelter is then in danger.  These are the most extreme cases, though.    Think carefully how you deal with him.    God Bless You.|`|i7XkKqhgaa	are there woman refuges in new york? maybe next time your out do a lil research. they can help ytou leave, pick up your stuff and hide you|`|2gh84Ec6aa	just get some divorce papers and see if you can bring a cop with you so he doesnt hurt you. then move away from him and dont let him know where your going.|`|nOtAlizDaa	if you think he is really dangerous u should leave. dont you know anyone you can stay with till you can find a place? hopefully its somewhere he doesnt kow where it is. if he hasnt actually hurt you im not sure if he would. but you have seen him get violent with others? if his temper really scares you and you dont feel safe thats not good.|`|1054d5bacf2db9df1e90bd60c3b07322aa	omg thats soo scary! he sounds over protective. you should go out on a night that hes with his crowd and go with your friends. take your things with you leave some stuff behind so he wont notice whats going on right away and stay with a friend. if ur scared hell do something call and warn the cops and see if one can watch ur house. good luck hope i helped.|`|tvy2K59haa	If you are scares you, I would see a lawyer and talk to them when he thinks your at work. You will find a new guy, if this isn't working out then do not force it. best of luck. :) Be.Strong.  *women power*|`|H5n4T6HDaa	Just divorce him.  You dont like him,and thats understandable.you really should.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	First of all, if you dont want to get pregnant by him, that one is very easy to prevent. either get on birth control, or dont allow him to sleep with you.  second, i have been in a similar situation. i have to tell you, get out now before he gets violent with YOU. sounds like it will happen, and once it does, the fear gets worse. there is no easy way to leave. you just HAVE to. when he is gone away from the house, pack up all your things, and just GO. stay with your parents, with a friend, a hotel, just away. and DONT go back. ignore his pleadings, the "i will change", because they never do. you can get all the advice in the world, but it all wont matter unless you TAKE ACTION.     good luck.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	First of all, remember that this is your life, and it is precious. Walk out that door and do not look back.    Go to your parents' home or a trusted person and have more than one male cousin, friend, uncle, relative return for your belongings.    Do not fall into the trap of "forgetting" some crazy item of sentimental value. Do not give him any excuses, reasons, no forwarding address, no telephone number---just walk away.     There are lots of safe houses for women in your situation in your area, simply call 1.800.LIFENET in New York City or 1.800.543.3638 and you will receive aid through the crisis intervention resource center at the New York City Dept of Health or follow this link:    http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cis/cis...    They will assist you so that you do not have to return home to face fear of violence ever again.|`|JFw1dj0Naa	Where is the hole you fall into to get pregnant?|`|Yhw6KwEFaa	you should talk to your parents and friends. i dont really know about these situations but im sure there is someone specialized for them|`|ycr6iVRraa	I so glad your strong enough to ask for help. He sounds very unbalanced and in these situations they can go from bad too much worse.    I watched my mum go through a very abuse relationship with my step father. He was always pleading with her that he loved he but had a real temper. Mum just keeped giving him chance after chance and he just got more violent.    My advice is to leave asap and don't tell him where you are going. Take the day off work when he is not there, grab everything that you can (that has value) and go! You shouldn't have to stay with him, he is psychologically abusive and you don't owe him anything. Your safety and your life its top priority. If you have family or trustworthy friends arrange to go stay with them. He will try to find you so make sure you are with people you trust. Also give the local police a heads up and tell them about your concerns. If he tries anything you can get a restraining order put on him.     I would see a councilor as well, just to help with your self esteem. This doesn't mean your weak, its just a smart way of dealing with a very stressful situation. They may also have productive and practical resources you can take advantage of.    I wish you all the best....just remember to stand strong and to put yourself first.  xx
57d1ac7f50ba1de4b150dce035c710d2aa	You really need to ask YOURSELF why do you STAY in what you have described as a fearful relationship. No one is forcing you to stay. Did your parents have a bad relationship? You might be unconsciously reliving that. Do you feel low self esteem? Maybe you think he is the only thing you can get.     If you really are serious about leaving, then you need to have a plan. Organise somewhere to stay and make sure it won't fall through at the last minute. Ask a few friends (preferably male) to come with you the day you leave. More males there your B/F is less likely to do anything stupid to you. Perhaps write a letter to him and leave it somewhere for him to find after you have left explaining how you don't feel safe and needed to be away from him.     If you are really worried he might do something stupid when you are leaving you can actually organise the police to attend. You must let them know a few days in advance you need them there and why. They are usually more than happy to do that.    Make sure you have no contact with him afterwards, if you forget to take something from your old place, then live without it. If he calls you up, change your number. Remind your friends he may know, to also not give any information about you to him.    If you don't leave soon, it will only get worse, and you sound to me that you already know that. So get out now while you can and then meet the guy who is out there waiting for a lovely intelligent woman who deserves better than what she is getting now.    Good luck!|`|TsjqzanQaa	Well, you can move in with friends in New York, and it I were you I would leave as quickly as I can.    Such individuals who are so possessive seem to think that they own the other person, and are controlling and there isn't any way to make them see that they're completely unreasonable and irrational.    Move, cut all ties, and let your friends know that he's a whacko and potentially dangerous.      You can get a restraining order.    I suggest that you don't go anywhere alone, and that you try to do your best to avoid him, whatever you have to do.     Ask your family to help.    Don't let him intimidate you.      You have rights, and one of these is to live your life free from the fear of intimidation from this individual.    Whatever you do, don't fall for the old,"I can change, it'll be different."    He won't change; people seldom do.       Sever all ties and all communication with him for your own sake.    It's a shame that "the man of your dreams" turned out to be the man of your nightmares.    If he tries to harass you, take steps immediately.|`|4lbgJXI0aa	Well, you've made the right decision to leave him. I would tell him you're gonna leave. Hopefully he'll understand (if he says he'll change I wouldn't really buy it). If you think he won't understand/will get violent, then try calling the police. There are also a lot of good organizations for women in your situation|`|i6RlYFo7aa	be smart and get out of that relationship FAST!!!!    my dad used to treat me like that and he would beat me and one day i decided i was going to stop forgiving him and now i rarely see him, i was like "peace", you should do the same|`|9nDhR7xWaa	Hi,    Sounds like you have some serious issues, and seemingly definatly need to leave him. Just a thought but maybe take him like surprised, this happened to my mate and it worked on him.    Arrange for a courier van to get your belongings from the house you are living in, but do not tell him. If you can arrange it when he will not be in the house even better. Tell him at the last minute - when you have friends there and he wont really have time to respond to the situation.. Just dont tell him by yourself incase he gets aggressive.    Maybe an excuse like "My parents need me at home" or you just want a little time to yourself would help??    Either way he sounds like a jerk, and is definately not for you. Its now or never, do you want to spend your whole life this this person?|`|E0PQQaNjaa	contact friends and your family and tell them exactly whats' happenning. file restraining orders. and you don't fall pregnant. It isn't an accident. Make a choice and prevent pregnancy. Make a choice and leave him.|`|qxw1k0Kmaa	you should be as careful as possible before you break up with him. like find yourself a place to live and think about other expenses before you break up with hom becasue he might kick you out of the house. You MUST break up with him becase no one deserves to be doubted like he doubts you. And if he has bad friends than they might make him do things that you dont want him to do. Good Luck. I'll pray to god that you get out of this mess safely.|`|AA12022261	he seems obsessive and dangerous kick him in the... you finish..|`|X4leB44Baa	If you need to have people around you when you break up. For example tell your parents, siblings, or friends. You need to move out of the apartment may into something in the city near friends? He sounds dangerous so be careful.|`|0T6ympIvaa	I will suggest you leave him cause later down the line he'll get worst and i will hate that to happen to you, member theirs always gonna be someone better in the world so leave if you can go stay alone or move back in with your parents until you pick yourself up again Just don't let  him get to the point where he won't let you leave
T0pkW783aa	Do NOT go back for one day, one hour or one more minute.  When you leave for work, take the things that are most important to you or call the police and ask them to come while you gather your belongings and let them stay until you get everything.  Go to a shelter and get a restraining order to keep him from going after you.  He sounds very dangerous.  If you must, for your personal safety, leave everything behind and get away with your life.  It is more important than any possessions.  Go for counseling to help you understand why you put up with this behavior so you won't fall into that same kind of situation again.  Men who become this controlling and show tendencies for violence usually increase in their anger, their control and their displays of violent behavior.  I know; I have been there and got away with my life when things got way out of hand.  Life has never been better since I left and got some counseling to help me learn to love myself enough to make some changes   Please do the same for yourself.  No one deserves to live like this.|`|55oy2i5caa	His control is abuse, plain & simple. I'm worried it's going to escalate to (more) physical violence. Please leave ASAP! Don't tell him you're leaving him, just go. Change your phone number.

Maybe he gets jealous really easily and wants to insure your his. Just be lucky that he cares about you.|`|5HTylrjGaa	You are obviously a very intelligent woman, because you can clearly see that this guy is out of his mind!

Good luck!!!|`|r5QG8utSaa	well im very sorry about this! good idea to get out of this relationship! i dont really know but i think u shoud probably break up with him in a public place (like a resturant) so if he does get violent there will be ppl around. and also then in order to get ur stuff out of ur house be sure to bring someone with u so hes not crazy. always be around ppl to help u. good luck!|`|JmsnX0lSaa	SCREW HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GET OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                         AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bIEyAxW3aa	All I can say is DON'T LISTEN TO LACY M!  Someone who loves you wants you to be happy. If you have given no reason not to be trusted, than what reason does this person have to think that you will betray him. The way I see it is that he views you as his possession that exists to make him happy. That is not love. If you enjoy going out with your friends then the one you love should be happy that you are enjoying yourself. Get away from him for the love of god!! Seriously!!! RUN RUN!!|`|Q4oPyclQaa	Get out of there... women's shelters might have good escape strategies that you can use.  He is an *** and you deserve better.  Be careful not to get involved with guys who have short fuses.  I know it's hard, you can't always tell right away.|`|tVhHAv32aa	omg you need to leave him!  grow a backbone and tell the loser off!|`|ryGHtoddaa	get a restraining order.    make him be 50 feet away from you or else he will be going to jail.|`|GR07LyyTaa	leave, call the cops and get a restraining order and the 2nd he breaks the restraining order call the cops and get his as* locked up. may seem like a hassle but it is worth it in the end, you never no how far he will go, and one day it will be too far.
WXExyAlWaa	You can actually train your memory to improve it with a bit of work, just like anything else. See if you can find any websites or books (in the library) about memory training - generally it's exercises like remembering strings of numbers, or matching names and faces, or remembering what's in a picture, and as you do more of them you'll find you improve.

Pre-ejaculate neutralizes residual acidity in the urethra caused by urine, creating a more favorable environment for the passage of sperm. The vagina is normally acidic; the deposit of pre-ejaculate prior to the emission of semen may change the vaginal environment to promote sperm survival.  Pre-ejaculate also acts as a lubricant during intercourse, and plays a role in semen coagulation.|`|AF6u4Nvhaa	poop!|`|NGYa5Q0oaa	pre-***, secrets from your cowpers gland.

B8WEoAiKaa	There is no treatment for asymptomatic HPV infection. Instead, doctors treat the health problems that are caused by the HPV virus.When genital warts appear, a variety of treatments can be used. The patient can apply prescription creams at home. Or a doctor can surgically remove or freeze off the warts.Early treatment of warts is discouraged by some doctors because genital warts can go away on their own. It can also take time for all warts to appear. So a person who treats warts as soon as they appear may need another treatment later on.Anal cancer can be treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. The specific treatments depend on the stage of cancer - how big the tumor is and how far the cancer has spread.|`|jpqSnCpuaa	no i havent but hpv is a virus and there is no cure it just has to run its course or you will have it forever either way it sucks.  just so you know you shouldn't feel bad b/c even if you use a condom you can still get hpv|`|nPt7hUE8aa	There's many different strains of it. I was told I had it when I had an abnormal papsmear, they biopsied and it wasn't cancer. They said it was HPV and told me not to worry. I haven't had an abnormal smear since and there's no HPV, that was 7years ago. Some strains are there for the long haul... others are short and don't cause any problems... I was told some strains are even communicable thru sharing things like drinks, straws... etc.
JBqjLvmdaa	You can try a mainstream diet (South Beach, Adtkins, etc.).  What I did was cut all of my portions in half.  Take the amount you usually take during the day and cut it in half.  If you usually have a steak, a baked potato, and two cups of corn, cut it in half and have half of your streak, half of your potato, and one cup of corn.  That way you can still have what you've been eating and build up portion control.  It is a very safe and easy first diet plan.  No extra cost, no eliminating foods.  Unfortunately, it will take longer (1-2 pounds a week) than a mainstream diet.    Exercise is also key.  Cutting portions in half + 20 minutes of nonstop cardio 3-5 times a week will melt those pounds.    Breakfast is also the best and smartest meal of the day.  By eating a filling breakfast, your metabolism boosts and you get energy for the day.  Skipping breakfast will not quicken your dieting, it'll actually slow it down.    Stay away from sugary sodas.  Drink diet from now on.|`|su7HU590aa	try drinking more water and watching what you eat. plus excersise more|`|hnsTDoyuaa	Less calories in, more out...eat right and exercise...i would know...i'm very large...it's really hard.|`|GBS1Wmpeaa	Eat fruit and vegetables and exercise daily, not much to it.|`|paCHaDWVaa	Go to the fat doctor.....|`|BI49Z79Faa	Don't know how old you are..... but a general rule is to cut out the refined carbs, focus on protein and complex carbs.

LdB22dPUaa	Well how long did you lose it? Like a couple months a week or a couple days? If its been a few months, then probably yes you do need to start over. If its only been a couple days or maybe as far as a week, you could try to wear the other invisilign retainers that you have to see if you can get to the point where you left off. Your dentist can call invisilign and ask them to make a replacement to the ones you lost. But it will cost you either way : (|`|q7p2LnAiaa	yes, since they are doing the same procedure. some doctors may be nice and give you a slight discount, but i think you may be stuck with paying again.    i shuld put my retainers on now!!|`|c331d6c3aad95995667ec36e765f9579aa	Yea I think that it will cost the same amount, it would for my ortho.

All I can tell you to do is relax. don't wear a jacket all day inside. things like that. but mostly, just find some  things to help you relax|`|mW39emMdaa	maybe because of the thing u do in school  makes u sweat alot|`|HW1CklWaaa	use certain dry deodorant, it really works. it takes like a week or something to work, but I for some reason get wet armpits and it totally stopped that problem.|`|PleCBQeqaa	It happens to me occasionally too, and I think it's like a nervous thing. Once you feel you're going to start sweating, it makes you start getting nervous thinking about it, which makes you actually sweat. Once you start sweating, you start stressing over it more, causing you to sweat more.    All you need to do is stop that initial nervousness. Keep your brain calm, because when you have a calm brain, everything else stays normal. It's like most people with stomach aches, nervous brain=nervous stomach, and nervous stomach escalates into stomach pains and things that wouldn't have been there in the first place if the person had just kept calm.
WJWW7NXaaa	Aside from the obvious genitalia differences, from the top down    Men have slightly more protuberant eyebrows, broader shoulders and straighter waists.

6qsocyK3aa	First thing you need to do is stop feeling so sorry for yourself. Life is what you make it. Surely you're old enough to get some sort of part-time job. With the money you make from that, you can buy yourself some decent clothes and feel a bit more in control of your life. I know you resent your mother for the situation you're in but I highly doubt it's entirely her fault, if her fault at all, and you blaming her for everything just makes you sound like a spoiled brat. You can't control the situation your family is in but you can control the situation YOU'RE in. If you're big enough to feel this badly about your life, you're big enough to change it yourself. Wallowing in self-pity will not get you anywhere.    You think you have it bad? What about homeless people who live in carrier bags? What about poor African orphans who have to eat ants to survive? Seriously, you need to think just how priviledged you are.    EDIT: You say you haven't had a party for five years. Well guess what, there's people who have never had a party at all and probably never will because they're African orphans who have to trekk 10 miles a day just to fetch some dirty water to drink. You talk like having a party for your birthday is a necessity - get over yourself! You'll survive without one. What is necessary is adequete food and shelter which you have. No, life is not easy for you at the minute but you will not get one ounce of sympathy on here if you don't appreciate what you do have. You're old enough to do something about it. Why don't you get off your *** and get a part-time job? Then you'll be able to pay for these luxeries that you seem to think are necessaties.     Have you ever read A Chid Called It by David Pelzer? Now that is what I call a a crap life. You live in heaven compared to him, believe me. He probably got fed dog sh*t on his birthday. I strongly suggest you read it. Giving the impression you are not grateful for what you have will not get you an ounce of sympathy when there's true stories like that out there. Just get over yourself and get yourself a bloody job.|`|5J0sIvksaa	If it makes you feel any better honey, I'll be spending my sweet sixteen recovering from surgery. It's a hard knock life!   Good Luck, I suggest prayer.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Awwww poor you. You have a roof over your head, food in your belly, and probably much more. Think about all the homeless people who have nothing but a box. You are getting an education. That's what you are there for, nothing else - not to be in a fashion show or show off your newest toy. You need to grow up and have some empathy for your mom, who is doing her best to provide for you. Instead of whining about what you don't have, how about thanking her for what you do have? And then go volunteer at a homeless shelter and see what I mean. Meanwhile, go get a babysitting job or paper route and help earn some money for the household. Finally, remember that love and family mean more in this world than any material objects will. Be thankful for all you have, and feel rich that someone loves you so much like your mom.|`|tvy2K59haa	At least your not living on the street. When you get older you will be able to be in charge of your own pay check. Make sure you stay in school to get your education. Everything is okay.

AA12091376	80% of people have oral Herpes or cold sores.  In order to know if it is HSV or acne, one would have to get the Western Blott type specific blood test.  It costs about $150 through LabCorps.      Many people get oral Herpes from their family when they are young.  I wouldn't try to catch it on purpose if I were you, but if you care about the person, it shouldn't matter.  FYI - having oral sex with someone who has a cold sore can give you genital Herpes.  So, just keep that in mind too.  Hope that helps!|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	the 100% way to   know for sure is to get tested
zddIYf9vaa	try not to lie, so your nose wont get any bigger|`|FH2KUed8aa	Yep.  Your nose and your feet continue growing even after the rest of your body has matured.

I used Bio oil for stretch marks, my daughter is 5 months and I was lucky enough to get no marks at all on my tummy just a few on my breasts. However now thanx to Bio oil they are gone! It really works and is not as expensive as some other options!|`|AA12198724	You can buy a massager at like rite aid or a pharmacy and apply lotion and massage the area with the massager a couple times a day, that helps break up the fat. Or nivea has a 30 day cellulite package plan and it comes with cream and pills and some instructions. They sell that in the packages.
jh15tzdmaa	mostly likely it is simply a very severe case of bronchitis. I have had bronchitis before and I only coughed up mucus-y phlegm-y type substances; however, my doctor said that it is not uncommon for a person to cough up blood. Bronchitis can take a while to heal and I would recommend lots of bed rest until you start to feel better. That is the only thing that helped me.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	never -call 911.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	It is never normal to cough up blood. And 5 tablespoons is a lot.The bronchitis could lead to conditions which cause hemoptysis(coughing up blood). With that much blood you should be checked by a doctor again. You can have a little blood if you cough hard and break little blood vessels but 5 tablespoons is too much. Get it checked out.|`|PhNzEkVnaa	5 tablespoons of blood is a lot to cough up.  If it is just blood tinged mucus then it is a part of the infections. Post nasal secretions can pool in the back of the throat at night and be coughed up in the morning. If you are truly coughing up that much blood you should get a blood test to check your counts to make sure that you aren't losing too much and weakening your self further.  Also a white count indicative of infection.  Most of these things start with a virus that last a long time and then a secondary infection sets as a complication.  The anti biotic treat the secondary, bacteria infection but the virus can linger.|`|7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	Sometimes the hard coughing of Bronchitis or Pneumonia will cause a little blood to be in the mucus.  If you're coughing real hard, maybe you need an inhaler to help bring the mucus up without straining.  As long as the coughing up a little blood stops when you start to feel better everything is fine.  If you're coughing up 5 tablespoons of blood then you should check back with the doctor.  Or are you talking about blood streaked mucus, that may be ok.  Call your doctor to ask.    Take the antibiotics, but you must get some Yogurt or Keifer to help your stomach and intestines or else you will be having diarrhea also.  Keifer is the best if you can find it.  Yogurt you can find anywhere.    EDIT:  From your added details, I think this is not normal If it is coming from your lungs.  Dark red and 5 tablespoons? No, this is not normal in my opinion.  Check with your doctor.  If it is indeed just a broken blood vessel from all the coughing, maybe there is a procedure like cauterization of that blood vessel.   I don't know, the people I've seen coughing blood are people like advanced copd and tb.  So its not likely that you have either of these so you must check with your doctor about the bleeding.    On more thing, do you ever blow your nose in the morning?  And do you see blood?  Just thinking some of the blood may be from your nose.    Here is a good website with information about coughing blood.  http://www.mothernature.com/Library/book...    This is what the mayoclinic has to say about it  " If it is a large quantity of blood  more than a few teaspoons  seek emergency medical care."  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemopty...
zddIYf9vaa	not exactly sure whats wrong with you    trying eating healthy and drink loads of water, normally this works even without anitbiotic.    when im sick i dont take any pills because those have side effects and such. i just stick with the nature and i get better within a day.|`|AA11311675	Go here  http://symptoms.webmd.com/symptomchecker    and choose ALL your actual symptoms, its pretty accurate|`|6359LQLNaa	antibiotics sometimes take up to 10 days.  idk whats wrong with you i wish i could help.  but wait it out a couple days and if the symptoms persist then go to the doctor and demand to know whats wrong|`|SQ9mLTnaaa	sounds to me like a severe fever.  antibiotics shouldn't be making it worse though,   i suggest just drink a lot of  water and get a lot of rest.|`|DeHb2mPpaa	I would go see a real doctor.

You see once the food drops from your stomach to your immune system it goes to poop and stays in a net like ab that streches out your butt and that's what makes it bigger. Believe me It's true even though it sounds a little weird.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	It is not stored (for long), it is expelled. Storing it would make you seriously ill.

If you need to use something to go to the bathroom use a enemia. The liquid in the bottle you put into your rectum. It is much faster, doesn't hurt, and it only cause the muscles in the rectum to contract causing the bowel movement. Unlike laxatives that contain medicine that mess with your bodys chemistry. Very harmful. The feces stays in your bowels. Large intestines. You really need to see a doctor about help with your eating disorder.|`|BSsdkFwLaa	its in your large intestine. and want some good advice, let me just say that i have been where you are i lost 40 pounds in less than 2 months. im over my depression and have been eating healthy since.      1 please make sure you take a vitamin supplement. i take the centrum orange chewables,   2  make sure you are constantly hydrating. juicing and smoothies are really helpful too.   3 if you are going to choose to not get help then at least become a health nut and don't let your body waste.   4  if you don't take theses steps not only will you be thin but your bones will be weak, you will lose color in your skin due to lack of blood flow, your hair and nails will be weak and brittle (not too glamorous)   5 so do what i say and not only will you be thin but beautiful too   6 but seriously all things aside you know that this is a problem you need to take the steps to heal yourself but you have to want it.|`|2ef2c0e844e19038f6a979bb78073d8daa	Colon.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	in your intestines ... large one i think has feces|`|WpaQKpckaa	Oh.. hun   I hope you get better|`|3ME7sBxjaa	Rectum, it's the final straight portion of the large intestine.|`|s8XoXFc4aa	Your colon.

Not much makes it on to the poop.  Your body needs food for a number of reasons.  It uses it for energy, for building proteins, building new cells, hormones, etc. etc.  and yes, for storage as fat.  Only stuff that your digestive system cannot break down enough for the body to absorb, or that your body does not need, gets to the poo hole.  Your body needs everything that it can get.  Normal people eat regularly.  Your body handles the food in three places: the stomach, and the small and large intestine.  The large intestine essentially sucks up liquid, making your poop solid.  When people eat, it signals the body to move things along.  Whatever is in the small intestines needs to be moved out to make room for the new food.  If you don't eat, then stuff doesn't need to move along as fast.      Also, when you do not eat a healthy diet, it does become hard to poop.  You ever hear of metamucil, or those fiber tablets.  These make pooping easier, because they are fiber, something the body does not digest.|`|SP8wNcp8aa	holy crap alot of people answered this question. try sitting on the toilet and yodeling|`|VazN1ckdaa	Well if you don't eat anything then there isn't anything for you body to digest. Please go see a doctor.|`|DueU0xc4aa	see i wonder this question also. i dont think pooping has a much effect on the outlook of how much ur eating. But yes some of the stuff in your body you will poop, not evrything though. i watched once on Oprah that it builds up in your stomach than something happens, than it leaves your colon.but i do kno dat when you pee, and if your pee is a darker color than it usually is this means you are dehydrated.|`|CdfqJyYCaa	you cant be anorexic and go binge eating they are exact opposites    and what kind of stupid, screwed up,****ed up kind of question is that|`|ra9FbUKmaa	Normally in your intestines, but if you don't eat enough, it'll end up in your colon and stay there forever (which is not good, obviously).    Anyway, laxatives aren't good either for your body. Your body should be able to produce waste after every meal. This doesn't necessarily mean you should go to the washroom 3 times a day, but once a day should be enough times and should be a normal thing for you.|`|KtFZt9Tiaa	It goes from your stomach, into your small intestines where more absorbtion of nutrients occurs then through your large intestines which is the ascending, transverse which moves right to left across your abdomen, then descending which goes down the left side and ultimately empties into your bowel, where once full, the pressure is supposed to cause peristalsis, which is the muscular movement just like swallowing and it pushes it out. If you have a sluggish system or have relied on laxatives as you have said, it may not move through due to lacking peristalsis and it can build up and become toxic when it putrifies. It used to take 3 days for one meal to go through me. Now I can get it through in about a day and half. It takes quite awhile to get regular once I stopped doing laxatives.|`|WxSQA1ZKaa	Well it sounds like your digestive system is out of whack from not eating a normal/ stable diet. Its good that you are aware of your eating disorder and not in denial. I strongly suggest you try and sort that out if you haven't already begun. I know, easier said than done. But i've been there. I know how hard it is and I think its really brave of you to admit it. About the poo, If you depend on laxatives, then your body will get used to only going when you do use them. Try to lay off the laxatives and let your body do its thing. And the digestive problems you are experiencing are most likely related to the eating disorder. Try prunes or figs or fig juice instead of laxatives if you feel constipated. All the food you ate probably went to your body to give it energy and the waste is in your lower intestine/ colon/ sphincter. You will poo eventually most likely- really try eating prunes, figs, or pears (healthy food!). If by saturday you haven't had a bowel movement try a doc. good luck. hang in there.|`|zhxifEpoaa	in your ***hole|`|zk86eQy0aa	it stays in uranus...|`|M05njhazaa	just throw up your food instead of pooping it, i heard its more ethical and better for the environment|`|46YGA8ioaa	man your gay

yNvA3Wreaa	Symptoms of AIDS are opportunistic infections, unexplained fevers, night sweats, and weight loss.  Untreated, AIDS leads to death in usually under two years.  However, lifespan can be greatly extended with modern medication, and people infected with HIV can live for decades with a managed infection.      Following HIV transmission a person may be undiagnosed for years.  During this time the virus is not dormant, but at war with the immune system.  New viruses are constantly being created and destroyed, and your body's white blood cells are dying as fast as they are being made.  Eventually the immune system wears out, and symptoms of AIDS appear.  Anti-HIV medication reduces the levels of virus in the bloodstream and postpones the development of AIDS, but a person infected with HIV will always be positive for HIV, always have to take medication and monitor their white blood cell levels, and always have to take measures to prevent passing HIV on to others.       HIV transmission risks can be reduced greatly by using condoms.  If you are at risk for HIV transmission (have multiple partners or unprotected sex with someone whose HIV status is unknown, for instance) you should be tested for HIV every six months.  After initially being infected with HIV a person may have no symptoms, and HIV tests early in infection will show a negative result even though the person may have very high levels of virus.  For this reason it is important to practice safe sex always.  If you haven't had any high-risk exposures in the last six months and have tested negative, you are HIV negative and don't have to worry about getting tested again until you have another potential exposure.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	the first symptoms just after you become hiv positive{which is not aids it just means you have the virus}can be flu like and then just last a very short time. The next symptoms can be years later and would probably when you have full blown aids they include skin lesions rare forms of pneumonia what aids is is a virus that attacks your immune system letting your body get all sorts of illnesses it cant fight off.If the person finds out when they are hiv positive there are medications and things you can do to help ward off aids.People are living many years with hiv now compared to when the disease first presented itself.

uKmNYqGgaa	I take generic Wellbutrin SR (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) with dinner, for depression and anxiety.  I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.     The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.     The doctors have diagnosed that I'm clinically depressed - which means I will be on some antidepressant the rest of my life.     I feel 100% better right now than before I started taking the medications - they've been a real lifesaver for me.     I'm 56...     I hope that answered your questions, if you have any more questions feel free to email or message me.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	If you are a teenager, you should NOT take prescription anti anxiety meds, they are NOT formulated for teenagers and can be very dangerous. Try taking St. John's Wort instead, it is an herbal remedy and works very well for most. Please try this first. My teenage daughter used this when she went through a very bad time and it worked great. The doctor wanted to put her on Prozac and we refused. When she went back to the doctor ( therapist - she was raped) the doc never knew and thought she was taking the Prozac and she responded very well. It really worked for her, she took it for a year and decided to stop taking it on her own when she felt better.

dd30d07061d6ae74b156e18ca10ad7e2aa	Yes, it is contagious, but it doesn't thrive well on dry floors or on bare feet. Do you or one of your housemates have foot fungus? It's generally called 'athlete's foot' for a good reason, it spreads mostly in locker rooms where the floor is often a bit damp from the showers and sweat, and the temperature is often kept warm (same with bathroom floors). On a dry floor spores won't live very long, but don't share towels (also damp!) or shoes (inside them spores can live longer too), or play footsie (with direct contact of course the spores can be transferred too).    Also even if he picks up some spores from the floor, if the kid goes barefoot a lot indoors he'll probably be fine. The fungus needs a warm, dark and damp place to grow, like the inside of a shoe. On the surface of the bare skin, exposed to light and fresh air, any spores picked up will quickly die rather than catch hold and infect someone. Athlete's foot is very rare in populations that go barefoot more often, rather than more common as many people would think. If you plan to take the kid for a long walk (long time in closed shoes, feet getting warm and sweaty from the exercise too) and he has to go potty just before leaving, let him put on his shoes before going into the bathroom. But in general, making him keep shoes on all the time isn't necessary.|`|6j8d7TZTaa	No its not they have stuff in stores you can try or you can go to the doctors and ask about taking the medicine they have out on prescription now.

EDXh0tk9aa	It means you are are normal and started puberty.    Once you start puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused. Trust me, you don't ever want it to go away. You will also have your own scent - musky - and will smell stronger to you than to others.    You can have this normal discharge for weeks, months or even years before getting your first period. It will also continue after you get your period. You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers you.     Different Types of Discharge:    White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.    Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.    Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.    Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.    Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.    Different types of infections:    Signs of yeast infections:  White, cottage cheese-like discharge  Swelling and pain around the vulva  Intense itching    Signs of bacterial vaginosis:  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge  A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap  Itching or burning  Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva|`|TPPZp8IYaa	Clearish, from my experience, meant that I was pregnant... are you sexually active?

So you won't look retarded in the locker room.|`|LXxIxf13aa	b4 we start im not tryin to b meen or funny tryna tell u tha truth      1. Do not embaress your self by switching to tightie whities    2.Honestly i would laugh at you but who will really be looking around the locker to c what other guys wear under there clothes    3.Changing in private is too much work in my opinion    4. Hanes are the best i wear them    hope i helped|`|ICZJak8taa	you might catch the eyes of gay men lol|`|bRujKmKFaa	Prodige is a good brand for briefs|`|AA12022261	i dont think anyone cares honestly|`|eBOxRUl7aa	As I high schooler, Im guessing some people might make fun of you but i wouldnt care. So wear colored briefs.and dont get low rise. for brands, um idk go to kohls or jc pennys or something .|`|BJ8sDP4Gaa	Unfortunately tighty whities will draw unwanted attention from the other guys in the locker room. I tried to hide my TWs by wearing boxers over them but that ended up backfiring. I needed support as well for sports as well as keeping random erections from sticking out too much like they did with boxers. My buddy pulled my boxers off one day in the locker room so every guy saw I was trying to hide my briefs. My buddy and I were the only guys in our gym class that wore briefs everyday. He didnt care if people teased him and after he pulled my boxers off, I didnt care as much. I wore Calvin Klein tighty whities because they were nicer looking and more comfortable for my activities. They guys ripped on me for a little while but they werent cruel. Plus I told them how much girls like my Cks which shut them up. After that, I didnt care if guys thought wearing tighty whities was a bad thing. I was well supported when I ran, lifted weights and swam plus it worked really well at hiding erections. If you wanna switch to TW, I say go for it because they are more practical for what you need.  If they other guys give you crap, tell them they shouldnt be so concerned about your underwear.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Why should you care what anybody else thinks or says?  I wear them l& have for years.  Anybody don't like it?  That's tough!  As long as I like them & they are comfortable, it's nobody else's business but mine.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	best to use boxer briefs or coloured briefs|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Boxer-briefs or jockstrap. There's ya support.    So far as the locker room goes, who cares? Just be yourself, act natural. Everyone has different tastes. American Eagle or Hanes are good brands.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	i think they feel better on your nuts bc they give support    hanes is good  if you're emberassed about wearing briefs, go with boxer briefs|`|KhS39gLqaa	i've heard that hanes is a good brand.  as for getting made fun of in the locker room, wear boxers over your briefs?|`|cq9E1e6Aaa	why shouldnt you change to brief most 17 years old wear brief( not kidding) boxer brief are for people who wants to change to brief but are too scared..|`|eth48m7Iaa	wear what u want. I think Hanes are a good brand.|`|dH9IhDIFaa	You could compromise with boxer briefs.  Fruit of the Loom for the win!|`|68r4mmOnaa	IF you don't want to get embarresed,  wear boxers over your tighty whiteys. But if you have an erection,  its hurrts, and if your penis is always in a tight space, it can't really get bigger. So mine to you.

Plus it is good clean (well ish) fun!|`|N19mmDELaa	yea, its good for you. and if you dont masturbate you'll end up having wet dreams. it has to come out one way or another! have fun!|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Of course it's good for you.  Anything that feels that good can't be bad.  And yeah, it's good for your prostate and there is some research that suggests it may help in the prevention of prostate cancer.    So go for it - it might save your life!|`|1JhBe6STaa	For men, masturbation or regular sex is good for the prostate and can prevent painful prostate blockage. For women it can help reduce cramping and for both men and women has been shown to have a healthy effect on the immune systems as well as reducing overall tension and helping emotions.|`|nljHInxOaa	dont know if  that is true but it defnetly cures anxiety|`|fNs20NZEaa	email liam foster|`|AA10561400	very true|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Yes, it's very healthy, and keeps your prostate in good shape. :)    All the people going 'OMG MASTURBATION IS WONG' are most likely religious and still believe it gives you hairy palms..|`|tKfOcgDlaa	I think that IS NOT TRUE!!!!!!|`|nHD8nQTRaa	Yes.

rpnFxnCQaa	There is very good evidence to support the idea that there are genetic vulnerabilities for anxiety-proneness that are passed on biologically from one generation to the next.     In anxiety disorders, so the current thinking goes, a high-neurotic person panics, and then learns to avoid doing things that would possibly make them panic again. In a sense they learn to avoid feeling fearful, and in so doing, restrict their range of activities sometimes down to a bare minimum required for life. Effective treatment for anxiety disorders is available, and words on the principle that one can learn, through successive approximated exposures to feared-but-not-actually-dangerous events, and through teaching one how to make a realistic rather than a fear-driven appraisal of threat, to tolerate fear feelings. You'll want to look into cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety, available in most cities (and nowadays towns too) through a licensed Clinical Psychologist.    You may want to look at this website for more information:  http://www.mentalhelp.net    If I were you, I would consult a specialist.    From my own experience, this program also works very well to treat anxiety:  http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com    Good luck!|`|ENANtueuaa	It does sound like anxiety and can be hereditary, although it's not always. I have anxiety so i understand where you are coming from. I do not take medication, i deal with on my own. It's all about mind over matter. My hands tingle when i start to get anxious. When you start feeling anxious, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, it will relax you. Maybe your getting anxious because you don't want to be late to your next class. Anxiety can happy for any reason, and sometimes there is no reason at all. Just think, what's the worst that can happen...i'll be marked late for class, not the end of the world. When you think about things this way, you can learn to control your anxiety! The breathing tecqnique i mentioned is the easist way, and try not think about what's bothering you while you're breathing. No one will know what you're doing, so relax! Stress and anxiety are both perfectly normal! I hope this helps :)|`|nTzZsTL4aa	Get over yourself, simply.|`|AKI55c5Iaa	My best advice would be to see a psycologist. If that doesnt work, see a psychiatrist, they have GREAT drugs for anxiety!!    It doesn;t mean you're crazy if you go to a psychiatrist or psychologist. It means you take care of needs to be taken care of. You take care of what's been driving you CRAZY|`|K5IOSGXAaa	It is anxiety and it is hereditary. Try taking St. John's Wort, it works well for most and helps ease simple anxiety. It is an herbal remedy and is safer to take than prescription meds. Make sure you eat something healthy every 3 to 4 hours to keep your blood sugar level. don't use caffeine and stay away from weed, alcohol, and sugary foods. Take a good multivitamin and B50 each day, plus a fish oil capsule. And finally, breathe. Stay focused on your work in class so you aren't sitting waiting for that bell ( you are probably not breathing either and don't realize it, this helps trigger anxiety) so consciously breathe slowly if you have to.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	Your mother taught you how to worry because she shaped who you are by teaching you how to react.  You don't have to be like her, or curse your own children with it by repeating the cycle.     You are ready for a book called "Be Here Now."  It's a very different kind of book.  Even someone who doesn't like to read will find it easy to read.   Read it and learn that every moment is precious.  If we lived our lives as though we are just waiting to move on to the next thing we would never be happy.  There is nothing as wonderful as to just appreciate where we are at this moment.      In order to overcome it, change your thinking, your "self-talk" and talk to yourself in a nice way.  When you start to feel anxious think about something you're thankful for.  Even if it's just as basic as telling yourself you're thankful you aren't in any pain, because lots of other people are, or just list off things in your head you're thankful for.  That will always, always make you feel better.     If you are a "what-if..." type of thinker, change that pattern of thinking too.  Instead of saying "what if" in your head, say "how unlikely."  That will help too.      Be Here Now will take your life to a whole new level.  You can be happy in the moment.  The key to happiness and calm in your life is gratitude.  I promise.  I was once filled with anxiety too.      I'm sure you've heard this little meditation, but it never hurts to remind yourself:    God grant me the serenity to change the things I can, the courage to accept the things I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference    Here's to a new you!|`|Z1CNpLJvaa	do breathing exercises..that helped my aunt  and chill and relax|`|nJRJZqtBaa	It is not hereditary, however there are genetic tendencies for this to pop up in families.  I would try taking some deep breaths as you feel the anxiety building.  Also try picturing some calm such as a quiet morning in a field with a gentle breeze.      If the anxiety is becoming so bad that it is impacting your daily level of functioning I would talk to your doctor about maybe getting a low dose prescription med to help cope with the anxiety.    Hope this helps and good luck!
dc4df23983a4bf458df5f23d94935f89aa	i wouldn't suggest it while you've got braces, coz once you get them off, you're teeth will be discolored. wait til they come off.|`|Aq0QQnxeaa	I would wait till you get your braces off then get them professionally whitened. If you do it while you have your braces on you could have spots where your braces are.... :( not attractive... just be sure to brush really well.     You can ask your ortho next time you go in...just to be sure.|`|MzCL0dzjaa	brush with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda mixed. DO NOT USE IT EVERYDAY (like the person said above me, that's completely dumb) do it before you go to bed every other day.    You could just use hydrogen peroxide or baking soda and water but both is a great way that really whitens.    if you use it everyday eventually you'll get black hairy tongue from the lack of bacteria in your mouth.|`|f12MT3Rwaa	Hmmmm...  Brush like hell?|`|5mfiTbOiaa	yes, you can wash your mouth out with peroxide, (its that stuff in the brown bottle) it doesnt taste bad. (its h202) which is very similar to the taste of water. and it has all the same ingredients as a whitening strip would have for half the price! but only do it like twice a day for a week. because its bad for the enamel for your teeth. (it makes them sensitive) just like other whitening products.
rqvguALIaa	I could be wrong, but you might have a pimple in your nostril. I've had them a few times, and yes it hurts really bad! Look very closely and see if you can find a head where you might be able to rupture it--if you do, it's going to hurt even worse. If you can't seem to find anything, leave it alone. Touching it will just irritate it, but keep looking for a head to appear. Hope this helps...|`|f101Liydaa	a pimple maybe|`|xg4MK2JCaa	Is the weather dry? or too cold? It may be just that.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	A bonded filling is the best thing for the tooth.  A crown on that tooth is absolutely to worst idea since it removes the remaining healthy tooth structure and makes the tooth more subject to fracture.  Also, you should avoid having a post put in the tooth.  It will just lead to the future vertical fracturing of the tooth.  I think I told you this before!  OK, I'm a dentist, not a techy whiz, so I haven't figured out how to enable my email... Anyway, the most current literature and scientific studies recommend NO CROWN.   Dental schools routinely teach to put a crown on a root canal even though many text books show how it's contraindicated.  I put a link to a company that is needed to restore very damaged teeth.  The product is called Ribbond.  Many dentist don't have and are not familiar with its use.  The most recent research from Sema Belli shows that the tooth that is restored after endodontic treatment using ribbond, will regain much more fracture resistantce than no filling, amalgam, regular composite or a crown.  Please note: most dentists do not actively seek out science based seminars for their continuing education.  The trend is to continue using techniques taught in dental school, but not supported in the scientific literature.  For this reason, I am involved with a group of about 25 dentists (US and Italy) in working on a book to dispell the myths that continue to be perpetuated by dental schools.  Let me know what city and state you live in and I can see if we have a trained dentist in your area. (there are only about 140 nationwide)
RIRa9hUjaa	Caffeine does create a physical addiction, as do sugar and many other things we voluntarily ingest.    The headache is normal, and may also be due to the lack of sugar (if you add it to your latte).    You might want to just drink water for a few days.  It worked for me, though I had a colossal headache for the 1st 2 days and I wasn't even a coffee drinker at the time.  Pepsi and iced tea were my sugar/caffeine sources of choice.      FWIW, Advil, tylenol & aspirin did NOTHING to alleviate my headaches for those 2 days.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Yes, it is not mythical, it is a physical addiction. And in order to cut out caffeine from your life you need to wean yourself off it gradually or you get the bad migraine like you experienced. That will continue for days and also you can actually become physically ill like you have the flu. So do yourself a favor and start cutting back gradually and then stop. Caffeine is not good for you.|`|AA11085654	You can be addicted to caffeine.   When I had a couple medical procedures done, after the anesthesia wore off I was offered coffee.

OUjRAhaxaa	Yes!  They have the ability to monitor not only your breathing, but your leg movements (for restless leg syndrome) and your sleep patterns (which can point to physical, or psychological problems).  They will hook you up to an EEG (monitors brain waves), an EKG (monitors your heart rhythm), movement electrodes on your arms and legs (looks for excessive movement), and a pulse-oximiter (measures your oxygen levels).  They will also have a camera or a one way mirror in the room so they can physically watch you sleep to catch any other problems.

They would order more tests if they see anything suspicious on the sleep test. And I mean something that is an incidental finding. In other words if they're looking for one thing and by chance see something they weren't looking for they woul;d send you for more tests.  They can basically find if your heart has problems or whether your throst closes up. Or whether you stop breathing for long periods of time.

RvddYKqjaa	When you feel like you might vomit, put cool water on your face. Or if you are lying down, grab a cold washcloth or some ice. That helps me more than anything. You start to get warm when you are going to get sick, and the ice cools you down, and sometimes it allows the feeling to pass. It is best to let it come out of you though, but I know what you mean. No one likes to throw up. Limit what you eat. Drink a bit of Coke, without the fizz. Eat a Saltine cracker. Those are my best shots at feeling better. I think you have a bug that's going around. I really doubt you can sue anyone because of the tuna. I bet a lot of others ate it too, and didn't get sick. Just worry about feeling better.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	this is food poisoning you need to drink peppermint tea to clear your stomach from any infection and drink plenty of water|`|uOSetoXuaa	you can try staying in a position where you feel like not vomiting untill it goes away, works for me|`|J07AmW55aa	dude just try to vomit if u know u will anyway you'll feel much better|`|FyI9qlxBaa	omg i wish i knew.  i am so sorry  vomiting is my biggest phobeia, along with flying and big bugs    i would say to eat bread, but im not sure if that works or not considering i have never tried it|`|ltMbMIPlaa	sugar keeps the stomach from contracting.|`|9mzOA8dGaa	Pills are good!

Your stomach is tender, and anything heavy might come back up.  You need something light on your stomach.  That tuna is what is affecting you, not the time it took you to eat.  Usually people feeling ill from starvation don't throw up. They pass out.  You might have gotten a small stomach bug from the tuna.  go to the doctor if it does not clear up in 3 days (from start to the end of 3 days).  Food poisoning consist of throwing up a lot.    Hope You Feel Better  :-)|`|7ClnS9iaaa	Lots and Lots of water.. you will continue to throw up, but it will clean out your system and make you feel so much better... Works for me.  Oh, and as for the sandwich thing, call Subway and tell them what happened and what it tasted like. Hope you feel better! Sucks feeling sickk.|`|nkTKIXcBaa	Blech, sounds like food poisoning. Peppermint tea is probably a good suggestion, as the peppermint would ease the spasms of the intestines and stomach that cause vomitting, and isn't tea usually basic? That should raise the pH of your stomach acid, which is probably too acidic right now. If this is the case, the basic tea will make you feel less miserable. My mom used to get nausea often (we could never figure out why) and she'd eat Ritz crackers to feel better. It's worth a shot I guess, haha. If it doesn't go away by tomorrow, go to the doctor and get some antibiotics... food poisoning sucks.  Get better soon, okay? :)
QQbbReRAaa	Ok, you'll probably think I'm a bull$hit artist, but have a day a week where you gorge yourself. Just eat all the bad things you couldn't eat normally. Have lots of cakes/deep-fried foods etc. This will increase your metabolism. Your body will be going "whoa!, whats all this?!", and it'll have to work overtime to digest it all. Plus just the intake of energy will make it run faster naturally. As you said, the body reaches a plateau and tries to stay there. You need to shock it out of this plateau. Honestly, I used to be fat, and then I dieted/exercised 5 days a week, and pigged out on a weekend, and went back to the diet again etc etc, and I lost heaps of weight. You could see my ribs! (yeah, I went a bit overboard). But the idea is the bodies metabolism increases during this time, and then you take the bad food away, and it's still firing higher than usual, and it then burns the fat during this time. It worked for me anyway. And the fat you intake during your 'off' day, will be burnt up during the week. I'm gonna get a lot of thumbs down, but it worked, for me. I dropped from a 40 inch waist to a 32 inch waist. With no 'magic diets or pills', just 1 hour power walks per day, and sensible good food. You should also change your weight routine, as the body gets used to that too|`|aGRJOdR8aa	I know this won't help you, but honestly, at 5'4 and 118 lbs, that's pretty good. I'm not sure why you're complaining...|`|3SNhXpf0aa	Drinking 8 glasses of water a day, eating 5-6 small meals a day 3 hours apart, working out/exercise.|`|BZMD5jEuaa	EAT BREAKFAST if your eat in the morning it will help you alot with burnin lunch and dinner!!!

AA11853243	You are ok. The first thing you need to do is relax. Sounds to me like you are way to stressed out. My eyelids twitch when I am too stressed out.   The pain in your neck could definitely be caused by a too heavy backpack. Try a hot shower. Get in and turn the water as hot as you can stand it then let the water pour over your neck and try to relax. I'm also guessing that you are not getting enough sleep. Some people need more than 8 hours, you could be one of them.   The always being angry is probably related to your stress. Try to take some time every day just to relax. Do something you enjoy doing for at least an hour.|`|31NapKplaa	ive had that happen put a warm towel around your neck    it will relax the muscles, also try to massage it you might have a knot|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Is this just today????!!!

Teenagers go through tremendous hormonal changes and it really wreaks havoc on your emotions and mood. You have to eat, it makes it worse. You just have to eat healthy foods that aren't fattening and exercise more, get out in the sun every day that you can. Don't use caffeine and stay away from sugary foods. Eat something every 3 to 4 hours to keep your blood sugar level ( keeps your mood upbeat).|`|RIRa9hUjaa	You're THIRTEEN for God's sake!

Work with your parents to develop a healthy eating plan and STICK TO IT.  Exercise at least 3x week, preferably 5x week if you can.      Finally, RELAX.

(its h202) which is very similar to the taste of water. and it has all the same ingredients as a whitening strip would have for half the price! but only do it like twice a day for a week. because its bad for the enamel for your teeth. (it makes them sensitive) just like other whitening products.|`|542SSMXFaa	I do this remedy and its amazing every one notices.

The Vinegar kills bacteria in your mouth and helps to whiten it and the baking soda whitens and the peroxide whitens and kills bateria as well, you you will have great teeth and gums like me!! : )
OUjRAhaxaa	YES!!  As the person before me said you can die if you do not use it, more likely though you will suffer from fatigue, mental cloudiness, high blood pressure, weight gain, and a number of other possible problems that you might not immediately associate with your sleep apnea.    When you have sleep apnea you are literally not breathing for periods of time while you are asleep.  Lack of oxygen is not a good thing.  Cells die without it and while some cells can be regenerated, loose enough or go long enough with out oxygen and you are in serious trouble or dead.  Not to mention that the snoring is probably keeping everyone else in the house up.    I know that the CPAP may not look sexy, but there is nothing as un-sexy as a dead person in bed next to you.  Wear your CPAP and check with your doctor about ways to decrease your dependence on it if you just cannot stand it.  If you are overweight, sometimes just losing the weight can solve sleep apnea.  Also changing medications may alleviate the problem, but DO NOT stop using it without getting a sleep study to confirm that you no longer suffer from sleep apnea or you just may wake up dead!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	only if you don't want to die while sleeping.  follow up with your sleep doctor and DME company for specifics.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	If your doctor has found something wrong with your sleeping patterns  And if he ordered the CPAP ,machine then he wants you to use it.  It's not that big of a deal.

zddIYf9vaa	nah, its just like taking a picture with a flash but instead the flash is right next to your eye lol    they do that to both of your eyes and thats pretty much it|`|HHUSNn7iaa	Hi! I have been an optical assistant for nearly 10 years, and am married to an optician. Generally dilations are only done if the optician needs to take a better look at the back of your eye, or if for some reason he/she wants to fully relax your eye to get a better idea of the prescription. It's pretty rare for them to do this, (unless you're diabetic). And even if they were to do it the only uncomfortable bit is when they put the cyclopentalate (dilating drops) into the eye.....some people report that the drops sting a little, however this subsides within seconds. The actual process of dilation doesn't hurt at all.     The puffs of air are done to test the pressure inside the eye, and is only done on people over 40. Sometimes it's done on younger people, but as with the dilation, that's only in exceptional circumstances.  It isn't scary, but a lot of people find it a little uncomfy, although in my experience the build up is a lot worse than the actual event!     A basic eyetest involves the opticain asking you a few questions about your general health, and whether you have any concerns about your eyesight. Then it's just a case of them shining light into your eye to look at the back of it, and doing a pretty standard reading chart with you. And any decent optician will be happy to answer any questions you have about what they are doing.....it's there job to make you feel comfortable when you're in that chair, and for those 20ish minutes you should be kept well informed.   Sorry to go on! lol. Hope this helps.
jnuBYMAiaa	From what I understand, the male ejaculation feels like you're going to urinate. As you get closer and closer to orgasm, the feeling will intensify. Until you're confident to go past this without fear, you may not do so, which is normal. You won't urinate when this feeling is strong, but you'll ejaculate. The best way to ejaculate without getting caught is either into a paper towel or tissue and discard of it in your room wastebasket or bathroom, depending where you do it. If you're in the bathroom, you can turn to the toilet and deposit it there. Unless you leave a big mess on the floor of your room or the bathroom or somewhere where many people visit, you won't get caught. Most parents understand that their children do this and usually will give you your privacy if you ask for it. Hope this helps.|`|H76IjEiPaa	On your chest. The protein is good for you so dig in.|`|jxM8FRXHaa	Try doing it in a sock. That way, you don't have to worry about a messy cleanup. Just wear the sock like a glove and go for it. Then put the dirty skeet sock in your dirty clothes hamper.    Or you can make a fake vagina. Get a sock, a latex glove, and some lotion or oil. Put the latex glove inside the sock so that a little bit still hangs out. Fold the tip of the open rim of the latex glove around the outer rim of the sock. next, lubricate the glove with the lotion or oil. Insert as you normally would. The downside is that you have more to cleanup. A nasty looking used latex glove with sperm inside of it might be hard to explain to the parents, but it feels great.    If you want a "tighter hole,"use a large wash rag, fold it in half long ways, and warp it around the latex glove so that it forms a tight circle and follow the same process.|`|ICZJak8taa	in the shower|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	There is no way to explain, you must experience.|`|piI1aWOdaa	swallow it|`|4lbgJXI0aa	Feels great.

Sometimes you have to shock the body before you start seeing results. I knew a girl with an excellent regime but it took two weeks for anything to happen, then all at once she dropped 12lbs!    First check out http://www.ahealthyme.com/CalBurn.do and figure out how many calories you are burning in a day (without exercise)    Then keep a journal exactly what you are eating tedious I know, but we eat 30% more than we realize on average!)    Make sure you are balancing your diet, lots of protein, grains & veggies. Fruit for breakfast works wonders! Cut out all processed sugars to jump Start the weight loss. Replace them with natural ones then SLOWLY allow back in (if they are a must in your life)    DRINK PLENTY OF WATER! Take your weight, divide it in half and that's how many oz your body needs in a day. More is better, but no less. Also no diet soda or coffee, if you must black coffee or green tea! Your body expels fat when you go to the bathroom. If aren't hydrated enough it just goes back...what a waste when all you have to do is down some H2O!    Lastly look at your fitness plan. Are you really pushing yourself hard enough on the treadmill? Are you going at least 3 but not more than 6 days a week? Are you targeting all of your muscle groups effectively? Men seem to get the most benifit if they start with cardio (30 min or so) then do either arms and back or legs and abs. Each 3rd day so solely cardio for longer and harder than the others.     Good luck and congrats on getting healthy!
kfczDUNWaa	ummmm maybe something might happen you might still wanna get checked out. a heart attack or blood clots or even brain tumors... i hope nothing bad happens to you ! next time dont take so many!|`|43610f61e745e21fe38388296de975f9aa	I guess if nothing happened then nothing will... but in case you didnt know too many pain killers can mess up your liver... idiot.|`|C7UIZb5Haa	First you aren't  telling what was the span that you took the pills nor what were they ? So you took 9 extra aspirin I am assuming nothing would have happened unless you did cut your writs , then you would have bled to death . I guess is that what you didn't do otherwise your question wouldn't be posted . That was stupid and you are suppose to follow the direction that is !    Ok you are alive and well to talk about it but don't do again! Nice talking with you and God Bless you .|`|byoVs671aa	Really, see a doctor right away.  I had a similar experience with anti-nausea meds (I took 400mg, the limit), nothing happened at first, but a week or two later my chest started to feel strange.  My heart began to feel sore after exercise and it would race out of control when doing simple tasks.  It isn't as bad as before, but I am still having heart problems.  Even if it doesn't seem like anything at first, it will probably come back and bite you in the ***.|`|k3qKIXQ9aa	When you say PainKillers do you mean like Tylenol or Opiates?

You're in puberty, mate.    The first year is all internal. Puberty is when you start to go through the chemical, physical, emotional and hormonal changes, NOT when you ejaculate, ok? That's ONE stage along the way (and a really great one).     You should have or start getting pubic hair around your penis, balls will drop, voice break (takes about two years to get through that part), and ejaculate.     In short, you're doing fine.|`|68r4mmOnaa	As soon as your penis gets erect, puberty starts.     What day in May? I am 13 and I am on the 22nd.|`|vokUdMCsaa	i think you may have started  if you have pubic hair that means you started|`|9nDhR7xWaa	its already started..

You can take digestive enzymes that will allow you to eat and drink dairy products.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Lactose intolerance generally affects your digestive system.   You'll feel bloated and gasy; and may have cramps - although I suppose you could get headaches too:)  You might actually be ALLERGIC to cows' milk, rather than lactose intolerant.|`|37Q4QMF1aa	I do not think so, at least I never heard of anyone with LI that has these effects.|`|B3jpU4Jraa	yes you probably are that happens to me when i drink milk and eat dairy products and i am lactose intolerant|`|Vf8ADXitaa	if you stop drinking milk you naturally become lactose and tolerant. it happened to me. jus ttake lactaid before drinking milk or eating milk products|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	Those  symptoms  can  be  caused  for  many  reasons,  blood pressure,  anemic  etc.  There  are  simple  over  counter  med  for  lactose.

pfm0wcEIaa	You can go the organization's website for AIM Healthcare (Adult Industry Medical Healthcare).  As I understand it, before this organization was founded there was little or no regulation as to how often pornstars (or adult entertainers got tested).  This organization was founded by an ex-pornstar.      They required that pornstars get tested each month.  But I think they only get tested for HIV.  Meaning that everything from Hep C to chlamydia is a free for all.  And it is pretty much a given that about 99% of pornstars have genital herpes.  But then again, 3 out of 5 women have genital herpes and 2 out of 5 men have it... Imagine having that in mind while looking at a room full of people...    I hope this answers your question.|`|t0uIgY08aa	THey get tested everyday, and tested on the set its major safe.. watch one of their biography's i'm sure you can google it.|`|qf4NEOYmaa	they dont. they have STD insurance.|`|6PNuFgTJaa	They get paid more to go bareback.

I think they would've stopped caring about their bodies roughly around the time that they gave up on all their hopes and dreams.

jnuBYMAiaa	Generally if the skin is just dry and itchy, it's just chafing or dry skin. If it's a fungal infection, then it'd be irritated, red and full of bumps. First, I'd advise keeping the area moisturized with lotion, vaseline, aloe vera lotion or whatever you use. If this doesn't help, then I'd advise going to the pharmacy and getting an anti-fungal cream and this should eliminate it. If it is fungal, keep the area dry of water. After showers, dab the area dry, then apply the cream. If none of these work, see a doctor so he can prescribe the right medication to help. Hope this helps.|`|LXxIxf13aa	Benadryl, Lotion, anti-itch cream|`|2SSD6BP9aa	I'm sorry, but castration is your only option!    Or maybe you could try some anti-fungal products.  You know, if you are like, attached to your penis or something.    You should be able to find some jock itch sprays or creams at any drugstore or supermarket, right next to where they have the athlete's foot stuff.  Jock itch is basically just the athlete's foot fungus in the pubic area.|`|68r4mmOnaa	Hand lotion. Apply when going to bed. Wake up should be better. Do it 3 days in a row. Worked for me!|`|AA11966501	I would try a antifungal first
dsTVW1WTaa	Yes water can help alot.  Eat dark greens such as dark lettuce and spinach. And get plenty of vitamin A. Also, dont eat lots of sweets and anything high in fat, You are what you eat ;]  If its just one pimple your trying to get rid of [Just some extra advice] Get a Q-Tip and dab it in either nail polish remover, Or rubbing alchohol. It'll dry the pimple out and make it go away.    Other than that, Continue to wash your face in the morning and the night with your prefered acne solutions.    I like using things with little beads in them like apricot scrub or Olay.     If problems worsen, or show NO improvement in the next month, you need to go to a dermatoligist.|`|tU59wDdQaa	i used benigel and it was the best ..it worked soo good
ONooURxIaa	You just need to change how you do it.  if you want to look like an endurance runner, do long distance.  If you want to look like a running back or wide receiver you need to do interval sprint work.    Alternate between 30 second high intensity running and sprinting and 30-45 seconds of walking slowly.  This will train your heart aerobically, will burn calories better than jogging the same amount of time, and will be more inline with a muscle gain program.
z5tCcEA3aa	ive had my both tops taken out.. i did it awake.  the tops dont hurt. but my dentist tried to take out my bottoms at the same time..yea..not so easy..so they never came out. this was like last year..im going in march to get my bottoms out awake again...id rather be put to sleep..your lucky. no dentists in my town put you to sleep. dont be scared. it hurts a little after. but its not THAAAT bad.     :)

OcCgUsmLaa	Thers nothing wrong with it sweety. It won't make you fat. If it did I would weigh 400 pounds! I love the taste too and hate when a guy wastes it. Open wide and enjoy!    S|`|2SSD6BP9aa	Swallowing is not really good or bad.  There is protein and other good stuff in the semen, but you probably aren't eating enough of it to make a difference in your diet.  Unless you are sucking a lot of guys!    If the guy you are sucking has an STD, then it is possible to get it through oral sex, but it's less risky then unprotected anal or vaginal sex.  And swallowing - instead of spitting - doesn't really change the chances of getting the STD from him.  Just having his semen - or even just his pre-*** - in your mouth means you can get it if you have any cuts or bleeding gums or something like that.  But the stomach is not a route for STDs because the stomach acids will kill any virus or bacteria in it.    You shouldn't even get an upset stomach from it.  I think the girls who mentioned that, probably just said it because they think its gross or something.  I always swallow and never got an upset stomach - even after sucking multiple guys.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	It is very healthy.  It has protein and other nutrients.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Not good, not bad... the stomach acid will destroy it pretty quickly.|`|W1MgefrWaa	The only thing it will effect is your popularity. Especially if you actually like the taste. you are a keeper.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	Dear Sherry  You can acquire any number of Sexually Transmitted diseases from oral sex, such as:    Chlamydia   Gonorrhea   Herpes   HIV   Human papilloma virus (HPV)   Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU)   Syphilis   Yeast infections.    Chlamydia and Oral Sex  Oral sex is not considered a common cause of Chlamydia infection, but it is a possibility. If the vagina, cervix, anus, penis or mouth come in contact with infected secretions or fluids, then transmission is possible.   Gonorrhea and Oral Sex  Gonorrhea can be passed during oral sex (either giving or receiving). Ejaculation does not have to occur for gonorrhea to be transmitted or acquired. Gonorrhea survives well in the throat, and gonorrhea throat infections from oral sex are relatively common.   Herpes and Oral Sex  Herpes can be transmitted via skin to skin contact, so the risks during oral sex are clear. Its important to remember that transmission can occur even if there are no visible sores, and you or your partner may be infected with herpes and not know it. Some people are not aware that cold sores are a form of herpes.   HIV and Oral Sex  While the risk is considered to be low, there have been documented cases of HIV transmission where the most likely way it was transmitted was through oral sex via semen, vaginal secretions or blood. HIV is not transmitted via saliva, and deep kissing is considered a safe sexual behavior. There have been cases of oral sex transmission during fellatio (performing oral sex on a man) and cunnilingus (performing oral sex on a woman).   HPV and Oral Sex   Oral sex is considered a less common cause of HPV infection, although it has been documented. HPV virus is shed from the surface of warts and any form of direct physical contact may result in transmission.   NGU and Oral Sex   Most of the germs that cause NGU can be passed during oral sex, even if the penis or tongue doesnt go all the way in to the vagina, mouth or rectum and even if body fluids are not exchanged. A recent Australian study provided further evidence for oral sex as a transmission route for NGU.   Syphilis and Oral Sex  Oral sex is considered an efficient way to transmit syphilis, with one CDC study reporting that more than 13% of syphilis cases in a geographic area were attributed to oral sex. Transmission usually occurs during vaginal, anal or oral sex when syphilitic sores or patches come in to contact with slightly abraded skin or mucous membranes.   Yeast Infections and Oral Sex   There is evidence to suggest that women who have recurrent yeast infections may be infected by receiving oral sex. In one study, receiving oral sex had an association with an increased risk of recurrent yeast infections at three times the rate. Oral sex with someone who has a yeast infection can lead to thrush, which is a yeast infection in your throat. Oral contact with yeast will not give you a yeast infection in your vagina, because the yeast will be killed in your digestive system.|`|uIpVvT1Saa	just a little tummy ache. itll go away.|`|HBvsCZmLaa	if you enjoy it, there is no problems in doing so..  its a good source of proteen    enjoy|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	no actually if he has any type of blood born illness or STD you could still catch them.|`|AA12022261	that's kind of hoe-ish sorry :(.. i dont think so|`|VdtZKYynaa	ur gonna get huge arms from all the protein lol|`|vlki0YmHaa	Doesn't do anything.|`|c6LDiUVzaa	its fine... but aperently if ur guy eats pineaple before it will taste like it.|`|LXxIxf13aa	no not really you can't get pregnant by it that would be a physically impossibility there is no way that is can make its way through the digestion track to the ovaries|`|wFlObEjcaa	ask your mother|`|43610f61e745e21fe38388296de975f9aa	Um... not to my knowledge.

8DCWULwsaa	I agree with Justin. Better to help get the boy healthy now than to wait until he reaches a point where it's too late, like you said.|`|urCMLUlYaa	He is too young to understand that he is getting heavy.  You need to help him but I wouldn't tell him that he is heavy.  It may hurt his feelings.  Try to make it something fun to him.  Tell him how good it is to be healthy.  If you start him out young them he will have the right tools to stay healthy.|`|asX2hxFXaa	I don't think it's bad, and maybe you should get him involved so he can see how much he's taking in.  Do this:  go to www.sparkpeople.com  I love this website.  It's free. Set up a profile and start tracking calories eaten and calories burned.  You can get the calorie amounts for just about everything.    I did it for six months.  My problem isn't so much eating badly; my problem is portion control.  If I pay attention to serving sizes, my weight goes down.|`|3SNhXpf0aa	No. In fact it is recommended that you count your calories to make sure you are eating enough and not eating too much. If you keep track, you are also more likely to stick to your plan.    You are very nice to help out your step son, it is good that you are taking interest in his health. I wish my mom would work out with me =P sounds like fun, good bonding time.    Good luck and best wishes!|`|7pkxOc6Raa	No.    I wish there were more parents out there like you.     If something isn't done, your stepson will just be another obesity and diabetes statistic.|`|iXt3erseaa	It's a good idea, but check with your doctor.     However, he can certainly exercise with you - that's a nice mom-son bonding thing to do. But you may need to let him lead some of the exercising...     Make sure he gets outside every day and moves around a lot - like moves his whole body. Kids exercise by running and playing so make sure he gets lots of this.    He should not have any junk food or soda pops, for example. Even diet ones. They just aren't good for a growing body.    And make sure there are lots of fresh fruits and veggies for him to snack on. And for you too - he will learn by your example!    I commend you on wanting him to have a healthy weight - it will save him a lot of grief and health issues later on.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	I don't think it's wrong, especially if he's really becoming overweight. You're right, it's not healthy for him to be so large. And the foods that are causing him to becoming overweight probably aren't all that healthy either. I think it'd be great to get him healthy and used to good eating habits while he's young.|`|nriErV2Vaa	counting calories is not a bad thing infact it is a wonderfull thing.    more people should do it to stay healthy but if you face the facts amarica is fat|`|d66a48c5ec6368c89ec52fc95499270aaa	I was a nanny at one point in the same situation. I took the little girl to a doctor with the ok of her parents and the doctor said it is all about portion control, not necessarily putting her on a diet but just trying to cut back and maintain where she is at. Basically, at such a young age it is important to eat nutritiously. Substituting fruits and veggie snacks instead of cookies and chips is your best bet. Teach him the proper foods to eat and you can make it fun too. I wouldn't worry about calories just nutrition.

Do you have a hunchback?  To the person who's sister has it, the risks depend on how bad the curve is. My curve was so bad it punctured a lung, and I could have died.

nkTKIXcBaa	The flu shot is not going to prevent the stomach flu - stomach flu is caused by a whole mix of viruses, none of which include the influenza virus that's in the flu vaccine.   That said, stomach flu IS contagious like normal flu. You won't necessarily get sick though, the only reason the soup would be contaminated would be because of the saliva that was on the spoon your mom used to eat. Needless to say, that's not a whole lot of virus. And if you reboiled the soup to make it taste good, the virus was probably killed anyway. The chances of you getting stomach flu because of the soup are very slim. You might catch it from being around your mom though - at least some of the viruses involved are airborne.   As for over the counter pills, I can only think of immune system boosters and zinc/vitamin C supplements. I'd try some of those; I really like the kind that Halls makes (it's usually right next to the Breezers cough drops), not because they're particularly effective since I really can't tell, but because they taste good. Haha good luck :)|`|P8CBDLiKaa	You're probably fine if your mom was already sick; stomach flu is usually actually a form of food poisoning, so if your mom got sick after eating the soup, you may have issues.    In the case of infectious gastrointestinal disorders, again, you should be OK as long as you heated the soup first.    Good luck.    EDit:  the flu shot is only good against Influenza, an upper respiratory viral infection, not "stomach flu."|`|0kWkX8yiaa	umm yeah if she was sick and you ate out of the same bowl of soup...sorry hun|`|ibvRasY5aa	well i used to have the stomach virus and it was terrible let me tell ya. it all first started with some beans..i thought that was it...but then soup..still sick..and then i felt veeeery weak. so yeah i dont think im helping haha but i dont no on that...

One is denial (we all know that one), then there is anger, self-blame, guilt, anger and then acceptance--and there are no set rules how long each stage will last.    It is normal to feel depressed after a loved one has died. There is the feeling of loss in your life. Eventually, you will want that feeling to be filled with something else that is meaningful.    If you are concerned about inheriting the genetic makeup that your father had, why not relieve your anxiety by talking this over with your doctor? He's the one who should be offering you firm, solid advice that you can rely on. He's there for you, now.|`|WuxC1YBJaa	A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may demonstrate auditory hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized and unusual thinking and speech; this may range from loss of train of thought and subject flow, with sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence, known as word salad, in severe cases.

You need to call Cigna & just ask a general question using the policy you have as an "example" & ask about pre-existing conditions.  If not, speak to your MD & ask if he considers this a pre-existing condition...if not let him write you a new prescription for the sleep lab.    Good luck
