szVvf7Nkaa	Even if you were wrong or not I think the major problem is that you never really trusted this girl. And you let past experiences affect your relationship with her.  And now you are hurting because you feel that she has moved on. Or did she really moved on. Just because she is going out with this guy that doesn't mean anything. But if you love this girl then you need to get off your butt and fight for her. You say that you are afraid of being rejected and that is normal. But love is all about taking a risk. And if you don't take this risk and you find out in a few years from now that she would have taken you back then how would you feel then. Don't you want to take a risk and find out if she is willing to work things out with you? If you love her that much then you need to tell her. Tell her that you were wrong. And apologize to her for not trusting her. Come on and take the risk. Go after her and let her know how you really feel. And if she doesn't want to have anything to do with you then at least you can say that you tried. But if it does work out and she takes you back then you have to TRUST her and leave the PAST in the past.|`|m2eHPeciaa	i think u should leave the past behind u n look forward. u can't get over ne one if u look at the history u had with her. she already has a man, so let it go.|`|mMyavg8uaa	i think you should call her but be ready for both outcomes, she might want to be with you too, which is good or might reject you. Be a man and face rejection. Atleast you'll feel you gave it a shot and won't regret not calling her, later on.<br>  <br>  The fact is that you should be able to trust her if and when you're with her. If you're a suspicious person and you might just break up again, then you need to think about yourself. Don't hurt another for the sake of keeping yourself safe.|`|hWyQUVdYaa	She's with another guy because she wants to be. Your best bet is to move on. Don't call her because she is likely to turn you down.|`|i6X2JWsqaa	she doesnt love you anymore just move on as she did make her jealous too.|`|6ztG71Zvaa	oh josh,josh,josh! you have been a silly lad haven't you?<br>  Call her and ask her to meet up with you over lunch or something and tell her how you feel! explain to her how sorry you are about the whole thing and tell her how the past has effected you!... be honest now and hopefully she may still feel the same. if you do get back together then you will nedd to go to councelling to get over your past!<br>  don't let love pass you by, if she is the one then you need to talk to her! if she does not feel the same way move on!<br>  I really really hope this works out for you matey, you sound like a really nice guy just one who has been silly!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA12126891	move on, join gym and work. thats what i did and i sustained. keep yourself damn busy my friend|`|H5v4FwiJaa	Well you are the one who kicked her out of your life, for no fault of hers...<br>  now leave her alone...let her live her life the way she want. In fact, even if u try and to get her back...do u think u can spend ur life with a girl who loved another man and and spent so much time with him? you are just jealous and regretting for what u have done. your problem is that u dont have a life. make your life worthwhile, find another girl...and move her...<br>  please dont ruin this girls life again... let her get on with this. <br>  But i guess there is no harm in u apologising to her if u ever a chance.|`|glkbx4B4aa	my opinion would be: don't move on, because she obviously means so much more to you than just some girl you dated. coming from a girl's point of view here, several girls date other guys just to get over the previous one. it doesn't mean she has serious feelings for the guy she has now. if you are scared of being rejected, just go up to her in person when you can and let her know how you feel and that no matter what she says, your feelings for her won't change. if you move one, could you really deal with letting someone special go? i mean, it's really up to you.

Sounds to me like he is just extremely outgoing and enjoys interacting with other people.  <br>  Have you ever thought of joining in on it and see how he reacts?  Instead of being a stuffed shirt and getting all uptight, just roll with it and try to get in on it too. You might like it, OR he might NOT like it when YOU do it and stop.  Either way, you have nothing to lose by trying! <br>  You should not keep trying to control him so much - sooner or later he will get tired of it.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	He obviously doesn't respect you much if he is clearly flirting with other women in front of you........He sounds like one of those guy's that's "all about me" and wants to be the centre of attention......|`|aa04f7927ab71de6337c1691db125f73aa	Wow..get rid of him and give it to me..I'm proud of this guys. <br>  They doesn't deserve the reserved ones.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	I say give him a dose of his own medicine|`|aI1z8bQeaa	Communicate how you feel, depending on how he reacts make your choice.<br>  <br>  But first think this through, as females sometimes we can over analyze things.

I'm sure you don't need anymore added stress on your life. If you can control it be picky, don't let relationships control you.<br>  If he realizes his mistake and apologizes, then move on.|`|iL3mNX68aa	some people are just like that.  Its just a personality incompatibility, sure it might be annoying but he's probably just being friendly.

You aren't his mommy and you're not his maid, if he doesn't pull his share of the load then he needs to make enough money to hire a maid to clean up after him.  Some people need a firm kick in the *** to get them motivated, sometimes more than one to keep them motivated, he sounds like one of those people.  If he can't handle this, it's best that you know before you make a long term commitment to him.|`|Vo5f090Waa	well how about you reward him with little things. you know what I mean. Men are like dogs, I know i am one. When your dog does something good you give him a treat, use that same principal on him.

Then someone new comes along, pays them some attention, makes them feel good again....relights the spark if you will.<br>  <br>  After that it comes down to the moral compass of the person involved, whether they pursue the new relationship (see how long it lasts!), use that spark to rekindle what they have with their spouse, or decide to change their lives in a more fulfilling and personally satisfying way without abandoning their family.<br>  <br>  For some people it can be a real eye-opener and makes them realise what is important to them (spouse, family) and that they have spent far too much energy on things which really are not important to them (lover, job).  Depends how deeply the person is capable of thinking.  If they can sort themselves out and learn from the experience then that has to be good, but too many people (in my opinion) just think the new love is the answer and off they trot to pastures new...which very quickly turn into pastures old, and the whole sequence is repeated again.|`|ZaO65qpBaa	A million reasons that all boil down to just one.The person who does it has a problem with themself.

They weren't lieing when they said that. It takes constant work to keep a marriage strong and Constant re-evaluation.

8oG3Jsk4aa	might be age factor. 2 to 3 times a month may be ok in 50's or even older. but if you are young or middle aged couple, then you should talk to your man openly and tell him  you want it more and only from him he would not mind and should be thankful for having a loyal wife like you. encourage him to go through a medical checkup (men don't want to admit their weakness especially in regard to sex) and enhance his sexual desire by some vitamins prescribed by your physician according to his condition. <br>  <br>  all the best....<br>  seeing your correction of age, i wonder what kind of boy is he who prefers his hand on his young horny wife....<br>  <br>  its normal for your age to want sex more & even more. you should get it to stay helathy... <br>  PS. all of us wants to have it as much as possible this is human need.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I think its him who has the problem. Your both 20 years old and he has sex that infrequently? Thats very odd indeed. Maybe its time you two had a chat about your needs and if he's not willing to change then perhaps you should get a divorce and find a man who can pleasure you more often. You might want to have a chat with a therapist about your urges, even for a horny guy like me  that does seem to be a bit much.|`|eQENZXz1aa	i would go crazy if my other only wanted it 3 times a month so i feel your pain ...well if i was in the same position i would thankfully not tho|`|AA12135516	It's unusual for a young male not to want sex very often so i really think the problem lies with him. Has he got any problems or seem stressed about anything that you know of?<br>  <br>  Try & pick the right time & have a talk to him about it but make sure you let him know you are not criticizing him & you love him heaps but you are concerned.<br>  <br>  You are young & have your whole marriage ahead of you so make sure you are always honest & keep the lines of communication open. Good Luck!|`|U3tZzGlgaa	Once to three times a month is too infrequent unless he's over 50.  I think the problem lies with your husband not wanting it enough.  Talk with him about trying Viagra.  You're probably going to have to try extra hard in seducing him.  Find out what gets his motor running.  ( I let my wife know what sort of things I like to see her wear.)  Maybe try younger-looking hair-styles or outfits.  Find out what his fantasies are.|`|FzFSzilmaa	nothing unnatural at all...<br>  <br>  sounds like you need a booty call or friends with benefits...<br>  <br>  can't your husband keep up with you???<br>  <br>  (and you can't force your husband to give it to you more, so you are stuck or you need to leave the relationship!!!)|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	What a pity.  You know what most men are going through with their wives.  So tell all the women you know how frustrating it is and maybe coming from a woman they'll understand how frustrating it is for us guys and our unmet sexual needs.  <br>  Back to your question.  If you don't want to leave your man, you don't want to cheat, and you don't like "doing it yourself", then you have to find a way to make him want it more.  If you're not in the best of shape try working out a little, firm up and dress sexy.  Play peek-a-boo with him.  Don't let him see you naked except during sex but tease him by letting him see you in your bra and panties, show off a little.  Touch him more, you don't have to grab his private parts but initiate contact with him.  A little squeeze of the leg or tug of his ear, just let him know you're there.  See if these things help.  Good luck.|`|xFGRYMY3aa	Of course you want it!!! If you only get it 3 times a month!!!

bpvzeYnCaa	I agree with the other poster. You should pick a very special song w/ your new hubby & then dance another song with your grandfather. One of the songs we danced to was "too long" for my tastes & ran about 6 minutes. My brother clipped it for me & faded it out using his computer. Apparently most computers have this program so a friend could probably help you with it if you feel any of your songs are too long. <br>  <br>  My husband & I danced to Aretha Franklin's "Son of a Preacher Man" (as he is a minister's son) I didn't dance a specific song with my father but we did dance during the wedding. Congrats & best of luck to you!|`|FAv1RYe6aa	You would definitely choose 2 songs. Your first dance and song would be with your husband, after that is over, the announcement would be  "it's now the Grandfather & Granddaughter dance".  I think it would be very nice to sit with your Grandfather and have him pick out the song with you, this will make him feel more involved and very pleased that you have asked him.<br>  Good luck my dear, I have 4 boys who are grown and had done 2 of their weddings.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	you should do two different songs it doesnt matter with the transition as long as the songs are special, i'll be dancing to Tangle up in You by Staind with my future husband as our first dance and then for my father daughter dance my dad picked When you wish upon a star, the version sung by jiminy cricket|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	6 minutes is a long first dance. What about having your dj shorten it a little and then pick a different song for your gpa.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	sorry to hear about your Dad.  you pick one song as your first dance as husband and wife.  the sentiment and lyrics of that song are specific to you as a couple.  then the DJ will say 'the bride will now dance with her grandpa' and he'll put on another song that you pick.  maybe the groom can dance with his mom to that song also.|`|Mlkd5Ig4aa	I agree with the other posters - 2 separate songs.  My niece's father had not been in the picture since she was a baby and my father (her grandfather) took on the "father" role with her.  At her wedding, he "gave" her away and she danced with him to "Grandpa" by the Judds.  Not a dry eye in the entire place.
9aSmQpZ3aa	no they're usually pedophiles on it|`|OZrdXQMyaa	Never been on one.|`|FzFSzilmaa	nope... they are a waste of time and money...<br>  <br>  i get loads of attention from women, right here...|`|eVcx52dAaa	I've used online dating for a total of 2.5 yrs now and the only one I would strongly recommend is LoveRecruiter.com. They are one of the few online dating sites I've come across that are actually totally free. Kind of like eharmony I guess, but without the fees. I've met two matches through them already and both were great. I've given money to paid dating sites before and never met anyone worth dating.
Y7PMeSY3aa	Yeah of course there is. Hopefully you will have learned from this experience, or in your next relationship you will learn again. I have layed on the pavement, crying, begging someone to take me back before. I told myself I would never lower myself that much again. When my next boyfriend split up with me, he did a bit of begging to get me back, and then it was all confusing and when he didn't want me, I wanted him. I sent a couple of begging text messages saying I couldn't live without him and all that rubbish but then I thought he doesn't want me I aren't lowering myself or letting myself get into the state that I did before. So although in a sense I didnt change in the relationship (I let them treat me like a princess, but I was still moody and awful with them) I changed in the way that I coped with the break up. Being emotional is not a bad thing. You will change and learn without even realising that you have. Good luck honey :-) x x x|`|c041cf42cbef03916007536215ce6e9faa	I think to some degree everyone would say, They changed after a Break Up w/ someone they had deep feelings for. However, I  must say, Despite what the situation is, or what you did, Your first responsibility must be to yourself. You state you are a weak person and overly emotional. These two things are not necessarily a bad thing, yet People will take advantage of your Kind Personality. It is essential for you to learn to look out for Yourself FIRST. If this guy wants out, Let him go...Act as if it doesn't bother you at all, ( Although on the inside it might), Play your Poker Face.

She really shouldn't talk like that. How about telling her the same? I mean letting her know that whatever she's speaking isn't very kind. At times, it happens when people throw in harsh remarks because they think it'd be funny (of course, it's not!) I have a friend who used to do the same but when I talked with her it turned out that she was just cracking lame jokes...<br>  If that friend of yours doesn't stop saying this, it's time for a new friend...<br>  You can always do without such 'friends'...lol<br>  Hope that'd help..   ^_^|`|eeadfa83863691e265325eb89a9885b7aa	My advice really depends on how important this person is to you. What was your friendship like before this behavior of hers began? Have you been friends for  very long time?<br>  <br>  If you're new friends (like, say, within the past six months), then I would spend less time with her. If you have other friends who don't treat you this way, I can't imagine why you wouldn't do things with them instead. Even spending time with yourself is so much better than having someone so negative in your life who makes you feel bad.<br>  <br>  But if you're old friends, and you share good memories with this person, then I suggest simply asking her, "Hey why are you being so mean? Did I do something or say something to make you feel like you have to treat me like this?"....or something like this. Get to the heart of the issue -- IF this friendship is important to you, then you have to at least make an effort to mend it.<br>  <br>  Good luck - hope it works out for you both.
fAaLjlI0aa	That would depend on the denomination of the Priest. Not all Priests are Catholic, by the way, Cheh.|`|3ctchU2faa	If you mean that a priest can get married to a divorced woman, then no. A priest is married to God technically, and takes a vow of chastity, disallowing him to have sex ever.<br>  <br>  If you mean can a priest marry a divorced woman to another man, the answer is yes. As long as the woman got an annulment, which means that the marriage no longer exists in the eyes of the church. She is then free to marry whomever she choses, and a priest can marry them.|`|wQNxZHsVaa	It depends what faith the ceremony is being celebrated as... as a Catholic I know that it's far unlikely for this to happen in the church twice let alone with the same priest/pastor!<br>  <br>  Although, you could pull a Henry the VIII move and decapitate whomever says you cannot divorce and remarry. Make your own religion!
d8fSVX23aa	Only if your first marriage was annulled. Which is a religious divorce as such, with statements being taken from both sides and witnesses to the marriage and the reasons for marrying. It doesn't matter if your ex beat you or was unfaithful, you married them for better or worse, only if the reasons that you stood in front of God on your wedding day to be married were the wrong reasons will they allow an annulment. It took me 18 months and ￡300 for the fees of the annulment.<br>  <br>  I take it your question is about the priest marrying you and your new partner, not a priest marrying as they are never allowed to.|`|3ctchU2faa	See answer to your other (though the same) question.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	yea|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Depends on the religion you are talking about.  Catholic Priests aren't supposed to unless the church (not the State) annulled the marriage and they (Catholic Church) can be tough in granting the annullment.|`|85xPtPQcaa	marrying a divorcee has nothing to do with being a priest or watever, we are all humans
FigFYhVlaa	i'm trying to answer it in a different approach. take it easy(i know it's hard) consider ur mother as an individual, not just she is a mom. back in 70s she probably had a different mind set and did that. but did u notice that she stopped after only 3 shoots? doesn't that give u a hint that she decided to not to do it anymore? may be those tapes are the results of a wrong/whimsical decision made by her then. every person has some incidents in life which are not pleasant while revealed by their son/ daughter. in most cases they remain secret. unfortunately, u came to know ur mom's. no big deal. <br>  and don't worry abt ur frds. i'm sure they r all bz with latest porns. so....relax.|`|qIgzwUp9aa	EEWWWWWWWWWWW i feel your pain!!!!! :'O <br>  chances are, unless you point out that its your mom or your mates are creepy porn addicts, you should just be okay!<br>  but oh my god if i were you..i would never mention or think about it again.<br>  JUST NO.|`|ljFc4gbTaa	nasty mother. anyway, past is past. im sure she's regreting. just get over it.<br>  (whoa! lucky my mom is from a conservative chinese family. she hadn't had sex until she married my dad w/c is when she was 32.)|`|MiVspyt9aa	I am sorry.don't worry!!I This is hard for any one...<br>  I am damn sure no one looks for old 70's...<br>  Don't worry,,,,|`|aLwrpMPXaa	It's hopefully in her past and she doesn't owe you any explanation.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Anybody know the links if it is?

Rkik3eUuaa	well, i met my current hubby when he was 48. he fell in love with me like  a teenager. and took me with all my 3 children and takes care of me and bought for all of us a house. we have been married for several years and he is still in love as a teenager, he is more than 50 now, i stopped counting when he turned 50. so my answer to u - love conquers all ages, u can not be too old to love. and judging your bf's behavior i should say he never was into u, children or no children. my current husband also had been married once before me and has 2 daughters from previous marriage. it has never stopped him from moving with me or marrying me.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	And similar to 111, I met my wife when I was 48.

I never thought I was going to meet someone as special as she is.

He had the ideal excuse before, to not move in with you, that each of you had a young child.  Truth is, he just didn't want to and now that he doesn't have any excuse he has been forced to tell you this.<br>  <br>  I think he's just not into a proper committed relationship and i'm very sad for you that you've wasted so many years with him.  Yes you have shared a lot but to most people your relationship wasn't normal.  It's a very strong sign that it wasn't right as there had been no progression in 12 years ! <br>  <br>  I think you ought to really make a huge effort to fill your life with other friends, hobbies, activities during this painful time.  It may be that your partner realises just how big a part ofhis life you are.  Back off and let him see that you don't need him (this will be very hard to do, but being upset, at home, waiting, clingy, just isn't going to help at all). <br>  <br>  Who knows, it could end up that he sees you getting on with your life, and wants you and by the time this happens you'll have realised that your relationship was inadequate and you won't want him.

And when you are, seek to end the situation with your boy friend and his sister or the end your relationship with your boy friend.|`|h1j1KPzJaa	siblings should NOT look at each other in a sexual way!. many will herass each other, as for myself, I would feel comfortable snaping my sister with a towel ( while she is clothed) in response to her running her mouth, but NEVER touching directly.|`|3GicGF5Taa	well its strange never the less  there had to have been some type of trauma when they were younger but just because he gets angry doesnt mean that he is involved sexually with her i smell jelousy from you honey|`|DzUxBehhaa	no, they don't mess around. maybe have a peek when they're 5, but that's about it.|`|AA12077420	It's not common|`|Or4cqOQ3aa	its not common for siblings to mess around unless their very young! and even then i can imagine parents would tell them to not touch eachother like that i don't know how old your boyfriend is but i really hope thats not why him and his sister fight
mbfMYmzWaa	It might not seem like it, but you're better off in the long run than this other girl. <br>  <br>  It sounds like she's just one of those 'generic' girls that everyone likes; lemme guess... she's funny, thin, pretty smart, always nice, can go from complete glamour to 'one of the boys' in an instant, and basically- on the surface there's just NOTHING wrong with the woman?<br>  <br>  Well, the fact is- while everyone falls 'for' her- She's going to find it extremely hard to find a deep connection with another person, because so many of what she relies on to keep her relationships are just "generic" characteristics. It's hard to explain... lol... look at it like this, <br>  SHE is like a MacDonald's cheeseburger & fries; EVERYONE likes a cheeseburger, it's got all the qualities of a good tasting feed... but lets be honest now, it's never going to be somebodies all time favorite, except those with reeeeally average taste. <br>  <br>  YOU on the other hand, are a home-cooked special recipe sanga- <br>  Some people might try it and be like "Blurghh wtf bro! did you put sauerkraut & pineapple in there?!"  But the fact is, it's got all the ingredients that make it the absolutely perfect, unbeatable mother of all sandwich for someone oneday. Something they'd chose over maccas anyday.<br>  <br>  Everyone is created equal... it's just the preportions are different, some people are more smart than hot... some are more socially aware than mathematically gifted... but even 'bad' characteristics like anger and sadness can be seen as positives (like "passion" or sadness is like "depth") by someone if they're with the right person. lol. <br>  <br>  I don't know if it's making sense (I'm WAY overtired), but my point is- even though it's frustrating now- when it comes to more than just a 'crush'... you two are on equal grounds. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't try to become like her.. you'll only lose yourself and end up with your identity all muddled up... if not broken completely. Besides, you never really know what it's like for her, or what's going to happen down the track to either one of you. <br>  <br>  lol...

And if you want a guy, you should not walk beside your friend. Try to avoid her while you are trying to approach the guy. You'll find your one, never give up. This might be just temporary. Sometimes, we feel like we are outta luck, it happens a lot. But no worries. We've been there - done that. Even if it was a different situation. We run out of luck sometimes. So chin up. You'll find the right guy. At least she didn't steal them from you. It just happened. Don't worry, gorgeous.|`|EDMAqIcBaa	be yourself and not like her <br>  the right guy will come and he'll like you for you :)<br>  try and meet people places that you know she wont be able to talk to them<br>  dont give up, there will be plenty of guys who will like you and not her<br>  good luck!|`|bflLJQhyaa	awww , that totally sucks. maybe have a talk to your new friend and tell her about it. or maybe you should just not let her no when you ask someone our or like someone!?

pzLDXL6gaa	It'll probably just take more time, sorry, because it was a long relationship. If you think it's really depressing you, then you might need counselling.<br>  <br>  Usually it's best to stay away from the ex but if you think contact with him would help you, then try. But it might just make you more upset.<br>  <br>  Honestly it sounds to me like the reason he broke up was because he wanted something more (live-in commitment type thing) and you didn't.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|BA3y6MBlaa	I can think of something bad about him.  He really, really hurt you very badly.  I'm sure he's a great guy, but maybe because you were so elusive and unattainable, you became this quest and having gotten you the thirll was gone.  THat's a terrible thing to say huh?  I'm sorry.  I can't think why else after 4 years he would do such brutal thing to you and your family.  Rest with a smile on this...Karma baby.<br>  <br>  He's not the winner you think he is...and his character will not let him excel forever..<br>  <br>  I'm glad you are back out there again.  It'll just take time until you figure out that you're bored with being sad, your bored and sick and tired of feeling sorry for yourself (no offense, I myself enjoy this particular activity from time to time), there is no payoff.  And really and truly, if he showed up in a limo with roses and reservations at Le Expensive Fu Fu Restaurant, yeah go, heck yeah, rack it up boy, but you would realize your heart is too precious for that kind of man.  Please don't waste too much time grieving..you know your pretty wonderful all by yourself.<br>  <br>  I had a similar experience...a virgin, good Catholic girl, and this handsome 10 year older man kept asking me out...I think after 17 times, I thought, wow, he really likes me.  I did alot of what you did, and then he brutally hurt me similarly...I cried for a week like a freakin baby it ached and hurt so badly...the worst pain I've ever felt in my life except maybe when my dogs have died.   I then calculated how to get him back.  I got in better shape, played head games, made myself irresistable, and got him back...when he proposed the magic was gone...I got him back...he loved me again.  But I didn't and could never love him like I did.  We married and I walked down the Isle at Pebble Beach knowing I was making a mistake.  Anyway.  I'm with husband #2 now....

AA11375099	Define attractive.<br>  <br>  why would'nt they be?<br>  <br>  You put yourself out there and then get upset if people notice you?  That does not make sense.  A beautiful flower is admired by all, and admiration is to be expected.<br>  <br>  I am sure you are nice in how you let them know you are not interested, and it appears you are tiring of it.  But that is all you can do, it is a compliment to your beauty.<br>  <br>  There is a rule of thumb for attraction:<br>  <br>  If a person rates themselves between 1-10 with 10 being beautiful and 1 not so...<br>  <br>  A person ideally will not go 1.5 away from how they see themselves.  For instance visually you are an 7.  You would not go with anyone below a 5.5 and anyone higher than a 8.5.<br>  <br>  This formula is the standard but the problem is everybody rates themselves higher than they are and get their hopes crushed.<br>  <br>  And you can't say, "Look at me, I'm a 9 why would I ever think about going out with you a 4.5, see your mistake?"|`|GvgmSxdCaa	JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS CONTENT AND NOT BY IT'S COVER... <br>  <br>  LOOKS FADE OVER TIME BUT A PERSONALITY LASTS FOREVER.|`|U3tZzGlgaa	Ugly men are going to avoid attractive women with bad personalities, unless their asking to get insulted and treated like they have the plague.  Although, they will probably ask out ugly women, they are still going to want a shot at the attractive ones.  They hope that their good personality will overcome their lack of good looks.<br>  <br>  The good looking guys are probably used to the women hitting on them, so they find less of a need to get proactive.  Which leaves the attractive women with the uglier guys hitting on them more.|`|UZBULUuraa	I once dated an attractive girl who said she like bad boys and I was not bad enough for her.

If he says no ( i don't think he will) you are embarrassed for a couple of games of bball and then its should go back to normal. But if he says yes then you two should go out and take about stuff that you two have in common. Good luck. I'm sure he will say yes.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	I'm a girl, and I can only answer from a girls perspective...

AA11682594	okay if your hubby feels that he has a need to unwind for an hour then let him without making any fuss about it. when he returns home then he will be relaxed enough to listen to you and help you out. i understand where he is coming from i was like that when i was a young parent and i didnt understand what was happenning. i failed to appreciate my wife and we split. if you can get him to relax then he will listen and understand and start to appreciate you and will be better for both of you and your child.<br>  yes you should be able to relax as well, and he should be there for the baby too, not just for the fun times.<br>  as far as him being an alcoholic is concerned then if he has 2 or 3 beers then no he's fine but if he comes back drunk a lot then its not fine. i have lived a long life drinking 4 or 5 beers a night and am definitely not an alcoholic. good luck with your marriage and remember calm talking is better than furious splitting.|`|AA11297232	He should at least take care of the baby for an hour or so. Just because he is working does not mean that he does not have a responsibility towards the baby and you as well. Heyyy, looking after babies and cleaning the house, cooking etc is hardwork en you don't get paid. I feel if more fathers take the kids of the mothers hands for a while to give her a break their would be less child abuse incidents as well. Mothers need a break as well, not just the fathers.|`|a9hsthv4aa	I don't think you are being selfish at all, what he doesnt seem to realise is that raising a baby is also a full time job, didn't a government survey say that if it were a paid job then stay at home mom would be one of the highest paying because of all the effort and work involved? It's a shame that the 'moms on strike' programme is no longer around...it showed fathers like that how it really was to stay at home, look after children...clean the house etc and they all realised it was a lot harder than their jobs. The best thing to do if have a long conversation about it, get someone, say a close relative to have the baby for an hour or so, that way you and your husband can sit down and talk it through without getting too stressed about the baby being involved. That way you can explain everything that you are feeling to him, and if he is a good husband he will listen and try to take on board what you have to say, but either way he should be there for you and baby in more than just the bread earner way otherwise he might not bond properly with your child. xxxxx good luck xxxxxxx|`|fAaLjlI0aa	No, you are not wrong to ask him for help. He is a parent too, regardless of how "stressful" his job is to him, he still has responsibilities. Your work is every bit as stressful as his, believe it. He needs to quit being selfish and man up. The baby isn't going to be a baby for very long, and he needs to help you care for him while he is, and then for the rest of his childhood as well. Parenting is a two person job in your marriage and it's high time he does his share, work or no work. He can have his time to unwind, but you need your own time too. Tell him this. Don't let him guilt trip you or refuse. This is his child too. <br>  <br>  As far as the drinks: does he drink every day? He may have an alcohol issue, which may contribute to his refusal to give that up.|`|AA11656632	He needs to help you more. Especially with his own child. Remind him that being a Mom is a 24/7 job & you need a break too. Schedule a night out with your friends & let him stay home.

yd2SP7d6aa	Teach our children to be less selfish, greedy, to consider the thoughts / feelings of others, and to be responsible for their own actions.  By the time people are 18 (adults), they are already set in their ways and "counseling" is pretty much a waste, you got to catch them when they are young.<br>  <br>  It also wouldn't hurt for people to actually "date" for a lengthy period of time before jumping into sex (if at all) until you either marry or have an agreement (fiance) to marry.  Sex clouds peoples judgements and forms attachments.  It's hard to break away from a person who is a BAD fit as a partner when you have already put out (attachments have been formed and chemicals in your brain that lead to attachments / feelings of love have been disbursed).<br>  <br>  Of course, in our sex crazed culture, thats probably asking for to much.  People seem to hold to the opinion that simply because you CAN, you should.|`|UZBULUuraa	If a person must marry, then they need to learn compromise. I also think people should have long engagements where the lust and passion have worn off. If love remains, then they are more likely to stay together. So many people get married while the lust and newness are still present in the relationship. When that goes away there is nothing left. Sex alone cannot sustain a relationship.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	A friendship is what holds a marriage together in my opinion. Marry after the initial attraction wears off. Take classes at church.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	don't get married|`|GTywb907aa	well i think that to many people rush into marriage to quickly.People must take time to get to know each other first even if that means dating for longer.Sometimes unexpected things happen were a girl will fall pregnant and people force them to get married.I think that commitment doesn't have to mean getting married and living together it should mean being responsible and mature to handle any situation,also many people get married for all the wrong reasons .That's why the divorce rate is so high it's because people need to think logically and understand that marriage is a sacred union of to people.And people need to be educated about these things.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Well that's an easy one. The answer has nothing to do with age, nothing to do with how long you've known one another. In order to lessen the divorce rate, we need to bring back values and respect. The media is constantly barraging children with stories of celebrities changing spouses almost as often as they change their clothes. People don't honor the covenant of marriage, they don't teach their kids to honor it either. They don't teach their kids that marriage isn't just a piece of paper, it's something to be treasured and cared for. You shouldn't get married if you're not prepared to spend the rest of your life with that person. You shouldn't get married because someone else wants you to (parents, family, etc) or because you got pregnant, or for convenience. You should only get married when you know that this person is it for you, that you can't imagine being with anyone else, and this is the person you want to spend your life with. And then get a grip on reality and realize that after the wedding is over, a marriage is something that takes care and work and effort and respect and consideration. More marriages would work if people put half as much effort into their relationships as they do into advancing their careers or one-upping the Jones'.|`|X5VEAY4Maa	Stop thinking about what we want ourselves think about the other person. Communicate! That is the number one key! Sacrifice is number two. You cannot do the things you were doing when you were single, you are not single anymore. Everything you did to get that person to love you you do not change that once you get married. For example: Keep yourself in shape, Do not be lazy, Try new things, you cannot say you do not like something you have never tried.Love that person for who they are and do not try to change them! Remember that is the person you did fall in love with. The only thing that changes is the " I " to " WE ". You have to know you are not single anymore.

Those should be cleared to go through straight to court without counseling.<br>  <br>  Someone suggested raising the marriage age to 28, but 21 should work just fine as well. And the couple should see a counselor for at least a year (maybe during the engagement) to see if they really are compatible and to make sure that they realize the seriousness of marriage.|`|AA10248966	People could have a waiting period of one year to see if they actually like one another as poeple and friends, rather than reproduction machines,<br>  <br>  <br>  People marry for many reasons, outlined on this board.

4df38127832d990b4b24f92289463660aa	I'm sorry to hear about you father. You don't mention whether you had a close relationship or not.You make a point that he isn't a father figure straight away, almost like a defense. I had a relationship when I was 22 with someone who was 39, I didn't feel the age gap mattered but it didn't last for that reason, feelings change and fade over time, you'll grow in ways you can't imagine now, I'm 10 years older now and I can't see what that 22 year old saw in that 39 yr old. When things are new we find it hard to rationalise, to see the long term view for what it is. For all sorts of reasons you know this relationship is full of complications - firstly he is a member of your family, I suspect your family are already raw from the loss of your father, I think your mother would find this very difficult to deal with. 32 years age difference is my whole life time and if you did decide to pursue this and lets say you go against everyone else's wishes and pursue this relationship in 20 years you'll be 42 and he will be 74, he is certain to die years before you, which is heart ache in itself. If you can take a step back perhaps you should try, you have your whole life ahead of you, you're probably grieving, I suspect he is too (after all it was his brother) - does he have a partner? at 54 I would be surprised if he didn't? does he have children? your cousins? this sounds like a painful road you're taking, don't confuse your need for nurture for romantic love|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Well, what you have done is totally wrong, but if you think you are happy and do not care about others, and would like to continue. May be you are not plan to marry him but just have relationship with him, in your mind you just want some one to love and care for you. Since you are already 22, I think you know best what you should do. No body can give you advice unless you yourself wanted to listen to the advice.

There is no undue force or influence inflicted on either of you to take this step & hence it is a fit case to be decided as an exceptional case to grant you decree of divorce on mutual consent now.<br>  Provided you engage sensible lawyer to properly handle the case.|`|jp5lfmzTaa	Divorce would do you good.

Her behavior is wrong and I think you already know that. Reading your story really broke my heart that she would speak to your family in this way, because I don't even get the chance to meet and speak with my husband's family. I was kept away and never allowed to meet them. After seven years of marriage I think they don't know that he married me. They are in India and we stay in USA. (there is more to that story but won't trouble you with it here). I would never dream of being so rude to them like that. I know my limits in life. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like her family might be a bad influence on her, and if that is the case, you will get nothing but problems. Even if you have kids then the grandparents will be filling your kids' ears full of bad things about you. That's bad. <br>  <br>  And even to be rude to your sister that just made me so angry when I read that. I don't even have a sister and I want one so badly in life.  I think she is taking everything for granted. Marriage is not just between the two of you, it's between the two families also. Why can the families not put the happiness of the couple as a first priority and forgive and forget and make things work out. But it doesn't sound like that is going to happen. <br>  <br>  And I cannot even imagine this thing that if you have a kid that she won't let that kid see your family. That is so wrong. Children are people, they are not property! My husband wants kids and I am against it for the opposite reason, I want to meet his family. This should have happened a long time ago. I don't want to raise any child that doesn't know his grandparents. That's just wrong.  She is 100% wrong on that statement of keeping a child away from his or her family like that. <br>  <br>  Did she find someone else, is that why she wants to run away so quickly? A marriage is a commitment, it's not a shopping trip where you search for the best deal. It sounds to me like she thinks she made a mistake and is looking for any excuse. Just tell her openly if that's what she wants, let her have it. If she is not committed there is nothing you can do about it. You cannot force her to feel committed. In the end she will end up back at your door and put you through more torture if you take her back. She needs to make her choice and stand by it. <br>  <br>  Sorry for my anger at her but I don't even get a chance to have relations with my husband's family and it just makes me bitter when someone else has a chance and purposefully ruins it like that. And sorry for my rambling answer but feel free to send me a message anytime brother, I am there to help you.|`|EJWphb88aa	save your life from this pathetic so called wife of urs and also their DUMB HEAD family..

Don't lose more self respect by going down SO much to save the marriage.<br>  <br>  2. DOn't forget that she is the loser not you. If she being girl, she has soo much disinterest on saving marriage, Just image what she should deserve in future....???<br>  <br>  3. Just keep quite for few weeks/months and don't speak to her or her parents about it. The more importance you show for them, the more they will be firm in yielding for your request.<br>  <br>  4. After giving some gap, try speaking to her. If you fail to speak to her then speak to her parents or send them a mail/letter. If you don't get any positive response then you propose to get divorce.<br>  <br>  5. Take a break after divorce and start looking for a new partner. LEF does not edn at devorce.<br>  <br>  6. Always reember to handle this inceident as a MAN and never give up the integrity of your family while resolving thisissuess. Good luck my freind...!!!|`|WYgHniyXaa	Fak that.

Dont you feel you have done enough already?|`|1ARr5RXlaa	HI buddy,<br>  It is nice to see ur commitment towards marriage and putting all sort of efforts to patch up with her family. Things will sure work if u talk to her ALONE and make her understand that u LOVE her. It is all about she being insecure with you and ur family. <br>  In india, it is not new that girls try to pull away her husband from his parents. And mostly the girls mother will be the root cause for this. Unfortunately mothers words are gods words for these silly girl. where as mother doesnt realise that she is spoiling and screwing up her daughetrs life thinking that she gives some great advice.<br>  Secondly, for heavens sake, dont go down too much in front of them. You do have some self respect and she has to respect ur parents. what ever be ur activities with other girls (good or bad), she cannt blame ur parents or sis for that. Never say u will do anything to make her happy. Belive me, then ur life is screwed for ever if she starts living with u on that commitment.<br>  Dont take any of the relatives to mediate in this. Send a msg to her thro a good frnd of her and ask for talking alone for some time. More than assuring her abt property and other things, tell her she should trust you and relationship is built on trust and not on papers. Like she putting conditions, u can also put straight the points on ur side. Make it clear that she has to accept ur parents and be part of the family. Tell her that u know ur parents for past 20+ years and know her for only less than a year. <br>  These problems do arise in most arranged marriages. I do agree that u need to be bit fliexible to make her happy. But nver give up ur self esteem. flexibility is mutual. She could hv questioned you are asked to meet the girl along with u to enquire what is there betwen the girl and you. But unfortunately, these girls first go and tell their mom abt these and they blow the hell out of the place for nothing. Finally the girls lifes is screwd for ever.<br>  Talk to her thro good frnds, preferably married female frnds of little oder age. If there had been heated arguments between parents, better keep both of them away for now. <br>  cheer up and be happy. wether it works out or not, this is not the end of life. If she doesnt deserve a good life, u cannt do anything abt it. Try ur best to make her understand.<br>  Msg me in YM if u wish<br>  sure will try to help as much as possible morally.<br>  my id is frndlyvel@yahoo.in|`|HAsDbQs5aa	My advise is short, be short, don't get into the old minded or old woman's mentality of following details, it is simple, talk to your wife/ex wife whatever, and try to fix it once and for all, either yes or no, divorce, get short and firm decisions, and write less, less silly details, more focus, more firm decisions, i somehow tend to think it is your detailed oriented irrelevant state of mind that you need to change first, i hope this helps, we all can change our state of mind, so do you, be firm with your woman, this is black, this is white, no Grey, best luck...|`|V9VJIw1Uaa	first clear your mind of the fact that it takes two to work on the marriage. if one partner is not ready to live with you how can you force her to? <br>  dont involve relatives here, they make things more complicated, it is conjugal life of you two, and only you two are to decide about future.<br>  go and try again to talk to her. send her warm massages on friendship networks, through mails, through text messages. dont blame each other. even if she does that try to avoid that. dont say anything negative for her mother and relatives. say her sorry honestly for your initial behavoiur in first two months.<br>  show her that you love her truly and you are working on your marriage. <br>  this will work.<br>  and if it does not work it is better to let her go without hassle. it will save you from much pain.|`|eeadfa83863691e265325eb89a9885b7aa	Wow - my first question would be HOW LONG did you two date, court, or whatever you want to call it-- before getting married?

D33VRTz8aa	I feel that both of you need to sit down and talk to each other. Let her know how you feel. <br>  <br>  I understand that she has the shop rent to worry about but you will have to look after your career too as failing to do that will effect the household income.<br>  <br>  If both of you communicate through things, you should not have any problems. Let her know that there are times during the day when I may need some time alone by my self for work purpose. If there would not be an important work I would not leave and go home. <br>  <br>  As you will always be there for her support. Tell her you will need the same understanding and support from her side so that you can success in your career as well as her. <br>  <br>  There will also be time when she will need support from you and the understanding too. You will ave to be there for her. Marriage is about both of you not just one of you. Both of you will have to compromise. <br>  <br>  If you let go half a string and she lets go of the other half. you will get a full string. Thats what marriage is all about.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|pOCabUMvaa	I think you and your wife have some problems to work out, that is just it, you have your business, and you say that us wives are there to interrupt you, because we always do.<br>  <br>  I do not know about you, but we are not all like that, you know that as much as I do..<br>  <br>  It seems that you should get this problem worked out with your wife, before it gets out of control.<br>  <br>  You can make your marriage work, along with having jobs, but you have to find out how.<br>  <br>  And men can be there to interrupt us working women also.<br>  <br>  It goes both ways.<br>  <br>  You are finding out that it does not come easy, and it does not, but you have to work at it also.<br>  <br>  Put effort into it, and  you will be surprised.

I think it might just depend on the stage you are at in life, meaning how old are u, stuff like that. But i think everybody should be able to support themselves rather than depending on a GIRLFRIEND or a BOYFRIEND.|`|KSKdr060aa	I don't think it is necessary to have a bf i tell my friends and parents everything and i just don't think we need someone attached to us like a twin. guys love me and tones have asked me out but i all ways say no and now im actually pretty good friends with them|`|ZbEMEc0Naa	families are nice,but a boyfriend/girlfriend gives different love. its nice to have someone to come home to and that takes care of you and such. its not nessesary to be happy,though. there are a lot of single,independant people out there.|`|pv6KE5xhaa	It's not necessary. In fact, if you're going into that sort of relationship just because you think it's "necessary", that's not based on the right reasons for a relationship.|`|FkWGGFTNaa	no it is not necessary.If you are a girl of my age i.e 15 years than better don't think of having one.Your parents must be your moral support and till you are at the age of at least 21 don't make a boyfriend.|`|4CebuvRhaa	There is no written code that you need to have a person as a bf or gf..you are absolutly free to be with only those who love you and whom you love...|`|rrdseKJIaa	ya bt the luv u get 4rm family or 4rnds is different.it is not so necessary bt sumtimes whn u r alone or feelin lonely u feel the need of love.so,depends man-to-man|`|1qwqhLlsaa	certainly not..!!<br>  its a personnel choice..|`|LSt3ybiQaa	No|`|jp5lfmzTaa	Better check up for normal growth of reproductive system.|`|41NyT8oPaa	Not necessarily, you need a boyfriend or girlfriend not to feel alone until the end of time, so that you can have someone by your side if you decided to have children.|`|XQWInrsBaa	Yeah we don't need a person especially called as boyfriend or girlfriend.  It's one's own choice not necessity. Well i don't have any boyfriend and i don't think so i should need one to get emotional support. My emotional support is within me so i am happy with my life.|`|9LTrcTA9aa	I personally believe that it is not necessary to have a gf/bf.

The categories of people are not meant to be filled with a person.

No law in the constitution that says everyone needs to have a boyfriend.|`|RPYS9HjRaa	really? really!?!<br>  <br>  If you don't know why it is necessary to have a partner then your parents need to have a word with you about the facts of life.|`|V9VJIw1Uaa	it is never necessary.. but if you fall for somebody then it will become life of yours. <br>  so never force it.. let love happen to you..|`|d1181e81ad7d73699f28849a1eb64de2aa	It is necessary to have Husband / Wife & I heard abt it......but I think it is not much necessary to have a Boy Friend / Girl Friend...!!|`|syf0oMrkaa	it is not necessary to have a boyfriend/girlfriend<br>  <br>  anyone can be your friend for support|`|qwXNl0n2aa	it is not necessary <br>        don't worry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KelmogX5aa	Hi<br>  No I don't think that a boyfriend or girlfriend is that necessary...if u have the support and love of ur frnds n family then u dont need that special person....|`|pJvyqZlWaa	In lieu with ur question, what drove u to ask this question anyway?

I just joined here and I feel that there is a lot of support out there and that I can ask almost anything and it won't make me feel or look stupid.  Everyone out there seems so real and honest and that's what I'm looking for.  Glad you feel the way you do!|`|0QYIbn1saa	I feel the SAME way.  NONE of my friends in Mpls (again NONE) have kids and very few are married (even though they are really old like me).  It's hard to relate to them sometimes.

I need to shut up!!!!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	My BEST friends don’t live near me anymore anyways. One lives in Mass, the other 5 hrs away in FL. We talk via email all the time, just don’t SEE each other as often. <br>  <br>  And ya know, that’s the same for some of you gals! So it doesn’t “feel” any different to me! It’s a huge sense of relief to have good support! Near and far!|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i dont think its pathetic at all. i know im more comfortable discussing alot of personal issues on here because not only do i feel were all here for the support but alot of us are going through the same things. we also all have time for y&a on lunch breaks or at our kids nap time. its always easy to reach out and "touch" someone on the computer.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	I sure hope not!<br>  <br>  I'm on here every day through the week. I tell some of you things that I'd never tell my real-life friends. Maybe it's the comfort of hiding behind a computer screen? I generally keep things to myself in real-life, it's nice to have people to confide in.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Nope not at all. It's easier this way.|`|j2mRop0laa	If so, I am too. *sigh*|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Sometimes it's easier to talk to someone who you don't socialise with on a day-to-day basis. The only person in my 'real life' who knows I was recently diagnosed with post natal depression is my husband. i don't want all our friends and family fussing over me, but on here it's much easier to discuss these things.<br>  Also, there are some subjects that bring me to tears when I talk about them - this way I can spare the embarrasment of crying in front of someone.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	If it is pathetic, count me into the pity party.<br>  <br>  I also feel much more closer to certain contacts of mine than real-life friends. Maybe it's because I talk to you all on a daily basis and not them.<br>  <br>  *sigh*<br>  <br>  BUT that's okay with me, some of you girls are the best I've ever *met* :)<br>  <br>  ETA: awe Nina I hope Aiden is feeling better!! Tyler just had his FIRST ear infection 2 weeks ago :( Poor little thing.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Not pathetic. I talk to the people on here more than I talk to my friends. Most of the people I was friends with before I had Landon were from work. Now that I don't work we have lost touch. I need to get out and make some new friends but I don't really know how to go about doing that. So, for now, I like the people on here better.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Nah. Sometimes I think it's easier to open up on here, and it's a lot easier to keep in touch by email or Messenger or whatever...you can talk at any time, anywhere. If you talk to a physical person <LOL>, you have to find time to meet for lunch, or a good time to call.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I feel the same way kinda.  It's not like I really talk to any of my contacts that often, but through the questions I feel like I share more with you guys.  Sometimes you guys make me smile when I need it and help keep me sane!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Then i must be as well.I find myself talking to people on here on a Daily basis and I tell them everything.My friends outside here I have not seen in mouths.<br>  <br>  ETA:Nina I am glad that he is feeling better.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	you are just fine the way you are.<br>  we are your friends.<br>  we are here when you need us.<br>  have a good week.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Hey....WE'RE *real* life too!!

But, he also had a bad temper.  She chose to marry a decent-looking, kind of chubby, lazy guy who rarely gets angry.  I'd work on getting rid of all that anger.
w1UKo2dnaa	PSH, LOL....sounds like he likes you.  It's like the old saying....a boy teases a girl (at any lengths) - and in the end, he just likes her. I had someone like that do the same back in high school. He did the same thing, getting his friends into the vibe, but ironically I had no made up nickname. But yeah, I can understand what you are going through. I wish I could give some helpful advice but sadly I have nothing. :D<br>  <br>  You see what happened is eventually the guy grew on me..after 3 years. BUT, by then.....he was over it. SO, you see.....the guy will after a while - leave you alone. If you show no signs of attraction to him....he will eventually give up and move on. I wish I could help more with the problem, but there's nothing really else to say. I guess, just ignore the guy - that's what I did....and after a couple years....he moved on.|`|ETHhnhLxaa	call him ugly face or whatever and he will shut up.

YldfngvAaa	I have had at least one a week for the past couple of months. (my wedding is in seven weeks.)<br>  <br>  I dreamed that we forgot to get dresses for the bridesmaids and tuxes for the groomsmen, so they all had to wear matching jeans and t shirts. <br>  <br>  Last week I dreamed that I never had my dress altered and it was huge and my family clamped it on me with huge metal clamps. <br>  <br>  And, the strangest of all, I dreamed that we never ordered a cake so my mom ran out to find one, and the only thing she could find was a giant penguin cake that had like a little water slide in the middle with plastic penguins sliding down it, kind of like where a fountain would be in a traditional cake. <br>  <br>  I have had a ton where it is half way through the reception and realize that I didn't remember the bachelorette party, shower, rehearsal or wedding. I guess I am kind of afraid that I will be too stressed and rushed through everything. Well, in any case, none of those things could really RUIN my big day. I am just excited to marry the man I love.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	For some reason I dreamed I married my high school sweetheart (not my fiance) and it was horrible. I knew it was so wrong and there was no way to stop it.<br>  plus our reception was in this dingy mold ridden hall and there were not enough chairs for me so I was standing the entire reception (while my husband and guests sat). Everything felt so wrong and I just wanted to cry.<br>  <br>  Thank god the real thing will not be like that!|`|sYUYkrzKaa	I was married before and I had a dream that he showed up and sat at my fiances place at our dinner table. It was ok tho because when he left he left completely. Abandoned me and took all the money. I haven't seen him since. So I got to tell him off in my dream. Even my daughter  told him That's not your place to sit , that's M's so move your butt and get lost again. Rather cathartic.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	The weirdest one I've had is that we had the wedding as normal, but for some reason the ceremony was held on the bed in my bedroom (all the guests somehow managed to squeeze into there), and that my bride was wearing a multi-colour rainbow dress.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Had a couple "nightmares" where I forgot my dress, forgot to take a shower and wash my hair, forgot to buy a ring, etc. These nightmares are very common for brides. Glad to see that yours are just silly dreams, and arent causing you any stress!|`|AA10784932	I just had one two nights ago! It was like my fiance and I didnt know it was our wedding day, and my mom called me to see where we were. Our wedding was at the town mall for some reason, and we show up in our car and there are a bunch of people there we dont even know. My ex boyfriend is on the corner taking pictures of us as we drive by. I ask my fiance why the heck is he there? We get inside the mall, and I ask my mom why there are so many people there. She said because She put the invitation in the newspaper, so anyone can come. I was freaking out becasue we didnt have enough food to feed everyone, and my hair wasn't done, i asked this one lady if she would do it for me, but we couldn't get into the bathroom because there was another lady in there pooping.. thats all i really remember. But the night before, my fiance and I were talking about the wedding and what all we needed planned still.|`|h836dd9qaa	Yeah.I've been having the same dream very other night. <br>  <br>  We're at the reception and his younger brother and my younger sister some how manage to sneak in nerf guns. Then they start chasing each other hit every with nerf darts. One of the dart hits me in the neck and fall in the top of my dress and my all to willing fiance (husband in my dream) offer to help retrieve the dart. At that point everyone burst into laughter including me.<br>  <br>  That's always about the time I wake up.
W0AK2Lumaa	Because society tell us that only REAL women give birth and be a mommy....<br>  Its BS I know...|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Not everyone wants children, although most people are very heavily conditioned to want them from a very early age.  Few people overcome the conditioning, so some people have children even though they might not really want them.<br>  <br>  In any case, nature has ensured that everyone takes an interest in sex, and sex leads to reproduction.  In this way, human beings are forced to reproduce, even in cases where they have no interest in reproducing (there is no maternal or paternal instinct in human beings, which perhaps explains why so many human children are badly mistreated).|`|5QrLcg6laa	i also see no point<br>  <br>  and its not like this world is the greatest place to bring in a new person|`|LepOqaN4aa	Why not.<br>  <br>  When you are able to create a life.<br>  Why would you pass on the oppertunity?|`|FR1SoLteaa	Well you were made,<br>  <br>  But the bigger question is why men have kids, by law it isn't theirs, its the moms, they are only needed for their money. Most thankless job ever. <br>  <br>  But if you find the right women, who values and respects her man, (Not submissive, but fully devoted towards the family, same for the guy) it can be the greatest experience of all time. <br>  <br>  But that is a matter of opinion|`|wvzQObahaa	cause it is very rewarding ! <br>  the most important reason is that  you lose your selfishness .<br>  the love you share with your husband/boyfriend expands immensely .<br>  your soul has other souls living in it ! <br>  you live your childhood again .you get to play again ! <br>  see life in a different perspective .<br>  pass your knowledge and experiences to a new set of hands ! <br>  you learn to love unconditionally .<br>  and when you reach old age ,you don't notice the wrinkles on your face because you'll be busy picking and tasting  more fruits ..your grandchildren!!! ..<br>  do you need more reasons why we have children ????|`|W7l1awFPaa	You lose your figure with age anyway, the pain is for a short time in return for a wonderful little human being.  Children can be an incredible blessing, not just a hassle.|`|7M7rrFPmaa	children are great!so cute!|`|AA10151168	where are you from? from Mars? people love children..they don't have chance to buy them..|`|233bbb5ff35324aa581bb39605c0d28daa	i often wonder that myself. i don't understand why anyone would want children.|`|ng2kORCyaa	fdsfsdfsdf|`|3vwvLWrHaa	Humans are stupid|`|A9sLvVDxaa	I'm not fond of children myself, but at least I figured it out early on, so I could take the needed precautions when having sex with women.  <br>  <br>  *puts on his heavy southern accent* An tha Lawd sed, bee frootfawl an multeepply!!!<br>  <br>  This is why there are so many people around! Too many people! We need population control!<br>  <br>  Most women have the ability to have children, but that doesn't mean they should. I think there should be a parenting college that inserts birth control devices into prepubescent boys and girls, and requires them by law to learn about parenting. <br>  <br>  Not every woman is automatically the Mom of the Year just because they had a baby. Smoking during pregnancy is so stupid, but I've seen it happen many times...just because one doctor said it was okay in the 50's.<br>  <br>  I'm rambling here... babies turn into children, it's a chance to improve society by raising a good kid. I get that. But most potential parents are just going to repeat the horrible parenting mistakes that their parents learned from their parents and all the way back to our days as monkey and amoeba.<br>  <br>  A baby is not an accessory, you can't leave them alone, and you can't trade in for a better one when you get bored with it.|`|N4L3Wkyxaa	Well...if anyone decides to have children,I think that the best way is to adopt ,that way you don't have to give birth,and you don't pass on your psycho physical mistakes to a whole new person....<br>  But I really think that having children is Completely Unnecessary..I don't understand why do some people really have a need for it|`|c2DWd8zHaa	Well, the most important part is to renew the human race. Other than that, a lot of people are excited to have a little son or daughter to look after and to show right from wrong.|`|M6HKcLScaa	its like having a pet, except u can tallk to them and they are the same. when u get older and u retire your children which will grow up will work for you and give you money to live|`|VwKoHJGqaa	Nobody wants to have children<br>  <br>  its an accident every time|`|vld1F5Auaa	Maybe because some people actually want to love others. Its not all about how you look you know.|`|5332cbc2fb8beac047978657c5a6a26eaa	that is a question you need to answer yourself|`|vdmqdlNfaa	Why have balls?|`|H7Lvi5jZaa	when u will be old enough u will find an answer to your question|`|67QVKHQ3aa	what a dumb question..thats totally your opinion some people spend years trying to concieve and its ppl like you end up gettin knocked up and get abortions b/c your social life is your first priority...having a child is something for GROWN WOMEN to do, not lil girls like yourself one day your will see what its all about, and possibly regret not having one of your own when your old and decreped and have no one to look after you, or give a S*** at all..|`|AA11596133	GOOD QUESTION!!<br>  <br>  SORRY, but if I could do it all over again, I would not have had any.
FzFSzilmaa	get him on facebook or myspace... and chat with him...
5HxFTVq1aa	That is a rather confusing question, did you just meet him? or have you been together for ages now. because if you just met him, then one month is not enough time in no sense. if you have been going out for ages, and got engaged and all that, then it seems like he wants the month to save some money for the wedding and stuff.|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	You have known him a month and he wants to marry you?  RUN as far away as possible.  It will not work, it will not last.  Finance is hardly a good reason to marry.  I think true love comes into it somewhere.  You would not see my a..e for dust if someone proposed that to me.|`|sB9xp8wraa	There could be all kinds of reasons. Marriage is a big step for a guy, and extremely frightening. <br>  <br>  That being said, one of the biggest things in a marriage is trusting your partner, and you might as well start now, so if he says the reason is financial, then that's what it is, unless you have solid proof that it isn't.|`|U3tZzGlgaa	Before I proposed to my wife, I wanted to make sure that I had enough money to pay for the engagement ring.  Before we set a wedding date, I wanted to make sure that I had enough money for the wedding and the honeymoon.  So yes, financial concerns do come into play when making wedding plans.  Unless you have more information, there doesn't seem to be any reason to doubt him.|`|pKNAeYCQaa	You didn't really give enough details for me to suspect anything. I mean, it very well could be financial issues, especially with today's economy. Perhaps he's waiting for a bonus or a raise before you two start planning a wedding, since they can be so expensive. Rule of thumb: if you can't trust the guy about this, you shouldn't be considering marriage with him.|`|WRC0O6tqaa	this is good idea .. may be he has a problem waiting single or someother problems .. u sould accept him ..if urnot ready in one month then tell him please wait some time more if he couldnt wait then u should know he has a problem to marry soon and u shuld be agree with him and make planing to marry goodluck|`|PLeFgKEHaa	it can honestly be for any reason. if he says its for financial reasons no need to think anything else... unless you have good reason to.
abx5VNsOaa	What a pig,grrrrrrr,so insensitive and down right mean.<br>  The best thing you can do is forget his pathetic a** and have a fabulous life,he will get his karma,hopefully it is instant and long lasting.|`|AYfJWQuTaa	What a coward he hasn't the balls to finish with you in a decent manner, you are so well better off without a man like that!<br>  Text him & tell him he is a wimp & that you are very happy without him, if he ever responds make him jealous by mentioning a super new guy (real or not!). Lucky escape, never go back!|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Firstly why do u call yourself smartass,just wondering? All the signs were in front of you that he is no more interested but you ignored. You got the final answer you deserved from him so it is over. You should be wise to look the story at a whole,just don't look at the sweet talk. The man is acting 9 years old still playing in the play ground of school,so here is the question,do u think such low-life person will add anything to your life? you know the answer. I do not think he will call you and you need to count your blessing because you should consider yourself luck he is gone. Please don't lower yourself for him. Let him do his chasing and 10 years you will see him in the street chasing young kids.<br>  <br>  Learn from that and next time stop dating crap man obviously that is what he qualifies as crap ****.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Your asking what I think of him <br>  I think at his age he is a child in a mans body acting like a school boy playing games. One would hope by that age dropping hints about your true feelings is more than dropping hints while dating.<br>  Let him move states and play his games with others knowing you can do better in life.<br>  Who cares if he calls you back in the end hes a boy not a man for his age.|`|8VlDuMFOaa	Honestly, would you want him to call you?<br>  If I were in your shoes, the only reason I would want him to call was so I could tell him how much of a pig he was .....<br>  <br>  Maybe he will come back some day when the new girlfriend realizes how much of a jerk he is...I just hope for your sake that you have moved on by then, and be over him.<br>  <br>  You deserve better than that.....let him go.... and find someone that will treat you the way that you should be treated.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Oh,yeah one day he will call you. It maybe about a restraining order, but he'll call.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	The day might come that he would call you, but you would be a fool to answer the phone.  Is this what you want in a man?

I think that he should have been a man about it and talk to you about the relationship. I find it sad that you had to find out that he dumped you from someone else and that he put you in that situation in the first place. I think that you deserve better than that and maybe when he wakes up one day maybe it will be to late maybe you will have someone else in your life and if he calls you. You should really think twice about if he is worth it and if he deserves to be in your life. if you take him, back he will probably put you threw more hurt. no one deserve to go threw that its not worth all that hurt <br>  I hope I help good luck god bless|`|HQ8xCEdZaa	HE IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.Guys who do that are afraid or really selfish for they don't know how to tell the person face-to-face what he really feels.Just Imagine if you give him another chance...for sure he will do it and also you will be hurt.He is not even worth to be called a "decent guy". For me, he is the worst of the worst(In Japan he will be called "saite"-lowest kind).Remember that you are way better off without him and you are lucky to be rid of that kind of guy.|`|N2AKuvVkaa	The day probably will come when he will call you, when he has had another 20 girlfriends, is 45, and remembers the one girl that tried to hang on to him.

You both have to feel the same way, and to be honest if it has taken you 3 weeks to think about it then you have some doubts which is never good.

U3tZzGlgaa	If you have his e-mail, simply write, "Hi! It's me (Your name here)!  How are you doing?"<br>  <br>  It's best to start e-mailing him as a friend for now.  If things don't work out with his girlfriend, hopefully he'll let you know.  If he's at all interested in you, he'll start asking more about you and whether or not you're dating anyone.  That will be your chance to let him know how you feel about him.  Until then, just keep it friendly.|`|HNpHCjCsaa	something don`t sound right  you need to rewrite|`|8OzWqV8Haa	You just have to start talking at some point or you won't have a chance.

Also, she's probably short on cash to go out for dinner.  Now if you had TOLD her it was on you, then she'd probably go to dinner with you.  You're at a point in the relationship where she can't ASSUME that you'll pay for her dinner just yet, so she is thinking about her own finances.  She wanted to make sure that you understood her situation and didn't want you to be hurt by asking you, "so is it cool?"  If you did have a meal-card plan, she would assume that you would just go with her anyways.  Don't consider her actions in this scenario as a cold one.  Remember that in the future, when you ask her to go somewhere with you that requires money, tell her that it's on you.  Otherwise, expect her personal finances to take a role in her decision-making.|`|92XQvyOCaa	you are actually not boyfriend and gf, are you? maybe she felt a bit awkward of her behavior that day..like when she thinks about it..or did you not pay enough attention when she said she's ill?

2S2onP86aa	Been there done that. The guy I liked before, did the same, except he just didn't even tell me why, he didn't even say that he wants to break up. He just did it, deleted me from his MSN and avoided me the whole time. That was pretty sick. Which it made me feel worthless. But that's how some guys are. So lame and stupid. They can't face you or give you reasons to why they broke up with you and you end up hurting and losing a bit of your confidence, because you might think there is something wrong with you - but no darling, there is something WRONG with THEM and not us nice girls. So whatever. Don't contact him, he'll regret it, what goes around comes around anyway. So let go of it. I found a much better guy now that appreciate me for me. So good luck to you, you'll find a better guy. <3|`|nfdlPfdQaa	Move on, because it will most likely happen again. Don't give him the satisfaction of extending the argument so don't contact him again.

Now lets get to business, you dated this guy for 3 months, right? So after three months, you get dropped out of the blue with no explanation... You do deserve some sort of explanation or closure. I would simply call him and ask what his reasoning was. Did you say something to offend him, had there been a misunderstanding of some sort? If he gives you a legitimate answer and is a man at all, talk to him about it. If he refuses to tell you anything and is a jerk, then he was never worth your time. Before you call make sure you have your bearing, try to have a friend near by who can give you some moral support so that you don't fall apart on the phone with this guy.

People move. You change! Your needs. Like your action, attitude, etc. Some people mature faster then others. I meet a girl in church when I was 3 when was the bestest of friends all through school. She got married and had children and her priories changed. Now its her husband and children. We still talk but we aren't as close. We go 2-3 months with out talking.

You may move apart but as long as you keep contact then anything is possible.  If you do loose contact with them and you are meant to continue a friendship, then the powers above will make it happen.  I went to school with some friends and obviously we all grew up and I lost contact with them and then suddenly via another email of a mutial friend, I found them again.  We all now have children and heaps of stuff to catch up on over a cuppa.  Another school friend of mine has moved to another state but I still have her number keyed into my phone and with caller ID I always know when she has called and quickly call her back for a lovely chat and catch up.  Friendships come and go but if you find true friendship, those rules don't apply, they will remain your friends forever.|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	It depends on what you mean by friends.  At this point, even those whom I thought i hated back in highschool, that hate or problem means very little to me now.  Of course, that crush i had, and the group I hung out with, that doesnt mean a whole lot either.  so yeah, im still friends with all my old friends, and when I run into them at the mall we say hello whats up, maybe send a card on xmas, but its not like we get together every day to smoke in back of the school and talk about girls anymore.|`|Xz0KHqFWaa	that's really difficult to maintain but it depends upon you. but always remember, nothing is impossible.|`|NRiuGQvIaa	if you worked hard to be friends forever maybe likely one outta all your friends will stay forever if he/she a true friend & the rest some will die<br>  others married with their own life & paths life goes on|`|mGQOgjeYaa	rare but yeah. you must be young, just don't too much trust in anyone.
htWw0OlCaa	LOL!!  At this point in time in my marriage, I would love to be able to hear my husbands thoughts, because we don't talk, AT ALL.... We mainly get into arguments over this, that's when words fly out of his mouth that I NEVER hear him say, especially towards me. So, yes, I would love to have the ability to hear his thoughts.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	No I wouldn't want to hear all of my spouse's thoughts and yes it would bother me.  Come on, how many irrational thoughts, mean spirited comments do people repress..quite a bit if we are honest with ourselves.

oOVAbKPmaa	I've been married for more than 28 years, and though I wouldn't describe it as a bad marriage, I would have to say that it is and always has been a " blah " marriage at best. Was it worth it? In some ways, yes. In most ways, no. And I guess what bothers me the most is the fact that I'm sure I could've been much happier with someone else. I just don't know who that someone might've been because I never met her. Well, I take that back. I did meet her, but it wasn't until two years ago, and because of circumstances, it just couldn't have ever happened. Besides, at my age, I have little doubt that I'd have the energy or the resources to make a change if the opportunity even presented itself. So, I guess I'll just go on the way I am, unhappy, but resigned to it and accepting of it...|`|htWw0OlCaa	Well, my marriage is bad, but its tolerable... The only reason we are together is because we have a 4 year old who is autistic and her doctor said to us from day one that any changes in her home life could set her back in her therapy, and Im very scared of that. So, we just found ways of dealing with one another and tolerate things. We don't fuss or fight in front of her if that were to come up, we have been doing pretty good about keeping things to our selves. Is it worth it? Yes, my daughter is very much worth it. I will do anything for her even if it means me being miserable, its worth it.|`|ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	Depends what their reasoning is for staying in the bad marriage.. usually if someone stays its either for the kids, or money, or security.. and well if they got what they wanted out of it.. then my guess it was worth it.. even though my personal oppinion is all that happens when someone stays.. is your just wasting each others time, and end up looking back regreting the years u lost on someone that didnt deserve it.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	It's never worth it. Life is to be enjoyed not tolerated.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	I stayed for about 7 years after I realized it was really and truly unsalvageable.  I did it because I was young, stupid, scared, and insecure with my ability to make it on my own.<br>  <br>  In hindsight - no it really wasn't worth it.  I lost 7 years of my life that I can't back.  The flip side is that those 7 years are also a huge part of the person I am now, and two years after I left that marriage I met my current husband who is everything I could have dreamed of and more.  <br>  <br>  So, I guess there was a reason why I stayed, but I truly don't think anyone should throw away years of their life on something that doesn't make them happy.|`|a0024a8805bd3c2a385199e722566faeaa	I was in a very short and very bad marriage.  I left after 7 months...we went through a divorce for over a year...and before it was finalized she decided to try to make things work.  <br>  <br>  I can say that I'm glad that I have yet to finish the divorce.  However, before you say you have a bad marriage you have to figure out why it's bad.  It sucks to have to start over.  You find out that what's out there isn't better than what you have at home.|`|AA11596133	NO NO NON NOOOONNNNNNOOOOONNNNNNOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  THE biggest waste of time and energy EVER.|`|AA11656632	No!
DzUxBehhaa	Usually, aproaching someone is the most difficult part, but you seem to be ok with that.  Next is to keep their attention.  Make jokes, tell them something interesting like something you saw on the news.  DON'T talk about cars and science and technology, most girls will be bored to tears! Talking about fashion is good.  Ask them question like what do you think of the new Guess add. or something like that. In other words, get them talking as well, else they will get bored to just listen all the time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and anfter a good conversation, remember to take a phone number if you like the person and LET THEM WAIT!! Call them after 24 hours,  but don't let them wait to long. Invite them for coffee and take it from there (movies after coffee might be good). Don't invite them to your house too soon.<br>  <br>  Another tip: always leave them wanting more!!|`|e232166370ff94d78e94215e4b9afd12aa	Well, Marylin Monroe was quoted saying "if you can make a girl laugh, you can make her do anything."<br>  Personally, I like a man to smile and be friendly, but not grin like a cheshire cat... you dont want someone to think youre intellectually challenged.......hahahha........but seriously, communication between the sexes can be the most awkward thing to overcome. I find if I ask the person questions about themselves, not too personal mind, just general things like what they enjoy doing, have they travelled, do they want to travel...etc... this always gets the ball rolling. Most of us like talking about ourselves, esp us females, and when someone gives us permission, we often take the ball and run with it.<br>  Mind body language, your own and hers. If she is not interested in talking to you at that moment, it doesnt mean it is personal. But if you get 'vibes' that she is uncomfortable then change the subject or excuse yourself with some other distraction. If you really like that particular girl, atleast you know each others names now and next time you can open simply with 'Hi, how have you been?', or bring up a topic that you both talked about easily during the last chat you had with her. Try to be confident but not 'cocky'...................most importantly 'be yourself', remember you are unique and extra special, there is no-one on this planet quite like you. Anyway, you sound like a really sweet guy, someone equally special is out there looking for you!|`|EWaPcT2kaa	just want to know, do you think your friends look better than you? maybe you need to meet girls without them. you know what i mean? try going out alone.  and once you are talking to a girl, don't talk much about science..ask her things about herself, and listen to what she's saying.  talk about fashion but not so much coz she might think you're gay or something.  if you're talking to her for an hour, and she's not bored, that's a good sign.  be a gentleman, respect her and please don't talk about sex or getting laid during your first conversation.  make sure to ask for her number. for the next date, coffee, movies, or dinner would be fine.<br>  <br>  good luck with the ladies. i hope i was of help.
YldfngvAaa	My shower is in two weeks, and nobody wanted to play the same old games, so we just came up with a few things. We are going to give everyone blank bingo cards and have them fill them out with items they think I will open. Then give prizes throughout the gift opening. We are also doing a little game where you put the bride and grooms name on a paper. Then everyone has two minutes to come up with as many words out of the letters as they can. LIke<br>  <br>  Jennifer Jones           Sam Smith<br>  <br>  <br>  Stones, fin, mast, fern, ETC...|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	ug, please skip the games.  it's bad enough watching someone open gifts for 3 hours.|`|sFNNDqhGaa	Here are some ideas for both the bridal shower and bachelorette party as you might be involved in that as well.<br>  <br>  Bridal Shower, keep it appropriate to your guests. So if Grandma and Aunt Bea and nieces under 18 are coming avoid the focus on sex, men's private parts, etc... (Do that during the bachelorette party)<br>  <br>  When planning the bridal shower, think about what is special about her, what she likes and how this relationship has made her happy. Try to see if a theme comes out of that. <br>  <br>  Then work to match up decorations, favors and games where you can share that information with others and put the bride to be in a happy place, so she enjoys herself. <br>  <br>  Here is a list of bridal shower games to get you started<br>  <a href="http://partygameideas.com/bridal-shower/games-list.php" rel="nofollow">http://partygameideas.com/bridal-shower/...</a><br>  <br>  Also, the more strangers at the shower the more you should start with an ice-breaker game. And if you have a diverse age range consider paper and pen games so all ages can play. Games that involve running or pushing could send Grandma to the hospital and well, nobody wants that. <br>  <br>  For your bachelorette party be a little risque, see these games as they should give you a few ideas. <a href="http://partygameideas.com/bachelorette-party/" rel="nofollow">http://partygameideas.com/bachelorette-p...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck<br>  Sarah|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	The key to bridal shower games is:<br>  1. Keep them short and sweet. <br>  2. Teams/pairs work best, to keep people talking and interactive.<br>  3. Dont do too many games. 3 should be sufficient.<br>  <br>  For example, Bridal BINGO is the absolute worst game ever! Who wants to mark on sheet every time the bride opens a gift? Zzzzz.. Look for games that are short and let people talk. Put some songs about love on an iPod speaker and put the ladies in pairs. Whoever can name the most songs by their correct title (or artist) is the winner. Another one, is a little ridiculous, but its all in good fun. Put the ladies in two teams and give each team some toilet paper or paper towels and tape. Each team designs a dress, which one team member models. Basically you wrap the paper around the model to get your desired design. Whichever dress the bride likes better is the winner.<br>  <br>  Sorry I dont have more suggestions for you. Hope this helps you find some good ones though.|`|AA10886262	honestly, no one enjoys playing games at bridal showers or baby showers.....|`|RuKK1LYiaa	go to Bridesmaid101.com its super helpful and has lots of great ideas|`|b1c1cfae4e69dbb558dcec1bac53da19aa	I have hosted some bridal showers, my sister and a close friend's shower, as well as attend. Here are some games I have played or seen done.<br>  <br>  1) Give each guest a balloon and see who can blow up the biggest or even who pops it first, yes it can be loud, but some what fun too. It is basically who can blow the fastest.<br>  <br>  2) Bridal pictionary, separate into groups, draw things that are related to weddings and/or the bride<br>  <br>  3) Box of recipes, when sending out the invites, put a recipe with the card and have each guest write down a recipe whether it be an old family or just a random one and then put it in a book for the bride.<br>  <br>  4) This is more of a bride game, you pick four random objects (can be kitchen or household or anything else) and have her blind folded so she cant see what she is touching. Then have her describe what she has, she can touch, smell or even taste if she feels like it. You will get a kick out of what she might think it is to what it actually is.<br>  <br>  5) This can be a door prize, you have each guest write down their wedding date or if single, their birthday date and whoever has the closes date to the wedding date wins.<br>  <br>  6)You always got the old standby bridal bingo<br>  <br>  7) Making a wedding bouquet out of toilet paper, divide each guest into teams to come up with one, best design wins<br>  <br>  8) Another old stand by bridal crossword puzzles<br>  <br>  9) For an ice breaker, give each guest a close pin and then at the start give everyone three words, related to the bridal shower or how ever you want it, and throughout the shower whoever says one of those words loses their clothes pin, the one with the most at the end wins, it is almost like the "baby" game at a baby shower where you cant say baby.<br>  <br>  10) This game is where the bride leaves the room and everyone has to write down 10-15 things about her. What she is wearing, hair-eye color, jewelery, shoes, socks (pending on what she wearing) whoever guesses the most wins.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. I know some of them are lame but its a wedding shower, they can be fun.|`|crxbob5jaa	I agree with ABC that people don't like games at bridal showers. However, I did find one that seems to work well. The guests all get a blank bingo card and write one thing in each space that they think the bride will receive as a gift at the shower. As the bride is opening gifts they mark off each item if it is on their card. As they get a row, they get a  small prize like a candy bar or something. The first person to "BINGO" can get an actual larger prize if you want. It's not cheesy and is actually fun. It also makes a good ice-breaker when people are trying to find something to talk to strangers about during refreshments.|`|2Av3gIqgaa	This was my favorite game I have ever played at a Bridal Shower:  Prior to the shower, the bridesmaids had made up a bunch of questions about the groom or about their relationship and written down all of the answers.  Then, at the shower, they asked the bride all of the questions.  If she gave the same answer that he did, nothing happened.  If she got them wrong, she had to chew a piece of gum. <br>  <br>  Sounds stupid except that the groom had answered all of the questions wrong on purpose, so by the end of the game, my cousin (the bride) has about 20 pieces of Bubbilicious in her mouth and couldn't even talk!  <br>  <br>  No one could stop laughing and we learned a lot about the two of them in the process.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	skip them altogether.

Changing your appearance is not going to help you in the bedroom. Change the place and time that you to go at it. I think you two should get a motel room for a nooner or role play, read a book about sexual positions and move that you two can try and see what you both like. Take a bath with each other. The only thing making your sex life boring is you two. Try new things that you and him have aways wanted to try. Good luck and use a condom.|`|Izs1XliOaa	Lasenza.co.uk<br>  Lovehoney.co.uk
w1UKo2dnaa	I have the same problem. The only advice I can give....is to open up more I guess. Try starting out conversations yourself rather than waiting for the other party to talk. Try it out with people you just meet from others, or from family. <br>  <br>  This sort of worked out for me, but....I always revert back to old habits. It's a work in progress though, give it time. You can't expect to see immediate results since you are so used to clamming up when you meet a guy you are attracted to. Be patient, and just be persistent on working on the shyness. Good luck :)|`|MnVcx0HDaa	Just be yourself ... do anything and everything to calm yourself.  The absolute hardest thing is to maintain self confidence when you perceive someone as being "superior" to you.  Dont look at them as someone you want, rather someone you just want to know.<br>  <br>  Look him in the eye, you'll see he's just another person, and you'll relax.  Concentrate on the conversation but use other things to split your attention, watch other people, look at the TV, let your eyes wander away from his eyes to something less intimidating.<br>  <br>  Oh and smile, think positively and you'll respond in a more confident upbeat manner.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|dBUREC7Kaa	just be confident and surround your self with your friends and him. then when you finally get comfortable break away from them and talk to him. Always smile.|`|Ze3dumvgaa	Maybe when you're out and you see someone, just look over at them and if they meet eyes with you just smile and look away...That should be enough...Or you could just talk to them at the bar or whatever...|`|ejuJiZAAaa	how old are you?|`|k2I7zeV2aa	i have the same problem, but my strategy is to just stay a distance. if your personality is true, word will travel fast to his ears and he'll be looking for you. Snob him until you gain comfort around him and regain your confidence; that way you're playing hard-to-get AND saving yourself from humiliation. Two birds with one stone ;)<br>  PS nice dog :]|`|Kdky4CDKaa	Well first you have to find out what you and the guys that you attract to in common, then just go up to them and talk to them. I am sure if you are sexy and beautiful like some people say, then I am sure those guys will want to talk to you.|`|VBapAIaIaa	try imagining yourself being very confident and open to guys you're attracted to. works for me. say, imagine you accidently bumped into him, so imagine yourself saying what you want to, and what you would really being 'perfectly fine'.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, just go be normal of yourself, do not change! I know that feeling shyness just start out of convos, do not be nervous !!! :]]|`|lg8jmL5Daa	well I think it is sweet.<br>  <br>  don't be embarrassed by this.<br>  It will grow over when you get older.<br>  <br>  just be yourself.<br>  <br>  good luck,<br>  <br>  Oliph|`|ee2cb0e50b042b9d2cc97b069ac81153aa	don't overcome it..|`|V1x2UJpMaa	Oh my gosh! I am so like that. I'm good with most guys, but when I have feelings for them or am extremely attracted to them I just close up like a clam, and they think I'm not keen! It's so annoying!<br>  <br>  Thankfully, I usually overcome this after about the third time seeing them. To be more confident and less shy, I taker the following steps:<br>  <br>  I take deep breaths, tell myself in my mind how good looking I am through the man's eyes (even if it's not true, it gives me confidence), and I step with my hips (it gets the endorphins going, so I am happy, not nervous and I look confident with my appearance), when a man is staring at my eyes I stare at his eyebrows or forehead so I'm less intimidated and I think of happy things that make me smile and look keen.<br>  <br>  That's it, good luck and I hope that I helped x
sVVGAZNAaa	I would mind my own biz.|`|gIEToEPBaa	Have you talked about your concerns with her, although she my not be willing to listen, try it. And if it doesnt work, then consider tellling her mother
afkygHMgaa	Why are you and your husband as a grown adult family living with his mother and why is everyone else there too? Get a life. You and your husband need to be adults and go rent or buy a flat of your own|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	the most constructive thing I can say about your question is that you are OK because your husband is on your side.  And that's the way it should be.  If you all live together then you have to work it out so stop nit picking and try contributing further.  Put your sister in law to shame and shine in your mother in laws eyes.|`|AA10059368	No I do not think you are wrong she should have got up off her butt to help you.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I think you need to find your own place to live. Then there would be less resentment and arguing..|`|OXxKTM6vaa	No, they are being bitches.|`|D33VRTz8aa	Hi <br>  <br>  You are not wrong in your feelings. This will continue until your sister in law will be in the same house. <br>  <br>  Either you and your husband move out of the house and find your own place. I suppose your sister in law is not married. <br>  <br>  If this is your own house which they are living in with you then I guess find a way out. To separate the two of them so they don't spend much time together. as If they have nothing to do then these types of incidences will increase.<br>  <br>  Does you sister in law not work?<br>  <br>  One thing is good that your husband is on your side. Be careful that he does not switch sides.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Hmmm...... you're all sharing one house?  Who amongst you all *didn't* see this kind of thing coming?<br>  <br>  I know you haven't told us the whole story here (it's OK, there's a character limit on Y!A), but it's obvious from halfway around the world that your house is just bursting-full of simmering resentments.  It all sounds like the damage is already done (and some time ago!), and not much can really be done about it now -- short of serious and expensive family counseling!<br>  <br>  Out of all the people in the house, the one I feel most sympathy for is your husband.  He's caught between the woman he loves, and the woman he loves.  *You* are the future he chose for himself, and the woman he most wants to live with.  But on *your* side, don't ever ask a guy to trash his mother, or choose between you & her -- remember that she was and will always be his *first* love -- and that you *want* a guy who loves his mother!  I give him top marks for maintaining any equilibrium whatsoever between you & his mum, if he's managed to so far.<br>  <br>  Move out with your husband as soon as you can.  However much of a financial strain this may be, it beats X many more years of living in domestic hell.  There are so many healthier ways of keeping a roof over your heads!<br>  <br>  Unless, of course, you and/or your husband are the owners of the property, in which case you (two) need to firmly establish some rules of the house.  And then be gently implacable about enforcing them.<br>  <br>  Without knowing the whole story, there is no way for us out here to advise you on the right or wrong of your feelings.  We are strangers to you, and we can't possibly take sides:  family dynamics are just never "clean" enough.  It sounds to me like you're doing your best, but there are two sides to every story -- sometimes many more than two.  But at the very least, a decisive separation is called for.  Think about it.<br>  <br>  And good luck.|`|ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	Ummmm if im understanding the story right, the sister in law is the trouble maker, not the mother in law, just because she agreed, doesnt mean she "really agreed" sometimes for the sake of not arguing someone will just say "yep" and let things go in one ear and out the other.. its the sister in law trying to cause the drama not the mother in law.. <br>  <br>  "my sister-in-law said" to my mother-in-law that i didnt see her as important because I asked my own mum for advice on something. My mother-in-law "agreed" even though she doesn't know the full story.<br>  <br>  I think your disrespect is towards the wrong person.. the drama queen seems to be the sister in law|`|AA11596133	You lost respect for her because of......what?  Because she has too much time on her hands and she listens to her daughter?  Or because you broke your routine and she got miffed?  Because she did not tell anyone to go help you do dishes? <br>  <br>  She is a GUEST at the SIL house, right?  You all are pitching in on helping her heal, right?  OK - first, no doubt she does not enjoy living there, so that makes her irritated.  She has to count on others, that makes her grumpy too.  When she is not happy, nobody is going to be happy. <br>  <br>  YES, you are wrong for loosing respect for the woman - this is not her normal self, and not where she wants to be.  Cut the old lady some slack and try not to be so sensitive.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Why is the whole family living in the same house?|`|AA11656632	No you're not wrong. But you & your husband need a place of your own. Move out.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	You are my idle, my new hero.  You've maintained respect and dignity and are a woman of value and character married to a man who supports you.  You are a Hallmark commercial....except for those relatives who need to find a hobbie other than making your life more difficult.  <br>  <br>  If there's a nice way to do it, I'd say distance yourself from them.  They are in a place that's not healthy for you and clearly are not thinking of you or your husbands best interests or feelings.  I could be wrong.<br>  Not like don't see them, but you are really invested in them and their opinions and fulfulling their every need.  The street is a two way and you were willing to go all out, but they kind of messed up the fun (you would do the dishes without a thought, but it irked you because of the lack of respect) of giving.<br>  <br>  If I may, I'll tell you a story about myself, another big giver, I LOVE to give, get off on it, bringing smiles to loved ones makes be very happy.<br>  Anyway, the first year of my marriage my husband got breakfast in bed, I mean the WORKs, eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, perfect toast, sometimes, pancakes or french toast, and the newspaper, on a tray delivered with love and a happy kiss and he would love it.  Nice huh?  Then one Sunday morning (I was a very stressed out rising professional), I curled my toes, yawned, stretched and saw my loving husband next to me and said, "sweetheart, can you make breakfast this morning", and this forever sticks with me...his answer "no".  My happily lazy eyes became wide open, "but _name here___ I always do it, can't you do it this once?".   His reply forever burned into making my giving not a happy place "if you don't want to do it, don't do it, I never asked you to do it."     Thank you for letting me share.  My point after this, in hindsite, irrelevent, but sort of in the same zip code in relevence, is that don't give if it makes you unhappy.  There are people you will encounter that will be just like you, but there are more that are not and if you resent being taken advantage of, stop.  Don't be mean or harbor ill will, just put yourself first, don't change your plans to "do" for them anymore - they kind of lost the priviledge of being put first.<br>  <br>  What do you think?<br>  <br>  And to answer your question.  You, again, are my hero...felonies could have happened and you maintained a dignity that St. Peter and the Karmic Gods will surely reward.  Now you go and put your family first.  Your husband is a keeper, to be sure.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	No I don't think you're wrong at all.  It's beyond me why on earth she thinks/expects you would come to her first over your own mother??  It sounds like it doesn't matter what you do, it'll never be right or good enough for her. I'm glad your husband is sticking up for you. <br>  <br>  What are the chances of you and him getting a place of your own?  These nit picking, stress inducing things are going to continue to crop up as long as you are both living there....|`|d8014a4c8a0d00a6352feb566ba41503aa	First off, sounds like everyone has too much idle time on their hands.<br>  Your mother in-law needs to find a job to keep her occupied.<br>  <br>  second, I would refuse to clean up after adults, if they are old enough to wipe their own butts, then they are old enough to clean up after themselves!<br>  <br>  just mind your own business and do your thing and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  ps; don't get caught up in the gossip, and move the hell out of there!

I respect you for not drinking and looking after yourself and people will respect you for that too, even if your immediate circle of friends are too immature to realise that. If you start changing yourself just to please others then you will lose your way completely. I'm a martial artist and also an instructor and I have went through periods of being single in my life just as all of us have. It's not really as hard as you might imagine to get dates and a girlfriend, you just have to stay true to yourself and don't try too hard, I don't mean don't make an effort when the time comes, but don't try too hard, certainly try not to stress over it.<br>  <br>  I hardly drink because it would be harmful to what I want out of life, and I train hard because it gives me the life I want, and is giving me the most amazing career and life. Check my profile if you like. After quite a few realtionships in my life I now have whom I consider to be the most beautiful and amazing girlfriend in the world.<br>  <br>  Your hobbies will not put anyone off, not anyone who is worth having anyway.

Being nice is not getting you any ?  Stay the course... and you will find the right one rather than drunks at the bars|`|64cf4def66c3758d77a8429798de064caa	You  probably heard it loads of times there is someone out there for you. Just be patient , I know its hard,  and you start to put yourself down, but realy its not that you cant find anyone, its just that it is not the time, its whats on the inside that matters, you are probably a nice charactered person, try going to different places to see if it makes a difference to your life, and not to try to hard, it will come, mark my words. Please do not give up your hobbies as this is not the way forward to make yourself unhappy, in order to try and please, what happens if you are still alone, then you would also be unhappy too. Why do your friends think all girls prefer a not nice drunken person.<br>  All I can say my friend is be your NATRAL self, dont change the way you are, try making a conversation and not being shy to the way you are. good luck.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Don't listen to those idiots.Start watching their lives.Sooner or later this is what you are going to hear from them son:<br>  "My g/f cheatd on me and said she wouldn't if she had not been drunk...I don't know what to do"<br>  "My g/f or b/f dumped me because I made out with some other guy or girl but I was drunk I don't think they should hold it against me"<br>  '"Hey.....I'm in jail can you bail me out?"<br>  "I have to go to court for a dui".<br>  My b/f or g/f broke up with me because they say I have a drinking problem".<br>  "I wrecked the family car lol,I was stinking sh-t faced drunkl and run it up a tree hahahahahaha"<br>  I am not saying this to be mean,this IS what your going to eventually hear from them.<br>  Next do you want a girl who gets drunk?Ever live with a drunk?It is not fun,their alcohol will always come before you.<br>  Next,kick boxing will keep you in shape.However I will never forget one time my buddy and I went to visit his g/f they had cable tv and kick boxing was on.<br>  I forget the 2 guys names, they were both in excellent shape had the head gear foot pads and gloves on.The one kicked the other in the head after a few moments into the match.The other guy instantly died.ALL that training just to die.<br>  Listen to all the retured boxers son, they are all "punch drunk".<br>  It is good to know self defense and to keep yourself in shape, but to fight for sport for glory and money is foolish in the end.<br>  The weight liftingis good, but  when you max out, always work out with about 20 lbs less for a week or so before increasing.This way your body has more time to adjust and be very careful.I have seen some nasty things happen to weight lifters.Next be more outgoing towards the girls, find some who like some of the same things you like, for instance maybe movies and bowling instead of drinking and drugs.|`|6ccbb7bfa194c05cb1b9693749efd058aa	You should definitely not give up on your hobbies for a girlfriend. You are only 17, a girlfriend isn't the most important thing right now. Even though I know it might seem like it.  You shouldn't have to change the way you act or the things that are important to you in order to get a girlfriend.  You want a girl who is going to respect you for what you do and support you in your hobbies.  Just wait for her, I'm sure she's out there.<br>  <br>  p.s.

(read the book "Anastasia" - that will change your life as well.)|`|Xv6R1tLqaa	relax your only 17, be happy being yourself, when you are comfortable with who you are others will be comfortable around you too. it is all about being confident. you shouldn't listen to people who tell you to "stop being nice and get drunk" they are fidiots and are gonna drag you down with them. saying that tho' you are still only 17 and are gonna have a lot worse s**t  to deal with in a few more years. you got lots of mistakes to make yet so just remember to enjoy yourself now while you still young enough to do it, be honest with yourself and learn from your mistakes. <br>  if you don't feel happy without a girlfriend then who's to say you are going to be happy with one? you need to do what you want to do don't let anyone tell you what hobbies or interests you should have and get on with your own life. <br>  p.s don't be desperate to get a girlfriend, enjoy being you and it will all just fall into place|`|pXDok9MMaa	Just do your own thing.  You will find someone that will like you for being you.  Trust me, drinking has nothing to do with people seeing you as fun or attractive.  Be patient, be yourself, and you'll find someone.

But let me tell you what you SHOULD NOT do. DO NOT ignore him to get the message across. I say this simply out of fear for the guy, because as a guy I can tell you that being ignored and not given a reason is a thousand times worse than being outright rejected. Tell him you don't like him and let him get over it. It shouldn't take too long. Just please for the love of god don't avoid/ignore the guy. Oh and if you tell him, it'd help to let him know you don't have a problem with him, you just don't really like him that way. He'll be fine.|`|rrdseKJIaa	aa,notice him 4 some more days.if u really think he likes u,just say i hv a bf,or casually say sometime that 'i dnt like having bfs u know.i hate boyz who propose me'.i think that'll work!|`|vPXS1zK5aa	Pout- get him hungry...
BI6iR0wjaa	maybe she doesn't feel alone with you. There is nothing better than being comfortable enough with a person when you don't have to talk all the time!!!<br>  <br>  When this happens again, just take her hand and squeeze it softly or take her in your arms but don't say anything. Eventually it will make both of you feel comfortable and you won't have this incessant need to speak all the time!!|`|Flp6vXaNaa	In the most communicating relationship I had, we NEVER ran out of things to talk about.  Sometimes we would just play games like 20 questions, you can learn a lot about someone that you have been with for a long time just by asking a question you didn't know about them.  It can be fun, and it can be informative, and a question could lead to a huge conversation or debate about something you never knew you had in common.  <br>  Another thing we would do along the same lines is we find ways to compete against each other in some game... Who can think of the most songs with peoples names in them, or names of places in them, or what quote is this movie from, and you take turns answering until someone wins, and the person that loses cooks dinner or has to do an activity that the other person enjoys more.<br>  Hope this helps!
e232166370ff94d78e94215e4b9afd12aa	Well, my man is 33 and I am 47. We have been together for 7 years, so naturally I knew him when he was 30. Funny thing about age, it is just a mind set, a number, an attitude.  Even though I am the older one in our relationship, its like he is older than I am !   He is mature in his outlook on life, he is stable in his job, he is a good saver of his money, he is patient and thinks carefully before he speaks. He is loyal and he is a deep thinker. He is the most mature man I know and he was when he was 19,......I know because I knew him then also. Summing up, I think it is attitude which makes a person mature, yep, attitude.|`|orfmhb2waa	when i was 20 or so i was wild and crazy and had almost zero common sense , now i am 35 and a totally different person , i am boring and i love it , i am happy to wake up every day

I suggest you try to talk to her as nice as you can before it comes to the time that you are too fed up with that style, unless of course you like it ...relationships is about trust and respect.|`|U3tZzGlgaa	Absolutely.  When you have a crush on someone, you want to be or speak, or in your case, text with him/her as much as you can.  It just shows that she is crushing on you more than you on her.  Give it time and she'll cool down.  If the texting really bothers you, then just call her and talk to her instead.  An hour's worth of conversation will replace a day's worth of texting.  If you like her a lot, don't tell her to stop texting you.  Girls are sensitive to comments like that and would take it to mean that she is bothering you too much.  Picking up the phone and talking to her more is your best avenue of approach.|`|oitdhF7kaa	Yea dude,she is in love with you. You cant find that everyday! Feel good you arent dating some girl that never texts! She wants to be with you,thats all.<br>  But if you really want to get her to stop without breaking up..lol..fight fire with fire.Start texting her all the time but make your texts short.Like make a sentence like 7 texts long.

Yeah. That's definitely normal. It means she's thinking about you. If you get annoyed with it maybe just say you need to do something (but don't say 'something', actually put a thing in there) and you'll text her later. But make sure you DO text her later, even if it's just a goodnight.|`|5LhBXMM8aa	as you discover later on the relationship,    she         is           going           to                      nag                            you                               to                                    death.<br>  <br>   Although naggin is pretty much what they do best, BUT !  relax, the text is just a normal phase; just dont reply as much, she will slow down.|`|Y8EDyBrNaa	yes.

hqbt98QIaa	Text her? Try talking to her. Texting is pretty cowardly, that won't get you many points with her. Girls like guys who are willing to take chances and are outgoing. Even if you make a fool of yourself time after time in person, she'll like you more than if you text stalk her.<br>  <br>  Also, I know that this situation is all you can think about. It's all very consuming and feels like its life or death... but that's adolescence. It's normal. You'll feel this way about a dozen different girls over the next few years and a few years from now, you'll go off to college and barely remember their names. Don't let it make you crazy.|`|aAcjC22gaa	Go ahead and text her if you think about her that much you obviously like her so just tell her and see where it goes from there.

Its better to give people space and time to miss you. (like maybe one letter a week)You might have made him feel smothered or something. <br>  <br>  (all guys think of the one we like most before we sleep every night anyway, it means we naturally miss you everyday if we like you)<br>  <br>  If he still likes you, things would be fine if you just copy him. Dial down the attention you give him. Not too much, not too fast.<br>  <br>  It also does sound like he wants to break up with you because he's not interested in a relationship where he doesn't have his "own space".<br>  <br>  As for something to suggest you do, do something on your own, focus on yourself and stay busy. Give him around 2 weeks of casual to minimal attention then plan something that you both will enjoy. <br>  <br>  On the date, try to let him know that you don't mean to smother him if that's an issue, talk to him about where you guys are in your relationship and what each person expects but I don't think talking ever solved anything. (You could just use your women's intuition while on your date to see if  things are still good) If things are going good then keep it up.<br>  <br>  If you are more in love with him than he is with you initially, make sure he has a chance to catch up before you smother him.(in fact never smother tease him)<br>  <br>  Learn something from this if the guy does go

P49Ie95xaa	Yes, he is a controlling boyfriend. And if he ever becomes your husband things will turn worse. Married women normally say that the true nature of their lover is relieved after marriage. Until marriage men usually try to be kind and patient but after marriage things change. It will be the same with your case. Believe me continuing a relationship with a guy who doesn't respect your choices, privacy etc is going to be like living in hell. I know you made the mistake in the first place. But it doesn't mean you have to suffer your whole life (being his prisoner). People make mistakes. It is their very nature. Forgiving , understanding are the qualities I will look for in my partner. Anyway remember the most important thing in life is happiness. Love has no value if it doesn't bring us happiness.  I will forget him if I were you.|`|iNpgfW4haa	Girl, get out. Be honest, if one of your mates came to you and told you this about her bf, would you tell her to stay with him?<br>  Just because he's your bf doesnt give him the right to control your life.

You should just sit down with her and explain how you fee. Or take her somewhere romantic. Girls like when a guy is honest and when they are straightforward. Because if you do not tell her you might regret it, later because she might think that you do not like her and she might find someone else you should do it ASAP. You do not want to look back one day and say, what if… and if you found out that, she likes you then go for it. She is waiting for you to do something…but what ever happens you know that you tried. However, I think that she does like you and she will be very happy once you tell her how you really feel.  <br>  I hope this helps good luck <br>  God bless|`|TU34il8Taa	hey communication goes a long way and trust me if she likes you she will think it is cute that your being shy ha ha so just tell her and see wut happens. dont wait becuz girlz like u from 1 day to a week then move on if u knew she liked u and she knew u knew then if u dont do something shell move on|`|D4C8Uxenaa	u cant say im a little shy  but im in love with u, it might confuse her depending on wat type of girl she is. u got to go for her now u never know if someone else wil come and get her dont be fraid u can do it|`|9qndirR3aa	Aww ! <br>  you sound like a really sweet guy and she would be lucky to have a guy like you.

7PGxqRfZaa	Well it does sound to me that you are being a little selfish, but Its to be expected. I think you should back off a little bit. He is over worked and stressed out and by having to lisen to your problems only makes it worse. I think you should try to make new friends when you can. If there nasty to you, then move on to some one else. If you keep piling up this stuff on him he will leave you. I don't want to see that happen. I want you to be happy. If you need some one to talk to, you can e mail me using yahoo. I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. I don't have a computer at my place. I can only use the one at work. I hope you have a better day today. Give him some space to work his life out and good luck.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Yes you are being selfish.If he does not complete College he will work like a dog for next to nothing and will be dirt poor the rest of his life working 2 jobs  and you will have to work too.<br>  Next, if all you do is fight ,fight, fight all the time, I see a break up coming because no guy after working the hours he works, likes to go see hid g/f and get b-tched at the entire time.<br>  You said you don't have many friends and the ones you do have is nasty.Try being anice person,stop the cussing, show you care about others and that will change.Also pick a better class of friends.Try church hon, you'll find people there do care about you and will love you.|`|0uSPPAb5aa	If you keep being so needy you won't have him! Its not his fault you can't get along with anyone. Plus the fact he has a mission more important than you . He is doing his best to succeed ,It also sounds as if hes doing very well at it. Why mess with that ,If you keep being so self centered instead of asking how he is and giving him some breathing room you just might loose him. Nothing stands before a man and his pride.
86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Don't worry too much about the dreaming.  It's not because you were meant to be, it's more because you are on a bit of a downer and constantly thinking 'if only'.  Make a positive plan to change your life for the better and stop getting hooked up over something that you know is just a fantasy.
LS8LcuRaaa	You need to talk about your feelings with her. Sometimes we realize after a few years that we are not meant to be and go separate ways. Before making such a move, however you should really talk about your concerns and try to find a solution. Communication is key.

You never know what he'll do with those.<br>  <br>  Just my 2 cents!|`|hIrBZS3oaa	It's normal, however for future reference, have your face excluded from the photo.|`|orfmhb2waa	i have seen nude pics of thousands of women , it is no big deal.<br>  <br>    are you other posters puritans or something.|`|stj3AQG7aa	Its normal.<br>  <br>  Its also normal to not want him to have them after you breakup.<br>  <br>  just tell him nicely that you'd prefer it if he did not still have those pictures, and out of respect for you, he should delete them.|`|pXDok9MMaa	Well, first of all, you probably shouldn't have taken the pics.  Second, just wait and see if he posts them.  If he does, threaten him with legal action.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	Till the day you die, these pictures will be out there.<br>  <br>  Never ever EVER take those pictures for a man. Never.|`|zgQZJUHwaa	Yes.. it's normal<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|hJZWMkFZaa	well be prepared to see yourself naked on some sort of website, get those pics back as soon as possible girl|`|FzFSzilmaa	you dumped him for no good reason...<br>  <br>  of course he's posted them online... most guys dumped in such a manner would post them on the websites for ex-girlfriends... :D|`|E638ukebaa	Ouch, I'll guess only time will tell.<br>  Next time I guess you'll think twice, my lady and I have taken pics and video etc, but it gets deleted after time.
DcVoq5Tuaa	As long as your mother is of sound mind, she can do whatever she pleases with her money. If he throws a fit over it, she should just cut him out all together. I would tell him now so he knows what to expect and doesn't drag your through the courts trying to overturn her decision.|`|2MVG5StDaa	get all the legal paper work completed as soon as possible to do this.  Don't tell them anything about what is being done. <br>  <br>  If you tell them now it will only serve to cause a great many problems.  You have to get the legal paper work done first before you tell them anything otherwise they could create problems legally by challenging you as manipulating your mother.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying it will happen but the brothers could actually accuse you of criminally manipulating your mother to gain a larger share of the inheritance.  It happens everyday in this country dozens of times every day.<br>  <br>  just get this done using a lawyer and a will being drawn for that living trust, and thus it will save one heck of alot of issues in the future. <br>  <br>  You've earned a larger share of the estate by virtue of what you have done over the years to assist your parents.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't sell the house i'd keep that for you too live in until you pass away.  Giving the others 100 thousand upon the death of your mother is sufficient.<br>  <br>  I actually thought you were writing a page out of my life as i've been through very nearly the identical situation.|`|HwjYCfLJaa	Try to tell them now, but don't let your mother hear too much about it. You don't want to treat her as if she's already dead. If you wait until after she dies, though, your brother may accuse you of being sneaky or underhanded. It's best if it's out in the open from the start.|`|XimQM11taa	i think that is an extremly lovely thing of your mum to do and i think you are a great person for helping her out for all this time. the things you must of stopped doing to look after your mum you deserve a bit extra. i would explain to your mum that you dont know wheather to tell them or not. then let her explain to them surley they are not going to go mad at her. if you dont say anything we she eventually does go (hopefully not for a long time) you can just think of the good times instead of having an on going family fued witch nobody wants. things may be abt tense for a while but eventually they can get over it and every one can move on. hope i have helped you good luck in what ever you choose to do x|`|xEtrTRtXaa	Well I think that you shouldn't tell them until your mother is good and ready to spill the beans. Do they know that you know what everyone is gonna get? Because when it's announced after your mom passes away, you could always just act like you had no idea. But yeah, I think that you should get a little more because you have been there for your mom and have taken her places, and your brothers haven't. You really shouldn't feel guilty about this. You deserve it.
ds6lmTIAaa	It's not always easy. Don't smear them with a bunch of gushy crap. If you do really love them and you speak straight from the heart, you will have no problem conveying your feelings and convincing them of the same. If you have trouble saying it, write it. Women of all ages still love receiving letters.|`|Lr75hENEaa	just tell it to him.or look him in the eyes|`|x7uYAPaSaa	Tell them. Sounds stupid but once you start telling someone how much you love them everything just seems to come out naturally. Well it does with my boyfriend!|`|5DLxtZSDaa	hit em in the face...............with love.
NxRlxe7taa	I′d either talk to her about this and/or stop giving her anything.<br>  It′s the thought that counts, whether or not it′s real gold shouldn′t even be an issue!|`|GDbiZxH1aa	don't give her any more gifts, until she thanks you for them.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	show her the receet <--spell wrong<br>  <br>  or just talk to her about it
GGAgxzJNaa	Get her a card, regardless of what your family says.  They must realize that "making the effort" means nothing to your mother.  There's no sense spending your money on an expensive gift for someone who doesn't appreciate it.  Maybe if the gifts stop coming, she'll learn to appreciate it more.|`|1hcupwT4aa	Oh screw that. Don't get her anything.<br>  <br>  The fact that she has the nerve to say "it's fake" and not even give a thank you to a gift is downright rude. If I were you, I wouldn't get her a thing, not even a card. If she asks, say that you were tired of her ungratefulness and if she didn't want the gift then you just didn't bother.<br>  <br>  Jeez...|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would stop trying. She turns her nose up at your gifts, that is rude and uncalled for. I would have quit giving her things long ago. Tell the other family members to mind their own business. They have no right to voice their opinions on that matter to you.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	JUST GET HER A GIFT CARD, WITH A NOTE SAYING.. "YOU DON'T SEEM TO LIKE WHAT I GET YOU, SO GO GET WHAT YOU LIKE...YOURSELF"!!!!!!|`|7ciw1aCXaa	My ex-wife is like that. You are stuck, my friend. Sorry. Just make her a cake or a card or something.|`|vFlUT9Zzaa	Have you ever tried making her a gift? Maybe she'll finally realize that you do put a lot of effort/thought into her gifts, that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sbaUUjhTaa	My mom's the same - we take her out and she says she would have been happy with takeaway.  We have takeaway and she says its boring and she would have like to go out!  Your mom relishes the fuss you make over her - the more she turns her nose up, the more fuss she gets.  Stop making the effort.  Give her a card then walk away so she doesn't have an audience for her performance. Sell the necklace (if she asks about it ask her why she wants a 'fake').  She'll never change.
AA11108897	It's very romantic to think that money doesn't matter.  But the truth is, if you have financial security, you'll have less stress to strain your relationship.  If your bf loves you, he will want to support you and take care of you.  You have responsibility to support and take care of him, too.  I think you should talk about how you're going get by in life, especially if you want children.  (I'm 40 yrs old)|`|ENSGrZAqaa	Im 26, and if your boyfriend is smart he will get his high (school?) diploma!!! That is going to be sooo important especially on this economy. You quit high school and you might as well kill yourself (not seriously of course). You wont be able to do anything. People with a lot of education are taking jobs that are beneath their level of expertise just to have a freakin job! The other people are on unemployment or just scrounging for the scrapes. <br>  <br>  Anyway...love and money are two different things, love. But marriage, love and money are tied together. To live you need money, and that includes living together as a couple. I wouldn't want a partner that couldn't support himself. What kind of life would you have?? You would resent him for not getting his act together. My bf is very hard working and ambitious. He works full time at a business he and his dad created and he goes to school part time and earns a 4.0 GPA. In this world, you need to be ambitious to live a decent life. Love is wonderful and important, but if their are money issues..well a lot of divorces happen because of it.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Not necessarily rich, but security is vital to any marriage or union. When you are very young love is an ideal and can be enough for a time, but as you age you have to have security, meaning, being comfortable. I am 60.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	25 - I would take love every time.|`|uuMCGT9taa	im 23 he is 28 and we live together and he doenst work i support us to the full and its really hard and my family sees it and they dont like it but you gotta remember its not what people dont like or do like its what you LOVE TO BE AROUND and i love to be with my bf i moved out so i could fall asleep in his arms and wake up first thing and kiss him with morning breath.   my bf doesnt work because of his record he does try to look for work and he baby sits his friends kids for a little bit and gets paid for that but he is always cleaning house and waiting on me hand in foot and rubbing my feet and back.<br>  <br>  its all about the love<br>  <br>  i toldmy bf when we where homeless literaly homeless that i didnt need  a roof over my head i just needed him to keep me warm with his love !|`|pOTigVYPaa	I often tell my husband that no matter what happens to us in this terrible economy, if he loses his job or has to work for less pay, nothing matters as long as I'm with him. I've told him that if we had to move out of our gorgeous home and move into a trailer park, our trailer would be the prettiest because I'd make it adorable.|`|pDrkcc6taa	You have to have love and respect to make a marriage, but unfortunately in this society you also HAVE to have money.  You don't have to be Oprah rich to be happy, live life and be comfortable, don't make your expectations and envy of others rule your and his life.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I don't care if I am living in a cardboard box but if I am with my husband, that is all that matters.  I am officially the happiest woman alive.<br>  <br>  Money can be gone in an instant (if that isn't obvious with today's economy).  Love doesn't depend on anyone else but the couple.  Definitely choose love.
EUsIDbHsaa	haha I love that you called it sexy-time! Well I wouldnt do it again, unless you enjoy someone watching you.  But I would close all your blinds next time.  It was probably some guy walking by and he saw you two and was curious and just sat and watched.  I know plenty of people who would have done the same.  But that is very creepy.  Just be more cautious next time!|`|iP863XM6aa	Well, killing the person is deffenetly a bad idea. Chances are, the person didnt just come around once just to be in the film.. they've probably been peeking in for a while now. What i would do is just set up your video camera pointed at the window non-stop until the person comes back so that you can get them clear on tape. After that, just take the tape to the police and let them handle it. <br>  If you take a gun on the guy, then your the one who's gonna get the bad end of the situation with the law, not the stalker. Just try to catch the person in the act with a camera and let the police handle it from there. Dont do anything youll regret later.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	cant you zoom in?<br>  and as long as you arent underage, what you did isnt illegal so you can go to the cops and get a face recognition done.<br>  <br>  but if you dont do that, then just make sure to shut the curtains everytime next time, he was probably just a nosy perve.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...maybe next time just shut the shades and use some commen sense I suppose....what else?<br>  Do you recognize the individual?....have you seen them before?<br>  Window peeper I presume...especially with all the noise and what was taking place in the room you two were in anyways.<br>  What did you expect them to do otherwise?<br>  ...LOL!!!...|`|AA10266072	That's creepy as all hell!!!<br>  <br>  That's why you close the blinds.|`|y76ZHadsaa	haha, wow.. that is quite creepy. i would def have someody watch outside next time. not with a gun. but, just to see who it is. you should def do something about that.|`|eZj1qCd7aa	That is pretty creepy! Lol I but I don't think he wanted to do any  harm. Maybe he just wanted to watch some porn... I wouldn't get a gun maybe just get someone to watch out side for him. Or you could get your video camera pointed at the window so you can see him if he comes back. Using a gun on him will get you more in trouble with the law. Just try to identify him and If you don't know him then let the police know.|`|jxeQWLpWaa	lol just look around the neighborhood for him...and once you find him just tell him next time he needs to buy his ticket in advance!! haha|`|Jhr68T0baa	haha you got caught out!<br>  maybe next time get some blinds? or shut the curtains? <br>  thats scary though,|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Creepy!  Lock your doors and close your curtains.|`|WpAsonqtaa	lol creepy! i suggest just closing the curtains or try it in a different room ;)
qSsLPBo3aa	Wow that is confusing. Well since you don't see him all the time. Why don't you just come out and just tell him. He might like you, you know. He might have just said that he thought of you as a friend because he might have thought you just liked him as a friend and nothing more. And came to terms with that. <br>  <br>  Or it could be possible that he doesn't like you either, that he just cares for you as a friend. <br>  <br>  But while you were smashed he didn't have to cling on to you too, there were other people there LOL.<br>  <br>  So i say you go up to him, or call him LOL, and just say plainly hey i like you... And yeah just see if he feels the same. Unless you just want to shrug it off, and just keep wondering forever if he liked you back. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  =D
aDL7xmt6aa	You're an adult and capable of making your own choices for the path forward.<br>  If you meet him and don't like him at least you tried.<br>  If you don't try before he dies you may well live to regret that decision.<br>  Choose wisely.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Leave well enough alone.  It takes two to make a relationship, and I think you are going to end up very hurt if you pursue this.  Good luck.|`|AA11024148	some things are better left alone.<br>  you are probably better off without him. <br>  sorry  you lost you mom at such a young age. you are most likely a strong woman. the kind of woman your mom would be proud of. <br>  keep your head held high and keep true to your own values.|`|4ESlizXraa	My mother and I do not get along.  We have history that just isn't something we can put behind us.  My father died when I was 5 and I was raised by my grandparents.<br>  <br>  Still, I do make an effort to stay in contact with her because she is my mother and I don't want to feel like its me that is making the relationship impossible.<br>  <br>  Were I you, I would at least meet the man and talk to him.  I wouldn't want to feel, years down the road, that I didn't make an effort.  If he doesn't reciprocate, at least you've honestly tried and don't have to deal with the feelings of "I should have made an effort".<br>  <br>  Just because he's not the father you wanted doesn't mean he's not your father.  People are flawed, give him a chance.  If he doesn't use the opportunity, that's on him.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I wish you well.|`|UtR6D3UZaa	i have never seen my dad i only see my mom during the summer and sometime christmas.|`|FzS3aphWaa	We didn't see my dad for eight years, since we were 9 and 11.  We invited him to graduation and he came but his girlfriend complained about how much effort they put into attending (1/2 hour drive).  He now emails every couple of months (maybe 2-3 times per year) that he wants to phone us and talk about our lives but he never does.  He admits that he chose not to speak to us as it made his life easier with his girlfriend but doesn't seem to care enough to make the effort now.  <br>  <br>  If your dad is still drinking he has not changed from the person that your mother kicked out.  As least you know that your mother did what was best for both you and her even though it made her life much more difficult to raise you alone.  I wouldn't waste much effort on developing a relationship with this guy.  He sounds like he doesn't care about making any kind of effort - about you or about improving his life.|`|wLRDxrI4aa	If you dad is still drinking and living a life of alcohol abuse, don't expect to much.  Go ahead and see him, so you can have closure and let go  that guilt of 'never trying'....Once you meet him, then it is on him to make the next move...You were a small child, the victim in a situation you had no control over....Don't let him give you a guilt trip now, because he is angry and alcoholic to boot.  You do whatever will make you feel better about yourself, but you watch out for you, keep yourself<br>  as your number one priority.....Take care....Linda K.|`|ovtt1L1Naa	I haven't seen my mother for 25 years she has asked to see me, but I decided not too. It is difficult but look at your life and decide will this person improve your life or not. My decision was easy she was only interested in me as she had heard from my brother that I am doing well and I had invited my brothers and sister to my holiday house. No one has a good word about her either. I have a nice life and didn't want this woman around. Maybe do a list of plus points and minus points on a piece of paper, sometimes the writing things down makes it clearer.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	He doesn't seem interested so I would say to just let go... unless you really have this deep need to see him.  If so, I would meet him in a public place.  My mother was a alcoholic and she was not nice to be around drinking... she always thought I should save her when she got evicted or whatever.  I would say not to let him in because he could end up ruining your life.|`|kE8psnNCaa	I would say go ahead and meet him, but leave it at that. Just so you can have some kind of closure for yourself. Leave it "up to him" to see if he wants a relationship with you. This is the only advice I have for you. Good luck.|`|AA11682594	hello please allow me to answer this from a long absent parents perspective. i didnt see my daughter from when she was 18 months old until she was 18. <br>  she called me and asked to meet up. we did meet up and it was odd. i kept feeling really bad about what had happenned in the past and it got in the way of us getting to know each other properly for a long time (5yrs). now we get on well but more like friends than father and daughter..<br>  guilt is a terrible thing and you may be reminding him of what he was in the past.<br>  remember he called you back and he didnt have to so he has some interest. <br>  he doesnt sound like a very secure person and as an adult yourself now you must try to assess him like you would people who arent related to you. you say he was an abusive drunk and imply he may still be. ask yourself the question if you have only heard one side of the story (your mums) and she will have coloured whatever you saw when you were 7. people can still drink and be perfectly calm and decent.<br>  nothing can be lost by meeting up with him but make it somewhere neutral and keep it light at first.<br>  good luck i hope it works for you..
g3JiJWyvaa	If he doesn't take you seriously, there's no future in the relationship. The thing is though, he may take you seriously as you are now. If you've never shown him your thoughtful, mature side, now's a time to start. Eventually you'll get older, and I'm sure he knows this. What I recommend is making it a balance.... don't stop being energetic or youthful (at least not yet), but every now and then, slip in a few mature conversations. Most men like women with minds, and if he can't respect you, he doesn't deserve you. Here's another thing to ponder: Does he really think of you as a girlfriend or a guaranteed date and/or sex? If he doesn't see the deep,adult side of you it will be difficult for him to truly see you as a serious girlfriend. And if he does see you as a real girlfriend, he probably takes you seriously.|`|AA10126871	I think he already takes you seriously, you just have a more lighthearted sense of everything.<br>  If you want to act more mature to things, then pick what you want to be more mature/serious on.|`|QHqGpJZ5aa	Just be yourself. If you like being young/energetic/playful then just stay that way.<br>  <br>  Don't feel like you have to change for him. Be what YOU want. If he's not gonna accept you for what you are, then forget him.|`|HdCo22Ggaa	its not immature just act how you are comfortable basically you if he doesn't like it it really isn't worth it if you have to change for him|`|BgAm4PESaa	If he shows that he likes you acting playful, then i wouldnt worry about it.  I am sure if you take some time to be serious he'll understand also.  Everyone has there moments where they're crazy and wild, and everyone has there moments when they're serious.   If he likes you how you are, really dont worry about it.|`|5R0MdDENaa	yea. its called being immature.|`|JJCSEe3Taa	It good to have a youthful energy because we all need to hold on to our youth. Just keep a balance of sophistication and energetic.

hkwBR1moaa	Is there a David's Bridal around?  If so, I suggest there.  They stock plenty of plus size wedding gowns.  If there is not one of those around, I would say whichever dress you chose, buy it a couple of sizes bigger.  They tend to run smaller and you can always alter down.  You can't alter up.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  DOn't go strapless... I'm plus size also and trust me, you DO NOT want to wear a strapless dress.  Very Unflattering.|`|DCXss6Odaa	You will need to try some one, it's so hard to know what will suit your body shape.<br>  Have a think about what parts of your body you love, and find a dress that makes them even more beautiful!<br>  =)<br>  Congrats and good luck!<br>  x|`|7G4hisdzaa	Buying a dress online is so brave!  I couldn't do it!  Most bridal shops here carry gowns in a size 10.  Um, excuse me, we are not all size 10s!  The good news is, if you find one in town that looks beautiful, even if it doesn't come close to fitting, they will order you one that does. <br>  If you do buy online, remember that wedding gown sizes run differently.  My street size is a 0, my wedding dress was ordered in a size 4.  So please check the size chart and make sure you'll be getting one that fits!<br>  Also, check the return policy and google for any reviews. <br>  Good luck!  I'm sure you'll look gorgeous!|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	I don't know if you have a David's Bridal, that's where I bought my dress. <br>  I think you should look through wedding dress magazines.<br>  Also, you might have to go to a seamstress and have your dress custom made. <br>  The seamstress might also be able to give advice on what dress would be more flattering for you. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congratulations.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	My dress size after it was fitted was a size 20.

I ordered it in a bigger size, and voila..."BRIDE". It was perfect, and the first dress I tried on. Believe me, you don't have to order in "Secret", brides come in all sizes and are never shunned away at a bridal store.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Before making my choice I had to go find it in store somewhere, even if not in my size to look at it, because pictures can be decieving, I made up my mind what styles looked most flattering, what materials I wanted to narrow down the choices I looked at. I am very happy with my decision|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	Definitely go to a bridal store and try on different kinds of dresses even if you dint think you will like it. When i found mine i saw it on the rack and hated it and when i tried it on i loved it. Also if you find the dress you like google it and maybe you can find it cheaper. I would not buy a dress online until you have tried some on in the store so you can see what fits your shape but good luck!!|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Find the closest place that carries your size (probably david's bridal) and try things on.

There has to be somewhere nearby that either stocks samples or would be willing to help you find some so you can try them on.

Like everyone else said, I would go to David's Bridal just to try on styles and GET MEASURED!!!!!!  When you find one you like, you can go online and order your dress confidently.  Just remember if your exact measurements aren't given on the size chart, always go with the size that has your largest measurement.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I would not recommend buying online..i mean if you get it and if you like it good for you...but most dresses we think we love on the picture or online are not usually the ones we pick ..<br>  I was almost 99% convinced I will buy my dress online, but then decided to go to a store...and OMG what a difference...all the dresses I though would look good on me...didn't..<br>  so I was open to try anything else..and ended up loving 2 dresses that are not what i had pictured but they look soo good..<br>  you should go to the store..and try some dresses on...even if they dont have your size..they didnt have mine but it gives you a good idea of what it would look like when you wear your dress...<br>  <br>  You will thank me for this..try the dress on before you buy it...:)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|480c8670c97d5544350aa8b11691f73caa	I'm not sure where you are at but I'm sure there is a Davids Bridal within 50 miles of you (www.davidsbridal.com) You can pick out the dress you like (they range from like size 0 to 16 & 14W-26W. they also do alterations there to have your dress fit YOU just right. you can also shop and such on the site|`|y8B6mXspaa	<a href="http://www.plussize-wedding-dresses.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plussize-wedding-dresses.com/</a><br>  <br>  How about this one?i search it "plus size wedding dresses" from yahoo.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well try printing the pictures out and then making your mind up on which you think is the best fit and style for you|`|KqxQlPrNaa	ROAD TRIP!!!!

It's pretty sad when a guy has to spread stories and talk himself up just because a girl didn't like him. <br>  Honestly, just ignore him, pay attention to the people who matter - the people who are really your friends - and ignore the rest. <br>  Besides, am I the only one who noticed he called you ugly and a sl*t? I mean, how does that work?? <br>  He is obviously just working through his feelings of rejection by lashing out at you but it's not your problem, it's his and if you ignore him for long enough he'll get over it.|`|qJK4alwQaa	too much drama. you sound like you're 11 and should be on a different site|`|9mHYXrRJaa	Cullen you really should just ignore those brats, you need to tell them that they are brats and that you thought they where your friend.

y4w6ybr3aa	I have had ex's do this, even if you dont fall for it, they still do it and it's just a big fight.<br>  Thankfully, my current boyfriend does not do immature things like this.<br>  There are good guys out there :)|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Every man does it like every woman calls a man "Immature" or "insensitive" or whatever.  We are all guilty of trying to deflect blame in some situations.  And sometimes, a person doesn't actually see that the situation they are in IS their fault and truly believes that it is the other person to be blamed.  It is human nature to naturally want to protect ourself, whether it from physical harm or emotional.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	When my husband and I were first married if I wanted to do something that my husband didn't he would say "You just want me to be whipped."

My ex boyfriend and current bf. They are sweet guys and I cant imagine they would have ever said that to a woman. Certainly not me!!|`|AP2e90cCaa	In my opinion - every man does this in an effort to deflect blame from themselves - my husband included.<br>  <br>  And no, I don't still fall for it.|`|HNOPVOvmaa	women are nags controlling clingy they cant be responsible for there actions men can admit they are wrong!!|`|HMFR1I01aa	Not really. none of my exs ever did this. and my current boyfriend hasn't said anything about this. I once told him that i don't like calling him all the time cause i don't wanna be clingy and posessive, but he thinks that it's better for me to call him and he wouldn't mind if i'm clingy when we're together. Different guys got different minds! If the guy actually puts the effort into the relationship, then there would be less problem suchas claiming his gf as clingy. If the guy just neglects the girl, that may be one of the reasons why she's sticking into him.|`|61Fwbi79aa	Every man does this from time to time. So does every woman. Its human natuer to lash out when they are in distress. But it still doesnt make it ok.
IvMPh09baa	To be honest, if you are throwing insults at him and constantly telling him you are not satisified and its not enough you have completely depleted his ego.  You stripped him of all his confidence in the bedroom, so why would he want to have sex?  When he does have sex... he just gets told by you it wasn't satisfying.  <br>  <br>  You are playing a major role in his lack of sex with you, you are creating insecurities in him.  So honestly... I really think that you need to change your attitude here.  tell your husband how much he actually does satisfy you, tell him what you like, what turns you on... stop berating him and putting him down.<br>  <br>  I really feel bad for the guy... no one deserves to be told they are horrible in bed, and I am really shocked you said that to your husband which you will be having sex with the rest of your life... if you love someone you better take care of them, othererwise he will find better.  and frankly, he deserves better|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well do you stay at home most of the day? If so then you problie don't feel like you have to get dressed up that you can stay in your pj's all day. Also if its the same thing wham bam thank you mam then hell its just boring. I don't mean to make it sound like it's your fault but i went threw this same thing with my wife, i would work all day and my wife would stay home being a stay at home mom, she would just stay in pj's and not really give my that umph when i got home. She is a beautiful woman and all but tinker bell pj pants and a long pj shirt and no bra did nothing for the sex drive. Also if its the same thing he has to imitate it of you initiative it with a fight, or just jump on its not that great. Try changing things up like you go up to bed early and jump in to something sexy and wait for him to come up then just pleasure him with kisses and teasing, even oral sex then have sex i bet he will be after you more after that. Also try getting dressed like you all would go out some where some times a little change in life will make a huge change in the bed room. I have been married over 10 years! and my & I have sex 2-5 times a week. We make time for us to just have alone time and go see a movie or go bowling to just have fun. It seems he is just bored in this life style at the moment try and change things up.|`|AA10824151	Gee, when you do have sex and you tell him thanks for nothing then how is he suppose to like it? Don't you think you would have been better off cuddling, kissing, and thanking him? Maybe even telling him he was such a stud than running him down? Try figuring out how you can make it better for him first. Then maybe you can bring the romance back into the marriage.|`|ULUpOqplaa	When men get married part of their brain shuts down.  MRI's have shown this.  Part of what shuts down has to do with sex.  Not sex in general, if you paraded naked women past him he would jump at the chance, it is just sex with you.  To him you are becoming invisible.  Not much you can do about it.  For yourself I would find a good swingers club.  They all accept unattached women with open arms.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	7 weeks is a long time. Does he find sex boring, have you changed a lot over 3 yrs, is he stressed? If he won't tell you the problem i can't see how you can fix it.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I seduce my husband every chance I get usually and talk to your husband again make sure he is not having an affair on you and maybe get him some horny goat weed|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I don't know.  Anyone who is not interested in sex is a mystery to me, which includes my wife who is like your husband.  <br>  <br>  Maybe we should send them away to tasmania together, where they will not reproduce.  If all the sexless people were sent together to a far away island, they would eventually die and the rest of the world would get overpopulated by the rest of us copulating fools.<br>  <br>  If my wife berated me for sex like you did to your husband, I'd love it.|`|ERWcMfldaa	Here's one thing that might be your problem.  Rather than be kind and patient with your husband last night, you let him know loud and clear that you weren't fullfilled and you punished him by sleeping on the couch.  Do you think maybe that was the last thing he needed from you -- to be "rated" poorly and punished for his performance?  You think he's going to look forward to having sex with you again?  It sounds like you both need to go to marriager counseling.|`|a1uoxczTaa	try making moves on him... if u arent already. i usually wait for my boyfriend to come to me but lately he hasnt and his reason was that he wanted to c if i would make a move on him. it aggravated us both that whole time because i was mad he wasnt makin a move and he was mad i wasnt makin a move. but now we have great sex lol|`|AP2e90cCaa	My husband does the same but it doesn't last as long as 6-7 weeks.<br>  <br>  Ummm, try opening up with him. Intimicy is about more than just the physical. He may just be bored, which is normal - not your fault - I'm sure you feel that way sometimes too.<br>  <br>  Invite him to share his sexual fantasies with you and share yours with him.|`|FkJobxmGaa	sounds like the problem is his...find out whats wrong with him maybe he feels insecure about somthing instead of  just knockin' boots engauge him in foreplay maybe open up his perspective of  what love making truely is and if that doesn't work  maybe he is having an affair|`|vnSPbshNaa	see you are his wife n  as what marriage is concerned about the mutual understanding...so you should understand ur husbands problem...don't take them seriously...act wisely  n be calm ... if you are not satisfied then ask ur partner to cooperate... sure he will try to make you Happy  n feel better....|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Let him know what he won't do somebody else will. If he doesn't care then you got permision to step out. Why waste your time begging him? You can't make someone want you that doesn't.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Well, I guess, nothing turns a man on like, "Thanks for wasting my time," and then sleeping on the couch....  Just decide that you are going to have an honest conversation with him, and agree that you wont get mad at his answers.  Could it be that you've put on some weight?  Like it or not, we are visual people, and that could be the reason he isn't interested.  I lost interest after my husband lost interest.  When he was interested again, I wasn't.  He never wanted to honestly talk about it, we stopped talking about it, and now we are going through a divorce (for other reasons).  So, consider his thoughts and see if you can work through this, together, or through counseling.  Also, is he overweight?  That could contribute to his lack of interest.  He really has no energy.  Good luck.|`|qU2RbKWfaa	Then these guys wonder why women get even|`|R7qaqlrXaa	I'm sorry this is happening, but just because you haven't had sex doesn't mean he's cheating.<br>   There could be many things going on that can screw with your head and not be in the mood for sex,like stress,job,just about anything....... anyway this is happening a short time after being married seek some help either both of you or just one at a time and figure out what to do. You got married because you loved each other,figure out the problem together and make it work, sleeping on the couch will not get your questions answered.<br>   Good luck.
fpGroPpzaa	Let him know he's being needy and that it's unattractive. If it helps, great. If it doesn't just tell him you two can't hang out anymore. It's noble to be upfront with someone.
nCWjdyddaa	What a great guy this is! Someone needs to talk to him, though, and make sure he knows what it means to sign that birth certificate. If he does, and the other father never shows, he will be the legal father for the rest of the child's life, with all the responsibilities. That means he will raise the child as his own. <br>  <br>  There is a bit of a sticky situation. Depending on which state they're in, if they should split, and the boyfriend calls for DNA to prove he's not the bio-dad, he could be off the hook for child support. Then she'd be left to figure out how to care for the child. It might be better for her to determine paternity right now and get a support order in place. Tell her to see an attorney.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	If they do split and she wants child support...he can ask for a paternity test!! If the possibility is there that someone else is the father..take care of it now..get the tests etc. and put the baby as #1. Good luck to them, and congrats to the guy who wants to step up no matter what!
968KfJjqaa	Well, seems like a quite difficult situation. Your parents aren't very supportive either. I think you should try having a real talk to them about your sister, if they won't listen, then go to a friend for a one or two days, to get away from your sister for a while.|`|AA10874773	the first thing you need to do is stop picking up her slack.  if she's told to do something & doesnt - dont run & do it for her.  let her hear about it from mom or dad or whoever.  maybe if the school had to call mom because sis didnt pick up your sis, she would do something about it.  you need to concentrate on what YOU have to do & let your sis reap what she sows.  good luck!|`|pWqkGJl1aa	yell backk at her and tell her shes a lazy b**** andd ughh that made me mad reading it lol|`|FQeSo65Haa	I have a similar problem, except that I'm actually the lazy one. I don't understand why you neat people need to make anything neat, but let me give you some advice from the point of the lazies. Us lazy people are happy to keep not cleaning up things and letting neat people clean up our messes. I mean, I don't mind messes as long as it doesn't get in my way. It's selfishness. As long as I don't mind not doing something, I don't need to do it. The people who get bothered by that stuff should do it.<br>  <br>  If your parents don't mind, why should you? The best thing for you to be is to STOP HELPING, STOP CLEANING UP AFTER OTHERS, maybe then they will appreciate/acknowledge what you do. Let your sister do it or take the blame for not doing it. Right now, you're just encouraging her laziness - She's probably thinking, "Oh well, if I don't do it, my sis will do it for me, like she always does." You need to teach her not to take you for granted.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Stop covering for your sister's mistakes. Let her clean up her own messes for herself.|`|UZ8wsmuFaa	Sometimes it can be hard getting other people to do their fair share.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people are not lazy on purpose. If you clean up after them or get mad it can sometimes encourage them. You keep your area clean and let her live in filth. Maybe offer to clean up with her e.g. get her to wash up and you can dry and put away. <br>  <br>  maybe have a spring clean together and make it a fun thing. Inviting some hot boys to help might grab her interest. Find some way of making it fun. Dress up in crazy outfits while you clean up and take pictures. Make it into a fun thing somehow.|`|ZVGbONH9aa	Wow, not a good situation.  Clean up after yourself.  DO NOT clean up what is supposed to be her responsibility.  You're only encouraging her poor behavior.  <br>  <br>  p.s. a good cry will release any stress and avoid a smack down in the living room between the two of you.  Smile a big smile and that will eat away at little selfish sister.. <br>  <br>  God Bless|`|7YtfJKE2aa	Beat her with a stick.<br>  Or, completely ignore her and take a nice relaxing day off. Calling your parents irresponsible sometimes helps too.<br>  Good luck.|`|AFxvchCFaa	Dont do your chores or her's act like her, and when your parents ask why just say well you let her do it why cant I|`|0gn8VI2aaa	Beat her senseless, put make her want to do them. Make sure she knows her place.|`|bRcwqYhiaa	what a btch!!lol<br>  go and smack her right now lol.. dont do the chores she's meant to do leave them i think she's needs a good smacking show her whose boss when mum n dad aint around lol|`|DUjr9tNUaa	You should ignore her and cast her out.|`|oZXxDEnBaa	Not fair|`|Wgm4oKiqaa	OMG! I have the same problem my little sister always thinks shes a kid so u know wat u should do u should just clean wat u have to clean and wat she needs to do leave it and evenually she will feel unconfortable and she will clean up if ur parents say clean up tell them that they treat her like hes still little wen shes 15.They have to start teaching her how to be resonsible.!!!|`|23bgwpD1aa	Move out when you are old enough too.

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	The truth is you never fully know what the other person is feeling or thinking. You can only make educated guesses based on their behavior and your hunches. It's normal to sometimes question things - we always want to make sure we made the right decision, so we might mull over other possibilities - but if you're having persistent doubts that won't go away, if you feel that something's not right, you need to listen to your gut feeling and figure out what's going on. It's not easy to read people, and, what's worse, it's not easy to read yourself; just like with anything, you need practice in sorting through your emotions and identifying what it means when you feel a certain way. Sometimes doubts may be nothing more than inability to read your own emotions (regardless of who the other person is), and the result is confusion. As you get more confident in making sense of your own inner life, you will become better equipped for making judgments about other people and their feelings about you.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Some people are really good at lying or not keeping it real. they go through life lost and pretty much end up unhappy.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	No, I don't think a person can always know.  We want to believe that we are such perfect soul-mates with our s.o. that we are bonded and stuff...but real life seems so much more complicated.
16b306f00a8eed0cdd3e6f4dcef7e891aa	Tricky question, <br>  <br>  I think your sister needs to set some boundaries on the interogative roommate, just tell her she is tired and cant talk right now, or she needs some privacy.  Also remind her that people who are needing to know everything usually dont have much of a life themselves or are studying for a life in the secret service,   The less she makes of it the better, and the semester is almost over.<br>  <br>  As for you sister's habit of telling others how she feels, this is not a bad thing, she does however need to keep it respectful and always only about herself.<br>  Good luck to her, I think many people have encountered this problem, it stems from other people's insecurities.|`|55e321b4f973cef3b697eb1c485c1345aa	girl i do understand where ur sister is coming from caz i'm just like that too and i had to learned  it the hard way but the is key is stopping for a second and think bout it and  then say it to yourself  first and if it sounds good then u can talk to the person|`|yyIVrngcaa	Just tell her to discuss with the roomate her past, uncomofortable experiences with nosey/disrespectful roomates .

I feel bad for you, i know it is very difficult to face the situation.  stay focus, you know that he have moved on and happy therefore let it go.  One day someone will give you the love the attention the caring that you deserve.|`|fqboOITjaa	Well first of all the people who are writing back to his facebook are probably friends who have a one sided opinion (from him) on your relationship so for all you know he could have been telling them he was miserable. <br>  <br>  Second of all, you have a child and need to make him your priority. Focus your energy and love on him and try not to be so angry because it's exhausting. Believe me I know! <br>  <br>  You say his family didn't call you, do you have your own family who you can talk to? Blood is thicker than water so their loyalty is with him now I'm afraid. <br>  <br>  Chin up, if you get on with your life and try get over him you'll meet somebody soon and then you'll be wondering why you ever gave your ex so much thought!|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	It takes too much energy to be that angry.  all you are doing is depriving yourself and your little boy of happiness.  Here is the thing about it, as you said he walked out, you had no idea, but the people saying he deserves to be happy, he must have been venting his unhappiness with the relationship to them.  Bottom line, everyone in life deserves to be happy.  Get past this and try to turn the lemons into lemonade.  As long as you continue to be angry, you won't attract positive people in your life.  Pull it together, and begin making yourself and your son happy again.|`|a4e3eca7c39a8a159579096ad5d3f546aa	how old are you i will move in with you am 29 email matt@team-tigerracing.com|`|4ef6b305b6cff20b521058d32c81a179aa	HEy first of all suicide will never do you good! I know how you feel even though i'm going 15 this april. I know it is something that is very hard but never blame yourself everything that happened because it is not your fault that you loved the person with all that you can give. Yes he really does not deserve to be happy cause if he is he is hell. how dare he ruined your life. <br>  <br>  it's really hard to move on and it WILL take sometime to get along with the situation you are in. I hope you stay good and loving and i wish you will be able to find your true love..|`|BrYMh9pRaa	Hi, there are some very sincere help messages here. I can't do any better than some of them, but I'll try to add a little more help.<br>  Don't let this s**t ruin your life and your beautiful sons life. You can cope - show him you can cope without him. By coping - you are the winner, he is the loser (imagine what a real s**t this guy is, by missing out on your beautiful son - his loss, not yours) and as someone else said, someday another far nicer person will enter your life, and you'll be happy once again. Please stick in there. Bless you - good luck|`|RlgGkQjqaa	Oh hun, i really really feel for you what a dick!!! Whats worse is that he isn;nt helping you with your son is he?? so CSA springs to mind, get some money out of him, please dont do anything silly you have a son he needs you, do you think you could find a little part time job, you would get help with benefits that way when the csa get hold of him at least you would get the money. 5 years is a long time and 5 months is a small step to start mending your life, getting out there and thinking you know what f##k him dust yourself off, go to college, meet some other mums. i was a single mum at 23 he went off with a younger woman, it takes time. write a letter as if you are going to send it to him, tell him what this has made you feel, dont send it to him just get it all down on paper, keep it put it away write down his good points bad points and see if the bad outway the good. im sure and you are a beautifull strong woman and you will laugh your *** off when it all goes **** up for him, at least you are not jumping from one relationship into another. get him to step up to the plate and help take care of your son. he has a responsibility. you will meet someone who deserves you and you are still young hun. If it helps to see your GP get some counselling. there are tons of feel good websites it helped me. it will get better, i really feel for you but hang in there girl, you will be a far better person and come out much stronger... good luck|`|b80Zhg6Uaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your situation... I know it must be very hard.  The only thing you can do now is move on and make sure you and your son have a happy life because you deserve one... As for the jerk that left you... Hit him up for some child support. He has a responsibility to help take care of your son... There are programs out there to help single moms get on their feet and be successful... Go to college and get yourself an amazing career that will provide well for you and your son... You'll find a good man one day, it may take a while, but he's out there. Spend time with your friends and family and focus on making your life a happy one. I know everything sucks right now, but it will pass. I hope I helped... Good luck, I know it will all work out for you
ze7xiJwTaa	What does she say when you ask her? I work in a lab/garage automotive environment and I am VERY hard on my rings. I scratch the heck out of them. Plus I've never been a real jewelry person so I never got used to having something on my finger. Thus, I would play with it a lot, and take it off at my desk (and sometimes in the lab). I had a few scares where I left it somewhere overnight, or forgot where I set it down so eventually I didn't wear it to work. My coworkers were all well aware that I was married :) and my husband didn't mind me not destroying it at work. I always wore it when we went out.<br>   <br>  Another thought...has she gained weight? If I gained weight I would feel claustrophobic in my ring, like it was going to get stuck. Maybe you should ask her if she would be more comfortable if it was sized a little bigger?|`|rFMRgHTdaa	That is weird ask her. Maybe she thinks that the actual wedding ring should be on the finger and the engagement ring around the neck so that people can see.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Keeps the tan line off her finger when she goes out to the bars.|`|egpVC6uMaa	I wear my ring around my finger because I want everyone to see that I am married...if I stopped wearing it on my finger, it would be because I want others to assume I was still single and not have to deal with the tan lines either.<br>  <br>  Ask her...she might have other reasons.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	Because it bothers her , especially when she does dishes and bangs her hand on a door.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	Some people find rings uncomfortable. Or she may need to have it resized but still wants it near her.|`|AZB4BV64aa	umm tell her??|`|DzAFT8VDaa	These 'modern girls' kill me.  She might be making a passive aggressive statement about feminism, or she might just like it on a chain.  If it bothers you, talk to her (in a non-blaming way) and find out what is going on.  If she isn't a traditional girl, you fell in love with her enough to ask her to marry you, so you'll have to accept it.  Good luck.|`|Gbln5NyZaa	Some people just don't like rings on their fingers.  They slip off easy, or are sometimes too tight.  Women often wear rings as necklaces because it looks nice, and it decreases the risk of loosing it.  Don't worry about it.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	What kind of work does she do?  Would it involve maybe losing her ring?  Maybe her ring isn't sized right.  Have you asked  her why she does that?|`|V0qntsyZaa	Get it back and have the stone reset into something for your mother.  Your (not) fiancé feels no commitment to you.|`|ZEitfScGaa	I've never heard of that. Most women would be proud to wear it, especially if they are newly engaged. Weird.|`|xgvPCQXsaa	It sound she cheating on you are don't want to be with you.   She could on a necklace
bS3f0f1paa	Well I am someone who HATES cigarettes, and can't really stand the smell of them either. but I have dated smokers before. My current boyfriend thankfully quit shortly before he met me. But you just have to tell him how you feel about it, and not specifically ask him to quit, but to maybe try and not do it while he's around you. Most guys that I have met don't have a problem with that at least.|`|gqvvXknQaa	I would tell him that it bothered me that he wasn't up front. If he didn't smoke around me, then I guess things could work out. I'd still be mad that he didn't tell me upfront.|`|IVlsDTEqaa	i feel very strongly about smoking - i would probably stop dating him or make him stop.|`|qU2RbKWfaa	I think I would smell the cigarettes before he said anything|`|VFdC2wPlaa	No i wouldn't. Men who smoke don't value their health.... or else they would quit. I understand that quitting is very hard... but if you want to then you can.|`|f4gRedsqaa	probably not. it depends<br>  , if they just smoke at parties and wat not<br>  sureee i guess<br>  but if theyre going outside every hour for a smoke<br>  NO. they would be the worsttt person to date ever<br>  gross|`|7LJUGsqraa	yea if he was fit
nCWjdyddaa	The only thing you can do without letting them know you're checking up on them is to call their County's Family Services Department and ask them to check up on them. Other than that, you'd have to have their permission before anyone will tell you anything.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Contact them and ask ,you may be pleasantly surprised at their response|`|l2iK95pBaa	My dear Liz,<br>  Nobody other then U can take care of UR parents. The one and only one way is to take care of them by yourself. How? Its upto you. Ultimately, its them because of whom U are her on this Planet. Thinnnnnk.<br>  Regards.<br>  Arjun
qVL5R8nuaa	Something doesn't sound right. Filing a joint return should change the numbers in your favor. It should not be the same net $8K in both instances. Maybe you should consult a tax accountant.|`|AA11108897	Sounds like you're really selfish by just asking this question.  You're married, dude, nothing is all yours any more.|`|pOTigVYPaa	Not if you want to remain married.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	yeah sure that's not selfish at all.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Not if you're married.  Put it towards a common goal.
34ikhhtMaa	I love your list bec I feel the same way. We all have lists in our head, like what we want the guys personality to be like, but in the end there is no Prince Charming(wish there was) and no guy every meets everything on the list. If you joined a church group or volunteered somewhere then you might find a great guy. There are lots of guys that I have met that meet most of  your list(they definetly meet the only haveing 2 partners and most r virgins) and they all went to church or were volunteering where I was. So try that and you might not be single much longer!!!!|`|PMtqTW6qaa	i think you will regret the inexperienced. but it is good that you have standards. you are looking for a needle in a hay stack by the way. if you are going to be tuff and have a check list than expect it to be hard. my opinion is that you are being way to hard on how many times. i understand the sex partners but you cant hold how many times against them.|`|VAsTZ6mYaa	Don't feel ashamed. There should be more people like you as then there wouldn't be loads of unwanted children in the world. We all have checklists and they all vary, you haven't been meeting the right men though. Not every man has had more than three sexual encounters, there are some out there, you just have to wait and he'll find you.|`|Ub8arVLpaa	You have every right to set standards when choosing a partner, spouse, etc.  Go by how you feel.  If you find someone you care about you may want to alter the standards you have set.  There are many variables here, one is delving into someones past, being judgmental.  Listen to your own conscience and god luck|`|Puu5OMucaa	maybe you should broaden your horizons.<br>  get use to the fact that you may never find that guy whose fit that criteria.<br>  maybe change it to if hes clean of any STDs or how his last relationships ended. <br>  Sex isnt everything and men are going to have sex.|`|EJWphb88aa	Dont be so rigid in ur thoughts.. no one is perfect babes.. you just need to feel the spark with ur partner.. but i don think you will feel it if you have closed all ur doors of ur heart and binded with restrictions... <br>  <br>  be little flexible.. u never know u meet the prefect guy in ur life.. but u dont opt for him coz he is not fitting ur screening rules.. being choosy is good... but being an extremist in the same isnt healthy..|`|qUbJbu64aa	just be a little more loose you kno and be friends with their friends so u meet more ppl u mite like|`|YyiESOpFaa	i don't know if you find a guy that you like they won't have more then 2 sexual partners and stuff. it really sucks, but now -a - days people do it all the time and don't think about consequences. Either you keep waiting for the guy that fits your list, or change the list. you could even just get rid of the list. another thing that you could do that might help how you feel about a guy who's had sex more then once and with more then 2 people; you can have them go get tested.<br>  good luck!|`|242C9xnxaa	With a checklist like that u may spend the rest of your life looking for a guy whats wrong with an experienced guy? I'm just saying a guy like your looking for is not going to be easy to find. Who knows u could have turned down the man of your dreams already because of this mental checklist u have in your head. Good Luck|`|AwkEUHwGaa	Honestly you shouldn't feel bad about this. These are YOUR values. YOUR choices. Don't lower YOUR standards. The perfect guy will come along. Trust me.|`|MFe44e2qaa	i dont think this is all that wierd. it seems like guys who have more than that get a little obsessed with doing it like on every date. But if the guy is genuine and cares about you try to take that into consideration a little more before getting rid of him. Guys can be really sweet and when small things make them a deal breaker try to evaluate yourself. I see where your coming from tho...i have standards too. I dont lower them. When there is a super hott guy and the rest of him is unattractive u cant just overlook that. So yes..have standards but have standards for yourself too.|`|Un9CElCaaa	i have friends like u. stop being so damn picky. no one is perfect. give some of them a chance or youll end up like 2 of my buddies 30 years and complaining about being all alone|`|QePbhS8Caa	You are sabotaging yourself. Seems like you've got an issue somewhere and this list and your personal rules are just how you keep guys from getting too close. There's nothing wrong with having standards, standards are a good thing, but setting up a rigid list of qualities and dismissing anyone not meeting all qualifiers is not healthy. You don't want to miss out on something great because you let some hang up get in the way. Have you thought about maybe getting some counseling to see where this stems from and if you can work through it? I know it seems serious, getting professional help, but it's not really all that big a deal and you'd be surprised what kind of insight you can get into yourself and why you do the things you do.<br>  <br>  I was 21 the first time I had sex. I was in a serious relationship. We'd actually moved in together before we had sex. He'd had loads of partners previously, he was a sailor, but he hadn't been with anyone for a few months before he met me and since then, even though we were only friends in the beginning, there was no one else. When we first got together I was kind of uncomfortable with the fact that he'd had so many partners, quite a few of them bar hook-ups, but then I started thinking of it differently. For one, he knew what he was doing. I've heard plenty of bad first time stories from friends and family full of awkwardness and fumbling. Mine was nothing like that. He knew what to do to put me at ease and sweep me up in the moment. It's a warm and wonderful memory because he knew how to make it that for me. Secondly, I didn't have to worry about him wondering what it might be like with someone else. He'd had plenty of experience, been burned a few times, and he knew what he was looking for and took relationships seriously. Don't discount the possible benefits of an experienced man.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Nowadays, people are having more and more sexual partners, and at younger ages too. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, if you are going to stick by your rules of only 2 partners, then yeah, you might be single for awhile.|`|JwnHKTabaa	Keep your standards high.<br>  You'll find someone.<br>  <br>  Maybe join a church group, a lot of men there are virgins.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	Either dump the list in your head. Or ....you know...|`|angW1Lkfaa	Finally a girl that has some principles. Believe me it's better to be single then to be used and abused by some macho guy that doesn't know how to treat. Don't give your love make them earn it. You and I both know way to many men want one thing and could care less about your needs. Do you see how many questions revolve around abuse. Your not sabotaging anything your protecting your self from sorrow and pain.

AA11119636	why don't you ask him? =/<br>  <br>  no one knows if he's ignoring you or just too busy...|`|MSM66SEnaa	In my personal opinion, anyone who uses 'gf' and 'bf' to substitute boyfriend and girlfriend are too immature for a relationship anyway. <br>  Long distance relationships seldom last. Break up with him and start a new life, you're not going to marry him.|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	i would trust your bf if he hasnt given you a reason not to! but also look open your eyes and make sure hes not cheating on you with your friends and their just not covering for him for that reason... or if you have his parents cell numbers or just a number to contact them... you should ask them if your bf is okayy... he might be grounded..<br>  Good Luck!|`|xOX7yMczaa	maybe hes grounded....that happened to my boyfriend back in highschool. man that sucked. dont you hate freaking out over boys? im glad im single right now. im loving just worrying about myself and no one else.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	if you havent made him a sandwich im pretty sure hes ignoring you|`|h4TxVSp3aa	Probobly ignoring you|`|uhN7WmXhaa	I thought you trust him,why are you so paranoid of thinking something.If you are worried,then go to the school where he is.Inquire about him on that school what has happened to him why he does not call.Relax girl.|`|3L0OSuQYaa	Don't jump to conclusions.<br>  Men [not all] tend to be lazy assholes, so maybe he just didn't have energy to turn his phone on.<br>  But then again, if this persists for longer than a week or two, something is not right.|`|bdzG1VEDaa	Whatever the reason he is being selfish for letting you worry!|`|s0tj0Yt8aa	Who knows, guys are so rar!|`|FKQvRZhXaa	maybe he likes your friend =] and she is just trying to hide it from you.|`|3eCcTT7Caa	a giant monkey ate the dude|`|CpevWaQ7aa	He's prob just busy. You have nothing to worry about.|`|MKKx1luSaa	He's busy no need to trip|`|GYobl7Xtaa	somethings going on in his life, go to his house and ask him whats wrong and try and help him
nSUHvlyaaa	just ask her if she wants to go get dinner with you sometime, or go (mention an eating area). Everyone's gotta eat, it's foolproof right, i mean you can already tell she wants you to ask.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Ask her out plain and simple or ask a question with a question like "would u ever date a guy like me" that always gets a confession
0LEFco9xaa	He might be after you because of the I want what I can't have mentality or he might try to see if your making it up that you have a bf. If you want to be friends with him there is nothing wrong with that but you need to set boundaries if you have no intention of getting back together with him. When you flirts with you need to make sure that he knows its not okay to flirt. You could do that by ignoring his advances at first and if he doesn't get it maybe you should talk to him about it. Before you go in to it you might want to say something like I think its great we're getting along after we broke up and I really like being friends but I've noticed some mixed signals from you and see where the conversation goes after that. Hope that helps. Good luck.|`|rHwHAItGaa	Because everyone wants what they can't have.  It's always happened that way for me.  I finally get over an ex and move on to a new potential relationship, and as soon as the ex finds out, they're back on my doorstep acting like they're still insterested in me.|`|LlcGLYlJaa	he is just seeing if he still has you.. he wants to see if just by hanging out if you will go back to him! its a confidence thing! My advice is dont go because he probably doesnt have just as friends in his mind.|`|AA11119636	you want what you can't have...if you had a bf YOU wouldn't go out with him alone to the movies...i don't think the BF would approve of that <br>  <br>  maybe he wants you back...and you're leading him on (even tho' he says things like I just want to be friends)<br>  I'd just leave him alone...and only have phone or email conversations with him for awhile...to let him know that you only wants to be friends and nothing more......flirting is leading him on !

Midbg5BJaa	Ummm...<br>  <br>  Condoms for making out?! <br>  <br>  I think you need to hit the biology books.<br>  <br>  As for the embarrassment factor- if this is the worst thing that happens in life, count yourself lucky ;)|`|ruczpWrGaa	Ok don't smack your sister,  that will just make things worse.<br>  <br>  As far as your sis taking a video of you kissing your girlfriend, just be the mature one and tell her you didn't appreciate it.  That's all.<br>  <br>  And the thing about the condoms.  If that was your first time kissing a girl, you don't need condoms.  Condoms doesn't mean you can make out anytime you want.  Don't worry about the condoms.  Your 13, you don't need them.  Just spend time with your girlfriend and if you kiss her then you kiss her, just don't take things too far.|`|06ed225c555fb7afe18161cf019ce5ffaa	You sound immature and so does your sister. If she makes a video of you making out with a girl then it only shows her immaturity, and your reaction to this situation shows your immaturity and it doesn't sound like you're ready for a real relationship. Also if my gf's bro smacked her while i was making out with her i'd beat him bad.<br>  <br>  Also, you don't need condoms to make out.
PUumsOqBaa	Well i suggest you talk to your parents even if you hate them so, try to reason with them and tell them what YOU want and what YOU want to do because you carn't let them control your life because in the end you will regret it and you will be even more sorry for yourself. <br>  <br>  Try find a easy good paying job that you and your parents both agree with.<br>  Save money up to buy your flat in london.<br>  Love is their around every corner trust me it will happen soon or just later but you will find some 1 who you can rly depend on.|`|zkCnArG0aa	you have 2 options saying "hey im an adult and i can study and do what I want" and leaving then accepting the consequences but being your own person and happy <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  stay in the rut your in and live a life doing something you don't enjoy.  <br>  <br>  90% of people don't like their job but there is a difference between not liking your job and hating it.<br>  <br>  as for the no boyfriend thing your 19... they can't really stop you sure you might get kicked out but if they're that strict they'd probably get over it rather quickly and realize your an adult now.

If you "cheat" on a husband that tells you to, yoiu are opening a can of worms from hell.  You are the one who has to live with yourself and your choices, not him.  It appears to me that he is cheating and WANTING you to so that it can ease his conscious.  He can than say, well, you cheated too.  Why are you allowing yourself to be set up like that?  Just leave, get a divorce, and do it the right way.  Why lower you already low self esteem just because he "told" you to?  And it is not about "what choice does he leave you", it is about the choice you make as a mature, self confident woman.  So have some pride in yourself and do the right thing.  And being too shy to start an affair is just your subconscious letting you know that you better drag your feet on jumping into something that you may not be able to handle.  Maybe your husband is setting your marriage up for wife swapping, have you ever thought about that?  I just get the feeling, one way or another, you are being set up.  But after all, your life is what YOU make it.|`|6606e05490b3dda4a1a50ccc078bc327aa	Don't make the biggest mistake of your life.

For the short term satisfaction you may get, its not worth the long term guilt you may feel. If you've talked to each other properly about this you'll either come to the conclusion that you've no option but to move on or discover that there is an underlying cause which may just be able to be put right. From your comments you're an attractive woman who won't have great difficulty attracting another partner (if that's what you want). Do it on your terms and in the knowledge that you've done everything you can to save the relationship. You're young enough and smart enough to suss out what's right and what's wrong.

Perhaps you could find out why he has gone off sex and try to sort out the problem. If you really hate him (for other reasons, apart from the lack of sex perhaps you should leave him and start a new life on your own.

If you have ever had a day when you studied something so hard and thorough that it seemed like it took all day, but in actuality it was only two hours. That is how much this chick is digging you.

GBr9YngTaa	If you're okay with her dating other people, than yes have an open relationship. Remember you take the risk of her breaking your heart at the end. She could grow feelings for someone else or not have any for you through other relationships.|`|POHWTDPRaa	This open relationship sounds like it is going to be one sided. Are you sure you are going to be OK with that? Because that isn't an open relationship so much as it is you giving her permission to sleep around but keep you on retainer in case of a dry spell. How long are you going to wait for her to mature and find herself at the expense of your own happiness? Don't think that she is not going to use 'I am trying to learn who I am' as as excuse to run around for as long as she can.<br>  <br>  I think it is great that you are willing to do anything to hang on to her. You are trying to find a way to make it work. But you are the only one. Each person has to give in order for the relationship to work and it doesn't sound like she is doing any giving. Sleeping around is not going to help her mature and learn who she is. One has nothing to do with the other.<br>  <br>  If your hope is that she will grow up and learn to be in a relationship while continuing what is keeping her from being in a grown up relationship, you are kidding yourself. The only way she is going to stay faithful is if she stays faithful. It is not difficult. It just requires a little willpower and respect for ones significant other. And if she can't do it, she doesn't have much respect for you. If you are going to allow it, you must not have much respect for yourself either.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	To be honest the only open relationships that I have seen work is when one partner is bi and feels like they are missing something by being involved with only one sex.  Not that it can't work for the two of you, but tread carefully.  There can be a lot of hurt feelings, disappointment and mistrust.  Think about this carefully and fully discuss it with her before you make this decision.  She won't be the one getting hurt, it will be you.|`|1EqwONoNaa	No, she needs to grow up. Why would u have an open relationship, if you love her so much..do you think u could put up with her seeing somone else, while she is with you.. thats just asking for yourself to get hurt..|`|FSoNujAaaa	ok if she isnt faithful then you should give her time to find out what she wants i not saying wait for her because it might take her a long time but i am saying if someone else wants to get to know you dont push away<br>  <br>  <br>  *pArIs*|`|bdzG1VEDaa	No, it will never work if you guys want different things! WAKE UP, he doesnt love you enough!!! Get rid of her!|`|jUO9OTw2aa	If this young lady finds it hard to remain faithful. that would be problem number 1.( she is not relationship material at least not at this time) ,,,if you decide to let her mature in your arms you will probably end up emotionally hurt more times then none. I understand that you love her but sometimes love will make a fool out of you (they write songs about this very thing) you both are very young take it slow and remain friends give it a few years that is enough time to observe her and by then you will know if she has changed her ways.
aipChC3haa	It depends on the wedding.<br>  I'm having an elaborate OTT (over the top) wedding, but I still like short dresses better than long ones because I don't want the bridesmaids to over power me.<br>  <br>  BTW: YOUR DRESS IS BREATHTAKING!<br>  I saw it, and I was speechless, how beautiful!<br>  I love the details and everything!  Good lord, how beautiful!<br>  Looks like it is worth 10 grand!<br>  Absolutely breathtaking sweetie, good choice =)<br>  No way in the good lords Earth is that worth $400, it should be worth MUCH more =)<br>  <br>  Definalty the short one, it won't overpower your dress.|`|spiqVcg1aa	For that style of dress I like the shorter one. I also think it would be better because your bridesmaids could wear that dress again in the future. My half sister is getting married and she is having us wear long very formal dresses and I'm thinking about no being in the weeding because I am tired of paying for these dresses that I can only wear once. So be nice to them and let them get a dress that they may be able to wear again in the future.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Well if you want the bridesmaids to be able to wear their dresses again go for the short ones. But I prefer the long dresses more of a party, celebration dress. And I love yours.|`|V4NaOAS1aa	i like when the bride has a long dress and bride's maids have shorter ones<br>  by the way gorgeous dress =]<br>  by the way way congratulations and good luck!|`|CQsD09D6aa	Since it is a casual wedding short dresses may be more appropriate. Advise that they wear stockings. Nice dress BTW.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Since it's a casual wedding, I'd say go with the short dresses.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I think if you pair the short dress with a nice shrug or jacket, it would be beautiful!  A jacket would also keep them plenty warm enough!  <br>  <br>  I am getting married in July and am wearing a long dress, like most brides.  My bridesmaids are wearing a short dress.  Of course I picked what the Farmer's Almanac is predicting to be the hottest week of the year in my area to get married, so I want something that would be cool.  It's funny though, my bridesmaids dresses are techinically part of a the Fall 2008 collection, but it was available in much more summery color, and that's what they're wearing.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	My wedding was in December, and we had tea-length dresses.  It was cold outside, but inside it was well-heated so the short dress wasn't much of a concern.<br>  <br>  You should ask your bridesmaids what they prefer to wear.  I have a strong preference for tea-length purely because I am so tall that I have to pay extra to have length added to the gown.  Additionally, remember that short girls will require to have long gowns hemmed up (And it will cost more)  So for the me preference of tea-length is a cost/practicality thing.  One less alteration/cost to worry about.  Your bridesmaids, however, may have different preferences for different reasons.  Maybe you have one who doesn't like showing her legs?  If you have no strong preference, talk to them and see what they would like to wear.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	In October you can kind of get away with anything. If the wedding is outdoors, I would suggest a longer, maybe foot length dress, if it's inside, you should either do a knee length or calf length dress unless it's a formal wedding, then you could do floor length. Make sure the dresses you pick are sympathetic to all the bridesmaids shapes. Just because it looks good on 1, doesn't mean it looks good on all.|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	Well where do you live?

It has also been called "hypersexuality," "sexual dependency," and "sexual compulsivity." The existence of the condition is not universally accepted by sexologists, and there is debate about its etiology, nature, and validity. Proponents of the concept have offered varying descriptions, each according to their favored model of the putative phenomenon: Proponents of an addiction model of the phenomenon refer to it as "sexual addiction" and offer definitions based on substance addictions; proponents of lack-of-control models refer to it as "sexual compulsivity" and offer definitions based on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); etc. Skeptics believe that it is a myth that the phenomenon exists as a disease or disorder at all and is instead a by-product of cultural and other influences.<br>  <br>  see the rest of the article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_addiction" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_addicti...</a>|`|AA11119636	you got a prob. when you can't live without it<br>  <br>  when it costs your job, or your relationships with your family / friends etc<br>  <br>  when you skip meals etc. <br>  <br>  go see a doc or SA help|`|yB6Vg65Daa	You're only an addict if you think about it and want to DO it all the time.

Make some dinner reservations, dress up in your most revealing dress and take your man out to dinner.  During dinner you can flirt and make suggestive remarks, have a few drinks then take him home or to a motel and show him the woman you were 16 years ago on the special night.  Have fun and congratulations.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Be pleasant to him. Tell him how much you love him and what he  means to you (something nice). That should make his day. You don't have to do much more than that.

To me someone might be beautiful but to you they are "ugly". You yourself determines that, there isn't any set guideline or way to tell. Unless of course your talking about inner ugliness, whereas there are certain traits associated with it such as negativitey, rudeness etc.|`|5jMNBO2naa	that's each person's own criteria|`|N0rI6N9baa	if she has very bad eyebrows.|`|qJK4alwQaa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder|`|4k5AAm8Daa	YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO :(<br>  <br>  -sigh-<br>  <br>  <br>  it depends on the fucktard person judging them lok jk.<br>  <br>  uhmmm.<br>  <br>  maybe if they have a weird nose...<br>  weird facial features.<br>  <br>  i dont call people who are not my type ugly thouugh<br>  ex. if you like blondes i would not say alll brunnetts are ugly <br>  get it?|`|c9SmMYDDaa	Everyone has a different opinion.  All my friends think i'm strange 'cause i like the guys that they would call ugly.  So i guess that it's just personal opinion.|`|vR49RPMmaa	thats your opinoin.<br>  if you like green eyes and someone has brown you could think thats a bad feature, and someone might think it's beautiful.<br>  <br>  beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|huGTOQrwaa	Well personally that doesn't matter to much to me, but over all I would say by the whole face features. Where his eyes are and nose. The structure of his lips. that kinda stuff.|`|H61OKQJRaa	I determine who's ugly by their personality.<br>  The most gorgeous girl on the face of this planet could have the worst attitude.<br>  Then she would just be a plastic doll.<br>  Beautiful, but plastic.|`|ebwe0Duzaa	that sounds really shallow...um its about personality anyways (mostly).  everyone has their own views on what they think is ugly or pretty...|`|K119R72Caa	It's an opinion. You think for yourself,nobody can tell you|`|pnCYdBUuaa	The only thing that should ever make a person ugly, is if they are ugly on the inside.  It's okay if there is a person that you don't find physically attractive, but you should never think they are ugly unless they are a really bad person.  You can't draw a picture of a perfect person unless it's just that, a picture.  Physically attractive doesn't always mean that they are attractive to you on the inside which I find has more and more weight on who I seem to like.  Attractive and ugly both run a lot deeper than physical and the criteria people use to determine a pretty or ugly person will be completely different with everyone you meet.  That's a great thing in it all.  If a person's ever ugly, then the right person isn't looking at them! :)|`|dPicgCgwaa	Physical ugliness is very relative. It is only a judgement made in ones mind when they are in a situation with a certain group of people at a certain time. Your mind will break down exactly who you place yourself above and below (as far as beauty is concerned) and that opinion will remain until new members join your group. Often, you and some of your peers will reach anagreement on who is above and below you as well.|`|NiOlegDyaa	This is a really broad question, but there are two notable opinions regarding this. There is the point of view that existed for centuries that beauty is achieved when one reaches what they should be. The more modern opinion is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I guess choose whichever you wish to believe. I would suggest reading Plotinus (philosopher) for the former opinion.|`|HdCo22Ggaa	honestly it depends on who is looking no one is really ugly just different most people tend to solo out on the little things but honestly if a girl has a horrible personalty doesn't matter how many people like your looks wont be much of a meaningful relationship and it wont last long for example the girl that sits behind me in class is annoying and seems to talk at the wrong moments she isn't bad looking but her personalty makes me define her as ugly. but the girl that sits on the side of me isn't as good looking but is very cool and fun =p i would like her way more and never even think of saying ugly.  but as i said before depends who is looking many people like and don't like different things about people|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	I wouldn't say anyone is ugly. Cuz we all have our unique features. An ugly personality is what truely makes a person ugly. Doesn't matter how they "physically" look. It's all about the person you are and how you are around people. Like if your the kind of person you is kind hearted or sweet. You are usually portrayed as a beautiful person with a beautiful personality. A pretty girl could be so pretty but turn out ugly because of her damn stubborn attitude/personlity. That's just my opinion.|`|LKZlcjgVaa	WTF!!!?!??!??! whats wrong with people!! its like in the ond days when the nazis determined who was jewish measuring their nose and head size! how dare you ask such question! why do you need that! cant believe where the nowaday society is going, haha, determining the ugly, maybe we should publish a guide, or a series of steps for ones who are so interesting in that. find a life.|`|Eez1cQfEaa	Obvious obvios answer is what is ugly to you? Most people think that to be handsome or beautiful, you have to have a big bust, suave hair, or look like a model. It all is up to you if someone is ugly or not. I personally am ok with a plain looking woman, I mostly want someone smart. :)|`|8a4a476bcca8ee3b75075b29009d3b07aa	Everyone is beautiful in one way or another.<br>  <br>  Science studies have found that people prefer looking at symmetrical faces.|`|YyUCDprVaa	They r only ugly if they r ugly on the inside. People can be less attractive then others, but if they r good people then it shouldn't matter.|`|j9ZMsXu8aa	When you think someone is ugly you aren't attracted to their features or something about their body repels you.|`|4z3AtEcbaa	I figure out who is physically ugly after I figure out that they are internally ugly.<br>  Ugly on the inside = ugly on the outside.<br>  Thats my opinion|`|BgAm4PESaa	It's really just a personal choice, usually if there ugly on the inside they're ugly on the outside you just can't see it.|`|P3lNjcHzaa	LOOK AT ANGELINA JOLIE<br>  <br>  THEN LOOK AT THE OCTOMOM|`|Jl91LewOaa	jade guddy, she look like pig, just like most whi peo oooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhh<br>  <br>  <br>  ahahahaa!|`|AA10126871	Everyone has their own opinion on who is ugly.  Thats for you to know already, not us.|`|n1Rhv4s0aa	when you don't think there pretty and they have bad features.|`|2cJGHkMcaa	I don't determine who is ugly - I just determine who to me is attractive - it's like seeing sunlight reflecting off of the sand at the beach<br>  each person's perspective allows them to see different grains of sand that would likely be invisible to others - which might just appear as "sand" to someone else - someone even standing right next to them - appears as a blinding gleam if you're meant to see it<br>  <br>  We are not fit to judge that which we can not see from our perspective - if we're fit to be judgmental at all, which is likely not the case.|`|pMMBycO6aa	if you dont like them physically that must mean you think there ugly<br>  but in the end its not always physically that maters :S|`|uI4hUVU6aa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder, there is no standard.
B5MEqk8Zaa	hey, <br>  <br>  well i know this from experience (i'm a 14 year old boy). i say that you be less shy with him. hang out with him and his friends. talk to him more, things like that help a lot. Also don't be afraid to take it a step farther, flirt with him. do small stuff like leaning on him for support. all that stuff helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BfgB6l8Qaa	You should come out of your shell and talk to him.

QstEk6PZaa	He is looking. Too afraid/coward to post his pic, cause you or your friends will see it. I would make a profile, act like you are interested, fake name, and when he responds, you got him. Tell him "oh by the way, this is your WIFE" Two can play that game! Promptly get some marriage counseling after that.

Jeez we aren't him.|`|ebwe0Duzaa	he might love you in some way, but from reading that i get the vibe that he doesnt love you...he might have someone else and thats why he doenst like you to call.  the fact that you have a long distance relationship means that there is absolutely no telling what hes doing where ever he is and you have no way of finding out or knowing for sure.  i think you should end it because if he cant even take at least 5 freaken minutes of his o so precious life to talk to you and tell you he loves you and stuff then hes not worth it and really it may not ever get any better.  the relationship your in shouldnt be like that.  you should have someone who tries to be with you and talk to you as much as he can and makes it very clear that he loves you.  think about it really hard.  are you happy?  why are you with this person?  have there been more bad times than good?  you can get someone better...its not right that hes being like that.|`|miUJx4lgaa	Forget about it girl he is not all that into you.

And he's loving every minute of it, so don't expect him to change anytime soon. I suppose you could try to sit down and have a talk with your parents about how you feel, but don't get your hopes up. They might accuse you of being too "emotional" or "sensitive" and if they're set-in-their-ways, you won't get much understanding there. <br>  It seems like your family dynamic is already set in stone, and all I can tell you is that you need to find yourself someone else (another family member or relative? A good friend, perhaps?) who can give you the love, understanding, comfort and support that you need in order to mature into a well-balanced person. <br>  In the meantime, keep telling yourself, "they can't do this to me forever..." Good luck.
EgzoiW4raa	There is no right answer.  This depends on your relationship.  If you feel uncomfortable about the situation you should address it with your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Has he ever given you reasons to NOT trust him? Often times we project our insecurities onto those we love out of fear of losing them.  The fact that he respects you enough to call and ask permission must make you feel good, as well it should. In all honesty we do not need someones permission or approval to live our lives.  He was being thoughtful. <br>  <br>  If this still bothers you. Talk to him. :)<br>  <br>  Dr. Chambers|`|BeBEOFGxaa	it was good that he told you about it, which means that he doesn't have anything to hide. just make sure she knows that you guys are together, and there shouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  it was a little late, although. but it was just once, so i dont think there would be anything going on.<br>  but i think you should talk to him about this, but maybe he might get defensive. but keep talking to him an option.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|jxeQWLpWaa	wow...i think you handled it very well!!! just be open and don't let it get to you but keep your eyes open, some girls turn into witches when they want something they'll do anything to get it (now this might not be the case with you bf and her) but just keep an open eye on things and don't make him feel uncomfortable about telling you the truth about where he is going or who he is going with!!!!!<br>  Now if you start feeling uncomfortable and paranoid then confront him!!!<br>  good luck|`|mKD2g7xSaa	It would bother me, but trust is important in a relationship. If he's respectful enough to call you and tell you what he is doing then I don't think you have a single thing to worry about.|`|FSoNujAaaa	it is appropriate at lest he called you and told you he couldve just did it with out telling you they just went to eat,it is ok<br>  <br>  <br>  *pArIs*|`|4e0be5189dd654a42965404357096d76aa	i stay out pretty late with friends too.... so its no big deal... if you trust him .....|`|710c1b7cf50a6cc7849089b186c8f716aa	I understand that you want to be trusting but don't be an idiot about this. What you are doing is ignoring the inavetible. Tell him that it is no longer acceptable if he still wants to be in a relationship with you. If he tries to expalain that its nothing, you should walk. Relationships are like buses, they come along about every ten minutes if you want them to. If you want to take the local bus then take but if you want to the non stop through your journey of life then take that one. Sounds like to me that your bus is breaking down and that you need to fix it.|`|wBXYRbhhaa	I think that it was nice of him to ask. That shows respect for your partner. However just because you said yes this time doesn't mean that he can go ahead anytime and go out with female co-workers ... that's something that you should make clear to him. Obviously, find a nice way to tell him so he keeps trusting and being honest.|`|wCyhrvAdaa	uhhh..well i know if you were me imma be lyke hell no lol!! but hey, its alright...but late at night....iam not sure bout dat...but i would think it isnt a big deal but sumtin you guyz should talk about.....Tell Him how you feeel!! Dont hold bak, if dis getz to a point where he is constantly doing this every week or weekend...yuu should tell him how you feel. I dnt know how ur relationship is and how he is but i know if this was my man, i wuld tell him exactly how i feeeel. <br>  <br>  But if dis keeeps happening, you should confront him. :)|`|qpmGLd7laa	If he called you and asked, then I think you're okay.  You can always talk to him about it, if it's bothering you.  It's not unusual to ask to hang out with them at least once...  One time I met up with some girl at a library to work on our chemistry lab, and her boyfriend came and just sat there... Haha...  I thought it was funny, but I wasn't bothered by it; he wasn't doing anything unreasonable by being there.  But, unlike him, you might want to introduce yourself or something.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	It seems ok at the present time nothing to worry about but if it becomes more than just friends dump him like a hot potato and move on never to be seen again , too much hard work for the Mind Body and Soul . <br>          All the very best , kindest regards , cheerio .|`|AA11119636	you have nothing to worry about...if he's telling you wassup<br>  <br>  he's being honest with you ... you should trust him...even that girl is trying to hit on him...if you two are serious then it wouldn't matter<br>  <br>  if you feel uncomfy with that...then tell him<br>  but just remember you can do the same thing...with a guy friend and see how he reacts....<br>  <br>  it's just two friends hanging out and chatting...i don't think it's a big deal|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Not a big deal.<br>  <br>  Besides - I doubt that he had that much to say until after midnight.  He was probably getting laid.................|`|nSUHvlyaaa	hm maybe he just got carried away. Just as long as he doesn't do it again- at least not that late and not alone with her. If he does it again, then you should probably get involved, you know|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	i think if you trust him.. it is appropiate.. if he's always running around with other girls hooking up with them its not appropiate.. although you cannot tell him what to do...<br>  i don't see anything wrong with it.. but when i have a boyfriend i don't care who he hangs out with because if i'm with him a trust him.<br>  <br>  if you are worried at all just ask him if she knows he has a girlfriend.. dont' make a big deal about it just ask :]<br>  <br>  how old are you guys? and how old is she|`|a984cQjKaa	relax.  if something was going on, he wouldn't have called to ask you if it was ok if him and his female friend went to grab a bite to eat.  if he was banging her on the side he'd have just went and done it and you'd be none the wiser.<br>  <br>  work on that trust issue you have before it bites you in the ***.|`|zscuDpaIaa	I mean it is kind of weird they were out that late... i would like it better if it was more like a group of friends but he told you she was going to be there kind of thing.<br>  <br>  I'd probably be kinnda suspicious if my b.f did that. But that's nice he acctaully called and told you the truth, and who he was going with.<br>  <br>  Just  have a talk with him to make sure nothing is going on between him and her.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...you're both allowed to have friends of the opposite sex sweet sister...so long as everyone agrees to act and behave appropriately I guess.<br>  Trust is gonna be one of the biggest things you'll need to have for your man while you're in this relationship with him darlin....same goes for him.<br>  If this female coworker becomes a regular and constant burger type of meeting thing with him?...then you'll have reason to question everyone involved here...but not on a one time occasion darlin....cool?<br>  Good luck sister!!!|`|TPZZESeeaa	i agree with the 1st answer, i hang out with my female co worker all the time, she is a good friend. do you trust him?|`|1c6Jwbevaa	I always say guys cannot be "just friends" with girls.  If there is a chance for sex then the guy will jump at it whether he is in a relationship or not.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	The honest truth is a guy will not bother going to eat with another woman unless there is attraction there. Yea yea to the thumbs down but would he have bothered if she had been an obese 60yr old? no he would not.|`|69GgJhnWaa	Right, well that depends on you and your relationship. If you have a good relationship and a lot of trust, then it should be no problem. Ask him about it today. If he's willing to give details and tell you what they talked about, there really shouldn't be anything to worry about. If he gets close-lipped and gives you blunt short answers, then you may need to worry a bit. I have a lot of guy friends and we talk a lot. Basically, I've figured out most guys try to give shorter answers when they feel guilty about something because longer answers will leave them more room to get caught. If he's fine with telling you all about it and you don't mind, you're fine. I would remind him to be careful because she's single, though.|`|yyIVrngcaa	I would certainly feel disrespected....why would you need to take a relationship with a coworker that far? does she not have friends...why did your bf have to go that far as to taking her out to eat, she isn't his gf....especially at that time...its awkward...but anyway, he did ask you for permission to go out and eat with this girl, I doubt he'd be doing stuff with her while you guys are together...if he's a real gentlemen, he won't cheat on you. Then again, he could leave you for her if things ever got that serious.<br>  good luck*|`|bS3f0f1paa	ok. because he was actually honest with you, by telling you who he was going with and trying not to go behind your back about it, that it makes it a little better. But there is nothing you can do if you gave him the green light and told him you didn't have a problem with it. But you can maybe try to talk to him, and just tell him how it bothered you that it wasn't until midnight that he was coming home and what not. Just don't yell or anything to try and avoid an argument.|`|GBr9YngTaa	I spend time with my coworkers outside of work time and stay out pretty late. You really do get caught up in time. Honestly you don't have feelings for the other person, but it's just nice to sit and talk. I do have a boyfriend as well and my coworker has a girlfriend. Work is a great place for a friendship, so that's what you develop. <br>  <br>  He seems faithful as he called to tell you where he was going and when he was coming home. He didn't hide anything from you.|`|6eSRjnx4aa	It would be inappropriate if they went to some nice restaurant, because then it would seem more like a date. But what the hell is "whataburger"? Sounds like McDonalds Jr. to me. Don't worry, nobody goes to McDonalds and then has sex a few hours later. They usually reserve the time to run to the bathroom...|`|GZ9LjS13aa	Nah its nothing to worry about.<br>  You need to trust him.<br>  He probably will love you more if you trust him like you already are.<br>  Just don't let it get to you.<br>  If he does some how cheat on you and you find out, it won't be your fault at all, he mis used ur trust.<br>  I really doubt he will, some people just like to eat with other people. I got a friend for everything, half of them are girls. It is w/e.|`|a7VkyZLfaa	This is sounded wrong , no need for the co worker to go with him to have dinner or buy it she can do it by herself . Co workers only at work and if it was lunch ok this is normal . Dinner!!!! there is a big question mark a bout it .|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	i dnt think its inappropriate bcuz he told u about it beforehand, it wouldve been if he did it behind ur back.if the time dey spent together bothers u den ur insecure about ur relationship. but next time just tell em to try to make it home a little earlier|`|1jIzBUkhaa	it was nice of you to truth him . and you know there was kissing and so on . always happen. but next if you you love him , don't let that happen , you need to go with them. be with him at all time.|`|2db3d6c98dba468ccadc086e32f98f4faa	i would inevitably recieve a bad feeling about the situation, but as long as you trust you boyfriend then everythingw ill be fine. in my opinion, i think that would be fine, you should do that as well with your guy friends<br>  good luck!|`|GYjdHXueaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I have more to talk about with my co workers then I do my boyfriend sometimes. If I have to vent about work, which I usually do, they are more understanding.|`|BDjBVdtRaa	no its not. but try to go with them next time to get the point to her that he is your man and that they are only friends. but i think he is being honest. so i dont think you have anything to worry bout|`|PMChj7w6aa	I would talk to him about it, and tell him your concerned. If he was doing something wrong, he wouldn't have asked you. Also, maybe get to know the co worker?|`|r3v0oAabaa	i  think for now just dont think too much about this...but if he hangs out with her very offten then i think you'l can talk over this topic...u can jus tell him that ur feeling a bit insecure...<br>  but for now dont worry,atleast he cares and he is'nt lying abt this...<3|`|bdzG1VEDaa	If you have not met her before then I would be annoyed, yes. Why is the sudden "catch up"? Where is it come from? Did they do this before you guys went out? I find it odd...|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Id Say Yeh|`|s3m70L5qaa	As long as you trust your boyfriend, I see no issue with it. :)|`|GZn5VNlSaa	While some might say it's innocent, I don't find it appropriate for him to stay out that long w/ someone that is not you!!<br>  Even if the chat was getting interesting, he should have thought of his serious relationship w/ you and gone home. <br>  Does he work late, that he had to go out to dinner w/ a colleague?<br>  What kind of work does he do?<br>  How old is he?<br>  <br>  While i can see why some would say it's okay, i find it disturbing. <br>  Monitor him for a while.  Keep your guard up for a bit.
mvKDbb2uaa	Take it out of the bedroom.  Bedroom sex is great, but make it more exciting by taking it out of there and there are plenty of places to do that in the house.  Also invest in some toys and lotions.  We bought a Kama Sutra massage oil that's great for that.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Two bandanas.

MtbaNz5Yaa	forget writing her OB as that is a job for someone that loves her.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Does she not have kids you could ask? It seems rude for you to ask t her becase at her age she deserves respect. You also talk quite ashamed about her? Why are you writing her obit? An Aunt or Uncle should be helping you with this.
qMnuRO50aa	Just talk to him, if you wait too long then before you know it he'll be with some other girl and you'll have missed the opportunity.<br>  <br>  Just get to know him as a friend and stuff, and if you two 'click' then it will most likely go further than just friendship|`|ZJDQ1jTkaa	Are you in any of the same classes? If you are, try to sit by him or if you have assigned seats then look over at him all the time (not too much!) and smile then look away. He will start talking to you.|`|yyMtdbCmaa	I suggest just try talking to him. A lot of girl's have the reaction "I couldn't or I wouldn't know what to say" All you need to do is find one little thing that could bring up a conversation like maybe something on the homework or anything. After that just pop something in to keep the conversation going like about something that recently happened at school or about sports, movies,ect. After that you probably will have little converstations (a great way to get to know eachother) and if he like likes you he'll ask you out.
igI5yX0vaa	It is perfectly fine for a woman that age to want sexy photos.  Don't be sad.  It isn't like she's posting them on her facebook site.  She covered herself up with a coat so the public didn't see her.|`|LoO9LptJaa	you should definitely hint to your mom that posing in that way when you were supposed to be having family time was completely inappropriate! if she understands the way you feel, she should stop. if she doesn't, i would definitely tell your dad or someone else you can help you talk to her! goodluck=]?|`|9Kax4Kekaa	You have to understand that although she is your mother, she is still woman.  She has and will do things you will never want to even imagine, but there is nothing wrong with that.  You should not be sad, be happy that your mother still feels attractive and has not closed herself off to only being 'mommy'.  <br>  <br>  How do you know the pictures weren't for your dad?  I would say ask her and see what she says.|`|eMFYNGI2aa	well depending on what they shots were for...<br>  <br>  if you're mom is looking to become a middle aged model, then you better get used to it, or maybe she was taking special pics for your dad.  I don't really know the story behind it but I'd ask her what the shots were for, and if you felt uncomfortable being there while she was doing it I personally would let her know so that in the future she wouldn't bring you along.<br>  <br>  Sometimes (my mom went through this recently) when women hit middle age they stop feeling sexy and have to do things like this to make them feel better, my mom went all out and had naked pics, so feel lucky! lol|`|Y3HSXDRYaa	Hi Sameh, <br>       First of all, I do not think your mom should have brought you and your sister to the photoshoot if there WAS a possibility of that happening!

She was just feeling young and good looking! :) Have you ever watched a TV show 'Naked, and happy with that' were women over 40 with average build, some even with extra wight take professional pictures of them barely covered with something, and then show those photos on Time Square. I will say it once again... Your mother didn't do anything wrong! She is just a beautiful woman feeling young and fresh! You should be proud... And I'm serious :)|`|Jyw78OPeaa	Just don't jack off about it whatever you do. <br>  <br>  <br>  But seriously, tell her next time to not bring you to something like that and that it disturbed you.|`|QPdYQeUkaa	TALK TO HER!

Taking sexy photos isnt bad, but i understand where u might be awkward with it.

ed77b684631a15604ec6d6ba1f0a55daaa	It's not something that's suggested.<br>  <br>  As said above if you just casually slip his zip down, and your hand down there, I doubt you will get any negative feedback!<br>  <br>  But do start with that! If he's uncomfortable give him the chance to let you know!<br>  <br>  Then slowly move your kisses down his neck, and shuffle his trousers a little lower. Take it slow, and WATCH YOUR TEETH! It sounds obvious, but it's harder than it ought to be! Just kiss it first, then slowly take more as you feel comfortable! :) Do as much as you feel like, if you don't like it stop, and go back to kissing him, he'll take it as a treat, and if he expects anymore, don't say you don't like it, just give him a look saying that he was lucky to get what he did!

eNPcNGSjaa	She needs to figure out what she wants, and not you or her finance can help her with that.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that she is in denial.  I think she is trying to convince everybody else that she is somebody that she is not.  <br>  <br>  The only way she is going to figure out what she wants is to be by herself for awhile.  She is upset with her relationship with this guy because he doesn't make her happy.  You make her happy, but she is upset with your relationship because she would have to end her relationship with her family.  She needs to make the decisions.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Who cares if she is straight or not. If she loves you then she should leave him and be with you.

I don't think you can trust the teacher with your personal problems. If you could trust her then you would be able to keep on talking to her about your problems and she wouldn't tell the head. I think a counselor is best. I think you should stop talking to her and talk to someone who you can trust 100% and tell almost anything. Speak to your head or the teacher about seeing a counselor.

Also, if he abandons you then that is considered as divorce.<br>   In court, you mean American or Islamic court? I don't think an Islamic marriage in a mosque is recognised as legal in American law, but in an Islamic court you can claim that he has deserted you, you did not consummate it, and also he has not lived with you for however long it is. Basically abandonment.<br>    He also has to ask your permission before marrying, according to Islamic law. <br>    If you ask in the ramadan section under cultures and groups--holidays, you can get more answers there. good luck.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	you can get out of it because he abandoned you, call a lawyer and find out what you need to do where you live.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Have it annulled and count your blessings.

If you act in a mature, confident manner, only the briefest of observers will make this mistake.<br>  <br>  Stand tall, shoulders back, head up (yes, this makes your chest stick out....but that is very womanly). <br>  <br>  Wear clothing that is more elegant rather than "perky" or "fun". Dresses are your friend. Warm sweaters in the winter with designer shirts underneath. <br>  <br>  Don't overdue the make up. This is a little girl tendency. It makes you look like you're TRYING to look older. You want to play the part perfectly, betraying nothing. <br>  <br>  When you speak, speak slowly, clearly, confidently. Lower your voice slightly. Do not appear to be in a hurry to get your words out. Little girls jabber at each other. Women communicate and enjoy the experience.<br>  <br>  When you sit, don't slouch, don't hang your head. Don't lower your head to your plate. Sit perfectly errect, eat slowly (daintily). <br>  <br>  Practice looking relaxed, calm, and reserved. Little girls are frantic about everything. Bring about the antithesis of this. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ehAG30Yvaa	Who cares what other people think. You can't help what assumptions people might make because you look young but it honestly shouldn't have any affect on you or your relationship. If people have the nerve to ask or say something and you are offended by it, then let them know it. But don't let other people's comments bother you, it's not worth you getting all worked up about.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	You are right, people shouldn't assume things. When they do they need to be politely shown the error of their ways. The best way to do this, arch one eyebrow, stare directly at the person and state in a very firm, yet polite, tone "I am his fiance, thank you very much." <br>  <br>  It won't stop it from happening but it will give you a way to reply that makes you feel good. My daughter and her fiance have the same problem, she is 5' and he is 5'2". They both look like they are about 14 years old. They just love putting people in their places (politely of course) just to watch the erroneous ones squirm. It is hilarous!|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Deal with it.

When someone reacts such as he, there is something definitely wrong. The fact that he won't communicate with you his wife, tells me you know more than you're letting on. If he's depressed, he should get help. Is it the job,finances or what? Is he on medication? Maybe it needs to be adjusted. Yeah, there is something with a man who is married consults with his mother (whom he has issues with), but won't talk to his wife. Give him some space and time.

Except it is my husband who cheated/left me for her LAST Christmas (15 months ago!) and I still can't stop obsessing and dreaming about him! Both of them. And I have a steady boyfriend now. Therapy has helped. My therapist asks me to write down my dreams and explores them during our sessions. Your dreams are your subconscious and it sounds like you are still unresolved about things/her. Try writing them down and circle the key points (things that stand out to you in the dream). Research what some of those elements mean. Also, try working on grieving and forgiveness exercises. Believe me, I am not ready to forgive but the exercises have helped me to get my anger/pain out and stop obsessing so much. <br>  Sorry, what a crappy thing to go through.
eQ9FDcIPaa	Well the saying goes "Birds of a feather flock together." Not necessarily saying that hes a pothead too, but theres a really good chance that he does it too since his friends do. <br>  I think if you feel like hes keeping something from you, then your intuition is telling you for a reason. <br>  Who knows? if you break it up now, you could find someone that you like a lot who you can see more often.

He may be unimpressed - game playing is a huge turn-off to most men.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Well, in my experience I would say yes, there are also things you can do to check if this guy who looks uncomfortable does actually like you.  For example, like you said may be the case, check to see if he glances at you frequently, or gazes at you for a prolonged period of time. If he is just your friend, he might just give a faint smile with raised eyebrows perhaps. If he likes you, he will glance away quickly, so you don't think he was staring at you.<br>  <br>  You might ask why he doesn't want you to think that he was staring at you, that's because he doesn't want you to think that he is a freaky stalker or anything lol. Believe me, a lot of lads do worry about that, me included! If he was just your friend, then he wouldn't be bothered if you thought he was a stalker, in fact, it wouldn't even occur to him.<br>  <br>  Check to see if he messes around with you, teasing and stuff. Sure, friends do that, but does he do it more often than others? When he does, do you notice him look into your eyes while smiling and/or laughing? That proves that it means more to him, and subsequently, that he likes you.<br>  <br>  If that's what you want, then great! If not, then maybe you need ot distance yourself from him. But either way, just enjoy yourself!|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	it probably means that he likes you and is feeling jealous of the guy you're flirting with. if you like this boy though, you shouldn't play games. no one likes that.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|ENVkTHEsaa	It mean he prob thinks you interested in the guy you're flirting with and he wont come talk with you after that more than likely.|`|1FbuoLAcaa	He's jealous.<br>  Mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090309152237AAWR5nR">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|cm8G7AiCaa	ooo jelousyy lol|`|zkCnArG0aa	i don't really understand your question but if your with the guy it usually means hes pissed or jealous<br>  <br>  if your not it means he likes you or is jealous or uncomfortable or it can mean absolutely nothing.|`|gcUinRMaaa	He's either jealous or unimpressed.

0c0ywvuRaa	i once read an artical that talks about how over 75% of the time that men cheat not for the physical aspect we all jump to. Over 75% of the time it starts out as an emotional thing. Alot of times its that the guy feels like his spouse or gf is not giving him the emotional attention he wants and needs. ( the downside is its knda the guys fault bcuz we are afraid to ask for it at the same time ) But basically they end up flirting with another girl bcuz the girl either compliments him on: the way he dresses, something he did, or many other things. But with no intentions of it being anything physical with that girl ( sex, kissing, etc.) they just want attention from a female. <br>  <br>  So just make sure you give your man the attention he needs in every aspect.
lMKy9Ho8aa	call the authorities!! no child should have to live under those conditions. Your mother is a VICTIM of Domestic Violence and may be too weak to help herself, much less her own children! good luck. P.S. In 2 years, you will be 18 and can move out on your own.<br>  In the meantime, if things are abusive in your home NOW, call the authorities or tell a school counselor! Good luck and God Bless!!|`|6ztG71Zvaa	Firstly you sound like an intelligent young woman! This is a bad situation your in. no way should you see your father hitting your mother... You need to talk to someone about this... you are being denide a life which you so deserve.<br>  Is there no grandparents that you can go stay with for a while?<br>  The only advice i can give is to keep your head down at school, work hard and get good grades.<br>  Get a job then eventually get out of there, then you can be free to live the life that you want...<br>  Good Luck!|`|GUPA5tXSaa	try to wait till your 18 then you can get out of the house or try to get your lisence for driveing you can always say your doing something and go for a ride im sorry to here this is happening to you|`|jp8tIHFZaa	Try the Department of Social Services, not yahoo answers.|`|1vG4wNhpaa	First thing you need to do is report your step-dad to the proper athorities for abuse! Does he hit you too? You need to get him out of your lives!<br>  In doing so, if he starts hitting you keep reporting him! My suggestion would be to do the average things teens like to do but don't get carried away and if they hit you for it, report them for abuse!|`|7a7e8d64bb03c8b3656b04f99f5002f7aa	PLEASE GET HELP RIGHT AWAY!!!!! CONTACT SOCIAL SERVICES, OR TALK TO YOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR OR YOUR FRIEND'S PARENTS. WHAT YOUR FATHER IS DOING TO YOU IS NOT FAIR. YOUR MOTHER NEEDS TO GET OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE VIOLENCE ONLY GETS WORST OVER TIME, SHE CAN EVEN LOSE HER LIFE IF SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, PLEASE IF SHE DOESN'T WANT THE HELP (BECAUSE SHE IS SCARED OR TRAUMATIZED, YOU GET THE HELP). YOU ARE VERY BRAVE AND BRIGHT, YOU HAVE THE POWER TO BREAK THAT VIOLENCE FOREVER. YOU NEED TO GET PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP ALSO SO IN THE FUTURE THAT DOESN'T REPEAT WITH YOUR OWN FAMILY. YOUR FATHER WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR FATHER BUT HE NEEDS TO GET HELP FIRST AND WHO KNOWS...MAYBE IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN BE TOGETHER AGAIN AS A FAMILY BUT PLEASE GET HELP NOW, BEST OF LUCK FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!!!
KrkftOfkaa	So she is assuming she is unable to have children without any proof?  You found an "interesting" one, to put it politely.  Any reason why she thinks she's barren?  Medical issues, family history, etc?  Sounds like a temporary case of needlessly induced drama to me.  She may be addicted to having drama in her life if this type of stuff is why your last year has been that "rocky."  I'd asses if you think the rest of your life is going to be like this with this person and if you're willing to live with it or not.|`|AA12371168	does she have absolute proof that she can't have children?<br>  my ex was told he had a very low sperm count and couldn't have children and we had a daughter.<br>  would it be the end of the world if for some reason you didn't have a child?  nothing is guaranteed.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|dvYyRLNcaa	U Guys reaLlY need to talk about it maybe u can convince her have a serious talk
XomCHGrtaa	I am having the exact same problem. When I really thought about it, and what happened, I realized, why would I want to be this girl's friend if all she does is make me feel bad about myself? She called me some nasty names, and we got into a physical fight just last week. For me, all of the stress and pain she causes just isn't worth it. <br>  But, if you really want your friend back, tell your Mom or Dad what happened, and maybe they can help you work it out. Or, if you don't feel comfortable going to them, talk to your other friends. Explain what happened, and maybe they can help. Also, maybe you could try talking to your friends Mom,and just say I am really sorry about what happened, I really didn't mean for anyone to get hurt, but I was being hurt too, but in different ways other than just physical. Maybe she'll understand. It's worth a try.<br>  Anyway, I hope you can work it out. Good Luck!|`|n8nhjmfraa	shes not a good friend if she beat you with crutches so you're stupid if you still wanna hang out with her
lMKy9Ho8aa	give it time. TIME is the best healer. With each day, your pain will lessen. Just know that it wasn't meant to be. When the NEXT GIRL comes along, and she will, you will wonder why you worried over this one so much.<br>  Be patient.|`|AA11119636	new hobby, new things to do with yourself to make yourself better in every way, make new friends, date diff. girls...<br>  <br>  and DON'T date anyone you work with or even works in the same building...it's just too akwards when it ends|`|ed3eK4mHaa	It takes time to heal.  You either need to start actively pursuing other relationships, or start actively purusing another job. Its hard to get over someone you see every day.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Start by not seeing her everyday.... so get a new job. If you don't see her, you won't have to think about her as much. After that it will just take some time. <br>  Good luck!!
Lb15XHvBaa	Depends on if he was gay or not.  If he's straight, probably opening the door to see if he can make a move on you at work.|`|bdzG1VEDaa	It's obvious that he is flirting! Is he single? Fit? Do you like him? Then act on it! If he is older and married then just put it down to a compliment, lol|`|R2teBtllaa	probably just showin his appreciation for sexy high heels.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	he thinks you are sexy<br>  <br>  he is not gay like the person above me said, sexy heel boots are awesome. goes extremely well with skirts makes me want to do her right there!!|`|1EqwONoNaa	He probably likes you, and got real nervous when he said it, so just left. Lol|`|UhnetgNkaa	he likes you its nice to get a comment like that.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Have no idea what he was thinking, ask him.|`|vuRKaTawaa	i think he likes yooh !!!!!!!!!!|`|BO28Mn8haa	he watched the episode of "Drake and Josh" where they just complimented a girl, walked away, and the girl went after him. BTW it's HEEL.|`|TPZZESeeaa	don't read too much into this, take it for what it is, a compliment. he wanted to compliment you and did. very simple. whether he likes you or not is another question completely|`|0fVtHNtmaa	He's probably gay if he's noticing your shoes.|`|YVgIshUJaa	he might be not interested|`|v96pYAg1aa	He just likes ur style and u in it lol :3
hwRdT156aa	i didn't go to prom and i regret it big time now. even without a date i would still go because regardless of a date you will still have fun and remember this night for the rest of your life.|`|n8nhjmfraa	if your friends aren't going and you don't have a date then it seems pointless to go<br>  you probably wont have any fun and its a waste of money then<br>  who cares if your mom wants you to go because she won't have a bad time, you will<br>  but its entirely up to you but personally i would stay home|`|kHLwlNA5aa	You need to honestly answer this to yourself: In the years to come, when you look back and think about your school years. Which would be the more pleasant memory - you going to the prom without a date, or you not going to the prom at all. Only you can decide. Good luck whatever you decide.|`|WE91Bc8Aaa	If your other friends are going why not! Its a laugh and a party and you will prob have a good time. Plus there are prob loads of guys there that dont have dates... :-) have fun xx|`|nwuL7M7saa	You should definitely go to the prom, with or without a date. It will be a memorable experience.|`|JQrGknfMaa	Go... its a once in a life time deal. go enjoy yourself
8915b869fec119265c0310df0bc94db5aa	WOW....well all i can tell you is this ,well first of all i need to say i've been there and done that...so that being said..he will ALWAYS talk to his ex they have a daughter together ,and yes they will always have something to say about who he's with..good or bad.anyways,i really think you should just sit down w/him and just talk things out,instead of why are you doing this and doing that ,all that does is make them frustrated .you need answers soo just sit w/him and get those answers .and are you really ready for all this drama?lhope thins work out.|`|AA11119636	LOL @ came across some email...<br>  <br>  you invaded his privacy...trust seems to be an issue here<br>  <br>  you can have a talk about it with him and open up about your feelings....or try couple counseling|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Somethings up and it's always another woman.|`|a984cQjKaa	he's acting suspiciously.  go with your gut; something is going on.|`|AA11488745	He might want to have a relationship with you and someone else but do not want to tell you.  What reason do he have to leave in the middle of the night? Think about it.  There is something going on.   You said yourself that the signs are there.  The question is " what are you going to do about it".|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	I agree, I think you need to go with your gut on this one. His behavior is not acceptable.<br>  <br>  However, if you really do think there is potential, then I think you should try and talk to him about it. Instead of obsessing and driving him crazy, let him know you're serious and want to reach a solution, whatever it may be. Tell him everything you just wrote and how it's been affecting you; ask him why and what he plans on doing about it. Let him know you really care for him but that you won't stand that any longer. If he really and truly listens to you, then he's worth keeping, but if you try and talk with him and he's not being sincere, it's time to get out. If he's confused, let him know you gave him many chances. If you talk to him and he promises to change his ways then give him maybe a month or two and see how it works out; if he doesn't get any better then you probably need to find someone else. Good luck!|`|uhN7WmXhaa	Why don't you ask him about it,if your trust is kinda crashing down.What was or what is his problem that makes him kinda cold to you?Talk about it if you love each other,so that you could fix this matter.
pfm0wcEIaa	What you need to do is stop worrying about it.  I don't really know what this has to do with being Lesbian or not.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, you just want to look.  So what?<br>  <br>  I am not sure if I am understanding correctly, but it seems you had some sort of traumatic experience with another woman and that is why you are so worried about this????<br>  <br>  If this is bothering you a lot I suggest you seek some counseling.  Feelings of guilt or confusion can be very consuming.  And it seems you still haven't reached a full resolution as to why this happened to you.  Perhaps you think that it was you that provoked this 'traumatic experience'  somehow.  Maybe you are worried about looking at this girls breasts because you think you are bringing on bad things on to yourself.<br>  <br>  These are common thoughts for people to have if they have some sort of sexual traumatic experience.  You need to talk it through and understand what you did and did not have control over and why this all happened to you. <br>  <br>  These feeling are not going to go away on their own.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	I don't understand.  You stare at boobs but aren't a lesbian?  Are you jealous of other women's boobs?  Do you just like boobs?  What is the problem?  My boobs get stared at all the time, but I'm over it as they are natural and not going anywhere.|`|BL4PEjAWaa	look at a guy and you will see his chest too.  your eyes take in about 24 inches around the point that you are looking at.  Don't worry about it.  That's why they put blinders on horses.|`|BO28Mn8haa	yea you can tell when someone is looking at your boobies.|`|AA11119636	yes everyone stares at your boobs when they're talking to you!!!<br>  <br>  and you're a closet lez~ get ready for college...you'll definitely experience being a bi|`|2S2onP86aa	What? <br>  <br>  No they aren't staring at your chest. Just get yourself out of this confusion. It's nothing.|`|MKKx1luSaa	This isn't a big problem. You just think you're looking at their boobs it's all in your head. And if you are than the other person might not even notice. However, if you like lookin at boobs you might just appreciate the beauty of another women. It doesn't make you a lesbo but maybe bi or just curious. Don't worry about it not a big problem.|`|v96pYAg1aa	ok if someone is taller than u and is looking at ur face yes they will also be staring at ur boobs and yes its happened to me too one cuz me is tall as well and it sux being a guy and the girl thinks u looking down at her shirt :( ... but it even happens when u are at there level in height too so don't worry about it u are straight|`|VFdC2wPlaa	I have never had that problem lol. Instead of looking at them in the face... go for something more specific... like their eyes. Focus on what your saying and not so much where you are looking. If you always think "don't look at her in the boobs" then you are thinking about her boobs, which causes you to look there. If people aren't creeped out then i bet they don't notice... if they act all uncomfortable, then they probably do. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped... good luck with your unusual problem!|`|j9XYX8hLaa	Ok sometimes i do the same thing look at girl *** when they pass by and when there in my face look at there boobs and play like im looking they in the eyes its hard but sometime you can't help it.|`|BPqK0c5taa	I think your over thinking it to much. Your probably not a lesbian, but you could be bi-curious.|`|MHgTA9Buaa	i dont think you have a problem maybe you are just going through a breast phase right now|`|R2teBtllaa	they probably dont notice,,unless ur eyes are str8 gazing like its to jugs of milk.|`|nZgZWrGWaa	ur just thinking too much..besides, i look at boobs sometimes too , hahaha...theyre right there LOL.<br>  <br>  Dont worry.....|`|BeBEOFGxaa	well the first step is being aware of this.. you're proabably doing it subconciously.<br>  ahah im a girl and if other girls boobs are abnormally large or weird looking i accidentally look at them too. so dont worry about that.<br>  just notice what brings that on.. are you nervous? does she say something or do you feel something and it happens?<br>  <br>  if you notice that you are doing this already, make a point to yourself to stop, because people are gonna start thinking you're a little ... crazy.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|3L0OSuQYaa	AHAHAHA.<br>  My and one of my friends were talking about this a while ago and it just kinda happens. None of us get truly weirded out because sometimes you just don't want to look the person in the face.<br>  Just be sure you're most definetly not a lesbian first... :]|`|dfRHG35Aaa	Maybe you can see em in the corner of the eye coz of the top they are wearing.|`|Jhr68T0baa	you may just be going through a curious phase.  its ok to check out another girls rack.|`|jxeQWLpWaa	maybe you just like to look at boobs and compare them to your own!!! <br>  alot of girls do that...|`|wR3cwcXWaa	im confused?|`|GYobl7Xtaa	yeah just make ful eye contact or just look at something else around there|`|9EdBk9aBaa	pay them no mind, i mean i'm not a lesbian either but it's happend to me a couple of times, it's like even when you find yourself staring them str8 in the eye they're boobs are right there as well. but no they do not see you staring at them, and i mean i think it happens to alot of girls theyre just embaressed to ask anyone else about it. but i mean that's why i try not to even look at a girl when talking to them sometimes because it really makes me feel uncomfortable when i find theyre boobs in my eye sight. it feels like your staring intentionally but your not right? well best thing to do is bring up a major conversation where you dont have to stare at them and you get just look else where, it works for me.

Then after he speaks and tells you how he feels, ask him about the gift you gave him and how he felt about it. After the conversation is over show him the card and tell him how you feel about finding it in that condition.Thats all.|`|fqboOITjaa	I'll tell you what you should do, forget about him.

HnEcgVGiaa	Hi Court,<br>  <br>  Well! Engagement, huh? Seems like that guy doesn't know the different between engagement and a fling. He has to realize that engagement is a promise for the commitment - it's important as marriage. While you're both not have shared vows, there should be no way that he should have left you in the dark.<br>  <br>  Is he that embarrassed about being engaged to you that he refers you as an ex-gf? That would infuriate many girls. Some would have stormed into the restaurant themselves and pulled the guy out from his group!<br>  <br>  You need to realize that you need to be respected. He has simply shoved you into his pocket to be dealt with later. That's not how you treat your special someone! Two people who are engaged must have a strong connection between them, trusting them with their lives, and not be afraid to declare that they are together.<br>  <br>  Before he finishes his "thinking" time, you need to think quicker and make a decisive action. If that's a preview of your marriage, you've just received a red flag on this guy. Stop worrying about what you think he would want. Declare what you want! Anyone can say those three words "I love you", but did he mean it? He is genuinely in love with you?<br>  <br>  You must find what his real intentions are, even though you've pretty much seen his behavior this past Saturday. Decide if this guy is worth the wait, the forgiveness, and the effort to strengthen your relationship. Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with him? Raising a family? Sending your kids off to college? Can you build that strong family?<br>  <br>  Be thorough in your thinking, but don't dwell on them too long. Realize that you need to be respected, but don't be over-confident. Be honest and be clear about your decisions.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, you will have some kind of regrets. But you must learn to be strong and move on forward.<br>  <br>  If you do continue your relationship and he fixes his attitude, then everything's worked out. If you decide that you deserve better, then realize that you can love again! He's not the last guy you'll have feelings for.<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|oBnaku9zaa	Move on, sorry. It is not meant to be :(
qU2RbKWfaa	he is a kid yet
9A2lfMVHaa	There are 546,607 people with the surname Smith, in the UK so I would say about half could be male.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yournotme.com/testaspnet/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.yournotme.com/testaspnet/defa...</a>
ifgzHzA3aa	To me it sounds like she is worried about how the dress will look on her (since you said she had to be convinced to go try it on) and doesn't want extra people there.  I think the repeating the same cryptic text message to her brother was a little uncalled for, she could have just been honest about it.  I wouldn't dwell too much on it.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	sounds like trouble.  why did your fiance have to talk his sister into being in the wedding?  if she didn't want to do it, don't push her.  she'll just give you prollems down the road.  the fact she didn't want to participate and then didn't want you at her dress fitting is weird.  I don't think she likes you as much as you like her.|`|AA10784932	Maybe she is worried about the way she will look in the dress? Or if she doesn't like it, it would be easier for her to tell her brother than you, she wouldn't want to hurt your feelings. Do you two normally get along? To be on the safe side, I'd let her have her space, and see what kind of feedback you get from your beau and his sister, after she's tried the dress on.|`|AA11380378	What a wench. Sure, you are right to feel slighted and offended. She was condescending, sure she was, no way of hiding that.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I would have gotten the same weird vibe from this.  Call her - talk to her - find out what's going on.  It doesn't make sense.|`|cGbTJobeaa	This is much ado about nothing.  Think of your relationship with her in the big picture. You get along. She is excited about the wedding.  Leave it at that. Don't get your panties in a wad because she said "less is more."  You handle it by letting it go, forgetting about it completely, and saying nothing.<br>  <br>  She simply wants to go, get fitted and leave.  She doesn't want to make a grand production out of it with an entourage.  Having the shop keeper, your fiance, and you there now makes a production out of it.<br>  <br>  Whenever I was in the bridal salon prior to my wedding, there were frequently people trying on wedding dresses and bridesmaids dresses. The sample dress almost never fit properly so the dress either hung too loosely from people or (more typically) was only zipped halfway up the back and then the bra straps are hanging out, etc.  Most women are not their most attractive when trying on sample dresses.<br>  <br>  Lose the attitude and hurt. She likes you. She is excited about the wedding. That's what you need to focus on rather than one random comment.<br>  <br>  She just doesn't want to have a huge audience while trying on a dress that isn't going to fit her properly.  Her less is more commont probably has more to do with her brother being there than  you.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I don't know.. text messages can be so ambiguous and it's really hard to understand what people mean in them.  Maybe she meant that she didn't really want him to go along.. just you and her.  Or maybe she just didn't like the idea of having a couple of people watching her try on the dress. <br>  <br>  Don't take it personally.  I'm sure she's still excited to be in the wedding.  Next time you see her you could ask her what she meant by that.  A lot of texts just make no sense....|`|pNrfE7fHaa	Wow...that definately was rude.<br>  And its true, it doesn't sound like she really wants to be one of your bridesmaids.<br>  You may want to sit her down and ask her whats up.  Not to sound mean, but it doesn't seem like she likes you very much.  :(<br>  I'm in the same situation, my FSIL won't even talk to me.  I've tried.  So Idecided to not make her one of my bridesmaids and my wonderful groom agrees.  It is her fault she wants to be miss drama.|`|BeBEOFGxaa	maybe she was saying that she did just want it to be you and her??<br>  but yeah, i get the rudeness too. but inlaws are always trouble aha. don't worry about it. you have your husband and your gonna have a beautiful wedding. hopefully her attitude wont ruin it. shes being immatuare.|`|FnskUYpqaa	Perhaps she feel a little self consious about trying the dress on in front of you. If you wanted to go with them you should have just gone no need to ask it's your wedding, but now that you have I wouldn't worry about it.|`|wTevmGbmaa	I would have gotten the same vibe.  I would confront her about it, if you don't say something now, you'll be stuck with a ***** for a SIL for the rest of your life.. get it out of the way before your wedding day..  GL.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	That was very rude!  You need to talk to your FH because you have a lot of say so when it comes to the BM/MOH dresses!!!|`|66hMQmyyaa	No, your right and it was rude. Your fiance needed to say something and defend your honor. He better start practicing now, especially if this family situation doesn't change. Your about to become one, if he can't stand up to his sister now, you have a lot of future heartbreak in the future.<br>  <br>  Oh and also, if your FSIL doesn't support the marriage, DONT let her be a bridesmaid!! This is YOURS and HIS day....you need SUPPORT for the both of you. You two need to be surrounded by love, support and smiling faces....not the opposite!|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I would have a sit down with your FSIL.  From the sounds of it, it appears that she really doesn't want to be a bridesmaid and it is not law that she HAS to be.  Sounds like you may have asked her out of courtesy and respect for your fiance, but don't really consider her a close friend or someone that you want as your bridesmaid, and she feels the same in return.  <br>  <br>  sit down, talk openly with her and your fiance and don't pass blame or be mean about it.  I would actually just ask her if she wants to be in the wedding and that if she doesn't, you completely understand and respect that decision.  Give her an "out" because she definitely doesn't sound like she wants to be involved.
dX4Dll0yaa	Not that normal, but maybe he is just trying to be a part of your life (i.e. something to talk to you about). However, I should think that would have been a touchy subject.|`|6xQI445baa	This is bad behavior that borders on stalking. You need to tell him to<br>  stay away from you, be forceful, and don't let him have the idea that<br>  it is ok to treat you badly.|`|wv4rOWqZaa	not that normal, but he will get over it perhaps soon
cxNLOPHNaa	I don't see how biting down into a hard fruit can help a person improve their kissing skills. However, it might improve a person's health and breath thereby leading to more opportunites to practice one's kissing skills on a real partner.|`|dfa0f10d091f9f82c584408f50df66a8aa	Hmm...must be a new idea because I have never heard of that until now. I should ask my husband if he ate apples a lot when he was younger because he's an excellent kisser.<br>  My talent must have come from eating pizza I ate a lot of pizza during my dating years thats the a-typical party food and where I did most of my kissing LOL.<br>  I am sure that you could teach an apple a thing or two <3|`|H2Malt6Zaa	well u usually take big bites when u eat apples so it stretches ur lips out helping with more rangement in motion of the lips for kissing|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	I think Johnny needs to learn the music of McQuinn. It may help him focus. Maybe he needs to drink  a coffee. oh....tea.|`|BvMOASUJaa	Eating an apple won't help but sucking on an apple will. It will help you be a better kisser because you will be practicing kissing basically. Just think of the apple as someones jaw and mouth and there you go.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I guess it would help you kiss if you like the feeling of someone trying to eat your tonsils when you kiss.  <br>  <br>  After thinking about it, I can think of at least one person I've kissed in my life that may have practiced this way.  My mouth disappeared in to his and it was the worst experience ever.|`|n5r57gPHaa	Eating an apple will get u to be a better kisser because you have to flex your lips!! HAHA lol
xGshAiXOaa	My husband was in the Marine Corps when we got married, and we had roommates at first also.  Main thing to remember is that everyone knows that married people have sex, it's nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about.  Once you are married, apply for base housing to get your own place.  It is very common for military men and women to want to live off base, so your fiance's friend shouldn't have much trouble finding another roommate.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I think married couples always need their privacy. It would be best if you guy's didn't have any room mates, especially since you will be newly weds. I would discuss this with your fiance. And let him know that it's not something you want to do.|`|IvMPh09baa	lots of couples have roommates... i dont think its that big of a deal.  Just put some good stereo speakers in your bedroom so when your bumping uglies you can turn some music way way up and no worries about anyone hearing anything!|`|cGbTJobeaa	Are they getting a one bedroom or a two bedroom apartment? If it is a 2 bedroom, then why is this even a problem. Just keep your shrieks down to a minimum.<br>  <br>  Yeah...think having a marine in the next bedroom is uncomfortable.  Try being a newlywed and having one step child in the bedroom directly next to yours and another one in the bedroom directly below yours.  It is possible and as long as  you are discreet, the others will not know what you are doing behind closed doors.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	My boyfriend has two roommates, and it honestly hasn't been in a problem. We've been walked in on twice - each time we just laughed it off and continued. It's no big deal. Married couples have sex. Just be discrete and keep your moaning to a minimal.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	No I havent, nor would I chose to put myself in this type of scenario...you need privacy...especially if you are married.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	My fiance and I both have roommates. It's never stopped us. Put music on, wait until they're gone, go somewhere else...you'll figure it out.|`|qJ4W6fkUaa	I had a roommate when I got married and the three of us moved from an apartment to a larger house as soon as my wife and I got back from our honeymoon.  We lived together for two years until my wife and I had saved up enough to buy a house of our own.  It wasn't problem except for the last couple of months after HIS girlfriend moved in also.  Two couples under the same roof is NOT a good idea.  His room was across the hall so noise wasn't a problem.  Just get used to the idea that you will see his roommate (and he will see you) in various stages of undress from time to time so I hope you don't get embarrassed to easily.|`|29I8PWrxaa	My fiance is in the military as well.  We have our own house now off base, but when he used to live in the barracks, he had three roommates.  I wasn't allowed in the shacks, so on weekends we used to rent a PMQ that was available for visitors.  We were pretty broke most of the time, so sometimes we would rent it with friends who were also visiting for the weekend (there were three bedrooms).  <br>  <br>  Yes, it was awkward!  We all were trying to be as quiet as possible the entire time.  I am so glad we have our own place now with no roommates.  It's true, some married couples have roommates to help with the rent, but I personally would hate that.  But if it's the only way you can afford a place, then I guess you don't really have a choice ... :(|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I wouldn't recommend living with a roommate if you are getting married. That may cause problems and you need your privacy.|`|KR8OdLc4aa	just do it quietly<br>  <br>  ****  MEET ME IN MILDREDS PLAYPEN****|`|n5NDs9JAaa	Eh, my fiance said that when he gets our place in march, his friend is gonna stay for a bit as well (I won't move there till May when my semester is over with). But we both made it very clear that his other guy will be leaving once I get there. Neither of us want a roommate while we're married (as awesome as this guy is, no thanks!).<br>  I dunno about your relationship, but I love being naked and walking around and I've lived with my parents these past 19 years, i want my privacy finally! I want to cook topless and have sex anywhere I want to. My fiance and I want our own place where we can do what we please and call it our own.<br>  But do what you please, but think about EVERYTHING before you do it. Your roommate will have girls, listen to his music whenever he wants, will do gross things that you may not like... think about it.
AA10612425	it means he's flirting, give him a chance and see where it goes|`|1poSSvTdaa	Yes, because if it's before then it never would be. Be calm and try to fish. Often bread is sweeter WITHOUT honey. But who knows what lives in the dark caves?

Some girls like short skinny dudes and others like big dudes.  As girls get older and more experienced w/ dating they realize that relationships dont last because of the way the guy looks or how tall he is.  One night stands are based off appearance, a real long term relationship has to be more than that.      <br>  <br>  Just take care of yourself, eat right, dress nice and wouldn't hurt to workout once in awhile if you're that skinny.|`|xr8j9Tjhaa	depends on the girl. most females i know like guys who make them feel good about themselves. the physical is what we see first so it has some influence. but, we all have different things we find attractive. some females like slimmer guys while some like a meaty guy. <br>  <br>  be confident in who you are and what you have to offer a girlfriend. it sounds like you are a sweet guy who is willing to get to know people for what they are on the inside despite others who may judge them for what they look like. you deserve to have someone who appreciates you for who you are and what you believe in.|`|2JBLc5b7aa	nooo dont think that i am so attracted to personality before looks!!<br>  yes a guy might catch my attention if hes hot but i dont think any more of him if a guy with an excellent personality caught my attention i would be so way more interested in him.

It depends on the girl too, some girls are just to vain and will only go out with the "Cute" guy, and some really do not care.  I married a nerd :)|`|6iDjNKxHaa	Yes girls chose a boys for there hearts not there face.Boys are the opposite|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Depends on the type of girl. How superficial she really is. Some girls say they want a good guy but always end up with the "bad boy"<br>  <br>  Girls generally want a guy that is going to treat them good, with a good sense of humor and great personality, but yes there has to be some sort of physical attraction along with that. You don't have to be Tall, dark and have a 6 pack to be attractive. Different people find different things attractive in a person.<br>  Basically you just have to find a girl who is intelligent enough to know what she wants, and who is looking for real love, not superficial love.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|fc4NOCp3aa	I think it depends HUGELY on the person.  In general, yeah, people care about looks because they don't want to be embarrassed by someone.  People generally have a low self-esteem so who they date is a reflection of themselves really.  And for that reason, often teenagers go after the prettiest or the most handsome so that it makes THEM look good.  Believe me, there are those that continue that shallowness into adulthood but not most people.  <br>  <br>  I will say, that being more attracted to the prettiest or most handsome person is biological & natural.  Afterall, it's the first thing you see.  But it doesn't have to be everything....some people just make it everything.  Personally, I could never be with a guy who was just HOT and that was the only thing he had going for him.  I can't stand guys who have nothing to say, they can't carry on any intelligent conversation, aren't passionate about anything but their looks or don't care about their family.  As you get older, you'll find that VALUES will weigh more heavily for women than looks.  If a guy is handsome but isn't honest or is a total jerk to her friensd, she'll dump him!  Hang in there - you'll grow up - you'll get more handsome as you go b/c you'll learn some tricks  and you'll eventually find the right girl.|`|kbz5S3waaa	looks don't really matter much when you're old and wrinkly together, but the ability to love someone past looks, and to be able to converse with someone is forever (assuming dementia and Alzheimer's aren't an issue)<br>  <br>  But looks grab your immediate attention, it takes more to grab someone's attention with a personality|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Are you sure you are being objective?  I don't know anyone on this earth who would say they have a terrible personality.<br>  <br>  Since you talk about "girls", I'm going to assume you're young.  Young girls place way more emphasis on looks than mature women do.  When you all mature a bit (30+) looks won't be near as important than personality/personal traits.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I learned in one of my Psychology classes that people think they care more about personality than looks, but then when you look at how likely people are to want to go on a second date after they've had a blind date, the most determining factor is the person's look.  Most people just don't realize how much they are letting looks affect their judgment of somebody.  On the brighter side, the more you get to know somebody, the more personality becomes more important than looks.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think women want to feel an attraction physically at first.  After that it is definitely more about the person and how he interacts with others, and treats her.  None of us wants a gorgeous jerk that treats us badly.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Well attraction is usually there yes, but to me character in the long run means everything.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I do.<br>  <br>  My husband is nice looking but his personality is what attracted me to him the most when we first met.<br>  <br>  Edit...To loveit i NEVER cared about money and i still dont and when i met my husband he worked full-time but didn't make much so he didn't have much money at all and we still dont but i didn't and still dont care because money isn't everything..Health and happiness are more important things to me...He has worked at the same job for a little over 12 yrs.|`|MOMb0Amoaa	No honestly, i have fallen for bad looking guys after getting to know them.  By this i mean that guys who i considered bad looking at some point in time succeeded in changing my views about them after i got to know them because they got charming personalities<br>  <br>  Personality is what that matter.

That is why people dates those that they find attractive. We are judged first by our appearance since the rest is hidden by just looking.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Depends on the age and maturity level and the actual person. No two women are alike!|`|1HfLkTrdaa	It may be a cliche but it's true that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.  Just because one specific person might think you're not attractive, it doesn't mean that everyone else on earth will think like that, too.  If having one type of look was all that mattered, then the human race would've died out a long time ago.<br>  <br>  Fact is, looks fade.  Personality/popularity can only take you so far....same with money.... <br>  <br>  so for the long term, it's compatibility and shared values really are more important. Hence the reason for the Bible verse Proverbs 31:30-31.|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	There is someone for everyone.  One might think you are the most gorgeous guy she has ever seen rather it be on the inside or outside while another one can find you unattractive it happens to each and every one of us.  There can be a model whom is really pretty to most men however some guys can say she is unattractive to them.  Beauty does come with in.  I can see a gorgeous guy and he can say one little stupid thing and I can see all of his ugly flaws on the outside and I am no longer attracted to him.  I have seen guys who I probably wouldn't give a second look at if I was walking down the street but then their personality shines and I can see the beauty on the outside as well.  It is true believe me.|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	I think "girls" and "boys" are inclined to be shallow and go for looks.  That's the first thing you see from across a room.. not the personality.<br>  <br>  What you find, when you get older, is smart people realize that looks change, and fade...and what you're left with is what's inside.<br>  <br>  Gravity is not your friend when you get older.  You get wrinkles.  Things sag.  Hair falls out and grows back where you never wanted it.  Yet a kind and loving soul is so much more than that.  <br>  <br>  So, yes, I would say girls care more about looks...but women...real adult women...they look for what's on the inside.|`|lvelp0CGaa	In this day and age pretty much yeah its all garbage , girls are going for looks , money , cars , guys who can take them on holidays .....<br>  <br>  Its just the way it is , is your body going to stop you getting girls when your in your late 20's early 30's no it isnt because by then these little immature girls are going to be grown up and realise the nice guy really is the 1 they want and physically in the sensual side of the relationship guys who are skinny are usually the best lovers so just be patient and wait a few years .

89owZt6Haa	If these are all the facts, then it doesn't seem fair to deprive you and your grandparents time together.  Life is short, and we can lose our loved ones at any time.  On the other hand, if you saw them last year and your sister didn't have special solo time with them, then maybe this year should be her's.  It might be too much for the grandparents to have both of you at the same time.  Especially if you two bicker.|`|htcfyWblaa	You have to be spoiled, <br>  14 year olds aren't supposed to go on spring break! <br>  there are alot of people who can't go where they want because of the recession, Have you heard of it? <br>  People that work hard deserve vacations , you don't <br>  GROW UP! and p.s. : when they say nothing is fair, they really mean it|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	should have thought about his ahead of time, like your sister did.<br>  <br>  there are a lot of things you COULD HAVE DONE.  but instead of doing anything, now you want to sit and cry about it....  start saving some money now for next year.|`|sSTuay1Vaa	first of all, life is not fair. when you went last year did you go by yourself?  was your visit with your grandparents just you and them?  maybe it's your sister's turn to have a her and them visit?  I get the beach and Disney and all that jazz but to me it's not about being fair.  I'm a mom and I don't always make decisions on fairness.  Sometimes it just has to be the way it is for whatever the reason.  Sometimes one kid needs something different than one of the other kids.  Sit and think about it and try to put yourself in your parents shoes and all I can say is when you're a parent you'll get it.  Don't sit and sulk, enjoy your vacation too.|`|gsAurTdxaa	Well, for one, you could try babysitting, shoveling driveways, or even mowing lawns to make money. As for the being fair part, I would say that it could go either way. I think your parents are trying to teach you responsibility.

Could she be wanting some personal one on one time with your grandparents?  Could your grandparents have expressed misgivings about having both of you at the same time? <br>  <br>  There's a lot of reasons why siblings shouldn't always go on the same vacation.  If money isn't an issue, talk to your parents about you going later, maybe in the summer.  Right now, maybe there's something that is making your sister want time alone with them.  Would it be fair for her to have to have you along?<br>  <br>  Add:  I'd still try talking to your parents about you getting to go later on.

The only things men need to make us happy and stay with you forever are: respect, food, and sex. That's it. <br>  <br>  If you're doing something for your man, like fixing his hair, or suggesting something to eat, its all about how you do it. If you're fixing him because you're critiquing how he looks or embarrassed that he looks scruffy, he will resent you for it. If its because you just want him to look great, he will appreciate it.

fUBWB88laa	Yes the wedding band goes on your finger first and then the engagement ring. AND yes, you can get your ring sized before the wedding. If you go to a good place, it should only take them an hour or so with an in house jeweler. We took my wedding band in to be sized down after we bought it last month and they had it ready within two hours. You just need to try a few more places to get re-sized.|`|w1necKzYaa	the wedding band goes on first because it was believed that there was a vein going from that finger straight to the heart! <br>  Why is it so hard to take a ring off and put it back on? you can take it off before the ceremony then have your husband put both back on! or you can wear just the wedding band and put your engagement ring away!|`|94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	"she said its supposed to be that way because the wedding band is supposed to be closest to your heart... that makes sense but arent diamonds a girls best friend? shouldnt they be closer to your heart??"<br>  <br>  Seriously? You value the diamond more then the commitment of marriage?|`|SjnSeoq2aa	wedding ring first. sorry your wedding band does not have diamonds.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	tradition is the wedding ring is closest to your heart. since you don't have time to get your engagement ring re size you should have the jeweler put on whats called a ring guard which is a piece of metal that wraps around your ring underneath so that nothing can be seen and the guard will cost you no more then 5-10 bucks if that much. also it can be put on within minutes so you could wait while they put it on. also when it's your wedding day before you enter the chapel you will switch your engagement ring over to your right hand so that your left is free for your wedding ring. then when the ceremony is over that when you'll switch you engagement over to your left.<br>  <br>  about the diamonds are a girls best friend, yes you are right about that but there is nothing in the books about diamonds should be close to your heart.<br>  <br>  do whatever you want with your rings, wear it however you want. you are really thinking way too much into this.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	Traditionally the wedding band goes first, if you want to wear them the other way around then you can.  It always looks backwards to me though when I see it.  You have a couple options for when he puts the band on.  Most women don't wear the engagement ring on that finger for the ceremony.  You can put it on your right hand then switch it after the ceremony, give it to someone else to hold, or have your hubby put them both on you.  I would get a temporary ring sizer for at least the wedding day though, they have metal ones that slide on the back of the ring and make it smaller or some are clear rubber.  Most likely your photographer will take pictures of your hands together, then you are going to have all the pictures with backwards rings.|`|rHuAhN3iaa	On their wedding day, brides will often wear their engagement ring on their right hand so that their fiance can easily slip the wedding ring on their hand during the ceremony. After the ceremony you can put your engagement ring back on the proper finger.<br>  <br>  Although diamonds are a girls best friend, I think probably love your fiance more than your diamonds, haha.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	she's correct - you generally don't wear your engagement ring during your wedding ceremony (yes, the left hand is naked and it feels wierd) - thus the wedding ring goes closest to your heart.  After your ceremony have your engagement ring sized, and you want, have your two rings soldered together so they don't get separated/lost as easily.|`|RLiRS6lhaa	Ha! I agree on the diamonds being closer to your heart, but its not suppose to be that way. I'm not sure on the rest of your question cause i'm in the same boat, i need that answered too. But i've seen at some weddings that the brides don't have the engagement ring. They had put it on after the groom had slipped the band on.|`|o503YPrqaa	Ok wow lol That sounds stupid! I have my engagement ring (or will) first. Then the wedding band. Obviously when you get married he has to put the wedding band on.. so your already wearing the engagement ring. LOL So yes your right, its dumb. Just wear the engagement ring and then the wedding band. (My engagement ring is also too big)|`|HI0GitEYaa	you are right the diamond will already be on your finger when he he puts the band on.  When I put the band on my wife's had she changed it right away. I believe the band should be first the whole closer to the heart thing... it is a preference...|`|7WbehQZjaa	Hahaha, no. Traditionally the wedding ring is worn first because it is closer to your heart. But you can decide what you like. If it looks better the other way, go for it!|`|BXz2cyAzaa	the band goes first but if you want them to be the other way then you can have them the other way
Vv7a31pmaa	no.|`|0b5f07e5bab316afb60fcb47e579b84faa	I think it's cute =) he sounds like a good guy. If you want to kiss him, and you're comfortable with it, kiss him. He doesn't have to kiss you first.|`|Nq8fhhRPaa	It is refreshing to hear that you haven't had very much physical contact. It is not weird at all that you haven't kissed. My first kiss was on my wedding day when I was almost 19. I know most people can't wait that long, but it is great to hear that you aren't rushing into things. Take it slow it will happen when you are both ready. It will be all the more special because it wasn't rushed.|`|T5RHCYgNaa	How long have you guys been together? I had the same thing happen with my bf but then one night when he was walking me to his car he surprised me and kissed me. I think some guys are just slower then others so if you really like him then just let it happen. Its better that way anyways.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	Just give it time. Eventually you will both be comfortable with each other.  Don't rush a good thing :)|`|2I5XqMDzaa	just grab him and plant one on him!!|`|AA11353473	It's definitely not weird that you two haven't kissed yet.<br>  It's normal, and I'd suggest that you wait til the right time.<br>  So, that it wouldn't be as uncomfortable as right now.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq.YAP4TDTdtrBR4BSoAy_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152842AAjiLa3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XCqKLILMaa	it's not wierd. the time will come when both of you are ready [:<br>  maybe you can try to make him feel more comfortable my touching <br>  or kissing him first.|`|2c88J3M7aa	Awww ! It's not weird at all.. dont worry he's shy so just give it some time before you guys actually do (:<br>  Eventually when he's ready he'll just lean in and kiss youu !  =D|`|BE5HlQseaa	it is so totally not weird girl! it is completely fine! he is probably nervous. you just have to get him to open up to himself!<br>  good luck!<br>  hope this helps:)|`|uIZDd3y5aa	talk to him more about it and try telling him what you want to do, odds are he is feeling the exact same way|`|3c443ee00e72ff56c472359a9f0c1abbaa	No, that's not weird. The time will come. It'll happen when it feels right :)|`|ECaqY67Iaa	no way! it means your relationship is built of friendship! =) nice one!|`|hPRPO3qgaa	how long have you guys been going out?|`|G7ngqtQdaa	It's perfectly normal<br>  <br>  <br>  relationships are different, so don't think there is something wrong with yours, depending on what other people are doing.<br>  <br>  He sounds shy, and if this is his first relationship, he will probably be a little prude.<br>  <br>  You might be afraid of how he'll react, but the next time you say goodbye, before turning away give him a hug. <br>  <br>  then later, tell him he's a good hugger, or that you like hugging. This will want to make him hug you more. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about him not liking it. He's a 15 year old boy. Him and his hormones will love it and probably be looking for more :)<br>  <br>  <br>  If it gets awkward, remind yourself that you want this to work.Be decently casual when it comes to talking about hugs (or kisses). Not all the time, but if it comes up be flirty, and tell him how much you liked it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Chances are, he isn't hugging(or kissing) you in the first place because he's afraid of your reaction. He's probably wondering just like you, if your relationship should take it up another notch. <br>  <br>  Let him know you want to, and don't be afraid to make the first move.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luckkk <3|`|Vksq0AVxaa	Theres nothing wrong with that at all! I'm just a year older than you, and my boyfriend is a year older than me, and it took us juuust about 2 months to kiss. [Pretty much first relationship for both] We were both shy. Trust me, the first time will happen when it's suppose to. Don't rush it, don't force it. When it happens, it'll be totally special. Don't just force it because you want it to happen, that'll take the meaning out of it. After your first time, your kisses will get better and better and better, and more often. Just give it time, you'll be fine!|`|AA10126871	Don't do anything that doesn't come natural.  If you want to kiss him one day, ask him if you can, and I'm sure he will say yes.  If he doesn't, then tell him why, and if he says he isn't ready, then I guess you will have to wait longer - which is okay, you guys are both still young.<br>  <br>  Hug after your next date, or when you see him next time at school or something.  Maybe you should make the first move, to get him looser and more interested in kissing or hugging and not nervous anymore.|`|QAvuORejaa	everyone grows at a different rate. Personally I've been going out with my boyfriend since summer of last year and we haven't kissed until recently. It took a while and I was uncomfortable with it. It's not weird, maybe it's instincts waiting for the right moment. It is your first kiss right? It should be something that happens when you're ready, and is easily memorable|`|DkScpJN8aa	You should kiss, since its both of urs first relationship just talk to him, ask him if hed like to kiss you and that you'd like to, then just lean in and learn together xxx|`|FZ2qdorRaa	Hmm well it kinda depends on how long you have bin going out fer..but Dont do it if your unfortable! but if u really want to its easy at night i find so its kinda dark out <br>  <br>   Hope I Helped a lil good luck Byes <33|`|KEXZtZeRaa	you're both young and shy, give it time, don't rush anything you don't feel comfortable with|`|rhTCejrtaa	it really depends on how long you've been together,<br>  but it'll be natural when it comes :)|`|EdDCDii4aa	not weird at all! you'll both know when you're ready to go to the next level. good job for not pushing the limits!|`|HcWJwx0Baa	You get comfortable with him <br>  <br>  Yes|`|8NvIh3Rtaa	will i gess he just not right guy for u or u wil have ot soon|`|fgXnEx2oaa	hun give it time it will come when the time is right you will know|`|3nyoCTBxaa	No it's not weird at all!

zdu3gh8jaa	Have you ever tried to 'teach' your husband how to be a dad? Sounds daft I know, but have you? Some people just don't understand what being a parent involves. Sometimes they feel it is their duty to control the child, some fear that if they don't be strict when the child is young and impressionable, then they will become law breaking wild cats when they get older.Stop fighting and keep talking to your husband. Find out what it means to him to be a father. Look at the relationship he had with his father and see how that relates to him and your son. You don't say how old your son is  and yes his safety is paramount there are no two ways about that, have you talked with your son about how he feels with the situation? Have the three of you sat down and calmly discussed house rules so to speak therefore everyone knows what is expected of them and the consequence of not maintaining them? Behaviours of both adults and children can be included in house rules but the idea is everyone in the household gets the chance to say what they want to say without interruptions or angry words from others. Also it gives everyone the opportunity to be involved in making the family environment a peaceful place to be.<br>  Another one is to let your husband know when you feel he has handled situations with your son well and when he has displayed the sort of father/son  behaviours that you are looking for, encourage it. As I previously said parenthood does not come naturally to some, hence the reason why they need to be taught. For example: say you went for a family day out doing boys stuff, eg fishing, and your son asked your husband to show him how to bait the line. Your husband does this without shouting or criticising your son in any way, well when you get your husband alone for a moment, tell him how good he was at explaining that. Praise works much better than accusations. <br>  You could as others have said, go for family counselling although  I don't think your husband would go for that at the moment, but again it is worth asking him.<br>  I would keep talking, keep encouraging and only if things get really bad, ie your son is suffering in some way or your husband becomes physical or he is controlling in other areas of your marriage, would I consider divorce.<br>  I hope that this has been of some help and I hope the future brings your family lots and lots of happiness. Good luck and keep smiling.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Divorce him. He can't get over his resentment of your son. Or insist that you both see a family counsellor and get help that way.|`|ynFtyVKYaa	Have a talk with him and your son.Because chances are if your feeling this way your son is feeling worse. Sit down with your husband have a talk with him about what you see is happening then get your husband and son together all 3 of you sit down and talk..Disvorce should be your last resource if things get that bad then you should consider it because when a man accepts a woman as his wife he should accept her child like if that was his own child cherish love and care for both of you|`|Iqco1PcQaa	tell him to ease off, he is making things worse, he would do better by complementing the son and helping him, this would take the pressure off the family as a whole. show all the answers to hubby|`|AA11706291	Divorce him. Men aren't worth the waste of time and energy.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Divorce him if it comes to it. You are right to put your son first|`|uYjUZrcYaa	You need to talk to your husband about how his treatment of your son makes you feel and that he needs to lighten up or you will have to do something about it. Think about it and think what you want to do if you want to speak to a councillor, take a break for a while or anything else you may want to do, but you need to think about how your son is feeling and what you can do to fix what is going on and make sure it is your own decision! Hope this helps :)|`|MUDDyIKtaa	While I certainly feel for your situation cause i have been there, I have two sons with my ex who is hardly ever around, and then two sons with my husband now, There was quite a long period of time that i felt the same way, "OH you are being to hard on him" Well I am so sick of hearing people say LETS GET DIVORCED! Are you kidding. Work it out, go to counseling,(include your son) It took some time but it made such a difference in more ways than one. I truly understand your son should be number one, but I didnt always realize that my husband just really wanted the best for our son. Our marriage is great and the the boys all turned out great. PLEASE don't use the divorce thing as a solution, thats an easy out, work together and communicate otherwise you will regret it!!!  Things may change slowly, but they CAN CHANGE in time.|`|nN2pIykfaa	when i got married my husband adopted my son and at the beginning treated him really well but as my son got older he started to get too strict with him. he wanted to control everything my son did, at all times, and this caused tension between us for a long time. eventually i found out that he was physically violent towards him and i left him to ensure that my son was safe. i'm not saying this will happen to you, but i felt i had to reply to your question and beg you to watch very closely as I will always feel guilty that i didnt know what was happening in my home to  my son. please please make sure your son knows you are on his side and you will always put him first. don't just assume your son will know this. if your husband doesnt pay any attention to you when you talk to him about this issue ask yourself does this mean he doesnt care if he's being a bad father, and doesnt want to learn how to be a good one. your son is the most important person in all of this.|`|1QNRt09Faa	Go with your heart. Try to get counseling. If your husband truly loves you and cares about your feelings, he would work on his problem with your son. Trust is very important in a relationship, do you want to lose your sons trust in you? <br>  There is some sites on this webpage you might be interested in, go check it out. It might be a step in the right direction. Get with people that might be able to help you. Believe that things can get better, Have faith. Be there for your son too. Be around positive people. What is it that really might be putting your husband on edge? Try and talk to him and ask him. Im not telling you to get a divorce, but sometimes spiritual guidance can really make a difference.<br>  Have a good day :-) <a href="http://www.moviesandgifts4u.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.moviesandgifts4u.com</a>|`|W0633l18aa	if he isnt going to respect your wishes and wont listen to you its time for a divorce<br>  <br>  or by simply telling him you are getting one may shock him into behaving like a man.

Our parent didn't agree but we did see each other and we're also strict when it comes to religion. Sex will get involved once you both get really deep into each other and he knows it too. Age ain't nothing but a number and love ain't nothing but a thang. If you really want to be on the safe side just wait until you turn 18. the only thing is that he's not garunteed to wait on you but if it's really meant to be it will be and if not it's because God has someone else better for you in his plans.|`|BvMOASUJaa	Yes you can, but you have to be careful.

1poSSvTdaa	He has other things on his mind. Part of him wants a girlfriend to wait for him, and part of him knows that will be difficult. So try to be understanding and caring, and see what the future brings. Then he will know that you are a true friend and that you would be a great girlfriend. If you hassle him, he will think the opposite.|`|Un9CElCaaa	he is doing this because he likes u and and u like him and he is trying to make it easier on u when he has to leave. he is trying to make it so u dont care that he is gone|`|TPZZESeeaa	actions speak louder than words, please remember that
TPZZESeeaa	most of the underage girls i know choose option c, they go for what they want when they want it. i wish they would wait till they were old enough instead of having to hurt their feelings|`|hXFndli2aa	probably keep an eye out for him until im 18 and thats if i knew that he'd be interested in me too|`|EHVGbev6aa	It really depends. I would talk to them and get to know them and make sure they didn't want that one thing. Most couples are from 5-10 years apart and they work out really good. I don't think there is anything wrong with it. There is this girl who is 17 and talking to a 22 year old and there is nothing wrong with that until other things start happening and then that's when it needs to be ended.|`|f4gRedsqaa	it really depends HOW much you like him.<br>  what do you think would happen if you did get together with him?<br>  are you ready for a wayyyy more mature relationship if you got together with him?<br>  <br>  i think that if that happened to me i would at least wait til i was out of highschool. because then you can relate easier to him.|`|qShNwVenaa	forget about it|`|vHcoVeS4aa	i would forget about it and move on.|`|Puu5OMucaa	if i liked the guy enough i would wait.<br>  it really depends on if your both truly committed.<br>  it would suck if you waited for her but in return she went around with other guys, and wasnt totally serious about you.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|bcd2f8a4de30c0766a3301b22926e0f8aa	Maybe stay friends and see what progressed when I was legal.|`|qU2RbKWfaa	who has time for that ?

ijLewIjnaa	Sounds awesome! Your party sounds just about set.  See if you can bring in the theme more to your party room-your blue and green theme.  You want to emphasize your theme so all your party-goers will remember your party! Don't stress out too much and I suggest that on your party day/night, you two get ready extremely EARLY to avoid all lateness and rushing as possible.  I know this came to be a huge problem with my friends because there were issues such as hair not coming out right, dress not fitting right, limo not coming on time, etc.  Otherwise, I hope you two have an awesome night! Lis|`|safyawstaa	I think that what you have planned so far is really cool. I'm 13 and I just went to my friend's 13th birthday party, and she had us go to her party in a limo. You should try the best you can to make your entrance and arrival at the party amazing and memorable! I hope it turns out great for you! =] Also, maybe so you can stand out more..you should make everyone else wear black and white or a set color.|`|Qi9qrikhaa	im- well actually i'm pakistani but my dad even though he's muslim grew up in india and ur party sounds awesome!!

Z0lbrnHpaa	you just have to learn how to balance what's really important from what's not necessary to say. If it's something that is affecting you negatively, then speak up. Don't give your opinion just to give it...especially if it's something rude/hurtful.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	I think that would depend on what it is. Some things are just rude to say.|`|BXz2cyAzaa	speak out|`|f52e5967d0543cca0ae7f2e43b08fc91aa	well, unless it would really benifit them to know don't tell them.<br>  my bestfriend told me today something he really could have kept to himself, so i think if you just keep things that don't matter to yourself you'd be a better friend.<br>  unless they ask, don't tell them.<br>  <br>  <br>  but do remember, you shouldn't keep it to yourself it's really going to bother you. in that case you should do what you think is more important.|`|PhPwAGVNaa	Hm, here's another question: <br>  Is it better to be comforted by lies or to be disappointed by the truth?<br>  <br>  Answers for this question varies from person to person, and you need to understand that.<br>  <br>  Personally, for me, I speak out, no matter what.  I'd rather be disappointed by the truth.  What about you?<br>  <br>  When does ignoring problems ever help? Hm .. NEVER?!  I think what you're doing is the right thing, no matter how hard it may be.  Keep doing what you are doing.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, think about how you've been telling your friends about your opinions.  Is the way you've been telling them the same way as the way you'd like to be told?<br>  <br>  You say that when you have "a problem" with your friends, you will tell them straight up.  Obviously, anybody will be upset if anybody has a problem with them.  The mature thing to do is address and acknowledge the problem and try to fix it.  Next time ask if they'd rather you be immature about it and go around talking behind their backs instead?  <br>  <br>  The gist: SPEAK YOUR MIND (=|`|kPUWgFQmaa	You shouldn't have to be silent to please people. Speak out and just be yourself. That's the healthy way. if they don't like you for who you are, they're not your real friends.|`|B1fsP4ahaa	I'm a very blunt person and speak my mind. I always tell it like it is because your true friends will say by your side, your fake friends can't take the truth.
HB3fDXeMaa	"We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl" <br>  - I can't remember the name of the song its from but I remember the lyrics....I just think it's a sweet/funny metaphor.<br>  <br>  "If You Leave Me I'm Coming With You" <br>  - The title of a play my parents went to go see.<br>  <br>  "More than words is all you have to say to make it real...then you wouldn't have to say that you love me cuz I'd already know" <br>  -Can't remember the band but the song is called "More Than Words" and its one of my favorite songs.
6tW2DFYSaa	Yes especially when it comes to relationship or family problems.|`|fLMc72q4aa	Yes,  wish I didn't tho
404dbf27fa7877e868281fc2f6fdff39aa	Well, I'm glad your dad will be OK.<br>  Glad you recognize that!<br>  Maybe you are still in shock over what could have happened.  A typical anxious response.  I hear that!<br>  So, here's the thing, tell him how happy you are that he's going to be OK.  Tell him how scary it is (if you are indeed scared) that he could have been hurt worse.<br>  Ask him if there's anything that people (he) can do to be extra careful.<br>  And then, you will feel that your whole family is more prepared and better protected against future injury and possible loss.<br>  A question for you-<br>  do you keep getting extra attention for crying? It wouldn't at all be your fault if you are learning to cry because it naturally gets you attention. That would be understandable.<br>  If you think you are prone to crying on a regualr basis, then you probably woudln't think situation was any different and probably wouldn't even ask. <br>  But if you find you cry easily at other times, talk to your parents and your doctor about that.<br>  Could be hormonal, could be attention, etc.<br>  If this is the only recent occurence, then you're probably just a little shaken and a good talk will help you move forward.<br>  Just keep yourself busy, and on track with school,etc.<br>  There should plenty of extra things to be done while he heals, eh?|`|Wz1O9m53aa	everyone gets upset when something bad happens to a loved one your thinking about what could have happened instead of what happened.|`|l9rGfAqvaa	That is so normal. Keep on crying and let it out. It will make you feel better.<br>  God Bless you!|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Its only shock.  Over the summer my dad got tongue cancer, we dont know why- Nobody on his side smokes, not him, it runs in his family- anyway, I was freaking out he was gonna be fine, not for a few months, but I was still nervous.   But its just shock and worries.|`|wBnLB369aa	you have feelings for your dad.<br>  well it's natural you will keep thinking about him because you love him.<br>  after a while you will stop crying but deep down inside you will always be sad since this happened. well if you want to stop crying then make a challenge every time you shoot a paper ball into the trash bin he well be safe the more baskets you make the more safer he is. after a while you will forget all about this.

9UQlhzitaa	yea you need to sit your present gf down and tell her you feel like your being called a cheater without any reason for it.Also let her know that was a past flame now gone out unless you want to push me her way. Other than that she is just a friend without a penis.Then you ask her what have you done to make her believe that she is not the one you want.Then tell her you do like that she is so attentive to you but you still need other friends as well besides her.<br>  <br>  That ought to about do it, if she still insist that you stay away from her then you have a very insecure lady on your hands<br>  <br>  you also try making a deal that you will not be alone with her so that ought to set he mind at ease|`|K119R72Caa	Tell your friend what your girlfriend is saying,and tell your girlfriend how you feel about her and say that the other girl is only a friend now.

c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	This does not sound good! A friend of mine took Aderol in high school and it really messed her up. She could stay awake but she acted crazy and the schoolwork it helped her stay awake for was sloppy and didn't make sense. Needless to say, it didn't help her grades. Anyway, you can get addicted and it's dangerous. I would be very concerned about her heart as well as her mental stability. I'm not sure if you can convince her not to take it though. People with no support systems tend to do whatever they want. You should talk to her though, it's worth trying.|`|ivejg4whaa	Adderal will speed up your heart rate for sure. Drinking on them can be dangerous if not life threatening. <br>  And yes, Adderal can be addictive.<br>  Just talk to her, tell her that you are concerned and warn her of the risks.
a984cQjKaa	if you're having doubts that have nothing to do with the way your family would feel about you living with your boyfriend before you're married, then perhaps it is still too soon for you to be moving in with your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  then again, you practically live there anyway.|`|ijR3ygAJaa	Why don't you start out with what you are doing now, only in his new house?

Discuss with your boyfriend your feelings on this issue and that you love him and would someday make a life with him. But right now in this stage of your life, this is not what you want viz moving in with him and living like husband and wife. Right now you're just comfortable with the way the arrangements are. He should respect your decision on this and this life changing decision should be a mutual one and not one sided for a successful relationship.

But when we talk at night when he gets off work, is the only thing that helps best. <br>  <br>  I like to try to improve my weight or hair or whatever while he is gone so I look good when he gets back(he would be happy if I was 200lbs but I can diet better when he is gone:)I'm only 130 now but quite toned and pregnant to boot), also I have a bad habit of rearranging the house and doing painting or whatever while he is gone, it keeps me busy and doing yardwork is good so the kids can play outside too.

ik9hP6FBaa	well i remember when i was like this, to make you feel happy i surrounded myself with people that trust me and that love me for who i am. if you dont have NO ONE, i say try making new friends and try to expose your personality to others and people would love to be your friend. ( i bet you have a great personality!) Also, i think that you should talk to someone about your feelings, its a good way to let your emotions out then just keep them in, the last thing you want is to fall apart. talk to a therapist or anyone! someone that will never ever judge you!

nkpRxWLgaa	You've had a lot of loss in your life.  I know that it is so hard to accept when loved ones die.  It seems so crazy that the world continues to turn when your life feels like it's come to a screeching halt.  All I can tell you, honey, is that you have the strength to get through this terrible time and eventually the world will begin to turn on it's axis again.  You have a loving heart and your friends were blessed to have you in their too short lives.  You have no reason to feel guilty.  Lakin was too immersed in the darkness she was feeling to be able to share with you.  You were her best friend and she didn't want you to hurt as she was.  She knew you would, because she knew you loved her.  I, too have had losses and I've always believed that if a person could be present at their own funeral before it actually happened, to see the sorrow that is left with those who love them, they'd never make that choice.  Your beautiful tributes brought tears to my eyes.  Thank you for sharing them.  I don't know if it helps, but I pray for peace and solace for you and all their loved ones.  You can never "get over" a loss, but you can find comfort in loved ones and it will become something that your soul can bear, and the memories will become a solace in themselves.  I think you've already learned that.  Don't feel you have to get over it, just let your tears heal you.|`|AA12198711	Yes, death is hard at times and sometimes impossible to accept.<br>  <br>  "Dear God, I'm Only 17<br>  Author Unknown<br>  <br>  The day I died was an ordinary school day.<br>  How I wish I had taken the bus,<br>  But I was too cool for the bus.<br>  <br>  I remember how I wheedled the car out of Mom.<br>  "Special favor, " I pleaded.

Find some pictures online or in a magazine that you like and take them to your florist. Sometimes combinations you didn't think would go together compliment each other well. <br>  <br>  Or, if you have a favorite flower like tulips, ask your florist to use that as the main flower and they can find other plants that go with it. <br>  <br>  The sky is the limit. Be creative and you'll find something that works for you.|`|aipChC3haa	I'm doing 4 different types of flowers, it's kind expensive, but SO worth it =)<br>  But, I think that you should put them together and take a picture of it.

Is it because you're afraid they'll laugh at what you have to say?  Because you don't think you can contribute to the conversation?<br>  Then, think of it realistically.  Are any of these things true? probably not.  You have just as much to add to a conversation as anyone else, so don't sell yourself short.

Aside from the obvious, think of the reason's you are so comfortable around your friends that allows you to be able to express yourself.  Once you know this, apply it to people your not close with.  The key is to find something you have in common with other people.  Then talk about it.  If you know something about the conversation that is going on, jump in, tell them about your experience with the topic of conversation.  Just remember, they are only people.  Chances are if our talking to them they likely have something in common with you.|`|PUumsOqBaa	I have that same problem but the way ive come to deal with it is...<br>  <br>  When im in a situation were maybe i have to sit next to a girl/boy i dont know in class, ill ask him/her if i can borrow something like a pen or pencil, and maybe ask hi/her about last weeks homwork try starting a convo about the things you like and she/he might like the same things and you will become more confident knowing you can speak to people you dont know with out any problems. <br>  <br>  Hope This Helped :)|`|hIrdaRdWaa	I am the same way i dont see anything wrong with it.

That way she can help him understand you and you shouldn't have to fear him cheating with her.<br>  Honestly,<br>  relax a little. Lesbians aren't a threat.|`|Nxt0jzACaa	If she really is.

qsG5T9x5aa	in my opinion i think you should talk to him about it, ask him what your asking us but dont makee it that akward.
QtTvjLS4aa	It actually is, i mean deep down we know that we like you but at the spur of the moment we just freeze up because we don't expect a question like that to come up and that's the best thing to say because it doesn't cause any problems and it doesn't hurt anyone feelings. In fact we actually have like a planned way of letting you know that we like you and we don't want you to know it like that. We guys are shy and when things like that happen it's like a defence mechanism and we find it easy just to say that as it basically puts that akward situation to ease. If you really want to know what he feels about you ask him when he is alone, he probably was too shy to say yes or no with his friend around and if you ask him when he's alone he will definitely give you a real honest answer. Hope i helped.|`|4d62502510861ac4f6499590d0d9f5d5aa	Very. I always reply no to the question even if i do like the girl.<br>  <br>  Us guys are shallow. We don't have girls as best friends unless we are attracted to them.|`|ThKKB4dGaa	Yes.<br>  Because probably your around and that would be really wierd if he told you and his friend was there.<br>  Plus I have the same dilmea in my life too.(:|`|qJCgI0Paaa	It may depend on who's asking him. Maybe he felt that that person has no business knowing how he feels about someone, or he doesn't trust him with a serious answer.|`|90e83d1f5f2195277c80d4dc0c8ef428aa	You should ask him when you are alone if he feels that the relationship could ever be more than friendship. If you are mature enough to remain friends with him, even if he says no, then it will be out in the open and your mind will be at ease.
50c48696b7488dc525798f3a4b51347daa	The best sign of cheating is how your husband treats you.  <br>  <br>  Emotional affairs can be very damaging.  Affairs are unfair.  The spouse that is having the affair talks to the other person about all the problems in the marriage.  That person affirms that the affair spouse is all right and the spouse is all wrong.  What you feel as the spouse being cheated on is all the pain and all the blame while your spouse is much too comfortable.  It will seem like nothing you do is right no matter how hard you try.<br>  This is the best way to explain the damage that emotional affairs do in a marriage.  Imagine a seesaw that is level.  Now image one person climbing on one end and two on the other.  The person on one end gets left dangling helplessly while the two on the other end have total control.<br>  In order for your marriage to work out your spouse will need to end the affair.  If your spouse does not then your marriage is doomed and you will be left crushed on the ground while the other two waltz off the seesaw.<br>  If you suspect cheating, it is okay to look into your husband's private affairs such as his email and his cell phone to check for messages from an unknown woman.  Once trust is violated then privacy goes out the window and he no longer has a right to it until he can earn your trust back.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	1. Always give your husband the benefit of the doubt<br>  2. Ask yourself the following questions:<br>  - Does your husband know you really, truly love him?<br>  - Does your love show itself through physical affection and sex (a man doesn't REALLY feel loved at a deep level without affection and sex.   We are very different than most women in this sense)<br>  3. Have you made an effort to keep your sex life good/great by:<br>  - Making it a priority in terms of frequency<br>  - Making as much effort to "please" him in bed as you did when you were "dating"<br>  - Taking care of your body, remember the body he fell in love with?  That is the one that drives him crazy.  Do you still sort of look like that?|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	don't jump to conclusions. If it happens repeatedly then he needs to talk. One time, could have been a wrong number. Friends are not Friends when it comes to marriage. They love to make you worry. I never listen to what my friends say. If I would have my marriage would not have lasted for 34 years now. I trust my husband, he comes home to me, and always has.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Dont let gossip ruin your relationship. If he hasnt admitted to anything, and you havent caught him, dont worry about it.<br>  <br>  The call could have been a wrong number, or some psycho chick who got your number somehow and is trying to break up your relationship and move on in the back door.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	it could be totally random believe it or not. <br>  i once had a woman calling my cell phone asking for a guy i didn't know.  she was convinced i knew him, and i didn't.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Random hate.<br>  Trust your man unless he gives you a good, solid, tangible reason not to.|`|AF2d1fXBaa	Maybe it's nothing to do with him and she just thinks you're a b**ch.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Did they call your land line or your cell phone? I recently changed my cell phone number and almost immediately started getting daily texts from some random number, saying "B**ch". I asked my husband if he recognized the number and he said no - it was also easy enough to check our cell phone bills and see that number was nowhere on my husband's bills or mine before I changed my number.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Could it have been a wrong number? Probably not. If I were you I would let it go. If he's cheating I guarantee you will eventually get hard evidence of it. You will have to make a decision to trust him again and decide whether or not you should stay. Consider the call a heads up but don't say anything until you actually have proof. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1JsWMX0daa	DO NOT ACCUSE A MAN IF U DO NOT HAVE PROOF!!! If He IS doing it, sooner or later he will get caught cause the longer people get away with somethinbg th4e mor4e carelesss they usually get untill caught. Once you make an accusation U CANNOT TAKE IT BACK! It can easily ruin you relationship over nothing possinbly.|`|fznvQptlaa	sounds a little bit fishy to me but not knowing u or ur situation it could be random. good luck. id follow ur gut to a point. a wife knows if her husband is cheating on her or has. i think its kind of a sixth sense we have...|`|oSvwWFEIaa	well random people usually don't call you up and call you name 4 know reason. I'd lie to your husband and say she called me today and told me everything how could you just mess with him and see what he has to say!|`|09k5GLLkaa	Do you have any reason not to believe your husband? I think you need to either trust your husband or get rid of him. A marriage without trust is not a marriage at all.|`|19fa39a2ed4e38229aee162e273509bcaa	ummm prank call ???|`|AA11833436	That is possible.   Why didn't you *69 her and ask her what her problem was?|`|af2bb29a607e269fd8497ceea873f78faa	Did your friends see him cheating on you? How do you even know that who ever called you is because of him, maybe you did something to someone, some where? If your husband denies it, and you can see no signs, believe him. If I have to bet, it is the friend who told you that he is cheating on you who called you an b**tch|`|404dbf27fa7877e868281fc2f6fdff39aa	I think if your friends are telling you something, you ahve to wonder why.<br>  Are they jealous, or id this for real?<br>  Because if there are problems, seriosu ones, in your marriage, then you might have guessed earlier.<br>  They say, "A woman always knows."<br>  Trust me, I'm a naturally suspicious cop's daughter, untrusting, etc., but the one time when it was happening, I knew months ahead of the break-up, and closed my legs early on.<br>  So, you probably know, unless you're denying your gut.<br>  Good luck.<br>  And this woman?<br>  Who knows? MAybe it's true. Maybe she's jealous.<br>  Maybe she is a bit unbalanced.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Sounds like it to me.  Ask him straight out?  If he doesn't want to answer, you have your answer.  If he denies it, go with your gut.  Watch how he talks to you... does he look away... does he look nervous... does his eye flutter?  <br>  <br>  I think if he denies it and you think he is being honest, I would start watching his actions and whereabouts and excuses in the future.|`|V9wxH13naa	Id trust him, unless you have no reason not to. This happened to my mom, she got calls at 1 in the morning saying they were with her man, boyfriend, and it happened a few times, but turns out he WAS cheating soo....if you don't trust him, do some investigation.|`|B6ioLtejaa	Personal experience talking here.  He has BIG TIME cheated on you! Wake up and smell the roses lady! You should do something about this now before you find a rabbit boiling on your stove. My god woman, don't be so naive. If you need a shoulder cry on let me know.|`|SQQca8G5aa	You already asked this question, go away and deal with it.|`|TMm4pebPaa	Trust your instincts! If you think he's cheating, then do some investigating. You have a right to know!!|`|ABD9wkIuaa	could very well be if she is calling you be careful this is how stalkers come to be alot
aDL7xmt6aa	You married your mom???<br>  So is he your brother or your uncle?<br>  Or a Bruncle? Or a Broncle?|`|7e8NN8saaa	You know what - he's your son - not hers. And she isn't likely to change. Life is too short to spend time explaining things to someone who isn't going to figure it out no matter what you say. Maybe you should take a page from your son's book and not talk to her or spend time with her either. I know she is your Mom - but she sounds toxic - especially since your brothers kids are having the same problem. Toxic people can make you sick - really.  You are not a bad daughter - you are a good mother.|`|koP1PaVjaa	I'm just wondering why this question about mom is in marriage and divorce actually.
af2bb29a607e269fd8497ceea873f78faa	tell him that in your defense, you are a cheating sack of sh!t.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I think you are practicing writing fiction.  Please keep your day job.  Your fiction is really lame and pathetic.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	You cheated and got caught! It's as simple as that. Your husband should kick you out and divorce you. You are so LOW!|`|bjsOnyPkaa	At least you could have wet the hair and thrown some water on the bathroom floor to make it look like you just got out of the shower. Also you state that the same thing happened to your husband with the same friend? That is really gross.|`|CxRJwJsraa	you should call the POLICE because you were RAPED!<br>  <br>  seriously, if what you're saying is really true, that is what you need to do.|`|TZw9Q7pOaa	You got caught cheating.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Who picked this friend?  I've never had any friends like this.|`|c2b14ee844cf4010737570b8f3293ab4aa	If your husband doesn't believe you, why would you think anyone else would ?  Ive had a few of my husband's so called friends come on to me,(once at a party , and another time at a cook out) They just grabbed me and kissed me, or tried to.Instead of likeing it, I was very upset about it, in both instances..<br>    What you did was plain nasty, you are a cheap ****..|`|wuBIF9aPaa	lol<br>  so his penis fell into your vagina? <br>  lol!!!!<br>  it felt good so you allowed his penis to stay? <br>  you are SOOOOO full of crap.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Your husband is smart enough not to believe a lie.|`|874EAxkfaa	this friend actually dropped his wanker into your husbands bum as he picked trash? i am lmao, good story.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Get out of here with your faux question.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	YOU ARE SO FULL OF CRAP!!!|`|Ud1L9Wayaa	Wow....your friend needs to keep his trousers on !!!|`|7e8NN8saaa	yeah right. Are we trolling or just a tramp trying to rationalize cheating?|`|09k5GLLkaa	LMAO it felt good and you moaned and you didn't cheat and blah blah blah........BUSTED<br>  LMAO  you are one funny gal. <br>  Help? LMAO again....help in what way? <br>  CHEATER.......<br>  HOW SICK CAN YOU BE?|`|h4iM89Zdaa	No one is gonna buy that one. You are in trouble unless your husband is an idiot or incredibly naive.|`|mQg5SVQXaa	If he allows his mates to come over while he isn't home, then he really can't say too much.|`|ABD9wkIuaa	BUSTED!!!!|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	If your husband believes your story then he is really stupid.|`|TMm4pebPaa	Skank!! Oh I just had to edit my response after reading the details.  Who is this "mate?" All you guys are freaks! Why dont u, ur hubby and this guy just do a 3-way already! LOL LOL.I can't stop laughing.|`|B53KDVuJaa	You got busted! I hope he dumps your ***.|`|T22OjCMRaa	Is this fake? Come on!|`|lckgvz2laa	lmao...you are an idiot if you think anyone would believe that.
vN8kxNoQaa	I think you should be very careful a man at that age is not suited for a young girl like you they can be very hard for you to understand. Hey i will email you cos i once had this sorta problem lol|`|Lw5lCNwzaa	It isn't fair to keep secrets from your parents. When I was in high school, there were a lot of things I never told them. They eventually found out and went balistic! But ya know what was funny? They got angry because I DIDN'T TELL THEM FIRST. Tell your parents. Who knows, they might like the person you're dating.  And besides, they raised you, they deserve to know. It'd be worse not to tell them. Think about it.|`|wPIS3uM2aa	im about your age, and i know my parents wouldnt like it at all. first of all, that person could end up hurting you in some way, since youre so much younger. they probably wont understand, but maybe if theyve known him/her for a long time they might be okay with it...|`|t0V1UbyNaa	first of all you better tell them soon. Not to sound like mean but i think that is just sick but my stepson is 17 with a 14  year old some say age is only a number but come on what can you two really have in common??|`|adbbcddc1ab24b792f15fe8d967c6e54aa	Depends how close you are with your family , just tell them ,true an simple ,  then see how they react and act accordingly , do not lie as it will not help ...|`|rgwatxBhaa	Could be a little bit to much of an age differance, but its your choise<br>  <br>  <br>  remember: Its ILLEGAL to have sex under the age of 16 in the UK|`|XKUnUFZpaa	um... <br>  you dont wanna be a parent at the age of bloody 14 dump him|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's better to be open with them about this. <br>  <br>  You know your parents better, but generally if they feel you've been sneaking around with someone a lot older (in 10 years time this age difference won't matter a jot), they won't like it.<br>  <br>  Bring him home, introduce him to your parents, let them get to know him, and he should only tell his age if they ask him. He should not lie. He should be direct and honest with them, and see you home safely every time you go out.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	That depends, I do not know you and how mature you are.|`|wjPcDlK7aa	They'll be quite upset. Especially if you've been going out with him for quite a while. If you tell them, they will probably be angry and expect you to break up with or they'll have a very, very long discussion with you about safe sex etc.. haha parents always do that. Well, mothers do anyway. <br>  <br>  I think maybe you should keep it on the d-low for a little bit. Or, possibly introduce your boyfriend to your parents, but say he's only your friend. If they get worried over you having a friend who is 19, then you'll probably be able to guess what they would do if they found out he was your boyfriend :) <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Hae8acnpaa	You have to ask yourself what a 19 year old young man sees in a 14 year old schoolgirl? The age gap is too much at your age and your parents will  not be happy. You know this if you are honest with yourself and nothing you can say or do will change how your parents will react.<br>  <br>  You should not be with someone so much older. There are no grey areas it is not acceptable.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	The 14  bit is worrying but not the 5 year gap..You are still a child and he is a young man,that's really the problem and i don't see any parent liking this situaton..If i were you i would introduce this young man sooner rather than later and see what comes out of it but there is no point in trying to keep it a secret..........|`|DRGchuRGaa	wow. if i was yo paw... i would kik both yo asses...<br>   you gotta be kiddin' right?|`|uVuYdcRcaa	No way on earth would any parent be happy about this.<br>  <br>  You are a child and your boyfriend is an adult in the eyes of the law - that makes what he doing almost child abuse, he can even technically be seen as a paedophile.<br>  <br>  Your parents will obviously want you to be happy but not with an 19 year old man.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself seriously, what does he see in you? I am guessing all he wants is sex and I pray that you have not lost your virginity to this guy.<br>  <br>  If you like this guy and he likes you then ask him to wait till you at the age of consent.<br>  <br>  Lx|`|OlK0Pa1Gaa	It really depends on the parents. My parents for example would forbid me from seeing her and I'm a guy! That shows how strict mine are. But it depends on the parents. I think they will be angry and upset because you are 14 so they still protect you and love you and don't want you hurt.|`|xDom6mr3aa	If I was your father I would ban you from leaving the house forever.<br>  <br>  a 19 yr old really? why?  whats wrong with another 14 yr old like yourself? oh let me guess you're in love?<br>  <br>  5 years at that age is a little too much, and shame on him, bloody pedo!|`|wyAbkG3oaa	Dont think they will be happy because your underage.|`|QilfSBfsaa	They will tell you to concentrate on your school works.|`|VVqGQfJYaa	dnt tell them<br>  <br>  itll be fun atm but prbz wnt last im afraid to say<br>  <br>  the difference in maturity is too big!|`|673B37CKaa	Don't tell them? <br>  <br>  lol|`|hCV5Hyqfaa	they'll spank you to next friday fool
JEteneuUaa	Tell dad to stop being emo|`|NqMmvvgVaa	It's not really unusual for your Dad to love your Mum, be thankful that he does, a lot of kids don't get to see that.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	There is nothing wrong with your dad telling you that he loves your mom. Alot of men don't say things like that not even to their wife's. I don't remember my dad ever saying anything like that about my mom.
Vv7a31pmaa	no.|`|lEdBY8Chaa	all these people themselves wouldnt just go for it cause im in the same situation you are now! what i have done was in class try to sit closer...start up a conversation with your buddies to where she can hear and then start doing weird stuff like messing with your hands and asking your friend if he can do that double jointed thing and that will get her attention and she will go for it....thats what he did to me in class today but i stil dont know if i like him...=/|`|WWCfdgd0aa	tell her tell her!<br>  :D|`|i7rEzn8daa	is she already in a relationship?<br>  anywho... ask your friend what her name is...<br>  the better thing to do though is ask her yourself. ;)<br>  go for it ;))|`|1UZMBxpeaa	just ask your friend about her and if she is single then start up a conversation!|`|uWJJyNR3aa	yeahhh. definitely do it.|`|AA10126871	You should definitely ask for her name, I don't think that will cause any harm!  Asking for her name isn't asking her out, so I don't think it would piss off any boyfriend, if she had one... plus, I'll doubt he'll find out unless she tells him - in which would set you in the clear, because I don't think you'd want a girl like that anyway :)|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Don't go through the friend.  Be direct and get her name and number without the help.  Says you have a ton of confidence, which will make all the difference.|`|XCqKLILMaa	well, go for it. but if you're unstable like that, then make sure you don't hurt her and break her heart. go for it, only if you KNOW you're ready for a relationship.|`|nq7QXxIfaa	YES!<br>  im a girl,even tho the girl might be in a relationship ,girls like to know who likes them.<br>  <br>  go for it,she wouldnt be looking at you if she had a bf<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  i hope you get her.|`|MXGFGBtZaa	"frequently disappointed with girls who are already in a relationship"?<br>  What the helll?!<br>  <br>  Are you sure you even want a girlfriend?<br>  <br>  Guhhh|`|1YcBkx9Taa	ask her for sex, if she says no then leave it|`|AA10392394	a good way to get her attention:  barf all over her!  what have you got to lose?|`|Y5rK9zQAaa	go for it! i would want a boy that likes me to know my name.. lol<br>  you'll never know if you don't try|`|X4i2jej5aa	Don't be a scared, just ask her what her name is. If your friend starts asking questions, just tell her honestly, that you think she's cute. Too high of on expectations are bad, I use to have a lot too, but as I grow older and understand more, my expectations became lower because I realized that I really like the person when we have fun together, and nothing else matters, well, their personalities are important too, still. Take a chance, make a risk, just go for it, you mite end up with a pleasant surprise.|`|anLDrJDOaa	if oyu like some one, get the info from that girl yourself, it lets her know your confident, and you dont feel intimidated by her!<br>  just a tip, you probably shouldnt set your standards so high! you act like you dont even want a girlfriend. but if the girls you like have boyfrinds, then find cute girls who are single. i hope it all works out for you!<br>  Blessings-S.M|`|VGRah7Xuaa	you should definitely go for it!! you never know until you try!! she could even be "the one"|`|XDLnrARuaa	i think you should just go for it....i mean what will it hurt??and i think u should ask her yourself....she will see your confidence and maybe she likes you too but is too shy to say anything......i think that maybe if you make the first move and at least talk to her.....you may be suprised at what happens:)|`|H7CMI42Paa	I really think you should.<br>  If you are interested, and she has a man, then at least you have tried...<br>  How would you feel if you find out she likes you too but you were too scared to go up to her and talk to her and she thinks you feel nothing?|`|NgtigGIzaa	if you make the first move it will be easier for her to relate to you if you don't say anything than you will never know she could like you also if you ask it shows that you have an interest in getting to know her|`|vPhOS0O3aa	if she already caught your attention by just htat its time to get her namme buddy<br>  she is attracted to you<br>  this just happened with me this guy foun dout this stuff about me and it made me feel very special|`|tu1m1dkoaa	I would have one of your close friends go ask that dude or someone else what her name is so that way they can't run off and say something like that then like go up to her and be like Your (her name) right? :)|`|UUjM0Tbdaa	definately try.

I've been like that this year.<br>  Lost my interest in boys, and only had it back for like two months and then got bored with them again.<br>  It's like playing a game you get tired of.|`|xyW8PsfUaa	Almost the same thing happened to me except for this guy secretly told me that he liked me but then when his friends found out, he started totally ignoring me and ever since i havent liked neone else. I think it's just cuz ur heart is broken cuz that guy was perfect.|`|caP7g9WEaa	My guess would be that you still feel like you're going out with the other guy.  You don't really want to go out with or think about other guys because you feel like you're still dating him.  If I were you, I would call him up and maybe hang out or something.  See if it clears some stuff up.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  nicole|`|jxizzHL1aa	You're done with boys, you're looking for a Man now.|`|YbnEr1z7aa	go have sex, then i think you will like boys|`|ik9hP6FBaa	well you don't have to constantly like someone, i believe that you are like this because you are not finding someone that you are interested in emotionally, the feeling that you felt for that guy will eventually come back when you meet the right person. so don't worry, its normal not to have interests in guys but it will come back. i promise :)|`|SlmMuJtPaa	Well maybe it's because you're maturing and it isn't about the looks anymore. I think you're looking for something else now. Don't worry your not going crazy, thinking your crazy is only going to make you think your crazier. So relax, take some time for yourself and Mr Prince will pop up when you least expect it.|`|CVvYhEfGaa	your probably more hurt about this then you let yourself believe, your just not ready to try again, nothing wrong with that, just wait a little, that attraction will come back...<br>  unless you are a lez and just dont know it yet. who knows. XD XD|`|d1APITmkaa	maybe it hurt your feelings and you are distancing yourself.|`|vWXSQDWlaa	ur changing thats fine.|`|kCUpmYrBaa	i think ur still heartbroken...try talking to him!|`|Lw5lCNwzaa	When a guy gets very close to you and then suddenly drifts off like that, it's very confusing. It's not that you have no interest in men, it's that you're still interested in this one. You're confused and don't know why things just sort of got dropped out of nowhere. There are 2 options. #1 You can call him, ask him what's up and talk things out, it's part of a relationship and it might just do you both some good. It could really get things out in the air that never were before. or #2 You could try your best to get over this guy. If a guy asks you out and you find him attractive, give him a try. What's there to lose?

In time, you will forget about him and start being attracted to other guys.|`|AA10909774	it seems like maybe u weren't ready for ur relationship to end (since u wanted him to end). u need closure and that's going to happen when u are 100% over him. of course, u just might not be meeting any interesting people.|`|0xU3YhGhaa	haha, don't worry i understand that feeling :) Sometimes you just need a break from them.|`|uHcyBY2jaa	I think every girl goes through this stage .  you will bounce back and start finding guys interesting again no need to worry|`|6a8Ydw5Zaa	yep masterbate it should turn ur switch back on haha

How long have you known your' ex-boyfriend for? Can you trust him again? Consider all of these and then make up an answer for your self. Don't listen to other people it's your life.|`|SLNd60cCaa	How many times a week do you ask this question? YES
IKXZZDH9aa	Nope, but they will drop you for lying to them, non-payment, conflicting views making them incapable of representing you, etc...|`|0AShsMsoaa	actually, yes, i had a friend who was dropped by her attorney because she adamantly refused to take the attorneys advice.  she just wanted revenge, and would not listen to any reasoning.  and the attorney just wanted her to grow up and get the business of her divorce over with, and got tired of her craziness.  <br>  <br>  she is not my friend anymore and is still crazy.|`|UdfYnHJ6aa	Almost.  I am very naive to begin with- especially about attorneys.  I hired my attorney in May of last year and my estranged husband was waiting for the papers to be served.  I thought my attorney would file my divorce immediately-  but he didn't.  Two weeks elapsed and my estranged husband became very impatient and in disbelief that I filed, since he didn't know whether or not to hire an attorney.  I emailed my attorney and called him with without a response.  My estranged husband called also.  This greatly upset my attorney who called me and told me to come pick up the check and find another attorney since he wasn't fast enough for me.  Being the sensitive person I am, I began to cry and he asked me if I wanted to hire another attorney.   I didn't want to go through the hassle again and became overcome with shock (and tears).  When I reminded him that our pastor from church referred him he cooled down.  I guess he sees so many clients he forgot that we belong to the same church?   He then told me he would work on getting it filed in court that week, and he did.  I of course, did apologize and he reciprocated.  I guess what upset him is the low retainer fee we mutually agreed on (as a referral from our pastor) and he probably wanted more money.   I guess there are some good attorneys.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	if that has happened, i would take a serious look at yourself. was it money matters or something else. if it was money, well you would know why they dropped you. if it was others, i am sure you know why that has happened too.

mFyTTvzQaa	thats a very good thing to do.....im doing that too! =) but i dont hav a ring or anything i dont need one i aready kno im not gonna hav sex until im married.....and yes, im SURE God will giv u a pure guy.....there R very nice guys out there  =)|`|kbz5S3waaa	yes, there are plenty of men who will appreciate your decision. A couple that lives near us got married in a court even, and didn't consummate the marriage until they got their official church ceremony. (they actually haven't consummated that one either, they're only going to have sex for procreation - that's a bit too far for me)<br>  <br>  God Bless you and your journey.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	God doesn't deliver husbands.<br>  <br>  If you want to save it, save it.  You don't need a ring to save it...|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I'm sure those guys exist. It's the guys that will lie about it that you want to watch out for. I'm wondering how this has any bearing on your decision? When you make a decision like this, it should be for your personal reasons. Stick to your guns and worry about your future husband when you eventually meet him. <br>  <br>  I tried to be "pure" back in the 80's before it was hip to do so. I made it to about 19 before my curiosity got the best of me and I gave in. I will tell you that it's a challenge as you get older and college did me in!  I wasn't worried at all about if my future husband would be "pure" or not, it honestly never crossed my mind. If I didn't give in, and he wasn't "pure" I don't think it would have affected me in the least. My decision was about me and not something I was trying to force on another person. If that would have been a sticking point, I would have missed out on a wonderful 17 year marriage and 4 beautiful children. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Dear heart,<br>  I can't tell you how many times I've seen God bring husbands for women.  He LOVES to answer this one!  You figure out what you want and don't want and tell God to work it out for you in His time, in His way.  Then you just go on with your business of growing up and he will take care of this.  I am absolutely positive of this.  I've seen many women my age too (60's) when you aren't supposed to be able to find men.|`|MOMb0Amoaa	That is very wise of you.  I play pure too.  I have never let a guy do anything to me and i am now looking for a husband.  <br>  <br>  I would say though not in a large amount, you surely can find pure guys out there.  Guys who are strict christian or who are strict in their religions are often against pre-marital sex.  But again, it is going to be very hard for you to find someone like that in this age and time.  But yes there are people like that out there.<br>  <br>  (and trust me...no matter how much guys deny this but they always deep down appreciate and have alot of respect for girls who save themselves for their true partner who they would like to marry)<br>  <br>  Answer mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtUOX0o1iEcnKXT3OqX9BPHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227123443AAKLTEN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OHfZFR31aa	Sure there are guys who want a pure wife. There are plenty of singles groups at churches and even Christian dating sites where you can find like minded men|`|L2Tvu7VLaa	My husband LOVES that I remained pure for him. It made him comfortable knowing that I had no one to compare him too. It also made him feel special that I thought about him and wanting to be a special bride for him years before we ever even met. There are a lot of guys who feel that way. my brothers also both remained pure until marriage. So there are definitely guys out their that do. In fact even though my Mom and Step-Dad were both experienced from previous marriages they waited till they were married as well. So your certainly not alone in your promise.<br>  <br>  BTW. This can be a very VERY hard promise to keep as you get older. No matter how set you are right now. My best advice to you is to not go towards temptation. The Lords prayer says "Lead me not into temptation" not "take me out of temptation after i get there" Don't be alone with a guy. Take dates in public places. When you are dating and want a movie night at home have someone else home at the same time. If you don't give yourself the opportunity then it will be easier not to break a promise that means so much to you and your future husband.<br>  <br>  Congratz on your promise and Self Discipline!!!|`|muTZeGOgaa	To quote my husband (who was a virgin when we met, but I was not), "You have so much more to offer me than just first dibs on your vagina."<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are plenty of men who still value virginity for whatever reason. I'm sure if you try hard enough, you might even find one. Good luck!|`|a123cdea49e8f502487a7c5b0eeb55a0aa	im a huge jonas brothers fan and it seems like everyone is going pure so i wouldnt worry about it, lots of boys are becoming pure|`|AA12341821	It will happen, just stick to your guns.

Actions don't match words, and or are self contradicting.<br>  <br>  She needs to see a counsellor and get herself sorted out. As long as she is waffling between you and her ex, you will never know if she is telling you the truth or him. This is not a good basis for marriage.|`|an1EMiFkaa	Your nuts if you marry her!|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	It sounds like she has programmed herself to react to certain situations.

Wouldnt worry about them too much as you seem to have the girl now. Congrats and good luck|`|wuBIF9aPaa	actions speak louder than words.  <br>  u deserve better.|`|AA10861417	She is definitely sending out mixed signals.  Is it to make her X jealous?   Or does she still have feelings for him.    I think you should sit down and talk to her.  If she is marrying you - she should be proud and only say good things about you....  From the outside looking in....it seems like she isn't really sure - but she will "try" to marry you.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	You aren't confused or you wouldn't be asking the question.<br>  <br>  She is telling you in so many ways what kind of person she is. She likes the attention and affection that her words bring for you and for her ex.<br>  <br>  If you are just a glutton for heart ache continue with what you are doing. She will inevitably be saying those same words to some other guy and you will be the ex she will  be referring to if she hasn't already.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Confused?  Have a long engagement!|`|KEUFaCkUaa	oh it's not that bad.  theres a lot more guys than you that are p*ssy whipped by dirty whores.|`|7e8NN8saaa	I have heard what she is saying - not much about what she is doing....<br>  <br>  But I would be worried that she is still having conversations with her ex and telling him she still cares. She sounds a bit immature and confused - especially if she is smoking, drinking and clubbing. <br>  <br>  I would watch her actions for a while - and don't marry her until you are more certain of her feeling and her maturity.  It's a lot easier to break an engagement than to get a divorce.  Also - Do NOT have children with this woman until you are certain she is mature enough to deal with them - or you may have some pretty messed up kids.

You're only hurting yourself.|`|1epMphSmaa	I think he's handling it very calmly and intelligently.

About him being jealous well that could be the main reason i mean its going to take awhile for him to regain trust in you and what you do cuz of that little so called accident. To be honest there really isn't much you can do but give him some time and show him some respect and affection and let him know that you messed up really bad and that your truly sorry..

Did this guy seem really sweet when you first met him, but steadily got more "protective"? What he's done and said goes WELL beyond simple overprotection or jealousy. In cases of serious dating abuse, things like these are almost always the beginning. watch for signs like unnecessary snooping through your texts and emails and ANY physical threats. Use your own judgement, but if I were you, I'd get the hell out of there before something more serious happens.|`|wtFP7WB0aa	you don't show him anything, he sounds dangerous.<br>  <br>  He seems to be controlling and violent, i would end the <br>  relationship while you can.<br>  <br>  Find someone whos patient, kind and respectful!  :)|`|huGTOQrwaa	He's worried about losing you.

Figure out your motivations for being with this man and if they are reasonable he needs to go through anger management, you need to not kiss other guys on accident, and you have to work it out together. <br>  <br>  If you do not know why you are dating him, if this is just a relationship of convenience, find a friend you can stay with and dump the abuser. When you go back to get your things, DO NOT go alone. Bring a police escort if you must, he will be angry and probably physically abusive.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

When there is jealousy in a relationship,  you are headed down a road to disaster.<br>  <br>  Love is not like that.  When you love a person you walk beside him and not under his feet.

WtTUNC8Naa	Smile at him/her and make eye contact, but don't be creepy. If you two have not met, get to know him slowly (ie. Asking him for the time and then complimenting him on his watch). If he is a friend, start flirting slightly. <br>  <br>  When conversing with your crush, make sure that you spend at least as much time listening as you do talking. <br>  <br>  Pay attention to hygeine. Dress in clothes you feel comfortable and attractive in. Show a little skin but not too much that you look like you should be standing on a street corner<br>  <br>  Spend time with your crush but do not stalk him. i.e. No pictures of him in your locker unless you guys are friends and the picture is of both of you (photoshop doesn't count!) <br>  <br>  Avoid drama. Don't get your friends to ask him out for you,and don't get your friends to ask if he likes you etc. (Very Important!) But, you could always have your friends do a lil investigating for you. To see if he might be interested. But most guys actually like the girl to come up to them, not her friends.<br>  <br>  Be careful when asking friends to ask him if he likes you. This only works if they are mutual friends, loyal to you, and preferably guys so he won't know that you put them up to it. <br>  <br>  Don't tell them that you like them, just make them like you. Once you guys are on a flirty basis you may ask him out, just don't actually say "I like you". Doing so leaves you open for rejection. <br>  If he says yes, cool. You guys are now dating. <br>  <br>  Don't fear if you are rejected. Here is where the asking out technique is preferable to outright declaring your love for them. If you say "Wanna see a movie Friday night" and he says "I don't like you in that way" you can respond "Wow, no offense, but I wasn't asking you out, a bunch of us are going." Then make sure that a bunch of your friends come to the movie. <br>  <br>  Make sure that, if a bunch of you go somewhere, you sit next to him if you go to a movie/concert. If a concert, talk to him between songs. If at a movie, as you're leaving the theater, talk to him about subjects slightly more personal (Don't get too personal, you don't want to scare him!), such as problems with friends. This is great because it'll help you realize if he's really right for you, because if he's sensitive enough to comfort you, just keep trying. If he fails to do so, forget about him. <br>  <br>  <br>   Tips<br>  Make sure you dress nicely. <br>  Always be friendly, not just with your crush, but with everyone. It helps your crush notice how nice you are. Don't be overly peppy, however. A lot of guys (and girls!) find this annoying. <br>  If you truly want your crush to like you, try using a signature body spray. He will come to associate you with this lovely smell. Nothing too heavy. No one likes musk. Something like Chanel No. 5 is good for high school, later junior high can try Britney Spears perfumes, if you're under 10, stick with vanilla body spray.|`|uhN7WmXhaa	Make an appointment with him,so that he will know you and make an impression on your date that he will not forget. So by then after you have talk,for surely he will notice you and remember you whenever your path crosses.|`|c0plf0VLaa	When you know you're going to see him, wear something that makes you feel comfortable, cute && confident.

Like what my mom told me was it's always nice to be friends first and see if imeants meant to be before actually dating each other. If you two think you two were meant to be then you two should date. If u have anymore questions just email me at Mileshope28@gmail.com ok well good luck|`|wBXYRbhhaa	just be honest with people and mention that you like him, be mature about it though. <br>  When you are around him, just be yourself... act natural, don't be fake.

The transitory nature of life is the reason to cherish the  present moment. In many ways, you are very lucky: not only do you have a wonderful mother and enjoy a close relationship with her; you recognize the fact. Imagine how tragic it would be if you hadn't understood your good fortune until after she had gone? It would be equally sad if you allowed your fear of losing her to detract one iota from being a good and loving son to her right here - right now. Rather than obsessing about the future, use that energy to love your mom while she's here. Don't let a single opportunity pass to let her know how much she means to you. This is cliched, but "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."|`|nsWdlMcgaa	trust me i have the same thoughts about my whole family. but since your only 14 shes going to be around for a long long time. when the time comes, you will learn how to cope, and you will understand that she will be watching over you.|`|4TdBKpobaa	Why do you keep thinking she's going to die is the first question?

AA10479096	A career is a big deal. If you are lucky enough to have a real opportunity at something you love rather than something you have to do, you should take it. You can't be happy with someone else until you are happy with yourself.

And yes, I am in a loving relationship, while pursuing my career.<br>  <br>  Why? you ask? Well, basically because I know and always knew what I wanted. I have a goal in my life and pursuing it/accomplishing it completes me and makes me happy. Yes, a relationship, a lovely lady who loves me and whom I love, that's wonderful. Sex is wonderful too. But relationships come and go, your profession, your hopes and dreams, they don't.. they ARE you; well, at least a big part of you.<br>  <br>  My uncle was accepted in MIT (and was living in Panama at that time), he was a pioneer in terms of computer science. He was going to get a black belt in judo and he was a champion swimmer in Panama. He fell in love with a model. And guess what? She made him go to Madrid, Spain.. to live with her. And you know what happened 8 months later? She left him!... Now he is a clothes salesperson... he could have been working in NASA for all I know !<br>  <br>  Did he take the right decision? If she really loved him, she wouldn't have done that to him.. right. And it's also true that not all women would do that. But to tell you the truth, you can never be too sure.<br>  <br>  Your career defines you, and makes your way of life what it is. A relationship should be something additional.. a bonus to your already wonderful life, so that your career can then support it and a new family in the future.. you don't live on love. That's the cold truth. Another cold truth? A new relationship can give you the same feelings you felt in a previous one, and an inability to do so can only be because it's either a bad relationship or your own psychological problem (an imaginary problem).<br>  <br>  cheers|`|jjDZJmfpaa	The story of Scrooge has a good moral to it no matter what the generation.<br>  <br>  Personally, if a man is so work oriented and is focused in what more he can gain from work, he needs to stay with it until it is no longer his driving force. <br>  <br>  A man who allows his work having a means to an end and then seeks for a relationship because it was a part of his plan, he is the one who can sustain longevity and is faithful. He sees the importance of other people and knows that a career will leave him with many years of service and a gold watch in the end.<br>  <br>  Its A Wonderful Life is another one with a good moral at the end. One's life can change forever based on the character and integrity of another. It is what you put into it that measures the harvest you get out of it.

Perhaps before I had found love my answer would have been different. I know then I would have chosen my career, because that was all I dreamed of before was being successful in life. Now that I have found that man, I know that there is nothing I wouldn't give up for him. <br>  <br>  However, to each his own. I think some people are happier to be accomplished, and therein find their happiness. For me, this is not the case. They say money cannot make you happy. I strongly disagree. Money would not make me happy, but to some it is indeed the highlight of their life. Each person wants different things.|`|3Ewo8Pgzaa	It depends on what type of relationship.

You do not wear the band which symbolizes your marriage until it is slipped onto your finger in front of the person performing the marriage.  After you have repeated the vows, you will be asked to put the ring onto the finger to symbolize that the vows have been pledged.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	That would symbolize that you were already married.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	No.  Don't wear the band before you are married.|`|AA11984287	you can wear the band but it really isn't the thing to do. The putting on of the band is a huge part of the wedding ceremony. I would advise wearing it until the actual wedding mostly because you will get it scratched up (makes the pics look bad), maybe even lost. Best to wait until the ceremony itself and put on a nice sparkly ring.  As to what side, the band goes first then the engagement ring. Just remember, the band

My mother and her boyfriend were the very same way, and I can understand your negativity towards your stepdad because I felt that way for a very long time.<br>  <br>  Resenting your mom and stepdad won't change their behavior; harboring those kinds of feelings so deeply is dangerous. I would recommend staying with your mom for now and trying to think it through. That's what I did. <br>  <br>  Eventually, an adult, when you no longer live with her, you'll forget precisely what your disgust/hatred for her and your stepdad is like. Your only options will be to hate her, which will only weigh you down, or to shrug off the things about her you dislike.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

xbEmryTFaa	If she doesn't want to be your friend anymore then you can't make her. Not every friendship is meant to last forever. If I were you I would make a clean break from her and make some new friends. Even if you could find a way to "get her to think you're better than stacey" and start hanging out with you again it would still be awkward between you now. I think that you need to respect her wishes and find a new BFF.|`|cin3tjo8aa	that sucks<br>  :(<br>  well dont get too bummed out if things dont go the way you want.<br>  i suggest that you try to spend as much time with her.<br>  invite her to go shopping with you or just to your house.<br>  do fun stuff and maybe she wont ditch you.<br>  keep being a good friend to her <br>  but if she treats you badly <br>  dont hang out with her<br>  go out and make a new BFF|`|TlSUgrU3aa	well i think that your friend isnt a friend at all dont ever change who you are for no one if she thinks that way a bout <br>  you dont worry go on and find  better friend i know you can find one

1KjfZAWzaa	It means that he is a bit tired of your relationship. He isn't ruling out the possibility of getting back with you(far from it), but he does not want to date you right now for reasons that only he probably knows.<br>  <br>  "Doesn't want burn bridges" means "I don't want to do something I can't reverse." ... if he crosses a bridge, then burns it, he can't get back. If he drifts too far apart from you, he'd loose the possibility of going out with you again.<br>  <br>  "Prolli won't be soon" means he wants to take a break, and come back when he umm "feels like it" I suppose.
djUMvICoaa	If it's important to her to wear them, why not sell them to her?  That way when you are ready to step out you won't have to worry if they are still in style.

It sounds like you worked hard for these clothes and you still want them. If you are interested in getting them off your back. Why don't you give her just one thing. Give, don't loan.

I don't have a sister. But there is a limit to hw much a sister can be understanding. Its ur sister's fault to ruine her clothes...but as u stated she wants to use the clothes u had bought with ur own money. I would be scared to lend an expensive clothing to her since there is higher chances to not being able to wear the clothing again. So, i don't think u are in the wrong and that u have been more then a gd sis by buying for her clothes with ur own money.This is my opinion.=0)

It's because he has always had some kind of feelings for me. (I'm not just saying this, he has actually told me) and so he doesn't like to see me with anyone else, but yet he still doesn't want to leave his girlfriend. He'll get over it, and if he doesn't then thats his problem.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	If he has a girlfriend... then ask him what's his problem. You guys are both dating people now so you are even.

djUMvICoaa	Part of this is your own doing you know, the part  where you gave him money in the first place.  Now he has no incentive to work, you will be there to bail him out.  And now he has become an abuser, mentally abusing you with his death threats.  If you really want to stop this cycle of abuse and aiding, the next time he threatens to commit suicide, call the cops and tell them what he is doing.  You are going to have to teach him some tough love here.  And you don't have to listen to him rant either, if by phone hang up, if he comes over call the cops.  What will he end up doing?  It's hard to say but so far he knows he has a payback for those threats.  What if he doesn't get a payback anymore?  Do you really think he would kill himself?  Call the cops again.  It's not right for a parent to be held captive by their own child, having to worry what they might do to themselves.  But can you afford to let him drag you down, to drain you of your much needed money while he does nothing?  It may be hard but it is what you have to do.  The only other thing I would say about this is that I believe he is also suffering from lack of exercise, not moving waste products from his system properly and it is affecting his mental state.  Only if you can get him out on long walks and jogging is better will you have a chance of him breaking out of this.  Lack of exercise causes waste products to back up when they back up other body functions slow down and don't operate correctly and eventually this all reaches the brain and it starts to mess up, causing one not to feel good and to withdrawl even more and it gets worse.|`|HhQH7jrRaa	He needs to see a therapist of some sort. <br>  He may have depression.|`|JX0I6x1paa	Tell him you are no longer his bank, that he is a grown man and it is high time he took care of himself.  Tell him he needs to get a job and face his responsibility to be his own carer.<br>  <br>  I know that's all easier said than done.  You are his mother and you feel responsible for him but you were only responsible for him while he was a minor.  Now it's time to give yourself permission to back off.  In the long run you will be making a man out of him.  Right now he's not a man, certainly not a responsible one.  I know you feel guilty but really you are not doing him any favours by bailing him out.  It's time he stood on his own two feet.  <br>  <br>  Remind yourself that you are doing this for his own good and you have nothing to feel guilty about.  Stand your ground and don't take any abuse from him.  He'll get the message.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i am a single mother as well.. and i know as a mother we would do anything to help our kids and see the happy and safe.. but you have to understand that he isnt a child he is an adult and he has to step up to being a man and responsible  for himself.. he is manipulating u  that i agree.. but u have to show him tough love.. let him know u cant help him with money and what u can do is find him help for the addiction he has towards video games m computerm etc... u can not continue to solve his problems if he isnt  willing to change his ways.. he is your only son.. but its time he realize  he cant be manipulating u anymore...  it isnt easy but u have to teach him tough love or else u will feel  trap and  guilty for his actions.. even tho u are not since he is an adult and makes his own choices..  good luck|`|C9BctAMQaa	Help him get a girlfriend, or set him up on a date.<br>  <br>  It will build his confidence up, make him happier and encourage him to do something with his life.|`|fR5vfbKGaa	STOP being his enabler, tell him NO MORE !!!. of course he is angry with you for not giving him what he wants because you have  given money  in the past.make him stand on his own  two feet and get off of yours, until you do he will  only get worse.he thinks " why hold a job I got mom she gives me everything I ask for. please do your self a favor stop this or he will never take care of himself.
BE7b99okaa	next time he does it, say to him "if you took a closer look, you'd see that he isn't any more nerdy then you are.' wither that or if he makes fun of a specific thing, say 'didn't you do that this morning?'<br>  if you want to be a bit more mature, however, maybe you should just tell him to stop making fun of people... :P
H2qEN27daa	If the you were invited as "your name and Guest" then I assume you would write<br>  <br>  M My Name + 1 (or + Guest)<br>  <br>  _X Delightfully Accept<br>  __ Regretfully Decline<br>  <br>  Please Initial your choice of entree: <br>  __2_ Entree #1 ___ Entree #2<br>  <br>  i dunno , i guess you'll have the same entree. <br>  <br>  Or you can ask. I dont think its wrong. Call them and say listen, I dont want to mess something up over a silly rsvp so guide me so I dont screw up! ;) im sure its not a problem|`|ifgzHzA3aa	You would write on the line with the "M" your name and your guest's name.  i.e. Ms. Amanda Smith and Mr. Robert Bob.  Then you put '2' on the line next to "delightfully accept"  and then put your initals next to your choice of entree and his initials next to his choice of entree.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	you would put it in the food option area.  like, if one of you wanted entree #1 and the other wanted entree #2, you would put a 1 in each space then the bride and groom would add them up|`|HiSVA9p8aa	In the space write:<br>  <br>  Ms Mary Smith and Guest<br>  <br>  Check the "delightfully accept" spot.<br>  <br>  In the entrees, put the count of entries in the space.  Either a 2 in one of the spots or a 1 in each spot.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about being "correct".  People are so happy that you ARE replying.

Next to the M you fill in Ms. Your Name and Your Guest Name, write them out.  If you put both names on the top line, they assume two of you are coming when you check accept or decline.  Then you check which entree each of you want.  If you put only your name on the M__________ line it means only you are coming, so they know only one entree is needed.  Got it?|`|AA11280073	You cannot bring a guest unless that person is specifically invited. Weddings are very expensive. If everyone or even a few people brought an uninvited guest, the cost would be more than the couple can afford. It is very rude to expect to be able to bring your own guest to this wedding.|`|gK5nobhbaa	well for my wedding RSVP card, what most people did is next to accept/ entree option they put a number 1,2,4 etc.  So you could put 2 next to accept and either one or two next to the entree selections.  Hope this helps!|`|AA10604036	I'd respond as "Ms. Jane Smith and Guest (TBD)".  This tells the Bride that you will be attending with a guest who is, as of yet, To Be Determined.  Then I'd just choose one of each entree (unless one looks awful) and allow my guest to choose their favorite at the reception.<br>  <br>  However...<br>  <br>  Some Brides will add "and Guest" just to be polite, in case you have a significant person in your life they don't know about.  If you think this might be the case, you might consider accepting just for yourself as the unattached person you are.  <br>  <br>  Who knows, the right one for you may be filling out their response card as a single person too and your chance meeting at the wedding could lead to a romance of your own!<br>  <br>  Have Fun!!|`|dpk9n2SSaa	What did the envelope say? The envelope should have everyone invited listed. Did it just say your name? If so, it is just for you and you cannot bring a guest. If it is for you and a guest, accept and choose how many entrees of #1 or #2.

If you really trust him then I dont think there is anything to worry about.  If u do trust him take all those bad thoughts your thinkng and throw them out the door|`|hF6uZqWRaa	you should be cool about it until you start feeling that theres something more or see something you dont really like. for example flurting or flurty text messages. in my relationship no guys are allowed to contact me and no girls are allowed to contact him...that way we both just stay out of trouble.|`|zGZe0mt8aa	i think the fact is that you are jealous.<br>  but first you have to trust him unless you didn't find him cheating on you.<br>  a lot of boy doesn't like girls like you ,they don't feel comfortable.|`|RqQ0K32Baa	If he's with you be confident and know you're probably better than the other girls.<br>  <br>  And if he does cheat on you, well then you're damn sure you're better.

It is never good when boys have girlfriends, because they always end up doing something and ruining that relationship.|`|KhvXdMpNaa	you should be a profesional nudist of course!!! its relaxing : )|`|AsBgZDhVaa	Be cool unless you catch him. I have a lot of guy friends I would never ever date. So ya know...|`|NxBYuOzbaa	Well, the logical thing to do would be to trust him because every guy has friends that are girls (and girls have friends that are guys), so you can't really get mad over that. <br>  <br>  But then again, other girls are super jealous, like me. I CANNOT see my hubby around other girls and I'm lucky because he has NO friends that are girls.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing though, if he had female friends BEFORE the relationship, let it be and trust him until he does somthing to loose your trust (IF he ever does) but I don't think that there should be anymore female friends other than the ones BEFORE the relationship. He shouldn't need anyone else but you. That's just how I see it.<br>  <br>  Be cool, unles something he does something wrong.|`|fvw664Ziaa	No(:<br>  don't be worried...|`|ib3SNK40aa	Don't be suspicious but don't be stupid about it either. Be cautious. And if it bothers you so much tell him about it. If it's a big issue for you and he won't give up being friends with them then maybe it's time to move on. Try being friends with other guys and see if he gets jealous. If he does then maybe he is cheating because it would be going through his mind that when he hangs out with other girls that's what he does so he would assume that's what you're doing.|`|AjeNkvjlaa	yeah seriously theres nothing to worry about<br>  unless you actualy see any evidence of him cheating you will have to trust him<br>  you're allowed to have boys who are friends right? so he should be able to have girls who are friends<br>  the point is, he goes out with you, so he has made the decision to be commited to you, i wouldn't worry about it :)|`|5XYlHv6Paa	If you can't trust him, dump him. Rememeber to always look attractive or your man will cheat.|`|o8LX83jVaa	um well you should never be suspicious of him! i mean really! I am friends with soo many guys and i don't like them! just because he is friends with them doesn't mean that he likes them! i mean come on! would you be worrried if he hangs around his guy friends a lot? if they are just friends, then there is really no difference.|`|S2LH6L8Uaa	Well, im NOT telling you to DUMP him but if you get the feeling that he is cheating on DUMP da guy BUT only if you have prove that he is.<br>  <br>  Always remember to: Look good for your Man, and always deal with him Professional when that is the case|`|mTFfFZCnaa	I think he is not cheating. Yeah time will tell. Just observe him if he will make mistake.

mx3gFmIKaa	Its very large.  It is a reputable seller, the price is good, the color and clarity are excellent.  I'd want more, before spending 8 grand I'd want all the specs on that cert, that its certified is excellent.  Seeing a copy of the cert is much more important than seeing it in person.  I would want to know the measurements, cut grading, symmetry, polish, table, depth, girdle, fluorescence, and more about the enhancement.  Sometimes the grading enhancement involves drilling that makes the diamond weaker, you don't want that with such a large diamond.  I agree buying online is the way to go, mine came from <a href="http://www.bluenile.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluenile.com</a>   If this is her style after considering the other specs and the clarity enhancement procedures I'd consider it.  Personally its too much for my style.  The price isn't, nor the color, clarity, just the size.  Also the size of the shank (width of ring) is substantial.<br>  <br>  I'd also want to know the height of the ring from the shoulders, the higher it sits the more it catches and princesses are cut deeper than most other cuts with 70 percent of the diamond or so under the ring, so that would be a deterrent for myself<br>  <br>  A diamond is an investment, naturally something this expensive would be covered under your personal articles insurance and would be replaced for the appraisal value should it be lost, so that is not a concern.|`|4lL34wJnaa	It's WAY to big for any woman to feel comfortable wearing it on a daily basis!  I also have never heard of the certification company.  It is certainly a decent quality stone, but usually VS is broken down in VS1 and VS2, or at least GIA does it that way.  I wouldn't trust buying a stone on ebay unless you can get a return policy that will enable you to take it to a jeweler for appraisal and if the ring is not as good as they claim, you can then return it<br>  <br>  It is not my style personally.  When I my fiance and I were looking at rings I told him I wanted something between .5 carat and 1 carat.  He bought my a GORGEOUS .75 carat F/VS1 heart-shaped solitaire with GIA certification papers.  I have very small hands and feel that large stones don't look right on me.  I also would hate to have a stone that large chip or fall out or get stolen!  I wouldn't trust a ring you don't see in person first.  You should go to a reputable jeweler for an engagement ring, not a random seller on the internet!  It's too important to leave to chance!|`|HQsmRzPsaa	personally it is not my style. i have a ring that has a round center stone, one round side stone on each side of that, and 3 smaller round stones going down each side. i love my ring. plus that one is $8,000 and that's great if you are willing to spend it but mine i think want under $2,000 and i'd be worried to have that much money on my finger! good luck!|`|w1necKzYaa	I think a round cut would look alot better but I also think that a 3 1/2 CT is too big! some women like them big others like them to fit nicely on their hand! (big stones are very hard to do normal around the house things while wearing!)|`|3xMQW0A6aa	DAMN! is all i have to say... anything that costs that much passes the test!|`|7CKipTZOaa	Its a bit flashy for my tastes|`|uTdEdpAeaa	it's an enhanced diamond which means the value of the stone compared to another stone of the same carat weight, color, and clarity doesn't hold that much value to it. the diamond has been tweaked and basically didn't come out of the ground that way so be careful about buying enhanced diamonds. a diamond that hasn't been enhanced holds more value to it so that it's more desirable then one that is enhanced. then they enhance a diamond there are tiny little holes that the drill and fill to clear up the stone a bit more so that can also be unstable for the stone as well.<br>  <br>  a 2.3 ct stone g/vs2 that is not enhanced will value over 30k so thats a huge difference from over 8k to 30k that alone should tell you something.|`|qxlvhk52aa	it's too masculine. i don't know your girlfriends style but that ring is definitely for a certain taste. also consider if it's going to be a hassle to wear it. will it catch on EVERYTHING? will it overpower her finger? i would keep that type of ring for an anniversary surprise 10 or 15 years down the road. here's my ring: <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=111627750&albumID=0&imageID=36770452" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a><br>  oh yeah, and i wouldn't take a chance on buying a diamond on ebay. go to a reputible source where you'll get more details about the quality and maybe some insurance! take your money to a trusted company. and if you're going to spend in that range make it a smaller, higher quality diamond with a high quality metal.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	I don't like it, it's too much bulk to be comfortable to wear everyday.  I'd go for something with a bit less bulk, and if you want her to have a bit more bling get her a nice eternity band as a wedding band.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	I like it.  There is nothing tacky about diamonds, don't listen to the jealousy.  Just keep in mind if she has really small hands it would be a lot to lug around.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I think the middle stone is too big. Looks gaudy. But that's just me. If the band wasn't encrusted with more diamonds it probably wouldn't be so bad.|`|frA6KJwIaa	wow. that's a diamond!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I don't like it at all - too big and tacky for me. But if your fiance loves big diamonds go for it! It's just not my style.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	its gorgeous but good god what a price tag!<br>  if i knew my engagement ring cost that much i'd be afraid to wear it...|`|wRHhpanmaa	absolutely too big for my tastes, however, then again I like awkward jewelry.<br>  <br>  I however think she may find it too big. Why don't you propose to her first, then go and find a ring together? Or randomly go to a jewelry store in the mall when yall are out shopping and ask her (inconspicuously) what type of ring she likes.<br>  <br>  My husband bought me a big ring (although it wasn't that big, and didnt cost that much) and after i said yes, i asked if we could take it  back. I got a ring that costed under a hundred dollars, and must say, I absolutely love it. we had the stone in it replaced with a small diamond. <br>  <br>  so why not asking her, or waiting until yall can go out to choose a ring together? its not the ring that matters so much, but what it symbolizes, and the money that you save, thats more she can use when planning the wedding.|`|FzS3aphWaa	Everyone has different tastes which is why there are so many rings to choose from.  If your girlfriend has tried it on and likes it, that is all that matters.  Make sure that the store has an exchange policy just in case you have already bought it without her opinion so that she can choose one she likes|`|7WbehQZjaa	I think it's big and flashy. I'd be worried that someone would steal it. Just remember, not all women wear their engagement rings all their lives. Some, after having kids, take it off so that they don't scratch or hurt their kid.<br>  <br>  If you like it, can afford it, and think it's your spouse's style, than great job!!<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|1d9b99f89f201ac1200b561b07ae5d08aa	It's a bit much, price wise and diamond wise.  If your lady likes that kind of thing, well, go for it. But personally I'd freak out if my fiance had spent that much on a ring.  There's so much more that the money could go for, I'd honestly be disappointed.|`|TWwGN6Uzaa	I think if you're going to spend over $8K on a ring, you should see it in person.  You might not get such a huge diamond, but you'll have some peace of mind.|`|KpxVsPZSaa	its to bulky.<br>  yuk!|`|eK97o0wVaa	its a bit  much|`|aipChC3haa	gorgeous!<br>  I would KILL for that!<br>  How pretty =)<br>  Definatly get it for her|`|q3ulEHYAaa	WOW.. that's huge..my opinion its  to big.

Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hearts-and-kisses.com/marriage-counseling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hearts-and-kisses.com/marriag...</a>|`|2P2K0rl2aa	it will take a very long time to be able to move on from it, this is the very reason why cheating is taboo in relationships - the amount of hurt and damage it causes is immeasureable.<br>  <br>  Seek out other women who decided to stay with cheaters and see what they've got to say about it, they might be able to give you good advice.  Your friends and family, or a counsellor might also be able to help.<br>  <br>  Whether you will be able to live 'like you used to' is a bit touch and go.  He has severed the trust in the worst possible way, and even with a lot of help and forgiveness, things may never get back to the way they once were.|`|AA10861417	This happened to me, very similar.  I tried to stay in the marriage because he said he loved me.  But I would hear phrases and wonder he said it to her.    Bottom line.... A husband is supposed to be someone you can trust and depend on and love.   He broke your trust. he BROKE it.    It is EXTREMELY hard to rebuild.   I ended up in divorce.     You could try counseling, or separation.  But PLEASE know this is NOT your fault.  Do not feel guilty for wanting to leave.  He was deceptive.   I felt so much guilt - and stayed for too long afterwards.  If you feel you should go - do it.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	You need counseling only after you tell him why. I don't mean like drudging everything back so he can feel condemned but tell him what has been happening to you and what needs to be done in order for you to heal.|`|lckgvz2laa	You will never forget what happened. But if he is truly trying to rebuild the marriage then you should try not to dwell on the past. However! If he should do this again, you know it's time to move on. Good luck to you!|`|aDL7xmt6aa	For better or for worse?<br>  This may well be the worst of it and there are worse conditions.<br>  Think about it.|`|U2YK6lcJaa	Move on from him you deserve better|`|5EOLbVzQaa	Speaking from experience it sounds like you and your husband love each other very much and he has tried hard to make things right. if your husband is anything like mine his mistake already haunts him. he knows this is something that hurt you and it is a burden for him as much as for you. if you really love him let it go now and forgive him. be happy like you know you want to be and try not to dwell on the past.|`|7e8NN8saaa	First of all - the question really is do think he will do it again? Can you trust him? <br>  <br>  If the answer to this is no - then you need to end it - it won't get better because nothing has essentially ended. <br>  <br>  If the answer to this is yes - but you are obsessing over it then moving on is essential. The best thing to do is get some counseling. Your husband should know how much this hurt you and how much you need to heal in order for your marriage to be solid. There are things that you can do. <br>  <br>  It becomes essential to maybe go through another dating process and remember what it is that made you fall in love in the first place. How much is he willing to work at this?|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	You get up everyday and hope for the best.  That is what I am doing.  It has been seven months for me but it feels like yesterday.    <br>  This is a traumatic event that will forever be your canvas especially when you thought you had the perfect marriage. When you thought you had it all.  <br>  <br>  If your husband is truly remorseful and repentant that will make it little easier for you.<br>  <br>  Loving him makes you forgive him quite easily but forgetting will never come.  Hope that the love you share for each other will give you strength to face the future.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	You probably don't want advice from the other woman, but I want take a crack at it anyway. Do you love this man? And he has done the worse thing he could possibly do hasn't he? Well, just for your information he didn't say those same things to me.  Ironically, most of the time all he talked about was you. I made the decision to get involved with him a married man. I don't regret my decision.  He was loving, kind and helpful in more ways than one. I called our thing exactly what it was a fling. I never expected him to leave you for me and I knew this was not forever. Most men stray because there is something they are not getting at home. You weren't there. I am not giving him a pass to play. But I am saying sometimes things happen. I've been where you are and survived it. But I was not emotionally invested in your husband and he was not emotionally invested in me.  You have to ask yourself one question, "What would your life be like without him?" If you know in your heart its over then its over. If you would like to make it work, work on it give yourself some time. He should be willing to do whatever it takes to win your trust back. If he's not willing to do that, then you have your answer to whether or not you should stay.  I do wish you Good Luck.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Marriage is about honesty and trust.  My husband could be in a room with naked women and he would just talk to them normal and move on.  Your husband broke the trust... he commited adultery.  You need to move on.  If he cheated once, he will do it again.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	oh don't kid yourself toots. he's cheating again.  he's just not as dumb and is more careful with those IM logs.|`|T22OjCMRaa	I am in the same situation you are. It's been over a year now and I still think about what my husband did everyday. I can't get some of the things that he said (when he was explaining himself) about her and the situation out of my head! It's like a bad nightmare that I can't wake up from! So I think what you should do is ask him and yourself if you two are strong enough to make it through the long struggle ahead! Because it takes years, even with counseling. You may not even be able to EVER get over it. The trust is gone, end of story!<br>  <br>  PS - AKA04D, the person who gave the answer above me, you are very pathetic and what people call a "homewrecker." I can't wait until your husband cheats on you. Making stupid statements like, "he wasn't getting what he needed at home" is crap and everyone knows it. Get a life!|`|lN5d688gaa	i'm sorry but you really never forget.  the best damn thing for me was to forget about him and move on.  it's not your problem that you can't move on.  it was his fault that he cheated.  remember that.  you didn't make him cheat.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	sad truth is you will never forget.  i think you are probably still young, move on and find someone you can trust.

nbtxSkIDaa	I guess my first question would be how old are you?<br>  My parents were beyond overprotective of me for FOREVER. My mom freaked out when I first got a myspace, and she deleted it, which made me really mad. My dad didn't care as much...he was more like "Just don't post anything you wouldn't want everybody knowing." I understand that your mom is trying to protect you, but she needs to understand that you're getting older. Because your parents split, do you think that maybe your mom is just disagreeing with your dad just to disagree with him? I don't know the situation, so I can't say much. <br>      No, I don't think you're overreacting. I think a lot of it may have to do with age (depending on how old you are). I'll be 19 soon, and my parents just let the leash considerably looser when I turned 18 a while back. Ehh...blocking out the viruses? I think he's just doing what your mom asked him to do about blocking Facebook. Every website anymore could possibly have a virus, you just need good virus protectors on your computer. <br>     I think you need to sit down with your mom and genuinely ask her what her deal is, why she's being so over protective, and why do some of the rules that apply to you don't apply to your brother (i.e. the Facebook thing)|`|E4hJeq4eaa	some parents are just very over protective and i dont think its really over reacting, but just try to talk to him about it some more. <br>  show them that you are responsible and you can handle being safe and things like that.|`|57XKYEEKaa	Tell your mom just what you told us. My mom blocked my computer and I told her how I felt and she unblocked it. Best Wishes|`|65m62rDraa	You are overreacting big time! Your mother and your uncle are there to protect you. Sometimes while you are growing up things do not seem as harmful as they might really be. Your father might not be as careful about it because you are not his responsibility 24/7. <br>  My kids (14&15) don't always agree with my rules and decisions because it doesn't allow them to do some of the things they want to do. When they|`|Wz1O9m53aa	You really can't do anything about who your mom seeks advice from it's her decision. You can however demonstrate that you are smart.Look at these reasons he gives logically figure out how you can avoid the problems. Say like, I know my identity could be stolen but I plan to protect myself from that by only listing very general info. I don't plan to put truly personal information on there". Your Uncle sounds like a know it all so say things to him like,Thanks Uncle Up-in-my-business,<br>  I did'nt know facebook was soooo dangerous now that you've pointed out. I'll know to protect myself."
mMi19s7Vaa	well you could talk to her <br>  since she is young<br>  you could maybe till her that her daddy wouldn't want her to act like that<br>  <br>  and that daddy is in a better place and he is looking down at her everyday and......<br>  someday she will see him again =]|`|5I01tsgYaa	If she's 4 and she lost her father 3 years ago, she honestly shouldn't even remember him.|`|ZFwC23mqaa	It's obvious that there are issues to the child's bad behaviour other than the loss of her father, she will not remember him.<br>  Perhaps the attention she has recieved because of the loss has resulted in her becoming spoilt?<br>  Really, a councillor should be able to source the roots of the problem which is obviously not grief.|`|FYR9nQjdaa	She might have had a bad experience after her father did which influenced her personality. If her mom doesn't care about her, then she needs a new home.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	there really should not be anything to deal with. If she was only 1 year old, then there is no way she remembers anything about him. Maybe she is just an angry person?|`|QilfSBfsaa	She had no pain by the time her father died as she was only 1yr old, but he does need someone loves her and play with her.|`|E4hJeq4eaa	thats horrible. <br>  i dont really know what else you can do though.<br>  good luck.

That would be so cool!|`|gMb8YFiEaa	Take her on the swan boat rides in the park! Or go to the top of the john hancock building.
8807432e73f1c388fc872615460a2996aa	It's possible that your parents are under some sort of pressure and stresses at the moment and this can make normally loving parents suddenly become short fused and have them over reacting at things that would normally be easy for them to handle.<br>  <br>  That's not to say you should accept being insulted and maybe you could tell your Dad that you know you're over weight right now and trying to do something about it but he is upsetting you when he talks like that.<br>  <br>  Try to speak to your Mum and tell her you feel like things aren't right or the same at home and you're worried. She might be able to put your mind at rest.<br>  <br>  Above all, try and go out once in a while with some friends and have some fun .. maybe the weekends.<br>  <br>  Worries are for grown ups and your parents will come through what ever it is .... carry on being the good daughter you are but mix with your friends.<br>  <br>  Take care

4lL34wJnaa	Tell him for your anniversary that the two of you are purchasing wedding bands.  You need to tell him exactly what you want and give him suggestions as to what he should get.  Price them out.  This way he has a few months to get the money together to buy your wedding band at least.|`|ehAG30Yvaa	You're already married so what incentive does he have to buy you a ring? You should have insisted that he get you a ring before getting married if it was that important to you. You don't need a ring to be happily married but it's obviously bothering you that he didn't get you one and has since spent money on other things that he could have put towards a ring for you. Tell him how you feel and tell him that you want to go and pick out a ring. If he can't afford to buy one right now, get a line of credit through the jewelry store or a credit card specifically for this purchase. As much as it would be nice for him to come home one day and surprise you with a ring it doesn't sound like that's going to happen. A little hand holding might be necessary to get what you want.|`|Jy6dFXjVaa	Honey, not all wedding bands cost a fortune. Sometimes, when times are tough like they are now, it might be prudent to wait on buying an engagement ring so you don't put yourselves in debt. But before your husband got a phone and considering you've been married eight months, I'd give him until your first anniversary to cough up a wedding band. If he can afford a dammm phone for himself, then he can certainly afford to purchase a simple wedding band for you. Start telling your husband outright that you really would like a nice wedding band for your first anniversary gift! You can always get a nicer, more expensive wedding ring set at a later date when the economy is doing a little better. But I'm sticking with your first anniversary as an answer for a wedding band.|`|BObu4i9saa	if it was the engagement ring i wouldn't worry about it but you should at least get a band - it's not like they are expencive<br>  i'd go out and find one you like and say, "hunny i want this one"<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  don't nag|`|hsZnjZvoaa	First, you're not a fool - either it's not something he is consciously thinking about or he is waiting for a special occasion. <br>  <br>  Since you're married, if he did not have one for you at the ceremony, go buy yourself one.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i dont know what was spent on my engagement ring... he wont tell me<br>  but my wedding band only cost us $130 and there are cheaper ones out there... <br>  get on ebay, you can buy a ring for like $20. as if he cant afford that!|`|wRHhpanmaa	It is not the ring so much, but what the ring represents. <br>  <br>  Hint to him that perhaps you may want a ring, or tell him (and this always works) that some guy flirted with you, and you told him you were married, but he didnt believe you because you didnt have a ring<br>  and if that doesnt work<br>  <br>  Talk to him about getting you a ring, and if he says he can't afford it right now, pick out a cheap pretty ring online somewhere that you like (i mean like cubic zirconia or perhaps another inexpesive stone) and ask him to buy it. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you are really looking for that token of his love, and that symbol that tells people that you are married. <br>  <br>  a cheap ring would do well until he has he money to afford a large one. My ring costed under a hudred dollars. and although it isnt a typical engagement/wedding ring, it symbolizes something special.|`|o503YPrqaa	Rings are resonably priced. But also can be expensive.

Helzberg Diamonds has great deals. My ring is an Amethyst. Link in Source.  I love it. And my man's wedding band will be around 200$, and my wedding band is like  200-400 dollars. Not sure which one I want yet. Wedding is 1 year away. =) Anyway yeah just ask him. Maybe wait till the 1 year anniversary.

I am sure it will not be long however, if most girls are taken, then other single girls you don't know about will feel compelled to find a guy as well. If you make it known that you are single, you may just find that a lot of girls come your way!<br>  <br>  Girls have a big fear of rejection, even bigger than boys, so they tend not to try anything if there is a risk that their "target" has a gf. So make sure people know you're single!|`|jU2fhTCFaa	my advice is stay friends with these girls who have bf's. There's no harm in that. They might have single friends.

Keep talking these girls.  IF something happens, and this girl becomes single, then you might start dating.  BUT Don't wait around for these girls... which brings me to number 2.)  Start talking to as many girls as possible.  That doesn't mean be a player BUT make as many friends with girls as possible... that way your attention isn't focused on one girl AND girls have many girlfriends.... so if you get really friendly with them... you can ask them if they have any single friends to hook you up with?

Bq8L7iT4aa	Your grandma prob has nothing to yell at you about. she's just taking the her anger with your mom out on you. If you have close friends, try staying over their house for a night or more, just to get away from the warzone long enough to get your thoughts straight. In addition, said friend will probably give you the comfort you need.<br>  <br>  It does suck to be 14. I used to be like you, but some deep survival instinct brought me back from the brink of self-annihilation. just hang in there long enough.
JhvqUvlsaa	No you do not have to be friends with someone like that; you can do better and find someone who will treat you with respect.  I would ask him to stop bagging you and treating you like dirt; if he doesn't listen say you can't be friends with someone who behaves that way. If he still doesn't get it then find new friends. <br>  <br>  Good luck
EaurpLufaa	Be yourself.  Part of being mature is being yourself.  If an older woman sees that you are confident in who you are, you will most likely be a candidate for the taking.
Uj5kuzoJaa	I've never heard of not liking a guy because he knows how to fish. As long as he doesn't do it in excess and make me feel like he's always leaving, I like that a guy has a hobby. It gives me some time to myself as well to do my own thing. It's good to have some things that you like to do by yourself or with your friends. Not to mention, I personally enjoy fishing, even if I don't fish i just bring a book along and have some peace and quiet with my guy. It's enjoyable|`|tGcNmDUZaa	I wouldn't find a guy that fished unattractive unless he smelt or something. But maybe I'm not really a fair case - I grew up in Zimbabwe and went fishing a lot so I can see the attraction to it.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Yes, the can't understand fishing.  I find that once they go with you, find the relaxation ....they come around.|`|AU3HVTToaa	no|`|1nJFqRceaa	whats up man, in my experience, since i am a good ol southern country boy, the gals around here love a man that gets out in nature and does things like fish.  a real man will get out and enjoy nature.  man i will tell you this though.  if you ever find you a gal that does not like you because you fish...ta hell wid her....if you love fishing and she doesnt ol well.  dont ever let someone come between you and what you love to do.  fishing was there for you before you were born, fishing was there when you started to walk and fishing was there when you first picked up a rod.  dont you ever put down that rod for some ol' gal.  just like the good ol saying, there are many fish in the sea.  or pond, or lake or river, what ever you fish.  <br>  <br>  I am happlied married and my wife likes to fish so i got lucky on that but one day while we were just dating she asked me what if she made me choose between her and fishing, the look i gave her answered it all for her.<br>  <br>  there has been many times in my life that i just didnt want to hold on anymore and i thought that my world would be better if my life came to an end.  there has been times that i thought that i couldnt take another step...but i can tell you this one thing.  when i could not hold any more i found the life in me to grab ahold to a reel and sit on a bank or float down the river.  mother nature and fishing fixed my world for me.  for a little while anyways but everytime that i needed help.  the water the fish the trees and mother nature was there to help me out.<br>  <br>  i didnt want to leave all this to ya but it is something to think about.  fishing is more than a sport or an activity, it is a way of life and it is an experience.  <br>  <br>  so dont let a gal make you turn your head at fishing<br>  <br>  hope that helps you out a bit good luck good fishin be safe and rememeber to share the experience|`|JOVWBOOCaa	No!! Not as long as they take me with them! (okay fine atleast SOMETIMES take me with them!) = ) I would find a man who has pink hair unattractive, or a man who doesn't shower unattractive, maybe someone rude or mean unattractive. I find drug abusers, and woman abusers unattractive but fishing? I don't see how a hobby (unless it is harmful) can make someone unattractive! A female who doesn't except a man the way he is is unattractive and you shouldn't worry about them anyway!|`|64MfLpwCaa	Well 1st thing man, Women love guys who fish an hang out at rivers ponds etc... Me n my Bro do it every weekend an women are always coming down an hanging with us at the river or a pond whatever it is cuz its fun relaxing, Dont think they dont like it, jus have fun wit it.|`|ca0f5a47cf09cbd5e44eadcb861c8819aa	I like men that goes fishing, i like fishing but don't know how to do it too well.

Even when I did eat meat I hated fish anyways. I find the smell really gross and I don't like looking at dead fish. So I found a nice Veggie guy and wouldn't want to date a meat eater unless he was opened minded. I prefer the veggies though. You should turn veggie.

874EAxkfaa	marriage is for responsible, mature people,not selfish 28yr old little boys. you, my dear, have three children to tend to. you and spouse should seek help of a marriage counselor. somebody has to put some effort into this group, and make it a family.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	You both need to sit down and talk some more! he is really going out a lot! it's almost every day! and he and you have 2 kids, it's time to grow up!  he needs to take responsibility of these children, There is nothing wrong with having fun, you both, but every day why does he do it!

040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	He needs counseling but you may have to leave to get him to go for that.  You can get some support perhaps at ncadv.org and you can talk to a chaplain on his base perhaps.  You are right not to want to raise your daughter this way because she may learn from you and accept the same mistreatment from a future husband!!|`|IrquK9N6aa	<a href="http://www.iraqwarveterans.org/ptsd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iraqwarveterans.org/ptsd.htm</a><br>  <br>  Try this once and see if you can get some ideas on what to do.|`|0tusTThyaa	PTSD. And he will probably refuse treatment for it. Try and get some articles together about it and leave it out for him to see. <br>  <br>  MANY MANY MANY of our military members return from Iraq/Afghan with PTSD. And it is hard on a relationship. If he won't go to counseling with you, you can still go by yourself. You will need the direction of a counselor on how to deal and help your DH return to a normal society. One in which he didn't have to fear for his life or others lives.<br>  <br>  I understand what you are feeling. Stop for a minute and think about what your husband has seen and done overseas...? I am sure there are things he cannot talk with you about. I know that is how it is, I am submarinarer's wife. I don't know what job he had over there. But anger is a BIG thing he has come back with.<br>  <br>  You married this man and had a baby with him. While I understand that he is NOT OK right now, he needs you more than anything, prolly more than he is willing to admit. This does not mean that he should treat you like a doormat.<br>  <br>  Counseling!<br>  <br>  Look for a YAHOO group for Army wives. I have a group for SUB WIVES, and we are all over the US. Just go to yahoo, left hand side, look for groups, click it. Then search army wives. Join one, there will be lots of help and encouragment for you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't leave. Would you want him to leave you if the roles were reversed?|`|AA12244948	Even though he insists he doesn't need help, he does. Being over there, I've heard so many stories of men coming back completely changed and it's like they have no emotion anymore. Nothing seems to surprise them after that.<br>  <br>  Try counseling first and if he doesn't appear to changing, perhaps take a break. Stay with a friend and see if that finally gives him the push he needs to wake up and realize what is wrong in the marriage. You're a good mother for not wanting your daughter to grow up in a home full of fighting.|`|kqcQw4m4aa	I can't imagine how stressful and diffcult it must be to be a millitary wife with a baby.  My heart goes out to you.  But I do think you should stay with your husband.  I think he may have changed after being in Iraq for that long and been through God knows what while there.  Perhaps he needs some time to come around. From one woman to another I will tell you that in my life I've learned to find out who I am and make my life fun and interesting without needing my husband to do that for me all the time.  I know it's tough but you can do it.  My husband is not in the millitary, but he is a very independent man that had always needed his time and space.  I have learned that if you give them their space and not nag at them about things, they start to feel like being friends again, then lovers again and so on.  If you thought your husband was shut down, he will shut down even more if your always winey and dependent on him to make you happy and complete you.  His resources are probably spent right now.  You may have to put yourself together and make yourself happy without his help.  When A man sees that, he will want to get close to you.  I know you give a lot and sacrifice a lot too.  Women work really hard, I guess it's part of being a mom and wife.  When I tried that my husband pulled a 380.  It's important to take time to be alone and do things for yourself.  Like treat yourself to a movie and buy yourself popcorn and just breathe.  Or go to a bookstore and buy yourself a warm cup of coffee and read a good book or magazine.  Take walks, exercize that always helps your mood.  Just find fun things to do for yourself.  I used to be a very unhappy wife with many legitimate complaints and drew my husband away even more.  Now I don't take things too seriously. I have fun and take may boys to the mall and do little things that are fun.  Anyway, good luck! Oh I recommend the book "The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands" and remember you made a vow that you would be there for better or for worse.  That is a holy vow in the eyes of God.  You can do it! : )|`|monjkLfEaa	Ok girl! I am a 32 year women! My hubby has been in Iraqu as well! I realized that he wasn't the same anymore eather! Well I thougth I give him the time that he needs!

He has willingly offered to protect us as a country and he probably has been through hell and back.   <br>  <br>  Rather than concentrate on what you've missed out on, think about him and support him in his role.  It won't be easy but over time he'll begin to see how wonderful you are.  You're right you need emotional support too but it has to start with someone.  Obviously it won't be him so it has to be you.  Your daughter deserves a mom and dad that love each other.  That's the best thing you can give her right now.<br>  <br>  Also, there has to be some kind of support group for military families.  I'd start there first.  Good luck!|`|AA11693263	Go see the movie "Fireproof" and then go buy a book called "The Love Dare". Like the book says, if you are willing to take this "dare" and follow through with it the entire 40 days and don't skip any of the challenges, then you, you marriage and your husband can go through some wonderful changes. And if he won't watch the movie with you, that's okay. You watch it and get the book and you don't even need to tell him that you are doing the things from the book. Changes won't happen over night and some of the Dares can be pretty hard to follow through with. The book cost me just under $11.00 at Wal-mart and was one of the best purchases I have ever made.

And he is just making generalisations, which test his own trust.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	first off let me say you are in no way the first person to feel this way after a deployment.   it really sounds like your hubby has some symptoms of ptsd.  my hubby came back from afghanistan and was a little different, he also refused to see anybody about it.  his issues weren't that bad (the sound of bagpipes-from ramp ceremonies really sets him off, and he gets angry quicker than ever before)  his fear is that if he were to talk to someone (for free as the military pays for it) would be that it would go on his record.   your hubby may feel the same way.    i know you feel desperate and need out, but i suggest that you try a few things first.  a.  go to a therapist yourself.  i was also miserable when my hubby came home, and after talking it out i felt so much better.  b. think of the best interest of your daughter.  i know you have to do what makes you happy but it might be worth trying to work things out with her daddy.  c. read 'the love dare'  it was an extremly great book and helped me put things into perspective.     i would also suggest talking with other wives/gf's of guys he was deployed with. this may help bring some light to the situation if other guys opened up and talked to them about.   i have found a lot of help from the MFRC or other family resource centre, depending where you are.      i hope things are able to work out.  and i wish you the best of luck.|`|cb76b5cf2e273e704d7f31195504dc33aa	Your husband sounds like he has unresolved issues from the deployment. It's VERY VERY common to have reacclimation issues when your hubby comes home from a deployment, but if he's still having anger issues, seems emotionally distant and irritated then he NEEDS to talk to someone who will understand what he may be going through.

55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	They don't pay .... But the Fed and State will help pay for the children to get a good education ... Ya can't get blood from a rock ... to the agency's work on getting the kids the best education in the healthiest environment possible.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	I was told by a social worker that they are supposed to contribute some form of child support, whether cash or "in kind" (meaning clothes, diapers, food items, etc.)  However, when she told me this and gave me a package of diapers that the parent had supplied, it was the first I'd heard of it; for several months, the parent supplied absolutely nothing until right before a court date, when the parent suddenly bought some clothes for the children.  (And thus it would seem that it was done to make an impression on the court.)<br>  <br>  But this isn't done if the parent's rights are terminated, if they no longer have parental rights.  And they don't force the parents to pay, they just record the fact of whether they are or not (and speak of it to the judge in court where it may or may not influence the judge's decisions).  <br>  <br>  Mostly, taxpayers support these children.  And the system tries to make sure that the children get a decent education so that they aren't a burden to the taxpayers forever...|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Scott free-we pay with our taxes!|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Hopefully, they're getting rehabilitation.  But yes I do believe they get off scott free.  Fortunately, there are taxpayers whose money is allotted for these programs.  I agree they should have to pay, maybe Obama has something up his sleeve for this issue too.|`|8dbdaa41e161ab849eed90e5dcce161daa	Nope.
CxRJwJsraa	Age might be the thing.<br>  <br>  I know many younger girls who just plain don't get that the nice guys are where it's at. Usually they want a guy that is a bit mysterious and sexy...but nothing is sexier than a guy you can tell all your secrets too.<br>  <br>  Your time will come.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Well, you sound a great friend..............|`|VtWy0pDwaa	well if you'd like you not just a good guy friend to me. you need to let them know that you available, let them know your not just there to be a good listener or a good friend,let them know that sometimes you want to be more than friends...................... it's ok.|`|EHVGbev6aa	Um. .  Don't date youger girls because people will look at you different.. You need to just keep doing what you are doing because you will find someone!|`|ULyXPuvKaa	i'm having the same problem i don't want t be the stereotypical gu and that has  gotten me screwed over so many times. i tried out one of my friends as a gf once and that was the biggest mistake ever but only cuz shes not my type. what you should do is just start out by giving them compliments and stuff that will not keep them as a friend (it's all or nothing basically.) you have to be a little more assertive and let them know that you are more than JUST a  friend. hope i helped|`|kFcdwVwdaa	hey bro, i was the same way. i still am. girls confide in me a lot and i hated it. well if you date younger girls, that shouldn't be a problem. like someone else said, tell them you are interested in more than just friends. that you are attracted to them physically, emotionally, and spiritually, or whatever works for you and that you would like for them to feel the same for you. sometimes you just have to talk more and dont listen as much. you are probably a good listener so they like that but sometimes you have to put yourself out there. make yourself dateable.
GutSmU4Oaa	this happend to my friend.<br>  One of her guy friends told her that he liked her but she just wanted to be friends.<br>  i would feel apercated that someone felt that way about me but if i didn't want to screw up our friendship i would just stay friends with the guy.<br>  *hope this helped in some way*|`|a1iam8Zvaa	this just happend to me<br>  and i wasnt happy<br>  i loved talking to him and he was a good friend<br>  and now its all ruined =/<br>  BEFORE you tell this girl you like ehr ask her friend if she likes you<br>  do that before you ruin the friendship|`|O7xYvttsaa	i think you should find out if she likes you before you ask her out, or tell her you like her, or w/e. cuz if she doesn't, it could make things really akward...|`|MviD8Oy4aa	And i didn't like him back? I would feel a little awkward at first. but i would be complimented (can't think of the right word, besides honored) and everything would eventually go back to normal. I would tell him that we would be better off and friends, and that i wasn't willing to risk the friendship with him.|`|qcvjUgHzaa	Well it depends... how close are you? Are you like best best friends? She might say something like "I don't want to ruin our friendship."<br>  <br>  Be prepared for that, but I say GO FOR IT! Even if she doesn't feel the same way, at least you know now.|`|HjlTfH7aaa	idk|`|qxuI7RvUaa	well......idk...thats a tough one.  I would probably from then on, feel awkward around him.|`|3tIiulsNaa	just talk to her a little more and get to know her. just invite her out somewhere and tell her u like her and see how she reacts. I can almost guarantee she'll like you or grow to like you. when someone likes you you cant help but like them back even a little bit|`|yKUq4zNXaa	It all depends on the person, like if it was a close friend, then I might have feelings for them as well. But if it's JUST a friend, then I wouldn't make things anymore awkward then they needed to be.|`|fb72c03f708d5bcf85c1a359793d07b1aa	if he's just a friend to me, i would just tell him what I really feel about him. I would say that I'm not interested in having a relationship right now. But it will feel kind of awkward talking to him afterwards.|`|VJP1zL4uaa	ive had that happen.<br>  <br>  and i didnt really like the guy but we began to keep talking bout a relationship and eventually it happened. just dont press it and put pressure on it|`|y03b6F1Baa	I guess, I would be surprised or something of the sort.<br>   If your not close friends I would suggest that you try getting to know her a little better or maybe hint out that you like her.|`|cF5ujdVEaa	It feel sorta wierd and unexpected..but it would depend if I liked you back ofcourse!|`|JsSM50ZWaa	i'd feel kinda special. Because my friend chose ME to like ME!<br>  And I'd feel happy. And that this friend is really honest and he cares about me a lot.|`|8CfsAnvNaa	okay, well i think you should tell the girl.<br>  if she was a true friend it wouldnt matter if she like you or not.<br>  its a good thing fi she likes you and if not you two can be really good friends.<br>  sometimes girls are mean and they dont want to be guys friends anymore if they find out that guy lies them whcih is stupid and shes not woirth your time if shes one of tehose girls, andif shes not thats good your a couple now(:<br>  good luck, hope thsi helps.|`|KWbFTPnkaa	awkward. i'd try to make him feel like everything was normal, but it would make me go crazy to try to make him feel like everything was the same as it was before. don't ruin a good friendship, wait a little longer, and maybe she'll come around (:<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|l7jnTlD3aa	I would definitly say awww that is so sweet but i just like someone else.
492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	He likes you.|`|3vmDRCTCaa	Maybe he dislikes you, or maybe he's just a bit immature and actually likes you. Just smile and be as friendly as possible without being fake. Try to keep your ideas on the down low until you get to class. You could just ask him his name or something if you feel like it. Otherwise, just seem approachable and maybe he'll let you know what his issue is eventually. You might not want to approach him as abrasively (e.g. "You freak me out") as that first poster suggested. He might be alone or something and some people go crazy and shoot up colleges because they feel isolated. He might just need a friend or something. Or maybe he knows you from another friend, heard a rumor, or something. It's hard to tell about these kinds of things.|`|aGEESfIUaa	Sounds like just your plain-jane, run of the mill weird guy.<br>  <br>  You have ultimately two choices,<br>  <br>  1.) Avoid him.<br>  2.) Confront him.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest confronting him, let him know that he freaks you out and you'd prefer he stopped.  Just watch out in case he's a real whackjob and decides to stalk you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
jfsul7ENaa	don't hide the baby. Love your girlfriend the way she is.|`|ixR3qfYdaa	You need to embrace your child that is in her womb. When the baby comes out are you going to say, hey hide the baby somebody's coming over? That is YOUR baby too. If my bf told me to hide my pregnant stomach I would be so hurt, especially with the raging hormones!!!|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Deal with her showing.  She's pregnant, she's going to show.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	well, she is probably thinking that you are ashamed of her and the baby or you dont want to take responsibility.<br>  <br>  why are you asking her to hide the baby?<br>  if you have a good reason maybe you should talk to her and tell her why you still dont want people to know yet.<br>  <br>  but any girl would want her bf to be supportive and proud.|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	You say you love her, but are ashamed that you got her pregnant?  Some man you are.<br>  <br>  Suck it up.  You got her pregnant, so it's time to deal with it.  Real men take responsibility for their problems and deal with it head on.  Well, she can't hide her pregnancy forever, and you basically just told her you are ashamed to be with her now that she's starting to show.  That's a really great way to show a girl you love her.<br>  <br>  Be a man, and show her that you really love her by not caring that she's showing.
6c77928b771d6a7239a325d3a698e58faa	some people have trouble opening up in person and are much more friendly online. I had a friend who would talk to me like we were best friends online but not even smile at me at school. He probably doesn't know how you view the relationship and whether or not you view him as a friend, an acquaintance, or something more and doesn't know how to react when he sees you. He also may be in a different group of friends and intimidated by the group you hang out with. Try saying hi first and see what happens. It's likely that he's just shy|`|BO28Mn8haa	next time he's on facebook just ask him whats up and end your confusion!|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	tht bcuz he want you to talk to him|`|E84iCYH2aa	Hez just not that into you ;)|`|hTT8DhYfaa	um... maybe he found somebody else.... or, he's just confused lol<br>  <br>  good luck|`|mRGfLpwyaa	he wants you|`|mRZ6Z1O3aa	Seems to me like he's messing with your head.<br>  Talk to him and try and get him to listen up real good.<br>  You can't be depressed over someone who might like you too.<br>  Relax and try and find out if he likes you too or not. try writing him a little letter,maybe than he'll feel open,because you were open too.|`|6JLIMmWYaa	Sounds to me that he is no interested :(  Or he changed is mind for some reason.  If he asked to hang out and you agreed, then he would have shown up if he were interested.  The hard part was out of the way.|`|0xO8Y98uaa	Aww, your avatar makes me wanna cry, too!<br>  <br>  It's possible he's thinking the same thing you are.  He sees you walk by without a word.  Try striking up a conversation with him yourself.  If he's not receptive, he might just be shy.|`|SIErQrtnaa	i think he likes you and doesnt think u like him or something maybe u talk to him and if he trys to leave say wait im talking or something <br>  k will some people please answer mine at <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309120012AAA1VBt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	I agree with Foxy!

From what you have said both seem like they could be right.<br>  <br>  First, he may be shy and doesn't know what to say now that he said you should hang out.<br>  <br>  Second, he could have just been acting nice while you were online talking.<br>  <br>  Either way, there will be no harm in pursuing it if you are interested.  He hasn't done anything to show he's not interested in at least some type of friendship.|`|WUzUcebkaa	he likes u|`|0FTO1lBsaa	Either he is shy and not confident to talk face to face, or doesn't want anyone else to know or be seen with you.
wovoZ5Z0aa	He can only use you for sex, if you let him.  If he sticks around without sex, he's there for you and not for the sex.  <br>  <br>  If he's sexually active, he is not likely to stop because you're NOT sleeping with him.  If he's abstinent now, he'll probably stay that way.  Why don't you ask him about it.
pOmjcVjZaa	I totally feel your pain, something similar happened to me.<br>  Actually, it will be way better off if he ignores you;<br>  it won't be as painful. Trust me. I wish my ex would ignore me.<br>  My advice to get over him:<br>  -Don't ever think about him (I know it sounds hard, but I works)<br>  -Try to find someone else, not to make him jealous, but to help you get over him<br>  -Try not to go in any direction where he could be (which should be pretty easy as long as he's not in any of your classes or anything)<br>  -DON'T hurt yourself in any way; it makes the mental pain worse (trust me)<br>  -DON'T resort to drugs/alcohol/etc; it won't turn out good<br>  -And most importantly, try to have fun with friends and family, and remember that they love you and don't like to see you sad.<br>  <br>  I know it's going to be hard, but I truely hope you get over him.<br>  [And if you do get over him, he'll probably talk to you again; guys are like that]|`|v8Xr0Mn9aa	bump that. don't beg for nobody's attention.if he doesn't want to be your friend to hell with him. you're not needy. there are billions of people in the world- why are you groveling over this clown? if he doesn't want to be your friend he's doing you a favor.you came in this world without him and you're going to leave out of it without him. in the meantime  LIVE! i bet you he's not thinking about you so why are you contemplating about him. he's moved on with his life and you need to do the same.|`|94c983eed26f9fffeb52827bce2a933baa	If he said he wants to be enemies he sorta sounds a little bit  mean and violent and i suggest find someone elese and forget this bum he isnt worth it beleive me.|`|pEfEOuu9aa	omg girl leave his a** alone before he goes crazy on you he obviously hes moving on so you should to find a new friend ..|`|e3NwYCkhaa	If he makes you feel sad, and ignores you. hes most definitely not worth any of your time. It's going to take time to get over it and there is not a specific way to do it. Just have fun and don't get hung up over the past, its not comming back for a reason.

See if she is warmer to you than shes been before. If she is, you might be getting closer to what you want. Don't chat too long tho, even if you want, before you leave, ask her if she would like to get together for coffee, lunch, or dinner.<br>  <br>  Try to make it as much of date as you possibly can. And make sure she has as much fun as possible!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Yeah play it cool, can't fault you for being busy.  Chicks love it when dudes act like they don't give a sh!t about them, it's like crack to them.|`|qs9QHvy9aa	From her message, I'd say your already in the "friend zone", and ignoring her is only making her think that your mad at her.

Maybe shes got a hot friend for ya.|`|HRJDrnBRaa	Stop being a puss-y and just get to the point with her. Tell het you like her.

Resume being available and hanging out, and then say (soon) "Hey, we seem to get along great. Would you consider dating me?" I mean it doesn't happen magically, you have to ask. But playing hard to get is just going to tick her off and then you will have no chance at all.<br>  <br>  So go ahead, tell her you were busy, but don't do this any more.|`|6zmRI4QAaa	I think you should go out to lunch. Or just go out somewhere and talk, tell her how you feel.<br>  <br>  I think people over complicate the whole dating thing too much and try to "play by the rules". Just dive in and let yourself go, what's the worst that can happen? She'll say no. So you get over with your life and move on.<br>  <br>  There's plenty of fish in the sea, the next one even better than the last. <br>  <br>  It's spring time! Get out there and do something FUN!|`|Z9llKxssaa	You should go see her today with some flowers and chocolate.  Chocolate = sex, flowers = I'm sensitive and care.  Don't text her though, just show up at her work.  Also, be sure you tell her that you don't wanna be friends if there isn't sex involved, starting tonight.  Although dating is fun, being "friends with benefits" is waaaay more exciting and worth your time.|`|6JrCDCtuaa	are you trying to just shun her from your life forever, or are you trying to be more than friends?<br>  <br>  if you're trying to not be her friend, just tell her.<br>  <br>  if you want to be more than friends, talk to her about it because you are sending her mixed signals.|`|eMSP740Taa	I think you def. have the right idea.

Have the two of you talked about either one of you relationship status? If not maybe you should casually talk about it one time. If you feel confident enough ask her to dinner. If she feels like you are mad at her or uninterested she will pull away. Good Luck!|`|a8JdS1HEaa	some of thee best relationships start out as friendship <br>  i don't see whats so wrong about having a friendship with <br>  this gal & by not keeping in touch she might think your<br>  not interested, so playing the dating game is not good <br>  advice when your thinking she might be someone special <br>  <br>  personally when i meet a guy & i just want to stay in a <br>  friend zone i will compare him to my brother & thats a pretty <br>  clear sign i dont think this will happend to you since she is <br>  referring to you as Hun  & concerned with you being mad or <br>  not <br>  <br>  well anyways hope this helped best of luck =]
AA10890553	He's just a bit scared I think. He might fancy you a bit, in which case he probably doesn't want to send the wrong thing in case you think badly of him. He sounds lovely though.|`|j7899jcdaa	Here are a couple of scenarios of what I "think."<br>  1. He really didn't have any songs that he wrote, or had something and is not finished.  So yeah, maybe he lied.<br>  2. You may have sounded too eager after he asked you the question, and based on your response... he may have been turned off.  Even though you really like him, you shouldn't let him know too much too early.  Let him chase you first for a bit.<br>  3.  If he does have some songs, maybe it is about you or another touchy subject.  In which he realizes that he maybe a bit too embarrassed to show anyone now.<br>  <br>  If you are still interested in the "songs," wait a few more days to ask him.  But just say/ask something like this, "So are ya gonna let me read those songs or did ya change your mind?"  If he says "I don't know" or No.  You can say "Ok...whatever."  And try to notice his reaction.|`|cQ22MEU6aa	Sounds like he is nervous and he really wants you to like what he has written.  After all he is pouring pieces of his heart out on paper.  For him to even ask you was probably a really big step.  Just be patient and don't bring it up anymore.  He will come around.  He is getting up his gumption to send them.  You never know how long it took him to ask you the first time. Just breath.  Does he know how you feel about him?  Maybe it's time to tell him.|`|63GLryA3aa	hey there,i thinkl you should move on.the biggest thing is that he asked someone about you.they either don't like you or said something bad,because of jealousy.you can ask him,directly.check it out!he wasn't scared of you,but, he was scared away by some jerk.|`|07L1TwNraa	Yeah I could almost guarantee you that if these songs exist, he showed them to someone else first because he likes you, and they didn't like them.

The fact that you inquired is probably enough.  Now, sit back and wait ... you have expressed interest and opened the door.  Good work.|`|677e3e2637ad1f4e65b4ede3bec9ff93aa	well if you listened to the songs there might be something in them that would suprise you|`|MnewrjTAaa	Ah, he's nervous.  You like him, he likes you ... take it to the next level!  Ask him to go for coffee or a beer or whatever you kids do at the student union these days.<br>  <br>  But don't mention the songs again.  He might have decided they weren't good or maybe he just planned on writing them and then kind of couldn't get it to work.  If you ask again he will feel lame.<br>  <br>  Really!  Do it!  I found out FIFTEEN YEARS LATER that the boy I liked freshman year liked me back!  Argh!  We were both just too shy.  (He hunted me down from out of state and emailed me.)|`|dthpLcVbaa	Maybe his buddies told him his song sucked, and now he is too self-conscious to share? There are quite a lot of possibilities... so try not to read too much into it. <br>  <br>  What's more important is.. If he still likes you, he will try a different approach. If he doesnt, his lose of interest will be obvious. Don't let it bother you too much. ;-)|`|pjggSVKKaa	i think he may have found someone else not to be mean or anything but it sounds like it act cool still friendly but still like u av totally 4gotten about the music|`|2Sbq3JNbaa	He is nervous.

I mean you shouldn't be judgmental give her a chance. Anyways i hope you two work out Best of luck!|`|VYvpDsDIaa	give her a chance . looks shouldnt matter that much .|`|HB0IivI3aa	Don't. It'd make her feel bad.|`|jOTN2MgMaa	tell her shes fat|`|04hIdBbYaa	I think you should tell her the truth, that way you'll get it off your chest and she will stop calling you. If you keep lying to her she will just keep calling you and wanting to get together with you again. I would tell her that you just don't like how she's just gained a lot of weight and just let her self go. If it hurts her feelings then she will realize that she has let herself go and she'll work harder towards a better body. It's the best thing to do.|`|9bcCsZbPaa	just tell her you don't feel for her like that anymore, and that you ahve moved on..<br>  then that way you don't have to hurt her feelings about her weight :/|`|vwoqIUR6aa	i wouldn't if I were youmaybe  just encourage her to do something about. how about saying like "lets go for a walk". try and motivate her. maybe something happened to her which made her really depressed and this is why she is fat. I don't know but I think it's rude to say you don't want to go out with her becuase she is fat.|`|r5zy8jMgaa	Just say listen your a really nice girl but i'm just not in that place right now. If you want to be friends say lets still keep in touch. You can't ever have too many friends. Don't mention the weight. :-)|`|7QFU0sAOaa	I would just tell her you're not interested in her anymore, but it was nice to see her again.|`|4v2ZTZvAaa	U should have told her the truth!!|`|g4nlUfmeaa	Just respond back telling her that you're sorry, but that you don't think you're interested.  If she insists on a reason, try to be vague ... you can put it like you have here "the flame wasn't there," etc.  If she doesn't let up until you get specific or asks again if it's her weight, just try to refuse to answer. "Let's please just drop it." "It's not important."  Apologize for leading her on a bit but tell her that you felt like you were put on the stop and weren't sure how to react.  She DID put you in a somewhat unfair, uncomfortable position, and it doesn't sound like someone who deserves a lot of your sympathy anyway.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  I would try to being outright dishonest, though.  Her feelings ultimately are not your responsibility, and don't too much time waste coddling her.  Some women will use their insecurity as a passive-aggressive weapon, or even tool of seduction.  Be respectful, avoid causing her unnecessary pain, but don't let her draw you into a situation where she can guilt-trip you, or where you may get tangled up in a web of your own lies.|`|RNqHL8y7aa	Tell her that it's been a long time, and that she isn't what you are looking for anymore, but that you would like to stay good friends. :/|`|x36n3kKcaa	tell her she had her chance and she blew it|`|AA11841749	Tell her you've moved on, and you think it would be best if yall just remained friends.|`|uPAO6eZdaa	AGREE TO A DATE AND INSTEAD OF DINNER TAKE HER TO JENNY CRAIG AND SHE'LL GET THE POINT.|`|0WYCfpDHaa	what's wrong with a little junk in the trunk|`|R2teBtllaa	just be like.<br>  <br>  "last time i checked your the one who dumped me,,and i lost interest afetr that"|`|bttrB0Rfaa	Don't <br>  Go with the fact there was no spark. <br>  Hey you've both changed over the years & the same things don't do it for you that did 8 years ago.  <br>  You could even say something about having feelings for another girl. You know her, do you think she could take it as constructive criticism & motivate to do some self improving or that it would just plain old hurt?|`|mldo1vxYaa	Dont tell her its her weight because it will upset her, you will show yourself for the shallow pig you are and break her heart, on the other hand she might be glad she had a lucky escape.<br>  <br>  What if you had of had a baby? Would you have dumped her as soon as she had the baby and you realised there was weight left? Or would you wait til she was 40 and realise she didnt look like a 20 yr old anymore. Grow up and grow a pair.
ErmcT4uUaa	The answer is that he is a guy.<br>  And guys like sex.<br>  Thats just the way god made them.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Guys can be  as Christian as they want, but their wieners still worship the devil.|`|7XIa76Usaa	This is for Crow Lady, you are the one who better read your Bible. If you attend a church ask your pastor & if he says it is ok you better find a new church.|`|gAuIixm6aa	The Bible does not condemn premarital sex-- maybe you should try reading it|`|WRC0O6tqaa	yes u should end relation with him he is not a good lover he love u just for sex and will leave u after having sex .. ru a muslim?|`|R0U4qy6haa	bless- you|`|IE46NZrYaa	im christian and go to church but i still have sex with my boyfriend. we've been going out for almost 2 years. i was raised to think sex before marriage was wrong but i don't think it is if you're in a committed relationship. it's not the same as going around slutting it up and having one night stands. <br>  but in saying that don't do anything you don't want or don't let him force you into anything if you don't want to do it.|`|333W9jeCaa	If he can't back off & respect your decision to wait for sex until marriage, then he's not the right one for you. Move on, God will send the right guy your way. Alot of men (and women) can claim to be Christian just to try to gain your trust, etc with hidden intentions. Give him an ultimatum, either he respects you & fights back his desires, or he goes. You aren't obligated to do anything with him, keep strong & do not give in. God bless.|`|brKp7aF6aa	Okay first of all just because he wants to have sex before marriage does not necessarily mean he is not a christian. I mean yes many people think it is wrong and more power to you for waiting until marriage I think that is awesome, but just because he wants to doesn't make him a "non-christian"<br>  <br>  Also, the whole dating online thing, people are not always who they say they are.|`|vPjbSBhJaa	Your "christian" boyfriend tries to have sex with you because he is a sane, rational, normal human being with biological urges. He hasn't let superstition completely control his life. I think it is best you two parted ways. This situation can only lead to conflict.|`|yb01tlviaa	Obviously hes not as christian as you thought him to be...|`|Em5PSrUgaa	It could be true that he is a "Christian". Being religious or Christian means a lot of things to a lot of different people. Just look at how many religions there are! <br>  <br>  At his age,(and yours) it's only natural to want to "get it on". But if you and what you believe in dictates that it is wrong to do before marriage, then you'll have to explain to him, and any other guy you date, how important that is to you. <br>  <br>  Some guys will undertstand and stay, some will understand and leave, some will say that they understand and see how far they can go anyway...and then leave. <br>  <br>  Dealing with guys and their hormones is the burden that you'll just have to bear until you meet the right one. Heads up: that would be the one who you fall in love with, who also loves you, and OMG...STAYS! Good luck! ;)|`|G7HqVOC8aa	1 Corinthians 6:9,10<br>  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <br>  <br>  <br>  YES someone deffinately does need to read their Bible because premarital sex is fornication and is condemned in the word of God. <br>  <br>  Sweetie, not everyone who is a Christian is mature in the Lord. Just because someone is claiming to be a Christian doesnt mean they are walking in their faith. It is inappropriate for your boyfriend to try to manipulate you into having sex. If you are serious about your relationship with the Lord do not do it.  Save yourself for the one that respects you and most of all respects the Lord and His ways.|`|uwaAcgyiaa	Unbelievable....its not sinful to have sex while you are in a relationship... have you not read the old testament.... there is loads of this kind of thing happening..... and yet god loved them all anyway, as long as they were not sleeping around the place with everybody and other people husbands and wives.<br>  We were given genitals for a reason, and it feels good, why because god made it so, so we would do more of it.<br>  You dont have to be married just to have sex.... your happiness depends on how you get on together, your outlook on life, and your sexual relationship is extremely important...You might not think it, but it can make or break a relationship easily enough.

d0b4766c80603988f62747e14effa4e7aa	an excerpt from the book, All I Really Need To Know I Learned in Kindergarten <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten.<br>  ALL I REALLY NEED TO KNOW about how to live and what to do <br>  and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not <br>  at the top of the graduate-school mountain, but there in the <br>  sandpile at Sunday School. These are the things I learned:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Share everything. <br>  <br>  Play fair. <br>  <br>  Don't hit people. <br>  <br>  Put things back where you found them. <br>  <br>  Clean up your own mess. <br>  <br>  Don't take things that aren't yours. <br>  <br>  Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody. <br>  <br>  Wash your hands before you eat. <br>  <br>  Flush. <br>  <br>  Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you. <br>  <br>  Live a balanced life - learn some and think some<br>  and draw and paint and sing and dance and play <br>  and work every day some. <br>  <br>  Take a nap every afternoon. <br>  <br>  When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, <br>  hold hands, and stick together. <br>  <br>  Be aware of wonder.<br>  Remember the little seed in the styrofoam cup: <br>  The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody <br>  really knows how or why, but we are all like that. <br>  <br>  Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even <br>  the little seed in the Styrofoam cup - they all die. <br>  So do we. <br>  <br>  And then remember the Dick-and-Jane books <br>  and the first word you learned - the biggest<br>  word of all - LOOK. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Everything you need to know is in there somewhere. <br>  The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.<br>  Ecology and politics and equality and sane living. <br>  <br>  Take any of those items and extrapolate it into <br>  sophisticated adult terms and apply it to your <br>  family life or your work or your government or<br>  your world and it holds true and clear and firm. <br>  Think what a better world it would be if <br>  all - the whole world - had cookies and milk about <br>  three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with<br>  our blankies for a nap. Or if all governments <br>  had a basic policy to always put thing back where <br>  they found them and to clean up their own mess. <br>  <br>  And it is still true, no matter how old you<br>  are - when you go out into the world, it is best <br>  to hold hands and stick together.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Never say yes, when you really want to say no.

ZDB9Jermaa	Alcoholics go on cry-baby periods every now and then.You must know, they are middly tipsy and contemplating their failures, then they find the phone.My mother calls me when she's like this. I wouldn't pay much attention to him if I were you. If there's a chance he's cleaning up his act he will call you back or try to meet with you.You shouldn't make it easy for him but if you really want to talk to him and know what is going on in his head, text him and ask him to explain.Tell him to call you when he's making sense.|`|PBdPD748aa	aw thats sad that you dont know whether he was normal or not :(<br>  <br>  well think about it first. do you want him back in your life? will he bring you happiness or sadness? think about him being an alcoholic and whether you think it is best to have communication with him, you are old enough now to do this.<br>  <br>  if you think you would like to give it a shot i would call him. it may have been him asking you to go out the best way he knew how. call him and confront him about it and say you got the call and message and you would love to go out with him. (explain you dont like water though). but if you dont want him back in your life, simply ignore the call and message and move on.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	if you don't know what he is talking about text him back and say, i don't know what you mean.|`|srjPOxW7aa	I would think that "don't wait up buddy" means he's not doing that fishing trip with you, at least not now. and by the way since your dad  has the "irresponsible drunk" title, when you see him do what you want to do on your terms. Not some fishing trip in the ocean.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	well it is interesting that he called you after you not seeing him for a long time . maybe he meant by not waiting  up for him or seeing him something like that i do not know. i would suggest speaking to your mom and ask her what does she think<br>  maybe he meant  by you not waiting up to see him|`|89owZt6Haa	sounds like some sort of mental illness.  don't take it personally.|`|QPp7zQQpaa	Alcohol does kill brain cells, in case you wonder, but seriously, could it be he is referring to your fear of large bodies of water?<br>  Like "don't wait up"? Sounds as if he was telling you to confront your fears. But hey, what do i know?<br>  Text him back and ask him to call you because you did not get what he wants to express. In any case, even if you do not want to contact him as a father anymore, at least you will know what he wants.|`|qxwwkzx7aa	Well i had a father who was a drug attic and a drunkie 4 most of my kid life and i mean the wat it  sounds is he wants yyou a lone and that may mean something in a good way or a bad way so i mean i whouldnt feel that confertable  by the ocean with the way he sounds so have someone bigger than oyyu go with good luck and remender make a wise decision!!!
Molu004zaa	If this is honestly how you plan on living your life, you're a douche. <br>  NO WOMAN wants a man who treats her like sh*t. NO WOMAN! Why don't you wake up and realize that you can be a good guy and still not have women walk all over you? It IS possible.|`|S0MOQGJJaa	I would highly suggest you be your nice gentlemanly self PLEASE! I am telling you if the girls stay with guys who are jerks it's just because the girls think the jerk is good looking but looks are just a perk... Now, girls stoop to that low level of jerkiness because they are insecure, have low self esteem, or desperate... and in most cases all three... but if you stay your nice kind self then i guaruntee you you will find a woman that respects you... oh and the reason why they take advantage is because they don't know how to behave like mature women...|`|X3cCC7H7aa	Name is dirt<br>  <br>  I know a lot about women. You got to get them drunk and screw them. Screw them rough and hard. They wont leave you. If they get crazy, have some friends screw them. Have all your friends screw them. Punch her in the face if she talks back. punch her really hard in the face. Make her face bleed!
7S92b2ZAaa	Hello, my current boyfriend was totally in love with me when he asked me out...and I thought i'd give him a chance, he was quite chubby and a lot of people asked me "why are you with him?" but I stuck to it and we got on really great, his personality overuled his looks and i love him to bits. Plus he's lost lots of weight and become really stylish and he's hot. Infact now, i consider him the more attractive one. So I'd give the guy a chance. And you might end up in a relationship that goes on for like 17 months, like me...still with him now and I'm really happy!|`|QhT9MjEoaa	I never think I am better than another guy or ever think he wasn't in my "league" But I have dated a guy who I wasn't attracted to AT ALL to say the least, we dated I thought it would get better but everytime we kissed I felt like throwing up. It was that bad.|`|ixR3qfYdaa	Yeah, I dated a guy for 1 or 2 months...It just didn't work out. We had nothing in common and he just plain old sucked|`|RHIJ6OPQaa	yeah i kinda do it all the time cuz i feel really bad letting a guy down ! usually it goes okay , i mean sometimes it sucks but generally its okay . and yeah i ended up dating two of them (not at the same time) lol|`|ovbB05lKaa	No because there was usually a reason why I thought I was better than, and usually it involved the concept of sanity.
ErmcT4uUaa	Maybe if he didn't think so much about guys and football he would want you.<br>  I would go find a geek guy who would love to have sex with you.|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	Well he said it doesn't matter, so whats the problem?<br>  <br>  He'll let you know when he's ready. Or explain to him that you're ready.|`|mrysAOpGaa	give him time. now you know why you dont believe all of the stereotypes.  everyone assumes that because he was the hot football jock in school he automatically banged out all the girls in school who were willing to open their legs underneath the bleachers after a football game.  When hes ready, youll know, but dont have your expectations set high, it may be quicker than you expect, it may not make you see stars, but thats because its his first time, so when hes ready, dont be judging his first performance.|`|PXN7r0RRaa	move on thats what|`|zWB3jHHPaa	um take it from him when he's not looking LOL|`|se3EnpZqaa	do what u did with ur other boyfriend sis jeez|`|cfFlf1EAaa	let him be a virgin until he is 40|`|1uG7vH1faa	you know what to do, take his virginity
qTTAoEWPaa	Maybe he is afraid just as much as you are.<br>  I think he is just trying to push away from you because he knows he has to leave soon and doesn't want the relationship to get more serious because it will hurt even more.<br>  I do think you should talk to him though. Dont come off as needy, but just tell him that you really do care about him and you want to make the best of his last months and to make it a time worth remembering.<br>  Don't interfere with the relationship of his sister...he is leaving soon so of course he is going to spend time with her. Maybe suggest that one time you all should hang out together because you want to get to know his family more., if he doesn't like the idea, then just leave it alone.<br>  Your not being irrational, your only human and it just shows that you really do care for him.<br>  Just talk to him.|`|e5a37e7afe8ec6690c5df08cdf7e5e71aa	you only have two options here, live with it, or let it go. I think you already know this relationship is slipping away, but if you really want it to work, all you can do is go with the flow and see what happens. Personally, I think you should let this one go if this is already making you feel like crap, him being in Italy is not going to make anything better for you. seeing how much you dont see one another, why didnt he invite you to go parachuting with him? I dont know, I can assume a lot of things but I think you already know it is over with him. I know I am not one for long distance relationships, it changes everything. I was with my ex bf for three years, he moved away for a job, when we talked over the phone, he seemed to be moving further and further away meeting new people and such. he was turning into something different, so i ended it. word has it he still loves me, if that were true, he shouldnt have left me. I do not regret letting him go, it hurt for year, but believe it or not, you do move on, if I would have waited for him and his money in the mail, i would be a lonely housewife.
uSDb8fBpaa	got a few friends in the military.  As you can tell his time is very limited.  But hes still attempting to make time for you so look at ti that way :3.  Also being in the military does have good benefits so take that into the account that he does have ambition and seems to want you there in those ambitions.  =D|`|gZmIk7k3aa	just be patient you are fully allowed to be upset for missing him but just remember no matter what he loves you my girlfriend soon to n\be fiance moved to pensyvania and we have this problem but somehow we are workin through it so i know you can
BKr3y30maa	Please tell me you are joking?  He obviously has respect for you....otherwise he would already be jumping into your panties!  It's a good thing, trust me.  You need to hang on to this guy.|`|p0pDGL6zaa	This guy right here has a BRAIN.<br>  he thinks with his BRAIN and not his PENIS.<br>  you need to hang in there, and stay close to him.<br>  why did you say "friends" with him for 4 yours..you two should be DATING!!|`|ZyWMPooJaa	this guy is NOT a waste of time. he has incredible respect for u, the respect i show most people. he needs to fix his job situation and he will be back. hes staying distant from u because he doesnt want to get distracted by his gf while hes trying to get a job. good luck.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Just be more patient. There aren't many guys who actually try to fix their own issues before being involved with a girl, anyway, so you should at least be glad for that.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	When guys are unemployed, many of them suffer self-esteem issues.  Generally they want to take their girlfriend out or be able to buy her something.  It's almost akin to a woman having difficulty concentrating at work when her love life is tumultous.<br>  <br>  Right now, I wouldn't push the relationship anymore than it is.  I wouldn't worry about sexual advances as they will come in time if that is what is supposed to happen with you two.  Don't take it personally, like he's not attracted to you.  The large issue of being recently unemployed and his FUTURE is hanging over his head.<br>  <br>  The best you can do right now is hang in there and be his friend.  Be positive by being someone that he WOULD want to be around and spend time with.  Listen to him and do fun things together.  Don't get caught in the trap of paying for most/all things either -- this won't really make him feel better.  Find those fun things that don't cost much if any money to do and just really be with each other having fun.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!  = )
6x2cRz7naa	i think he has a right to be upset if youve been having sex for a year and all the sudden you want to stop.  if youve told him the total truth and how you feel about it, hopefully he will understand, but i hope you know that its likely things might not ever be the same, or he might just want to break up... if you were ok with it for a year why suddenly stop now??|`|p75MeVQ9aa	Why does it matter if you wait until you're married. The only difference is that the government and church recognize it. <br>  <br>  Do you honestly believe that God will only recognize a relationship if some priest tells him that it's ok to recognize it now? The whole theory of marriage was developed in a time when women were property, that's why it's such a big "show". <br>  <br>  To prove that, the origins of the word "rape" are from the latin word which means "to steal", because women were regarded as property. The whole tirade about sex only after marriage is a "tainted goods" property issue, not a moral issue. <br>  <br>  If you honestly think that it's so important perhaps you should do all other things the bible suggests, such as crushing children with rocks if they badmouth their parents etc. <br>  <br>  Of course your bf is a good guy. You just are brainwashed to think he isn't because he doesn't believe in the same mythical crap as you do. <br>  <br>  Omg.|`|dMw0sI0raa	You shouldn't have to lower your standards to meet his "needs." If he is not willing to stop and wait, then he is not worth it. Even if he does not believe in God, he should respect what you believe. Unfortunately in today's society this is "normal" but that doesn't mean that it is right. He may not be a bad guy, he's just driven by his nature. He lacks both self control and respect. Personally I think you deserve better. I know it's hard, especially if you have been in this relationship for a long time. But in the end you have to do what is best for you, even if that means giving him up. And believe it or not, there will be a guy out there who is just right for you and will respect your decisions.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	wow this is a hot debate.<br>  <br>  Hes not bad but let me put you in our perspective.  If he loves you and your having sex.  Then you just cut him off think of what that does to him.  At first yes he would be fine but its like pressure.  Same as if say he would never be able to tell you he loved you again.  <br>  <br>  Would bug you wouldn't it?|`|vslC8rB0aa	Notice how he calls it 'making love' when it's about to stop? Sex shouldn't matter is he thinks you are truly the one for him. He will respect your decision and masturbate until you two get married. And if you continue, you will feel sick each time you finish sex because it's not what you want.|`|ZXxgz4Xtaa	Umm of course not, trust me after giving him sex for a year just suddenly taking that away will ruin your relationship. Don't do it, hate to say it but you should of thought of this a year ago :\|`|PaUV3pnpaa	ha ha i think its too late to stop having sex with him now. <br>  <br>  you already lost your virginity so you cant get it back and you've been with this guy for over a year so there nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  and if he doesn't believe in god doesn't make him a bad person he was either raised that way or hes lost faith.<br>  <br>  but the fact that he doesn't wanna be with you if you dint sleep with him - that's when i would get rid of him. clearly he doesn't love as much if he can even say that to your face.|`|YTasscmKaa	Hes not a bad guy, no. And you shouldn't feel guilty above having sex as part of a long term committed relationship.|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	He is not a bad guy.  And after a year of sex, asking him to either quit cold turkey or marry you if you haven't discussed marriage previously comes across more like a whopper of a guilt trip than anything else.<br>  <br>  Is there a reason you can't/won't get married?????<br>  <br>  You can't put toothpaste back in the tube once it's out, and you can't really take sex off the table once you've started it.  Certainly not after a year.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't believe in God and you do and want to worship him in such a way that precludes pre-marital sex, you have bigger issues in front of you than sex.  That difference in views is a major one that has to be resolved.<br>  <br>  You need to either keep the status quo, marry him, or break up with him.  The guilt is yours.  You need to resolve that guilt in some fashion.<br>  <br>  And you can't be feeling that guilty, if the sex is great.  You only feel guilty afterwards.  That should tell you something.  It isn't stopping you.|`|Bsf78pfsaa	First of all its a little late a year later and now you want to stop you should have thought about that before now I would talk to him but you cant make him want God|`|AA11662302	What God wants from us is way more important than any other relationship.|`|cLad8HuLaa	WELL I UNDRSTAND DAT HE WANTS 2 MAKE LUV W/U BUT IF HE REALLY LUVS U HE WUD AGREE W/U.|`|AA11435607	u should leave him. U SHOULD find someone that love God.. if u love God u will do that..
zCE0slQ5aa	your 14. be patient. if you want to be more attractive, find out what personality traits are unattractive about you and work on those.<br>  Are you happy? Are you bubbly? Are you confident? Do you treat people with respect?<br>  <br>  If you want people to respond positively to you, show them how wonderful they are by treating them with honesty, kindness and respect.<br>  <br>  You are attractive in every way.<br>  <br>  Don't think you are,...know you are! :)
ECkj80cUaa	I get that butterfly, tingly thing when he says or does something with out being prompted or asked- just because he knows me so well.  Or when I catch him watching me with 'that look' on his face.  <br>  I overheard him talking with some guy friends a while back- he didn't know I was there, and he was just saying the best stuff about me and our marriage in general conversation. I just melted.|`|Qkjt2GVEaa	drinking takes me back to simpler times -
4hPwn7ilaa	Yeah, I know what you mean I've gone through the same thing & I'm actually going through it now. Guys can be soooo complicated sometimes. Well you never know maybe he got a gf & sometimes when a guy has a gf he'll sometimes stop talking to certain girls especially if they're close. Maybe he started liking you & is just scared.|`|AA11480344	Maybe he likes you or has started developing feelings for you.<br>  OR<br>  He just felt like being shy for a day. :P
ovbB05lKaa	Uhm honesty is a very important thing.<br>  Lying is stupid.|`|62viFod1aa	He's being boastful, it's rude trollbait.
1Qha5gwVaa	Of course she was not lying you silly!  If the girl said she likes you then she really must like you. There are not many girls that admit this that easily.<br>  She likes you. I tell you again.|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	yeah..she likes you.. im really open bout that stuff too.. but if i liked you i'd prob tell you to your face|`|sCCjAKllaa	If she didn't like you, then I doubt she would lie about it. Don't be so paranoid.|`|ju5hVva8aa	im a chick, and i wud personally tell the friend of the guy i like if i liked him. cuz then the friend wud tell him. Belive me, if she didnt want u 2 kno, she wudnt of told ur friend, knowing tht hes gna go straight bak 2 u and tell u. she tottaly likes u!|`|Q7DXrxMTaa	she obviously likes you if shes telling your friend!!!<br>  <br>  she probably is way too shy to tell you to your face and is now very happy that somehting might finally happen since she told your friend<br>  <br>  so go for it!!<br>  <br>  ask her out!!|`|Nsp2UAlIaa	why does she have to lie?|`|IRbveMBaaa	just keep it chill,and be a man and ask her xd|`|YJH5YcjBaa	Uhmm a quick conversation is what I see that's off like girls don't say that like " oh yeah and I really like Joe, see you tomorrow bye"...usually in a sorda deep conversation a girl will admit that to a friend of the guy because she knows he/she is ging to "snitch"/tell him and that's the goal right??<br>  :]<br>  <br>  If your friend is known for joking around he/she could be lying because I don't think a girl would say that in a quick convo<br>  ...Anywho<br>  Good Luck xo|`|FNMMm7Dnaa	girls never lie about who they like, they lie about who they don't like!|`|dVkCZpADaa	She soooo likes you :) Go for it and ask her out. Good Luck!|`|RoyvUWl7aa	I"m a girl, I'd totally tell someone if I liked a guy.She likes  you dude!|`|XkkADjL0aa	Um I don't think she's lying. Ur friend may b though|`|K8UjtbiSaa	well think about it - if she didnt, i doubt she would just make it up!!<br>  i think she likes you (: (: x|`|HSrBpGqkaa	well if she didnt like u she wud say so|`|z8rkQ8h2aa	In all of my experience with drama in my grade we girls mean it when they say they like someone. If you don't believe me just talk to her and when she's not aeound all of friends ask her if she likes you ( not being around other people just keeps them from going "ohhhhh" when you're talking) if she says she likes you then she does.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	I totally tell my guy friends when I like a guy. Then I sit and watch them try and tell me all about him, his faults and stuff. It's cute! But seriously, we do tell guys when we like a guy. She likes you and I think you should go for it.|`|oKLmS2CVaa	some time its true it hard to tell if it is if a girl ask her and she says yes then thats true but a guy thats a nother story|`|k6qxIPJBaa	it all depends on the age, iv noticed the older i get the more i come out wen i like a guy,<br>  so yeaa mayb|`|vP9BuEOvaa	yeah she likes you ... ask her out!
lsFDEx2oaa	It's very normal to have cold feet when feeling nervous/anxious over anything, especially with a boyfriend/fiancee/spouse, etc.  It doesn't mean that its not right, it means that you are nervous/anxious/excited.  <br>  <br>  Age has nothing to do with being ready; its a mental thing.  You will know when you're ready.  Yes, it's cliche, but its true.  If you constantly question it, you're not.  Timing in one person's life doesn't mean its right for the other person.  Time constraints do not make you more open and ready to handle a situation like this.  <br>  <br>  Finally, love and moving in together are two different things.  Moving in together is a step in a relationship, but how do you know if you love them?  One simple act doesn't not mean that you love them.  It means you're evolving as a couple.  Don't confuse and mix and match things.  Take it slow, go with the flow-- if you feel you're ready.|`|WPZI510laa	i love my boyfriend, and i moved in with him.  The first year was HORRIBLE.  We fought almost everyday, and it totally sucked, but i stuck it out, and we've been living together for 2 years now, and it is much better now then at first.<br>  <br>  BTW i was 21 when we moved in together|`|y4w6ybr3aa	It's completely normal. It's a big step,but living with someone is the best way to see if you are compatible with each other or not.<br>  Your young..enjoy your time together. I hope it all works out for you two, but if not you can always move out.|`|0KCtIJWYaa	Follow your heart you will know when you are ready and when it is too soon. Your heart is always leading you in the right direction you may get hurt or let down a few times but it is all about the experiences.|`|HB0IivI3aa	Yes it's normal, I just moved in with my girlfirend and I was worried at the start u'll get used to it :)|`|uSDb8fBpaa	cold feet is normal.  Heres a idea though.  Go stay with him for a week.  If things go well give it the go.  If not take some time to figure it out.<br>  <br>  Simple enough?|`|XjldUzvnaa	it wont work out.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	If you don't have true feelings for him, and feel uncomfortable, then don't move in with him. Maybe date him a while more, and then if you feel better about the situation, THEN see what it's like living with him. I'm moving in with my boyfriend in June, and I'm only doing so because I love him and know it's the right choice. You could always spend a weekend over there and get a feel for what it's like living with him, then make your choice. Or maybe even try it for a week, and see how it turns out? The worst that can happen is you end up back at your mom's.
Xf93fRTTaa	Ask him straight up. If he's a decent human being, he will be honest with you.<br>  <br>  Or, you could just break up with him as he is not worth your time.|`|gPdj4lCuaa	Just be straight up with him. I know my boyfriend isn't cheating on me but I told him if he ever cheated on me or ever wanted to or anything like that, to just tell me. I would rather know about it, and leave him then have him doing it and staying with him months and months on end wasting my time not knowing when I can use that time to grieve and get over it. <br>  <br>  Just ask him, are you, or are you not cheating on me? Ask him about the sock and have him look right in your eyes. Don't have him eating, or being on the computer, or anything that can occupy him. Sit on the bed, with nothing in your hands, and no gum or anything in his mouth and ask him straight up. Have him look right in your eyes when he answers. You both have to be in a content mood, no anger or anything, it might not turn out well if there is anger. I always know when my boyfriend is lying. It is easy to tell because I ketch on to his body language and face expressions very well. Even a little movement of the eye or the lip or something, I can tell if he is lying. I shouldn't have to do the test though because he should be telling the truth but sadly the lie detector has to happen. <br>  He tried to get away with lying and made up this hole story about him putting my picture up in his locker, when he said that, I knew he didn't do it. It turned out, he had the picture in his computer case. Even small things like that, I can tell if hes lying. So try that lie detector test. It really works!!!|`|P058Ex6haa	hmmm thats tricky, if i was you i would just get rid of him if he loves you as much as you love him then he wouldnt be cheating on you in the first place. Its unfair on you and your just going to get really hurt the longer you leave it, you may love this guy and think there is no-one else that you want in the world, but believe me there are always plenty more fish in the sea. You deserve better!!|`|DyuXD9Evaa	i must admit that the toothbrush thing doesnt really sound very suspicious..the sock thing could be explained...but whats worrying is the fact that neither of you have said "i love you" in about a month...it sounds like you may be neglecting him...but if he is cheating on you then he should be castrated...but i dont think you should jump to conclusions so quickly...try talking to him...i mean this is a huge problem with very many relationships...you need to talk more and communicate better with him<br>  <br>  good luck though|`|M6kFBTXhaa	I'm sorry to hear this. But how can you be with him after something like this? Obviously he isn't who you thought he was. As someone who has wasted her time giving second chances ( and 8th chances) please understand that cheaters don't change. Love? he doesn't love you if he can cheat on you.
70At0HClaa	i'd cut my arm off and beat you over the head with bloody stump to have legs like yours .|`|n708rCp0aa	no,nonono absolutely not!<br>  theyre just mean. :P<br>  you have great legs, honestly.|`|TIGfdEhfaa	muscly not manly|`|YhKBmy2Taa	no, not at all.|`|QgIxioouaa	it doesn't matter what other people think just make sure that you know that you  are beautiful and who knows they probably they have somethimg that isn't perfect about them that they don't want to tell anyone about it but their just hiding it.please write back.|`|SPMS5yIuaa	pshhh u look fine what so you have a little muscle i think men find that nice thats just me. And there long the person that told you that was prolly short and stubby there just jealouse:) dont worry be gratefull u dont have stubs.|`|JjsArGujaa	definately not sweetie(:|`|18d9aa70c53578f18caa307002ccab93aa	No.|`|cUPTVC99aa	Not at all!|`|jC2p7l3Saa	no your fine why do doubt yourself|`|DmgBlycRaa	no way<br>  <br>  they were jealous|`|7OLg13B8aa	no but you cant tell with stockings
hLWy1evQaa	Absolutely not. <br>  <br>  There is always going to be attraction, lust, and temptation out there. But you can't possibly "fall" for somebody truly, if you have already "fallen" for four other people. <br>  <br>  You can crush on a few people at one time, but that doesn't mean you're in love with all of them. If you truly have "fallen" for somebody and love them, then you'll only love that person, otherwise it's not truly love. <br>  <br>  If you love somebody, you'll acknowledge the attraction of others, and maybe even indulge in a little flirting. But because you care deeply for the person you're with, that's all it will ever amount to. There's no way to be "in love" with multiple people. Out of 2 people, you're always going to love one more than the other. But you can't honestly LOVE five people at the same time, because then it's not real.|`|k0paaE5maa	Yeah it's possible. This is what is commonly referred to as "slutty behavior", leading to things such as gangbangs, lack of motivation to do anything in life because these guys will buy things for you, etc.<br>  <br>  Or you could be ugly and in that case you're just desperate and the former paragraph doesn't apply to you.|`|cKDBwNITaa	um yeah i guess but its not really a good thing.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Only if they stand in line to trip you. I can't see how.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	If you are talking about "true love" then no I don't think it's possible,|`|59iSPST0aa	I suppose it is, you probably like certain things in each of them. I suggest you really thing about the one that you like the best, and just stick with one, as this may really confuse and mess you up.
RKQHRMusaa	well maybe. but if you act like friends then thats all you are. but aparently your married to edward cullen anyway ;)|`|QFEbDUTAaa	either he is really close to you as BFF or he likes you.<br>  !! simple, you should break the barrier and see how he react.. it help for a girl to give a go sign we usually get away with it later..|`|f6DrbA28aa	OMG!!! He likess (i mean loves) you! If you like him tell him if he feels the same way. And just don't care what everyone thinks. Don't always care about what other people think cause thats what makes you Special form everyone else<br>  <br>  <br>     GOOD LUCKK!!! <3<3|`|jks5MxiNaa	I think he likes you and if you don't feel the same then you should tell him to back off so that you and he can remain friends.|`|qxwwkzx7aa	well. Do you like him and tell everyone that loks at you to stop looking at you that your not dating and if then say anything elsse tell them to swerw OF!!!|`|62e9ba78ee48eedceb41743f5846f0a9aa	haha awww. Well if you like him, talk to him & ask him if you are dating. & if you don't like him stop wearing his stuff.
955qCxI9aa	Anything more than friends is a no no. Even if he is from another country.  You are married.|`|APy56tkZaa	As long as it is kept on a platonic status & you are hiding nothing from your spouse, you are doing nothing wrong in my opinion.<br>  Should your husband express any doubts then you should listen & cease communicating with your friend.|`|WeIcJ1CNaa	i guarantee you the guy wants you. First he's from another country and making the effort to stay in contact, No matter how nice he is or how he plays it its obvious he wants to do you i suppose you know what i'm getting at. Guys don't make friends with girls so quick and especially if its overseas he like your more then just a friend. Now you gotta think is it wrong to lead a guy wrong or innocent. I say wrong. Sure have guy friends but a work and so on. a picture of you might help cuz if ur goodlooking then i need no say more
TTfTTlcCaa	Women refuse to exercise?!<br>  <br>  ****!  All this time I've been exercising and I was supposed to be refusing.  Why doesn't anybody tell me these things?<br>  <br>  AND I didn't even know I should have been just been standing there and flexing, instead of flirting.  Thank god for you, man!  Now I'm on the right track.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	The 2 aren't mutually exclusive; its not look good or flirt, both are important. While you're right that if a girl is unattractive then flirting will get her nowhere, I would also say that if she is attractive but doesn't flirt, I may not see her personality and therefore might not notice her. Or if I do notice her because she looks good, I might think she seems cold and unapproachable. Flirting IS important, but so is looking good, can't have one without the other.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "Men don't notice girls "flirting", it has zero effect on men, so why bother? "  Umm, I notice.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself dude; you see a smoking hot girl sitting at the bar. But she is straight faced and staring forward. Not talking to anybody.<br>  Or you see a smoking hot girl at the bar, and she is making conversation with you, laughing, smiling, touching your hand, etc...<br>  Assuming that both of these girls want you; which one is more likely to get you? <br>  Flirting works. And if I'm wrong in speaking about you, then that's just you. It works with me. Why wouldn't it?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Angel has a point dude. You sound like an idiot.<br>  <br>  Flirting vs. exercise theory - FAIL|`|j9mQmbHAaa	im probably wrong<br>  as im a girl  not a guy<br>  <br>   but i use flirting when i like a guy, to give an indication im keen/interested<br>  i find it works :S<br>  <br>  i dont get what gym has to do with this im not fat<br>  but if a guy comes up and talks to me<br>  doesnt flirting kind of come about naturally<br>  like that whole "spark" thing..<br>  <br>  i am confused now  lol|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Not every guy hits on every hot girl who walks by.  Some dudes might wait for some encouragement from the sexy chick at the gym so he is certain that her 'roided up boyfriend isn't gonna kick his *** for trying to flirt with her. <br>  <br>  You get the picture.
fDYxwfYwaa	Go ahead--it may work for you as it did for me.|`|DbJO0SvZaa	i think you should txt him first make sure its ok to call or see if he like you|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	Dial the number on a VOICE phone and talk to him. That is how it was done before there was texting, and it is much more of a personal touch because you can learn a lot more from hearing his voice than impersonal text.
pmlg4GAsaa	Picture it this way: You're a girl.  You do not know if any guy is going to ask you out and there is nothing you can do about it because you can't take the initiative.<br>  <br>  And who says guys have to take the initiative?  I've been hit on and asked out by several girls.  Though most of them I either turned down or never made plans with because I'm a f*cking retard.  So I remain dateless.<br>  <br>  Like I said, I have asperger's syndrome and haven't had much luck with girls.  Now I'm beginning to worry that I might end up like you.|`|AA11849364	Maybe you are asking the wrong girls. I still think you are trying too hard. Lol, I'm 50, and I still haven't found the"right" person( though I've been married0_o). My last "official" bf  one of my biological brothers<br>  "stole" from me, so, lol, imagine how I feel. If you just want someone to talk to from time to time when you get lonely, I could make a bot for you.

I wouldn't necessarily say you're so ugly, but the super hot girls are generally only going to be interested in the alpha male types anyway. You mentioned in other posts that you have some sexual experience, which shows your social skills can't be that bad.
JCdBSULraa	Ok this is crap.  Stop acting like it's a disability or an excuse.   Asperger's syndrome is more positive than negative, and if you can see it that way, you'll still be able to interact.  It can be difficult during formative years, but once you move your focus away from whatever it may be towards yourself and your social behavior, it's very easy to integrate with other people and be very sociable.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	I really don't know what to say--but I think there is someone out there for everyone.  You do have a social defecit, but I think it is something that you can learn to overcome through getting coaching on how to use better social skills.  Like anything else--you can learn what others expect in developing a relationship.  <br>  <br>  There must be help groups out there for young adults like yourself to help you meet others struggling with your situation. If there isn't, why not form a yahoo group for 20-somethings with Aspergers where they can share their experiences? Sometimes you can make some great friends online and you never know if maybe there is someone out there that you can get to know that way.<br>  <br>  Relationships take work--whether you have social awkwardness or not.  They don't come easily to a lot of people.<br>  <br>  Your weight sounds a little on the high side for someone your height--but you look like you carry it well.  It wouldn't hurt to get a bit more excercise and tone up a bit... sometimes it is good to get more physical activity when your mind is overworked...  Might be good for you to have an outlet for pent up thoughts that can be worked out physically.  You have a nice smile and nice eyes... eyebrows are a bit bushy...maybe have them shaped to better accentuate your eyes. :)  Play up your advantages I always say!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/kiss_my_aspergers/?v=1&t=search&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=group&slk=109">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/kis...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aspergers_syndrome_disorder/?v=1&t=search&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=group&slk=133">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/asp...</a><br>  <br>  Do a Google search for "Aspie Adults" and you may find some web pages that highlight organizations in your part of the world... it might help you to join some organization that can help you better cope with your issues and find ways to develop a romantic relationship with someone special.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Quoting you: "C'mon, males with Asperger Syndrome have it a lot harder than females with Asperger Syndrome, since us males always have to ask the girl out, make the first move, start the conversation, pursue the girl, overall, we have to take the initiative, we have to initiate the date and relationship, girls are never going to pursue or chase guys, so that makes it even harder for males with Asperger Syndrome. Heck, I know a guy that is 36 and has Asperger Syndrome, he is still a virgin, never had a girlfriend, never dated, it would not surprise me if I end up like him."<br>  <br>  Says who?|`|Pelf56DHaa	Some girls in this world actually find it acceptable to make the first move. Don't lose hope. If you do then you are right you might never have a girlfriend.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	try losing some weight...first of all....and second, stop crying and whining.|`|AA11849364	Andrew( *sigh) have you ever thought about asking God to lead you to  the woman you are "destined" to be with. I personally think you are trying to hard and are scaring away any young girl who might have an interest in you by looking so desperate.<br>  "I am not very outgoing"<br>  Same here^_^, I learned that people like me, or not, when they meet me. If they aren't helping me pay my bills why should I go out of my way to please them?<br>  "I don't have a lot of friends"<br>  I think you have more friends than you know( and a few, like me who are online acquaintances,lol).<br>  "I have never had a girlfriend"<br>  One day, you might look back and think how lucky you are. Having a relationship with another human is tough, and never, never like it is in the movies. If you want someone around who is a perfect companion, I'd suggest you get a dog. My dog was the most devoted, the most loving being I have ever been around( relatives included) but in the end, I betrayed him;_;.<br>  "I am never invited to parties or social events in which a lot of people attend"<br>  surely you have radio stations that advertize get togethers, or news papers. Lol, I go to free movies, concerts, partiess ect^_^. Its a start.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You should see a psychologist (or one that actually works for you).  You are going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy because you put too much emphasis on what is wrong with you.  Why not focus on your strengths?  Asperger's Syndrome or not, you are going through EXACTLY the same thing that EVERYONE goes through.  We all feel awkward in social situations, we all get rejected, we all misinterpret the signs that someone is giving us.<br>  <br>  Do you have a disability?  Sure.  Does it have control over you?  Absolutely.  So get the help you need, rather than feeling sorry for yourself, and you'll feel more confident when dealing with these type of situations.|`|6iCOMx8laa	No you should not accept that Asperger's will prevent you from having a girlfriend. Some people are just socially awkward too.<br>  You seem cute. You write well, therefore I think you can communicate clearly and appropriately.  Continue to talk to women. Women friends can help you with pointers and advice. I know it is hard to learn social skills. They do not come natural to a lot of people. Practice, practice, practice... sometimes girls do pursue guys.<br>  Don't give up..|`|kc6XVl2Iaa	i actually feel ppl can b very accepting i have had a crush on a guy for 5 months and he is socially akward and had nevr had a gf or been to an actual party so as far as that goes u can have a gf.|`|IW592N5Zaa	Thats a really bad way to think about it. Yeah, poor social skills make it harder to meet girls, but you will find the girl for you. Don't stop trying or give up hope|`|AA10928214	Maybe you could expain what this syndrome is????<br>  And i'm sure if you grow up and start going out, or talking to girls, someone out there will like you|`|JScCYZ8daa	you should not give up . no on is perfect . were all just different from each other and thats wat makes everyone unique. so keep ya head up high and dont let no dumb a!@ get to you kay|`|b188dffc272fc0cae0706fb1e108d2cbaa	I believe you should continue talking to women and you never know what the future could hold for you.  Don't give up!|`|bttrB0Rfaa	I'm sure match.com has a filter for ths ;)|`|H3lsS3BJaa	Sounds like an upsetting situation to be in..... But don't give up hope!<br>  My ex-boyfriend had Aspergers and although it was a bit difficult, it was definately worth it. You just need to meet the right girl who's willing to look past all of that. And you're a good looking guy, I'm sure you'll find someone!<br>  Good luck =]|`|ypeYciePaa	hey bud, dont lose hope............o and grow yer hair out a bit and wear tighter shirts, I'm 5'11 227lbs and wear Medium, a little on the fluffy side, but also muscular, and very broad shoulders, chicks dig shoulders man. u look like u can pull it off. <br>  <br>  some girl will find yor shortcommings cute.|`|wmLYctdRaa	Never say never hun.<br>  There's someone for everyone.|`|HP7Id4THaa	im so sorry!! you sound and look like an ok guy to me. never give up keep trying! god has a plan  for you i can see it! i wish you luck!!|`|01fHTiGSaa	Have you ever been diagnosed formally? This is an extensive process, not just a hunch your shrink gets after talking to you a couple of times. If not, I wouldn't automatically assume you have Asperger's and think "Oh my God, I'm gonna wind up like that 36-year-old virgin from the Facebook group!" A lot of guys have difficulty understanding and talking to women, it doesn't mean you have Asperger's. In all your posts I have read so far, I don't see any "symptoms" beyond social awkwardness. Do you have any obsessional interests? Routines? Prone to fits of rage? Did your teachers in school hate you because you were eccentric and argumentative? These are some of the "harder" signs of AS, and if you don't really have any of these you probably just are suffering from a lack of confidence. I'm not so sure you're a clear cut case of AS and by labeling yourself you seem to be limiting yourself.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	That's a pretty defeated mentality you have there hon. Just cuz it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't ever happen (the 36 year old virgin aside). You have to be patient. When the right girl comes she won't care that you have Asperger's or that your social skills are below the average humans. I think it is a good sign that you even asked the question, you have kept some hope inside. Be patient, don't give up on love, women or yourself|`|pmlg4GAsaa	I enjoy reading your questions, and the answers to your questions.  I enjoy it because it reminds me that I'm not alone, that someone has it worse than I do with girls.  I may have not had a sexual experience before, but at least I know what true love feels like.  I know what it feels like to be in love with a girl, and to know that she is in love with me.  That was the way I had it with my ex-girlfriend Hannah.  But then she moved to Florida and I've felt really depressed since then.  I didn't want a girlfriend before I met her, but ever since she left I have wanted someone to come and fill the hole she left in my heart.  But I don't think I will ever find someone, and I know I will never find someone like her.  I know I sound kind of emo right now, but my point is everyone has troubles like this, especially people with asperger's syndrome.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then again it seems to me, based on the nature of your questions and of the message you sent me, that you are overly obsessed with having sex and losing your virginity as soon as possible, without having the slightest idea of the emotional ramifications of being in love.  If sex is all you care about, just pick up some chick at a bar, get her drunk, then **** her brains out and get it over with.  It's that easy.  But don't bother getting a girlfriend.  It'll just make things more complicated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please listen to me.  It's people like you who get caught on To Catch a Predator.  Desperate people who will do anything to live out their fantasies.  The fact that you had sex with someone you weren't even attracted to, for free (yes, oral sex is still sex.  To me, you're not a virgin.), just shows how desperate you've become.<br>  <br>  Focus on making friends first.  Personally I believe that most people with asperger's syndrome simply aren't emotionally ready for love or sex until they're like 22.  I know I wasn't ready for Hannah.  Look what she did to me.  We're too immature and unstable to handle relationships, and the down side of that is that we don't get to experience them when we're young, when they are the most enjoyable.  It's a harsh fact of being autistic.<br>  <br>  But it could be worse.  At least we can talk, move around, have jobs, make friends, etc. unlike a lot of autistic people.  Don't worry about it.  As far as I know, most aspies end up eventually getting married and having kids.  But if you act like you're desperate to get into a girl's pants they will find you not only pathetic and repulsive but creepy.  For ****'s sake, stop shooting yourself in the foot.<br>  <br>  <br>  You will know when you've found the right person.  When you are with her you will feel like you're on a cloud.  You will be nervous around her at first.  You will think about her all the time.  No matter how unattractive she is she will seem a million times more beautiful than any other girl.  You will do anything for her, even die for her.  And when you are not with her you will feel like part of you is missing.  And hopefully you will regard her as a human being, not a sex toy.  And then one day she will break your heart, and the cycle will start all over again.<br>  <br>  That's my personal experience anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME!?!?|`|rDnQ6MNYaa	I'll buy off on the asperger's making it hard to interact socially...but some guys are just not good at it and they don't have aspergers.  My advise is that you may be fishing with the wrong bait.  If the fish are not biting on worms no amount of worm bait is going to work.  So what a good fisherman does it move to a new spot and use a new bait.  <br>  <br>  Try the on-line social networking...you wrote a pretty decent question (better than some I've read on this site)  Take that skill and make it work...get to know her on line then move to the real world in a nice public place and take it from there.  I would try to find something that fits for both of you.   Also, explain what you have in terms of hey I like you, but I have this thing...I'm normal---but I'm going to screw up sometimes...it makes be both charming and a pain...but that is the whole me.  Don't use your condition as if it explains your behavior - explain you behavior because you have this condition.
YCSGSlXkaa	As long as he's okay with it, you'll probably get over it -- the only time it's hard to date a shorter guy is when he has a big chip on his shoulder about being short.  Otherwise, you're fine.  And if you can't get over it, then it just means that he's not the right guy.|`|SnWZusBIaa	If you like him then go out with him. Don't be shallow because he's shorter than you.|`|qX5N60YXaa	if you like him the height shouldn't matter :)|`|fGWoRqiRaa	ok this is not a big deal at all height doesnt matter at all go with ur heart and not ur head!!|`|b4e75c5b487a0e6b8386619cf286fea5aa	I can understand he is 5 inches shorter than you and you'd rather have someone taller, but think about it. If you like him, then it shouldn't matter how tall or short he is. Don't judge his height. I wish you the best!|`|ibeVcQyWaa	What's the problem?  So he's a bit shorter, so what.  Worry about what sort of person he is.|`|AA10928214	The height doesn't matter, why should it? As long as you like who they really are inside.
cHM2US6xaa	Why don't you guys kiss on the couch, and let her sit on your lap and make out :P|`|ITWah6iAaa	make her stand on one step of a stair case and u stand on one step lower this always works out trust me same prob<br>  <br>  vote me best answer plez
3mUaIBffaa	Wait...have you ever even talked to her??? I mean if you have, and you know her alittle, then that is really sweet and you should tell her you how you feel. and maybe ask her on a date.<br>  yea i kinda had the same thing happen to me once.....I saw this guy at a swim meet and just something clicked and I knew that I wanted him to be mine.....luckily I did get a chance =).....|`|dHkvVlONaa	Umm well I had something similar happen.  Like 3 or 4 years ago I was walking around town with my friend and we walked past the funeral home, and her cousin was in the parking lot and he came up and hugged her.  And like, I liked him but like I never talked to him or anything and like 3 years went by and i didn't even see him, but then last summer we like started hanging out and stuff and now we're really close.  I don't think you love her it sounds like you just like her.  <br>  <br>  It's been 3 years and you still have feelings for her, so i would say there is something special there. <br>  <br>  Talk to her, ask her out on a date.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|jp5lfmzTaa	Thats it. Go ahead.|`|WLLqdPXeaa	If you find some common friend or you are able to make her friend, then it will be wise to express your feeling for her. I hope she will accept you.Aafter that marry her, love her and enjoy her association throughout your life. It is my personal request please ensure that she is happy throughout her life. If it happens because you feel  she is the benchmark for beauty. If you are successful please mail me at sks2709@yahoo.com. May God bless you!|`|FLPRFTccaa	i think mate, you were abducted by aliens from alpha centauri who have done strange mind changing experiments on you. quick, rub the back of your neck to see if they have inplanted a chip into you<br>  <br>  ps Fight The Future!|`|mnasIFdZaa	i kinda do understand. but maybe your creating a fantasy. Your probably thinking about the what if''s. like what it would be like being with her.When you think about it you dont really know her. Most ppl want what they cant have  I sometimes have dreams of this guy i used to like even tho communication between us was very little, after the dream id feel so good, such an odd feelng even though i knew it wasnt real.<br>  Maybe wait till next time you see her.<br>  goodluck :)|`|8qoLtrrwaa	sorry I didn't get it yet but this is only love b'coz love cant appear in a short time, if it appears in short time then its only attraction. You have taken much time so I think u should propose to her. Pls tell her everything honestly, I m sure, she will accept it.<br>  best of luck dude|`|Yc3FVD6naa	Well I wouldn't say you're in love with her, but you've definitely got some repressed feelings for her. Try to approach her one day, and ask her out. If you've liked this girl for 3 years, it's about time you make a move.|`|WjYSg2mEaa	Well its not first time and its not gana be last time that us guys felt like this but dude! Think this way it was 3 years ago ... and something happened! Let me tell you something your life is much more valuable than just sitting and think about somebody THAT EVEN DONT REMEBER YOU, get up your are young you can do whatever you want, I envolved with this kind of relationship when I was on 4th year and be honest I didnt like it, I TOTALY LOVE HER! But Im always telling myself why so soon! I could do everything, So just try to move up your life dont forget there is TONZ of chix out there that has the same dream about you, So dont waste your time LIVE IN TIME... LIFE IS TOO SHORT<br>  <br>  Hope you best Bro

However, there are more important things then looks.|`|lR40HgdEaa	every guy likes different things this question is not fair i am 6'2 and i love a tall girl around 5'7 to 5'11 but hard to come by. shorter men probably would like the smaller girl Just to fit them better. guys have a hard time dealing with  a girl that's taller then them for some reason|`|nXSpS3Axaa	A tall girl with a nice figure..

He was after her for himself, and the fact that he was willing to tell lies about you to get her should speak for itself.|`|EzcQOTPtaa	I would be very angry.

I'm sorry if this happened to you, and maybe try talking to the girl if she's still around?|`|GYoNyoWtaa	I would find this very hurtful. For two reasons, the main reason being that she is my friend and friends shouldn't go around telling your business, true friends are people who you can tell your deepest and darkest secrets to and know without a doubt that what you told them is going to the grave with it. The second reason would be because I would feel very betrayed and wonder to myself if she is ever going to be trustworthy again of things she knows.

You should have known that your cousin is married and the girl that he brought into your house is not his wife.  You shouldn't have them in in the first place and next time don't live.

twWQwax9aa	It sounds like you are having a really hard time at the moment. I think it would help you to talk to someone about it but I understand that you don't think that you could talk face to face. It can be hard to express yourself when your emotions are all over the place. A counsellor would be trained to deal with this though but I'm not sure how you would explain where you were to your family when you had an appointment. <br>  <br>  Parents aren't perfect but your Dad doesn't have the right to treat you or anyone else like that. It must be hard for your mum as well as she will want to protect you but she maybe thinks that standing up to your dad would make all of your lives more difficult. <br>  <br>  Don't let this treatment dent your confidence and your faith in yourself. I know that is hard when you are getting constant criticism but remember that just because your dad says something it doesn't mean that it is true. He sounds like he has control issues and that he doesn't want anyone in the family to have any power but him. <br>  <br>  Remember that you are a good person and that someday you will move out, have a great job and be a happy person. Also I expect your mum is really struggling because unlike you who was born into this situation she actually married and had children with this man. She must have loved him at one point and probably feels trapped in the relationship.<br>  <br>  I don't think that there are any charities in the UK that have email services but if you want you can email me.

I swear to you that it just happens. She said she was nervous and scared, but the guy took the lead and he just took her hand and they were talking for a long time at a bench in the park.<br>  <br>  I asked her like how exactly did it happen and she said "I promise you on my life that it just happens, I know you don't get it, but it just does, don't freak out about it"<br>  <br>  So, my only advice is RELAX dont FREAK OUT and don't feel that pressure to have to do something, just go with the flow.|`|Eucvymfbaa	Ok man. Im 13 too. I just had my first kiss a year ago. It seems hard but its pretty easy. Im the shy type too. All you need to do is stare into her eyes and lean in a little.

I know you can do it!|`|ttgyWGngaa	after flirting with each other for a bit just sort of lean in and go for it.<br>  you'll know when to do it once you're with her.<br>  If you're scared, just tell yourself that you have nothing to lose.<br>  because, really, you don't. you shouldn't be worried if you guys are going out. she'll go along with it.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, just be closer w/ her, and make a move, and plus she is going out w/ you, you should not be worried about a thing.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	ok wait...2 months?<br>  <br>  YES ok, wow ok in 2 months she hasnt dumped you so yeah i think she wouldnt mind that.

27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	no id think its stupid i broke up with him I'm the one who made the mistake i'd be hurt and think what i did was stupid.... if anything i might be mad at the guy for dating someone so quickly ( just give it 2 weeks to let the air clear a tad) and maybe a little anoyed at what you did but id get over it .i know some girls who would hold grudges against you though just for that for example one of my closest friends ended our friendship because she was mad at me for telling her a girl she hated wasnt that bad....people are so stupid sometimes|`|WYEmd9A6aa	Well,<br>  being that girls are the cattiest things alive,<br>  yes I would probably dislike you.<br>  I don't think I would hate you though,<br>  besides,<br>  I'd eventually get over it.|`|VJP1zL4uaa	umm i would deftianly not hate you i would actually tell you to go after it...why should you not be happy becuase someone else screwed something up??? she only wants him bc you guys want eachother...you two should date ..go after him!|`|7AU7GCemaa	Go for it but remember there is a good chance he could end up going back to her and might still have feeling for her but just doesn't want to tell you.|`|8TufRFxIaa	uhhhhhhhhhh duh<br>  ...would u?|`|SybhyB0maa	If you like the guy, date him.|`|xrq4qKRbaa	Sounds like she made a mistake and now it's her problem and your gain.<br>  You owe nothing to the EX.<br>  He is fair game and soon to be yours.<br>  Have fun
SDJ1I8wraa	talk to him about it. ask if he likes u. yea it seems pretty out there but trust me
Bd16ixUQaa	It sounds like you still need some distance from the ex.  <br>  You're finally learning how to be happy without him, which is important.  At the end of the day, we can't count on anyone else to make us happy, that's something we have to do for ourself.<br>  It also sounds like he only became interested once you lost interest- ALWAYS A BAD SIGN.<br>  Also, the fact that he is placing stipulations on getting back together which have to do with your appearance is a REAL RED FLAG.<br>  <br>  So, I would advise you to stay with the new guy for a bit longer and just give it some time to see how the ex actually is.  Does he lose interest quickly? Then maybe he just wanted to feel like he could have you back whenever he wanted.  Does he keep pressuring you to gain weight?  <br>  <br>  Don't rush into anything.  Its easy for people to say things but the question is how to do they do with following through or what happens after some time passes. <br>  <br>  You might even tell your ex that right now you'd like to explore other relationships while you think about whether getting back together is the best thing for you.  If he gives you some sort of ultimatum then I would be concerned.  If he really loves you and is sure you are the one for him, he will try to get you to get back with him but if you are firm about needing your distance he will respect that and WAIT for you to figure things out.<br>  <br>  Last thing, if the relationship stressed you out so much that you lost weight, again you want to rethink whether things will be any different and if so, why or how?  We can't just enter relationships with optimism but no plan.  What didn't work before and how are things different so that the things that didn't work or caused problems won't be an issue now?  If nothing has really changed, then you'll end right back up where you started.<br>  <br>  Even though new guy annoys you, give him a bit more chance, it may be that you're just comparing him to what you had (and remember, our memories of things we miss are always better than the actual thing was, lol!).<br>  <br>  So, follow your head for now to get a better sense of the situation.  If its a good situation for you then eventually your head will line up with your heart.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|18d9aa70c53578f18caa307002ccab93aa	Leave your ex alone. They became an ex for a reason. He is trying to get back with you but is trying to change you in the process. If he love you he would accept the way you are. Do not go backward move forward.|`|289DtjKVaa	i think you should get back with him, give him another chance but make sure his intentions are good, and PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION ON THE EXACT SAME SUBJECT EXCEPT REVERSED, i could do with your opionion, the one on is hanging with an ex a good idea, i could really use your imput!!<br>  <br>  maybe this time apart has finally taught him that you are very important to him... as for the wieght thing i used to do the same not coz i was judging my ex but because i really cared about her and she was so concious about gaining wait when she was beautiful to start with!! i didn't want her stressin so much when she put on a pound or two, so he just cares<br>  <br>  make sure he is serious and tell him this is the very last time this will happen and if it doesn't work out now, it never will, if u go for this new guy you could regret the 'what if' at least if u gave him one last go then you'd be in a good position to say i gave him enough chances, plus if u go with the new guy he may just give up on you and decide that he should move on too..|`|pNvYnP4gaa	i would say that you shouldn't go back together with him. first of all, i learned from experience that sometimes (im not saying that this applies, but im just letting u kno,) guys say that they love u just so u will get back together with them or do something big like move in with them(which i suggest u dont do no matter what your choice is) it is very good that u hav gotten over your ex, as hav i. so i guess we hav the same dilemma. should we get back with our ex?  no. i rlly wouldnt if i were u. and its never a choice between your ex or the guy youre with now. you can always choose neither or even someone else. i would say that he missed his chance and plz w/e u do, dont move in w/him! i hope i helped u. but probably not. =)|`|qg8wDrURaa	When someone asks you to gain a little more weight. He's judging you from the outside, not the inside. Try and pick someone who will be with you the rest of your life and is in love with your inside. Because if you pick men who judge you from the outside and you start getting older. It's those men that end up having an affair with you. Well I wish you luck in your choosing. =) I say that you shouldn't get back with him but it's your call. Again, Good Luck.|`|1hciyvKdaa	As the old saying goes you cant go back. Hes needing a bed mate, thats about it. Your number is on his phone, so hes called you and any other girl hes known. Guys are dogs, remember that.|`|u3gyFKzzaa	I think you should be paitent and let him chase you and see how persistance he is....I'm afraid that this guy is just lost another relationship and now he wants you back....probably, he knows about your new guy and he's jealous.....<br>  and that's not a good thing he told you to gain weight....it looks like he likes your look more than you....what if you get out of shape when you give birth to a baby or whatever comes into your life....then what?<br>  so...I think you got to be cool and see how it will go...don't get to sex with him quickly....it will ruin your current relationship....and it's good that you have one relationship now....then your mind is not after him totallly.....and it's right...when you let him go, he bounced back to you....so don't be afraid if he goes or if you lose him...you lost him once so you survive, you will survive again....and if you two meant to be together then you will....be relax :)
EKRyIAF2aa	If anything I wish I could have determination and motivation. <br>  Belief in myself also.<br>  <br>  I'm failing school and I'm at a critical stage. <br>  I'm failing because I can't do my homework, I don't know why but I think it's linked strongly to depression.. maybe. <br>  <br>  <br>  *sigh* If only things were easy, just pray and things will be fine. ugh. <br>  Thanks for your time anyway, crazy man.<br>  <br>  <br>  Amanda.|`|hxDD9flkaa	Pray for relationship reconciliation with my wife, for months we have been cold to each other.

J7Mmo5Xmaa	Let him go, wait 2 weeks and see what happens.If he is serious, he will keep in contact, if not you'll never hear from him again.|`|dPicgCgwaa	I thnk that remark he made about "looking for a commitment" is his way of telling  you that this relationship is going to be difficult due to the distance, but he's willing to stick with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would really appreciate some more answers on my question:<br>  "girls I need help/advice"|`|jK5qZ1zDaa	Long distance relationships very rarely work out, i say dont get attached to him completely, if its meant to be he will be there for you when/if he gets back. I dont see a reason not to believe him...

Texting is good, though =)|`|KasFZL7laa	well i hate talking on the phone but not because i am afraid of what people will think.  i just hate talking on the phone!  i love to text or talk in person too.|`|x355hpUZaa	your not the only one.|`|7ulpcNi7aa	I do 2 i hate talking on the phone i only text or IM unless its necessary|`|AA10731562	Same here in some cases yes in others no|`|7jNYqtWOaa	I agree with you.  I'm not a talker anymore, either.  I've said everything I've needed to say years ago, why repeat myself?  Texting is quieter and doesn't disturb anyone, and most texts are more easily retrieved over a voice message.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad about not talking all the time.  My husband's the same way.  But when he talks, pay attention as he normally has something interesting to say.<br>  <br>  You will find that most people who have a cellphone glued to their ear normally talk about nonsense.  It's all useless gossip.<br>  <br>  Speaking to someone in person is more intimate.  You can read a person better when you can watch their body language.  The only good thing about talking on the phone is that it's instantaneous AND you could be totally naked and no one would know.|`|IFHzCyOkaa	it's totally normal(:<br>  <br>  i think texting is way easier than talking on the phone too.<br>  it depends on the relationship you have with the person when you talk on the phone.<br>  <br>  cause when you text you can either not answer if you don't want to or you can think of your reply.<br>  <br>  i'm guessing your a little on the shy side? i'm sure you'll break out of it if you are (:<br>  but it's totally normal so don't worry about it(:<br>  good luck!|`|vnpHAV1paa	sure its normal, u hate talking on the phone because they usually end up being pointless convos anyways, I remeber once I spent like 2 hours on a phone with my bestfriend and this guy that liked me and all we did was laugh and he said some awkward things like your hot!<br>  I mean it was just a pointless 2 hours so I see what your saying, it is normal. Not weird one bit.  <br>  <br>  But..to your girlfriend its always nice just to text little things like your beautiful, ily, miss you, things like that always makes a girl feel special and love you just more.|`|hQA8Ql21aa	Perfectly normal im the same way.I text instead.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	sorry.|`|XSnj1sxAaa	Gotta shake ur azz|`|AA11627920	haha.. im the same way.|`|iqShn0UIaa	It's normal, its the same way with me. Don't worry about it, if someone is getting upset over it, just tell them how you feel. You can always work around it, call a little more, or simply drive over to her house, grab some coffee along the way and chat for a few hours.|`|FCLxTDFwaa	I'm not sure.  I HATE phone conversations and keep them as short as possible, even with my boyfriend.  Its solely opinionated and it can be normal for you to not like talking on the phone. Its normal for me, and i'm a teenager!|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	You are going to have to call her some just to be thoughtful. You don't have to stay on the phone for hours.

6JLIMmWYaa	If you can text her, then you can call her!  Hearing from you, and you telling her you are interested in hanging out with her won't be creepy.  She maybe worried about you not calling after you guys messed around, She wouldn't have given you her number if she didn't want you to use it!|`|Di6FAQxRaa	tell her u want to take her out for dinner then drinks at a lounge though not a club.|`|yv3unx5Eaa	Pics are needed in order to properly address the situation.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Even though it's awkard, a phone call is always better than a text.  Give her a call and invite her to somewhere neutral (coffee shop, school cafeteria, that type of place).   A phone call is more personal, where as a text is just as indirect as facebook.    It's well worth the extra effort.

The fact that he is calling, and emailing, are good things!  <br>  <br>  The fact that you all did know each other before the first date sort of cancel out the first date rule, because you kind of were dating during the talking stage.  <br>  <br>  I would see where things go, and remember not to over plan.  Let things happen as they happen.  <br>  <br>  And while it was only a TV show, Carrie slept with Big on the first date.  They had some ups and downs, but they did last 10 years...|`|7519e10677e4f1ca5363e860ade206d0aa	i have a feeling it is a line.... sorry; maybe he just wants more that's all<br>  r u gonna give more in order to find out; a good idea tell him you want him to introduce u to his family; if he dissapears then u got your answer|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	It may be a line, but nobody can know for sure.  We don't know him.<br>  <br>  This is one of those things you just have to work your way through.  Is he going to think that sex is likely now that you've slept with him?  Yes.  But that would be true if it was on the first date or the tenth date.  Once you have sex, you can't close the door on it.  You are now lovers, and it is up to you both to decide if you will continue to be or not.<br>  <br>  There is nothing that says you can't have a healthy and long term relationship with someone you slept with on the first date.  It all depends on both of you, and what you both want.|`|JCdBSULraa	He's using you.  He might even be fooling himself into thinking he likes you, but when a guy gets sex that easily, it's hard to think of anything else.  He probably enjoyed the sex and will keep coming back for it until he finds something better.  Anyway, I wouldn't get too attached to the guy.  He's already enjoyed everything you've got to offer, so there's not much reason for him to stick around.|`|u3gyFKzzaa	wrong thing to do to sleep on the first date....to correct it, you should be relax and not call him all the time....let him to chase you....let him to work hard to get you....and you don't know probably he's looking for a relationship....<br>  There is no rule for love and life....but all the time we are afraid of getting hurt and we are not ourselves.....<br>  so, enjoy your new relationship....but I dont' call him so often....be cool...and see how it goes....and don't tell him that it was a bad idea to sleep on the first date or you are like this or that....let him to find it himself!

p9X6fX3naa	I don't know how much of an actor/ actress you guys are, but think of it this way. When you guy's kiss you where is character, it wasn't you and you bf kissing it was the character you where playing, it was a stage kiss.<br>  Now when you are out of character, its a different story, it's you and your boyfriend, there are feelings and chemistry there.<br>  Also it's possible that you are just expecting too much from any kiss.|`|pjggSVKKaa	k i live in ireland and ere we just kiss (meet we call it) people if we think there gud lookin(hot) i think love has to grow you cant just feel close to someone after one or two kisses u just cant u need to give it a try and u need to spend a day 2gether and see if ye like each other if so den ye have no problems i know that wasnt much help sorry xx|`|S6V53hyvaa	well same here with me i was with my boyfriend for a year i hated when we kissed and were never sexually or anything well just see what happens the first time but i think the problem is that ya'lll cant be forced too kissing jux let it happened dont plan anything|`|ls3TD7Teaa	well you have only been together for a little while, a kiss really has little effect if you are not in love yet. :) good luck:) i hope that i helped:)|`|RvwJcvZDaa	Don't worry about it... When the time is right you two will have your first kiss and hopefully it will be great but, if not your only 15 you will be ok! :)|`|ptOomSE6aa	I'm a pro at boy drama lol. i would say just kiss him beforehand..i know you said you already have but try it again...if you have never kissed anyone before, youmight not feel anything at first.  first kisses are always awkward and messy well not always but if it is you first kiss with anyone, it is very likely.  my first kiss with my boyfriend was gross and kinda turned me off.  I'm only a year older than you and it was my first kiss.  kisses arent always like what you see in the movies. but eventually, you should feel something if you really like him.  movies make kisses look like deal breakers but they arent.  me and my boyfriend have now ben dating a year and things are great!! confusing, i know, but hope that helps!!
XJhOa3Q5aa	Your only young. You have just had a bad start and will meet that special someone when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  I am divorced twice and so is my Husband we re married eachother after 12 years appart. I dont think any less of him for his past.<br>  <br>  If you find someone that is right for you then she wont care either. She will love you for being you|`|GEYRTKuqaa	honestly, that sounds pretty bad.<br>  that doesnt mean that you are a bad person or would be a bad boyfriend, but when a woman hears that you have been divorced twice and you are only 22, then she will definitely think of you in a negative way.<br>  if i were you, i wouldn't tell a woman on your first date.<br>  wait until you're sure she likes you, then tell her. and make sure you explain it thoroughly.<br>  that way she wont just see you as a twice divorced 22 year old man..she will see you as a person with a history, like everyone else.<br>  <br>  about the kid, that wouldnt bother me.<br>  people have sex.<br>  most [i think..lol] 22 year olds have had sex before.<br>  each of those sexual experiences could've resulted in pregnancy.<br>  having a child doesn't reflect badly on you.<br>  how you treat the child is very important, though, obviously.|`|SMRcJVneaa	If it was me you were pursuing, I would be really cautious but willing to try with someone that has a past. Everyone has a past, you know? Not really my place to judge you.<br>  <br>  Now, my advice to you is to be honest with your history but don't do it on like the first date. That might be a tad much. I would suggest, which I'm sure you already know, not to rush into anything. Make sure the next time is the right time. Plus, you don't want a bunch of women around your kid.|`|R6lxaKiEaa	Wow.  I think you have made bad choices and you are a risk taker.|`|abTZX46faa	poor effort pal, women like your type though...|`|uGNJK5zKaa	its not taht uncommon any more but they might think your bad at relationships and if someone didnt know your age and you told them you had a son of age 22 they might think your old but good luck
hE4CXKX2aa	Wow, this is quiet a story.<br>  <br>  Well I am confused at your question / description.  You said love in the question but "really, really likes me"  Well I will answer it as in a love / bf-gf way.<br>  <br>  Well, I would say yes and no.  It is normal to have a crush, but to flirt with is another story.  It is a jealousy rage that could develop in you against the other guys that she does have crush / flirt with.<br>  <br>  But then again, you got to look at yourself.<br>  Are you flirting with any other girls besides her.  If so, stop and show respect to her.  Maybe her actions are a result from your actions.  <br>  If you are not, then she should not be flirting with any guys except you.  It is wrong cause she will send the wrong signals to them saying she is open to a relationship when she is not.<br>  <br>  Just Food For Thought.|`|KjF0p72naa	She may just not be ready to commit. If you're under 25, that is more than reasonable.|`|63tch8D5aa	you may always be her number one,<br>  but shes a girl with needs,<br>  she craves love,<br>  she sees those guys as one dollar bills,<br>  and she goes out and spends them,<br>  but to you,<br>  your her lucky penny.<br>  <br>  as cheesy as that sounds<br>  <br>  she knows she can come to you whenever she wants real attention.<br>  <br>  dont give it to her,<br>  she needs a taste of her own medicene|`|fqn41O7Naa	Honestly girls can like more the one person at a time. I guess she just likes them because of different reasons. If you like her then show her that you should be the one that she goes to dinner with, not those other girls!|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, sometimes some girls could have flirty personalities, you should tell her you feel uncomfortable w/ that, and I thought she will actually take you one for serious & respect it...|`|IKnEeMXLaa	yes, but he probably isn't the one, because once you find him you won't want anyone else.|`|7AU7GCemaa	Sounds like she is still too young to know what love is. You really don't know what love is until you are at least 18 but in most cases it's even  quite a few years after that.|`|PhGwwlg7aa	i don't think so if she really loves you she will not like other guys too i don't know though some people like more than one person at a time but if they do they don't really love them like getting married at least what i think|`|WYEmd9A6aa	nah,<br>  she doesn't know what love is,<br>  I think love is where you like someone so much you can't possibly see yourself with anyone else at all.|`|y03b6F1Baa	I don't think you can called that "love", I think you can find other people attractive or good looking but crushes?..I'm sure that if it was true love this would not be the issue.
QPp7zQQpaa	The Law does not impose a federal decisions about a grandparent's visitation right in any state. It calls for reciprocal recognition of grandparents' rights, but there have been cases where the court has ruled visitation rights for them.<br>  Read this, it will shed some light on your case,<br>  <a href="http://www.grandparenting.org/Grandparent%20Visitation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.grandparenting.org/Grandparen...</a>|`|4PCLUlwUaa	yes she can  so tell the judge your story and good luck|`|X2QUJsUaaa	Sadly, yes, grandparents do have legal rights. However one of three requirements must be available for your mom to tempt to get those rights.<br>  <br>  (1) if either of the child's or children's parents are deceased<br>  (2) if the parents have never married, are married but separated for more than six months, or are divorced<br>   (3) the grandchildren have resided with the grandparents for more than 12 months and then were removed from the home. <br>  <br>  You mom just sounds like a bitty old witch with a broom stuck up her toosh. How you describe your mother sounds like she could do harm to your children. Not physical but mental. She's not very stable, and she cannot even care for her own flesh and blood.<br>  <br>  Record EVERYTHING when your mom contacts you. Have a voice recorder going when she comes over. If she tries (which I know she will fail) you can get the case dismissed before their is any drama. Note what happened during the visit, the dates and times she visited to.<br>  <br>  L|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	few states recognize grandparents rights.  you'll have to check with PA to see if they are one of the few.<br>  <br>  basically, she'd have to prove that she had a relationship with the children and that you were keeping them away from her for no good reason.  <br>  <br>  Check your state laws (google "grandparents rights your state") and then get a lawyer if she takes you to court.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Just tell the courts she drinks alot. <br>  I won't let my kids alone with my mother. One, she drinks. Two, she's crazy. My father will meet me in a secret place, just so she won't be there. if she wants to see them, I have to be there too.|`|651e1ee6ad591c873f721e0ec3f034b2aa	I believe that if the parents are alive the grandparents have no automatic rights.  If a parent dies and their partner refuses contact with the deceased's parents they can take the surviving parent to court but even then it isn't simple.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	Well she could certainly go to court and tell a judge her story.  Chances are though, if she wasn't truly committed to them to start with, she's not going to go through all the hoop jumping to make that happen.|`|BbWk7RNgaa	"Currently, Pennsylvania recognizes the rights of grandparents to seek visitation, partial physical custody, or primary physical custody of their minor grandchildren. The grandparents must prove that the requested custody would be in the best interests of the minor child or children and would not interfere with the relationship between the parent and child."<br>  <br>  If she's never sought contact with your children before, I don't see her going through the trouble to do it through the legal system, so she's probably just trying to scare you.  If you can, you might want to contact a lawyer for legal advice.  Another thing you can do is start recording phone calls you have with her, and otherwise gathering evidence that she is not a good gramma.  The burden is on her to prove that she is, so yr probably okay.|`|wy9rgMGsaa	She is prolly just trying to scare you, or cause more "Drama" to the situation, I know people like this, and they will throw in whatever unreasonable threat they can think of to spice up the arguement....I would guess if she doesnt see them much anyway that she wouldnt put the time or effort into court ,which I dont know about that law, I havnt heard of that, unless you are an unfit mother, which isnt the case, but I dont think ive heard of that one before..<br>  Good Luck, hope things work out with you all
KDW2tANfaa	Well if you're getting dumped then maybe you fall too fast.. liking someone is easy but falling in love should take time and the word shouldn't be tossed around.  If you're doing the dumping, you may be afraid of commitment.|`|bYJc1eTraa	Well, what's up with that bad vibe? Is it just you getting nervous, and you end up subconsciously tearing it down?

It could be a wide variety of things.

Depending on your age group Ive come to the conclusion that its hard to find a girl mature enough to know what she wants and realize that nice guys finish last.

And all these other people are telling you to break up, and you probably don't really want to do that.  But what you can try is just telling him how you feel. That you don't want him to pull you into it, you don't want him to be smoking around you. (only if that's what you feel.)  & just make sure he doesn't do it everyday, and get into harder drugs.|`|gUunILSRaa	WOW SUCKS TO BE YOU;;<br>  =(((|`|QoS8ChCnaa	I had a boyfriend like this last year, it sucks.<br>  Tell him that you are strongly against pot and if he still wants to date you than he should stop...

If he says no, break it up with him, and if he doesn't keep his promise this time - break it off.|`|AA10396759	Weed is good for you.<br>  <br>  Are you sure the picture was from while you were dating?|`|GxYTK7FXaa	I don't think smoking pot is a big deal at all. Just because someone does it does not make them a "drug addict". Just the same as someone who drinks alcohol does not automatically make them a "drug addict". But between booze and pot, booze is far more damaging to the body (breathing in smoke is the worst of pot). That aside, if he is lying to you he is probably just a loser and you deserve better :) <br>  <br>  And to your additional details:<br>  Pot can screw up your life, but really anything can. It does not intrinsically lead to other drugs any more than alcohol or pain medication. Sure, some people who hop on the illegal drug train never hop off and try harder and harder drugs, but I really wonder if it is more likely that certain types of people are more inclined to do harder drugs, rather than softer drugs leading people down a slippery slope to heroin and such.|`|qg8wDrURaa	Yeah, You should dump him. Men that smoke or drink have more chance of abusing there wife or girlfriend.|`|71EgUdXnaa	Thats a doozie<br>  <br>  <br>  I dunno, but if he smoking pot with other girls what else do you think hes doing with other girls...|`|a7LvtYi0aa	thats already a bad sign, him smoking pot with another girl if i were you unless u have really really strong feelings for this guy and you are willing to waste your time to try to get him off pot i would break up with him.<br>   he sounds like the type of guy that says that he will stop tomorrow but he keeps doing it. u should have a serious conversation with him about this and ask him if he really wants to stop smoking pot bc if he does then you have to get him help , im sure there is rehab for that type of stuff. oh u can also talk to a school councilor about it and im sure they will guide you.<br>  good luck =]|`|m0QaQZhLaa	if it took a picture to notice it, wats the big deal?|`|MM8Lb0Ebaa	Well, he lied about that you don't know what else he could be lying about... Try to have an open, honest, understanding conversation with him. Tell him your feelings about pot and him smoking it. It will show him you really care and maybe he will care enough to stop. If not, I say break up with him :/|`|qkUnVwR1aa	ditch the *****|`|W8XAUSTCaa	ask him first it could be an old pic. tell him you want honesty...<br>  <br>  and from there you make your decision.|`|f2a0cc692982532ea8bdc8a3c5bcf815aa	break up with him hes not worth it|`|dccwKbt0aa	yeah dump his ***. he didnt respect u which means he doesnt care about u i hate pot. and i hate potheads thats how like all of my dads side of the family now has missing teeth and there all in jail and homeless and a couple of them killed themselves. mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuhjIviDopAgSRk9ygHRxzHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309170143AAeQHVC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|PxqlZJimaa	I think you should definetly dump him, especially because he promised you he wouldn't.

If he will break that promise, what other promises will he break.|`|BXbnLxNJaa	hey, ok I dont know if this will help but theres things you should find out first.<br>  <br>  -how long has he been smoking pot?<br>  -how often does he do it?<br>  -WHY does he do it?<br>  <br>  you should discuss these things with him and find out if he thinks youre worth giving up pot for, if he doesnt budge you may as well dump him seeing as being against pot will go against the relationship aswell. If you can convince him to do it for at leats a slong as you guys are together than thats ok right?<br>  <br>  dont be so quick to do anything bold, just talk it out and let him understand that this IS a big deal, and to anyone that says pot isnt bad, haha take a look at my friends...|`|aed7tlLcaa	break up if u tells u to get into drugs, n getting high with another girl... hmmm suspicious actitvity|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	break up with him|`|TtMKPBR3aa	excuse me most excellent dudette chick but didn't you promise to love, love and like love him?

You have principles and people who are different NEVER change.|`|529tNpuGaa	Yes. Do break up with him if he won't quit. It may be a bad impression on you. Get away from all that.

Nothing could harm me if he was around.<br>  He listened to me sing "opera".<br>  He told me to believe in myself and be whatever i wanted to be.

8SPoPHL0aa	Hey thanks for answering mine.. so here goes:<br>  <br>  I thought you were my guy for a second.. lmao, your situation is so similar to mine but I'm the girl in the scenario.  Okay, here's what you have to do.. You're not going to like it.. but here it is:<br>  <br>  Ask her.  Seriously.  Because she is probably going just as crazy as you are right now.  Just be like "hey.. so you don't talk anymore, what's up?"  Say something!  <br>  <br>  I'm a freshman in college myself and I know that my second semester got really busy and I stopped talking to my guy friend for awhile (we have the 5+ hour convos every night too lol) and he freaked out and sent me a ton of messages.. So don't scare her off...  She might think you are too possessive or ... well, crazy.. if you send her messages nonstop.  <br>  <br>  On the otherside... it may be because she didn't know how to tell you she didn't like you like you, the way you like her?  Girls, suck when it comes to leading a guy on.  lmao, I say this from experience, and we don't mean any harm.. we just like to flirt. lol  There was a time a guy said he liked me.. and I kind of drifted away from him...thinking it would hurt his feelings less, rrather than telling him how I felt.<br>  <br>  **I think your best bet is to just ask her flat out, why she's not talking to you as much anymore...--She's the only one who can really settle this
tm5GTqbKaa	Wtf is wrong with all those retartds that say "ewww gross".

DO N OT pay for anyhting...let him starve, dont let him take your phone, and dont pay for his way in anything.<br>  <br>  3. bio majors are difficult...but there is no reason he cant work a shift or two each weekend or in teh afternoon each week.  even on campus...that way he can pay for food and such.<br>  <br>  4. when he moves out will you have to pay rent when you go with him?  maybe his saving is keeping you form paying massive rent later on...in that case...id be ok with spending your money.<br>  <br>  5. my bf doenst have a job...but he gets an allowance nad pays for movies and such...we split expenses down the middle as best we can.  its about balance...and abviously your financial balance is off.  tell him that you feel that there is too much pressure to pay for things...and tht he better find a way to pay half the time or your out.  i got over the men have jobs thing because my bf is doing well in school and id rather that and he get a good job later on.  his parents believe what your bf believes...school isa full time job...but he does have some money to pay for things....and that is where i could have problems...if he didnt have that moeny.<br>  <br>  good luck...talk to him.  be understanding that he may not want a job and spends time studying, but explain that if you are going to have to pay rent later on, and he is going to expect you to pay half...then he has to pay half now.  my bf doesn't pay for everything, and i try to keep things even on my end.<br>  <br>  lastly...as for him saying you should save your money instead of getting your nails done or buying clothes...its your money, and you earned it.  BUT...i haven't bought new clothes in months because i cant afford it...dont spend what you dont have. and make sure your saving a little...later on youll be happy that you did.  instead of buying 3 shirts...buy 2 and save te money form the third...it adds up fast.|`|uNul8l0Faa	you need to find a man not a mama's boy, you will regret it if you ever get married to him, I know cuz my daughter married a man like ur boy friend, get away my friend|`|64MfLpwCaa	Nah, A REAL man works an goes to school, Dont take that stop paying for him an his things he will get the picture

For me these tasks take LOTS of thinking.|`|nKEKG0Cqaa	call him and ask him out again.  just put yourself out there.  but don't appear desperate, and if he says no, shrug it off and act like it doesn't bother you.  acting like it's cool then ignoring them makes guys crazy.|`|ZyWMPooJaa	that's tough, but it doesn't matter. see if u can message him again, text, email, see him in person. if he mentioned what hed do for a job u might want to look in those fields. i know it sound stalker-ish, but it isnt. good luck.|`|OIBIqDGtaa	you should go look for him take initiative in this if you really feel that strongly. don't sit around and wait like it will all work out because nothing may happen that way.|`|A2itL7i6aa	yeah you might have another chance, but how are you going to see him again?|`|nCMUA50Raa	omg wow is it really you??? i been waiting for u 2!!!|`|WTdbmaiUaa	well try to find some info as his phone number or email address and yea u make a great couple out of what you said so try doing what i said alright well bye ps what was his name ?????|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	Sweetie if a guy doesn't call or message you he's not gonna. It's been a year and I say he's not into you and move on already!|`|u4FIwBNWaa	It happens.  Its unfortunate for the girl species, but sometimes guys are just nuts!  At one point your just going to have to move on and find new butterfly boys! Good luck!|`|B2X6jhqFaa	Just give it up.  This has no hope.|`|AA11441704	seems you are stuck...........same here.........almost 2-and 1/2 years...|`|2e3741216767a389faecfd74b525fe41aa	STOP !!! I told you it wasn't going to work out between us. You give great head, but I just didn't feel the spark.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	Your chemistry wasn't great at all.  You are, unfortunately, deluding yourself.<br>  <br>  We are capable of incredible self-deception but it is particularly troublesome when it actually causes unnecessary expectations, such as the ones you harbor. <br>  <br>  For your own sake you really need to let this go and move on.  How much longer are you going to make yourself miserable?  It ain't gonna happen, no matter how much you want it to.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	to answer your question i would have to be able to see the future and since i can't do that, i cannot answer your questions correctly<br>  <br>  there is obviously a chance still you will be with him but first things first<br>  <br>  you need to find him and talk before anything else happens|`|a55c24f1dd0dab9bef4e763156dfd053aa	youu could possibly see him again........im not the biggest believer, but  i think fate might be real..........if your supposted to, youu will!|`|cM9DBbgnaa	i can't believe is not butter XD
uGG69oJyaa	Talk to your father and tell him to get his head out of his azz and start being one! <br>  <br>  In Regards to being 15 minutes late. Well you were in the wrong, bed without dinner in my opinion was a little excessive, though the lecture was justifiable.  Curfew is curfew. <br>  <br>  Calling your bro a loser and getting smacked on the back of the legs. Well I can tell you if I called any one of my parents a loser when I was your age I would have gotten a sound beating.  Granted he is your Brother and not your parent and perhaps he should realize the difference. <br>  <br>  If it is a serious problem I would speak with your father, (Politely, and seriously. Dont go off on him) If that doesn't work there are aplenty of kids help lines you can get a hold of at your school.  Te me it doesn't sound like you being brought up,  your being dragged.|`|Pk3FnZ8faa	try to talk to your dad maybe he might do something,|`|42IosGs0aa	Hi, he probably feels like he has to look after you as he appreciates nobody else really does. His way of being 'strict' is probably because he's not been brought up properly himself and is his only way of keeping control of you. I don't know the guy but to me it sounds like he is just looking out for you. If that is the case i would advise that you just show him you are old enough to look after yourself - don't tell him but show him. Once he realises that he should go easy on you... If not then explain to him how you feel and talk about it... that's always a good way to resolve problems x|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	I must assume that you are a girl and I feel for you ether way.<br>     Your brother is covered up trying to live up to your fathers reputation and undoubtley overloaded and then to be saddled with you is tough for him.<br>      For you I would suggest that you follow all of the rules and try to understand that he has a plate full of problems and do your best not to cause his life to be more complicated|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	Nothing for you to do except tow the line and cherish your brother for his love and care..I had two brothers,one my twin and one 7 years older and when i was in my teens,what they said went..I hated it at the time but later realised how fortunate i was...............
XGHLrOklaa	Your in the 9th grade honestly if you didn't feel like this I would be worried.  This is a natural thing that I would say 99% of the population has experienced in their teens.  Your fine you just seem to lack self confidence.  Just quit those voices in your head give yourself a break your body is going through so many changes right now with puberty and all.  But if you really think it's that serious a problem where you want to hurt yourself talk to someone.  I was the same way I was so freaky shy now I can't stop talking.  I'm sure this is just a faze and it will pass.  Good luck to you.
vGh3WsU2aa	That's a great idea if you want the crap kicked out of you.
ISnJu0W3aa	yup me too. not boyfriends so far but all my friends have ended up that way. right now i dont have any friends in town that talk to me. it sucks and i have no idea why it happens like that every time|`|yCkCqFmjaa	It's not inevitable... with the right amount of work, good relationships can last for a long time. But, but you need to realize that you will have times that you disagree, and you need to be able to work that out for relationships to last. <br>  <br>  Also, all good things come to an end eventually... we die, lol, so appreciate what you have while you have it. :)<br>  <br>  God bless,<br>  Secret Agent Bucktooth|`|iYAUq0DWaa	Its never happened me inevitably. The person was a complete yeah we wont say here.Trust meeee it takes a fair bit but you will get over it.Yes it can be completely unfair I know all about that but there just not worth it.Look at how much you have up on that person and all youve got going for you.Dontg be worrying ,here this is a very true statment<br>  <br>  Im an amazing person but I choose not to share it with you <br>  <br>  ;)x|`|fYAZcBbVaa	With any of my friends that are girls I grow tired of them and eventually stop talking to them and replace them. I think it is totally normal. We just get tired of people is all.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	It never happened with my husband and I but I find it happening with friends I make.  I'm not always sure how it happens either.|`|B4kf9jDGaa	yes i always feel that way. ask them why it feels that way, work it out!|`|iNLjKP8Qaa	i used to have a best friend in the world. We were so close and told each other everything, liked the same guys, went to school together, but then we went to different schools and know we barely talk and it feels like the only thing keeping us together is past experiences. I know how you feel.
6074ba9150b4dd8433de8921a00a080eaa	I think you just have some good time management, so that is why you don't feel overwhelmed.|`|aUosbTqqaa	you are not enjoying in you life. your schedule is a disaster. try to find out what you most like and go for it. this way you'll never boyfriend or real friends or get out. get a life. btw. no offense|`|tkieaB3Qaa	lool holly **** ..thats krazy week ...yea i'd say you are busy .. you need to back up before you faint or something from all that stress...unless your hot and everywhere you go its a game cause u have so many toys to play with|`|pS4e5OtZaa	You are so busy you don't have time to figure it out yourself and you have ask other people if you are too busy or not.|`|B4kf9jDGaa	sounds like a good life, but if you get too busy and strained and stressed and you ca n't keep up with your commitments, you should give up a few things(but not church and friends)|`|lwkv7pJBaa	If you have time to go on yahoo answers then no. Your definetly not too busy.|`|wtBx5v13aa	You need to meet our old friend Caffeine he can help you.|`|Vu0rQcoyaa	kinda but if u like wat u are doin then its all good|`|kgmoDIoqaa	Well i think you do have alot of things to do overall in the week.<br>  Many people would say your busy but your really not.<br>  You just have atleast 1 thing to do each day, which leaves the rest of the day clean for anything that comes up. Many other people work for half the whole day then do activites such as yours. Thats BUSY l0l~<br>  But you didnt mentioned if you worked so i cant say your completely not a busy person.|`|AA12196919	I think your school should rethink their policy on being a college prep school.  With words like "cuz" and "n" and "becouse" they are really lagging behind just about every other school in terms of spelling and grammar.  <br>  <br>  As far as you being too busy...if you don't feel overwhelmed, keep at it.  It sounds like you enjoy dance and performing arts so just do what you enjoy.|`|iNLjKP8Qaa	I think you need to take a bit off your back. I was like you once and I feel like I missed out on life a bit. Either quit some stuff or go on a vacation.<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You are fine!...I have watching the schedule of President Barack Obama & he is always busy. He has accomplised so much & is an inspiration to others. So if you feel good that is all that matters. Know that everything is well in your life & it will always be fine.|`|2QpCk8V8aa	you do loads. but it all sounds rather repetitive and 'samey'|`|o80aAQV2aa	If you enjoy everything you do, you don't feel overwhelmed, and your grades aren't slipping, then I would say you have a great life! With all of the things you do, you are bound to go to a great college and get some decent scholarships!|`|uIZDd3y5aa	It doesn't sound like you're busy at all, and you have a routine.|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	sound way to busy to me, but if its good for you then i say stick with it|`|GOSMZMpwaa	obviously not cause you have time to type this long *** question
AA12198711	Actually the best thing she could do for you is tell.<br>  <br>  This is your life, your choices.<br>  <br>   Remember that.<br>  <br>  Your additional comment speaks volumes on your mentality.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Thank God that you have a sister that loves you enough that she is willing to anger you to protect you from yourself.<br>    Drugs kill thousands every year and you are wanting to go there???|`|wohGR1Nkaa	Drugs are not cool.<br>  My dad works with drug addicts and ex users.<br>  He has gone through so much that you would be sick if you heard some of the stories.<br>  When you become adicted to the drugs you try then you will have a problem. Your sister will be the good one here and she will probably save you a lifetime of drug abuse to your body.<br>  Maybe even rape or sexual abuse and manhandlement towards you when you can't afford to pay your drug bill.<br>  Think about it. It's not cool|`|HisG2qnTaa	Your an idiot for wanting to try drugs in the first place. I am sixteen and my life has been DESTROYED before from my parents doing drugs. Trust me, the life of drugs is in a place called HELL. You don't want to go there.|`|adcCJrNxaa	How old r u? <br>  <br>  Someone need to tell on you! <br>  <br>  If you want to try it wait until you are out of your parents house!|`|f03fcffe5bd63918c1809b43b17de7b0aa	This is a stupid question used for getting replies. GROW UP!|`|691f568d8f2bae4946dc182680828141aa	do you not watch tv or the news? do you not see what that crap does to people? why would a smart kid like you want to mess your entire life up and lose your loved ones to try this stuff and probably be addicted right away and then have to go through rehab or worse die from it? why? i just don't understand what you are thinking. if i was your sister i would tell your parents that you are wanting to try these drugs anyway. obviously your parents mean something to you or you wouldn't be worried about her telling them. imagine how they will feel about you after you get addicted.|`|79LdWKogaa	Do you consider drug use acceptable if it were your parents that used? If they were to make you witness their decline, dragging you and your sister into their life of failure. What if it were your little sister, or your children....<br>  <br>  What if our Soldiers, Firemen and Police force were on drugs while they functioned in their jobs? Whould you feel safe? Could you trust those people to protect you? <br>  <br>  Wait till your in College...then find yourself, untill then have some respect for your parents and the family.|`|OhKl0BAVaa	anyone who told you these drugs arnt addicting are stupid. i smoke lots of pot and tho i havent tried to quit i can tell you that just cause YOUR BODY dosnt get addicted doesn't mean you wont. by this i mean you wont go thru withdrawals but you will still continuously piss away lots of money and brain cells to do them. acid NEVER leaves your body, if you ever got an important job or some kind of medical some condition that required you to take a spinal fluid sample you would always test positive for acid even if your a 100. If you want to do shrooms you may as well go pick up a pile of cow S H I T and eat it cause thats where your shrooms are most likely coming from. ex burns holes in your brain meth will rot your teeth out real quick blow.....well blows just real expensive and you can die real quick from an OD. Just say no all together and if you HAVE to just go with the pot and dont tell your sister if you dont want to find out.|`|nhG4hUNAaa	Whats your sisters name, i think i want to marry a very intelligent woman as her!<br>  <br>  DONT DO DRUGS - it starts off with weed then other drugs, u need to feed habits and you turn to crime - stay nice please!|`|uGG69oJyaa	Good for your sister.
ZNhP3mpUaa	no. you NEVER know who you are giving your information to. people can mask themselves by the internet SO EASILY. don't EVER do anything like that. Yes u are getting in over your head.|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	if you are unsure, then don't|`|SIRmkzEBaa	No, I don't think your getting over your head. Just relax.. I honestly think that you shouldn't give your number to him, although, if you would like to talk to him then ask for his number instead, and when your calling make sure to use 'private number' !  If you don't want to talk to him at all, then simply cut all ties off with him, have nothing to do with him. Because there are many other good men out there that deserves you!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, <br>  <br>  =)|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	dont trust anybody unless  you really know them!! actually, even the people you really know could do the same thing so you should be really careful especially this is internet!!
XBKv57u6aa	She thinks you're a dirtbag.|`|vGiXqViXaa	she probably likes you|`|6iCOMx8laa	dude, just talk to her.|`|7mWB7lkjaa	woah, are you sure you want to go out with a girl that just got suspended? hmm.. well if you really like her then ok, but.. dont put too much thought into in until you have more clues on how she might feel about you. good luck!|`|GGEAttkgaa	She probably thinks your weird... you should try talking too her more!|`|zce6nlueaa	she might think your a little weird,<br>  just talk to her a bit more... let her get to know you|`|kOoCya9Oaa	My Magic 8-Ball says " Ask again later"|`|mS1ODTalaa	what do you mean you "ask randomly".  i can only come to two conclusions. Here they are explained as follows:<br>  <br>  1.  you waited for her to come back to school at which point you proceeded to randomly ask people ( not gender specific), " so your that girl".  i can only assume that most girls said "wtf" and most guys reacted by spitting in your eyeball or pulling a chris brown on you.<br>  <br>  2.  you randomly thought of many different ways to ask the same question.  observe:  <br>  the british folk:  I say there old chap, are you she?<br>  Yoda:   hmmm that girl you are<br>  hood rat:  who dat is?<br>  guido:  you her?<br>  spanish: tu eres ella?|`|XrtmT2kUaa	I think you maybe going about it the wrong way. Be direct with her. Ask her out on a date or to a movie. And for goodness sakes, stop looking at her butt and start looking at her face. You don't want her to think that is all to you. Good luck.|`|3u8FeWynaa	she probably like this kid is wierd.|`|uIZDd3y5aa	maybe, you should try talking to her more.|`|cc6UZA2Yaa	Well dwfitnatley no the girl isnt interested. I suggest you dont waste ur time|`|GEsyKBeUaa	she was suspended..prob a bad person<br>  <br>  and y would u go up to her and just be like ...UP IN HER FACE<br>  <br>  kinda rude<br>  thats my pet-peeve....when people tell me things i already know...like "you name is (examlple) Lauren bee"...its like..thanks for telling me..because i had forgot my own name..come on!!|`|e4OWhHP1aa	im thinking that you personally do not believe that you can be with her, bacause you have asked this question. you need to convince yourself that you can be with her. to be honest im not sure abot other people, but i cant really guess what a person is thinking about something, unless i know her personality, or how she reacts to certain things. it sounds to me like you go to a typical stereotyped school, so i can guess that she is "popular" and you aren't. in my school, people don't have "popularity" you have different circles of friends, and nothing more<br>  <br>  good luck though, and i hope that you get with this girl, because iit sounds like you really love her.<br>  <br>  and space monkey mafia. you go and visit britain. if you find a single person who still speaks like you seem to think, i will pay you all the money in the world. that is extremly offensive to me. britain consists of four countries, not 1 city, and londoners haven't spoke like that in centuries.|`|cYw9QRsuaa	OK, from a chick's perspective, there are two possibilities. 1) She actually really likes you and she told her friends and there giggling because they know and she isn't because she's nervous or whatever you want to call it. 2) None of those girls like you, maybe your annoying or stalker-ish or something, and there giggling because they think you like her and are sort of making fun of her for it.<br>  <br>  I know those are pretty much on opposite ends of the spectrum, but that is the truth.|`|fcrSCcSpaa	Well, if she caught you looking at her a** then she probably thinks your one of those "guys". If she wasn't smiling, or dropping any hints for you to pick up on, then, sorry to say, she's probably not that into you. But not all hope is lost, perhaps you can change her mind and convince her your a nice, decent guy. (which I am sure you are)<br>  Hope this helps x|`|ZwsnMTElaa	she could have had a bad day.<br>  she might have not wanted to be bothered after being suspeneded.<br>  if she continues to act the same towards you i think she might not like you :/<br>  but if she starts to warm up to you, you definitely have a chance! :D|`|hV5ctpkEaa	i think she likes u :D if she lukd at u she ways probably admiring u.<br>  <br>  And maybe she told her mates dat she likd u and they all know so therefor they are laughin about it cause u dont know.<br>  <br>  Just talk to her or if your to shy just catch her eye and smile that always makes me melt. Good luck!|`|m3j04Et8aa	she probably thinks you are crazy. lol. no she probably knows u like her and she just likes the attention but shes just not trying to show it. just try talking to her for a while. believe i know because i'm a teenage girl. lol.|`|JS3rK9i2aa	Try and get to know her a bit more i don't think she really knows if she likes you or not yet. Once you've had a proper conversation i think you will both know more.|`|VZ90Erh7aa	Hahaha you fucked up.<br>  If she wasn't laughing then she probably never will be.<br>  Rule # 1 never let a girl see you checking out her ***.|`|PqdYPmzwaa	sorry to say but i dont think she is intersested well at least not yet just keep trying and u might get her attention and just keep ur cool dont make her think u are obsessed with her and just drop little hints|`|SHwuzsPyaa	she is probably thinking about nothing|`|bt3peki4aa	well if u looked at her **** u could b in trouble... well maybe she does though  nxt time u c her go ask her if shes mad at u ...|`|j0aeAUs9aa	she thinks you are intresting if she acts wierd around you then yeah u have hope ;P|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	She thinks your a jerk!|`|eOiAfudfaa	What the hell am I doing tonight|`|GZg0io3uaa	huh!!! she thinks u r a lil weird..
jBpPesehaa	There's nothing wrong with it. If you're attracted to them that's you. We're all different. Go for who you want and what you want. It's what makes you happy.|`|cLad8HuLaa	GO 4 IT CUZ IM 15 N I ALZO LIKE 2 GO W/GUYZ DAT R OLDER THAN ME LIKE 29...SO THEIR SO SXY N HOT!!!!!!!|`|vBcqzMz4aa	Is the sexy thing you speak of, by chance, their money?|`|rALoVUVoaa	LOL Deborah! That's nothing, I think my professor is around 56!|`|HSrBpGqkaa	its very wierd
a23c5f4d1193fc5b119200baa494ab77aa	Hmm I think he's acting like that because he didn't break up with you because you both fell out of love.  It was because of the distant. Maybe he's still not over the fact that you have moved away and have also moved on in life, when he still hasn't. Talk to him and try to find out what's wrong. I'm sure he won't just hate you cause you both broke up. There has to be a reason, and asking us won't help, cause we're not him! so go and talk to him :) good luck!|`|E23s2wSNaa	he hates you cause u were out of his life for so long, maybe he felt like he had to hate u to get over u, good luck changing that|`|HhqKdlIcaa	He may think that your niceness is just a way of trying to get him back, idk. Guys have huge egos and seem to enjoy tormenting girls lol. Not really, but they do think highly of themselves. If there is every any way for you to jokingly say something about being glad that his  is there and you are here, cuz you are just both different now. Or something that way. You don't have to be nice either, that is just to keep the peace with the family. And stop letting him come to your parties if he can't be nice to you, to heck with your parents. You are more important than that. To heck with that idiot that needs to just get over himself!!!!! Girl, you know you can do much better. Seriously!!!|`|zoBcrZjEaa	hi.  have you tried talking to him to find out why? it maybe that he still cares about you and he could be upset that ur over him. men are very strange|`|BohXJpaNaa	try to talk to him, your with his family. If he keeps the same behavior just ignore him.|`|uJeEQn9Eaa	wowe|`|VLyQbTH6aa	He might have some unresolved feelings for you. I'm not saying that he does, but it could be the case. He also might feel as though you left him. Some guys are just like that. I hope everything gets better for you.
NrbLdZzOaa	Sorry that you are feeling depressed, I know the feeling. Just know that there will be MANY more guys in your future that you will like. Don't let a guy ruin a friendship, because while guys come and go, those close friendships should last a lifetime.<br>  <br>  If you ever need to talk, let me know.|`|In6t9yiRaa	You guys are friggin serious...?<br>  <br>  really, what does it matter?<br>  <br>  ahh I don't wanna deal with this bull again..!|`|YYdtd47baa	You can tell your friend that that wasn't very considerate, but yeah she did see him first. I wouldn't do that to a friend though. Ask him to go to the movies with you... it's not like they're full-on boyfriend and girlfriend, right? Ask your friend, another friend (other then the one that asked him to go to the Sadie Hawkin's dance with her) to come to the movies, and have him bring a friend, it would be a fun group date thing. Not pressured or anything. Maybe, it's quite possible that this guy you like will turn out to like your personality better then your friend. No reason to be depressed, i'm sure your life is good. Considering you have a computer, that's probably yours since you posted that you throw up when you're depressed.. About the throwing up, you can stop. You need to control yourself. You wont get anywhere with this guy if you can't even manage yourself. Start with helping you - until you can fix you, I don't suggest a boyfriend. Once you are better mentally, (take up running/jogging it's good for the mind, and body) physically, and emotionally, you'll be ready for guys. Hope all goes well.<br>  Izy|`|fOQ2TDIeaa	Well that's the thing about friends, you usually like all the same things,including boys. Try not to dwell on it, there are going to be plenty of other boys in your future,trust. Try writing a letter about your feelings and then ripping it up, when you rip it up...let it go.|`|6efeieoRaa	i know that your talking about us!!!!!! STOP TRYING TO DENI IT!!!! like seriously, your making me mad now!!!! were just going to Sadie's not a big deal....... and you shouldn't keep making yourself throw up for some stupid guy,, like how may time do we have to go thought this stupid situation!!!!!!!<br>   if you like him then fine!!!!!!!!! WHATEVER!!!!, THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT EVERY GUY IS GOING TO LIKE YOU BACK SOOOOOOOOO CALM DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, AND FIRST OFF, YOU BERLY EVEN NEW HIM UNTILL I TOLD YOU WHO HE WAS!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ( didint want to sound harsh sry, but im like really, really, really pist off right now!)|`|B4kf9jDGaa	find someone to talk to when you feel like throwing up. it will be hard to get over him, but whenever you see him do your best not to stare at him, and don't think about him 24/7.|`|uajxQyEVaa	I think you should talk to your friend about it. And you'll find a new guy to like soon enough, so don't worry about it. Find alternatives for dealing with depression. If it's nice out where you live, take a walk. Or listen to a song that totally pumps you up or even escape to a favorite movie or book. Also, call a friend and just go out and do something fun and have a good laugh.|`|DLfra6Btaa	I think you should see what happens between this guy and your friend, and maybe find someone else, because if things don't work out between your friend and this guy, it would be harsh on your friend for you to ask him out. also he could be trying to get to know you through your friend, so cheer up a little and really he is only a guy x

SIRmkzEBaa	Well how was your relationship with your best-friend before you knew he was gay? It was pretty good right? What if YOU had a situation like your friends one, then what? Wouldn't you want him to support you, be by your side, understand you? Yes, right?<br>  <br>  Try to understand, <br>  him being gay shouldn't change the fact that he's your best-friend. He's the same person you knew before. Try to reason with him, talk to him about how you feel about his sexuality. And don't act awkward around him, your just going to make him feel like he's a non-human or something. Remember he is a human, and he is your best-friend. Be the better person, and the great friend you are and stick by his side, as you know..he would do the same for you!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  =)|`|YYdtd47baa	I think that you're probably the reason why he has held off telling you. There is nothing wrong with being gay, do you know that you can't control it? Just like I can't control being straight - i'm guessing you too. That's like him being shocked that you have a new date with a guy. It's stupid. You need to lose your prejudice, he is and has been your best friend. He's always been gay and you just didn't know it. Same guy, no difference. You have to get over it. Wait - but there's nothing to get over. It's your own problem.<br>  Izy|`|KwTPk85Iaa	If he is your best friend and you care about him you'll learn how to accept it. Perhaps you "don't like gay people in general" because you really don't know any. I suggest checking out PFLAG or their website, and perhaps they can help you accept your friend. That is, if you really care enough about him.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Come on, they are your best friend for a reason, and not because of their sexual preference. Get over yourself.|`|Z7cfs3MSaa	don't worry! one of my best friends is gay, and i had suspected it for a while.  but you Just have to get over it.  It doesn't change who he is, he's just more...flamboyant than other guys.  but really, gay guys make the best friends.  they are the the best combinations of girls and guys.|`|G1T0dCjaaa	why don't you like gay people? there is nothing wrong with them. they are people just like you and me. <br>  <br>  just remain his friend and you may find yourself with one of your best ever friends.<br>  <br>  if your too shallow to give him a chance them he deserves more than you, especially if trused you enough to tell you.|`|fGWoRqiRaa	well... if u really think that he is ur best friend then dont worry about it just make sure he doesnt hit on u or anything cuz thats just a bit werid but go with what u feel is right.....|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	If you are fine with it then fine.  If not then don't be his friend anymore.  I suspect he could do without a homophobe.  Except that - he is no different really is he?|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	Then you have to ask yourself if what you have is a real friendship. Being gay has not changed the person; just your perception of that person. The fact that you were friends before you found out; goes to prove that maybe your perception of gay people was misguided.
15kiWTGQaa	you sound like you already made up your mind. The thing I would recommend is getting some hard proof of exactly how your mom is treating you. Get like a tape recording or something of all the things she is saying. Emotional abuse can be pretty hard to prove other wise. You have to do what is best for YOU. Call your grandparents.<br>  <br>  good luck

A friend of mine has to break every contact with a man that just doesnt understand that the diagnosis (he is a doctor - not a good one) false the first one prevented him from doing anything about the second diagnosis. he cannot go and tell the patient the truth and to deal with the diagnosis herself just because he misdiagnosed her the first time so now she has to do it herself. Too late for that now. Can they work this out? No. Unfortunately, it is not her destiny to get rid of her diagnosis this time. Wrong doctor, wrong diagnosis, wrong treatment. Next time maybe. He just has to live with it. Pushing her further, stronger when he realized what he did, he just made the "illness" worse.......She thinks she is not sick, anyway, so he can relax. And take a walk.|`|qM9tSVd8aa	he might be a stalker but if u have a feeling he is going to do something do something quickly|`|rqNb6FIraa	Tell him to butt out before things get worse! This can only escalate if you allow it.
DzC9Mj4zaa	sweetie i know you might think its wierd gettin advice from a guy but im gay and i go through this with my friend courtney.  1, his friend told him "i dont kno what u see in her" that means he told his friend he likes you. 2, your not botherin him, he likes bein with u so ya. 3, just give it some time, he'll come through. and most of all honey, try to talk to him when he is not drinking|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Tell him how you feel!!  You'll never know until you ask!|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	chances are he really likes you<br>  and drunken words are sober thoughts<br>  talk to him and say you want to hang out with him<br>  and when you do hang out with him tell him you are starting to like him<br>  Dont pussy out, if you really like him then go for it.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	he probably likes you, flirt with him and see if he asks you out<br>  maybe he is also scared because you are older so maybe you should make that first move|`|mapqQDrMaa	aww it sounds like he likes you but he dosent know if you like him i think you should give him a call sometime this week and ask if you can come chill with him, not just your friend and see what he says|`|CaqdDzQZaa	just tell him how you feel and go from their if it was ment to be you be happy about it i  know i couldn't just keep wondering about what i should do|`|bnjjeBLYaa	I don't think you ruined your chances. It probably hurt him a little because it sounds like he likes you, but I think he would understand. Just try to hang out with him sometime soon and talk to him more often, like on IM or something like that. <br>  <br>  If you don't go to the same school, it makes things tough. Just talk online and get a little closer. It really does sound like he's into you.<br>  <br>  Some guys feel a little weird when you say you like them, so maybe ask your friend to hint that you like him. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|sg9ET4vkaa	I think  that you should just give more obvious hints that you like him. Think about what you would like him to do to you. Wouldn't you like him to contact you more, compliment you, hold your hand etc.<br>  Maybe next time you see him you should do that to him, compliment his eyes, or his smile, or tell him he looks good in what he's wearing. Let him know you're attracted to him. <br>  Try to hang out with him more because the more you get to know him the less nervous you will be.<br>  I mean if he already says he misses you and is excited to see you again then that should let you know that he likes you.<br>  And even if he's talking to other girls, that is what dating is about, getting to know people. <br>  You shouldn't be worried about that other girl, have confidence in yourself. Just try to present and promote all the good qualities about yourself to him and hopefully he'll like you better than the others.<br>  Once you guys have dated for a while, then you both make the decision to be together exclusively and then he shouldn't be talking to other girls romantically anymore.
BKr3y30maa	There are many women out there that are only looking for a model type boyfriend.  They aren't concerned if he disrespects her or treats her like garbage.  They have it in the back of their mind that they are attractive and they deserve to be with someone that is equally attractive.  I'm not saying all good-looking men are horrible people, all i'm saying is this: I would hope that you would want to be with a woman that will love you even when you are 70 years old, just like you would love her,  because let's face it, our bodies don't stay the same way forever.<br>  <br>  Then you have a different scenario. The beautiful woman that is with the less attractive man.  This causes all of these "model-type" men to wonder "what the hell is wrong with her....i'm way better looking than that guy!".  Little do they know, that beautiful woman is with that man because he respects her, treats her right, has an amazing personality, a good sense of humor that has her laughing all the time, and a good heart.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question....it definetly depends on the individual.  Some women may not find you attractive, while others do.  Let's pretend i'm a supermodel.  I couldn't imagine spending my life with a man just because of his looks.  Would we have similar interests and be able to hold a conversation for more than 5 minutes?  What if he abused me or cheated on me?  If you ask me, a sense of humor is sexy. So is a man who is smart and independent....who knows what he wants in life.<br>  <br>  Well i'm done rambling on now.  You have gotten alot of great answers.  Hope everyone has shed a little of light for you.  Keep your head up and be patient, the right girl is out there somewhere.|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	it all depends on the woman. Some go for looks. Others go for personality. but i personally believe that there has to at least be some physical attraction there in order for two people to get together. but it all just depends on the woman and what she is looking for. Some women (like myself) are very picky|`|16vMIGPiaa	It's my experience that women are most attracted to guys that treat them well.  If you're interacting with young women, don't fret too much.  Young people are still all about hormones, and most don't really know what they want.<br>  Is it all about looks?  Appearance sends an important message no matter what your age.  If you take care of yourself, you will attend to your appearance.  But once you've got neat and clean and nice smelling covered, you've done your bit.|`|7BJ0YScwaa	Not 100% sure what you're trying to say but yes, it's about looks. If you're not attractive you will not get a quality man. I have a cousin who is a wonderful mother, a great person with a sparkling personality and 300 extra pounds and she will never find a non-abusive man. And as much as I love her, I can definately understand why a guy would never touch her. It's not a difficult concept. Drop wieght, put on makeup, dress better and bam! you got a man. Just do it and stop wasting time trying to find shortcuts around it.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Looks don't play such a big part when a girl chooses a bf. Just think of all the ugly old men who have beautiful young girlfriends.... Money definitely helps if you're not good looking but you don't really want a gold digger anyway. If a girl likes your personality you will look good in her eyes. For a girl it's much more about personality. Also remember we all have different tastes.... Brad Pitt might be good looking in most womens eyes, but not ALL women think he's that good looking.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i don't believe in that statement. as a woman i do believe personality comes first than once looks. looks will go when you get older but not personality and that is the essence of who you are and that what makes you, you. if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you would want to find someone personality that suits you, not their looks.|`|fF2CjtbPaa	look <br>  maybe people look at looks for first time when they meet a person <br>  but slowly and slowly when his personality unfolds and suppose his personality is not good then what is the use of looks<br>  <br>  personality is more important than looks .<br>  people would love to talk to you if you have good personality<br>  if you have looks but your personality is foul then people will soon start to avoid you <br>  but good personality will surely give you better and loyal friends and probably better love|`|MeOG2TPHaa	hey lee<br>  you answered my question about the guy at the house party. thanks. now your question. sometimes its one of those things or a combination or an order in which attraction reveals itself. eg. it could be instant attraction, attraction followed by personality or vice versa. with ladies, like men i suppose, it depends on the individual and the circumstances. some girls are shallow, some not, some first find attraction in personality followed by looks, or looks then personality. its hard to generalise this. <br>  <br>  but everyone first notices and can be attracted by a striking face. its inevitable. <br>  <br>  but what you've said about what people say to you, isn't offencive and it seems you didn't take it that way any way. but its not necessarily that you are unattractive, maybe unattractive to that particular person. you know what they say, each to there own. <br>  <br>  so its not all bad. maybe you arnt strickingly attractive, maybe average. thats what i think of me. but in anothers  eyes you can be the most beautiful thing. <br>  <br>  one thing i can tell you, a few guys ive liked in the past happened in different ways. one guy would pester me annoyingly and i couldnt stand him because he got me into trouble when i was at school. to me at the time, he was not attractive, but slowly all the attention he was giving me, like joke about stuff, pick on me cheekly etc, made me like him, and that came through personality and eventually found his looks attractive. i then later discovered, he was adord  by all the girls and was popular. see it shows how much i noticed him. hahaha! <br>  <br>  the guy i like now, i met at uni. but his was more of an instant attraction on my half. when we talked for the first time, he laughed at my joke and smailed looking into my eyes, it was the smile that im never going to forget. it was warm sweet caring and affectionate. but with that i like what minimal knowledge i have of his personality. and because he is shy, its his vunrability that attracts me to him. beacuse he is shy and trys to hide what he feels, but just cant coz he cracks under the pressure of it all.  <br>  <br>  it may sound like ive gone off track, here haha, but my point is, physical attraction and personality come by in defferent ways. what you find attractive about some one, may not be the same as the person next to you. <br>  <br>  so dont worry or dwell on it too much. because some one will like some thing about you that you might not have ever thought. so keep being you, keep looking the way you want, because we can only be who we are. and some one is going to love you for that.<br>  <br>  tc..<br>  <br>  i will mail you to. <br>  :)

AbB3zdYwaa	Ok, I'll answer your question:<br>  <br>  EVERYONE DOES THAT.<br>  <br>  I did the exact same thing to this guy when i was in 3rd grade, I'm all "I hate your guts! Get out of my face!" but I really liked him. Now, I truly hate his guts. <br>  <br>  Then there's this guy currently in my class who went to my summer camp and acts like he hate me but he's totally in to me.<br>  <br>  Anyway, everyone does that when they like someone because they're embarrassed about whether or not the other person likes them. Now i just act how shy I really am around guys I like :) .<br>  <br>  Anyway, I did my little stunt when  I was I don't know, 7 or 8. If he's like around 12 and 13, he's just VERY shy. If he's around 16, he's not man enough yet.<br>  <br>  But here's a trick to find out if he's into you. <br>  1. Does he like to talk to you?<br>  2. Does he blush a bit around you?<br>  3. Ask him. If he says yes, it's true. If he says no, he'll blush and get kind of angry. Totally a sign of Y E S.<br>  <br>  Please answer my question!

Usually when a boy likes a girl he comes to her and uses pick-up line. So just keep on living. You will find better guy then him trust me :D|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	well, i take it you're a younger girl, and YES, MOST boys do do that, they act mean to the girls they like....as you get older you'll see some boys never grow up, but the men out there will show you they like you, and try to sweep you off your feet|`|RAtShC83aa	Boys are actually quite easy to read.  Here is the key:<br>  <br>  If you are hot, then they like you.  If you are ugly, then they don't.  (Although, if you are ugly and give BJs, then they will tolerate you)<br>  <br>  Easy-peesy!|`|3B9Tvq5xaa	Some boys have diffrent ways of showing there feelings jus like girls he jus had a weird way of showing it in the future if someone is being weird jus ignore them|`|kNqS12qwaa	my girl who adores me still acts like she hates me and we are together lol thats normal what he does he wants to hide the fact he likes you so thats why he acted like that|`|1uzNfAcpaa	lol every guy is different XD and has different ways of showing how they feel about you|`|1uG7vH1faa	no girl understands guys, they hide their emotions to seem tough, they have no clue what girls want so they do what every other guy does.|`|YKl4t7vZaa	He was just an idiot|`|FsEK3Ueeaa	all of them, i know im not normal but i think(not beging big headed) but i think i respect girls quite well :)|`|gZZquLafaa	Yeah boys confuse me!... sooo much! some of them can be normal! i hope... haha Xx|`|SMxKzQcbaa	nope maybe that was the only way that boy could act|`|mKOGQVbnaa	all of them except the one that tell you that they like you.|`|Idg2ME9Caa	some boys are just stupid! they're not all like that|`|PXN7r0RRaa	girls are even stanger than guys.. why u complaining|`|ulUBv22eaa	nope tht guy was just stupid|`|AA11634899	i am also one example...but to tell the fact its a kind of fluff and retreat technique.be cool...there is nothing wrong.i think he is afraid of u like me.

AA10952386	Why can't he have you? Are you a minor, still? If not, then it's not an age thing - because 3 years isn't that much of a difference (I've dated 7+ years older).<br>  I think he's simply unsure about whether he wants to be with you. If he cared about you, he would put his issues aside and go for it with you without any excuses. Something just doesn't sound right that a guy cops out on you because ha can't "handle" it..Tell him to grow a pair!
oxLUr8b7aa	If you two really like each other it doesn't matter. Of course you could try dropping hints like saying to somebody to tell this guy that you would totally go out with him. (if that didn't confuse you) or just ask him out. that can totally work. I know alot of people who have asked their current boyfriends out. just give it a shot. Don't be scared to confront somebody you truly like.|`|Q56ymRniaa	no, you should never ask the guy out. That might seem obsessive and that can freak a guy out. The best thing to do is get one of your friends to give him your number. That way he can text you. If that fails then get his number and text him whats up or start conversation with him!<br>  I hope this helps good luck<br>  :]<br>  -Meighan|`|mRZ6Z1O3aa	ASK HIM! <br>  Don't wait around for him to ask you.<br>  If he's shy ask him in a cute way,as if you are too.<br>  Write it down on a piece of paper with a little heart at the bottom. :)|`|p9QndBScaa	Its 2009 ask him already|`|AA11231094	2009 baby go for it.|`|SnWZusBIaa	Just ask him out.|`|VG2V2EbGaa	u should ask him out =)<br>  if u already know he likes u, u have nothing to lose!|`|cfJywdN2aa	Yeah ask him.|`|jKCtxs5Uaa	Just go for it and ask. whats the worst that can happen if you to obviously like each other?|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	You appear not to have shyness as a problem.  There are no rules but you should consider how you think he would feel about you if you did.  If there is not a problem there, ask him.|`|BO28Mn8haa	2009! ask him|`|2KDwEEj9aa	Yes, that's perfectly fine.<br>  Or you could sort of hint towards him asking you out.<br>  Just say, so when are you going to ask me out then? ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  It'll give him a boost.|`|AA11170671	It makes me feel real good when a women ask me out. I would say go ahead and ask him out.|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	Why do you have to put labels to things?  Just keep it rolling and see where it goes.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	LOL, It's official world, they LIKE each other!<br>  <br>  Just ask him out.
oA8Rtyxuaa	MAC does a great job
lKyL5Josaa	when she says she wants a break call her all the time.<br>  she doesn't tell ppl she is single because you will get back together<br>  the other girl thing no clue<br>  sounds like she wants a lot of attention from you<br>  have fun!!
Hjo3lN7zaa	Well obviously your parents and family are in denail about this (which is not uncommon). So, you have to take control now of this situation yourself. Next time you catch him looking at your parts, call him out! I'd say something like, "what are you doing, are you having a good look!" The more you show that you aren't afraid of him the more that he will see your strength and he will back off. Even if you are very shy or whatever the case, you have to do something like what I said or something else to show him that you are not afraid of him and you are confident and a strong person. These types of people attack people who are weak and are vulnerable. I know you can be strong and do this!|`|4U7xhg1Laa	Sweety, that is serious, you need to make sure that you are NEVER alon with him, make sure you NEVER put yourself in that position. You need to sit down with your mom and discuss this, tell her to watch him, maybe she'll see him looking at you.<br>  <br>  Dont suffer in silence, dont keep it to yourself.|`|601gOwNnaa	I would keep telling anyone who will listen.<br>  <br>  If he touches you, take legal action.  Do not let it get to this point, please!  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're in such a bad situation.  Although you're getting to the age where you may be able to stay home and away from Uncle Pedophile.|`|uMv0mqZpaa	YOU CAN GET DOWN WITH THAT FOLK G^ANG^ & G^ET YOUR RANK UP, THEN YOU G^ET SOME G^OONS & HAVE THEM WHOOP THE DOG **** OUTTA HIS *** LIKE HIS A SLObK OR SOMETHING|`|HisG2qnTaa	When he does it tell him to stop really loud. It will attract a lot of attention and then he will think twice about ever doing it again.|`|g7sZ8elHaa	Wait till hes asleep and cut out his eyes.|`|Ppev4EAJaa	i would go !AHMMMM!  (aka clear my throat)really loud but thats just me... im really sorry about your situation.|`|691f568d8f2bae4946dc182680828141aa	that happened to me too with my moms boyfriend and she didn't believe me either so the next time it happened i embarrassed him and asked him in front of everyone, why he keeps looking at my crotch and called him a pervert. i told him i would call the cops on him and then he never looked my way again. my mom was a little pissed but i didn't care. you have a gut instinct for a reason. god put it there. you use it no matter what anyone else thinks. protect yourself anyway you can. best of luck to you.<br>  p.s. never let him touch you at all if you feel uncomfortable.|`|hBmafVYoaa	This is not your fault in the slightest, first things first, TELL EVERYONE. You need to do everything in your power to let everyone know. Tell a teacher, social services and the police. <br>  <br>  Take care|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	You have told the family so allow them to see for themselves.<br>     While there don't be caught alone with him if he appears to be the same way|`|3EXmT91Haa	Talk to ANYBODY, like your school counselor. he/she can help you. Tell your parents and tell them what REALLY happend. If you have to go stay away from him. if he keeps to do it take legal action|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	If you are in public (with your family) I would ask him politely but loud enough for others to hear to please not stare at you because it makes you uncomfortable. Hopefully he'll get the hint and so will his wife.....|`|4PdcTUCQaa	maybe you are over exaggerating? elaborate when you catch him looking at you and what him 'touching you all over but getting him to stop' was|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I think ArtMom has the right answer.  Speak up.  When everyone is around, tell him in front of everyone that you don't like being oogled.  It makes you very uncomfortable.  The fact of the matter is, this is a form of sexual abuse.  It's not nothing, despite the ignorant comments of some on this page.  Speak up every time it happens.   Also maybe you could stay home this summer.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should open this page on your computer and have your mother read it.  Maybe then she'll get it.|`|KTLGIe8yaa	If he touched you, then to me, that is regarded as harassment.<br>  You need to tell your folks about this and be serious about it. They shouldn't just dismiss something like this without a thought.<br>  You need to tell them everything and make them listen. Make sure they know that it's made you upset and uncomfortable.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Ok .... <br>  <br>  Try talking again to your mother ... ask her to watch when the uncle and you interact .... You mom loves you and will watch ....<br>  <br>  If it looks like he wanting to raid your cookie jar.... Mom will cut his little finger off.....<br>  <br>  Good luck, think fast and enlist those who love you to look out for you.|`|wohGR1Nkaa	Let him know you know this. <br>  If you see him looking look at him and say excuse me. <br>  And walk away.<br>  Wear a towel at the times you can or a sorong<br>  If you catch this then you should just say your my uncle and I don't apreciate being looked at.|`|8bFgKg99aa	set a camera in the room and get him on tape, then show it to the family, and if they continue to act the same way show the tape to the police and get a restraining oder against him.|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	www.childhelp.org<br>  <br>  It's sexual abuse. You've tried your family. Now try outside your family.|`|gRXy66dOaa	Well, dont be near him<br>  <br>  This is not right*|`|4TtPUHwzaa	what a Bast*rd?<br>  Most Men are Pigs!|`|AA10408209	The people you are talking to may be in denial about your uncle's behavior because they are in denial that he would be capable of doing this. I mean you have to keep telling people because the line has been crossed if he has actually touched you in inappropriate places. My advice would again to be persistent about it and to tell your family especially your parents that this is not something to take lightly and that you are really hurt by this. In addition, I would ensure that you are not around him alone at all if you do have to go. Otherwise, I would try my best to avoid seeing him altogether. Good luck and Take Care :)
2gb6zN1raa	This is a very serious situation and i am astounded and saddend to hear your family has told you you are exaggerating - it is not uncommon for family members to deny or not want to hear these things .. <br>  <br>  Given that you have tried to talk to your family, you do need to talk to someone for exactly the right guidance - a professional - not people on here as it will confuse you .. call the childline number and although you may feel uncomfrtable answering there small questions , you may find you also feel relieved and more knowledgable about how to handle the situation:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.childline.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.childline.org.uk/Pages/defaul...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lifeintheusa.com/community/childabuse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifeintheusa.com/community/ch...</a><br>  <br>  If you need help or have questions about child abuse or child neglect, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453) then push 1 to talk to a counselor. <br>  <br>  ensure that you are not left alone at all - with your uncle in the same room - not even for short periods of time .. good luck you and well done for talking a bout it ..dont let your family think you are wrong for saying s omething - have faith that you are a brave, perceptive individual x|`|7z9eKO2maa	i'd wear the most layers you possibly could, pretend you have a fever and stay in bed... if your parents come check your temperature, relax all your facial muscles and focus on your forehead, that will heat it up. or you could refuse to go and chill with a few friends. last is you could talk to him about keeping his eyes to himself with other adults in the room|`|u7KqSCs2aa	talk to a school counselor, talk to the cops, take self defense course, get pepper spray as soon as you are old enough, never be alone with your uncle just stay around your parents, and don't wear things that are going to be slutty.|`|pJ7OFWknaa	tell your uncle if he touches u, looks at u, or even has the smallest thought of touching u, u will tell your parents. if and when u go this summer make sure your parents are around when your uncle is. im sorry to hear this though.|`|GW4M0U9Uaa	wtf thats not good you should telll him to stop|`|4j2P6YFhaa	gosh yes i see the problem. if i were you i would steer clear of him. when you say "Last summer he practically touched me all over" do you mean sexually? if you only see him every summer, since they're not listening, i would tell your parents that you will be avoiding your uncle this summer. perhaps you could invite a friend so you can go off and do your own thing in the day and in that case it will be an excuse to not be around your uncle. or, you could ask a friend if you could stay round their house whilst your family goes away. the only other option is to go there and if your uncle stares at you or touches you, tell him sternly that you've had enough of this and you are not comfortable with it, and please could he stop. maybe he just needs to realise that you are noticing, and then he would stop.|`|NGBtHLR2aa	It is very common practice and it is also common for modern parents to ignore such things, as your parents do. In our families girls/women have dress code which does not encourage such things. Moreover males and females keep some distance from each others.These are the problems of modern liberal world.The saddest thing is that your parents are not standing beside you. Consider a simple and practical advice. Wear clothes that do not show the form/shape of your dody. My experience is that when a lady wears modest clothes men are discouraged from staring in an inappropriate way. But U have to guard/defend yourself at any cost.U should not allow anybody from violating U. God bless U and give U courage.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Don't wear anything revealing.  He has NO business touching you.  Tell him to stop, if he doesn't go to your parents and tell them you are going to report him.|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Sounds like your uncle is a child molester.
OfmvrCY9aa	The reason why I ran away when I was 12 because my mother didn't let me have my freedom!!  But now i regret it because I know she was stressed out and sad.  I made her cry and I did all kinds of stuff until I got older I realized.  Sometimes you just have to let that girl learn from her own mistakes.  You should tell her don't runaway if you want to do something or go out to sleepover your friends house just tell me.  Let her do things she want.  And be open and cool.  It's better knowing what she's doing and letting her do what she wants than forcing her not to do things and scolding her which makes her hide and runaway.  But before anything just bring her to the doctor to get checked up for a papsmere and put her on the pill or any other type of birth control.  Because I lost my virginity when I was 12.  Ask her in a nice way if she's having sex and tell her your okay with it and tell her you'll help her.  Don't worry she'll realize when she gets older and starts thinking partying and having fun ain't fun no more.|`|SQApfrsyaa	I wish I had her problems growing up.<br>  <br>  My father was a drug addicted alcoholic who beat me and my mother every day. I was forced to sell crack by age 8 and carried a gun for protection. I saw my father kill a man at age 5, when I asked him why he said "take a good look at what will happen if you ever steal from me". My parents were both dead by age 10 and I lived in a crack house till I was put in a Juvenal detention center where I stayed till age 18. So tell her to get off the pity pot and grow up.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	i am a teeneage run away, hehe. it doesnt matter what my mum sais or does, im nt gna listen to her, i dnt like her end of. lol<br>  <br>  x|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	all teenage runaways are in denial about something or wanting things that are inappropriate for their age unless there was violence or sexual abuse|`|Hjo3lN7zaa	Well...I didn't run away physically, but I ran away emotionally/mentally from my parents.<br>  They were on such a different palne then I was, that I had to detach myself from them, before they sucked me into their own closed-mindedness (even though I knew they'd never suck me in).<br>  The "single action" that my parents could've done so that I wouldn't of distanced myself (emotionally) from them would of been for them to just see reality for what it was.

I know what he would say to this girl....how much does she like being beaten and raped? That is what happens to 13 yo girls...what too fat...not for long...she'll be beaten and starved and then raped.  <br>  <br>  If she is that unhappy...then deal with it.

yAQJlblpaa	You really need to review the relationship you have with this best friend on yours. Are you positive that she's your best friend? I mean if she was she would drop that guy in an instance for being horrible to you. Then again love can make you do silly things. You just need to be there for you when this guy breaks her heart,if he's as bad as you say he is it will probably happen sooner than you think.|`|AA10952386	Sometimes it is not our place to teach our friends the best decisions in life. Your best bet is to NOT be around this guy and let your friend learn by herself what a loser he is. If she loves him, perhaps he will eventually meet her parents and they won't like him either - and she will have to respect her parent's wishes about someone who is disrespectful to them.<br>  <br>  There is only so much you can do other than stay clear of the two of them. If you have to see them at school, go somewhere else and keep to yourself. When your friend learns on her own how horrible he is, be there for her anyway and tell her you're glad she's learned that before things go any further.<br>  Good luck!

g5p3mB0haa	just ask him to meet u somewhere on your own say coffie shop,or park and tell him how u feel as then no one is there to disturb u|`|ScOVQvZEaa	I would say <br>  <br>  "Im gonna say something and if you like it you can take it and if you don't you can just leave it but.... How does Coffee in Starbucks sound some night this week"|`|3PC9NEajaa	i would ask them out lol = )

If you are a guy- you foreplay with the girl (AKA- kiss, nibble breasts, finger(stick finger in vagina) take off her clothes slowely) then you lay her down and open her legs, gently lower your penis into her vagina and let it out.  If you are a girl then its basicly the same thing but you don't finger and you open your legs.  Hope this helps!!!  If you have any question you can e-mail me!

MtQ9ea2Uaa	I'm sure there's worse and to some this will just sound embarassing but yeah, this is one of my worst.<br>  <br>  After lunch my boyfriend and I were walking to class and he stopped me right in front of him right in front of my english class. He was staring into my eyes and all that and then a friend of mine passes by. He says hi and I turn and say hi back. I feel something hit the left side of my hair and I realized my boyfriend had leaned in to kiss me. I awkwardly looked back at him and he just said "let's try that again" I still felt really awkward and we kissed and we just kept going for a bit. I forgot to breathe. We slowly pull away and the bell rings so we quickly go into our classroom. Yeah, we had that class together. And when we came in our class started clapping. They had been watching us through the big window and the window on the door the entire time.. <br>  <br>  Best!:<br>  The same guy and I went to my elementary school and we kissed sitting on the wood-chips by the swings. He had told me that he loved me and that I just can't imagine how much and that he just feels like screaming it out. I just laughed and told him I really loved him too. Then he kissed me. Slow but real passionate that makes you want to melt. It was amazing..<br>  But then the very next day he broke up with me. Not even kidding.|`|B3jpU4Jraa	my first kiss i was pushing my baby brother around in a stroller and i was hanging out with my friend, boyfriend , and his friend. my friend went inside real quick and his friend went to go to do chores for a while so it was just us. we were staring at my brother when i said can i ask you something? hes like yea. and then i got really nervous and said never mind. about 5 min later we were sitting on his front porch and i said all of a sudden do you wanna kiss. it was only like 3 seconds but it seemed like forever before he finally shook his head yes. and right after that my mom clled and said she needed her phone back so i said i will be right back. and i went home and said i will be at brandans for a little while longer so i went back and i was really nervouse and he was still waiting there sop i sat down and it was really akward. then i finally said i am really nervous. then all of a sudden my friend came back out and both me and brandan were loking at her then looking at thier house like saying get back inside right now! and then i said i am really nervous again then he said its okay then he wrapped his arms around me nd kissed me. i was so happy then after that i put my head on his shoulder and we just sat there but it wasnt akward though. after a while he said well i have to go inside i will tell megan to caom back out an di said okay then i spent the rest of the day hanging out with my friend megan|`|MRMECJrQaa	Well, for me my first kiss I will always remember.  It was with the guy I truly love with all my heart.  We were sitting in our Church Van driving to Florida for a youth convention (Big Stuff '08 Daytona), and it was about 1 in the morning, everyone but the driver was asleep, he held one of my hands, then I looked in his eyes, then he took his other hand, placed it on the side of my head, slowly leaned in, and kissed me.  It was so romantic (even though we were in a van)... and a first kiss is always special no matter what you do, so when that time comes, just do what feels natural. ? You will always remember your first kiss.|`|vy9EAvBvaa	Mine was cause of a dare..like 2 weeks ago<br>  My friends really wanted to see me and my bf kiss so they dared him to kiss me and so when we were leaving school we hugged and then kissed. x]<br>  <br>  i'm not really sure that counts..but oh well.|`|jjoBO3jkaa	My first kiss was terrible.... it was a dare. And I had no idea what I was doing. Like many other pre-teen first kisses. But I have heard of a few really good first kiss stories. Hope yours will be a good one.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	bring a mint.|`|qXH5WiWjaa	You know... 1st kisses are always the best.  Especially when they are will someone that keep that little piece of you.  Hopefully it will be a great first kiss for you (My actual 1st was neither romantic or very good).  My two most memorable kisses:<br>  <br>  I met this guy online.  I really enjoyed talking with him and we could talk for hours.  When we met in person, we again talked for hours.  Finally about 3 in the morning he very shyly asked me if he could kiss me.  I'll never forget that night because I've never been able to find someone else that I've been able to have that same thing with.<br>  <br>  My next memorable kiss happened with my most recent ex.  We had been texting the day before and she hinted how much she liked me and dared me to kiss her.  The next night she and I hung out and as she was leaving she hugged me goodbye and I could tell she was nervous.  I told her "Wait" then grabbed the back of her neck and said "I never back down from a challenge" and kissed her.  Her lips trembled when we kissed...  <br>  <br>  Hopefully your first kiss will be a good one.  Regardless, you'll always remember it.|`|tbbWp18taa	Okay here's my terrible story:<br>  My first kiss was the summer of my 5th grade year (going into 6th)<br>  Me and this boy were dating for like, a month and me and my friends were swimming at the pool. My boyfriend and his friends come to the pool and so me and my bf are swimming in the way deep end and all of a sudden he just plants one on me! lol. it was horrid! I started to sink and he grabs me to save me trying to be all heroic and my top falls off!! Bad day. Lol. to this day i try not to wear string bikini's<br>  =D|`|mKhTNsdRaa	Best kiss ever ---<br>  <br>  My boyfriend moved away last June.. So I finally found a way to go visit him over Halloween. (My parents don't know about us.) Our school gets an extra day off that day, so  yeah. It gave me a 3 day weekend.. He lives about 10 hours  away.. Anyways. So I drove up there, and surprised him, and we had lots of fun... Blahblahblah.. Anyways... It was my last half-and-hour with him, basically, and we'd exhausted any idea of what to do, and he decided he was hungry.. And we had to go back and er.. I needed to get my car anyways, lol. So we drove into town and he stopped at a gas station and got Junior mints.. <br>  <br>  And I was doing the hardest part of the whole trip, the leaving part. And gathered me into a big bear hug and kissed me goodbye...<br>  <br>  And tasted like a junior mint.<br>  .. And it just tasted... So amazing.. I dunno.. <br>  <br>  MAKE HIM EAT JUNIOR MINTS.|`|ZMU06oTjaa	My boyfriend and I were ice skating with two of our other friends and it was almost closing time and there were only a coupld of people on the ice and we were standing together near the DJ booth holding eachother with our noses touching, just smiling, and then we kissed. It was so cute, I kept telling him that I would fall, but he said he would catch me. (:<br>  We are still dating now, haha.|`|u8MOrhnvaa	Well, the worst kissed I've ever had was when i kissed my uncle's neighbor's son. he kissed me and I gave him the tongue and he pushed me away....<br>  <br>  the best...this guy that I'm still seeing, we met 3 yrs ago and we kissed in his car...two words to describe the kiss...intensely passionate.|`|lKutsYcWaa	My first kiss was great actually. We were in the hall after school and he just kissed me when we were hugging. It was really sweet and then we just walked away because we had to catch our buses!! Our friends watched too.|`|qhPdnzmIaa	a preplanned kiss is not a good kiss. when you do kiss make sure it is spur of the moment and use lots of tung|`|RmQzb0Avaa	i never had my first kiss D:|`|M2jNdXawaa	me and mynow fiancee had an amazing first kiss well infact we had two first kisses lmao ill explain <br>  <br>  ive known him all my life and when we was about 5 he asked me for a kiss i explained i couldnt see him so he pulled th cirtins back as there was a lamp post outisde his house blesss so cute then when we started dating coiple of year back ( 12 years after the last incident ) wednt met up after 10 years of no contact and i fell in love with him straight away so we were on a nigt out and i couldt resist no more i pinned him up against a shop window and kissed him it was like no one else was around <br>  <br>  he insists 2 this day i only did it as hedjust been 2 the cash machine!! lmao|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	You will know what to do. Make the first kiss short & sweet & then you can get better every time. Do close your eyes & a mint is a great idea. Make sure you want to kiss him because that is all that matter. Forget about what your friends are doing. When you get older you will laugh about how peer pressure was important back then. Good luck!|`|ZxEkyr1Kaa	Well myfirst kiss was akward I remmember I was actually on the movies with this guy that I adored with all my heart when all of a sudden he asked'Whywon't you kiss me 'and I said because you never ask for one ' and then just like that he asked me and then i ended up kissing him|`|5ekbXw9saa	Worst kiss? <br>  My ex sorta ran his teeth into mine..Baaaaad, don't do that!<br>  Best kiss?<br>  Take it nice n slow at first then i like to follow my guys lead then i start to take a lil control by gently squeezing on the back of their neck, while his hands are on my waist holding me close(:|`|Hi9i2orDaa	when me and my boyfriend kissed for the 1st time it was funny to him cause it was my first time and i bit his tingue ha but he thought it was cute and i am alot better now|`|Qbm3Vpilaa	if you think your ready go for it..don't rush your self for a kiss just cause all of your friends have kissed that's what make you an individual
12L5l3csaa	okay I understand why you are asking this so this is what i have to say....<br>  <br>  1) No. You are kicking someone you aren't really trying to hit the "right spot" you are trying to get the hell out of the place and get out of danger.<br>  <br>  2) Multiple. Yeah its sad but true.<br>  <br>  3) All times they backed away and looked at me like i was insane and ran off<br>  <br>  4) They all backed away<br>  <br>  okay all you have to do is have the mind power to think of doing somthing and the will power to actually DO it. and whwn you do do it you have to do it with meaning, feeling, and truth in other words don't tap their balls kick as hard as you possible can, and if that fails go for the shins, or nose. Just let them know that you will NOT for any reason deal with their bull sh*t|`|sfUUml0Daa	you probably didnt kick hard enough.<br>  next time try the Solar plex, Instep, Groin( didnt work) or nose. the most sensitive parts on a guy :D|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	slapping works too|`|uBw5zzyYaa	the first time it was because this guy wouldnt leave me alone and smacked by butt so i kicked him in the balls the second time was an accident we were at lunch and me and this guy were playing around and i accidentally punched him and he like fell haha funny i've only done it if the person wont leave me alone and i have no experience most of the time they jump or try to act tough and no special ways

If he doesn't just talk to him.|`|G3NqFgYlaa	Seriously, if you know him that well...<br>  <br>  Just tell him straight out, or when you're having a good time together <br>  <br>  Sharing how you feel with someone you like will NOT make you a loser<br>  -Other people would probably wish that they had the guts to do that alone|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Well don't gamble on it.  Pay attention to your books for now.  You will have more time to deal with grown up stuff when you are a grown up.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, basically just telling him, how you feel then just holding it in, all of it, it just increases the pressure you hold.|`|e3NwYCkhaa	Well I mean, if you dont tell him you like him, you can't really expect much in return. So you should definitly tell him how you feel.|`|5lu0TPUkaa	Hint it to him if possible, but telling some close friends to pass it around always works (it did for me!)<br>  <br>  Email me if you need any more help at catie.eaglelegend@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  :)|`|aYBJ3dyiaa	You won't be a loser, just if you like him, tell him that you think he is awesome, proceed to tell him what you like about him, and ask him if he'd like to accompany you to an event or activity that you may be involved in, that's when you'll find out if he has feelings for you.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps, feel free to email me with any other questions or concerns. :)<br>  <br>  runtsey4myman@yahoo.com|`|NRSiXNoNaa	Just be blunt with him if he is that kind of guy who is that way tell him you have thought about this for a while and in ur own way talk to him and let him know you like him. if he is the joking kind of guy then be cute about it when you tell him tell him the way he does things makes me feel warm makes me laugh.. Let him know but do not hide things. and if he likes you he will tell u the same|`|2GvhQtyhaa	well...if he's a person you can trust...i dont think there's a wrong way to tell him you like him...just go like...hey i need to tell you something...can we talk? (or you can say it on a text whatever) and say: "there's something i've been wanting to tell you...but first i need to know i can trust you...(he's supposed to say yes) then tell him you like him. =] good luck!|`|IKnEeMXLaa	just tell him, don't make it like a puzzle for him to figure out, i know from experience boys aren't that smart.  Just say it.|`|Gbvk7Vkuaa	You wont be a "loser" maybe you never know he might like you too.What I did was txt him and tell him and then he didn't believe me so I got my friend to pass it on to him now we are going out :) HOPE THIS HELPS|`|jCXZBwaUaa	flash him
YYdtd47baa	I don't think that's the best idea - no offense, but it sounds morbid. My suggestion would be to write a letter to her, saying how much you miss her around, and that you want her to get better, you can absolutely right down some memories, but don't get too hung up on them. It will make the letter dark - like she's about to die or something close to that. Write down a plan to go to Six Flags, or a really fun amusement park when she's feeling better. Aim for next year, or more if she needs that time to rest, and recover, and to treat whatever sickness she has. Frame a picture of both of you, (Hope you have one!) one that she'll appreciate to look at in her small hospital room, or her room (?). I'm not clear of the circumstances. Write "Love you." at the bottom of the page, and put it in a nice white envelope. Burn a candle and take the wax drippings to hold the envelope opening (where you would usually lick it shut) and drip them there, and it will look awesome and hold (it would look better with a red candle's wax). Write her name in script really beautifully on the other side. I think she'll like the effort put into the picture frame of you two, and the letter will be an intricate touch. Hope all goes well. <br>  Izy|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i'm not quite sure what you want us to put in this answer.. like the related headings bit but your idea sounds really good! :) it will really cheer your friend up, and show you have put a lot of effort into it - and it's something she can have beside her in the hospital to read and look at when she feels scared/upset :) it's a great idea; and really shows you care.<br>  <br>  you could write how much she means to you; and everything you love about her because that will really make her feel better and yeah just include little pictures of the funny times you've head and explain a few things in detail that will make her smile/laugh :) <br>  <br>  perhaps some funny sleepovers, funny days out, some funny times where you have both been told off in school - or just some catchphrases and sayings that you have both laughed at loads in the past :D she will really think this is a sentimental thing; and should cheer her up a lot :D maybe buying her her favourite chocolates (if she is allowed chocolate at the moment too) and you two can share them together when you go and visit :) she will be very grateful; i know i would be.<br>  <br>  hope i helped x|`|NZVP15Soaa	old school photograph reminisce about school<br>  dancing and the music you both love<br>  cinema /best film<br>  party you both attended<br>  finish off with a card of a clown reminding her of the fun you are both going to have when she is well again<br>  <br>  you sound like a wonderful friend<br>  take care|`|9a4dfe0e77089ac8a1dc8b156685c491aa	you don't have to be necessarily creative, its the thought that counts :) you're friend is one lucky person to have you as a friend who is caring and thoughtful person.  <br>  <br>  the kindness that you do for a friend, will never be forgotten and appreciated.
a13bf89cf30c3487b41a3cac19ab0acbaa	Just take it easy and it will come naturally.<br>  Above all be a Gentleman.|`|z3R61VzCaa	well if shes like all over you next time you guys make out and are hanging out.. then just be clever and see what she says.<br>  hope i helped:)|`|RVlkauBRaa	Like.. if you guys are snuggling each other watching tv or a movie then just slowly move your hand lower and if she doesnt react them eventually go down there. If she doesnt want you to do it, most girls will move or twitch or w.e lol|`|IkAtIQumaa	Just give it time [=|`|RmSzWzbsaa	ask her|`|ijZmJXggaa	for fingering with shorts or skirt on: when watching a movie (this is exactly how it worked for me) start stroking her leg, down near her calf.  I'm a touchy guy, and it's good for girls to know that you are not reserved at all when it comes to physical contact like snuggling or anything like that.  so when ur chillin on the couch, start strokin her leg slowly, on her calf, and run your fingers up and down her calf about a couple inches back and forth(hopefully she shaved haha) then, as the movie progresses SLOWLY, and i mean SLOWLY, start moving up her leg. like INCREDIBLY SLOWLY. (it took me seriously 15-25 mins to get up to the cash and prizes). (stroking is key to making good contact between a guy and a girl when being intimate, even when just chillin on a couch watchin a movie) once you hit her shorts/skirt line of clothes (after 15 mins at least of stroking) start playing with her shorts/skirt. just fiddle with them for awhile, and every once in awhile, let your fingers "slip" off the shorts/skirt and just barely up her shorts and then recover back to her pants. it doesnt need to be REALLY obvious that you slipped or anything like that, but with a finger or two, brush up against her leg under her pants. repeat the slipping. again and again. then slowly, and i mean SLOW DUDE. start to stroke her thigh, and slowly move your hand from her outer to her inner thigh VERY ****** SLOW.  once ur inner thigh, you will for sure have her attention, and if she has not yet backed off, you probably are good to go. maybe stay here for a couple minutes before doing anything, but once you reach underwear, start playing with them like you did with her shorts/skirt, and after a minute or two of playin with underwear, lean in really close to her (dont move your hand) and ask her if this is alright. if you get a yes, slip under the panties, and you're golden. if you get a no, retreat back out from under her pants, apologize, and just snuggle up with her.<br>  <br>  if she has jeans or pants on that you cannot do this with, then either dont try it, or do the similar thing by starting on her midsection (abs) and just stroke her lightly and slowly move down.  i dont think this way works as well though because they dont get as excited as they do with the leg thing<br>  if you havent fingered a girl before, msg me and i'll explain in detail haha i figure this answer has gotten pornographic enough.<br>  <br>  you dont ever make a move on a girl by asking her, like "oh, do you wanna have sex?" or at least not the first time, unless you guys are drunk.  you make a move in your actions. if this backfires, which i doubt it will unless she's on her period or is completely against it, just apologize and i doubt there will be a problem.|`|QwYfHol4aa	First off, if she said she wants to wait until prom, don't. wait until after prom, you will seem to be in it for her personality instead of sex. As for foreplay, just go slow, if she doesn't want it, she should let you know.|`|2GvhQtyhaa	just wait. you'll find out what she wants. just dont ask her during a moment of passion! that would ruin it!. and yeah be a gentlemen dont get all horny and annoying. try to control yourself. she'll guide you to what she wants =]|`|Oyvlt2vyaa	When your making out, ask her if she wants you to.  If she says no, respect it.  It's easy as that.  But only do stuff you feel ready for.|`|7LtMU8MTaa	You should probably go ahead and just rape her. This way, she has nothing to wait for, thus "fingering her" won't be such a big deal. You're welcome!|`|uSDb8fBpaa	maybe light touching just whatever is appropriate.  And by god educate yourself on safe sex (DONT assume you have all the facts) before prom night.  <br>  <br>  Have fun|`|25FHka2Taa	well just ask her shes your girlfriend so you should be able to talk to her but i think you should get her permission before you try anything|`|HyaZEFrlaa	Well you could do your own research and suprise her.|`|ZxEkyr1Kaa	Well In my opinion it all depends on her|`|afWtzwosaa	It's very easy to find this out. Next time when you are over at her house making out start by placing your hand over heat crotch, don't do anything just put it over her privates, don't gyrate it, don't press against her body. If she doesn't take you're hand away the start putting a bit of pressure, if she still doesn't take your hand, then start moving your fingers in a circular motion above her vagina, remember this all outside her clothes. Do this for at least 3 minutes, if by then she still hasn't taken your hand then you can proceed to placing your hand inside her pants and outside her panties, repeat the same step as before.  Trust me if she doesnt want you doing this, she'll let you know and remember respect her wishes.|`|QdMIiYBCaa	ask her what her boundries are. Not like at the moment that would kinda ruin it.  But my boyfriend sent me a text asking if i would be cool with that, and only after i OK's it did he do it. It was nice and i felt respected rather than feeling uncomfortable and telling him to back off and making everything awkard! it might seem like a silly text to send, but if your not mature enough to have an open and honest convo then I don't think you ae mature enough to be doing these things!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|5dVYnX1yaa	respect her n she will respect you. just wait til prom . be a gentle man. mayb if u r really patient she might want it b4 prom

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Then you need to express your desires to him honey. Make sure he knows how you feel. It's weird, when people get married it seems like a lot of couples lose  interests in sex.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Everyone is different. <br>  <br>   Respect his wishes as if the roles were reversed, wouldn't you want the same respect back?|`|1HTRWrawaa	This is a constant problem in almost all marriages. One of you want sex more often then the other one does. That's where you have to compromise. He has to give in a little and you have to back off a little. Believe me, nagging your husband for more sex isn't going to put him in the mood and want sex with you more often. <br>  <br>  Try to put yourself in your husband's shoes. What if you wanted sex 3 or 4 times a week and your husband wanted sex twice a day? He wanted sex every morning and every night and on his days off wanted it 3 or 4 times that day. This is way more sex then you want and desire and he is always complaining he needs more sex and complaining that you aren't giving it to him often enough. Would his complaining, make you feel hot and desire him more often or would you feel pressured to have more sex, more sex, more sex and feel like a piece of meat, instead of loved? Chances are his complaining would make you want sex with him even less often.<br>  <br>  Try talking to your husband without making him feel like a sexual failure. You can always try to spice things up a little in the bedroom and add some variety.|`|66jX06Onaa	Maybe you need to find ways to please him more. Look up information on better ways to please a man. Also, consider his stress level at his job. That could be an issue too. If you have the money, you might consider getting him a regular massage appointment with a reputable masseuse to help him relax. Make sure he gets some down time to do things he enjoys too. Cater to his needs and he should start paying attention to your needs more.|`|WF085j2Daa	You got yourself a dud hon sad to say if he is like this at 24 he will be finished by thirty and where will you be then|`|bjsOnyPkaa	Agree with the earlier answer. Go by some toys otherwise it's only a matter of time before you cheat on him.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	I don't think it's normal. I am the same way in my relationship with my husband. Does he work, do you have any children? Are you prego? <br>  If any or all of the above come into play in your situation, it could be affecting his ability to "preform."<br>  I don't know how it is for you, but my husband has work, and school, and we have a baby who I'm with 24/7.<br>  He could just feel mentally drained and it's starting to get in the way of your sexual relationship.<br>  You should just try to help him out as much as possible with anything, if you can. <br>  Also, let him know how much you love what he does, as far as taking care of you, and loving you goes. Flatter him a lot. Men are suckers for flattery.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6a397149e84e6d2e731eb79dbc0a7cbfaa	This is so unfair! I married the love of my life. After the first few months of marriage, she would get mad and say that ALL I ever want was sex. I would masturbate several times a day so I wouldn't bug her so much and cause fights. It got to the point that we would go three months between having sex. After several years she told me that I should get a girlfriend so I would quit bugging her about it. I had a couple of flings and it made me feel horrible. Over the years things would get better for awhile and then not so good. It has been HELL. I found out that she started cheating on me. She said, that I cheated on her so what was the big deal. The big deal was I cheated 25 years ago, she cheated for 4 years and still does not want to have sex with me....Get the picture?<br>  My wife couldn't be honest with me and tell me she didn't like me.<br>   I was always kissing up to her thinking there was something wrong with me. Now29 years have gone by, we have 2 girls one 2 years from being 18 the other out of the house. I am easy going but my wife is really not a nice person. I wish I would have known it was her and not me that was the problem. Run from this guy! If he is not cheating on you, he will. And if you cheat on him he will use it against you forever. And believe me it can happen to anyone. I loved my wife so much and she told me to have an affair...I should have known but was blinded by my own stupidity. You deserve more. he is an ***.|`|QZEDisIsaa	TALK TO HIM!!!!!!!  COMMUNICATION!!!  Seriously, just tell him.  As women, we tend to think that the men know exactly what we're thinking and what we want, but honey they have no clue.  They're not going to know what we want unless we tell them.  So tell him.  For all you know he could feel the same way but doesn't want to pressure you.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Clutch the pearls baby! You might want to invest in self pleasuring toys. Have him partake in the process and all is well.<br>  <br>  Good luck Sugar.|`|8TDnfCkaaa	it doesn't seem normal since he's only 24. The answer can only be gotten from him so I suggest you ask him why he doesn't want it more often.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	lol yeah girls seem to be hornier when they are married, well guys seem to knock it off maybe you should talk about him about your urges|`|09k5GLLkaa	Welcome to Marriage.....All people, man and woman are different. That is the truth.|`|JbKPj42Uaa	well you hormones are raging u may be pregnate. or its just natural u may just like it a lot lol|`|tHH9G26zaa	hey , im in the opposite situation to you , i want to have a sex but my girlfriend just isnt interested at all , she is pregnant however so i dont know whether it because of that ?? my advice would be to talk to him about it , you never know what could be up ?? maybe something is stressing him or perhaps he likes someone else ?? does he go out more often , is he secretive ? does he seemed depressed or stressed ??
MCeh0uIaaa	I'm sorry you didn't get any other answers : / I don't know how to help you because I'm in the same position. Kinda. I really like this guy but I don't think he likes me. We admitted to eachother that we liked eachother but that was in 4th grade. Now we're freshman & I'm not sure if he likes me. I really like him & I would totally go out with him is he asked me. Just to top it off though, we are in a totally different circle of friends. He is extremely popular & I have many friends but I'm not one of the rich girls who are the size of a tooth pick and have a head full of highlights. I don't know what to do : / I know I'm supposed to be an answerer but if YOU have any advice for ME or figure out your situation let me know? good luck : /
WFNG45Znaa	You shouldn't worry about that stuff, because you really shouldn't have to change who you are for a guy. Honestly, if he really likes you, he won't care how you look.|`|O0rpPItWaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmE5ARBQkRJdEsYVmq09Y3zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309162118AAfoGfA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  he will like you for you. dont be something your not. plus you'll have to be undolled at a point in your life and he'll have to be there to see it and heck who knows maybe he'll like that better? dont try so hard.|`|e3NwYCkhaa	Definitely just try not getting dolled up and see what happens. If he likes you when your not all dolled up, then he's one of the rare guys out there, and you know he likes you for just being you.|`|4hPwn7ilaa	Omg I feel the same way sometimes, if I really like a guy I try to look extra pretty for him before I go to see him I fix my hair, fix my clothes, spray perfume on myself, & swipe a coat of lipgloss to make my lips look soft and kissable (teehee =D) I even try to stand cute when he's around, you know I'm sure every girl does it, it's a normal thing. You know if he knew you did that I'm sure it'd make him happy because it shows you care about his opinion & what he thinks & you want to make extra time to look good for him. I'd be very flattered if a guy did little "guy touch-ups" on himself for me!<br>  <br>  & Well sometimes contrary to what most people are saying here. When a guy likes you for your looks it's not that bad, that's if he doesn't really know you. Like this one guy who I really started liking, basically just liked me for my looks first of all because he didn't even know me & he never even talked to me before. But he was attracted to the way I looked so that made him want to get to know me, sure it may sound pretty shallow of him at first but when his friend told me he said he thought I was pretty I thought that was really sweet of him to say that. & after he talked to me for a while he started liking me for more then just my looks.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	How can we answer what is not a question?? Please, all you teenage girls, stop doing this! If you are going to rant, at least make it somewhat of a question!!|`|DNouvr9maa	Try not getting dolled up see what happens|`|AA11480344	It's nice to look pretty for a guy, but everytime you see him...that could be a bit much. <br>  Try not dressing as pretty as you normally do. He may like you only for your looks and that could make a bad ending.<br>  OR<br>  You could ask him about it. Don't be afraid to show him the real you. Remember: you don't have to change for a guy, if he's the right one he'll like you just the way you are.|`|QHvuD8SJaa	If you see him 100 times, and out of those 100 times, 99 times you were pretty and 1 time you weren't, he won't even remember the 1 time you weren't.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	well all i say is that always be yourself and well if someone is going to like you, he is going to like you for who you are, not for all that makeup or nice looking you are,looks fade and when they realize that it is over|`|CzS1EiV9aa	At least put a little make up on, just don't go all crazy.

e6Kyqb22aa	Yes, it is very hurtful not to get invited but why don't you buy her a niice grad. present to make her feel bad and give it to her right before the party?...also are you sure she didn't just automatically invite you and not tell you? Or is it like she definitley siad that you weren't? You're not overreacting at all. I would be sooo mad. I think your cousins are okay but maybe that's where you're overreacting. They didn't ask to be invited and it is HER grad. party(I'm not going against you, you just need to look at her point of view. :) ) lol two parentheses! :)  okay, so maybe even talk to her if you're close enough. I wish you luck!|`|UAXHmqgRaa	I would be hurt that I wasn't invited too, but you just gotta let it be tho. If she wants you to come, then she will invite you, but don't let it bother you too much tho because you wouldn't want to be around ppl who pretend to be your friend then talk about you behind your back.
p52TpAhYaa	How old is she? She needs to waited out and speak in front of the judge to tell him/her who she wants to live with and why. The judge will have the child's best interest in mind. The judge won't automatically give custody to the mom if your sis says "I want to live with my mom because she's cooler, etc...). Your sister should not run away it will not look good on your mother's part.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	she will go where the court tells her to go... if she doesn't she is considered a run away and anyone that takes her in will go to jail.

ftkoXIN6aa	Some people cheat, it happens...and sometimes we could forgive them when they realize the mistake. However your guy is clearly being a jerk, he cheated and seems to still want to go at it..I think you should forget about him, I know it will be hard but there's a big chance that he will continue doing it.<br>  You should only give him a chance when he does it by mistake and apologizes or at least tries his best to make your relationship, work but your bf isn't doing neither.<br>  <br>  So no....don't give him a chance.<br>  <br>  I have cheated on my bf, with a guy friend of mine once--but I was tipsy, horny, and it meant nothing. He broke up with me though, however we got back to being friends and we started dating again. So yeah...it depends. its not just guys.|`|UtrgRjTeaa	It can be different for every person. To some people, absolute loyalty is incredibly important and this would be a dealbreaker. Some people prioritize loyalty less and would find it easier to forgive him. You're going to have to decide for yourself whether you've been too emotionally hurt by this to consider going on with him.<br>  <br>  Things to consider: Is he really, honestly sorry? How hurt were you by this? Do you think it is likely to happen again? Do you need to change something about your relationship so that you two are more satisfied with it? Have your own emotional needs changed as a result of this trauma? Will he be able to meet your new emotional needs?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to answer your question with more questions, but it's a really personal decision that would be different for every person. Good luck, and remember to listen to what your heart is telling you.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	Forget him. i hate guys like that. makes the rest of us look bad.|`|9AncZe3aaa	Kick his unappreciative *** to the curb.If he's cheated on you before he will in fact do it again.Plus wtf???he is still texting her and saying all those things he should be saying to you??!!There are plenty of guys out there that won't cheat on you...you deserve better,plus you owe it to yourself to try someone else out.|`|BYE3eIdwaa	yes forget him he sounds like scum!!!! once the trust is gone there is nothing left and the love means nothing ... you can love someone as much as you want in a relationship but trust is the most important thing<br>  <br>  forget him and the friend aswel thats no friend if she can do that to you <br>  <br>  xx
eGpOIV12aa	at age 16, you are just discovering what the difference is between love and in love is.<br>  <br>  sounds like you love this guy but you arent "in love" with him.<br>  dating him again probably wont lead you both into being "in love" with each other.<br>  <br>  it takes a lot of broken hearts and relationships to know what you are looking for to be "in love"<br>  <br>  maybe you like this guy because he is there time to time and you dont want to step out of your comfort zone by dating anyone else.
XmJZkFuMaa	So.... because you go behind her back, lie, cheat, break the rules at school, and generally aren't keeping her trust... you're complaining because she doesn't trust you?  Sorry, but if I was your mom I would have put your phone in the compactor or sold it on ebay.  You were already restricted from it for only a week.  You really deserve the larger restriction from it.  <br>  <br>  She's not overreacting.  She tried giving you the shorter one week sentence.  You're the one who broke it, so you're the one who gets a larger, harder, sentence.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	what a little !@#$ a phone is a privilege why the hell would she trust you|`|VkpFImx4aa	Your mom has every reason not to trust you. Pay attention is school.|`|zPvlh82naa	I don't trust you either|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	here is how you can get your phone back.<br>  wait until next year. then if i were you, i'd start doing what i was told so i wouldn't loose it again, which you probably will anyway.  you don't seem to be a kid that minds the rules.  you lost once and you will loose again!!!

BKr3y30maa	If you both want it to work, it will work.  Long distance relationships do have a stronger strain when it comes to other relationships....but they are not impossible.

I just recently was in a long distance relationship with my G/F. We were 6 hours away which was difficult. i would never do it again. 1 hour and a half is not too bad. It will last as long as you have trust and love eachother and are both willing to compromise and work to make it work. Wish you well.|`|7Ywg0gjaaa	Just go for it.

AA11150213	Follow your instinct. I don't think your girlfriend is being faithful to you either. You getting back with her in the first place was a bad mistake, but what's done is done. <br>  <br>  The fact that you had to save her conversations is a sign that there is a lack of trust in your relationship, and you can't have a relationship without trust. Her saying that she did it on purpose was her way of making an excuse and trying to push everything on you. I believe in second chances too, but once a cheater always a cheater.<br>  <br>  I would tell you to leave her but what makes this very complicated is that you now have a child in the picture. I don't believe that you should stay in an unhappy relationship just because you have a child with her because if mommy and daddy are not happy together and are always arguing, your child will pick up on that and they too wont be happy.<br>  <br>  I would suggest counselling but it doesn't even seem like she wants to change her ways or even admit she's wrong. Maybe it is best you two part ways because you deserve to have someone in your life who appreciates, respects and loves you. This doesn't mean you abandon your child, you need to make sure you are apart of that child's life and makes sure you spend time with the child even if that means getting the courts involved. Staying in an unhappy relationship isn't healthy for you or your child.

She has the discretion of sharing this information with a romantic partner who is mature enough to appreciate attention to the sensual details.<br>  <br>  Things must work out for you without compromise.

Time to give him HIS walking papers.  Hope this helps...|`|8wDXm4Kiaa	It sounds as if you already know the answer to this undesirable question.  In my opinion, yes, you need to leave for more reason than one.  His cheating seems to be apart of him.  It doesn't seem as if he will stop this.  Second, he seems, according to you, to be a bit on the aggressive side "punching holes in walls" is not normal, especially if it's not your fault.  My suggestion, tell him to pack his stuff and leave, if it is your house, then get the police/lawyers involved to remove him.  <br>  <br>  He needs to be someone else's problem.  You are probably too beautiful, loving and caring to put up with that..<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|2keIEMFUaa	Get a restraining over against him and sit his things outside the house in trash bags and change all the locks to your house.  Let him know you mean business.|`|zHWpXWkRaa	i know where your coming from, only i been dealing with this for 10yrs. its hard to leave, trust me i know seeing as im back with my husband and people always act like its so easy to just go but not everyone has the money to go...family to stay with or money to take care of things (bills, rent ect) if they kick the man or woman out of the home. however thats still not a reason to stay with someone that treats you that way, you have to think about "Is this really how I want to live my life"? Little advice is always put back some money that he dont know about so if you get to the point where you want to leave you can make it on your own until you have a job or a 2nd job. If your like me your thinking you hope he will change but hun he wont unless he gets some help then maybe, he dont seem to want to change and you cant change someone, it just dont work. You dont want to live your life on edge all the time thinking and wondering if/when he will cheat. get violent..life is way to short to live like that girl...think about it. Good luck to you and contact me if you need a friend.|`|EyKmEptVaa	You should not put up with his cheating and violent tantrums,contact a divorce attorney and start the process,i know it's easier said then done,but YOU have to make the first step,if you you continue in this dysfunctional abusive sham of a marriage it will only get worst, he does not respect you nor the sanctity of marriage .PLEASE protect yourself physical,mentally,emotionally ,financially and sexually  .<br>  <br>  Get you a network of family and friends to help keep you focused and strong.<br>  Also get a order of protection since he has violent tendencies.Bless you and good luck,you deserve better.|`|VqilAWDGaa	When he gets in these rages call the police, if you are afraid of him. You can go to your local magistrate court and file an eviction notice on him if you really want him gone, or you can call the police when he's violent towards you and a judge will sign off on a Temporary Protective Order, or He will issue you a Restraining Order. You should seek help from a Domestic Violence Shelter in your area if you are afraid of him.|`|B53KDVuJaa	This guy sounds like an unhinged jerk. Tell him you want a divorce and he can go stay with one of the chicks he cheated on you with. If that provokes a violent reaction, call the police and get him put in jail and then go get a restraining order. After the cheating and violence, if you continue to stay with him, you pretty much get what you deserve.|`|n3pkbRizaa	First.... It's yours and your husbands house. All property is equally divided.<br>  Second...Have him put in jail<br>  Third....You should have your butt kicked(not literally) for over looking the cheating.

If your ex's are around when you and her are together do you think she feels insecure or awkward around them too? <br>  <br>  Just show her more understanding and let the past stay where it is, the past. If she's showing you her full attention and love then why worry? She's obviously learned from her mistakes and doesn't want to be in that position again. She's probably as awkward as you are around the group of guys she's been with even though yall are friends.<br>  <br>  If you truly can't get over it then let her down easy.

Are you the same person you were when you were 22? Highly unlikely.<br>  <br>  If you care about her and like the person she's become then who cares about who she was in the past. Get over it.|`|4ESlizXraa	I went out with this guy in college who, four months into our relationship, told me he was very suprised at how long we had lasted considering that I had slept with his friends ______ and ______  .<br>  <br>  This was a shock to me as I had gone out on dates with them and there had been kissing but no sex.  So he had been laboring under a false impression for four months.<br>  <br>  My grandfather once told me that with boys, "when all is said and done, there's more said than done."<br>  <br>  So there's the possibility that they... embellished, we'll say, the truth of their involvement with this girl.  That would make sense if you say you know five people who claim they've slept with her and she puts her total number of partners at 13.  Either you run in the same circles almost exclusively, or there's some fibbing by someone.<br>  <br>  There is also the very real possibility that she has simply matured since then.<br>  <br>  Either way, if she isn't exhibiting the behavior now that argues that she's changed and you should deal with the person she is rather than the person she was.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	It bugs you.

Don't punish her because you arent secure enough to deal with her past. If she is good to you and you care about her, that's what matters.

She maybe does and may be loves you very much. Leave the past behind!
rWqPRCeiaa	Hold the press! did you and your new husband talk about this before everything begin to take place. Now if you did and you agreed because of tradition and did not stated you had some reservation about having them move in then your stuck! Unless there are other family members you can ask if they have room. And PLEASE DO NOT FORGET. You still have a say as to what goes on in your home. Talk to your husband and do not start or even think about withholding intimacy that is a road that is less travel and need never be taken. Holding and touching give comfort to both of you and in this situation you need all the com front and attention you can get. Support each other stay in like if not in love.Also check into other family members who may have the same situation and see if you can pair two of the same up in a location they can afford together work it out together.|`|v7Wflu78aa	I have an American (anglo) friend who was dating Indian guys, and then she found out about the tradition of the mother moving in.

54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	Wow! I'm sorry but your husband must not have any self-esteem. If you're really sincere, then you need to stop being selfish and worrying about yourself. Find a job, tell your husband about the other men and file for divorce since he is obviously too afraid to do it himself.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry for your sexual abuse but that is no excuse for treating your husband like this. If you really believe he's a good man, you will stop stringing him along for financial security and allow him to eventually find someone who appreciates him.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	I happen to be in the category of people who are nearly perfect in comparison to you and I don't plan to call you any names. If your husband is fine with 3 then i bet on my yearly salary he have few on the sideline himself (that is a fact btw).

This continued to happen to her between when she was 8 and 12 years old. That was ca. 40 years ago.<br>  <br>  She repeatedly cheated on me, but it took me a while to find out and I finished with her. (20 years ago)<br>  Outwardly she seemed so normal, she hid her true self well.<br>  <br>  I heard she continued doing the same to almost every guy she went out with, I guess she was "punishing" those that loved her, as a kind of retaliation for what her grandfather did to her.<br>  I was one of the few that she told about her childhood.<br>  I tried to help her but she resisted, telling me to concentrate on my own problems. She even got nasty and taunted me about her affairs, telling me I was never man enough for her.<br>  <br>  Twelve years ago I returned to England and found out she'd blown her own brains out with a shotgun.<br>  Another of her boyfriends told me that she told him she was ashamed of what she had done and ended up lonely. He didn't realise she was in such desperation, until a few days later when he heard the news.<br>  I cried like never before after hearing this news.<br>  It still brings tears to this day.<br>  <br>  Need I tell you more ?<br>  Get help darling, you need to overcome the aweful childhood trauma you went through.<br>  And you need to forgive men, we are not all like those that did these terrible things to you, when you were a child.|`|bf6K6uubaa	It sounds like BPD and what you need is a combo of therapy and meds to stabalize your mood.  why didn't counseling work?  cause you didn't want it to? you need to see a psychologist not a masters level counselor or lower..this is serious and if you can't see a psychologist see a psychiatrist cause they'll be able to prescribe for you.  you don't respect your husband or your relationship cause he makes it easy for you not to.  I mean why wouldhe let you do this stuff and take you back?  he's insecure and has low self esteem.  you both know he deserves better.  honestly you're better off getting separated right now...work on your stuff and then maybe get back together...i know its hard cause you have no money so sleep in a different room or in the living room..not in the ame bed as your husband...give it space..decide what you really want to do and more than anything get help.  realy help like i said not some random fairly educated helper...a PhD professional.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	10 guys in 2 years, that about a new guy every 2 months.<br>  <br>  Well, since you feel he deserves better you are proving yourself right by bang so many guys.

I would suggest that since you don't have savings and since he wants you to stay, that you remain in your relationship with him WHILE you work on yourself.<br>  <br>  What you experienced as a child is your past, and you continue to allow it to affect your present which isn't good. It sounds to me like you need to forgive yourself first and learn from your mistakes. The fact that you can see that your hubby is a good person really helps you too...sometimes that is all that matters. <br>  <br>  Besides counseling there are other avenues of hope available to you. Try looking around your community for help. I've attached a link to Ronda LaRue in California...she is someone I recently visited & fell in love with her work. Please take a look around her website & consider one of her retreats.<br>  <br>  Life doesn't always hand us treats. I was also abused as a child & went thru much of what you have gone thru with hubby. This is our reaction to life, but does it really have to be so bleak? I believe that I can take my life back into my own hands & do with it what I love. It is my life to live after all. I know that you can do this too. The first step is the hardest, but you can do it! <br>  <br>  The fact that your hubby is still beside you is a testament to your overall goodness as a human being. If your hubby didn't see the good inside of you, he would've left long ago. Just don't give up on yourself! Now that you see that your behavior is detrimental...change it! It's in your hands! You have that ability! Even if you are scared, it's ok to change. Learn everything that you can about why you feel the way you do, and learn how to change those feelings to be more positive and productive for you & your family. Good luck!|`|wia9SXCPaa	Your right he does deserve better.  Show him some mercy and divorce him.

It might take some time but he will fall out of love with you.  I don't love my husband anymore.  I am trying because he wants to make it work now, but now I have fallen out of love with him.  It feels like he is a friend and thats all.  I used to hang on his every word.  It's funny how something like cheating can change everything.  I hope you do find peace after what you have done.

And if you want to prefer the love of many men over one man, than I would leave the husband. Especially, if you are not going to make any effort to correct your behavior. You didn't mention children, and I sincerely hope you do not have children in this type of relationship. How terrible for THEM to see mom behave as you are and daddy just accepting it. Do you WANT your children to follow in your foot steps?

1KfbgBupaa	You can't tell anyone who they can be friends with - it's called controlling personality.  If he wants friends you don't approve of, that's his business; you get to make the choice whether or not to remain in this relationship.  You can let him know you are uncomfortable with the situation and why; he gets to choose what he needs to do.  There are times friends of the opposite sex are just that, friends - and there are times it's not an innocent situation but you must decide how you will handle the situation so both of you can be happy with the outcome.
wCTq9p2Uaa	I would go to a marriage counselor. Like you said, he doesn't want to split up and is willing to do anything to repair your marriage. The two of you need to work as A Team and not as 2 Teams. The two of you may need to sacrifice some things in your lives. In a marriage, the key to working it out is unity. Think it over real hard and decide what is more important, your husband or another man. In the Bible it says in Matthew 19:26 that with God all things are possible. Good luck!

I would ask him out when he seems ready maybe a month or like 2 weeks. If your friend doesn't want you to go out with him then don't. Friends are more important than boys. Remember that. Ask him out like in 2 and a half weeks.|`|ht2AlMAHaa	i dont know what this guy xmyfinalsinx is talking about you should go ahead and be that rebound and dont think of it as a rebound because what if he gets a rebound before you and then he ends up falling in love with her then your chance is all over be hes next not his ex|`|dVkCZpADaa	Just ask HIM out!! Sometimes guys like that.  And who cares if he says no at least you tried and wont live your life wondering what would have happened. Good Luck!|`|PbCeuT36aa	If you and your friend treat guys like "**** a *****", then go for it and ask him out after your friend rejects him.  **** even have a 3some.|`|llPW1XAKaa	The worst thing you could do is ask him out just after he has been rejected by your friend, he may think your taking advantage of the situation. The best thing you can do is comfort him after his rejection and check he is ok, he could see you in a different light then. <br>  <br>  Also he may be telling you he is going to ask your friend out just to see your reaction, it may be a red herring, or he is trying to make you jealous, boys work in mysterious ways sometimes. Its difficult to say.<br>  <br>  hope ive helped in some way, just let it take its course, just relax and be yourself and things should turn out well in the end.|`|g8kbs8Idaa	Hey :)<br>  First of all, you should break it to the boy who you fancy that he is wasting his time with your friend as she isn't interested in him.<br>  (may sound harsh i know)<br>  I'm sure that if you told your friend how you feel about the boy that she will be fine with you asking him out, and if she isn't then what sort of friend is she? It's obvious that she has no intention of going out with him and clearly doesn't see him in that way!<br>  However i do think you should wait a bit before asking, because it could seem like your jumping in there as soon as your friend turned him down.<br>  Leave it a while and then ask him.<br>  but not for too long otherwise he could be looking else where!|`|WTdbmaiUaa	well ask him out i mean how hard can it be u just walk up to him and say do u want to go out with me and heel anwser if he says no u say well i am to good for u so back off and then he will want u i did that once to a boy iliked and he came running after me all over the place.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	don't ask him <br>  When we get a girl in our sights its like cat and mouse XD<br>  umm itll take time<br>  let your friend break his heart,  then he most likely will rebound to someone (you dont want to be the rebound) <br>  <br>  After the rebound then its your time.|`|9utDJvUsaa	Let your friend reject him and then offer yourself as sloppy seconds!!!!!!<br>  Everybody wins!|`|D5UAhY8jaa	its ok to ask him but he might use you to get to your friend|`|9c1N7skCaa	after she says no ask him out|`|RRGoldrAaa	That will be good i think .<br>  <br>  unless if he tries to get close to your friend through you

y2nC8BUGaa	dump him|`|AA12198711	There is no room in any relationship for jealousy. Jealousy is a wasted emotion. <br>  <br>  If jealousy is an issue that you want to heal in your relationships, the first thing you must do is have the willingness and courage to talk about the issue in a non-judgmental way with each other.|`|AA11441704	you show him there is nothing to be jealous about..........|`|hcRGqk2gaa	Jealous like jealous when you go out with guy friends????? Stop going out with guy friends. <br>  <br>  Jealous like jealous when you go somewhere without him at all?? Leave him.......<br>  <br>  My bf of course doesn't want me to go out with other guys that may just be friends..... I cut all ties. Going out with the girls didn't bother him except the fact that they were all single with no kids and I wasn't. LOL. <br>  <br>  But he didn't care because he trust me. :)<br>   Good luck|`|vwoqIUR6aa	tell him you only care for him and his jealously is making you not like him as much as before.|`|3r7AElMlaa	"kiss my *** *****" then slap him in the face and go =)|`|cSpTN4Wpaa	punch him in the face. bam. dealt with.|`|zce6nlueaa	sit down and talk to him.<br>  Tell him that you love him very much, and you trust him with everything you got. and all this mistrust from him is hurting your relationship. <br>  and the more he doesn't trust you, the more you would try to hid from him to spare his feelings. Ask him if he thinks its fair/what he wants that he is forcing you to lie to him, and eventually drift away from him.|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	TELL HIM BYE>> you don need a guy that tries to control you.. thats where it starts then it leads to him getting mad cuz your not with him and so on and so forth say bub bye to the douche|`|JCdBSULraa	Don't flirt and screw with other guys|`|abmYBrMdaa	get rid of him<br>  he doesn't trust or respect you if you have to ask this!|`|V6dz395kaa	Tell him that u love him more than any other guy.|`|AA11328507	Dump him!|`|WPZI510laa	break up with him|`|Di6FAQxRaa	You can't. You have to tell him to calm down and ensure him that he can trust you. He's obsessed with you and doesn't want u to be with anyone else so that is a serious issue. My daughter's father was like that and he became abusive after a while , we've been separated for over 3 years but he still doesn't want to see me with other guys. You can leave him or he can change, theres nothing you can do to stop him form being jealous. Ask him why he's so jealous and try to reassure him that he doesn't need to be. It gets frustrating but he has to change or tellhim you are gonna leave, give him an ultimatum and let him know it upsets you !|`|hF6uZqWRaa	i agree with the other person...get rid of him. but if you really like him it will just take time for him to trust you. My bf was super super jealous in the beginning and he has changed a little with time (we been together for 3 years). If you think its worth it work with him to change his ways but if its not don't even bother...move on there is plenty of guys out there :)|`|CFFuFof1aa	Leave his *ss!!!!!!! I was with a very jealous guy one time. I mean if I took longer than 30 minutes at the grocery store he was accusing me of something. Believe me they never change and most jealous guys will become abusive. I was with him for over a year before he hit me. Leave him and move on!!!!!!!|`|Nmi45Z4Uaa	Tell him there no need for the jelousy<br>  Cus you love him<br>  Just take him to a quiet peaceful place and tell him how you really feel about him and tell him you love him!<br>  (IF YOU DO?)<br>  X|`|gZmIk7k3aa	tell him up front to chill and tell him how you feel bout it if he dosent give him the boot|`|AA11841749	Don't deal with him.

LxfqUaaIaa	Ask her out on a non-official date with a date-like atmosphere. Tell her you were planning on seeing a movie with some friends (invite mutual ones so that she's comfortable) and you'd really like it if she could come along too.<br>  <br>  Just be sincere and go slow, see where it takes you :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	dunno what to say///|`|dhTMwvDvaa	ask her. Go up to her and ask her directly "Do you or do you not like me ___________________?" if she says no, move on. if she says yes.<br>     Insert girls name here<br>  then you ask her out. oh and dont do it around her friends......she might not be honest then.<br>  another tactic would be to stop looking at her for awhile. pretend she doesnt exsist.<br>  or. be really sweet. i mean, have u tried talking to her?? try it and be really sweet. give her things....not like, expensive things, but well, cute things.........<br>  <br>  any of those 3 would be good to try. or try them like this:<br>  be sweet to he first.<br>  then ask her.<br>  then if she says no, pretend she doesnt exsist.<br>  hopefully this helped.......i dunno what to say lol =]
AA10874773	girl, it sounds like your still holding onto the man he WAS.  Either you can accept him for who he is now or not.  If not, you just need to cut him off completely - no texts, calls, visits.  Him telling you your free to see men is a big sign that he still doesnt know what he wants.  good luck!|`|BhlGe0A8aa	He will eventually want to know and have a relationship with his child.<br>  If you can't accept it then move on now.It was an accident ,but she exists.<br>  You are on a hiding to nothing!<br>  Would you ever be able to accept that he has a child in his life?<br>  I have had the same problem-I could not take it on and it has caused no end of trouble in our marriage.<br>  25 years down the line and it is still coming between us.Find someone else without baggage.|`|Bq51x58jaa	he is doing the best he can in the situation but if u really think u can never accept the child then u must let him go as its not the childs fault. she didnt ask to be born into this complicated mess. if u cant deal with the long distance then u must ask urself if u really love him because i believe if u really love someone it should work out against all odds.so cut him a break and see where it goes and dont hold any grudges against his child as he needs to step up to the plate where she is concerned.|`|Tm11j4yXaa	Mag hanap ka na lang ng iba.

Pero isipin mo ang kinabukasan mo...  it sure is more than 5 years.  <br>  <br>  Sa 5 years from now, may iba ka na, baka may asawa ka na, baka may baby ka pa.  But you have to let go of this one.  Hindi ka mag advance kung hindi mo ito bitawan.|`|chENztVEaa	I can't believe that you would admit that you want to stop him from being a good father.  You should be encouraging him to bond with his daughter as soon as possible, especially since you know he is a good person who will eventually accept his responsibilities.  Don't forget it could have been you that got pregnant by someone else.  His child is a part of him so if you really love him I would think you would be anxious to bond with his child yourself.  You sound as though you are very self centerd.  Maybe you should leave the poor guy alone if you don't care any more for him.  I think he is trying to leave some space between the two of you himself.|`|xIeW0zTHaa	I am a step-mother of 4 plus my own biological 3, my step-children are ages 28, 23, 21, and 16 and all four of them require their dads undivided attention, we haven't been married but  8 months and it has been HELL on wheels, and everybody that gives me advice tells me that I should be ashamed of myself, because I should know that children comes first before me, However my children ages 28,29, 30 are very supportive and only want my happiness would never interfere with whom I married, so if you know going into this relationship that you will have to take a backseat to the child as well as the child's mother then go for it, but if you are like me and it bothers you don't get involved anymore than you are. It really takes a special kind of person to be involved with someone who has children that are not your own and evidently I am not the one and I love children to death|`|211c888ebc2dc4af0e368207777268ddaa	He needs to start a relationship with his child now. it's what the baby deserves. You aren't accepting the child simply because of what it represents. You may funnelling your anger and pain over this situation towards the child. You are worried that once it isn't a long distance relationship between him and the other woman anymore, he will go back to this other woman.<br>  <br>  you two have a lot of talking to do. I think if my man told me i was free to go i'd be spitting fire. it seems like a passive-aggressive way to get a girl to break up with you - or you are being clingy and whiny and not listening to him tell you he loves only you, so he is giving up.|`|e3B9RMg0aa	If you truly love him, you will accept him, ALL of him. You can still have all that you two dreamed about, now you two can enjoy it all with a baby. That is a blessing. No good man is going to stay away from his child, and no good woman would want him to nor would a good woman wish him too.  People with children from other relationships fall in love all the time and are able to come together as one family. It doesn't sound like you love him, it sounds like you are obsessed with him. Figure out what your true feelings are for him and if you love him you HAVE to accept his daughter and be there for him AND her.

WdBCECa1aa	Hmmm, my boyfriend and I are also celebrating our one year anniversary at the end of the month ha. I would assume at the end of March in Ontario it's not extremely warm? So, taking a walk or doing something outside is kind of out of the question. I'm trying to see if there are any good shows or concerts going on. But that's just me...that's what my boyfriend and I always do on our spare time. I honestly don't know.  I would think just being together would be great. I would say watching a movie, but you could also do that afterward. And it would be much better if it was at one of you guys houses. So then sexy time would be easily accessible hahaha.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't help much!
15kiWTGQaa	talking as a full time college student, I know where ur coming from. Stress can be a killer and math just sucks. For your math class, just just talk to your teacher or see if you can get some of your class mates to do group studying or go to the tutoring center and ask for help. That's pretty much what I had to do with my math class, swallow my pride and ask for help. <br>  <br>  Walking can help relieve stress. Listening to music, reading a good book, exercising and such. <br>  <br>  Does your campus have a health center? usually they have some pamphlets or something or even someone you can talk too.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are eating and sleeping enough<br>  <br>  For me, the best way I relieve stress, is writing and listening to music.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps
3TobPBDOaa	compassionate love, always. And i don't think it's more important in marriage.

Q6Dyu1zKaa	Having married a woman who had three kids from her first marriage, I can relate (a little).  I have always made more money than my (now) wife, but it has never really been a problem for us.  The last few years have been rough ever since she was cut down to working only part time and I have been paying all the bills.  It's been hard sometimes to get a paycheck and see it gone almost right away.  But we tighten our expenses where we can and get through it.  She has just started a new job and some relief is on the way (which will be welcome after my paying more in federal taxes than she has made over the past couple of years).  <br>  <br>  I guess where I differ from "Vinny" is that I don't throw a mantrum over money.  Once we have everything we need to get through until the next paycheck we stay home and ride it out.  When it really starts to get to me I start looking at ways I can make more money, which my wife hates because then I'd spend even more time working than I do now.  Bottom line is that they add more to my life than the money I'd have if they weren't part of it.  That's the choice "Vinny" has to make, and if he doesn't realize that you and the kids do that then it is his loss (in my humble opinion).  He has a choice to make, and from the sounds of the point you are at it sounds like he is running out of time to make it or you are going to make it for him (he may look back on that with regret if he lets it happen that way).<br>  <br>  I guess the only advice I can give you is that you need to talk this out with him and remind him that this is only temporary until you finish school.  Even though that may take years, it is not forever.  If he can't handle that then ...<br>  <br>  Maybe start him off with a little humor about it:<br>  <br>  Q.  What is the definition of a Dad?<br>  A.  Someone that has pictures where money used to be.|`|naequcqlaa	Oh how well do I know the meaning of  "anxiety" & do take the same exact thing you do, have for 25 yrs.  Just could NOT get thru days w/o it.  I TOO know the feelings of those oh so "cutting" words that throw you into a nervous shaking wreck!  No, you do NOT have a job, BUT you ARE certainly contributing to your families welfare by keep a roof over your heads.   I mean what more could he ask in the way of you doing nothing?  NO, you surely ARE contributing to the welfare of your family.  What would he have to do IF he had to take on the added money that YOU contribute?  You in my book DO contribute to HIS welfare regardless of what he says.  You in NO WAY are  sitting on your rear end doing absolutely nothing, regardless of what he says.  I would have a serious talk w/him.  Pick the day he's in the "best of the better" moods he can be in, point out that you DO IN FACT contribute to the welfare of HIM & provide a roof over his head.  He at least does NOT have to be concerned over that.  That is one BIG thing.  Also, you are going to school to "BETTER" yourself so you'll at least have a career & not have to depend on "spastic" pays as he does.  After all is said & done, when you're out of school, you'll be able to provide for your family completely.  You ARE still young, yes you are.  You DO have a full life ahead of you.  There is NO reason whatsoever to have to put up w/what you're putting up with living w/hurting cutting words from the likes of him.  Come rite out & ask him IF he wants out from under all these "burdens" he feels he's under living w/you.  Ask him IF he does want to end this marriage, as it sure isn't bringing you any happiness that's for sure.  Ask him IF he wants to do a trial seperation, see how things work out w/that.  This would give him an idea if he CAN get along w/o you, OR if it suddenly "dawns" on him that you are "in fact" contributing to the family's welfare.  Put it all on him.  You do NOT deserve to be living the life of the "jitters" for no reason at all.  This is NOT for a happy life, a happy marriage.  See what his imput is on your suggestion & take it from there. But, IF he decides it's life WITH YOU, there are things that have got to change to make for happiness in your lifes.  I DO wish you ALL the best...:)|`|xhpAiWPvaa	get a job|`|UhbyuzuXaa	Ask yourself - Is living with you a Party? Nobodys perfect.

wbOrZjw1aa	It may not seem as shallow as it's coming across. I do find Internet relationships tricky as you can't always tell how the other person means something or where it's leading as you may in person. I understand you may feel let down after opening up to him so much though. Try not to blame yourself though. Doesn't seem your fault at all. He seems a little unreliable from the little I've read, but it's hard to tell.<br>  I must admit, even as a guy myself, I do sometimes find myself embarassed and even ashamed of how shallow some guys can be. But honestly, we're not all like that. Promise!<br>  Hope everything works out for you.|`|guvgG8tRaa	oh wow, first thing- dont instantly doubt yourself so much. he probably has a ligit reson for not being able to continue "talking", you must remember the internet is sketchy and for all you know he could be married, or a freak or something. make sure you are looking at the big picture and im sure you'll realize you have plenty of people to help you get through hard times. you seem like a smart individual, make sure you keep your head up.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	No, fortunately not all men are this shallow. Maybe you feel so let down because for a while you had someone you could connect with....and now you are grieving for that connection. As simple and uncomplicated as it was, it was probably a distraction from all the things in your life that are giving you pain right now. Stay strong; there are people out there who have the time and energy to give. Don't regret the goodness you got from it; just look for something better now. Good luck.|`|JCdBSULraa	How is that shallow? He just doesn't feel he's interesting to you.  If you give him verbal affirmation to let him know that you really do want to know more about him, he will be more open to share, but right now he thinks you're not interested or he has nothing to offer.
eEzDz4Pmaa	You can be married spiritually if you wish, and consider yourselves married in the eyes of god. There is no passage in the bible that speaks about the need for a marriage contract for the marriage to be valid in the eyes of god, just the need for a minister to conduct the ceremony, which can be problematical. It may be hard to find one that is willing to conduct the ceremony without the legal paperwork making it valid in the eyes of The Government.<br>  You must realize that you are then married in the eyes of god and will have to conduct yourselves accordingly.<br>  I urge you to get married on paper, even if you do it at a later time and as a simple courthouse wedding ( civil ceremony). Having your marriage recognized by the state is important in several ways you might have not considered. Getting married with a license will give your spouse death benefits, access to retirement funds, health insurance benefits, etc. As a legal spouse, you are allowed to make decisions regarding your spouse when they are injured or ill. ( you are considered next-of-kin). <br>  Please consider carefully before you decide to avoid the marriage license.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I've also asked this question because my fiance has debt and very bag credit. The Bible says to respect and honor the law unless it is asking you to contradict your spiritual belief. Otherwise, being married "spiritually" isn't any different than living together.|`|t4F59gf2aa	Then nobody will care but you.  MArriage and wedding-commitment for life-some made up hippie bs-nothing worthless, meaningless to God and the USA and probably everyone else in the world.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	I totally agree with moonwolf, marriage is a union of two souls...'God' blesses every union. <br>  <br>  I got legally married once. When it's over it's over who needs church and state to disssolve a soul contract which was between both souls and God to begin with? Makes no sense to me.<br>  <br>  I would never, i mean NEVER, again get married in a chuch. Love is my God.|`|ruczpWrGaa	It all depends on your views.  You can get a commitment ceremony.  That doesn't have to be legal.  But if you are so concern with the whole in gods eyes thing then you might as well get the license.|`|AA11401294	yes you can|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	If you love each other and want to be together in the eyes of God, no piece of paper or ceremony needs to tell you what you already know. You can be married spiritually, how do you think people got married before Christianity and its rules?|`|0tusTThyaa	Talk with your pastor. Why would you NOT want to be lawfully wed?? You get no benefits...nothing...absolutely nothing.<br>  <br>  My guess is the only reason for NOT wanting to be lawfully wed, is so you can run away easier when it doesn't work out. And wed in God's eyes means to be LAWFULLY wed.<br>  <br>  Wedding and divorces occured in the bible, and it was law.|`|Bq51x58jaa	if u want to be married in gods eyes then u have to marry in a church and u will have to get a marriage licence if u marry in a church so sorry no.|`|Hl8KNCLMaa	Yes, I think you can. I had a friend who had an Indian marriage ceremony (very cool).

My friends always call me fat (we have this sort of joke where we call everyone fat, even if they aren't remotely fat) and I don't get angry.<br>  <br>  Fat jokes are only in bad taste if the person in question is fat, and the joke is aimed to offend. Otherwise, I don't see the harm.|`|WhmyV0Vxaa	I take it as your friend is jellous by you. First off tell you have a problem with the fact that she called you fat. Also tell her that friends don't put other friends down. And if she has a problem with this then I geuss you gys arent true friends. Thats when you dump her.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|JbM5lnYhaa	i say c<br>  <br>  and i think its better for girls 2 have a fat ***|`|aUosbTqqaa	dumop her, she's not good. she's just jealouse and if she were a real frind she wouldn't say it.|`|zVh8by4Raa	A|`|dARgbG8Saa	hmmmmmm i guess c im a 12 in the us so ya fine
TTjDATeOaa	Because they don't want to be with them anymore, and it's easier than asking for a divorce (or else they asked for a divorce and told them they didn't want to be there anymore and the spouse acted like nothing happened). Just like in dating, guys are cowards when it comes to hurting people with the truth. They would rather be a dick than to just have the guts to say it!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	There's a few insightful comments for you to consider. Here are a few more. <br>  <br>  Your marital vows, to be with your partner, and only your partner in an intimate and loving way, is a moral commitment. There are legal aspects to violating these vows, and those issues show during the divorce. We make these moral commitments and by so doing, we surrender certain 'freedoms'. Such as the freedom to be with another partner in a sexual and intimate way. If we don't come to terms with our need for personal freedom before we make these moral commitments, we struggle with these issues throughout the course of our marriage. This often shows itself as well, in the differences between healthy relationships, and unhealthy relationships.<br>  <br>  There's a medical explanation for these feelings. The basic theory is that the brain is the primary sex organ. Research has expanded that.<br>  <br>  Sexual arousal (lust) and romantic love activate quite distinct areas of the brain—and love is clearly the more powerful. The latter turns on dopamine-rich regions linked with motivation, and falling in love is not unlike the rush of taking cocaine, hence the addictiveness of a new crush, and the withdrawal-like symptoms of love lost.<br>  <br>  This also partly explains why people who have lost a loved one seem to have things in common with a drug addict going through withdrawal. In that sense, being in love is like being insane. It also explains why some people get 'addicted to love' or have affairs. They are like drug addicts this way. In fact, many who are addicted to porn experience this phenomenon.<br>  <br>  Those are aspects of cheating that have certain visual clues for you to observe. They get that love struck look in their eyes, and they start to hide their 'drug of choice' and any evidence of her.<br>  <br>  Another more interesting and in depth study produced these results.<br>  <br>  The study of romance - particularly the study of our brains in various stages of romance - has become a serious academic pursuit. It seems that every year, more lovesick brains are scanned, more sweaty garments are sniffed for pheromone responses, more affairs are cross-checked against menstrual charts. Science stands on the brink of telling us everything there is to know about love. Will we like what we hear?<br>  <br>  The regions of activity in the lovers' brains didn't much resemble those of people feeling other strong emotions, such as anger or fear; instead, they looked like the euphoric brains of people high on cocaine. It would have been sweet vindication for Robert Palmer - cue the swelling synthesizers and the babes in black minidresses, because we might as well face it: We're addicted to love.<br>  <br>  Lust, love and attachment: All are accounted for in our frenzied brains. According to Fisher, that's because these are three neurological drives as potent as hunger and thirst, each serving to control a different aspect of reproduction. Lust emerged to encourage us to get frisky with almost any suitable sexual partner. Because that can be exhausting, romantic love developed so we would focus our efforts on one partner. And since a baby's chances of survival would improve with two parents, attachment evolved to keep our ancestors together.<br>  <br>  These reproductive drives might also account for the differences Fisher perceived in male and female brain scans. Unsurprisingly, men showed more activity in regions associated with visual processing, especially of the face. This may be because shiny hair, smooth skin, white teeth and a strong body all indicate a healthy woman with good child-bearing possibilities. It may also explain why more men than women say they believe in love at first sight.<br>  <br>  Studies have shown that during ovulation, a woman appears more attractive to men and tends to be guarded more vigilantly by her partner. From a cold Darwinian perspective, that sounds about right: She is signalling her fertility, and, if a man doesn't want to raise another guy's baby, he'd better keep his woman close.<br>  <br>  Researchers from New Mexico took this show on the road, looking for the "first real-world economic evidence of male sensitivity to cyclic changes in female attractiveness." On the page, that sounds dryly academic; in reality, they headed for a gentleman's club. The team asked lap dancers to monitor their menstrual periods, their work shifts and their tips for 60 days. The results are astonishing. Ovulating dancers pulled in US$70 an hour; those in the middle of their cycle made $50; and menstruating dancers took home a lowly $35 an hour. Now here's the caveat: Those are the statistics for normally cycling women. Dancers who took the birth-control pill saw no mid-cycle increase in their tips. But Pill users made an average of only $193 per five-hour shift, while the other women pocketed $276 - which means that patrons found them less attractive to the tune of 16 bucks an hour.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	There is no one reason, sometimes it's even just a matter of opportunity. That's why I think it is a bad idea for spouses to go to bars, clubs etc. without their partner.If you don't have a lot of will power and  love and  respect for your spouse , you could be drunk and your decision making out of whack and cheat. I think a lot of people do it for the thrill of forbidden love, exciting sex and no obligations to the one you're cheating with. I also think some people are just habitual cheaters (not addicted to sex, I don't believe in that) because they constantly need confirmation of their sexual prowess,   ability to attract the opposite sex and to boast low self esteem.Some  people no  longer love their spouses but out of cowardice to do the right thing and get a divorce  or admit what you've done, they stay in the marriage and have the best of both worlds, a wife to take care of the home front and the other woman for exciting sex. Sometimes it's financial reasons. I'm starting to rant now but you get the idea. It's really hard to name a sign of cheating that would fit everyone..unless it's lipstick on his collar but most women are able to pick up on the smallest indication of cheating.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Lack of commitment, honor, and/or self-discipline on the part of the cheater.  Marry a man who is committed to you, honorable, and self-disciplined, and you won't have to worry about cheating a day in your life.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	not getting enough attention<br>  revenge for  cheating on them<br>  drifting apart<br>  slutty behaivor<br>  those are just a few|`|cGGvZqJNaa	Ask Chelsea the Deer hunter|`|MjSLQlIHaa	not sexually fulfilling their partner's needs!|`|XrtmT2kUaa	There are a lot of reasons. Maybe they feel like they are getting old and a younger person pays them attention or they are stuck in a marriage they don't know how to get out of. It could be something as simple as feeling lonely. Truthfully there is no good reason to cheat on your spouse. If you are that unhappy then you need to make a change before you do something that extreme.|`|V0qntsyZaa	Men and women work in lateral positions now.  In the past it was usually the boss banging his secretary purely for sex for him and stupid or job protection for her.  <br>  <br>  Working side by side, successfully completing assignments, traveling together for seminars/conventions/on-site customer meetings and having breaks and lunch together may bring about a bond that can easily move into an "emotional affair" and slip into the physical from there.<br>  <br>  There are signs this is going on...  <br>  If you call him at work and he always had the time for you and now he has no time or is impatient with you.<br>  If he used to in conversation mention all his co-workers and now he never mentions one particular of the opposite sex and if he does mention her it seems he is pre-reviewing what he is saying.<br>  If he is certain he told you something important and you are certain he did not he is confused about who he told.<br>  Longer working hours with no increase on the pay stub if he is an hourly worker.<br>  Whistling on his way to work after he spent plenty of time in front of the mirror when in the past he hated to go to work.<br>  New sharper clothes, especially underwear, and a more trendy haircut.<br>  His car is now cleaner and free of wife and child clutter.<br>  <br>  I hope none of the above raise the yellow or worse the red flag.  This type affair does happen sometimes with there being nothing wrong in the marriage.  Familiarity breeds...|`|ibeYAlwpaa	because they're smutastic.<br>  not enough attention, Not beinf sexually, and or emotionally satisfied, because the oppurtunity presents itself and they have no will power.|`|B1MnNcI8aa	they've treated their wives like poo, or they didn't invest the time to be close and intimate in a non-sexual way which leads to becoming less intimate with their wives.

They cheat because the 20 to 5% their mate is missing this person has. The most common reason for men and most women is boring sex, over a period of time you will get tired of having sex with your mate, I suggest a trip to the adult store, and for both of you once you get to that point to explore each other. Most of all have fun during sex, never do the same position more than twice a week. Do not have sex everyday, that will make sex like eating breakfast its just something you need to do. I think you should always try new positions, new places, just let go and enjoy.|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	Because when they get married its for better or for ...but mostly people really mean for better and when the worse happens the commitment seems to much.And like its unresolvable.But i can tell you the grass isn't greener on the other side...its just starting all over again only to repeat the same mistakes because you have an intimacy issue with excepting the other person for who they really are instead of trying to change that person...no one will EVER be perfect.|`|0tusTThyaa	Needs not being met. Read His Needs/Her Needs, easy $20 book at the store. When you fail to met your spouse's needs, you leave him/her vulnerable for an affair. So it's BOTH fault.

You haven't listed any reasons why you might or might not be interested. The fact that he dumped you would typically go under Might Not, but since you are considering getting back together that obviously didn't piss you off too much. <br>  <br>  It could turn out very well, I'm sure you realize that. You must also be aware that if he dumped you once he can dump you twice. But you run the risk of getting dumped no matter who you go out with. It's a matter of whether you want to take your chances with a guy who has already disappointed you once.|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	There isn't enough details for us to look at, but if he dumped you, it has better have been something really good, like his mother was dying and he didn't have time to spend with you right then.<br>  <br>  Have self respect, and make him either ear your trust again, or just walk away.
lwkv7pJBaa	Your mother is going through puberty, give her space, she will have rebellious moments such as these. Mood swings and such are common in these years.

Show her your support, and that you care for her.You will both get over it with love.|`|ls7tcUpiaa	I would talk to the boyfriend...nicely and say that you think that your mom would like to spend some time at his place sometimes...and if that doesn't work i would go be with a relative, or say to your mom that she will lose you if she doesn't find a balance.|`|bolkuGgVaa	Ugh, this happened to me when I was younger and i was so annoyed. My mom's boyfriend would sleep on our couch in the living room and we couldn't watch TV or do anything because he was ALWAYS there. I feel for you. I would tell your mom that you are sad and you want alone time with her. Just be honest. Most moms would be touched by that. If it doesn't work, nicely talk to her boyfriend and explain how you feel. Hopefully he is understanding and he and your mom can work something out. I think it is really sweet you want to spend time with your mom. Good luck with this!|`|wFq02jAVaa	I have learned from my own experiences that talking is the best method to getting your feelings and thoughts out and into the other person(s) view. However, it sounds as if you have already tried that. <br>  <br>  As for you getting alone time, it sounds as if he only comes during the weekend, so you should have time to yourself then... correct?<br>  <br>  Also, it sounds as if your mom is hooked on this guy. With all relationships, they eventually mellow out into a more calm and passive state. Give your mom some time with this, and if you want to talk to your mom talk about her new man. See what all the fuss is about, all in all, it is something to talk about and it may help her from going into the "bitchy" state you mentioned.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Yea I would have a talk with the bf..<br>  sounds like he is unaware.<br>  also make a date with your mom .. and tell her you want some girl time.<br>  SOUNDS LIKE she is in that new stage with the bf and eventually it will cool down... or they will break up.<br>  You don't say how old you are... but getting out on your own might be the only solution....<br>  women like to be in their own bed not in the guys dirty sludgy apt.<br>  <br>  so like others said ... talk with the bf and ask him to have her come to his place once in a while.|`|kPKKyZluaa	I would tell her how you feel. Like she has no interest in you two spending quality time together any more. Don't tell her to do something, just explain your feelings and ask her for a compromise. She is in love and just wants you to get use to him being around just encase he is the new guy. Let her know you understand her feelings too so it does not seem you want this guy out of her life for good.
MtbaNz5Yaa	question whats with the name?<br>     How old are you and have you considered that your mom knows that you are going to leave her soon "from her point of view" and her bf will be the only one with her.<br>    This is a sad part of growing up with a single parent but I am sure that you will do well and remember to apply what you have learned when you are the parent|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	I really think the best thing for you to do is to have a serious honest talk with your mum. Sit down with her and let her know how hurt you feel and how you only just want to spend time with her. See if you could go stay with a friend for awhile to try and prove a point if she diesn't listen. Good luck xx

Maybe a book about his favorite topic/hobbies. Has he mentioned anything he wants lately? A favorite video game, movie, etc...<br>  I try to buy a fun thing and a good thing.

At this point you should know what your husband likes, but it wouldn't hurt to experiment some to keep it exciting and fresh. Just get some lingerie you'd think you'd look sexy in and stop overanalyzing it.|`|pJQd5Rxwaa	I would definitely get some.  He would probably appreciate the pleasant surprise when he gets home.

Bottom line: You're Tired which means you don't want to put any effort into your relationship because effort takes energy. You're only giving her chances because you're comfortable with what you know and any change will cause you to freak out (even just a little bit). Ok yes, almost everyone deserves a 2nd chance.. but not 4. You're caught up in an unhealthy relationship and in the end it's only going to screw you both up. She obviously has you on a leash.. you need to stop being insecure and stop being a doormat. "Just Say No"|`|QvhPJAKyaa	tell her that then.|`|cmEi3CVqaa	get tough and tell her where to go. tell her if she can't be a good friend then you don't want to know her and that you've got other friends you'd rather be with. she will get the picture, even if she later comes back saying she's sorry, be cautious bcoz she may not be able to help herself and may treat u badly again. and to be honest 4 chances is a lot!! <br>  <br>  when you with other people around her show her what a good time you're having with people who can respect you and people who you respect. she will soon realise her mistakers and if shes not that good a friend then whats the loss? if anything its her loss and her fault so let her get on with it while you aren't paying her any attention and having fun elsewhere :)<br>  <br>  hope it helps x|`|TBD6SPaTaa	Hey there,rox-4eva.  You did set her straight,Right?  Then that should be it.  It shouldn't take a rocket scientist to realize that it is over between the two of you.  I see what she is doing.  She is trying to wear you down.  She is trying to make you feel guilty over what you had done.  That's right.  4 chances.  4 chances for her to change her ways.  But did she ever change her ways?  All she has done was con you into taking her back so she can push you around and abuse you some more.  You've done the right thing,Babe.  Don't give in to her.  Order her to stop bothering her.  You need to put your foot down.  And to all those kids who ask you why you don't just accept her apology and take her back.  Ask them if they would do the same if the shoe was on the other foot.  Just going around being a human carpet for people to walk all over.  Let people abuse you and push you around.  I know you are tired.  I'd be tired of hearing her apologies and excuses too.  Hon,There's just so much I can do for you.  It's up to you to finish this.  I know you don't want to,But you must put your foot down and set her straight.  It's the only way you'll be able to get rid of her.  I hope this helps you out somewhat.  If not,I am terribly sorry.  I've gotta run along soon.  You have a goodnight and God bless.  Bye for now.|`|ejosT3OVaa	The way I see it I think EVERYONE should get a second chance. No matter how horrible of a thing they did, but thats just me.<br>  <br>  But Just straight up tell her. I can't keep giving you chance if you are not going to change. Then she will pull the "I PROIMISE I'll change" card and thats when you put your foot down and say "Oh well" SHe'll realize one day , hopefully.

Many people older than you are moving back because of the hard times. Entire families are moving back in w/ each other just to get by.<br>  <br>  If you have debt, don't accrue anymore. You'll never get out of the hole. Try to work and pay off your loans. Try to live w/ your parents as long as you can in order to save a little. <br>  <br>  Debt will crush you and follow you everywhere - pay it off!
DcrI9zmkaa	You aren't going to like my my answer; but, the fact is, none of this is any of your business.  If you can't continue being friends with this woman because you are so upset over her household situation, that's your choice.  You, however, have no business trying to lay blame or anything else.  The situation is none of your concern...just move on.|`|MfUMaKcDaa	wow thats kinda a sad story. those kids are gonna grow up probably pretty weirdly. it doesnt sound like a very happy family, but it could still work if she left the men and got a good job and good house on her own with the kids.|`|vvlrWizxaa	Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!|`|5M0yL2G9aa	Wow! i don't even know what to say....the mother should definitely go home and talk to her daughter and kick those boys out of her house...i know you say they are men but they are acting like boys. otherwise she is gonna be taking care of 8 babies and on maury povich to see who daddy is|`|GxSnVRAOaa	Wow!  When I hear stories like these I am likely to say "That poor girl's mother," but in this situation it sounds like the mother was pretty aware of what was going on.  I hate to blame anyone in situations like these, but it sounds like that mother would have to put her foot down at some point.  It's bad enough to allow your daughter to get pregnant the first time (I say allow because she let an older man move in and sleep with her daughter) but to provide her and her men with living situations through three babies at age 18 is completely unacceptable.  That girl, who is now raising three kids of her own, will never grow up if her mother doesn't get her out of the house and into the real world.  Guess what, in the real world, it's freaking hard to take care of 3 babies when you don't live at Mom's house.  I know that's harsh, especially as there are children invovled.  She just needs to make it really clear "I will help with the kids, I will always be their grandmother, but I can't be responsible for you and them when you aren't responsible for yourself."  We had to do that with my younger sister-  my father took custody away over a year ago and he still has custody of my Nephew.  Only now is my sister going through the motions of putting her life back on track.  Sometimes these kids just need a kick in the a**.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	The mother is def to blame. By allowing the boyfriends to move in with her daughter, she is saying "hey go ahead, do what you want".<br>  <br>  I imagine that the daughter's father isn't around either....|`|bcM7Lxpeaa	your not wrong that is a mess i to have family in similar situation but not quit so bad<br>  but to answer your question it is partly the mothers fault for not getting the so called men arrested and alot the girls fault for popping out kids right and left the mother cant watch her all the time and kids will do it behind your back if they cant in front of your face that being said she does not have to make it easy er for her either even if she would do it anyways she could still make it hard and press charges against the men|`|DqkVB9jgaa	Whattttt|`|CaqdDzQZaa	is the friend really you????????<br>  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......<br>  it sounds that way to me|`|7z9eKO2maa	i think you're to blame, you haven't talked to your friend earlier. i'm joking, but seriously, it could be proven as your fault. you knew what was happening the whole time and didn't do anything about it, you're her friend, STAND IN AS THE ADULT WITH THE ADVISE... god. you shouldn't even be asking this, you chose not to do anything before baby 1, 2, or 3, how did you work up the nerve to look at it as inappropriate when YOU DIDN'T STOP IT... ugh, adults these days.|`|CTgG9ENyaa	personally i don't think anyone is to blame, unless of course the men she was with persuaded her ti get pregnant and have their children then it is entirely their fault, but maybe she'd be better talking to a friend or someone like you rather than going straight to therapy<br>  <br>  She could just be lonely in all honesty and may think the babies will keep her company or they might keep her and whatever partner she is with together, just talk to her and she what she has to say, but don't come on too strongly she may feel threatened and then she won't open up to you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  xx|`|RoyvUWl7aa	OMG...what is wrong with this mother? I would have had the first guy arrested to try and stop this.I had my only  child at 30...I CANT imagine having one at16...insane!<br>  The mother doesn't seem like she has control over her daughter. Mom probalby needs to talk to someone , if she truly cares because mom is mom and doesn't /hsn't done a good job if her young daughter already had 3 different babies by 3 different daddies...screwed up!|`|eR8onj8Haa	i think this situation got screwed up when she had another baby with another guy when she was only 17. <br>  i think this girl needs to see some kind of therapist. <br>  your a good friend for sticking by her side and shes probably gonna need a lot of help getting out of this mess:( i think that its sorta your friends fault for letting guy #1 and guy #2 have sex with her in the first place. than getting pregnant agian with baby #3. i think the two men need to move out and she should have help with the babies from her family. <br>  i wish you both good luck and i will hope for the better for her. <br>  with lotta luv to the babies and her!|`|qetHGs3Paa	In all honesty? I blame her daughter.  I had my son at 15.  Yes I said 15.  His dad was 18.  Now when you have a child you mature and learn your lesson as I did.  My mom was around but no one knew I was having sex.  This is her daughter's life.  Me personally however, I would blame the girl.  The law about minor's and men is different in every state and changes as new cases comes in.  So where I live VA. When I was 15 they could not charge him for Statutory Rape because he was within 4 years of me.  (that was how the law was then) The girl should already know how to protect herself from well herself.  I only have 1 child and I am now 22.  Having him has been a lesson I don't want to repeat until I am married.  She obviously did not learn.  Tell your friend to try to make Ms. Little 17 to pay her own bills and daycare as I did and see what happens.   Also tell her to kick out homeboy and get him on the child support papers.  (wherever he may get a job they will take it out his check.IF HE EVER GETS OFF THE COUCH).  And tell Ms. 17 to keep her leggs closed she might be able to get further in the future.  Sorry I don't mean to be mean but some underage moms are just so incredibly dumb and it makes us good ones look horrible.  Thanks
OX8T6o2yaa	My advice to you is to try to talk to him and hang out w/ him, find ur similar interests/goals, if he prove that he is god enough for u then you should try to tell him your feelings.  Don't try wearing revealing clothes..that gives them the wrong ideas and u seriously don't want that. If you be yourself around him im sure he will like you back, if it doesn't happen instantly don't worry and give it some time. If ur really shy try to start a conversation w/ him...it's scary at first but it will be totally worth it.<br>  <br>  If ppl tell u ur nice and pretty beleive them. im much like you shy and quiet and ppl give tonz of compliments but i dont beleive them cuz i don't have much confidence.  Be confident around him(but not to confident). Flirting lightly always helps but dont come off as desperate.<br>  <br>  Work your way up from friends and see where that gets ya.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Talk to him. Try to find common interests with him. Common ground is the easiest way to build rapport with someone. Be light and breezy when you talk to him, keep conversations simple. Talk about superficial things.<br>  <br>  If he proves he is worthy, then bring up deeper things, like your feelings for him.|`|Q7DXrxMTaa	To make him notice you you need to talk to him. Simple as that.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't know you properly chances are that he wouldnt do anything about liking you even if he does.<br>  <br>  So you need to talk to him at school and online and find out about him. <br>  <br>  If you've been told your pretty and nice then its clearly true<br>  <br>  Just go for it!! Whats the worse that could happen??|`|x1ByRFHXaa	okay,heres the scoop. :)<br>  be flirtatious.when he wants you,dont let him have all of you,<br>  but give in a little bitt.haa.play,irresistable,and hard to get.but at the same time,stay focused,interested,and in it to win it.where a fragrance thats hard to forget,and when you hug him,notice if he complements? keep a sexy appearence,and unforgettable personality.maintain,and stay true to who you really are though.believe it or not,boys like girls,who are natural,reall,honest,and have a certain beauty about thats not just inner,but relatable. :D .<br>  he's sure to love you if you do.|`|OhKl0BAVaa	start talking to him about anything! im a guy and there have been girls that i know tried to get me to notice them and i DID, talk to to him it makes the difference. If  this guys smart he prolly knows your after him jus go for it dude.|`|nZjdi0wKaa	hang around him and start from his knee up to wherever you want to stop. wear different things to catch his attention. yeah, it does work!!! on me and i think others too but i can't be wrong|`|yFwc1RqNaa	wear nothing to school
AA12234214	ok first of all let me say i've been in your exact boat and we've been together for 7 yrs. He would actually go on the website and talk to these disgusting obese women when I look better then all of them put together. i should have stopped it when we were dating but i didn't and then it got worse. DON'T BELIEVE IT NO OTHER WEBSITE CAN GET YOUR INFORMATION FROM A WEBSITE HE'S TAKING YOU FOR A RIDE. it doesn't matter if it has basic info he could've just done it to look at other women or to chat he doesn't need to put a profile up. trust me hun don't let this slip it's going to get worse and you will later find that he's into these websites and on porn talking to other women. RUN RUN the other way don't let it slip because he will then think that you forgave him once then twice so you will forgive him again, that's what i did, i forgave him once twice 10 times!!! and now we are on the verge of divorce SEVEN YEARS LATER!<br>  Good luck and I hope it all works out.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I have not heard of that.  Could be possible though.|`|HHB9LUqiaa	I hate to say this but he is probably lying.  i have found the same thing with my husband.  the first time he lied and swore up and down he didnt know how it got there.. then 2nd time he said he was sorry and it would never happen again.. and fessed up about lying the first time.. now i have found it AGAIN and now i dont trust him at all.. again he SWEARS he dosnt know how it happened.. but really.. 3 times.. come on.. fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me... and now.. three strikes and your out... so again i hate to say it but as with my hubs hes probably lying to see if you will let him get away with it...|`|LS8LcuRaaa	There are white label dating sites. Website owners sign up and get access, pick their own domain and get access to their profiles. So it's possible that different websites have the same profile. But these dating sites tend to be rather small and unknown. The big dating sites don't have access to each others profiles. You need to sign up on each website. However, some of them don't check ID's so it's possible that someone else can set up the profile. But I'd say that's unlikely. Why would his friend set up several dating profiles for him?|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Odds are extremely high he's lying.  And you're letting him get away with playing the "You can't prove I did it" game.
hF6uZqWRaa	$160 is not too much but for pants?? uumm maybe. I wouldn't spend that much on jeans. Why dont you get him something that means something since it your anniversary? I would get him those jeans for bday or christmas. I got my bf a ring once, a necklace, a braclet uummm something when he sees it it will remind him of you. :) hope this helps.|`|AA10928214	No? Crap I spend way more than that. If you go to Dinner, the movies, flowers, and a gift, it's more than that.

zG4QCxK7aa	okay girl... ive been in the exact same situation and firstly: CHILL! give the guy a break! you both are upset and maybe it seems like he doesn't care but have you ever thought that he might have some shiite on his mind right now too? maybe he still likes you and is trying to work that out aswell! don't cling on to him like you need him so much you can't live without him, it's bad to do that! okay ill tell you what i did, coz when i started to act that upset you are now to him, it only drew us even further apart! he even started to ignore me, and he felt like he tried so much to make things right everytime but that i wouldnt forgive him and that it was never good enough for me! would you like him to think and do the same? so anyways eventually i thought that he really did not care about me anymore and he and me started to ignore eachother after having such fights... so then for about 14 weeks of me crying my eyes out and him giving me weird and awkward looks, my friend told him i could really use a friend coz i was going through a pretty tough situation.. he started to talk to me a bit but not directly in the eye coz he was afraid that i would reject him or something, and then i started to talk to him again and we started to have fun again.. now its a while later and he shares secrets with me, cares for me, teases me a lot (can be quite annoying but better than not having it) so love wot i think you need to do is just accept the situation for now, and let things cool down, do not be angry to your friend, always stay nice, forgiveness is the greatest thing you could ever give to someone, and it seems like you care a lot about him so maybe you should give him this favour, but do not say i forgive you, do not make it his fault, since You are in this too and it is not only him who needs to step up and do something or come and talk to you, he is a guy after all and may need some time and may find it hard! once it has cooled down and he hasnt talked to you yet, slowly try to be nice to him but do not refer to what has happened, this has to be in the past now, the only way is to forgive him and if you dont want to do this and youve had enough maybe you should forget about him and move on, but seeing from your story this does not seem to be in your interested, i think although you might not like to admit it, you might still like him, i have the same love, im still not over him, but at least i can live with it now! and his staring could be explained for that he just does not know wot to do when he sees you! and what he said is true, he is scared that you will start screaming and making a hassle again when all he is doing is staying callm, this could be a LOT worse honestly, at least he isnt being mean to you, so dont make him do that!! i relle relle hope this helps!!!|`|pWqkGJl1aa	its too long|`|R2teBtllaa	he dosnt care so let him go,find somebody else who will make u happy,,this guys is an ***
7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	If you can't look him in the face, you are sending him a "go away" signal.  So, it's natural he is talking to other girls.  You are pushing him away.<br>  <br>  The fact that you get depressed when he does flirt with other girls is that you miss his attention.<br>  <br>  You had your cake, but he's trying to not show that he ate cake to everyone that you work with.  And you are basically acting like you don't want more cake, so he feels he can hang with others.<br>  <br>  Either make the relationship official, or move on.<br>  <br>  And this is why most folks don't date at work.  If anything goes wrong, even something minor like it just isn't working, it creates problems.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	Hes keeping work and his relationship separate.<br>  <br>  Thats normal and this is why you don't date your co workers.<br>  <br>  80 percent of my friends are girls, I even stay the night with a few (we do nothing) and I have a Gf who wouldn't really think twice on it.|`|nZjdi0wKaa	hahahahahahahaha you believe him!! but anyway, he doesn't want the relationship to be publicly known or people will gossip about him and he'll like get something
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Hell no!  Haven't you seen the commercials?  You'll end up playing in a sh1tty band at a pirate themed restaurant!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Jili, I'm worried about you, you've seemed so...tame lately...|`|qsLhVZd8aa	I did.  Not a big deal.  Everything is now paid off and we bought a new home and car last year.  Bad credit doesn't last forever.  BUT, I looked into his credit before and after his divorce.  He didn't have bad credit until after he married and he had been cleaning it up since she left, so he wasn't the problem in the first place.|`|ZyXTngiCaa	That'd be a hard one to call unless I was actually in the situation. Sometimes love just trumps all. That's a tough one though..so many variables to consider.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My husband's credit is terrible.  But, I love him very much.  It doesn't matter to me right at this moment.|`|AVcTCrSGaa	It depends how bad we're talking about.  If they're buried up to their eye balls in debt and that's why their credit is bad, I would seriously rethink marrying them.  Because once you're married, this can become your responsibility.  If their credit is bad just because a few payments were missed, that can be fixed.  I would want them to try to fix their bad credit before we married.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Absolute not! I did and it was the worse thing I ever did. His bad spending habits continued after we got married. I went from having good credit to bad, because of him. After I divorced him it took me years to clean up my credit. I now have good credit again and I plan on it staying that way.<br>  <br>  A smart person thinks with their heart and brain, when they get married. A fool thinks love is all that matters. WRONG! I will never allow myself again to be a fool in love. <br>  <br>  If I ever decide to get married again, I will do a complete credit and criminal check on the person before I say "I do." Next time I am going to know ahead of time, exactly what I'm getting.<br>  <br>  Having bad credit says a lot about a person. Some times it's because they were laid off from work and the bills became over due before they got another job. But for some people, it's a personality problem. They are irresponsible, try to live above their means, won't stay steadily employed, and they just don't and won't see the big picture.<br>  <br>  As the saying goes. Buyer beware and that goes for love and marriage too.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	I could care less. My husband was a year out from bankruptcy when we got married. However I learned a long time ago that money does not buy love or happiness. My ex had a great income and perfect credit but he was still a violent abusive jerk.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	Nah, its not about money. for me anyway.<br>  <br>  I mean everyone has the right to fall in love and get married..no matter how their credit is. I consider that extremely selfish otherwise.|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	it depends on the person and the situation.  all bad credit is not the results of being irresponsible.|`|B1MnNcI8aa	Well, don't most marriages end because of money?  If that's true, then bad credit is a predictor.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Nope!|`|AU3HVTToaa	no|`|AA12306587	I have bad credit and my husband married me. He had fair credit and I married him. What do finances have to do with love? However, I understand the need to ask this question and it is a smart one to ask before considering marriage. Today's economy is just frightful. If you really love a person help them clean it up before you get married.|`|211c888ebc2dc4af0e368207777268ddaa	No - then your credit is bad as well. Once you are married, the law assigns you the bad credit too.<br>  <br>  the credit issue should be cleared up first, before marriage, so it doesn't follow you the rest of your lives. Both people need to learn how to prevent bad credit from happening again in the future.|`|UNy6gzzwaa	yes i would couse i didnt marry them  for their money  just becouse they dont have good credit dont mean  they  are bad lol  i would  be kinda afraid to know how their credit got  so bad though   but still the same i would marry them if i loved them|`|cyk4WSjjaa	It depends on what kinda of future your looking for. Like if you want to buy a house right away then that puts a damper on the lifestyle you may want to live. Don't force yourself into a beer lifestyle and you have Champagne dreams.|`|OYD5QqBfaa	Yes, although chances of the marriage working out i think would be alot slimmer. Both my spouse and i are 100% debt free and money in our relationship usually isn't a problem.|`|UImlNXd2aa	I did its not that big of a deal. Credit can always be built up again.|`|VkpFImx4aa	Hell no. How are they gonna be able to buy me stuff?|`|oArttDYQaa	it doesnt matter if you llove him|`|jdRKZe18aa	Not a black & white answer - maybe Yes,Maybe No.  It would depend on why they have the bad credit  #1 and #2 it would depend on how clearly they were showing they have changed their bad habits and have set new goals and a new direction for the future.  If they haven't - then you are walking into a situation that will then make your own credit bad and that isn't a good thing to knowingly do either.  There could be some long term ramifications of that as well.<br>  <br>  In this economy lots of people are struggling, so this isn't as easily answered as one would think..... BUT in general someones credit shows their responsibility, ethics and over all good character -  but that's a very GENERAL answer....|`|PvAIY7OPaa	to be brutally honest I wouldn't!
Jg8Xenc2aa	hey,<br>  firstly don't listen to these idiots telling you to change religion.<br>  love is not something that is restricted in any religion.<br>  its a feeling that everyone gets at some point in life.<br>  of course there are somethings about love that are restricted for example in islam it is haram ( forbidden) to have sex before marriage, if you think bout that logically u will understand that it is haram for your own protection e.g having unwanted children which could lead to abortions which is a sin in any religion.<br>  my advice to u is so get to know people e.g close friends or colleagues that you might have feelings for, they only way for u to know if u like or love someone is to know them and understand them.<br>  dont worri even though youve never dated before im 100% certain you will find your love its just a matter of time.<br>  hpe this helped u in any way<br>  good luck|`|l77grfgVaa	I guess its not forbidden to go out and meet people. Ofcourse u'll meet somebody who u like and feel attached to even if u dont admit it to him.If u have a group of friends like all going out together u can talk to him without doing anything that breaks the rules. Simple talking. I guess if he likes u too he'll tell u and then he'll ask u to marry him/be his fiancee if he loves u enough as to want u as his life companion. He'll know he must do that and he'll probably be a muslim too i guess.|`|2YtoVVDtaa	Dear,<br>  Islam give the lesson to control your feelings for sex. and only way you have love is marry in islam. if you find any alternate way that is HARAM. if you control for some time that your feelings will be suppressed. try to control your self. i also dont have great knowledge on Islam but basic questions you can ask me any time.<br>  <br>  regards,<br>  <br>  me|`|vxf7bo7oaa	Well you can wait for the right time. Or you can ask your parents to look for a man for you. You dont have to be that strict , just make sex not an option for you.|`|bnRKolhuaa	Why would you ask a question like that if you know it's not an option. A real Muslim would not ask such a question. Call 1-800 I am a new Muslim and not sure of my options.|`|nZjdi0wKaa	take off your headband head thing and go watch some tyra banks show you know make up legs, lipstick, all those things bikinis are normal in america|`|8TOAWToiaa	you could join one of those muslim online dating sites.|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	it seems like there would be no way to get around this unless you break the rules of your religon|`|pWoMaxwkaa	Don't listen to those ignorant people that say that you should convert. I'm a Muslim and I live in America , and I'm not very religious and I don't wear headscarf but I hope I can make the habit of wearing one when I'm older. Its great that you do , respect be to you. But I know my mothers going to pick someone out for me , and I will have to approve for sure. But I know I will not go out of my way to find a boyfriend , I will wait for him to find me. Islam doesn't prohibit love marriages , you better know that. Heard of that story of Yusuf and Julekha. Remember when Julekha was the wife of a king and she saw Yusuf and fell in love with him because of his beauty , and then she divorced the king to be with him later on. You see , he will find you , you don't need to find him , you'reee the queen. When the right man comes , you wont need to chase him , he will chase you. <br>  <br>  I can tell you're very sweet.<br>  <br>  <br>  That idiot with the avatar that looks like a gladiator is an Idiot. We all know what the true Islam is and its something ignorants cant understand. FORCED MARRIAGE IS PROHIBITED. Just because you're a Muslim it doesnt mean your life is much different. Believing is good. All over Turkey there are modern Muslims. You can date! I agree with that girl that said for you to take sex out of dating because these w-h-o-r-e's nowadays think you have to HAVE to HAVE sex on the first date. This is NOT what keeps a man amused and if he is amused by sex , then he isnt a man , he is an animal.|`|JCdBSULraa	Well in Islam, it's my understanding that marriage is typically arranged and forced around age 12-14 to a much older uncle or cousin.   This isn't an option in America.  If your father cannot arrange a marriage for you, you will have to undergo a female circumcision to remove your sexual organs so that you do not tempt married men to commit adultery.   <br>  <br>  Please reconsider your conversion to Islam, Mohammad performed no miracles, there is no stamp of God on his "ministry", he was merely a military genius who conquered Mecca and abused God's name to create a religion out of the bliss of victory his soldiers were experiencing.|`|AA10928214	move to America|`|Um8G2ZS3aa	salam from grandpa<br>  ya_shami@yahoo.ca<br>  let me know if you are near mosque|`|EJWphb88aa	Don hunt for love... it will come to you at the right time... be a little patient.. :)|`|sauE94zVaa	Why did you convert if you want to date while it's not allowed in Islam? It doesn't make sense. Just to let you know, it's always an option to go back.<br>  I was born in an Islamic society, but I chose to abandon those backward beliefs and be satisfied with living my life as a "moral" person, who can date, party, work hard, be as good as a man, make love and live life to the fullest.<br>  <br>  If you want to hold on to your beliefs, and the dating thing is the only one bit that annoys you, then I don't know what to tell you.. I think it's not dating that isn't allowed, it's having any kind of physical relation ship outside marriage that's not allowed. I have Muslim friends that date and that have BF/GF only without getting physical; maybe you don't know the right kind of people.

Why did you convert to Islam anyway? I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I was just wondering. If you are really looking for love and dating is not an option in Islam, then you may have to un-convert yourself.|`|iFE8txb4aa	well no muslims jews and christians all beleive in abraham and worship the same god.  Um how long have you been a muslim and which country do u live? cause' im sure there is a way, have you studied the qu'ran?|`|4gC38fKsaa	stop being muslim, lol. why did you convert from catholiscism?

You are both adults.  It's not the age of the people that you were unhappy with, it was the people themselves, don't confuse the two.  Good for you for being happy.  I'm not a rainbow family, but love doesn't discriminate.  I'm a heterosexual married woman with children.|`|55kHefG1aa	well, if you feel confortable with her, then you are good.  the age doesn't really matter, .. im 20 and my gf is 25... everytime i dated a girl of my age i would feel unconfortable.... dont worry about the age... worry about how she treats you and makes you feel.<br>  if you are happy with her dont worry what people say.

If you ignore him, he'll probably send more emails for awhile, until he doesn't, or maybe he won't give up on whatever little game he's playing.  But you shouldn't respond.  You shouldn't, because he is giving you nothing, and that isn't going to change.

I can't find anything to give you credit for in this situation.<br>  <br>  You cheated, lied and will continue to lie. Now you're about to bring a child into the situation.

I'm not judging you, I'm telling you. You can try and justify that all day long, and cheating is cheating. You create your own problems in life, and you've just made a mess for yourself here. If I were you. I'd pick a man and be faithful to him. Start over and try to forgive yourself.|`|AA10684513	You can't have it both ways.  You either tell him and hurt him or you don't tell him and he will find out anyways because he will notice you are getting bigger.  You say not to judge because you are a kind woman well kind women don't sleep with ther husbands best friends.|`|IOXBuE58aa	A kind woman????<br>  <br>  Kind people dont treat thier spouses this way, and if you truely loved ur husband then u would not have cheated on him.  Therefore its safe to say u have feelings for him but love playing around on him and should tell him the truth so u both can move on and be happy with other people.|`|qXkTatLMaa	You are going to have to tell your husband.  Start with being honest now, and let him decide for himself what his next actions will be.  Either way, you risk losing him, so it is best that you come clean now.  I wish you the best.|`|a74b14a2df8f491b94ca062ec6bd8e23aa	I don't know what kind of an answer you're looking for here. I mean...in one sentence you say he will be devastated, and in another you say you love both men. I don't know what to say to help you.|`|PDwlIrtsaa	Ouch, your going to have to deal with your own karma. If you truly love someone then you would do anything in your power not to hurt them? What the hell have you been doing, I feel sorry for your baby.|`|AA11437235	you should of thought about the consquences before you wrote this Question! Its to late I think :) good luck!|`|MjSLQlIHaa	wow you shouldve kept your panties up!|`|5DJcir9saa	First of all...in no way are you a "kind woman".  You put your feelings before your husband AND your children!  So I would use the word selfish as opposed to kind.  Second...you are correct in thinking if you truly love someone than you'd do anything in your power not to hurt them.  But I don't think you were doing everything in your power while you were out sleeping with random men.  You are now just using that logic to justify your selfish behavior.  Your husband is a "good man" and is suffering from a disease that he cannot control and instead of supporting him and figuring out what you can do to help his sex drive, you go off and sleep with random men!  <br>  <br>  I know you asked us not to judge, but in your situation, that is all I can do.  All you can do is deal with this mess that you've made.  You need to fess up to your husband.  I personally think he should find a more deserving woman.  All you deserve is that bastard of a friend that decided to knock you up.|`|BObu4i9saa	you are not a kind woman - and it is impossible not to judge in this situation - it would have been nicer to him if you just left him - and if you're going to cheat that's bad enough, but with his best friend? that's not kind that's heartless<br>  <br>  he's got diabetes - he's not on his deathbed - he can still do 99% of what needs to be done in a relationship & there's options for ED - you obviously weren't trying to make your marriage work - you just have up<br>  <br>  tell your husband what's going on and see what he wants to do<br>  it's not your decision anymore - it's up to the man you betrayed<br>  <br>  you screwed up - grow a backbone and take responsibility for your actions|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	I don't believe you truly love your husband then, because you went out of your way to hurt him more than once, all because of your selfishness.<br>  I could see you being devastated the first time, but to go out and do it several times............give me a break, you could of bought a vibrator.|`|gLnCgMVJaa	Don't judge, your on yahoo asking a question then asking not to be judged....lol,  Time to grow up lady you have 3 other children to worry about then being horny and wanting sex all the time.

First of all you shouldn't have been doing this mess. Secondly,you should've been using protection,knowing that you were doing something that you wasn't suppose to be doing.Thirdly,you should've considered getting an abortion. Your husband was sick, so what gives you the audacity to go search for sex elsewhere?That's crazy. The two of you should've invested in some sex toys or something,or just pleased yourself. But the word KARMA is a reminder of all of this.|`|AA11761605	Basically you made a conscious choice that you will have to deal with no matter what the outcome is.  The most important thing now is the unborn child.  You were a terrible person to do this to your husband and if you made vows to God and disobeyed them you will have alot to deal with. You need to learn what love is really all about because apparently you slept your way through that too.|`|EXJEjSUWaa	you need to think about what your going to choose to do with the baby, and go from there. the thruth is the best way to go . and about hurting your husband thats too late whats done is done. come out with the truth to him after you decide what your going to do with the baby.you know him best , i'm sure you know what his reaction will be . its to late for regrets and i'm sorry. good luck and i hope your husbands finds a better person|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	My husband had a condition which left him unable to have sex for seven years. So I went without - because I believe that if you truly love someone then you will do everything in your power not to hurt them.<br>  <br>  You're a kind woman? Yes - but what kind of woman are you? I think we all know now.|`|OYD5QqBfaa	so what do you want me to answer? Of course you need to tell him. dont use the poor me husband has no sex drive bs, have you never heard of your fingers or sex toys????? you dont want to hurt him.... you already have! why not hammer the nail harder. He deserves an honest woman and a new "best friend" leave him- if you loved him you wouldnt be in love with his friend.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	Either way he will be hurt, if you love him you will come clean and tell him he really does deserve at least that from you. If he loves you there is a chance he will want to work it out. <br>  I'm sorry that you got yourself into this. Keep healthy for your baby and the best of luck!|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	Blue, you need to tell your husband and face whatever consequences you have to face.  Yes, he is a good man who deserve better behavior than what you are doing.  Oh, he will be hurt but it better coming from you than anyone else.  Good Luck!|`|fLU63N4kaa	"I believe if you truly love someone then you’d do anything in your power not to hurt them."<br>  <br>  Said the woman who screws her husband's friends! Hypocrisy I say!|`|776402222f313576ef25a004cfb3aed8aa	You have to tell both of them, NOW.

Clearly, he is going to know since you have been not having sex...duh! <br>  <br>  Are you keeping the baby? Is the father of the baby married? Do they have kids? You have a lot of decisions to make and NONE of them will be easy.<br>  <br>  Every step in our lives is a choice and you have made some grave choices! And I would hope you would do things a little differently if you had to do it over. Did you even consider your own childnren's feelings when you decided to commit adultery? I am not trying to judge you, but there is more than just you involved here. Don't you think you're children are going to be hurt by your actions?|`|AA11243157	First of all, your husband is going to be devastated no matter how you go about this. You say if you truly love someone you'd do anything not to hurt them. Then it is my belief that you (and I am not trying to be mean, just truthful) are not truly "in love" with your husband. You may love him like you would love a friend, or family member, but not romantically. If I were you, I would tell him about your affairs, at least the most recent one (no need to go into details) and you need to get a divorce. I'm sorry but even if you can get him forgive you, I don't see how anyone truly could, no matter how much he loves you. Even if you stayed together for another 10-20 yrs, it will only be years wasted, and you will eventually depart ways. (source for this is my grandparents. They stayed together for 15 yrs after she had an affair, only to end in divorce, she admits it was 15 yrs wasted) If you are not far along, I wouldn't tell him about the pregnancy if you decide to get a divorce. Don't spring everything on him at once. If you try to work things out(which, i'm sorry, but will probably be in vain) you will have to tell him, and tell him it's not his. It's not fair to him, the child, or the real father for that matter. It will eventually come out in the open, and the longer you wait, the worse it will hurt.<br>  <br>  But listen, if you were brought to this point, regardless of your husband's sex drive, then something in the relationship just wasnt working. Whether it be on your part or his. Maybe you should have been more understanding of his problems, but maybe he should have tried to do more to satisfy your needs as a woman. I know my grandmother was led to have an affair because her husband neglected her for 2 years. Maybe it wasnt sex that you needed, but companionship. Sex drive has nothing to do with giving someone companionship.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what you decide to do, feelings will be greatly hurt, no way around it. Best to just tell him tell him now, the more you wait, the worse it will hurt. Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|AA12234214	I'm not going to judge you on the dishonesty and the cheating, I truly understand what it is to be sex deprived when you are in a marriage that you are not satisfied in and it doesn't mean you don't love them. I suggest you tell your husband the truth that you have cheated on him and his best friend, I would recommend though keeping the whole 3 yrs affairs it would only hurt him more. But keep in mind that it is better to know and find out by your significant other than not knowing and finding out later that it was all a lie. Be honest with him tell him you made a mistake and that you hope he forgives you and if he doesn't well then give him time. Another thing I would suggest is USING PROTECTION now that I will judge you for because it's disgusting and not fair to your husband to contract a disease because you felt you needed to get off. Now if you DID use protection then remember that nothing in this world comes without consequences. I wish you the best of luck and hope that it all works out for the baby's sake, but please understand your husband and the position he's in if you are inkling for a freaking then masturbate, sometimes you just have to make some sacrifices especially if it isn't their fault.|`|a6222738fbe6f6b9d8120b6513eca88daa	Your asking people not to judge...<br>  <br>  <br>  but..<br>  <br>  <br>  I understand you have your biological needs, your husband is suffering from a disease. And I'm sure it bothers him more then you know, not to be able to have relations with his wife...not to mention just the day to day of the disease.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is one thing to go into the "city" to release your sexual frustration with random men that you don't care about(which is a moral question in itself) but his best friend? I mean come on...that is horrible judgement. You have done alot of damage at this point, and bringing another human being into this world, in this situation, is not kind.<br>  <br>  I'm not judging, but the way I see it, you need to tell the truth...bottom line. ESPECIALLY if you are going to keep the baby.
JyDIrXzeaa	hmmm, that's a hard one.. well, if the girl thinks she's in love and it overwhelms you, I would NOT go with her. If you're still very close with your ex g/f go with her. You'll be more comfortable and have a better time. It's all about who you are most comfortable with when it comes to a prom date. <br>  Trust me, i've been thru both extremes. Extremely cute guy i was interested in but didn't know too well was nowhere near as fun as the prom with my best guy-friend (we had a thing, but it wasn't a relationship). It's all about making the most of your night of fun. For you and your date.<br>  Explain to the in-love girl that you just feel more comfortable going w/ your really close friend and that you guys are only going as friends.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|dhTMwvDvaa	lol dump them both and take me? =D<br>  hahahaha just kidding.<br>  that is a tough choice.....there's no way for u to do both? at all?<br>  how about......i guess if u absolutely have to choose take the ex-girlfriend.......the other one scares me! tell her you're not feeling well....or no wait...........tell her that you're not allowed to go.<br>  <br>  actually, just scratch that. take whoever u like the best and be honest with the other one. but yea, if that isnt a good choice, then go with what i said at first.<br>  im sorry if im being confusing D=<br>  it's a hard choice.<br>  good luck tho! =D|`|fGs6DLoraa	That is scary. You pick whoever you want but baring in mind that the other girl may get offended that you haven't gone with her. See, I don't have this kind of trouble - I cause it. It's a girl thing!! lol. But probably you should go with your ex because you know each other better and she is more likely to get offended is you don't go with her. Good luck!|`|aUosbTqqaa	other girl... you may get some new meat.. if you're in that kind a stuff. And then decide who's better , her or your ex|`|kNCbstUTaa	the girl who thinks shes in love.<br>  there mustve been a reason you broke up with your ex.
zzUgYFy4aa	no it is not possible to ERASE the past and pretend it never happened<br>  <br>  you should take a break from the friendship and see what happens in the future
1TQTw2bnaa	They're trying to say "wait until you're older". My advice would be to ask your parents exactly what it would take for them to allow you to go to the mall with your friends - not just saying "be responsible". I think it would also help you if you went during the day on a weekend and outlined a plan of how they can reach you if they need to, where you'll be, who will be there, etc. Good luck! <3|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	12 is not teen so you are still young.<br>   All parents love their children and only want the best for them.<br>     They also fear that their child will be the one to be harmed by a stranger.<br>     Behave your self and when your friend are going ask if you can go with them and that you want mom or dad to take you and pick you up and when they allow it be sure that you are waiting where you are supposed to be|`|4xAOZXwNaa	Well some ways you can try talking you're parents into it is tell them that you're gonna be with a group of friends.. like trying going there with at least 3 or 4 and if you have a cellphone which I'm not sure if you do.. then you can always tell them that you will have you're phone with you at all times so they can contact you. Or maybe try finding a friend that is way older then you.. Like 16 or 17 and tell you're parents that someone way older then you is gonna be there to watch you and is gonna be keeping an eye on you. And just try acting like a responsible mature teenager and they should let you go in no time :).|`|ZVGbONH9aa	If you are a Christian, then remember that one of the 10 commandments is "Honor your mother and father."  Any further questions?  <br>  <br>  You're 12 years old for Gods sake.. what in the world are you doing out alone or hanging out at the mall?  Get involved in a church youth group and I'll bet your parents will trust in you more.  Which reminds me of an old saying that still applies today.  "Tell me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are."<br>  <br>  Blessings and don't be in such a hurry to be grown up.. enjoy your youth.|`|YAjmiDJraa	Talk to them but don't pry. Prying leads to upsetness lol. Just try to convince them and I would go for the softer parent first. And don't think you're the only kid in the world with protective parents. Act responsible lol. They'll notice..but on their on time.|`|KXOjenrcaa	You need to sit down and seriously talk with them. This happened to me too. I'm thirteen and I wasn't allowed to go to the movies alone with my friends. I sat my parents down and I told them how frustrated I was that they weren't listening to me. They gave me scenarios of what I would do and I gave them answers that they didn't even know I would think of. Tell them that you honestly think you're ready and you understand why you don't want them to. When I hear about my little brother wanting to go hang with his friends alone, it scares the daylights out of me just because I love him and I don't want anything bad to happen to him, so try to relate to them so you will understand each other better. You could also compromise with them. Like, they can be there, but not around you. Or in a different store or something. Cell phone's are a great way to have your parents check up on you without getting embarrassed.
vn2Lq7hIaa	He is definitely not bored with you if you're active two or three times a month. That's two less than the average in a seven year marriage.<br>  <br>  Is he on any medication that might causes drowsiness?

He's just not as naturally motivated as he used to be.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Just like with women, stress, fatigue, weight gain and a poor diet can affect our libido. Honestly, worrying about your self-esteem and your feelings if this is his problem does not help. But if possible he also should be taking steps to change his condition, like getting more sleep or improving his health.<br>  <br>  Women tend to be completely reactive instead of trying to solve their problems. So the next time you want sex perhaps you should take the initiative. Make all the moves and do what it takes to turn him on.|`|IOXBuE58aa	Well i would say start having sex earlier in the day, if u work meet him at home on ur lunch break rite after he gets home, seduce him, plan a trip without the kids or a date night.  If none of this works then be worried, i work from 5am to 5pm, i get home everyday and want sex but cant get it. Men should not be turning down sex, its not in our DNA.<br>  They do say men in thier 30's have lower sex drives but im 29 and still want it everyday so im not believing that theory.|`|PDwlIrtsaa	Ive had the same problem, but things seem to spicen up on their own, we go through stages, sometimes hot and heavy sometimes none at all, try giving him a bj more often maybe that will help?|`|AU3HVTToaa	yess|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	He might be just tired but to fall asleep while having sex is a possibility.  Try making love instead of having sex, making love takes a little more thought and effort.  Having the same type of sex can getting boring.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	If he fell asleep during sex, he's tired.

Try adjusting your schedule to be more accommodating to him.|`|XrtmT2kUaa	I have been married for 13 yrs now and we only have sex 3 or 4 times a month but he is tired too. Men have a hard time after awhile especially if they are working a lot. Trust me, he probably wants to but is truly too tired. Try to be patient with him. Also you can help things by doing all of the work when he does find the energy. He will also like the take charge attitude. What man doesn't like to just lay there and get pleasure from it. Good luck and it does get better.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	No he's not bored he is not stimulated. I do think you are bored with yourself. It has to be a challenge being mother and wife.  Where is the you in all this? I tip my hat to you because you are trying to juggle it all. And probably doing a good job at it. But you need something for yourself. Honey I been there and yet we are so blessed. i want you to try something.<br>  <br>  1. When husband is up and about, let him catch you putting on make up.  Do this for several reasons. One, to remember when this routine was important to you. Two, to make him think, what the hell are you doing. You will not be doing this to make him jealous but only to make him think that's all.<br>  <br>  2. Let him catch you exercising but not in your sweats. Try it in your good panties and bra or the sexy ones. You will feel a good something about yourself and he will wonder, who are you doing this for. It will remind him to get on his job. If the children have to be present when you do this, so be it!<br>  <br>  3. Put appreciation notes in his lunch, pocket or wallet. Give him something to think about while he's at work.<br>  <br>  4. Pinch his butt on his way out the door.<br>  <br>  5. Tell him when gets dressed for work he looks so God damn sexy   <br>      when he's dressed for work.<br>  <br>  6, Look in the mirror and find something that you like and keep it <br>      locked in your mind. You will exude that confidence all day. He'll <br>      notice trust me.<br>  <br>  Break the routine and things will be different. Good luck.|`|Bq51x58jaa	i wouldnt blame u for thinking he is bored of u like come on he actually fell asleep in the middle of sex but that also proves that he really is just wrecked tired. most couples sex life dwindles after a while but mostly its the woman that doesnt really want it that often. it does really sound like he is just tired tho. i wouldnt take it too personally just try and do something nice and unexpected for him some nite while the kids are out of the house and hopefully he will respond to that.|`|Z1UYtOQKaa	is it possible that he is interested in someone else|`|gB1dXEHCaa	$100 says he has a hot young gf that is wearing him out...that's what happened to me anyway
FQeSo65Haa	The problem is, who pays them? The husband? I'm sure men won't be too happy about that. The whole point of housewives is that they're free, no charge, supposedly do it out of their golden heart. A housewife demands money, people will call her selfish and hard-hearted. I agree with you that housewives have a very, very hard time. What they do is not easy . But you chose it. If you want money, divorce your hubby and go get a job.|`|mMBzpldbaa	no you shouldn't be paid. you chose to do a "job" you knew was unpaid. you get your food and board for free and that's more than i get. i'm a student and i have to work for food and board. quit complaining, who would pay you anyways?|`|ibeVcQyWaa	And just who's going to pay you?

You will need to get a divorce first.|`|1TQTw2bnaa	I really disagree with that. They aren't doing "non stopping work" that the rest of us aren't - just because we might outsource childcare or some housecleaning doesn't mean that our children are never cared for or that we never clean our own homes.<br>  <br>  Housewives/SAHMs also get "holiday". They get to sleep later than the rest of us, they get to do errands during the week, they get to go on family vacations (without having to secure the time via HR), and they do get paid by getting access to their husbands' income.|`|uGG69oJyaa	A House wife is a difficult job, no doubt. But unless your caring for children or an elderly parent or some similiar situation there is no reason to be strictly a house wife.  It is a choice because there is nothing stopping you from working to get a salary.(this is of course after your maturnity leave is over) <br>  <br>  Plenty of people are working Moms and Dads with children at day care.  And still manage to do the shopping, take care of the kids, make decisions, clean the house, do the laundry, get dinner ready. I know this because I am one of them, and my wife and I have little trouble gettng it all done and have plenty of time to ourselves.  We also rather enjoy those holidays you never seem to get. <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like your Husband is getting a free ride.  Yes it is tough on one salary, I do understand that, but Family allowance helps some. And it is a choice to be a housewife, not a sentence.|`|ZVGbONH9aa	If you expect to get paid for what you do, then you're not doing it out of a sense of duty or love.  Being a house wife is one of the most difficult jobs that can be done without pay.  The rewards go beyond money.  You can't put a price on showing your children a good example of what a good mother is truly worth.. You can't put a price tag on having a 2 parent family, which is almost unheard of.  If you feel unappreciated, then stop doing what you do for a few days and see what Hubby says.  I'm sure he will see the reality of your sacrifice.  My wife pulled this on me not to long ago.

50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	You have to divorce first, and to do that you have to meet with an attorney to find out how to go about serving by publication in your state.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	You probally need to contact your local court to find out what to do or they can help you find that person.  I know a divorce legally has to be done.|`|0tusTThyaa	You go to court and file for a divorce. If you cannot find her to serve her the papers. The courthouse will tell you acceptable ways to "notify" her. Such as a notice in a local newspaper. The filing fee for divorce will probably be around $250, give or take. Must be divorced prior to getting married again. Bigotry is a crime.|`|Hl8KNCLMaa	Follow Kari's advise. It may work differently from state to state. In georgia you have to run a notice in the local newspaper for about six weeks (I think), then you have shown reasonable effort to get in touch with the ex and a judge will grant the divorce.|`|776402222f313576ef25a004cfb3aed8aa	Get the opinion of an attny in your area|`|AA10204462	get a lawyer but since he won't be there to contest it, it shouldn't cost much
OFquJwUkaa	He's obviously using you, and knows how to make you come back to him. (knows your weakness.) I'd say leave him once and forever!
