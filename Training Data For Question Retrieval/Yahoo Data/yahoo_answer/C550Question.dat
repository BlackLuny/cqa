I was living in a very intense household where theres no privacy, and even when you leave the house my parents seemed to always know where I went. They consider extramarrital sex to be a big enough sin to kill me(literally) over. So I was scared to death to go to a doctor when I was a teen. I didnt want them to find out.       So my question is, do crabs go away on their own? Can they cause damage if left alone? I had crabs for a couple weeks, and tried using milk and OJ to treat it(I read that it works). They seemed to go away. Did I really clear up or did they just borrow down further or lay dormant or something.

20090307150930AAhWw6W	Health;Men's Health	Should I get a vasectomy?	My wife and I have been talking about whether or not we would ever want children and discussions have brought us to the conclusion that we will never want to have a child.  We've been together for a little over 4 years and married about 7 months and we've consistently voted against ever going down the baby path.      Since we've basically decided we don't want children I've brought up the idea of getting a vasectomy to my wife since it would guarantee no "oops" babies and we would save a ton of cash by not needing to buy condoms anymore.      The only thing that has kept me from getting a vasectomy is our ages.  I'm 25 and my wife is almost 23.   I understand that's a pretty young age for a vasectomy, but the two of us feel very strongly about our no baby policy.        Please, let me know what you think.        Just to save some people time:   1)  The pill is out since it causes problems for my wife   2)  Tube-tying is out since that is just dangerous   3)  Abstinence is out of the question

20090307153231AAnefYi	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	A few basics about my husband's high cholesterol?	My husband is only 30.  He is in excellent shape and is a health food junkie.  His cholesterol is pretty high and the doctor put him on medication.  He took it for a year and it lowered.  Then he went off of the medication and ate only perfect food for a few months, went back and his levels were through the roof.  Therefore, it's the genetic type of high cholesterol.  He is back on medication now.  I have a few basic questions to help me understand his risks:      1.  He also has high "good" cholesterol.  Does this, in any way, "cancel out" any of the "bad" cholesterol?   2. Since he is on medication, as long as he remains on medication and his levels are normal while on the meds, does that mean he's not at risk?     3.  Since he's only 30, is it going to be dangerous for him to be on these medications for so many more years?  (simvastatin).    4.  Is there anything (besides Cheerios and oat meal) he can supplement with or eat to help keep things under control?        Thanks   A concerned wife!

20070611002153AASs74a	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Is A & D: First Aid Ointment okay for tattoos?	I got a tattoo Saturday, the 8th, as a birthday present. It turned out great & it's one I've always wanted but at the place I got it done said just use A & D ointment. Well, at the store there was A & D that was supposed to be for diaper rash & then A & D: First Aid that seemed better for scars & such. I figured a tattoo is kinda like a scar in a way? So I got that but a friend said that the first aid type might speed the healing and mess it up or something? I'm not sure if that makes sense but he has one already so now I'm really nervous.  Anyone know?

20090227074640AAHg8G2	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Can deodorant cause breast cancer?	I have very sensitive skin and I cannot use a lot of deodorant brands because they cause me to have allergic reactions.      I'm not sure what chemicals are in deodorants but I'm pretty sure that they are very harmful by the way that they make me feel.      However I started using lady speed stick some years ago and I started to notice that when my armpits would touch my breasts I would feel pain.      When the deodorant touched my breasts they started to feel unusually tender and I was feeling pain.      I started to wonder if deodorant could potentially be the cause of breast cancer.      Any comments?

20090307095711AAKUffZ	Health;Other - Health	When is this chest pain normal, and when should i see a doctor?	For the last week, i have been having random chest pain, on my left side. In the same area as my heart. I just assume it is heart burn, although i have never had a problem with heartburn before. My diet hasnt changed, etc.       The pain comes and goes, maybe lasting a few seconds at a time. But when it comes, it literally stops me in my tracks. I can feel it, like there is something clogges in there - that type of feeling. And my heart will occasionally skip a beat, which that has never happened before either.      Last week, i had a dizzy spell with this. I just assumed i needed to eat.      So this has been going on about a week now, should i just go see a doctor, or is this just heart burn? I dont want to make a big deal out of nothing, but i dont want to ignore something that could be importnant.      Thanks

It's not really terrible pain but it's just annoying. If i press down under my ribs it almost is like it's relieving pressure.

So they looked at the area too and they said nothing was wrong. What should I do? I'm just sick of going to the Dr.

My uncle has been diagnosed with pneumonia...?	...they initially thought it was TB, however when the tests came back negative they decided it was pneumonia instead.  But, when they assumed it was TB, he was put in isolation, yet, they still haven't taken him out and no one apart from my aunt can go in, and even then she has to scrub up and put on the gown and mask.  Is there something they aren't telling us?  Because i didnt think this was the usual thing to do when one has pneumonia, its not exactly contagious is it?

So by Monday I was really sick. Congestion in the nose. Dry cough with very unproductive coughs. Just felt like crap. So I went to the doctor and she said I just have the cold. She ordered me a chest x ray for me and that came out fine. She gave me an antibiotic. I still had this wicked dry cough and it hurts. I can still hear stuff moving around in my lungs. So I went back to the doctor who made me take a breathing test. She gave me prednozone and albuterol and some cough medicine. The cough seems a little bit more productive but is still somewhat dry. I woke up this morning and coughed and there was blood in it. This happened for three coughs. I don't know if it is the irritation from coughing so much or something else. But now I'm just coughing up more somewhat productive dry coughs with no blood. I have another doctors appointment on Monday and this is scaring me. Help. =(

Hello, for the past 2 years I think...My calves feel tired ALL the time..even when I am not working out. They are not sore and they do not hurt...they just feel heavy and tired its hard to explain.      I play soccer and on some of my off days I run or work out. I wear gel inserts that cover the bottom of my foot, but only the heel area becasue it helps with my anlkes and shin splints. But I really don't know whats wrong...is it some type of growing pain? (I'm 17. 6'1 about 175). I am pretty active and not over weight...is it something missing in my diet? I really need help because I don't think it affects how fast I run really but it makes me really lazy i think...should I go to my doctor? all help is appreciated!

I was hospitalized because my lymph nodes got so big it stopped my breathing. Then about 2 months later i go back to school for 1 day and i caught phenomena. So know i have been throwing up for 2 weeks. Nothing has worked for nausea. I have been to hospital 6 times to get me rehydrated and i got a cat scan and all my lymph nodes in my lower belly were swollen. I have been getting way weaker than i was. My balance is way off, vision is a lot worse, had a migraine for a month. It burns really bad when i pee and i have been tested for UTI, STD, and kidney stones all came back negative so that just baffled them. I have been getting real bad pains right above my groin to were i cant even bend there cause it hurts so bad. My one doctor says it is all mono that is it. My bowel habits have changed as well. I decided to get a second opinion at a gasterologist and they are doing a colonoscopy, and the mouth one with a biopsy i don't really know what for though. My nausea has been so bad they made me go to a compound pharmacy to get this cream i put on my arm and it really don't work. I have been very miserable.      So does mono get worse and are all these symptoms of mono?      Im sick of being really sick. Also i been sweating like a pig even when it is very cold

I am 6 months pregnant, and around 8:30 I had plain oatmeal with craisins, banana's and brown sugar in it.  Around 3PM that same day, I had a sudden urge to "go" so I went to the bathroom, and there were a couple of craisins in my "leavings".       Anyway, I haven't had craisins in months (if not years) so I know it had to have been from that morning...is that normal?  How fast should food move through your digestive tract?  Could something be wrong?  I thought food typically takes 24 - 48 hours to clear out of your system.

On and off for the past few days, I've been getting really sick to my stomach and throwing up.  Lately, after I have a meal, I get really nausea and struggle to keep food down.  The good news is that I've kept some food down.  Tuesday, I dry heaved and puked three times, then threw up again Thursday and yesterday.  I thought I was pregnant at first but I don't think that's the case in my situation:   --I've been on the birthcontrol pill for almost three months, and always remember to take it, never missed a pill including the sugar pills   --My boyfriend also uses a condom correctly at all time and pulls out on time right before he ejac's with the condom still on; no leakage when we checked.   --Over the past month, I still got a light period and I've taken four home pregnant tests and all came out negative; so far so good.   So, I don't know what the hell is going on with my body.  However, I have been very stressed out about some stupid sh*t lately and my boyfriend and I have been having alot of arguments, over nonsense.  There's also some tension going on with me and my mom.  I've been hyperventilating and had two sleepless nights this week.  I don't feel like I'm running a fever and have no body aches.  So, I wonder if it's because I finally stressed myself to the point of being physically sick?  Hopefully that's the case, and that I need to chill the f**k out?  I seriously have it really good in my life, yet I still act like a lunatic?

I don't even know who I am nor passionate about anything. I just feel like I'm kind of drifting along.

I would say I'm an extremely philosophical person, kind of interested in nihilism, because I don't really believe life has meaning. But part of me wants to find my own meaning and truth.

20090307152336AA2XEjK	Health;Diet & Fitness	Fitting into a dress?	Today I bought an adorable second hand dress (that I totally don't need, and have nowhere to wear it, but it was only $5) and it does fit and zip up all the way... just.  See, the dress is a size 3/4, which is fine for my figure, but my breast size is rather... unnatural (but natural!) for my size.  (We're talking 32DD.)  So it makes me look a bit squished up there.      The problem is, I don't really need to lose weight.  I don't overeat and I'm normally fairly healthy, and I'm definitely not lazy since I'm on my feet all day for work.  I was wondering if anyone knew any ways just to lose that little bit- 2 to 4 pounds- especially around that area.        I've asked many people about this before, and am always told that the only way is to overall lose weight, so I've finally decided maybe I should try to shave a few pounds off, it definitely wouldn't kill me :)  But if you've had any luck with specific exercises for that area, I'd appreciate it.      Thank you!

Also numerous biscuits and looads of chocolate.      I usually put on around 5lbs during my period (bloating too) but I lose it after. So is this okay?      Thanks

Ok so I tried to give blood today, but the lady didn't stick me right - I mean, it just hurt like a mofo and would not stop hurting!  I regularly give blood and I KNOW she stuck me wrong because my blood usually flows just fine and it's never hurt that much before.  Then, she didn't even tape the tube down and she kept moving the needle around and it f***ing HURT.  It still hurts.  She said it was flowing too slow - I think that and why it was so painful was because she didn't hit the vein right.  I told her that but she just kept making it worse.  I know I'll have to ice it and everything, but:      My question is:  what's the worst possible thing that could happen from a bad needle stick?

I haven't really exercised for a couple weeks (about 2-3 weeks) until Thursday when I started softball at my school. We didn't run or anything. We just did throwing and catching and ground balls, but the thing was that we didn't stretch our legs out before so I think that probably had some effect. After practice though, my hamstring/groin area started to hurt and when I walked I was limping quite a bit. It still hurts when I walk and when I try to stretch it out. I was thinking that possibly I pulled a muscle or something but I'm not sure.      so if you know, please let me know what I can do to help it heal faster b/c we have practice next week and then on Saturday I'm going to costa rica for a school trip and we'll be doing a lot of walking. so please let me know asap!      thanx a ton. best answer gets 10 points

20090307151450AA5Iyvo	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Strep throat and swallowing pain?	I went to the doctor today and learned I have strep throat.       I dosn't hurt unless I cough, spit or sneeze and slightley when I talk. But the major promble is when I swallow, it feels like I have servel nails, toothpicks and jaged rocks in my throat and I have to deal with them scraping my throat.      I am currently on two different medicines. One kills the pain and one kills the desiese. The one that kills the desiese is doctor suscribed and does not kill the pain at all. The pain killer is not doctor subsrcibed and is vise versa, killing the pain but doing nothing about the actual desiese. The ironic thing about these pills is they are swallow pills. =\      If I do not take my doctor subcribed medicine I could get kindey deisese or some fever that can kill me, I do not know the name. If I do not take my pain killer I am in a crying wreck, which just hurts my throat.      It has gotten to the point where I can not eat or drink, and I relize this is very unhealthy for my body and will give the strep throat an advantage in this horrible battle over my body.       I have tried ice cream, ( which was too dense for me to swallow without pain) apple sauce, (which was too liquidy my throat still hurt) and other similer foods such as yogurt. Every thing didn't help. I can barley get the apple sauce down with my pain killer.      When my mouth is filled with saliva, I must swallow, causing mass amounts of pain. It hurts a little less when I simply spit it out, but this is a huge inconvience to me considering I have a large amount of energy lose. When I am laying down it takes me all my might to stand up, let alone walk around.      I do not drink any alchol or smoke. I'm only 14 and I follow the rules, so...      I have given you as much imformation has possible, and now I will get to the real question, which is an odd one I must warn you. How do I reduce the obligation to swallow? I think it may be like blinking, if you think about it-you do it. If you have read this whole thing so far and you are planning to finish reading to the end please put a star right before you answer me, too make a star try shift+8. If this does not work just type out the word, "star". Like when I am napping (which is quite often) and can't find the energy to get up how do I prevent my self of swallowing?       Also, what kinds of foods and drinks might be good for my throat? I need something not as dense as ice cream, but not as thin as apple sauce. Also, the food product must be convient to get. I live quite close to a CVS, a diary mart and a Kroger.      P.S-sorry for all the misspelled words, my spell checker won't activate...

Initially, I thought it was just a fluke or because I was drunk or something (it had never happened before), but twice seems like a pattern to me.      Would it be tough to get some Viagra (or Cialis, or whatever) from a GP? I'm currently at school, and don't have a regular physician out here. Would it be tougher to ask for (or, more accurately, to GET) this at an initial appointment?      They want to try again next weekend, and I'm already freaking out about it! I need help!      I'm 22 years old, if it matters.
20090307145506AAHycKF	Health;Men's Health	Weak erections. Why?!?	I'm a 21 year old male. I masturbate (At most) 3 times a week.. usually once every three days or so. I'm more or less sure most guys my age do it nearly every day, so I know I'm not over-doing it.      Sadly, though, I haven't had a morning erection in years, nor have I had a rock-hard erection. I'm not overweight by much.. I could *maybe* stand to lose 10 lbs, but certainly not heavy/obese in the slightest.      I'm not overly stressed in my life and when I was younger (middle school - early high school) I had rock-hard erections and an erection nearly every morning. I just don't get what changed?!

20090307145317AAuNGye	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	How can I reduce the risk of transmitting Herpes?	I was diagnosed with Herpes. I asked my doctor for Herpes medication, but he didn't give me any. He said to come back when I have an outbreak, which I don't think I have gotten any since the initial infection.      Are Herpes meds only for when you are breaking out? Or is my HMO doctor being cheap? I am sexually active and want to be very careful about spreading it, I don't want to infect anyone. My doctor didn't provide me with much information about how to reduce chances of infecting others, except for use a condom. But can I kiss without worrying about spreading it?  This is especially important for me, if I decided to marry someday. How can I live with someone and be intimate without infecting them? Would taking meds reduce the chances of spreading it? Is there a website that can help educate me about actually LIVING with herpes?

20090307152553AA65DAq	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Been ill for 2 weeks now... symptoms?	It all started about 2 weeks ago. I got an excruciating sore throat which lasted for about a week; that came with loss of appetite, sickness, headaches and flu symptoms like blocked nose and congestion, very disturbed sleep (waking up and hallucinating) and a complete loss of appetite and chronic fatigue.   The throat pain eased off after a week (but it has by no means stopped. it's still swollen and quite sore) and i began feeling better (because i wasnt doing anything, just resting all day).    What I'm really concerned about, now, (2 weeks since the excruciating throat pain) is that it seems my glands (especially my left one, which i can't even move my neck properly for) has completely swollen up and is very very painful and the flu symptoms are not subsiding.    I felt awful today and don't have any energy or appetite again... my fear is that, although i felt better for a short while, i seem to be deteriorating again.    Have been to the doctors 3 times and they said there is no sign of tonsillitis which is good.   So just a brief run down of symptoms; Very sore throat (2 weeks) flu symptoms [severe congestion, headaches, aches and pains, sickness] (2 weeks), chronic tiredness, sickness, nausea and extremely swollen, painful glands (especially on left). anybody have any idea what virus could be causing this?

20090307155347AASyvbm	Health;Women's Health	First month on Yaz birth control; started my period two days later than I should have?	I take the pink active pills everyday, and I'm supposed to start my period on the days when I take the white inactive pills. Right? Well I was supposed to start my period on Wednesday, the 4th, but didn't start until today, (Saturday, the 7th).       Do I wait until I'm off my period again to start taking the pink active pills again, or should I start taking them today?       I'm sorry if the question confuses you. It's confusing me a bit just writing it. But please try to help!      Thanks a lot. :)
20090307155538AAkuf4V	Health;Dental	UNBEARABLE wisdom teeth pain!?	I just had oral surgery on my wisdom teeth on wed. I have stitches for my wisdom teeth. It's saturday now and the pain is extremely painful, worse then after the first two days which is said to be the worst. I had all 4 wisdom teeth out at the hospital, he said two were impacted, and he had to go into my jaw bone. My cheeks are swollen, red and hot. I'm wondering what if it's infection or what, it's just horrible.       I'm going to the ER tonight to get it looked at, but as of right now, I'm in unbelievable pain. If I stand up, or move alittle quickly there's a TON of pressure in my incision area's, if that makes sense. Does anyone know what's happening?
