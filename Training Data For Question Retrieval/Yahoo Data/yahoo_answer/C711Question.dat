20061105231551AAfMcos	Family & Relationships;Friends	Too busy for friends and I feel guilty? Anyone else feel this way?	I'm super super busy with life. I have a lot on plate with school and work, and I've been studying really hard to try and transfer into a top university, like Stanford or one of the Ivies. I feel like I just don't have time for friends right now. It's not going to be this way forever, though--it's just not the right time for me at this moment.      Here's exactly where the problem lies: My friends don't understand my goals. They tease me about what I'm doing and make me feel bad about it. I try to explain to them that I'm just busy at the moment and it's not the right time to hang out, but they don't seem to understand. Sometimes I feel really distracted from my schoolwork, because I find myself worrying about them. I've had friends who've left me because I couldn't hang out with them enough.       I feel like I'm alone on this situation. Is there anyone else out there who's in the same boat as me? Any advice?

20070602051609AAZK5DU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In New York divorces, do child support agreements typically include an annual cost-of-living increase?	In divorces in the state of NY, child support for a couple with two children is set at 25% of the annual salary of both parents, with each parent paying a portion of that 25% determined by the ratios of their respective incomes.  What I want to know is this:  is this amount normally set once and for all as a fixed dollar amount at the time of the divorce, or do divorce decrees normally include a cost-of-living increase (say increasing the child support each year, depending on increases of the incomes of each spouse)?  (And, yes, I know I should really ask a lawyer.)  Thanks in advance!

I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years 5 months and he still won't tell me he loves me.  I don't bug him about it at all I just bring it up every great once in a while and usually when I do we get in an arguement so I just don't bring it up anymore but I still think about it a lot.  I tell him I love him all the time but when I ask him if he loves me he says that he cares about me.  I just want everyone's opinion on if this is probably a major problem or I should just let it go.

20070729180457AADafN0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell a girl....to go dutch? please help!?	I have been dating this girl for nearly 7 months.   There is something i really like about her but i just can't tell what it is. Initially i thought it was her physique, but dropped the idea since i am still liking her for 7 months.      However there is one thing which she does that turns me off totally. She never offers to pay for anything at all. For instance when we watch movies/ have meals together, i always foot the bill FIRST and at the end of the day she never ever even offers pays back at all.      We are not even in a relationship yet and i feel that we should really go dutch but i just don't know how to put it across to her. At times i feel i am being used. What should i do?      Also, please advice on how to put it across to her in the nicest way possible that i feel we should go dutch? ( note: i like her and i don't want to ruin my chances  but i still want to let her know i feel dutch is the best approach)      Thanks for your time and help

20070729190024AA5xWjK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My wife left me, and I think I will never meet anyone as good as her again?	My wife was the woman I always looked for. She had perfect morals, was extremely family oriented ( this is one reason we had to split, because she missed her family in Germany so much), she was beautiful (looked like Christina Ricci), and i felt so good around her.   She asked me for a divorce unexpectingly- I thought life was good, and we'd be together forever.   I personally do not know ANYONE else that has all the qualities she had. Out of interest I have "checked out" some of the dating pages, and it seems the majority of the women do not take care of themselves physically, or have children. I love kids, and I want MY OWN someday, but i feel relationships that start where there is already children involved lack some of the intimacy being totally single would have. Either that or the women have slept with a ton of guys- I could not spend my life with someone that had that character flaw.   How do I follow her up, I think i lost the love of my life.

I am a soldier deployed away from home and my fiancee is always telling me that she is hurting because I'm gone. She makes it sound like it's my fault that she feels bad. I try to do everything in my power to make her happy but it never seems to work! She always makes it seem like I don't do enough for her. Then instead of telling me what she wants me to do, she tells me "it should come naturally to you" What the hell does that mean? It's like she wants me to be psychic! And if I don't do what she wants (even if I don't know) We spend hours fighting about it. I'm really at my wits end with her. I'm not exactly peachy keen over here but I deal with it. Why can't she? I talk to her as much as I can and it never seems to be enough. And it seems I'm not allowed to have a bad day either. I have even thought about letting her go. I love her very much but this is tearing me apart! Someone please help!!!

20070627233402AAmXgLP	Family & Relationships;Friends	She is a biter/copier.?	M is my best friend ever. But she is a biter. She always says she hates people who copy her or who are biters but she is one herself. For example I really like the books Twilight and New moon by Stephenie meyer and she said she wanted to read them so i let her borrow them. Now she is so obsessed about them and Edward (character in books). She even named her guitar Edward. Me and her were always on like the same page about everything because there is another girl in the group,B who bites everything but i dont really care and M. would always say if one person in the group likes something then the others shouldn't bite but she is biting. So she is also a hipocrite. When she told what she named her guitar i said that she is turning into B. and all she talks about is Twilight and she said its because there is nothing else to talk about ( because there isn't. She is like calling me twice a day). Well then she said she had to go and i hung up. i don't know what to do? is she really biting?

20070703205118AAUTNty	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I in love?	Okay..... let's cut to the chase.... when I'm around her I feel happy and warm and I feel like everything is okay, and it's hard to describe but it feels so good just to be near her. But we're friends  and she probably doesn't like girls, but she's always so nice and honest to me even when we're just playing around, and she tells me I'm beautiful and seems so much like she means it, and I feel so lonely when I think about her and I know that I can't tell her. I don't know what to say. I tell her I love her and she says she loves me but it's just in a friend way. She jokes about calling me 'her love' but maybe its a hint? I just feel so lonely because she makes me feel happier than anyone or anything ever has. But I'm still young, so maybe it's hormones or maybe I'm just pathetic and lonely, but I don't know what to do. Does anyone believe me? Should I tell her? ...I feel like a loser for asking this... No flames.

I have been dating this guy who's been running after me like crazy.

I told him, well I am scared of waking up oneday missing you! I just don't want to be hurt. I told him that he has no idea how much I missed him the other night when I couldnt see him. After he heard that, and it was the first time I was honest with regarding my feelings, I felt that he got freaked out and wanted to leave telling me that we only should be friends! He asked to come online to talk to him but I dont know what to tell him, any smart answers?

Ok so there is this girl.....she lives like over 500 miles away....well i met her online..myspace...we talked on there..then msn...and the phone...we can talk for literally like 6 or 7 hours at a time..and never get bored..i've been talking to her for like a year plus.... we think like exactly alike no lie...We seem perfect for each other....but she has a boyfriend that she has been with for almost 3 years now......and i think she is just setteling for him...b/c i kinda know who he is...and they dont really even match...and i prolly talk to her way more then he does...and i feel like an *** hole for even considering me trying to break them up..but if there is such thing as soul mates...we match...i know we do...im not interested in any other girls around here where i live...she is really the only one i wanna be with...      is it possible for me to be in love with her?   and do girls sometimes just settle for guys...cause they dont wanna leave their comfort zone or whatever?      and plus 500 miles aint nothing but a 2 hour plane ride tops.....
20070805225007AAgTTA2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she interested in me or not? :-s?	Ive known this girl for over a year now & I'm starting to like her a lot more now days. She recently broke up with her b/f & is single. Right now I'm trying to confide her, be there for her & suggesting that she can do better & have fun being single. However, n most cases deep down inside, I want her being with me obviously. The strange twists & turns I have been through with her is quite perplexing. In the past yr, even though she had a b/f who she says, loves dearly "rolls eyes". She still asked me questions like, wut should I wear today or tomorrow or actually come out & said, lets meet up for dinner @8pm & we do talk a lot to one another aswell. I can tell in the past yr she has tried to make me jealous with her stupid insecure b/f she seems to like so much, but does she truly love him & would she go back with him if hes not being boyfriend material in her eyes? Downer 2 this story is, I'm leaving for the summer, I asked her, wen I get back can meet up, she said maybe..good or bad?
20070805231501AAFJ6to	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when you think your best friend is lying?	I know for a fact my friend lies about cutting herself and having an eating disorder.  I know because I have one or two of those problems and I know what happens and everything about it.  She made up a whole other life and tells everyone, she's an only child, so she has no siblings unlike me who can rat you out if you lie.  So what do I do?  do I confront her or let her be?  But then you have to factor in...that I may be in love with my friend.  I don't want to lose her.  We tell eachother everything, well, not counting the lies.         On a side note, she has seen my cuts and and says that she has cut herself.  I know exactly how long it takes for them to close or go away and she doesn't have a single scratch.  When I'm pretty sure she knew I knew, she said she started cutting in other places, such as her lower stomach below her panty line, her inner thigh, all places where I could not check.      It really upsets me because shes lying about something that is very real to me. Please help.

20070807233713AAUfTZZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My bestfriend wants to date my little sister, what do I do, how would you feel?	My little sister just turned 18, now that she's legal, my bestfriend (who's also my roommate) wants to go out with her. I feel he's not right for her cus he only wants girls for 1 thing and it's the girl who ends up getting hurt by him. He says he's been liking my sis for a long time but he says stuff like "Your sister is hot" or "I'd tap that". I'm not sure if he's really going to be serious with her. I guess my sister likes him too cus she said "What happens if your letting me miss out on what could have been the best thing to happen to me" They both asked me for permission and my thoughts about it, but I've been trying to ignore it. I want to protect her by saying no, but what happens if I prevented a good thing from happening? I know if they breakup things will get awkward between all 3 of us, and I'll be stuck in the middle as usual.       Does anybody have some useful advise?

20090225151849AALqwvs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a guy makes attempts to talk to you would you think he likes you?	This guy is in one of my classes. I have never talked to him before this, but one time we were crossing the street one morning and he made convo until we had to split ways. Then this morning I was sitting in the cafe before class and he sat down beside me and made convo for a few mins then he left. would you think he likes me since he goes out of his way to talk to me?
20090225151910AAUR7Iy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if your fiance gave you an std?	And you are positive it wasn't from cheating, but from being a carrier of it before you got back together (were broken up for almost a year then rekindled your relationship, but during that time had multiple partners).       Would you work things out or say see ya?
20090225152038AAyCMHI	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend having sex?	I have a friend who is going out with this chick who is crazy obsessive over him. Meaning that she literally wants to have his kids even though they have been dating for less than a month. Now I personally don't think that my friend really even likes her because before they were dating, he would talk about how annoying she was to him because she already claimed that she was in love with him. But then the next day he asked her out. The whole time they are together, I always see him texting on his phone and she is just following him like a lost puppy. Then my friend gives me her letters to read and its usually really gross because she's talking about how she's going to pour chocolate syrup all over herself for him to lick and share sushi in they're mouths. He makes fun of them so that's why I don't think he really likes her to much.       Now I have no problem with them dating but recently I found out that she is ready to have sex with him. I told him that it wouldn't be a good idea because she is crazy obsessive and was talking about wanting kids with him. Also she will probably think that he is in love with her, which I'm very doubtful. In the end it will just make her even more attached to him. He just didn't understand because I had sex and here I am telling him not to have sex. But in this situation I think its different because shes a virgin who is already obsessive over him and will more likely get more attached.       I have no issues with people having sex in high school because I myself have had sex. But I'm worried that in this situation it wouldn't be a great idea because I'm thinking that she is going to try to get babies from him. Or just get even more obsessive over him.       Should I do anything?
20090225151906AActapW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married people: Can you answer my inheritance question please?	Okay, if you had more than one adult children, and one of them died before you, would you give their inheritance to their kids or would you split it amongst your living children?  The reason I am asking is that my uncle died a few years ago, and my grandparents changed their will to give his percentage to his children.  A couple of my aunts/uncles think this is a bad idea, so it got me to thinking whether this is a normal sort of inheritance decision or if it is unusual.      I will also add that I would rather they spend and enjoy every penny on their quality of life while they are alive and screw leaving anyone anything.  I also understand that they can do whatever they want with their money.  I am simply wondering what you would do if you were in the same situation.  I only have one child and no grandchildren, so I can hardly relate to their mindset.  Thanks in advance for your answers!

20090225152256AAH2hsH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Easy 10 points! (: Help meh? D:?	Soooo, three days ago, i told a guy that I liked him. And he told me that he liked me back. Then the enxt, day, we were talking and he asked me out. But this was all on AIM [instant messenger thingy]. And yes, he goes to my school, he's in my grade. Not in my class though. Anddd. So, he tells me that he doesn't want everyone to know. Because he thinks that he will have to go through teasing. [I'm in middle school, so everyone tends to be a bit overly dramatic.] And soo, at school, we just pretend to be 'normal'. But he usually doesn't talk to me. He claims he tries to sit at my table at lunch, but I guess he isn't. And, at the end of the day, I told him I loved him. He nodded and said, "Cool." Then I went home and got on AIM, and asked him why he was avoiding me. He said he didn't know and that he was sorry. Then he said he just doesn't want anyone to know about 'us'. Does he really love me? Or is there another thing going on? Easy 10 points !
20090225152853AA0zY40	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my roommate being ridiculous?	She's not the best dater, she picks crappy guys all the time, so me and my other roommate have just stopped saying things b/c it's none of our business. So she went downstairs in our dorm and sent us as text saying "hey my ex is coming up, try to be civil". why couldn't she just tell us when she was sitting with us in the living room like a minute before? we all agreed months ago that we're not going to say anything to each other b/c it's none of our business. it's ridiculous, every time she goes off to do something she thinks is wrong she texts us about it even if we say her a minute before. we don't care what she does with her life, but why would she text us when she went downstairs to let him in to come and bring him up instead of tell us? she complains about how her mom texts her about important things instead of just telling her but she does that exact same thing!
20090225153222AAWlf72	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I deal with my roommate?	I still have to live with her until the end of April. I never did anything to her but yet she still hates me. I work two jobs and school so i'm never home and never interact with her and yet she goes and tries to talk crap about me to the other girls on my floor and my other roommates. (which they told me about) On top of that she keeps using my internet cable when i'm not home and it's starting to break so i took it and hid it in my drawer today when i left home, she took and is using all of my sticky notes and keeps leaving a mess all over the house like she had flowers and leaves are ALL over our room. She got butt hurt b/c I told her it was her turn to take out the trash for the first time since august and she never washes her dishes(our other roommate does it) What is her problem? She hates me so much but she's going to use my things?

20090225152924AAvyLM2	Family & Relationships;Family	Difficulty getting on with my sister?	I find her difficult to deal with because she's often selfish and inconsiderate and has little respect for other family members. My main problem is that I dread occasions involving the family getting together like Christmas or when people come and stay at mine (she lives nearby but doesnt invite anyone to hers but comes round to mine whenever she wants, when there's anything going on she wants to be a part of). What tends to happen is that I get wound up but dont confront her because I dont want to make other people uncomfortable I just get stressed instead and less sociable. Any advice or experience in dealing with this type of situation would be appreciated. Thank you

20090225152536AAq7lD9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I play hard to get with girls?	Should I? I heard that even though you are interested in the other person, you don't make the first move, just be straightforward.      It also shows if she really likes you?      I think it also adds mystery as it makes it difficult to figure out you and keep her guessing so that she doesn't get bored quickily.      I recently just started Uni and I think there are some girls that like me.      What should I do about girls I hate / don't like? Play super hard and ignore but still be nice?

I have been dating my boyfriend for about 5 months now, and ever since we met, the mother to his daughter has been harassing me, whether it be directly, or indirectly.  There are a few pictures of my boyfriend with his daughter and two of me with his daughter on my PRIVATE Myspace page.  She found someone who knows me, and looked at my page.  I do nothing to provoke this woman, and I don't appreciate her constantly texting him telling him to tell me that she's going to punch me in the face.  I spoke with a police officer, and he told me to file a complaint for harassment, and if it continues, to press charges.  She is always calling me out of my name, and claiming I work at a strip club and blah blah.  But the thing that gets on my nerves is that she is threatening to come to where I live and hit me.  I'm persuing a career as a police officer, and I am not going to sit here and fight with this woman when the fight has nothing to do with me.  I have not retaliated against her because I feel as though this whole situation is pointless.      What do you guys think I should do?

20090225152850AAjOOTE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why did my boyfriend cry?	when i told my boyfriend that i might break up with him and would cut all contacts with him thereafter, he cried really hard. his ex had cheated on him before their 3 yr relationship ended. im his second gf and we have been together for 3 yrs and 4 months now. i've never seen him cry in these 3 years, was he just acting or did his crying really mean something? he was hugging me and rocking a little while he cried his eyes out. the strange thing is he was okay when i said we should break up but then teared up when i said that i will cut all communications with him afterward. he said even if we do break up one day, he still wants to be friends. i told him that was impossible, and then he started to cry. strange, no?

Now i am totally embarrassed and cant act right around her.

Then I got her a christmas present and she thought it was great and I thought it was going good until she revealed that she liked this sophomore guy and now i feel devastated. She invited me on a picnic but all she wanted us to do was stalk him. Now i want to get her a valentines day present but i don't know what to get or if she'll accept it.  What should I do!? I feel like I need to get her something.
20090121183201AAaV1hc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give this guy a chance?	There's this guy in the year below me who keeps protesting over IM chat (if that isn't bad enough) that he'd like to meet up with me out of school alone.    He is very loud and outgoing, drinks at the weekend and there's rumours of him treating girls like crap. Basically.      I don't assume things about people just by listening to others judgements, so I was going to give him a chance.   Our chats on IM are kind of deep and I like that there's a different side to him conversing, other than the macho, horrid kind I notice in school.      But here's the thing: he wants to meet me OUTSIDE of school, and I've not to tell anyone I met him. Sounds promising, huh? Not.   He's "popular" in school and I'm not. I'm a bit of a nerd. I suppose the reason is because he is shallow and does not want any of his friends to know he'd ever be interested in me.      So, basically...I'm offended at that and think it's kind of stupid. I'm not meeting him "secretly" just for his pleasure.       Is that really silly of me? Am I taking offensive for nothing?   I was going to tell him straight that it's a no, but I thought I'd seek advice first.
20090128140156AAIlrqm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP FAST!!! I told him i like him. Does he like me back?? its hard 2 4get abt him:(?	Okay, well, the semester ends tomorrow. and yesterday I told him that I like him. But before I told him, I said he already knew what I wanted to tell him, and he said he didn't know. But then I told him and hes like I already knew! and he also said thats weird because I'm your brother's friend then I messaged him on myspace saying I didn't want to tell you because I thought you wouldn't talk to me, and that I knew he was taken(anymoremore). He said why would you think that? But he didnt mention the taken thing. So I went to school today and to swimming class(class I have with him) and he didn't talk to me today. Does he hate me now that I told him? Or is it just me? And I think that this is the only class I have with him and only this semester none next semester. But I'm not sure.

20090128150441AA3iRch	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Foreign men are more sensitive than american men?	I'm wondering your guy's opinions on this. I used to live in South America...and my ex would even start nearly crying infront of me and stuff and the guys there were really open with their emotions and really into romance and stuff.    My bestfriend pen pal is in South Korea and he's so sensitive and sweet and always says stuff like, "I miss you!><" and my bf is from China and him and all of his Chinese male friends listen to love songs and are really sensitive. Like my bf sings wedding songs/loves to cuddle and his friend's ringtones will be like, "i love you so much that the roses which bloom in the summer..."    I have plenty more examples(like my fake brother from Italy who would play guitar and sing for me and was really sensitive), but overall I've noticed that the typical American man has to be less sensitive etc...I know there are sensitive American men though obviously..like I had a friend on the football team who was always super sensitive and I have some guy friends who are really into talking about their emotions and stuff.   Thanks ^^
20090128134023AAMWCbH	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why are my friends like this?	Ok.... so...I've been friends with these girls since 5th grade!

Yet when I say why don't yall just admit you don't fcuking wanna hang out with me, they say, Ohhh! We LOVE you! Psssh. Yeah right, but why do they treat me like this?

Haha, but I mean, I have jilllllllions other of bestfriends, but why do they not like me all of a sudden (The group of the 4 girls) So.... please tell me! Thanks

20081209011917AAVvNml	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship dilema....?	My boyfriend is a very good person and I love him and see the future together   However there are things that really bother me  and they might be a deal-breaker   He is not an affectionate man by nature: we dont hold hands or sit next to each other and show any pdf .  I like to be close to my man and be physically affectionate (not sleezy) and I talked to him about it many times but to no avail .  We make love MAYBE once a week - it s been like this since day 1 and it used to not bother me quite as much, but now 2 years later i realize I need more love and affection from him.  Im an attractive girl, in shape, long black hair, blu eyes...  but his ways make me feel incompetent and I suffer.  What would you advise me?
20070906165911AAQgfKc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel put off from sex?	I'm normally pretty open minded but my boyfriend told me to be rough with his thing, and i wasn't too sure what that meant, like in what way. i nibbled a little and just before we have sex the next time he says 'you really should be more careful, last time i felt teeth' and it's like i never had that problem before. He is talking like i did it by accident and i dont know how to do it. I found it kind of patronising, and to say right before sex really really put me off. He thought i was put off cos of what he was asking for this time. but i was hurt at the way he told me. i still dont feel like putting any part of my body near any part of him. I mean it was only like one small part of one time we had sex that he's talking about. like one minute out of 30. if he hurt me (which he has!) i'd just say 'honey let me do something for you for a while' or change positions or something. and then say i like that better, do you know what i mean? am i being unreasonable?

I'm not a busty girl, and do not want to wear the shared bras they offer, so I just try them on without a bra...these women do not knock or anything!

And does it bother anyone else?

20090127232355AAHGwOK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why cant you turn a Player into a husband( I know its long but u guys i really need help)! Sorry so LOng!!?	Ok, Ive ben wiT dis guy fa 3 years   Be4 i evn started to like him, he was only my friend. We were actually bestfriends. He told me everything! We told each other everything. See hes was the starting quaterback at school. All the girls love him.      I had a friend that used to go out with him but she said he was a hoe and he wasnt her type. She made it clear that she was completely done with him and nothing could make her get bak with him. Their relationship was very famous. Everyone knew about them. She was the good ol virgin and he was the Jock!     A year or so after they broke...thats when me and him became so cool. We talked everyday about all his past sexual partners and how he cheated on all his girlfriends. EVERYONE! He told me everything and i told him everything too. By him telling me those things made me think I will neva get with him, hes a dog.      The whole while he was trying to get with me. After 8 months i gave in and let him become my boyfriend. I let his friend talk me into thinking..yeah he cheated on those girls but he wont cheat on me. When we first got together the relationship was great. He didnt care that i was a virgin or anything. But all of a sudden i saw him and his ex flirting in the SAME CLASS we took together. IN MY FACE! I confronted him but he said she didnt mean anything. I knew she was trying to break us up. After 2 months i got irritated and told him since you cant let her go then ill go!     So i left and the next day he had a new girlfriend. The same day i relaized i mde a big mistake and that wasnt a good reason to leave someone you love. But he told me i was wrong and he wasnt gon leave his new girl for me. I didnt kow wat to do. I was a virgin then i lost it to him cus i thought we had sum and he didnt tke me back!     He stayd wit this girl for 5 months. The whole time he was with me all day everyday.He was telling me he loved me but going tellin her hw i was crazy and a stalked but he was the one dat always called me. I felt like a sideline girl. I told him over and over if u love me why wont u leave her. And he told me that she had never did anything for him to leave her.        He lead me on tellin me that he was gon break up wit her but n the end she broke up wit him. AND I STILL TOOK HIM BAK!      When we got bak to gether he called me names, talked to me crazy, talk to my mom crazy, and to top it HE CHEATED! I broke up wit him again.       We took sum time apart. He tld me that he missed me and wanted to be back wit me. But soon i found out he was still messin with the girl he cheated on me with and got another new girlfriend. He is 19 and he went and got a very yung girlfriend.      He told me they broke up so i took him back. We got together on thanksgiving but the girl bought him some shoes on christmas. He doesnt stay down here anymore...same state but different city. Were still together but he acts like he love me but yet he jus doesnt care. I think his cheating with the very yung girl. I dont know..     He doesnt have a phone, car, or job. And he bases his life off football. He once told me i wasnt the type of girl that a football player will marry because i dont have long hair and bright skinn!! WHAT SHUD I DO! STAY OR GO
20080928094912AABsK3g	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I tell him...? I don't want to lose him as a friend..?	Well there's this guy and we're pretty good friends. I've never actually met him in person, but we talk a lot, and we talk about everything. The problem is..he likes me. A lot apparently. He keeps acting really sweet and everything but everytime I don't act the same way he gets depressed. I like him...but not in that way really. I have a boyfriend and he knows that. How can I get him to stop feeling depressed? How can I let him know that I'm just not interested in him that way...without losing him as a friend?
20090128145123AAJMwR8	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does anyone think this is wrong?	ok, when my boyfriend and i got together almost a year ago, i didnt complelty trust(cuz i had been raped by my dad and the relationship i was in right before him also raped me) so by technically i called myself a virgin, well bout 2 months in i had sex with my bf. but when we did i still didnt know if i loved him. well today, (bout 15 days from our 1 year) we were fightin (again) and well a few months back i cheated on him alot.... and he asked me y well it was cuz i felt alone, i couldnt see him but 2 days a week for about an hour or 2 a day. and i felt un loved and alone. and well he proposed to me bout 5 months back and now he questions if i ment i love you to him.... and he questions everything. if i love him, if ill cheat and stuff like that..... i know he;ll always have a side of him that will question if i cheat... but how can i prove to him... that i really love him... becausei do.... and ive been crying all day becuz he wont talk to me since our fight....

20090128131638AAsowhO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need some opinions from people...please?	Ok so im trying to get over a fella. I actually love him. And i know its love, not someone i'd say "i love you" to just because i like him alot. Like lots of people do.    I see him differently to any other guy ive been with. I cant find a single thing wrong with his appearance, his personality, or things hes into.  The only fault i can find in him is the fact he can be a complete jerk when he wants to be. Apart from that hes pretty perfect to me.    Does anyone think i can find another fella like this? I find it real hard to think i can :( May sound stupid but its as tho noone compares to him. I dont wanna completely give up on trying to find someone that makes me feel like that :(    But i have to give up on him...    Please no rude comments. Thanks in advance :)
20081001002027AAOMzx5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, what's the significance of smacking your girl's butt?	I've heard many things about the meaning of it:      - it's one of the ways a dude shows his love.    - it's an affectionate gesture   - it's ownership - like "i smack this, my girl!"   - it's another way of saying, "this is mine!"   - it's his way of telling you and thinking he admires your butt      Besides giving a "guy meaning", what's the emotional meanng and intention behind butt slapping?

My MOH and BM's are throwing me a bridal shower next month, and have been after me for over a month to build a registry for my trousseau. I still haven't done this, and figured they could find items on their own. Then I began shopping for myself for items for my honeymoon, but haven't found anything in great quantity that I adore. So far, only a few items at Neiman Marcus. I could use some suggestions from you ladies. Where did you find items to build your trousseau?? Thanks.

20090128131852AApGyf7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Needing advice on how to deal with my In-Laws?	My husband and I haven't talked to his parents in over 3 years on our own choosing. They have treated us like we're children and end up doing really rude things on holidays like screaming at us when we go there for christmas about how we are really stupid and will never make it in life if we choose to buy a car while my husband is in college. (just a $9,000.00 dollar car)theyalways put our goals and ideas down. We don't go there for holidays because it compleatly ruins a perfectly nice 4 day weekend that we could be sharing with my family who love us both so much. Their advice would be accepted if they were able to not (MIL cry hestaricly) and  FIL yell and be really loud and angry.I don't know how to tell my mother in law who still sends gifts and cards for everything ( vday anniversary bday christmas easter thanksgiving and just "HI") without being rude that these gifts and cards and $ just get sent back to her or given to the thrift shop or sum donation and that we do not want them back in our lives until they say they are sorry and they want to start fresh. The last time we talked to them she said if she were do everything over again, she would be the same because she hasn't done anything wrong and my FIL feels the same way. I want to talk to them, but they are so overbearing and judgemental that we feel we can't breath around them. My husband wants nothing more then to live our own lives and he hasn't talked to them in 3 years, except at his Grandpas death bed where my mother in law made the whole thing about her, talking to my husband about how she was upset at him for not calling and it was his "grandpas last wish" over his grandpas body, making him feel so guilty and horrible because he was really emotional and I think when he remembers that now he hates her for that. My questions are, how can I stop the cards and gifts? It seems to really upset my husband. How can I make peace? Is there a way to get along? I have tried to tell her please don't send things but she continues. And I have tried to be nice and once in a while respond to her tex, just saying "hi". What is your advice to me?

20090128145402AASffL1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	GF has packed on 50 pounds since we met?	she was in great shape for her last BF, but since she's known me (4+ years) she has steadily put on at leasst 50 pounds of fat. And thats just what the scale can pick up, god knows how much of her "used to be" muscle has just turned INTO fat.      Before you all turn on me for being a shallow jerk, let me add that we have talked about this numerous times, and she hasn't made even an ATTEMPT to get into shape. I told her it's as easy as lifting some weights once in awhile, at least TRY to show like you care, and, shocker, it's been 3 weeks and not even a faster pace to the fridge.       I feel like she's spitting in my face, caring so little about her appearance to herself or to me, like she doesn't feel she needs to be in shape for me becuz I dont deserve it. Ive ruled out that she's just comfortable around me, and thats why shes gotten so laxed on her appearance, because after the numerous talks weve had, she knows something needs to be done, and yet still shows no signs of giving 2 sh*ts.       So is there any hope or does she just not care anymore? Because I am starting not to care anymore either.

20090128095410AARuoUy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	For dominate and submissive people .. please help me.?	ok. so i have always been into the whole sub. dom. lifestyle.   I have read so much about it, I could probably write a book on it, yet I havent gotten to really really try it .    I have told my current boyfriend of over a year how I would enjoy it.   We tried it but its kinda like just not him i guess.   Even though, somewhere down in everyone there is a part of it.   It turned him on when we would play, but like i dont really want to ( play) until the real thing is said and done.   How do you think I could make him become more dominate w/o making it obvious.   When we fight, I scream and everything and he doesnt do anything.   I dont want an ABUSIVE relationship, i dont want to be punched in the face, kicked on the sides ,. things thrown at my head, but i dont want to be in control. i want to be tossed around a bit, and slapped , and yelled at , and even if it doesnt lead to like spankins just anything.   I try and make the simplest things turn into it w.o him knowing but like he doesnt get it.   Is there anything I could do??      I can give a fantasy of mine;)       Like... say i went out w/ my friends one night and went to a club.    He calls me and tells me to be home by like 2   so around 1 30ish i turn my phone off and continue on with my night.   I end up crashing at my friends house because im really drunk and dont want to go home.    In the morning around 10ish I get up and go home   When i pull in the drive way he is out working on his old fix up car   the neighbors are out side and he doesnt want to cause a sene so he calls me over there, puts his arm around me like hes hugging me and he holds me really tight and tells me to get in the house and take a shower.   When i get out of the shower he is standing in the bathroom.   He grabs me by my neck and throws me up againt the wall and starts screaming and hitting and telling me how bad i am.    He takes away privilages and so on and so on...      like. I dont really wantthe whole bondage thing   I guess i just want a man in charge.   How could i possibly make him be like that???      He knows about my past.    As a child I was raped and i guess i havent been able to really get over it. and they say alot of people who are submissive have suffered from some kind of sexual way but i also dont think that is the only reason i am like this.
20080502112405AA6aIOa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I stop worrying about this?	I think maybe this is other women as well not just me, but sometimes I feel a little self conscious about my body when my boyfriend and I are together because I am a "thick" girl. Are guys even paying attention to everything I'm worrying about? Or should I just forget about it and go with the moment? I guess this question is more towards the guys, do you notice or concentrate on a woman's imperfections during sex or am I the only one concerned about it?

20090128090742AAf9a2A	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My soon to be EX asking for more money without court orders. What to do?	Times are hard and the economy has slowed.  I have been separated and in the divorce process for over a year.  My wife asked for the divorce. We lost our house and are trying to negotiate a visitation schedule for our toddler.  She moved into a brand new town home and continued to party and travel.  Now she is strapped for money and keeps asking for rent money.  Once last year at the beginning of the separation she asked and I gave her $500. This past month she cried on my shoulder and asked for more money again.  I gave her $500 one day and then came back and gave her $500 more.  For a total of $1000 for January.  Now she is asking for rent money again.  She chose the most expensive place to move into and always has her hair done and nails too.  I am leasing an older home and fixing it up for when our child visits me. Money is tight. She wants out.  I pay for our child and her medical benefits, a loan in our names and 1/2 daycare.  No court orders have been issued for alimony or child support. I have offered her a room to stay in the three bedroom I am leasing.  Our child has her own room.  Should I give her any more assistance?

SO, she has a promise ring and she is obviously wanting me to ask her out, what gives? what should I do because this girl is cute as hell, i like her too, but im dont want to ask her out if she has a guy

20090128145449AA9bXgA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if you thought your husband was cheating on you and you are 8 1/2 months pregnant?	I am eight and a half months pregnant with our third child. I am a stay at home mom and my husband works in law enforcement. His shift is later in the evening from 3:00pm-1:00am...there has been several instances where he doesn't get home until much later than I expect him (2:30am, 3am, 4am) and every time, he says he got caught up in something at work. At first I believed him. Until I started looking at his cell phone and finding only parts of text messaging conversations (as if he was deleting messages so that I wouldn't see) now his phone is always in his pocket, he never leaves it in plain sight. Today, I was looking at someone I know's facebook, and there was recent pictures on their profile of my husband at a party with his arm around another woman.  He was wearing what he wears to work, so I know he went there after work...and then came home to me after wards.       I don't know what to do about this. I feel like an emotional wreck already with all the hormones and now this on top of it. I just don't know how to deal with it. I don't have anywhere to go and I have not only myself to think about, I have our 2 children and the baby I am carrying to think about as well.  what should i do?

20090128145841AALgxq2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys opinion help!!               ?	I've been talking to this guy I met a month ago and he goes to school a couple hours away now, but we've been talking only via aim. We don't have each others numbers.   But I can't tell if he likes me or not and I don't know what to do next.      Sometimes he'll say stuff that's really nice like, I'm a great person and he respects me and stuff like that. But he can be really unresponsive sometimes and not reply back to me for 15 minutes and then come back with just an "lol" or something little like that.   This morning he asked me a question, I answered, and he didn't reply for 3 minutes and then just signed off.   I want to talk to him more because I do realize that some people are just busy or something comes up, but I don't know what to say.      I told him once before that I don't IM people because I want them to IM me so I know that they actually want to talk with me, but he said to feel free to IM him anytime. So sometimes, I do, and I feel like I should if I sign on now, but I don't know what I would say to him.      If he doesn't like me, I don't want to keep making a fool of myself.

20090128140112AAGhM7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my boyfriend just not care anymore?	So here's the deal. I'm 17 and my boyfriend is 15. From the day we met we had a good amount of chemistry. He has an outgoing, loud, and funny personality like I do. He first used to text me a lot, write me cute notes, walk me to class, call me every night, etc. BUt lately he seems to not care. He always ignores me in front of his friends and he seems to blow me off for them until he notices that I'm upset and tries to hug me and be sweet and stuff. He's always happy-go-lucky around everyone else but me. Now he hardly texts me during the day, no notes or calls, walks me to like one class, and I feel like I'm the one that has to ask to do stuff all the time. Most of the time, he comes up with an excuse as to why he can't. And he's a lot more active around his other guy friends, as well as talks about other hot guys around me in great detail with his friends. I've confronted him about it and he assures me that he loves me unconditionally. Some of his friends admit to me that he really does love me, and he's asked the most intimate things of me, but I am starting to feel like maybe I'm wasting time. I do love him a lot, and I would never hurt him.

20080927071237AAZg7lh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELPPP! likes me? or playing me?	i emailed this guy saying "do you like me?" - i thought he must do because he'd been sending me all the right signals - then in his reply he said "I love you. In all seriousness I think you're a very cool person" what does this mean?! "love" makes it seem like its a joke - becoz he would only like me, but he doesn't seem the cruel type. is he trying to let me down nicely or too shy to tell me that he actually likes me? its just that in real life he almost makes it obvious that he does like me! i dont know what to think now. THANKS      I should also mention that a good friend of his likes me a lot and has done for quite some time - i also kind of rejected (that sounds bad!) his friend - could this be why he is holding back??
20081115000318AAYvc4h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is she doing, why?	There is this girl. Me and her were taking things slow, we were sort of in a relationship, sort of not. We wanted to build up to it. We had great conversations! Just, amazing. We both said that what we had going was wonderful because, first and foremost, we were great friends. The past few weeks, it's like all the "magic" of our conversations has went away. We used to do this thing, where we touch palms whenever we had to leave and we'd say, "I really care for you." One day, she touched palms, but just said, "Bye." And, well, this sort of all coincided with how she has started being really stressed out with coursework lately, and I have been trying to find out why she's suddenly not seeming so happy. She told me she had feelings that she wasn't good enough for her career, etc. I sent her a long email, which was really motivational, and she replied with a long one, saying it made her feel amazing, that it really helped, that she still really cared about me. That was EARLIER TODAY.    Well, okay, we go to different universities, actually, but I emailed her university earlier in the week asking them to just deliver a typed message to her, that she would know was from me because of the context. She found out about it today, but said it was very immature of me and she knows my intentions were good, but it made her feel embarrassed that the staff knew about it, and that I should have known better.    I apologized, sincerely. She said okay, but I should have known better.     We also, besides seeing each other in person, often chat on webcamera with a phone if we can't see other that night, and there was one night where I wanted to keep talking, and we talked until 3am, and I knew she had class at 8am.     So I was asking her why we were talking in tones like this right now, blaming each other, not talking like before. She said that she felt I was just not being understanding and that my support felt fake, like I would send nice motivational messages, but then want to talk to her about stuff again when I knew she had to get things done.     Well, I also told her I was hurt because she said I wasn't understanding her, but why does she say this when I took the time to write a 5-page email to her about how things in life can be difficult, and that I know she can make it through this... And she just sort of said, "Ok. Well, I am busy with a paper right now."      I know I have made some mistakes. I feel like it's not that she doesn't have feelings for me, but that she's genuinely upset that I haven't understood her... And I also have a feeling like she's almost being a bit... unfair. I have sincerely apologized, and told her that I understand that, as a good friend first and foremost, I should give her space... But she insists on saying, "Ok." Just sort of giving me this cold shoulder... Like right now, I feel that she feels that she has a position of power and she's sort of using it to hurt me a little, or at least to rub in my past mistakes. I feel like she really wants to teach me a lesson. Something like that.    Can someone help me? What can I do? I know this relationship isn't over. It really just feels like a struggle. But I haven't had a relationship before real enough where I've really been at such a juncture of misunderstanding, of conflict. I'm not sure how to handle it. Should I just stop talking, and let my actions speak for themselves, just by giving her space? It doesn't make sense to me... Only TODAY she said she cared for me, then she got word of that message I tried to send to her through her university, and she's giving me the cold shoulder, even though she says she knows fully that my intentions were good.     What is she doing? What should I do?     Please help me.     Thank you.

Anyway, I met this girl via myspace. Again I know pretty lame. I got interested in her and got her phone number and text her a lot. I got the impression that she liked me. I'm not the most attractive guy in the world, but what I lack in looks I make up for in my personality. Im really funny and kinda sensitive. She told me that a lot of what I said was really cute. Anyways, she told me that she wanted to hang out. Couple days later I asked her if she wanted to hang out that day, and she said if I wanted to. So I drove 40 min out and text her and told her that i was 2 min away and wanted to hang, she said she couldn't and she felt bad. Now, it feels like shes ignoring me. She said she broke her phone, but a few days later, I read a comment from one of her best friends that asked her if she got her phone back?!?! I also feel like I might be coming on to strong. I asked her to see a movie with me this Saturday and she said she might be able to. I don't know what to think now. Anyone got any advise?

20071103165959AAWZ11x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't get guys!! help me please!!?	Ok, so i have a confusion and i was wondering if you could help. To start off, theres this guy, lets call him bob. So i used to like bob, about less than a year ago, anyways, that was in seventh grade. Now we are in 8th grade, and he, of course found out. One day during 1 of my classes his friend asks me if it was true I liked bob. I, of course, denied. Anyways, i decide to confront him, and tell it to him straight, wrong move. I only have 1 class with him, and its the last class of the day, so i go and confront him..i was shaking inside the whole time..and him bozo friend was snooping until i asked him to leave. When i told him i needed to talk to him, he was lyk:omg, who's this girl! IDK you, why do we need to talk? yes, very immature! Anyways, 2 weeks pass by, i think, and my friend (i swear idk y!!) goes and asks him if he lyked me!! he said no, that just because i lyked him duznt mean he has 2 lyk me, and somewhere in there he called me fat. I didnt confront him this time..
20081020193430AAbIzyP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Talking on love, looking for a thoughtful response?	Actually, its not really a question, more of a read it and tell me what you think. to be honest with you, i have troubble talking about this sort of thing, but if i cant see the face of the person im talking to, it makes it easier, hence the question.    all my life, since i had first heart about what love was i was skeptical about the whole thing. how in the world, can there be just one person out there for you? thats just stupid, theres 6 billion people in the world there has to be at least two. regardless, i came to the conclusion long ago that no one ever finds true love, and that true love, or even love at all doesnt even exist, that we simply find someone who has a trait similar to ours, that we find admirable, and we settle down with said person, that we learn to tolerate them rather than falling in love. i formulated this view on the fact that those who fall in love end up getting hurt, so why bother. that people who get emotionally involved end up getting stepped on, and that the best way to avoid a broken heart is to pretend that you dont have one. and so far, its worked for me.    recently, ive found myself drawn to a certain person, and the more im with her, the more my views on love are challanged, but then i look at a former friend of mine, whos life has been torn apart by her boyfriend, yet she wont break up with him, beucase shes in way to deep, which brings me back to my point of just avoiding the whole thing. it just seems easier. so im avoiding falling in love, or even admiting that i might have a love like feeling for anyone.    anothe thing, ive allways heard that its better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all, but again i look around at friends who have been dumped and there totally wrecked, then i look in the mirror and well im in better shape than they are, so what the heck? why would someone say that, becase its obviously not true.    i cringe at even the thought of love, and im 100% against marriage as well, settling down with someone seems like an easy way to end up a broken shadow of what you used to be. So why bothor with it at all? whats the point in falling in love just to be broken and destroyed later on in life?    anyway, to anyone who actually chose to read this long passage i thank you, and if you chose to respond to it, well than i thank you even more.    and please dont tell me im emotionally damaged becase someone didnt love me enough, because...well i already know that. just give your opinion on what i said.

I've always had low self-esteem but lately I've been coming into my own and have started feeling very self-assured. The problem is the more i realize who i realy am the less attracted I am to my fiancee. I can't stand his habits or the way he speaks to me, I realy try to avoid sex with him because I find his penis offensive.

20080927170547AAvIWDe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Second time asking, really need ADVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	There may be a lot of questions like this but..... i need more opinions...................   ok, so, to shorten this story up, there was this guy (don't all love stories start with there was this one guy?? lol) and well, we basically fell in love for eachother. the real love, where you can really tell and know you're in it. and we wern't "dating" (im 14) or making it official.. i started to wonder about this, and finally he told me that he didn't want to make it official now because he didn't know if it would last, like all those cheap middle school relatiohsips don't last. so he said he wanted to expericence other things, instead of being with the same girl forever. and that he would date someone else for the time being. but. he wants to date me in highschool, and start our relatioship then... btw, it's kinda a long-distance thing, i see him every other weekend...      do you think he'll come back? i know i sound like a silly lovestruck girl, but i really need opinions................... thank you :)

20090128133526AAEpWV7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend's embarrassed about her body?	Hi, I've been with my girlfriend about a year and a half now, and we've known each other for about 5 years. However, her sister has always put her down about her body, telling her she's 'fat' and ugly - this couldn't be further from the truth, and I certainly don't think any of them things!      Because of this she doesn't let me see her naked at all, which obviously hinders our relationship (we're both 19). I just wish I could help her see that even if she has got a horrible bum etc I wouldn't care, and I'd much rather have us both enjoy our sex life.      Is there anything I can do to help her confidence?      Thanks

She was like I can hook you up,and I said I don't like nobody in the skool I only like one person and she looked deep into my eyes.She told me this guy(rodney) that I know likes her but she doesn't like the guy and she even told me where she lives( we talked for about 10 minutes and I walked her to the main entrance)she really pays attention to whatever I tell her and she gives me all the smiles.She even ask for my name and my grade and she said am cool, am not like the other guys,and I was like are we cool and she said yes but I need to get to know you more.       I really like her, do you think she likes me ?Nb; she finally told rodney she doesn't like rodney but she likes someoneelse and riight know she keeps on pointing at me to her friends whenever I see her. does she likes me or what?      She saw me standing next to my locker and she didn't even say hi, she just walked away and she saw me today and I try not to talk to her and she said, now you don't say hi no more and I said I didn't see her, I also said you don't even talk to me and she said because I don't see you. I ask her so whatz up and she said nothing but what about you and I said nothing and she saw her bus and said bye.       does she like me. we didn't say hi or talk for 1 week and she said hi to me today and I ask her can I walk you to class and she said okay and she was like, I you not going to be late? and I said is nothing and whiles we were taking she was holding her necklace and asking about my classes.i finally ask for her number again and she said her parents are strict and dont allow her to talk on the phone andshe said she hasn't seen me ina while, and i was like i was sick and she said i hope u get better.she also said she knows me know since she said she want to know me? should i just be friends with her or go for it

20071005140303AAGbB9B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've never dated or have had a boyfriend. What's wrong?	No big deal, but these days I'm just wondering. 19, female. No special guy ever comes around. I just want a guy that I like who likes me back. We can have stimulating conversations. Yeah, I can be pleasant and attractive looking, but I don't want to lead guys on. I'm tired of guys misinterpreting everything. When I want to be friends, they think it's more. When I want more they want only friendship. I'm not like most girls you meet. I have my own little interests and opinions. Will something nice ever come along? What was your first time like?

20081001032645AAKWX9r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Tell Him? Or Not Tell him?	I have a relationship for about 15 months now.    And around 3 months ago, we moved to a new house and start to live together.   But since then, I found out that he was still with his girlfriend 2 months before we moved together that he said that he broke up already when he met me at the first time and he signed up to the local matchmaker online and met another girl via that site. I found his emails to them and It was hurting me so much.      I asked him about it without telling me that I know everything.   Of course he denied it but he doesn't know that I know about his emails that show everything that he had done.      If I asked him about it, he will be very angry and become so aggressive But yesterday I told him that I don't need this in my life anymore and would love to leave him. But he still not telling me the truth.      What can I do?   
20081002070457AA0O2Ev	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make her feel better?	My girlfriend has been feeling really bad about herself lately. She hates being around other girls because it makes her feel inadequate and unattractive. She also thinks that if I'm around other girls I'll be attracted to one of them more and I'll leave her (which would never happen; I love her and I'd never break her heart like that.) She's scared I'll fall in love with a prettier, thinner girl and I'll break up with her. I don't want her to feel so unhappy about herself and I don't want her to doubt herself and compare herself to other girls—she's the only one I'll ever love and those other girls don't matter to me.      How can I make her understand that I love her no matter what, and I'll never leave her? How can I make her feel better about herself?

20081114232320AASecyh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to break-up with boyfriend....?	Ok so here it goes, i'll try to be detailed, but not bore you.      Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years...Since I was 16. Everything has been great but things are getting worse. Hes a very unmotivated person. He has a job at a local department store, making minimum wage with no goals for the future. I on the other hand, work in a hospital making almost double what he makes, and have goals.      This past year has been tough. We have been fighting about every little thing, and most of the time, the fights don't make sense, and these fights happen about 5 days a week...      The last time he said "I love you" was about 3 years ago, because he believes that if you truly love someone, you don't have to say it to prove to them...      I'm just very frustrated with the way things are going, and was wondering if anyone can help me on breaking up with him. He was my only boyfriend, so I have never done this before. Or maybe just give me some tips.       Keep in mind, this is not the entire story between us, I am keeping some things out purposely.      Thanks!   Joe

20090127185613AAO96lC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex was evicted while using her weekend visitation. Do I have to let them got back if she has no place to live?	My ex has 1st and 3rd weekend visitation with our two boys 8 and 7.  Last weekend she had them and was evicted so she spent the entire weekend moving out to her friends house.  She told them she was putting their stuff in storage.  (She has done this before when she divorced her 5th husband and they never saw their things again). They spent Friday night on one mans floor and Saturday night on another man and women's couch.  She is suppose to certify me her new address every time she moves or changes numbers (per divorce agreement) but she never has and has moved 4 times and had 12 new numbers in the past 3 years.  Can I not let them go until she certifies me her new permanent address so I at least know where they will be?  Let me add that the last weekend she had them was the 1st time since Christmas morning (3 weeks) and they spent more time with her mom and over other peoples houses then with her. I don't feel safe letting them bounce from place to place when they could be safe at home with me, their stepmom and sisters.

Ok, 3 questions for GUYS.      1) When you were younger, like 6th 7th 8th grade what did you look for in a girl? Did you like the ones you acted more grown up? Good grades? Bad grades? Or girls that LOOKED more grown up? Like ones who wore make up and were more developed.        2) Do you like girls to be shorter than you or taller?   +would it be weird to date the opposite of what you picked?      3) What do you look for in a girls FACE? Eyes? What color? Hair what color? What length.        Please star this question!   ???-May

Okay, so I'm 5'6 and my best friend is 4'11 and we look pretty weird standing next to each other, haha, but we were having a discussion about whether guys find tall or short girls more attractive..?She says that guys find shorter girls more attractive because they feel more manly next to them but I don;t really know, so can i get a guy's point of view? By a tall girl I don't mean like, 5'11 or 6 foot, I mean like 5'6- 5'9 ish.

I really want to tell her how I feel just to get it out of me. We used to talk online everyday, but now we never talk anymore. I think she "blocked" me on msn messenger.

20090128182252AAJ0gfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a problem, PLEASE HELP!?	The girl I like has been showing increased signs of interest towards me, and I'm pretty sure of it. I have yet to ask for her phone number (cell phone... we are neighbors and long time friends, so I already know her home phone), but I tried today. The thing is, I choked right when I was going to ask for it. I just can't seem to get the message out, even simply saying "Hey, what's your number?"  How can I stop choking up at the worst moments and just ask her out? I've been thinking it's because I don't know what to do if she says yes. I don't want to go to a movie, that's too common and too pressured. I can't drive, so I'm in the middle of rides and what not.   I recently moved away from being her neighbor for 3 1/2 months (its not too far, maybe a 10 minute bike ride). I told her and her mouth was slightly open and confused, so she obviously wanted to take advantage of us being neighbors to make it an easy date.   I was thinking of a group thing, but I don't know how I would organize that. I'm really confused about all this, and just need some experienced help.
20090128172925AAvpJv7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Got dumped cuz I don't want kids? This a good reason?	I was in a 3-year relationship with her and she suddenly broke up with me cuz I told her I never wanted kids. She thought I was selfish but I didn't mind having a toddler to share my big house with and I even have extra rooms for kids that I can use for him.      But, I just didn't want to share my love, and being with divorced parents, I realized that children doesn't really make couples any happier, I thought this was an unselfish reason. What do you think? Shouldn't that mean that she didn't love me for me all this time?

She owes me like $600 total, and the other day I saw her with a new laptop, what a bi1ch, she is never going to pay me back.      I also have a friend who constantly mooches off of me, he borrows everything from money, textbooks for college, and even my car when he already has his own to drive, WTF. He was afraid to drive his own car because his registration expired, and didn't want to drive it, so he took my car without even asking me, we're roommates by the way. He even uses my textbooks and doesn't ask me and doesn't take care of them, the value of the books are down because of him, what a jackoff.      Do any of you have family or friends like this?

20090128181408AAW61V9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice please? Is there potential here?	There's a guy I go to school with, I've never had a class with him but there have been some things that have happened that make me think.      a while back [about 2 months ago?] my friends and i were outside waiting for a ride home when Eli [the guy's name] comes to join us. We were talking as a group, he and i talked to each other in the conversation, and when his ride came, he asked me my name and told me his.      The next few days we saw each other in the hall but just said hi because we both had to get to class.      Today, I was walking to class when I sensed someone walking close behind me. It was him. Then he got beside me as we walked.   I kind of felt happy so i said "Howdy!" [lol] and we exchanged "how are you"s. It was short, but I'd thought he'd forgotten about meeting me.      I like this guy, but I don't see him much at all and I don't know if he's interested as well or if I've just been over analyzing.      What do you think? Is his walking close behind me a sign, or am i thinking too hard? Also, should I show him my interest, and how, since we dnt see each other often?

Yepp.   He's been an asshole for the longest time and so far i've put up with it.    But today he got dared to tell me it was over (as a joke) and then he had his friend Lewis tell me.    I was pissed when Lewis admitted to em that it was a joke.   So I broke up with him by email because I can't take it anymore. I need a break and I seriously can't stand him these days.    I also was planning to ask Michael, this kid in my French class to the dance.    Because he's cute, hehe.      I oddly feel relieved but kinda dissappointed, like when I got a sixty-four on my math test.       You know how that feels?      Yeah.       That's it.

20090128154020AAYZyQr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is there, besides dating and sex?	I'm at a crossroads. I recently left the dating scene after 4 failed relationships ( I lost interest in all the girls after about two weeks. ) so I no longer desire to date or have a relationship with anyone, unless I meet someone so amazing as to change my mind (but I doubt it).      Now, I also am not the kind of person who just wants to go have sex with anyone I meet. I have a moral code and I follow it. I would only have sex with a wife or something similar (MY wife, I should say). Anyway, that moves me on to my problem.      I am pretty much girl crazy. I flirt all the time, I love girls, I can't get enough of beautiful women, people with great personalities, whatever, I am just super attracted to a lot of really awesome people.      Anyway, I am not sure what to do with all my pent up attraction. Is there a way I can still be with girls I like without dating them or having random sex? Thanks in advance.
20090128161926AAjiuaj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do about being a step mom?	I met a really great guy and we are talking about getting married.Things are finally great.The problem is I am jealous of his ex (kids mom).I know that's really bad.Its just I was in a bad,hurtful relationship,and have been cheated on.I worry about my new guy always calling his ex,going places with her,joking/playing around,and so on.I know he has to be nice for his sons sake but how can I get my feelings straight before I screw this up?This is the second time I cannot get it out of my head that they are to close.I have seen so many bad relationships I don't know what to do.Any tips from step parents also.

20090128181632AA93ZSR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend doesnt understand that i don't want to have sex! advise?	first of all, i am a virgin. but lately we've been kissing and stuff a lottt. now when he comes over he goes straight to my room. he expects me to follow him but i don't want our relationship to just physical!    i confronted him about it the other day but things havent changed.    what should i do? (without breaking up with him)
20090128164716AAA4pwg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get the point across without hurting him?	So there is this guy who obviously likes me, from afar and up close.  It actually depends on the day which approach he takes.  The problem is that he is really socially awkward and really...greasy.  That is really the only appropriate adjective for him.  He has greasy hair and just a greasy demeanor about him.    I am a nice person.  I hate hurting people.  But this guy is persistent.  He has liked me for about a year and a half now.  He continues to stare at me from across the room at school and I just want to curl up and hide!  I have already tried looking less attractive at school to see if maybe he just stares because I look good on certain days.  But no, he stares just the same.    When he talks to me, I feel terrible because he compliments me and I thank him and try to treat him just like anyone else, but I feel so awkward around him.    The biggest problem is that if I dis him or if he asks me out and I say no, he will be heartbroken forever.  He has zero self esteem and I don't want to crush him any more than needs to be.  I mean, this kid could go and cry in a corner or go ballistic or maybe even go suicidal.  You just can't predict him.    I want to just ignore him until graduation in June.  But it makes life so awkward.  What should I do to preserve whatever self esteem he has at the moment?  I can't go out with him.  He is really nice, but I get this involuntary shudder every time he is near.  He is just creepy...    And now I feel terrible.  =(  I guess that is just the truth though...

I'm doing the online dating thing right now and I'm always incredibly gracious to women but they never seem to care. Not caring results in no replies. They all seem to be looking for the 'edgy bad boy' but I know 'edgy bad boys' and they treat their attractive girls like crap. I don't get it?

Not necessarily using her for sex, or planning on dumping her and laughing at her or to say im a pimp or anything like that.  I'm basically just bored and figure i could get more experience dating, and have someone to hang out with cuz i don't have a lot to keep me busy right now.  I'm not saying i don't like her at all, but i don't see myself marrying her or anything long term.  Just curious about your opinions.

20090128152114AAilvM7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When it comes to dating and relationships, why am I never happy with what I have?	Maybe I'm still too young.      The people who I date or take interest in, once I realize that they like me, I move on.       I feel like I'm always after those who don't feel the same for me as I do for them. But, if they do, I grow tired, bored. Then move on.      Why is this?   I don't want to be like this.      I want to find happiness and joy in her, always and forever.       Hopefully, its a fault of being young, and will change with maturity.

20090128151253AAHAc7o	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't get it... why is my best friend acting like this?	My best friend and i have been friends since the 1st week of college freshmen year. We are sophomores now and in our 2nd semester. Every since the summer she ignores me and does not talk to me for four months right when school is about to end and then all of a sudden out of nowhere she calls me one day and wants to hang out (after 4 months). She has been doing that since the summer. and we just started college a week ago and now she has been ignoring me for some reason. like whenever i txt her she won't reply, and when i ask her bf ( he lies to me saying he is on his way to class) when they are actually on break. Her bf and i have been friends for 7 yrs, we r high school buddies. i do not know why they both keep doing this?! they keep breaking up every week and getting back ( i dunno they r confused) i feel like im being used whenever she wants someone to talk to about her crappy cheating bf and about her family drama. Im not making it a big deal, but honestly we are 20 and not childish to play these games around. I rather be alone and hang out with my other friends and my boyfriend, then deal with there drama. How can i say tell them about this situation, how i feel n stuff?! cuz i am tired, and i can be rude when i want to. but i rather choose not to. i jus want to tell them this, so they can stop making me feel like a loser =( ][sorry it was long ][ any suggestions or ideas will b helpful. thank you!

20090128175936AAlQK52	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend is obsessed with History class?	Since my friend started grade 9 she's been completely inlove with hisotry class anything pre 2000. I mean, she was always into the 80's and stuff but now she spends tons of extra time doing grade 10 (we're rgade 9) history assignements for fun and watching the Grate Gadspe.      We go to the oldest Highschool in Toronto so there are all these old photos, colages, and invitations framed up on one of the walls when we passed by them she started getting oddly excited about how old they were she kept raving on and on about how old our shcool was and how cool it was that people who'd served in the first world war had gone to school here and all these different things.      During fourth period she randomly walks out of the classroom and i find her just reading (smiling as she does) the old frames-she's obviously read them all about 50 times each.      she's a chearleader, a party girl, probably one of the prettiest girls at school she wears all american apparel, has a senior boyfriend and a monroe piercing. I mean is this weird?      The thing that worries me is that if feel like she isn't happy when she isn't around those things, like.. she feels as if she should have been born in those times and now a part of her is missing because she's stuck in the 24th century. How can i make her feel better?

20090128171133AAXuLzv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unfinished business with ex gf. Ladies some advice ?	K well my and my gf were forced to break up in the summer cause her parents found out we had sex. Yeah short we havent seen eachother since and its really hard. I can tell she has feelings for me, but she says shes just doing what her parents want her to. Which sucks but i can see why. We didnt have a normal break up, her parents ripped us apart after being friends for almsot 3 years, and a couple for one.       Its been over 8 months, and i still have feelings for her. I honestly dont know what to do. no matter what i try, my feelings for her dont go away. Even with no talking, its seems to be worse. I'm really lost on what to do and where to go from here. i'm 18 but she still has till may till she turns 18 so her parents are using that. Everything happened when we were both 17.      K so, i feel we have a loose end. We never got to say goodbye in person. She said her parents gave her a chance to, but she said it woudl hurt to much to have to say goodbye. But because of that, i cant loose her. I've tried to tell her that if she meets me one time, i'll never bother her again, but everytime she says she cant cause she doesnt want to get in trouble even thought she talks to me everyday through text and AIM. So i dont get it. But there cant be closure till we meet in person, talk and say goodbye. But she just wont do it.       Can i get any advice? Idk what to ask but whatever you feel right to say? And dont say just forget her and move on, cause that isnt gunna work.
20090128163453AAlVP5q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is pre marriage sexual experience helpful for after marriage?	I am thinking about one common opinion suggesting that if an individual experience different people of the opposite sex, then after marriage has less temptation and sexual desires toward them.   On the other hand, some people believe the least pre marriage experience gives the more chance of having a happy sexual life after marriage since the individual will not compare their partner to their previous partners, so they feel more satisfied.    I don’t have and am not in favor of the first opinion, but I am just afraid that might be true, then I might feel regret of not having enough experience before marriage. This has occupied my mind very much and I need your help, if you have been through similar concerns.

20090128171223AADwcqU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you become attracted to someone who isn't your type?	Hi, I have been broken up with my boyfriend for 4 months now.  I was and totally am in love with him still.  We see each other and still sleep with each other.  I know, giving him the relationship benefits without the relationship.  Believe me, I want to stop loving him.  Now, I have a friend who is really nice, really sweet and totally wants to go out with me and says he has started falling for me.  We hang out and he has been there through some really bad times when my ex was no where to be found.  I have always been honest with him regarding my feelings, but I would love to be able to fall in love with this man because he would be so good to me, not like my ex who ended up lying a lot to me.  My problem is that this friend is not my type at all.  I go for the latin looking men - always have.  He is blonde, kinda bald with blue eyes.  He's not ugly, but I don't see anything handsome about him.  I do love him like a best friend.  I am just not attracted to him at all physically.        How can I get over my ex and try and develop feelings for this other guy?  Any suggestions or am I just out of luck?

Hes amazing... dark hair, hockey player, nicest eyes ever, but hes a junior and Im a freshman. It sounds dumb but I think Im really falling for him but Ive never actually talked to him and not sure if he knows that I exist. At lunch I always catch him staring at our table and same with his friend that used to be my neighbor but I lost contact with. And I know that his friend knows who I am, there is know doubt. The problem with liking him is that we are 2 years apart and I am so inexperienced. I havent had too many boyfriends, and haven't had my first real kiss yet so even if he does like me, I would be so akward and embarrass myself.   Please give me advice!   Sorry to make this so long, but I really like him. You know those hockey players :D   And one last thing... my best friends boyfriend happens to be friends with my crush... just in case that would help in your answer. lol

20090128152932AAitPm0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he acting like this?	Myself and my boyfriend of a year and a half broke up just before Christmas. It was a strange break up. We both still love each other. And in all honesty, I don't even know how we got to this point. He wanted us to be friends straight away and that wasn't something I was able to do. He messed with my head a lot over the weeks, ringing me and saying he loved me etc. But the thing is that he was the one who ended it. Now he's just not talking to me and doing stupid stuff like changing his personal message on MSN a lot, obviously just for my benefit. He either says that he can't sleep or something like that. Or that he's going to get really really drunk. I can't figure out if he's loving being free of me, or if he's drowning his sorrows. And now he's just ignoring me any time that I have attempted to talk to him.       Anyone got any suggestions as to why he's being like this? Friends have told me they think he's just really confused. Has anyone got other ideas?      Thanks!   <3      PS: I have to admit that if he said he wanted me back, I'd be with him in a heartbeat. But I'm not really even allowing myself to hope for that...
20090128153950AANnDst	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused about this guy.  Why does he look at me?  What should I do?	A few years ago, I attended a performance driving school. I was only 20 years old and I started to have a crush on an instructor. I tried really hard not to let it show afterall, he was 32 yrs old. He didn't make it easy on me either. I'm pretty sure he had a thing for me as well. He would wink at me and make comments such as, "Let me hold you so that the wind doesn't blow you away." Or say "I could make you scream in other ways."      Since I attended the school I have seen him on and off. I can't look at him or talk to him because there is still an attraction. I am embarassed. Each time I see him it's awkward and he picks up on it. He walked by me one day and said "She didn't even look at me!" Another time I saw him at a resturaunt with a friend and he walked up to me, got close and looked me in the eye. The minute he sat down I heard his friend say, "Is that the girl you always talk about?" I don't know what to do. The last time I saw him I didn't even know it was him. He was standing in front of me looking at me and I was looking at him thinking "Oh this guy must know me because he can't take his eyes off me. Who is he?" I mean, he stared at me for a good long time while he poured out his water.      What should I do when I see him? Does he like me? I mean, I would go for him if there wasn't a 12yr age gap but there is.

20090128162037AAa3XEN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do? Help!!!!?	okay, i will try to make a long story short.    i dated this amazing guy for 6months to a year.   and i thought that he didn;t like me anymore because he always talked about this other girl (who ended up becomming my best friend.) so i broke up with him even though i liked him A LOT. and for a couple months i was a wreck and i thought i was over him, and then i started to like his best friend. his best friend asked me out and i said yes. i didn;t even think about how this would affect my ex. turns out that my ex still loved me months later and was not over me. my boyfriend broke up with me because he cheated on me. we dated for about 3 weeks. and i think i really hurt my first ex and i relized that im still not over him. and the girl that he always used to talk about (the one who became my BFF) says that he still likes me and so does some of his other friends. i do not like my ex that cheated on me at all. but i really do like my first ex and i feel bad if i hurt him and im not at all over him.      What should i do? i cant tell him that my BFF told me that he still likes me. and i don;t know if i should go back out with him or not. if i did i would feel slutty going between best friends like that.my first ex acts like he still likes me sometimes, like calling me about homework, texting me. making eye contact with me during class, staring at me, etc.      i reallyyyy do need help on this one.   thanks for any acvice.

20090128172023AAeu1mv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I a mean person, or is it all in my head?	I have been getting pretty outgoing for the last couple months, and have gone from a super-shy girl to a pretty outgoing one. I feel as though when I became more outgoing, I became more mean. No one has been telling me this, and i've even asked a couple good friends and they said no, your really nice. Yet, I still can't stop feeling bad after school, and i don't even know why. There is just this thought deep inside my head that I am becoming a mean person, which I completly do not want to be. I've tried thinking what I've done, but I usually can't think of anything. I just feel like personality is getting meaner and different, and I don't know how to change that.  Do you think I am probably meaner, or is it just all in my head? Please give me the honest answer, I just really want to know.

Here's 8 examples of what I'm talking about...      1.When a female looks into your eyes longer and intently.   2.Blow air kisses at you when she leaves out of the room.   3.Walk w/ more sway using her hips.   4.Wears a bit more perfume than usual, because at one u complimented how great it smell, and she wore it again this time a bit more.   5.Plays w/ her long hair more in front of you.   6.Periodically licks her lips during conversations w/ you.   7.Sucks on some hard candy like a jolly rancher.   8. During a drink w/ her circles the top of her glass

20090225153920AAB73kN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How should I make this up to my husband?	My husband bought a new car today. We've been waiting for an old Maxima to finally crap out and it finally did so I told him to buy whatever he wanted. Last night he had looked at a BMW, some Acura, and an Infinity.       He calls me today and says I need to come by and sign the title to the old Maxima (it's in my name) and he's at the *gasp* Mitsubishi dealer. So I go over there and he has purchased this thing called a Lancer. He asks me what I think and before I could stop myself, I said,    "You did not buy that car did you? It's hideous!"    His face fell - he bought that car. It's apparently fast or something. I think it's the ugliest thing I've ever seen but it doesn't matter because it's not my car and I realize that. I have my own car.      So, this is what I've done and my question is - when he comes home, other than telling him I actually like the car (a lie, but a best interest lie) what should I say or do to make him feel better about this? Should I apologize or should I just focus on the positives from here on out? I know he's got to be feeling hurt about what I said.
20090225153701AAq1Gbp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Boyfriend Is Ignoring Me ; Please Help?	My boyfriend is mad at me for a little issue, he doesn't want to talk about it (very unsual of him - he usually likes to talk things out with me, and wants to communicate). He has been ignoring my calls for a few days now. Usually whenever he ignores me it's no more than a few hours to 2 days. I think he might be high --- If he is, he is prolly taking cocaine. Whenever he gets depressed he usually resorts to drugs. He was really upset even before our arguement.      He was acting very strange online a few days ago, not really himself, however, he did say he would call me later and talk to me "someday" He also kept saying "nevah" to anything I was saying (even if it didn't make sense) and I asked him if he was high. He only said "o_o no....i'm a robot." Last time he was on drugs, he didn't tell me about it because he knows I would try and stop him because if I did stop him he would've went through withdrawal & he didn't want me to worry about him. All the other times before that, he came to me, and I talked him out of it. Do you think he was high...or do you think he was just messing with me since he's mad at me?      But I can't tell if he's on drugs or not, because he ignores my calls. Yesterday, he ignored me online. I'm really scared he didn't answer because he was so high that he couldn't type. Should I go visit his house tomorrow or Friday (when his parents might be out)?      *by the way, he does NOT have a house phone and i can't text him & his dad doesn't like girls coming over the house, which might piss off my boyfriend, for making his dad angry.
20090128195319AAHGxb2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Being Single sucks...please help?	ok, Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm a 20 year old college kid and I live in New Jersey. I have a handicap known as spastic cerebral palsy. I say its small cause lucky for me it only affected my walking and balance. Anyway I wasn't the most popular guy in school do to my handicap and when I finally got interested in girls they would always turn me down, I'm guessing because of my handicap or the fact that I had pretty bad acne. It all started in eighth grade and followed me all through high school. The acne went away thank god. However, because every girl I would ask out turned me down I guess you could say I shut down and gained a fear. Now whenever I see a girl that I find attractive I'll smile and be friendly but I can never gain enough courage to ask her out. I am a freshmen in college. In my senior year of high school I liked a girl and she liked me but yet again my fear took over and I never asked her out. However, she asked me out and thats how we started dating. Here I ran into another problem, since I never had many girlfriends when I finally got one I sucked at many things. Such as knowing when to make out with her and things and the few times we tried to make out I sucked at that to do to my lack of experience. Needless to say she dumped me two months later. Now that I am 20 not only am I afraid to ask women out, I'm afraid if she says yes she will get bored with me and dump me again because I have no clue when I'm doing when it comes to being sexual with a woman. I'm still a virgin also. If it ever did get as far as sex, I might know what to do because I've watched a lot of porn. lol. Anyway, is there anything that can help me or am I stuck being a single 20 year old who comforts his loses by listening to punk and heavy metal all the time and playing guitar?

20090128200159AAf5xS7	Family & Relationships;Friends	I cant get over this friend?	so last year me and this girl became friends...we went to different schools  but our parents worked together and we played each other in basketball. so we started talking on facebook a lot...then one day she got my number from a mutual friend and started texting me. we would text for like the whole day throughout school and then into the evening.  we got along so well and had a lot in common. we would vent to eachother about things we couldnt talk about with people from our own school. at the time i wasnt happy with my current friend situation at my own school, so this friendship began meaning a lot to me, because it seemed like this would develop into a true friendship because we got along so well and never ran out of things to talk about. so one day we decided to hang out and she invited me over to her house. from that day on things would never be the same again, as i left her house that day, i knew we wouldnt talk that much anymore. for starters im very shy when im first meeting people, i can text or IM someone and be fine, but then once im with them in person for the first time im very quiet and can never think of things to say. those who have known me for 10 years know this, but i guess this caught her off guard. also her bff was with us, who i had never met, so that was awkward and i sometimes felt out of place cause they were so close. so from that day on she stopped returning my texts and eventually we didnt talk at all. a few weeks ago i also discovered that she had deleted me as a friend on facebook and myspace! like was that really necessary? it wasnt like i had tried to contact her or was bothering her. this really hurt me. we also happened to have the same favorite song, and its a sad song, and i cant even stand to listen to it anymore because my eyes start to water. what the hell happened? im so hurt and this is really affecting me with new friendships ive tried to form since then, like i get really scared that theyre gonna desert me too. i also have to see her when our teams play eachother which is going to be weird. ive considered confronting her but i dont think it would get me anywhere and i would just embarrass myself. =[

20090128185642AA095W1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think of this paper i can to do for class ?	I had to do a paper for social studies class so i posted 2 questions on yahoo to see what responses i'd get       Question 1   Do you think a woman should go out to the bars without her husband?      Question 2   I described a siutation in where a husband wouldnt allow a wife to out to the bars on a girls night out"      most responses to question 1 were   "no a wife shouldn't go out without a husband"..that "its disrespectful"...and that " bars aren't for married people"      most reponses to question 2 were   wife needs to stand up for herself and not allow the husband to tell her what to do      I myself liked the answers to number 2 questions      as for number 1   I am married and sometimes myself and my husband go out seperately....mostly we go out together...but thank god we trust one another enough to go out seperately if the occasion occurs.

20090128193916AAg8pWP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend emotionally abusing me (SHORTER VERSION)?	We have been together for around 8 months. he's 25. Im 18.   He used to be really nice and romantic and I was always missing him.   The past four months he has gotten worse and worse by the month.   He complained about how I dressed/did my hair etc and I changed that for him and he seems fine with that now...   I have been paying for almost everything lately and last week he bought Costco sushi and brought it home for me and his sister and him to eat...then he suddenly freaked out at us and was like, "I pay for everything!" and his sister walked off and I was just silent and then he he was like, "you don't even know how to eat right!"    A few weeks before that we were laying in bed after watching a movie (he stopped going to movie theaters with me too) and afterwards I was nice and like, "wow. scary, right?" and he suddenly freaked out at me for getting to close to him when I sleep and for things he always said he LIKED before (such as me lying on top of him for fun..he used to smile) He screamed"your knees hurt!"...but he never told me that before...and he was yelling at me for stuff like when he dropped me off at 7-11 to buy a juice and was illegally parking(no clue why)..but I saw him pull his car out when I went in so I thought he was reparking since there were a ton of empty spots and then I bought him candies as a surprise and while in line to pay, my bf ran into the store and screamed at me to hurry up to the point that the guy in front of me had me go ahead of him....then afterwards he yelled at me that he was in illegal parking and that I was slow/stupid etc.(although I was trying to be nice to him by buying him the candies...)   He always asks me to give him bjs/massages...and after i start he says, "I didnt make you do this"    When he makes me cry he tells me, "stop crying or you'll have more wrinkles!" (i'm 18 and have creased EYELIDS...not wrinkles...he's chinese so he hardly has creases in his eyelids).   I'm always scared that I'll make him mad now...   He always tells me stuff like, "You're so annoying! You're just like your mom! You're always like this! Stop crying!"   When I feel pretty/happy he'll touch my pimples (I'm still not grown out of them yet) and be like, "I didn't SAY anything."   and his compliments (except on occasion) tend to be like, "wow. you're so beautiful! What did you put on your face?" :(   Anyways...I'm just wondering if this is considered an emotionally abusive relationship...   Thanks^^

He will stare at me all the time.   -He can find me in a crowed hallway easily and looks at me   -He somehow ends up next to me when we pass in the hall.   -He looks at me when i walk off the bus   -He looks at me at our lockers sometimes   -Watches me walk into the cafeteria sometimes.      But then 2 weeks ago on Wednesday he watched me go to my gym line and my friend frank came up and asked if i wanted to play ping pong and i said sure and then he said something funny so i laughed. And my crushed didn't look at me all that much until the next week because in gym i saw him look at me from a far and in gym we were doing a dance unit and he kept glancing at me. So then this week approaches he looks at me in gym and in the hallway yesterday..i was in the cafeteria and he walked by and he knew i was in there so he looked at me from the hall...and when i passed by him and he looked at me until he couldn't see me. But today he glances at me once in gym and maybe at our lockers. So whats going on...i dont understand him. Do guys look at a girl a lot somedays but others not so much so it doesn't seem obvious. Please Please Help Me!      Yes i have talked to him before. We used to talk a little on aim and in school.

Ive been texting this girl for almost a month now. we know what each other look like cause we send pics. Shes a year older than me.

20090128193535AAIjRKq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I just caught my dad masturbating. What do I do?	IT WAS SO AWKWARD. I went out in the living room to ask him a question and he didn't even try to play it off. How do I forget what just happened before I puke myself into a coma and die?
20090128190057AAFcpCg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats wrong with a girl who...?	guys don't seem to like me, either they are too scared to talk to me or they think I'm so weird and gross.      I'm a sporty girly kind of girl.   I care about appearances and everything but I'm not so vague that I look in the mirror every two seconds. I care about my skin, my health, occasionally my weight (only if I have to though) and my hair. I wear makeup but only for occasions.      I'm muscular and flex able, strange combination I know, but i am. I'm a base in competitive cheerleading, bu I have all the skills it takes to be a flyer, however i'm not one because i am too heavy. I am average, not too skinny, I am NOT heavy set. and I am muscular not to a degree to where I have veins popping out of my arms but just like most of my muscles are in my legs, so if I were wearing a bikini or shorts and I were to flex my legs you would see it.      I'm a easy going girl, since I do cheer i don't have much time on my hands so every moment I get with a guy that likes me and I think hes a decent guy to I try to savor it. I'm not a girl who's is good with guys. I'm a girl who's comfortable with them. If the subject "go out" comes up and I want to say it I choke, but it I say hang out its fine. IDK why I'm just that way. I have plenty y of guy friends, but they are all popular and they would never go out with me because I'm not popular.       AT MY SCHOOL IF YOUR NOT RICH OR POPULAR YOUR NOT DATABLE that's practically a rule for the guys.   I'm kinda smart, I like science and math although  they aren't my strongest. I am on the B honor roll and that's good considering I don't have that much time.      here are some pictures of me.   FYI: I have naturally wavy hair but I usually style it, rarely curl it, mostly flat iron it but sometimes I do here are some pics of me with both.      body pic     http://s189.photobucket.com/albums/z298/...    BTW that's called a scorpion is a flyer cheer move^      curly hair    http://s189.photobucket.com/albums/z298/...       straight hair    http://s189.photobucket.com/albums/z298/...       they might not be the best pictures but it give an idea of what I look like.      so my questions are       whats wrong with me?   Why don't guys like me?   Do I seem date-able or even like-able?

20090128211113AAIHDfI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please help me save my children from the dirty country of england?	THE UK GOVERNMENT KILLED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN WITH OUT ANY REMORSE?   i am a US citizen. My ex wife is British citizen. I have two children. Several years ago, my ex wife's father passed away in the UK, and SHE WENT TO THE UK to mourn her father's death. She went back with my children with a return plane ticket for her and my children. My ex-wife stayed in the UK for over a year, and I thought she would come back to the USA. She did not and instead filed for divorce in the UK and got remarried. Her plan was to leave me for her boyfriend back in the UK when her father passed away because our marriage was an arranged marriage. I went through the USA children's affair and got legal representative . My ex wife would battle me with everything and she would do everything to prevent me from seeing my children. Las summer, the judge said there may be a possibility that the children can come to the United States to only visit, but my ex wife was adament against that. She got a cascaff involved in the case. The official UK male bashing organization against men. After battle the UK courts for 5 years, the UK judge rendered an order stating that I can never see my children again and I can not speak with them over the phone. He also said I can not appeal this decision. The basis of this decision is that the mother has manipulated my children to tell a UK CAFCASS social worker that they never want to see me again, and the judge complied with this. My son is 10 years old and my daughter is 7 years old. My ex wife married a fundamental muslim who is brainwashing my children, the UK courts just relinquished my of all human fundalmental rights as a father, and I feel my country the United States has betrayed me and has not done enough.      I pleas need help and I am in immense grieving pain. I feel as though the UK courts told me to think of my children as being dead because they wont let me call my children.       I never did anything to hurt my children and prior to this I had visited them several times through a court order and I was extra gentle and kind with my children , so this social report is fabricated with lies and deceit.      I need help from any American's that can help me bring back two American citizen children back home and unit them to there very sad father.      I am deeply hurting that I have not been able to get out of bed the last 48 hours. I am feeling really depressed , betrayed, hurt, and lied to. I do not know what to do and how can a judge do such a thing.      I m going to post this everyday until someone can help me...Ive called the media, an attorney, the district attorney's office, and left a message with my congress man. I am not giving up and I hope maybe someone reading this will give me good advice to get my children back      TO ALL WOMEN THAT HATE MEN OR SOMEHOW RELATE THIS STORY TO WHAT EVER EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT PROMPTS YOU TO LEAVE VERY HURTFUL AND NEGATIVE POSTS....I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE NEVER TO TAKE AWAY MY CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHER..MY INTENTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN..I STILL STAND BY THIS... BUT THE EX WIFE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFE AND WILL LIE AND DECIET ABOUT EVERYTHING...SHE IS TELLING MY CHILDREN THAT I AM NOT THE FATHER AND HER NEW HUSBAND IS THE FATHER....I JUST WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY ON MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY...MY CHILDREN ARE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN TO MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER IS LOSING HIS SIGHT AND I JUST WANT HIS TO SEE HIS GRANDCHILDREN BEFORE HE LOSES HIS SIGHT...      PLEASE ..I NEED HELP...AND FYI..I NEVER HIT MY EX WIFE OR DID ANYTHING ELSE...SHE LEFT ON HER OWN ACCORD...   16 minutes ago - 3 days left to answer.    Additional Details   0 seconds ago      I never hit my children...during the last 5 years that i visited my kids in the Uk ...we were starting to develop a relationship and i felt to ask the evil UK courts if my children can come to the united states to visit me....the judge orginally agreed with it...Remind you this happen last summer in 2008..I left and returned back to the USA ....while back home , my ex wife got a social worker involved and the social worker interviewed my children and submitted a report to the judge that stated my children hated me and hated the united states, the children were scared of me and did not want to see me any more....      i was shocked because when i left in the summer, my children were said i was leaving..      what happen my ex brainwashed my children to say that stuff to the social worker and she wrote it..and the social worker recommended that i never see the kids again...the judge agreed with the social worker and thus giving me a death sentence of never to never see my kids again

20090128191853AA41cd0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Wow advice please?. What to do... so confused.?	well there is this guy name Juan I'm kind of good friends with and it turns out that hes been liking me for a while as more then just a friend. And he ended up telling me and it seriously seems like hes in love with me.. no not in love more like a stalker! he would call me 24/7 and come to my house at random times but now he just calls me everyday and now im just really confused because at first i dint like him like that But i told Juan that i kind of like him but when his friends asked me I would say idk or no or sumthin. But i wasn't leading him on because he was gonna ask out this girl name Audrey that he use to like.      And he told me that he dosen't like her at all and that he reallyyy likes me but he has to ask her out because he told all her friends (which are his friends too) that he would. But then on Saturday Juan told me that he dint ask her out because he really likes me and that he can't. And So I started to like Juan a LITTLE bit because it made me realized how much he likes me. But I told him before that I wouldn't want to be going out with anyone (but thats because i dint like him then)      But then his friend Kevin told me today that Juan is going out with Audrey and Juan asked me if I would say yes if he asked me out in a month or 2 and i said sure and that i would probably say yes. But now i guess hes going out with aurdrey and i kind of want to say something to him but idk if i should. And I thought that was really messed up because he would call me a lot and once i called him he would say that he would call me back later and that he has to go.. but wat i think is that he was on the phone with audrey or something.      So idk advice please.. confusing situtation and he even cried on my shoulder before which made me feel really bad because his friends told him that i dint like him but i told him that I do. So he thinks i like him but i guess hes going out with Audrey and idk wat to do anymore.. I want to just ignore him but i cant do that. so help pleasee..?

20090128185932AAw7rnh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crush on older co-worker (part 3)?	OK, so tonight went as planned. I have this co-worker/supervisor that I have had this crush on for sometime. Today we had to go to court to tesify on a lawsuit for the company. Afterwards, I suggested and he agreed to take me to Outback for dinner and a few drinks. I learned a lot about his past and present by letting him open up to me. I really like this guy. Anyway, after dinner he drove us to the office where we retrieved our cars and went home our separate ways. He asked if he should call to confirm I got home and I told he yes. He did and we talked for another half hour on the phone. He is twice my age (he 42, me 21). Anyway, I am going to see if I can manuever to get him to go to lunch with me tomorrow and or dinner again. What do you think about these older man younger woman type of relationships? Can it work? Have you any expertise on this?

20090128191822AAnlPnY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do about weird people?	I've got this really fat, annoying biddy following me wherever I go. No matter how hard I try to ignore her, she never gets the hint. After two weeks of her stalking me, I've already managed to move up on her Myspace profile as her number two and she's already sent me a message stating she loves me. Thankfully, I was able to evade her birthday party after she rescheduled it at least three times for me. Now, she's having a second "surprise" birthday that she wants me to go to, surprise? WhatthefuckdoIdo. I don't want to hurt her feelings, I want to completely destroy them and any chances of them growing back. What would be the most effective method?

20090128205736AAdnGiq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is there such thing as healthy competition when it comes to friends?	For those who just want to answer the question, I suggest you skip everything that follows this, for it is very long -- but I really don't want you to, because I need help!      ______________________________      Me and my friend, (for now lets refer to him as) R, have been tight for as long as I can remember... kind of before cliques were even created. Anyway, just recently I've realized that our relationship is really... "complex."      We came out of the closet (yes, he and I are gay) at about the same time, and it was probably one of the hardest things I've had to endure; I think it was a lot faster for me. I'm one of those people that doesn't need to know whether you love me or not, because someday I know I will be loved, I fight for what I believe in (very opinionated), and I don't take bullcrap. But R is a lot more sensitive than I ever will (or want) to be.      I remember a conversation we had freshman year (we're sophomores, tenth grade, now); he had just told his mom -- I told my "guardian" the week before -- about being gay. She was like "no. you're not. you have time to change. i won't tell your dad cause he'll go ******* ballistic, but still... God will one day forgive you, but only if you ask for it."      My experience was just as hard, but like I said before, I don't like feeling like a prisoner of my own emotions, so masking it wasn't very hard. R, on the other hand, was freaking out about his mom's reaction. He was all like, "oh my god. what if she pulls me out of school, and ships me off to some christian-led, private school?" and then to "i don't want to run away, but i think i have to!"      Anyway... back to the conflict.   Lately, he's been trying to be very "competitive" with me. His mother has gotten over his gay preferences (she tries to mention it as little as possible, but when she does... she gives him the same lecture, and he always comes crying back to me, telling me about it). And R's dad still doesn't know.      So let's rewind a little bit -- I came out first, technically; I lost my virginity first (though I'm not proud of that at all); I acted as if people were a lot more accepting about me. R said he feels alienated from his friends and family sometimes (he TOLD me this before). I don't want to assume he's jealous, but what else am I to think.       The way he lost his virginity was giving this random guy he met at a restaurant head -- on a vacation with his family. I told him "what the ***** were you thinking?!? do you know what kind of CRAP he could've carried?!?!" His reply was, "I dont care! You did the same thing!"      What I did wasn't the same. My guy I knew... but obviously not well enough because it ended. After our little session, the guy told me about his girlfriend, and how I shouldn't tell anybody. (can you believe that guy?!? he had a gf yet found time to do me! but that's beside the point.)         So after his attempt at being just as "wanted" as me, R went on to different things. His next endeavor was with some guy he met online! We're 15 and the guy is about... 31. I was like "hello!!! every heard of statutory rape?!?" He was like: "sometimes, I just like to cheer guys up. You have no idea what it's like to be sad and depressed." Isn't that stupid?      I personally think I'm a lot more "appealing" than R, but that's just my opinion -- and I kind of think about myself like that to everyone. Last year I got the lead tenor role in one of our choir's songs... and this year, he was more than happy to know that he was accepted into Honorary Choir (I didn't try out, so I was like whatev about it).      This back-and-forth tiffs are really getting out of hand, imo. Just the other day I saw two slices on his arm. When I asked him what it was about, he was like "shuttup! god, you're so annoyingly nosy sometimes."      Today I went mega-bitchh on him. He cried, said the usual crap, and then stormed off. But today it felt official... cause he said this to me for the first time, "I'm sorry everyone isn't living the fairytale life like you, K."      I was like wowed. Mad and frustrated too. Friends have told me to forgive him, but I honestly don't want to. If I was to forgive him, I know things would go back to the same competitive things.      Oh, and I've been crushing (really minor, but still there) on the same guy for a while now. R knows it. But this guy has a gf already -- but rumor is he's bi so no limits means more fun. Lol. R is always telling me about "this guy," and how "this guy" asks R to give him head in the lockerroom. R said he's probably just joking, but I know he's doing this purposely to make me feel bad. What do I do about him?               Oh, and I did something to R in the past that kind of makes him bitter towards me... but we forgave and forgot so it's kind of the past already. And I won't say what I did because people will judge me. :\         K... answer and star please! I'm in desperate need of answers!

20090225154142AAmwqcy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this weird guy like me? How do I get rid of him?	I don't like him. At all. He's a junior and I'm a sophomore, but we're in one of the same classes. He sits in front of me, and always leans back so far when he stretches that his head almost rests on my desk. lol, he's weird.. Also when he casually looks around the classroom, he looks at me in the end. He laughs super hard at every joke I tell, even if it's not THAT funny. :\ He kind of gives me the creeps. Today he said something to me about how of course, I must be in love with his "sensitive blue eyes". I was like "Oh, of course!" sarcastically. But anyway..How do I give him the idea that I don't like him, but in a subtle way? Like with expression, gestures, etc. I think he thinks I'm into him for some reason. Thanks.

20090128185111AA22vsY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend delema. Does he not trust me?	We've been dating for 6 months. We live about an hour drive apart. He asked me today if for his band's concert on Saturday if I'd pick up his 3 friends before the show and drive them back home after. This would cause me to drive an hour to that city and then drive an hour downtown--instead of just drive downtown from where I live. Now, for my boyfriend..I would do that...however, my mom is coming to the show, and his friends are going to be drunk and stoned in the car...so it wouldn't be a good idea.       so INSTEADDD, I suggested that since I'm going to his house on Friday to hang out, that he can put all his band gear inside my car and I'll drive it to the show on Saturday and even get there early so he can set up. This way, he would have room in his car to drive his friends to the show.       However, when I suggested it...he said it was a dumb idea. He said "No, I don't want you to drive my stuff" and I said why? and he said "it's too big and I don't want you to, its expensive stuff" and I said, "it's not like I'm going to ruin it". And he said "I know you wont, I just don't want you to". So I left it at that..didn't push that idea on him anymore, even though I thought it was a PERFECT solution.       The way he said "it's expensive stuff" makes me feel like he wouldn't trust me with his equiptment..and it makes me feel like crap. Does anybody understand where he's coming from? If so, please enlighten me! If not, please let me know if I should tell him how I feel or something!!

I of course looked at her and he looked at me and smiled, and I smiled too, without even knowing. The smile gave me butterflies and made me happy, which makes me think she is interested because a regular smile would not have made me go crazy because I love a girl that smiles. But a couple days earlier, she was walking towards me but she had her head looking the other direction when I was looking at her. What does that mean? Is she interested? Thanks!    PS. Shes a very pretty girl, which makes me think she would never go after a guy like me.

She stares at me during class sometimes and quickly looks away when I look over. The problem is that now that she has been unable to go out with me two times because of other plans, I feel it is hard to talk with her now. I don't know what to say, and she wont talk to me because she fells too nervous and shy. What should I do??

It may sound kinda perverted but i've studied alot of porns, and learn alot of sexual moves and positions to get into with a female. As well as getting high adrenaline and agression with that animal like lust of getting down in the sheets.      Am i just fooling myself with my curiousity? or could i REALLY make a girl scream in pleasure?
20090128182558AA2ySN3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would she do this?	My brother and his former girlfriend dated for 2 and a half years and I always thought of them as perfect for each other and they loved each other so much and they always got along and when they got in an argument they made up so well. Everyone including my brother always said he could never picture them breaking up but recently after new years he found out that she cheated on him with another dude whos asian and overweight and not attractive when my brother is the opposite of all those and she told him about it and after she told him she said she always thought they would get married and have kids together, etc. Why would she cheat on him in this situation? I just can't grasp it in my mind.
20090128203726AABvslx	Family & Relationships;Family	Is my brother overreacting about this?	My brother doesn't like boyfriend (he's 17 and im 14 my brother's age) because he gets drunk at a parties and he smokes. Also he shoplifts, he even has a criminal record for it. But I could careless about it. My parents even ban me to see him because I came home drunk, But that still doesn't stop me.

20090128200035AAhpbDv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Slept with another guy while dating a married man?	I slept with another man while I was "kind of" dating a married man. I love this married man more than anything but it was so hard being the "other" women even though he told me he was getting a divorce. Living in secrecy and having to lie to all my friends in town was even harder. The day I told him I slept with this other guy, he told me him and his wife were going to sign papers. He told me he told his parents he was still seeing me and we were going to get together where he was staying for a while. (He went away to see his friend that was dying of cancer for 2 months). Right before he left, he was reading thru my cell phone and read some texts to a guy that I he knows i think is hot. He got mad. I told him nothing was going to happen but it did. It was premeditated but I knew this guy was going to be out that night. The sex meant nothing and I felt guilty the whole time. I have the guiltiest feeling inside. I know in my heart I betrayed him and his trust but he was killing me. I want to know how I could even think about getting close to another guy if I love this other one so much. The married man told me we can still be friends but he doesn't trust me anymore and probably never will. I came out and told him and didn't try to hide it. Asked him for forgiveness. But he doesn't beleive me it will never happen again. Another part of this is he tells me he cant have a relationship or comitt to me but doesn't want me to see anyone else. I dont want to see anyone else. I want him. He says he's comitted to his love for me and he wont see anyone else. I guess the question I'm asking is was the ending my fault? I know it was wrong to sleep with another guy and I honestly don't know why I did it. Ya I think the guy is hot but I have no feelings for him. I haven;t spoke to him since and I feel really bad about that to. Any advise will help...Oh also, I left me marriage of 6 years and two kids to be with this man....

I am in a relationship with a turkish guy who's father's parents are cousins. FIRST cousins. And I caught his dad kissing him a few times. Lately he has been missing his dad (we are in the same house)   He talks about him..weird like...you know when your missing a girl or something. He kind of glances off...and saids quotes from his dad. Only does the quotes when his dad goes to the store for like 45 minutes. i think he was with me to get even with him.

20090128192436AAXEfMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please just read it..?	This is really complicated,and I'm not sure what I want to do,or what I should do. So I need your help.      A few months ago,I dated a guy for a little while,and things were pretty good.He treated me well and I liked him.One weekend,his 16th bday weekend,I went out with him and his best friend after his bday party.I found out that he wanted to meet up with some people and they were gonna smoke some weed.When I said no to it,at first he got mad,and then he tried to makeup some story about how he wasn't going to do it in the first place.I told him to take me home right then.Everything else in our relationship was good,except that.But it all just kind of blew my mind and I broke up with him a few days later.   Wait it gets more complex...   The day before I broke up with him,I hung out with my ex(whom I've dated 4 times) I've always had a thing for him,I really think that he was my first love. But we hung out that night,and I talked to him about what I was thinking and what I was going through.We just had a moment and we kissed. After I broke up with my bf,I ended up getting back with my ex.It didn't last very long and I realized that I was an idiot for going back to him.But I can finally let go of our past relationships instead of dwelling on them.   My ex's best friend(the ex thats 16) talked to me tonight. And talked about how much my ex missed me and that he threw the weed out b/c he felt so bad. He said that we should start to talk again.Me and my ex's friend are really close,like brother sister close so i dont think he would make this up. In a way I want to,but idk if i should just wait and start fresh with a new guy,or talk to my ex. We had a good thing going,but idk if it would be the best thing to do,or if it would be too weird.

20090128191459AATPM2S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or not?!?!?!?!?	Okay, so there's this boy (Smokey)....      I've had a huge crush on Smokey since like October and he has recently become available.  We graduated high school together, but we've talked more in the last 24 hours than we have in all 4 years of high school, I'd say he's one of my best friends now.  In October I started flirting with Smokey to make our other friend jealous, and it back-fired - now I really do like Smokey.      Smokey has been going through a pretty rough break-up, and I've kind of been his go-to-girl for advice.  The relationship is officially over, but I think he is still in love with her.  He doesn't talk about her too much anymore, but he is still having problems, I think he's realized that they're not getting back together though.      Since Christmas he has been very flirtatious (we've never even hugged, although his guy best friends hug me all the time).  He claims that the anti-depressants he's on makes him aroused (definitely not that teenage boy syndrome, right?).  He texts me in the mornings "Morning Sunshine", he placed our class schedules so that we'd be together more often, he's always inviting me to hang out with him (but his friends tend to think that's an invite for them as well, which he apologizes for it not being just an "us" thing), he brings me gifts, and I haven't gone a day without talking to him since his break up.      But on top of all of that, he acts like he doesn't like me...  He asks me which of my sorority sisters is the hottest, and which one does he have the best chance of sleeping with.  He straight up checks out other girls right in front of me.  He tells me about how hot the chick from Paramore is, and he finds it funny to tell me about how great sex is (I'm waiting until I'm married for that).      So basically what I'm asking is - Does he like me?  I think some of the stuff that he does points to a yes, but then something will happen that points to no.  We're opposite in ways (I'm Catholic, he's atheist; I'm kinda loud, he's very shy), but then we're alike (we both are going into the medical field, we both are very smart people, we both enjoy traveling, art, literature, and an occasional sunset).      Given that information, do you think I have a shot (if so, what's his deal???), or am I just wasting my time?
20090225154253AAQg4EN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I might have messed up! How do I tell him I changed my mind?	So this SUPER popular guy and I were texting and talking. Yes, we were friends and stuff and we had a class together last semester. He is a senior and I am a freshmen. Well he asked me to do somethings and I automatically said NO! We got one thing clear that he will not just sit here and use me for his pleasures. So we are friends now and he will not get those things from me. So everything I said no to. Well, come to think of it now maybe I do want some of those things?! How can I tell him without being weird. But he is going to have to work his way up, he is just not going to get it. Help please?

I was nice to him and talked to him on facebook (he's shy and won't talk much in person) but one day in class he freaked out and threw a backpack full of textbooks at this girl. so i'm sort of afraid of what he might do if he gets angry. and he asked for my number and there was no way i could say no. and now hes talking to me all the time. and he told me that he talks to his friends about me everyday. and its starting to sound like he doesn't think we're just friends. i don't want to hurt his feelings. and i don't want to lead him on. i just don't know what to do!
20090128200334AAm7Kyz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend says he's single on myspace. Would this bother you?	So, two weeks ago, my boyfriend of 5 years asked me to make him a myspace page so he could check out pages of people he went to school with and relatives that he fell out of contact with. I did it for him and marked his status as In A Relationship.       I looked at his page today and he has taken me out of his top friends and changed his status to Single!      I was furious! I confronted him and told him that it was disrespectful for him to put that. He disagreed and refused to change it back. He tells me I'm just being dramatic and trying to pick a fight and that it's "just myspace". Even though we are not married, we are definitely in a relationship. We do live together and have for 4 years.      This really bothers me. I'm curious to know how others would feel if their boyfriend/girlfriends did this,      Thanks

20090128194614AAedG1S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with my boyfriend? UGH?	Hi my name is Rachel. You may know me if you go to my school which is Lexington High. I am the senior class president by the way.      What i came here to ask you is this. My boyfriend has recently stopped giving me attention. I need a lot of attention or i feel really shitty and depressed. You would not understand how shitty my life would be without attention. I tell him to call me at least 5 times a day. As soon as he wakes up, 3 times during the day, and before he goes to bed. If he misses one I will get very upset and emotional and freak out.      This past week he has missed at least 5 calls. I think he is plotting to either leave me or is cheating on me behind my back. Am i right?      Share your experiences with me...I am lost and confused.

20090128195146AA9XXCs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to Get this Guy to Notice Me?	Okay, well here is the story:      There is this guy that I have liked for about 2 and a 1/2 months, and just found out that he recently broke up with his girlfriend. I am very shy around guys I like, so I can't bring myself to talk to him. I have talked to him once or twice, but I have no idea how I did it. One time, my friend started the conversation with him and I kinda just joined in, and he smiled. That happened last week... haha I'm gonna describe it so you can see how I talked to him:      Taylor (My friend): Why are you wearing shorts in the middle of winter?   Guy I like (not mentioning his name for reasons...): Cuz I felt like it! Haha not really. I couldn't finish my laundry so I had to wear these. And they are not shorts, they are capris.   Taylor: They are shorts   Me: Why would you do that? Weren't you freezing outside?   Guy I like: No. In fact, I took a brisk walk in the park this morning.   Me: Hahahahahahahha!      Okay, so that is what happened lol.   Anyway, he is very popular and he flirts a lot (I know what you are thinking) and he is so hot and yeah... and its weird because I usually don't like those type of guys who are the emo type (style wise). And sometimes I dress kinda emo and sometimes I dress in pink girly stuff. It just depends on what I feel like, but nowadays I try to dress emo because I know he dresses like that and he hangs out with people who dress like that. Also, I try to talk loudly with my friends when he is near, but I sound retarded lol. Oh, and also after out p.e./health midterm, he kept staring in my direction. And I sit in the corner by the door. So I don't know if he was staring off into space or at the door or what. Haha I noticed him doing that because after I finished my midterm I looked at him and he scared me because he was just staring... and I kept looking back for like 5 minutes and he was still staring... but then he stopped.      So yeah, I kinda go a little off topic...   Anyway, any conversation starters, or tips to get him to notice me or talk to me?   I would like boys and girls to answer, please and thank you!      Some useful info:   I heard he is a drummer in a band.   He likes this band called "Mayday Parade"   He hates Nick Jonas (I love Nick Jonas, but I don't say it in front of the guy I like because I'm scared he won't like me or something...) anyway he hates him because he looks like Nick Jonas and he doesn't want to...   So yeah...   Please help!

20090225153603AAMmFjR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I just being unrealistic over my husband's use of porn?	I am 23 weeks pregnant and totally hormonal, but husband's use of porn started long before I got pregnant.  He downloads porn almost everyday and masturbates to it at least 5 days out of 7.  He tells me that it is nothing against me, and that he knows it is an obsession, but he sometimes just needs it to release stress.  I go to bed alone most nights while he is in the other room with his whores.  I HATE it and he knows it.  Once in a while he will turn everything off and not go on the computer for a whole weekend for me.  We have talked about this and he says it will not be a part of our lives forever, but I don't see that ever happening.  It makes me feel horrible. I've told him that and he just insists that he loves me and looking at these women has nothing to do with love.  He says he is happy with our marriage, he just has a bad addiction like smoking.  What do I do to make it all stop, or is this something that all guys do and I should get over it?

20090128193645AAgNjTP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did I get dumped?	I'm 34 and I still don't get it. I'm smart, pretty and a lot of fun. Things went really well. We went out a few times, then I emailed him and he didn't reply, then I called and he sounded happy to hear from me, but I didn't hear from him for a few days, so I emailed him to find out why he hasn't called, but no reply.      I'm an Investigator in my career and I like closure. If someone (especially a 40 year old) tells me that it won't work out, that's fine...but this is ridiculous. Could it be because he is a recent divorcee, even though he initiated the divorce? Or am I just repulsive? Now I can't handle it since I don't have an answer and I want to start smoking again.

20090128205556AA6Fib1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	ADVICE?????????? PLZ HELP ME!?!?!?	I ignored a guys request three times to hang out because I wasn't sure of his behavior, if it was genuine.      On my Aim Status a few days ago I put: "Empty sentiments -- Do I look stupid?"      The next day he puts on his status: "I will never forget you, I can't."      I know it's not about any other female because he said that to me directly a few weeks ago. We've been friends for around several months.      His last girlfriend he lasted four days with. They broke up because he tried to kiss me and I told him not to do that because of the obvious reasons. He phoned to tell me personally he broke up with her.      Now that I feel I am ready to draw closer to him, he seems a bit distant. What gives?      I tried calling him last night but he didn't answer.           He lasted with his previous girlfriend for 8 days. They broke up because she kissed another guy. We never had sex, just made out a few times during the summer. We became good friends in the fall.
20090128213038AA0Q6Iz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sex, what to do... or not do.?	I want to have sex with my fiance'.  We are both 23 and have waited until now.  She expresses interest and so do I, but we never do it.  We are getting married in June, and we figure we have waited this long why not 5 more months.  At the same time, we are now living 800 miles apart and will only see each other twice before she comes back here for the wedding.  I will be seeing her for Valentines Day, and she says that she has some special plans.  I do not want to get my hopes up that this is what she has planned, but do you all think we should wait it out?  Is there a reason to break our commitment to abstain?      Additional thoughts:   We regularly have oral and manual (hands on) sex   We use toys on her    Phone sex occasionally       I share these ^ only to let you know that we have a very open line of communication and trust in our sexual lives.

I don't understand why I can't just let go of my marriage I don't even know him anymore, all I know is that every word out of his mouth is a lie! It is such a long story I am not even going to try to explain,but we are separated,I have been with him for the majority of the time for 17 yrs we have 3 teen sons,I am a recovering addict he I believe is still using I don't really know anything anymore,exept for the fact that I am so tired of fighting a losing battle.I defend him to everyone,even to myself.I am always trying to rationalize all of his actions although he has shown little to no responsibility our children or our marriage.I got clean and now he only pays attention to me when he wants sex,I got fed up tonight and told him I was tired of trying,he can't even be man enough to tell me the truth about anything anymore.Then I went in the house as he pulled out and although wanted to cry I have no tears left..He has always been my best friend,now he is just a stranger and an ***!So why do I not date?Why do am I still in love with him? His friends are always saying I am hot and he gets jealous,but yet he acts as if he could care less the rest of the time?What is my problem,I can't seem to break free,we have dated others in the past but kept running back to each other! And now when he looks at me he looks guilty as hell,I told him I thought he had slept with someone he played it off like I was crazy,why the hell can't he just man up and tell me the truth for once? I think have earned at least that! I am so pissed right now!!!

20090128182808AAMHlT7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't I get someone? ?	Ok, I know that this is incredibly pathetic of me to turn to the internet filled with total strangers that I don't even know with this question, but it's better than asking friends who might twist the truth. Strangers are more honest.       That aside, I'm just wondering why the hell I can't find an appropriate guy? I'm 15, and I think I'm kinda decent looking. I'm different, so maybe that's a turn- off. I dye my hair a lot (no crazy colors) and I have my own brand of fashion. I don't have a horrible personallity (I don't think....), I don't complicate things like a lot of girls, and I almost get along better with guys than I do girls!      here are a couple pictures       http://s698.photobucket.com/albums/vv341...        http://s698.photobucket.com/albums/vv341...       only my hair is shoulderlength, brown, and curly.      please help, because I want to figure out why my love life is pitiful.

Me and my best guy friend… We have always been close and physical contact isn’t odd between us. But what does it mean when all of the sudden we are spending afternoons curled up on his couch, his arm around me, my head on his shoulder, him playing with my hair, my clothes? Is this odd for best friends to do and just a need for human contact? Or are we pushing at something more here?

20090128185940AAMIICM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do with this guy?	So there's a guy in my life, a few years older by not much older. He's cute, romantic, and nice. But too nice. He texts me all day long to see if I'm okay and I'm happy, and If not he calls me crying. He says that he wont be happy until am, and he's so depressed when I seem sad. And when I tried talking to him about his dramatic tendencies, he cries and starts saying "I see death" over and over. I'm afraid to leave him (Even though I don't think we're officially dating) for fear of his life.   But on the other side of him, he's manipulative. When I don't feel like talking, he'll send me something like 'I'm in the hospital' and course, I respond, because that's just how I am. (He's not  in the hospital, he just says it to get my attention)      I really like him, and he's much more mature than the boys I go to school with. I just have no idea what to say to him.

20090128200246AAoFrrX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it fair for people to criticize me for changing my college major three times?	I was an honors student in high school and went to college on a partial scholarship. However, family problems and resulting financial crisis and later personal depression led me to drop out of college. I worked for two years and saved enough to go back. I enrolled in one program and then decided to switch to the one I'm in now. Anyhow, I am set to graduate this year (with little student loan debt, I should add). I am doing really well and I am confident I will enjoy working in this field for the rest of my working life.    Still, I've received verbal slappings - in a subtle way - from my parents' friends and some other people. They treat me as if I had committed some crime and constantly ask my mom why I'm behind in my life. Their kids are about my age (I'm in mid-20s) and some already have kids of their own and mortgages. My parents give me full emotional support since they see that I am dedicated to my studies.    Is it justifiable for other people to treat me like dirt because of the choices I made and which only affect my life?

20090128194831AAWkta0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend got me fired?  Guys and girls, need opinions?	I have been with my boyfriend four years, and he is a great boyfriend.  Anyway we are both in college, and working, "well Im not anymore".       I had a job at a restaurant as a waitress, I have been working about two months, mostly nights.  Anyway my manager was a complete jerk.  He would scream and cuss all of the waitresses and dishwashers, almost every day I worked.  Well one night, he was really being a jerk to me, and anyway I came home crying.  That pissed my boyfriend off, alot.  It happened 2 more nights in a row, and the next night my boyfriend showed up at my job.  When I saw him, I knew what was about to go down, so I tried to pull him to the side and say "don't do this Jay, it's not worth it", as I was trying to convince him not to do anything stupid, my manager started screaming at me saying "what the hell are you doing, you can **** on your own time".  My boyfriend then follows him into the kitchen, and beats the hell out of him, I mean beat his ***, not only in the kitchen, drug him out back and did it again.  Luckily the cops werent called, but I got fired, in exchange no charges get pressed.  And my old coworkers say that the manager hasnt been a jerk lately.      So girls what would you think of you boyfriend if he did this?      Guy what would you do if your girlfriend was in this position?
20090128182815AAoYSun	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Don't want to marry her, but want to stay together for a while...?	I currently do NOT plan to someday marry my girlfriend. Is it wrong to stay together for now?      Background:   A year ago, I did plan on marrying my girlfriend. We talked about the future/ weddings/ marriage/ kids, everything. She was into it too. Since then, things have changed.      We recently broke up (for 1 month) and got back together. But it wasn't an un-fixable problem. I realized that I still love her more than anyone else, ever.       The thing is... now, I think I wouldn't want to marry her. [I still want to get married someday, just not to her].       But I still want to be her boyfriend, in the meantime...       What are your opinions? Any experience with this? Suggested reading? I really do love her, so I don't want to do wrong by her.

20090128184210AAe7YD9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend looks at girls prettier than I am when I'm around him. But am I really wrong to be hurt by this?	Now I don't want to hear the stuff about guys will always look because some guys don't. And I myself, don't look at other guys in that way when I am around him. Honest truth. I don't care if he does while I'm not there. He's a man, I know that. I look when he isn't there too. So should I be upset? Should I dump him if this continues? He more likely isn't aware he is doing it most the time. But if he says I'm the most beautiful girl to him, shouldn't he not look at other women around me?    Oh and I'm 5'5 and weigh 160 lbs. I have a gorgeous face but I'm just 15 lbs over healthy weight.     Btw....any girl who says to deal with it, probably are more attractive than me. Of course you are confident, you're hotter than me!!

20090128184642AA8KTvL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	New GF but still thinking of Ex.?	Me and my ex of 2 years broke up this summer. It was a rough break-up. I found out she was kissing other men in her new home after she moved. * we were still together at the time.     After the break-up I started dating this other women who treats me well and does all the right things. It's been 3 months.    Whenever I'm with my new gf I don't think about anyone else but her. But when she's not here my mind moves back to the ex.     I've tried being just friends with my ex but she refuses while I'm in this relationship. *She's upset because I moved on too quickly.

Tomorrow, I'm spending two hours with him at school before my midterms. Any ideas on what to say? And also, he said he wanted a hug. I used to always get hugged by him/he used to alwayshold me.

I hadnt notice she was walking behind me and then she say "Hey *myname*." and then in a joking/flirty way said "You look really good today."       I realize she said it sortve jokingly but i know that i was not sarcasm. So basically my question here is, would a typical girl say something like that if she had no interest in a guy other than being just friends?

20090128191200AAJSR3J	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this girl a lesbian?	Okay, so there's a girl named Sarah in my class. She hangs out with the popular crowd, but she doesn't necessarily "look" popular because she isn't pretty or at least slim as most of the other popular girls. She wears boys' clothes everyday and she is NOT pretty at all, trust me, everybody would definitely agree. And this is the weirdest part of all: she calls this one popular girl named Julia her "girlfriend". Yeah, I know that girls can call each other girlfriends, in a sisterly way, but this is what I thought she meant at first when I heard her calling Julia her girlfriend. But I heard her saying this phrase "my one and only girlfriend Julia" in front of her friends A LOT of times, so I'm assuming she's homo. I mean, I call my friends girlfriends sometimes, but you don't need to say "my one and only girlfriend" to show your friendship, right? And, she's waited for Julia outside of my science class several times. I know this 'cause Julia's in my science class and she sits next to me, so she's got pretty close to me, but I dunno a lot about this Sarah girl, so I'm wondering if you guys also think that Sarah and Julia are lesbians dating each other. Sarah never says my one and only girlfriend to any girl other than Julia, so... What do you think?

20090128191809AApERoK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can't decide what I want.?	I am becoming very indecisive. Back in November my boyfriend and I broke up. Now I am dating a new guy (well an old ex). Very, very kind man who treats me sooo well. Problem is he is very sensitive and I go more for the masculine types now. My other ex the one I broke up with 3 months ago wants me backa nd won't stop calling and texting. Problem is he and I had problems that we could not fix. I like the masculinity of this one but not his anger problems. I like the kindess of the new guy but not his sensitivity. Don't get me wrong I like when a man can be sensitive but not this much. Everything I say is taken wrong and he gets upset easily and says I don't give him enough attention.

We are usually good, not always but almost always. we always act like we love eachother. except for the past few weeks we have been fighting. we got into a huge fight, then made it better and ever since then he has been ignoring me basically. i have tried to be nice at school and he just acts like he doesn't give a crap. what do i do? i am in love with him but this hurts, feels like he could care less, doesnt text me, barely answers mine. I know he loves me he said to his best friend just the other day he wouldnt know what hed do without me... so whats the deal? and what do i do?

Hey everyone I need some advice, it's been about 5 or so months of no contact with the ex and the other day I texted him (for some reason I started thinking about him but honestly didn't expect a response from him) but he responded.  My question is should I text him back (again) or just leave it be?      Also for anyone that's gotten back together with an ex or tried how did you go about getting back together with them?  What would the first steps be etc?  ~ I haven't ever been in this situation before so being in new territory I could use all the advice I can get :-)
20090128192505AAxDrYJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love question! please help!?	hi. ok my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me on monday something he'd never done before. his reason was that his mom hates me and she cried to him to leave me and also she used her mom(my boyfriends grandma) that is dying of cancer to dominate him and make him feel bad and leave me. i know it doesnt make to much sense but that is what he said. we were fighting and just got back together last week and everything was going awesome, we were also looking for a nice place to spend valentines and broadways shows. he hasnt call me and i texted him yesterday if it was possible to talk but he didnt reply. oh and he also sayd that he cant be with me until he moves out of his house, he is 26 and lives with his parents. do you think he got that planned? would he call?

20090128194417AAVAbjN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Hey, 'friendship' help please!? :)?	I've known this girl since third grade, and she is kind of weird. She has anger problems and no friends, and usually, what happens everyday is, she is so happy, weird, and funny. But out of no where, she gets really mad. Like one second, she'll be like "Pretty colors!" and the next "No, that's stupid!" And also, she is really smart. But sometimes, when she gets mad, she takes her anger out on herself, like pinching, hitting, or cutting herself. She can be really nice, and really mean also. My question is this, I know, she can be mean but, should I continue being her friend? I don't know, i sorta feel bad for her, I  mean, she would be nice and have lots of friends if she hadn't had anger problems... :(

I've been asking various questions lately, hoping to acquire some insight in dealing with a weight gain issue that has come up within my own relationship recently. After reading some of the comments I have received, I started wondering just how many girls out there are actually attracted to a guy who isn't "fat", but rather a guy (who doesn't have a double chin) who has a chubby butt, chubby cheeks, and a round belly that pat-roods when he stands up and rolls over when he sits down (just so you get the level of "chubby" that I am referring to)    I guess I am just wondering if girls think chubby on a guy is hot or even the least bit of a turn on.  Thanks!

For some reason i cannot get turned on by a guy with a small penis, i could like the guy and we could get along really well but when it comes to sex a average to small one does nothing for me visually. It could have to do with my second boyfriend that was huge, like 11 inches long and as thick as a can of coke, It was such a thrill looking at it when it was hard,and the sex was nothing like i ever had experienced. I don't know if to me a big one looks very manly or im just expecting some type of extreme pleasure like i received from my ex boyfriend. Just wondering if any girls think the same way or ever experience anything like what im going through because i feel bad but i cant help what turns me on.

20090128201054AAmk89p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating a guy but in love with another...... HELP!?	so i know this is a stupid silly question but i've been dating a guy for a year now, i've felt like i don't love him anymore for a while now, but i don't know what to do because he is completely and madly in love with me and i don't want to break his heart because after all this time i've grown too close to him, we're both kind of dependent of each other, but i see him as just a friend now and i don't want to see him hurt, i wouldn't be able to stand it if that happened, he means a lot to me but AS A FRIEND, i've broken up with him twice before, the first time i got back together with him because he was just so incredibly hurt and chanegd, he would stay in a corner and write suicidal and depressing poems, so i got back together with him, but shortly after that i broke up with him again, and the second time i got back together with him too (LONG STORY)  but now at a year of when we first started dating i'm helplessly falling for a new guy, he is like my dream guy, he is every i've ever wanted, he's like THE perfect mix for me, incredibly cute, amazing sense of style, amazing tase in music, amazing guitar player, he's the kind of guy that always has a guitar and his back (and i got a thing for guitar players), and he's also got an amazing and beutiful personality that makes me fall in love with him more and more as i spend time with him.... but i don't know what to do.         SHOULD I BREAK UP WITH MY CURRENT BOYFRIEND? AND RISK LOSING EVERYTHING I HAVE (BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LOVE HIM, HE'S EVERYTHING I'VE GOT, AND HE IS MY BEST FRIEND) AND TRY TO GET WITH THIS AMAZING NEW GUY? AND RISK A HEARTBREAK (BECAUSE HE MIGHT NOT LIKE ME, EVEN THO I AM PRETTY SURE HE DOES, HE ACTS DIFFERENT WITH ME THAN WITH ANY OTHER GIRL AND DOES CUTE LITTLE THINGS, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A MAYBE....)      OR SHOULD I JUST STAY WITH MY BOYFRIEND AND LIVE IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE THERE'S NO LOVE FROM ME?               BY THE WAY THIS IS A POEM I WROTE ABOUT ALL OF THIS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.                     but inside im dyin   this is so confusing   i hate it   i cant live with it anymore   i wanna run and scream   i wanna cry and die   i wanna be honest   i wanna have the strenght to do it   i wanna think about myself for a second   i wanna do whatever i want without caring who i'm killing   but most of all i wanna be happy without feeling guilty about it.      without feeling like i'm a monster   without feeling alone   without feeling like the bad guy in the story            but this will never happen   because i can't be selfish   because i would feel so guilty i couldnt live with myself   because i just can't do that....   because i can't destroy it   because i know that i WILL feel like a monster   because i guess i'm just not meant to be happy         and i guess i won't..................at least for a while   i'm gonna have to supress all this feelings and live the way i've been living.......            happiness won't find me til i find the strenght to pursue it.

20090128211150AAe6YTQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He changed the login password to sign into Windows and access his computer...?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 13 months. I spend 4 days out of every week with him, and for the past year, I've known his Windows password to login and use his computer whenever I needed to get on the internet. About a week ago, he randomly changed it, and now he won't tell me what it is. It just seems weird and a bit fishy to me. If he didn't mind me knowing it for a whole freakin year, then why would he suddenly change his mind? And I know a lot of people think of the whole bf/gf password situation as one person wanting to snoop through the other's email and stuff, but this is different. Should I be concerned or am I just overreacting? I'm not sure whether or not to bring it up to him because I don't want to sound paranoid. Any advice pleeeeeaaaaseee?

20090128205551AAO4iB9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can someone help me... should I be concerned about this?	have been dating a guy for 3-months, he is wonderful. I like him and it appears that we get along well and have a lot in common. As the months have passed, we have become more involved and at the same time closer on an emotional and intimate level.      He is 22. He has told me that he feels a connection with me, has never felt this way before about anyone, has never had a relationship like this and talks about "our future" together (as if to say he wants marriage). He has admitted that he "really really" likes me, but has not told me he loves me. He tells me he adores me on occasion as well.      We see each other on the weekends, as during the week I am at uni and he works. He has told me on many occasions that I am special to him, sometimes 3 times in the day!      But there is a problem that concerns me. He doesn't call me or message me all that often on the days that he doesn't see me. That is, he will call me perhaps every second day but sometimes will go more than 24-hours without contacting me.      Should I be concerned about his real feelings towards me based on this?

I have had three boyfriends in my entire lifetime, but I never felt   a connection with any of them, so I broke up with them in a matter   of 1-2 weeks of the relationship.   And now I really like this guy. And he likes me too. So he says.   He is the nicest guy I have ever met, and I dont know   how to tell him I have never been kissed.   He flirts with me a whole bunch and always talks about   kissing me, but never does it. Does that mean there   is something wrong with me or something?   Oh and he still hasn't asked me out yet.   How can you talk about kissing and stuff, if you are not going   out with the person? We have been talking since Jan. 5, 09.      And today, I think I ruined it all because I wouldn't show   him a guitar riff I made for the song that I made him.   I asked him if he was going to hate me if I did not show him,   and he said yes, I will. But I do not know if he was just   being sarcastic, so I totally flipped out and   said "well, If you chose to hate me, just know that I really like you.   A lot." And all he replied back was "tomorrow is okay".   So I decided to post a comment on his page   saying that what I said was all acting. I wasn't really   freaking out, and stuff. Just so I can cover up the fact that   I was freaking out.      And he is offline right now, so there is no reply.   I really want to know if he hates me or if I ruined it all,   or if i am just over analyzing things.   Which I do way too much actually.   I dont know what to do. I feel like I just need to give up on relationships.   Please reply ASAP.

I'm better than I was but I'm stuck for ideas on how to meet like minded people in my area. My biggest wish now is for me to have a big group of friends who I can have a laugh and a joke with and get in contact for regular meetups whether it be going out or just going round each others houses etc. I realise that a social life with real supportive friends would work wonders for my health and wellbeing but I just don;t know how to go about it.

20090225154834AAelDsZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Sister in law problem?	ok......here it is......      MY STORY: I'm 20 weeks pregnant and I also have a 20 month old at home, with no help. My mother in law used to live with us and she used to watch him while I got some stuff done around the house. Now shes over at my sister in laws house, helping her.      SISTER-IN-LAWS STORY: To begin with she has always had a problem with me ever since I got married to my husband (her brother-in-law). Shes 10 years older then I am, 38. She always used to compete with every single thing that I used to do....from home decorating to clothes and eating and everything. She has a 11 year old and she started treating her the same way I treat my son, whos 20 months old.    Ok so now here is the actual story......ever since I had my son, shes been wanting to have a baby. And for some reason she cant really have one naturally, so she tried IVF. The first treatment she had 2 embryo's inserted and after 5.5 months the babies passed away. We all helped her out around the house throughout the 5.5 months because she couldnt really do much. But she didnt appreciate anyone helping her out. She still had the same attitude towards everyone. Then she had another treatment with just one and this time her body didnt accept it at all. So now she had her 3rd treatment with 2 and the doctor told her to rest and she cant do anything around the house.    Now my mother in law wants me to go over to her house and cook for her, while she sits in her bed. Just to remind you all I have a 20 month old at home and I'm 5 months pregnant.    Is this fair for her to ask me to help even though she knows my situation? I have told her that I cant come over every single day to help, but she pretends not to understand. My mother in law cant do much because shes old, so that is why shes asking me to do it for her. I mean why dosent my sister in law get her mom to come and help?         They treat her 11 year old like a baby and she does not do anything around the house. If someone tells her to do anything then she starts crying and if she crys then my sister in law crys. Her husbands like there isnt much I can do because they both starts to cry if he says anything. My sister in law loves attention and I wouldnt be surprised if shes ONLY doing this for attention.
20070107012928AAxwCZ0	Family & Relationships;Friends	Self Esteem Help?	Ok, i need some advice. I used to be skinny when i was younger and it seemed that more people paid attention to me and girls were attracted to me. Now I am like overweight, and it seems that no one wants to talk to me or anything. And if people try to be friends or nice to me I think i like scare them off somehow. I feel that I could become a better person physically and that will then in turn help my personality. I know that if i were to lose weight i would probally be more attractive than most other people, but its really hard to lose weight. And i have like a problem with saying hi to people and like saying bye. My family and friends always get mad and i think that might be another problem with my friend situation.  an example, at school i could walk by one of my friends and pretend to ignore them and not see them, and dont say hi, are they ignoring me, or should i say hi, and they think that i am ignoring them and i dont like them. And how should i approach them? Please help thanks

20070526212821AACVkRt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friend needs help...?	OK here's the thing. My best friend used to be the boyfriend of this girl but was never actually in love with her. He always loved his high school sweetheart but they had lost contact, until recently. He finally met the girl (she loves him too) he loves again, and broke up with his girlfriend. However that girlfriend was too weak and started doing irresponsible stuff such as using drugs and other things. My friend now can't be with his true love, and staying by his dumb girlfriend's side. He's like babysitting her. He always tells me how much it hurts him cause he's dying to be with his 1rst love. I wanna help him but don't know how. He's now getting so down, and often drinks alcohol. That pathetic girl just wouldn't let him go. She even threatens him, if he leaves her she will do even worse things. I know some of you might say he's an asshole to break up with her, but he tried his best to love her. It just didn't work. What should he do? It's hard 4 me to see my best buddy fall down..

20070102124412AAAdHm1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I ask my 18 year old daughter to move out?	I love her so much, but she has made my life hell since she was about 12 years old.  She dropped out of school and is working at a fast food restaurant.  I know she's smoking pot and maybe is bringing it into our home.  She also doesn't abide by her curfew.  I've recently had a baby and the last thing I want is for my eldest daughter to bring drugs into my baby's environment.  Not to mention, the law.  There have been police cars parked in the neighborhood as if they're staking out a house.  I'm afraid it may be a drug dealer's house and what if my daughter goes there or is found there when they decide to do a drug bust.  I don't know where she would go if I made her leave.  I'm very torn and very hurt.  Please help.

20090225154652AAWgaI2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm still very much in love with him, but he seems to be completely over it. What should I do?	My boyfriend and I had been having problems for some time and I was suffering from verbal abuse amongst other things. I confronted him about it on Valentine's day and my words obviously meant nothing to him. When we finally spoke again he basically told me that he can't be bothered to try and change for me, and that things couldn't work out between us. I was heartbroken.      It's only been a week since then and he's been going on about how happy he is, how everything is going his way and he's full of energy. Personally, I can't get him out of my head and the heartache just keeps coming back. I feel hopeless and useless, looking forward to my future gets harder every day.      Advice please?
