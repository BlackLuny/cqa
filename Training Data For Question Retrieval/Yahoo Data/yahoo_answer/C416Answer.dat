And the dishwashing tablet?  Probably means you have to put that in BEFORE getting in.  You should do it right now and let us know how AWESOME it is!  I know I love MINE!  AND you should bring all your dirty dishes with you, so they can get clean too!  Good luck with your new place!

WtqsWctjaa	One of the great advantages that laminate flooring has over other types of flooring is how easy it is to keep clean. Generally speaking a simply brush over with a soft headed brush or a very slightly damp mop, is all that is needed when cleaning laminate flooring. Follow this with the use of a vacuum cleaner around the edges of the room, and also around any larger pieces of furniture that cannot be moved, and that is all that is generally required.<br>  <br>  For stain removal, do not use a strong detergent. Firstly, try using just warm water, but again, only use enough for removal of the stain in the small local area. In other words - don't over-wet the area. If this doesn't seem to work then try using a mild, non-abrasive cleaner. For cleaning of larger stains, etc. on laminate flooring, use a mop with ammonia or a mixture of water and vinegar.<br>  <br>  Where ever possible try to use citrus-based cleaners, and not the conventional soap-based cleaners|`|vgJHq2Mvaa	Hi, Just keep your floor swept with a broom or vacuum with a hard floor attachment that does not scratch the floor. This is important as dirt wears at the finish of laminate. <br>  <br>  When it is time to mop I just use warm water and vinegar 1 cup to a gallon. It works well and I prefer something that is natural. I just use a mop that is well wrung out so it is just damp. You do not want to wet floors. I sometimes buff up with a towel attached to my swifter. <br>  <br>  Soap-based products and citrus based products leave a residue on laminate making them look dull. It is good to use warm water as it evaporates more quickly. <a href="http://www.hardwoodlaminateflooringguide.com/cleaning-laminate-flooring.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hardwoodlaminateflooringguide...</a> Hope this helps|`|quuZXz0paa	just put lam floor in myself<br>  <br>  They sell a mop that comes with a micro fiber cleaning head that comes off to throw in washer.<br>  I still vaccumm mine first because dirt can still settle in grooves.

yaxmHitFaa	It may be as Sebastion F mentions above that if bleach did not work nothing will, however, I thought I'd share a product with you that perhaps might work.  The product is Soft Scrub Bleach.  My sister had stains on her formica countertop that only responded to this product.  She tried many if not all of the product type you mentioned, and the SSB was the only product that removed the markings.  They weren't burns, but maybe the Soft Scrub bleach will lighten the mark.  Hope this helps.|`|YYcR6lESaa	if bleach didn't work nothing will. if it realy bothers you just put something over it. a mat of holding hot pans when your cooking or a cutting board would easily cover the mark and be of some use to you.

Scrap out all the burned material with a razor knife, and use a solvent to clean out all the grease that may be present. I prefer epoxy because it hardens quicker. You may also want to check out the filler for the Corelle counter tops. They can be fixed with fillers also. just make sure you get the area really clean and then apply the filler. you will have to sand the area down to make it flush with the original surface. Just make sure you match the color of white.|`|4SGBr8cWaa	try 'marinating' it in a paste made from denture cleaner, i'd suggest an out of the way test area first, or you might try a light sanding with fine steel wool

xEbqX49oaa	Both previous answers are right.  Just though I'd add more.  Use both "green" and "brown" material.  Green is grass clippings, kitchen scraps, garden scraps, etc.  Brown is mostly dead leaves or rotting wood.  Layer the brown and green.  An equal amount of green and brown by weight is best but don't worry too much about this.  For quicker compost keep the pile damp, not wet, and turn at least weekly.  No matter what you do, if you pile organic matter together you will eventually have compost.

8apA3Rffaa	Ok Lets combine some of the answers, because you ll get confused and  it ll be harder w/o the right answers. One poster gave you some good advise ( basically) on how to do it butt... You ll use a foam type under layment. Yes you can start out w/ a whole and a 1/2 board but you must dry lay it out so you don t end up w/ a small pc on the far right end. Dont cut the boards up tight,, you MUST leave a 1/4" space . This is to allow the floor to properly expand and contract.. After you can cover this space w/ a shoe molding or if you take off the base bord, you can reapply that to cover the edge.The tapping block kit includes spacers..<br>    You need to now how to use a power saw.  A table saw works best..But you need a saw of some sort to cut the boards. <br>     Hint ... DONT try and cover the floor w/ the  under layment all at once , you ll be tripping on it all the time..Do only 1 row of it at a time.<br>     Acclimate the flooring in the room 3 days prior to installing.

bxlYleZkaa	Do Not cut the fireplace!!!! In a real Victorian house the skirtings would be butted up against the sides of the wooden mantel so that is the way you should do it!! Mark a vertical line on the skirtings on either side of the opening and cut them straight down with a cheap tenon saw from Wickes or B&Q. Split the surplus skirting out with a hammer and old chisel or screwdriver. Remove any protruding nails or screws from the wall. The legs of the surround will stand squarely on the floor and fit neatly against the wall.|`|nYRkAmdtaa	as above i love as trier . skirting off then cut skirting to length . you could chisel out skirting to correct length and then repair with filler , or if you have a piece of skirting then scribe on side of legs of fireplace and cut with coping saw and fill , good luck .|`|SI02JOQ4aa	Just cut into the skirting to take the width of the fireplace struts - do this for both struts then slide the firplace back to the wall.

8apA3Rffaa	Nicole and  Jenny  are absolutely right. There are special "mats" or pads to make this work.. And like Jenny said get one or cut one just an  inch or 2 less than the rug size..  These mats/pads  will have a 'tacky" feel , but they leave no residue and work great.  Make sure you get the type for rug over a soft surface.  These are also washable when the 'tackiness" gets dirty. You ll know when its time to wash them because they start to let the rugs walk again ..  Purchase at any flooring store or big box store.. GL|`|bxlYleZkaa	Grippertape/Catspaws.....the kind of tape with grips on it, available from carpet sellers.|`|vgJHq2Mvaa	Hi, A proper rug pad should prevent this. They are made to go under area rugs that are on carpets or for hard surfaces. They can come reversible for use on either bare floors or carpeting. Make sure the pad you get is for carpet. A rug pad also extends the life of your rug.<br>  <br>  They are not expensive and save you a lot of aggravation of straighting your area rug. The size you need is usually 2" less than the length and width of your area rug so that it will naturally fold over and not be seen.

Personally speaking I have used the tape on the market and it does not work. The tape gets filled with dirt build up, and if you have pets forget it. The tape does not stick. The rug pads are best as they encompass the entire area of the throw rug and there is nothing that the dust and dirt and pet dander can get stuck to. <br>  <br>  They are available at any store...Walmart, Target, Sears,Kmart, Home Depot, Lowes, Home Goods. etc. everywhere!!<br>  <br>  Average cost for a rug pad starts in at around $3.00 dependent on size. For larger rugs around $6.00-$9.00 for huge rugs.<br>  <br>  I use these under every throw rug I have on my carpets, and under throw rugs in my kitchen to prevent my dogs from sailing across the rooms.

If the rats are under her summerhouse, then they will charge her for the pest control.<br>  A quick call to the planning department will tell you if she needs permission.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	OK - rats are everywhere, that's just life.  From the best to the worst of places there is a good chance of rats.  They breed in storm water pipes, in bushland, in un-tended compost heaps and under houses. Rats are also very clever and can easily find their way under or over a fence.  These rats would not have magically appeared when the neighbour put in a sunhouse, they would have already been around.  If she has corgis in her backyard it is highly unlikely that the rats are coming from her yard as rats usually won't stay where there are dogs.<br>  <br>  Rats don't really carry disease - what makes us sick would also make a rat sick or kill it, that's why they are used in science as human analogues so often.  The fleas on the rats are a bigger problem.  As to disease in the urine, well, it's not like they pee much - a big wee for a rat is barely more than a few drops.  If you are worried about rat pee on their toys, don't leave them outside or give them a wash.  As long as kids don't put thier toys,grass or plants in their mouth and wash their hands when they've finished playing there is nothing to worry about.  If cats use your garden there is a risk of some diseases.  And do you worry about bird droppings?  Every backyard has bird poop they can't see (in the grass, on leaves of plants etc) and this carries the same kind of risks as rat urine.  Rats are not particularly dangerous as they are generally nocturnal (that is, they come out at night) and they tend to hide when humans are near, so there is virtually no chance of rat bites when the kids are playing.  <br>  <br>  Not letting kids play in the garden is simply paranoid - no harm will come to them even if there are rats about.  If you don't have other pets just lay some baits and make sure there are no accessible sources of water on your property.  Just touching the rats will not give you some disease and in the odd chance you found a dead one (as they will tend to go in search of water if you bait them) you can always wear gloves or use something to pick them up with.  Alternatively, buy a dog or a cat and you very soon the rats will be gone.<br>  <br>  Please, let the kids play outside, stop being paranoid and stop blaming you neighbour for the rats.  She might be snobby and annoying, but the rats aren't her fault.

The pants that you are wearing are to small.  If they were the correct size they would not be ripping out all of the time.|`|AA11693263	This happens to me with my tighter pants but for me, its also under the butt:) If you are adventurous and like funky styles, you can take some scissors and cut strips across the front and back of your pants (especially if they are jeans) at different intervals all down both thighs. Then get yourself some funky colored leggings or some fish net stockings (putting holes in those is good too :). Pair them with an awesome pair of heals or some knee high boots and one of those shirts that looks like a short mini-dress so it will cover up any holes that are too high up to be shown and viola......a look that is all your won because you made it:) The shirt should be a bit fitted, not to flared out if the pants are tight. That will look really cute. I am 36 years old and done the right way, looks really cute, not too "mom trying to look younger than what she is". :)
0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	I answered one of your earlier questions regarding almonds and my tree grows in temps up to 40 and down to -5 deg C.  Arid Australian site.    I checked my books and they suggest that down to - 1 deg C Ok but the books are more concerned about frosts than cold needed for fruit set.  The proper botanical name for almonds it Prunus dulcis or Prunus amygdalus.  Checking some agricultural sites should give you the info you need.    Not all books are accurate I've got one that says you need two trees to pollinate and I know I only have one tree that is self pollinating.    If you have your heart set on one, you could give it a try, the flowers are worth it even if it doesn't have fruit.    I also grow successfully grow Pecan nuts (Carya illinoinensis), and it needs a hot dry summer to produce nuts, so this may be another alternative that suits your climate better if you particularly want a nut.    They make a lovely tree and the variety I have 'Western' or 'western scheley', I picked because it was heat tolerant (will need a regular water though, but not too needy), it is also self pollinating.  It had nuts quite early.  Perhaps this is also worth a look.|`|uqLayZHraa	We live in south-eastern CT and we have an almond tree that does fabulous. The pink blossoms are beautiful and we get over 200 almonds from this tree. It is usually a favorite with bees, so I know that it gets pollinated from other plants and trees. We also have a hazelnut tree about 15 ft from the almond. The one pest that loves the almond tree is plumb curculios. They are worms that burrow through the husk and eat the nut that is forming. I'm not sure about your climate conditions. We do have cool/cold winters. Right now it has been exceptionally cold here with snow. Perhaps the link can answer some of your questions.
Oq5a5hRhaa	You should probably get something that is in the middle level of firmness. It varies by brand, but Sealy, for example, makes a medium, firm, and extra firm support pillow. You should go with the firm, in that case. Some other companies will simply say something like soft, medium, firm, and then you should go with the medium.<br>  <br>  You should find a store that has a good return policy. Some stores allow you to return products that were purchased online to the store (so you don't have to pay return shipping). It's unfortunately, very difficult to buy pillows without feeling them, so if you can get to a store it would be best. Otherwise, you're going to need the return policy.

It worked great.  One other thing that you may want to do is to knock the corners and sharp edges off of the plywood so that they don't wear through the upholstery over time.  Sandpaper will work - a router with a roundover bit is ideal if you have one.|`|gu7PLgyOaa	Try this website below!|`|AA11659117	You can always make your own or have daddy do it. It's cheaper than buying one.<br>  <br>  Materials:<br>  <br>  3/8" plywood<br>  Pencil<br>  Yardstick or other substantial straightedge<br>  Safety eyewear<br>  Power drill and medium drill bit<br>  Batting<br>  Fabric <br>  Staple gun and staples<br>  Sturdy buttons<br>  Large needle and upholstery thread <br>  Finish nails<br>  Mirror hangers<br>  Level<br>  Anchors<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mark the center point of the plywood and use a yardstick to draw a line across the diagonal with a pencil. Then draw an intersecting diagonal and with a pencil mark the point where the two lines meet . Maintaining the diagonal pattern, mark the entire surface with spots for more buttons, 12" apart. <br>  <br>  Put on safety glasses. Then use a power drill with a medium bit to drill holes through all the pencil-marked spots. <br>  <br>  Pick a piece of upholstery-weight fabric that is 6" or so longer than the piece of plywood on all sides. Lay it on a sturdy work surface, with the side you want to show facing down. <br>  <br>  Cut batting a few inches longer than the piece of plywood on all sides. Place it on top of the face-down fabric. Top it with a same-size piece of thin batting foam. <br>  <br>  Center the drilled plywood on top of the three layers of material -- fabric, batting and batting foam. <br>  <br>  Pull the foam, batting and material snugly over each corner of the wood and staple it (figure A). Do the same to cover the hard edges on the sides of the board. <br>  <br>  Select large buttons, possibly ceramic or antique glass. Secure them to the fabric-covered board with a large needle and upholstery thread (figure B): start by threading the needle through the drilled hole on the uncovered side of the plywood. <br>  <br>  To get the buttons secured tightly on the plywood, lay a finish nail on its side over each of the drilled holes on the back of the plywood. Once you've finished sewing each button, tie the ends to the finish nail. If you want a tufted look, with the buttons recessed in the fabric, twist the nail several times clockwise. This will create tension in the upholstery thread that will pull the button into the cushion-backed fabric. <br>  <br>  Hang the headboard with mirror hangers equidistant from the center of the headboard. Use the shortest screws that come with the kit -- you don't want the headboard to tilt out from the wall and hit people on the head. Use a level and an anchor if you can't find or don't have a wall stud available.

V9HNzXFuaa	Thats alot of kW, But your in a cold climate and have electric heat so its probably not that far off from normal.  I have oil heat here in PA and still use about 40 kW a day on average in the winter, so with colder temps and electric heat it will be alot more than that.  Reason being that most people don't use electric heat!
AA11228933	Sorry that you have those bills. Electricity is presently the most expensive way to heat. Poor insulation will not help and even a mild winter cannot stop the heat to come on.<br>  A lesson to be learned is find out beforehand the heat bills from the electric company. <br>  That's really the hard way to learn a lesson.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	We in the US use Hydro but it is mixed in the grid  with the rest of the different power sources|`|fNuMoHt7aa	I dont know what the rate of electricity is compared to my area but your costs do not seem high.

They put out alot of heat for when the temp goes down outside.<br>  Its also a great back up if the electric goes out.

Or you can save your money and get a Miele. Excellent build and often with lifetime guarantees!
v3xEtuLLaa	I use different guns for framing and projects like fence building.  For shed building, you will want a framing gun, such as a Porter-Cable FC350.  It takes nails from 2" to 3-1/4", so it will work for framing, sheathing, etc.    For building wood fences, I use screws for a lot of it, but for nailing I use a coil roofing nailer.  I can shoot nails from 7/8" to 1-3/4".  This works well with 1x stock, as well as 5/4 stock (some people like deck boards for pickets).  Either way you go, I'd get air guns.  Cordless framing guns, although convenient, are expensive to buy and operate.  Hope this helps.|`|bvM4yWDhaa	Ive worked as a framing carpenter and now I am a Professional plumber    I just built a screen porch on the back of my deck and it involved Alot of nailing I found a product made by Ridged(  a good manufacturer)  that pounds individual nails up to 31/2"  you cant shoot yourself in the hand with it and you can to nail boards with it and it ONLY cost $75 wait until you use it you will love it I actually wrote a letter to Ridged complementing the great invention and Iv e never done that before one of if not the greatest tool ive ever owned|`|u4NXQkq7aa	well i am a stanley bostwich man my self  but many types out there rigid r very good u can find sets at home depot or sears with a air compressor and 2 or 3 guns included and a hose for next to free so go to www.homedepot.com and take a look at some options just remeber to oil before every use and will last many years|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	I think you will want a framing gun. If you aren't in the trades, then strip fed nails are nice. I have both Paslode and Makita strip fed framing nail guns. The Makita is heavier and larger, but both do a good job of driving nails. If I could only have one framing gun, it would be a Paslode. I say this because you have almost limitless types of nails you can get. I have trouble finding the right ones for the Makita.    I put a link into a site that sells factory refurbished Paslodes, but please do check the Internet for deals and prices. When I just searched I saw a new one in the box on Craigslist for VERY cheap!
XQiH90x2aa	solve your problem , dont cover it up . you need to kill the spiders .|`|AfnOU04paa	It's hard to tell why the insects are coming through.  Do you have an attic above the ceiling or is there another room? What are the vents for; heat, A/C, exhaust fans?  Once the weather starts warming up, spiders and insects wake up and start looking for food and water.  You will not usually find insects in a hot dry attic or in heating ducts.  They like humidity and a close water source.  First find out if there is a source of dampness or water like a leak somewhere. You could get the ducts cleaned by a professional cleaner.  Don't block off the vents.  I would buy a couple of cheap furnace filters, and take them apart and cut up the fiber matt to fit inside the vent covers.  Maybe spraying an all purpose insect killer through the vents, but if they blow air, it will just come back out, maybe make you sick.
4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	The problem is either your pressure tank or your pressure switch. Since the switch is governed by the pressure in the tank, I would suspect the switch first - not the tank. You could check your pressure tank pressure using a tire gage, and make sure it is in the owner's manual operating range. The pressure switch tells the pump when to turn on and off - which is what fills the pressure tank. To check the switch, run the water until the switch closes and the pump turns on. Note the pressure at which it turns on. Now watch the pressure as it builds and note at what pressure it turns off. If you want less pressure, adjust the switch accordingly. We have ours set to come on at 42  and turn off at 65 . Our pressure tank air setting is 35 PSI.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	too much pressure in your pressure tank bleed some air out. reset pressure.

Water and cover, until it sprouts. Let it dry out a bit between waterings.<br>  <br>  It needs a lot of light, and a fairly long season (I remember it at 100+ days).

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Are you asking if you can use two heaters in tandem?  In unison?  So you have more hot water?  Yes.  It's possible.  But the more desirable situation would be a bigger water heater.  For obvious reasons.    Edit-  Here's my next question to you:  Why do you have low pressure from the street?  Do your neighbors have low pressure also?  Is the pressure low only at certain times of the day?  Such as a high usage time like in the morning when people are using water to take showers and water their lawns?  Something might be wrong at your water main,  like an obstacle blocking the pipe.  Or the main shut-off is corroded and needs replacing.  You'll still have pressure,   but the volume would be cut dramatically...  I would call your service provider first,  before you do anything,  and make sure that's not the case.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	you need a pressure tank.|`|ihbqJAGUaa	Talk to your neighbors and check their pressure and water volume. If there systems are good the problem lies with your service from the shut off at the main to your basement. Replacing the service would be your best option. Yes, you could install a pressure tank but with diminished water volume you still can run out of water. A new service would eliminate the need and maintenance expense for pumps and tanks and increase your property value.|`|zob4spgGaa	Please explain - volume reserve for what?|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	First, your water heater must be kept full, to the top, with water to function properly, it can not be pressurized with air to make more water pressure at your fixtures.  However, you can put a separate resevoir tank in the line, either before or after the pressure pump.   If you put it before, you'll  have more water available for pressurization into the system.   If you put it after, it will become the pressure tank, and  you'll have a larger resevoir of pressurized water.

If you happen to have potted plants in the house, it's a good bet that's the source for their breeding. The adult gnats lay their eggs in the wet soil, the eggs hatch and their larvae spend time in the wet soil till they become adults, emerge and fly around your house.      If their populations become too high, they can feed on the roots of plants which will then lend itself to fungal infection or general weakening of your plant.    There are a couple of simple things you can do to eliminate them safely;      1) Drench your soil with a mixture of "Safer's Soap"... or you can mix some dish soap 4 or 5 drops into a cup of warm water, then thoroughly soak the soil with this solution. The soap will break down the chitin (waxy outer coating) of the insect (larvae) and they'll eventually die. Remember to remove any excess water after the soaking.    You can find "Safer's Soap" at most hardware/nursery shops...it's very safe and you can use it as a spray to safely eliminate most insects on plants.    2) Place 1/4" of clean sand over the top of the soil in your potted plants. This will prevent future breeding of adults....which lay eggs directly in the wet soil. The sand acts as a barrier and allows water and fertilizers to penetrate.     It's not uncommon to over-water during the fall and winter seasons. In the future, try to keep the soil of your houseplants moist and NOT wet.     Hope this helps solve your problem.  GOOD LUCK!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i had them once and i couldn't figure out where they were coming from. then i went down stairs and found an old bag of potatoes i had forgotten about. that's where they were. check under you sink, where you store your fruit, vegetables, potatoes, onions and make sure none are rotting.|`|AA10097817	Put your question up in the search box.

It has plenty of information about planting dates for your area. All you do is type in your area code, and then go to the tab that says "Gardening" and select the "Planting Dates" It gives plenty of basic information, including the best Days of the months to plant them! However, some of them are stricter than what it really is. For example, it says for my area (95695) to plant onions in February, but i actually plant mine in October!    ps i looked up Central Georgia's Area code and i got the number "31015" and for potatoes it says February 10-28, but you can go off within a couple weeks of that :)    Hope that helps!
y31mee4Faa	Yes, with lumber of that dimension, your house could be worth a tidy sum dismantled.    Elms are tall, straight trunked, hardwood trees.  Elm is used to make hockey sticks & javelins.  It's a wood you don't hear about much because so many were wiped out in the 50s & 60s by Dutch Elm disease.    Goofy's wrong about elm being mushy or falling apart with water exposure as elm wood was used in London to make water pipes & was used all over Europe for bridge & pier pilings.      It has also been used for to make furniture, in boat & shipbuilding, for wagon wheel hubs, sills for buildings & farm implements.    There is the possibility that the lumber could also be chestnut.  A wood that came close to extinction in the US because so much of it was cut for railroad ties during the railroad boom.    Your best bet on identifying it would be to take a piece to a cabinet maker.    Here's some links about reclaimed wood:    http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/09/...    http://www.woodplanet.com/company_dir/Ol...    http://www.recycle.net/trade/aa1030576.h...    http://www.woodfibre.com/a/wf0380.html        Good luck...|`|jSBtdhf0aa	if your house is that old ill bet it is oak. ig its that well constructrd i think i would remodel instead of tearing it down.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Old furniture certainly was made from elm.

I'd try local cabinet makers or custom woodwork people, any artist who works in wood. They're always wanting something interesting, and a lot of old wood was very good quality. Also, since you know when your house was built, I wonder if that might be worth a little something extra on the price of the wood; it has a provenance, as they say on Antiques Roadshow. I'd make sure to take some good photos of the house before you dismantle, to show where the wood came from.|`|NLKVrdIKaa	I can't give any good answer EXCEPT it ain't elm wood.

This is common in older homes If the bang happens right when the burner ignites you are having a ignition, combustion, or ventilation problem call service. You can trace down banging ducts and add bracing to stop it, if it's caused buy expansion. If it's the burner get inspection and cleaning deal, that will most likely fix it.

Some plants have male and female, others are asexual and simply need a second plant of its kind.   I learned this when my blueberry bush produced berries the summer after I planted it, and then nothing for two years. When I told my aunt about it, she told me to get a second bush. Sure enough, after I got a second bush next to the first, I started getting berries again.

RuMsTCyIaa	Your landlord is more like a slumlord. You might need to seek legal help if he keeps pressuring you to pay for this. I believe this was indeed not caused by your rabbit. Did you even bathe the rabbit recently? Many landlords of rental property do not take proper care of their sewage lines. Odds are this line is going to clog again and again and due to no fault of your own.    Anywho, in the future you should pour one cup of chlorine bleach down each drain in your household once a month..and then leave the house for an hour while it does its job. This regular use of bleach will help keep your drains clear.    I should mention that even though hair in the drain is normal it can be proven that you're negligent. Like I said above, clean the drains regularly. If you live in an apt month after month there is no way the landlord can check your drain each month, you have to take a little responsibility.  You can't put hair in the drain and expect them to fix it when you could have prevented it.|`|6O4WTiPQaa	Tell that chump to go and get f***ed, there's no way rabbit hair caused the stoppage, there must have been a restriction in the line (tree roots or a broken or collapsed sewer) to cause the rabbit hair to not get washed down the line.  Just because the plumber may have retrieved some rabbit hair on his snake when he unclogged the drain, that doesn't prove anything.  You weren't negligent and if it went to court the landlord couldn't prove anything.|`|ww12lItvaa	I would think there would need to have been a restriction for hair to clogged a main drain line.

Make him take you to court and prove it. Take pictures of the hair? If you go to court do NOT admit washing your rabbit in the tub whatever you do. MAKE the silly bastrid prove it's your fault. Hair in a drain is normal maintenance. Little rabbit hairs I doubt would clog it alone. it might have contributed to it, but alone? No way..no how, no where.

sDM7dR5Taa	The reason a lot of fixtures instruct you to use a certain wattage (usually 60W or less) is because of the heat that the bulb generates. The more energy used to make a brighter light, the more heat is generated. This becomes especially crucial when the bulb is in an enclosed fixture where the heat will be trapped and cannot cool quickly or if the bulb is to be used in a ceiling fixture or any fixture where the bulb is inverted (heat rises).    Most of the wiring for light fixtures is only rated for the lower heat that a 60W will generate. Any higher, and you run a serious risk of melting the wire insulation. This will at the very least ruin the light fixture and at the worst, become a fire hazard.    For table lamps where the shade affixes directly to the bulb, the bulb is close enough to the shade that the heat could melt or burn the shade if the wattage is high enough.    So, if it specifically states a certain wattage, I would not go any higher. Hope that answers your question. Feel free to ask for any clarification.|`|P4ICKZS5aa	You can lower in wattage not higher, should be fine as long as the bulb has the same base.|`|AA10097817	Put them in now, but go out asap to buy the right wattage.|`|fQgbBx7caa	I am not concerned about the 40 watt but be sure the 75 watt is ok to use because a lot of fixtures will only accept up to 60 watt, check the fixture out for information.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	You're fine. The bulb might burn out a little faster, but thats all. Perfectly safe. Now the other way around might be a problem.. a higher watt bulb can burn the lamp parts.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	As long as the fixture is rated for the 75W. lamp   you can put in any smaller lamp that will fit the socket.  Do not put a 75W. lamp in a fixture marked for '60W. maximum',   even if the other lamp is smaller.   The rating doen't work that way  Maxiumum means just what it says per socket.|`|APHAcdGaaa	Yes the fixture are safe up to 120 watts so it doesnt matter if there are two different size bulbs.

256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	Makes the sellers get permits and get the permits fully signed off before you buy.  It is far worse than the simple fact that some of the work may be shoddy.  What if the addition violates zoning - like it's too close to the neighbor's property line or too tall or too much square footage for the size of the lot.  I've seen cities make people cut two feet off of a completed house that was over the setback line.  Don't get stuck with the previous owner's problems.    Lemmee guess - the house is in California?  I bet not getting permits was as much about not wanting to pay their property taxes as it was about not wanting to deal with inspectors.      Edited:    So it being a Prop 13 dodge is actually encouraging.  I'd knock on the neighbors doors and just ask them what they know.  You'll quickly learn if any of them are feeling hostile about a setback issue or other problem.  Then go to city hall, go to planning dept with the exact address and get the zoning regs.  What are the side setbacks, rear setback, front setback, any height restrictions, any square footage limitations, does it have a basement, does this municipality count basements in square footage calcs, coverage restrictions (permeable vs non, so the square footage of the house, garage, driveway , walks, and patios is non-permeable - all that added up and divided by the square footage of the lot is percent coverage and it's easy to bust this number.  Go back to the house and start measuring.  Be careful, front setback is to property line, not street and it can be dangerous to assume that fences are on property lines, though you can ask about that when you meet the neighbors.    Ask if you can speak with an inspector - your chances are way better over the counter than over the phone.  It's almost certain that the homeowner violated title 24 - a CA energy conservation rule.  So, if you buy it and get permits and get it inspected will they make you bring it to title 24 compliant - that could get expensive and ruin the house (when you start having to change big windows for smaller ones).    You're taking a risk - are you getting a bargain.  Is it still a bargain is the cost of dealing with the lack of permits is $3000 minimum and could be $30,000?  If so, well, then you have a decision to make.    You could find an architect who works in the community that the house is in and is familiar with the local zoning regs, title 24, etc.  For a few hours consulting fee he could look at it and tell you what sort of hassle the inspectors might bring you.  In my experience, most building inspectors just want you to have a safe home, if you talk to them right, they'll make it as painless as they can.    If the house is in Silicon Valley send me a message and I'll tell you an architect that would be a good choice.    Of course, many people would ask their mortgage broker if they could get a loan in spite of the lack of permits and go for it if the answer is yes.  The building inspector is not going to come knock on the door and demand to inspect the house - in CA they'd be a lifetime given the huge number of homes with non-permitted construction.  But then, someday you will want to sell and then you'll have all this crap again.|`|2zhQznahaa	No don't still buy the hosue.

Class II transformers have a maximum VA (Volt-Ampere) rating of less than 100 and a maximum secondary output of 30 VAC. The maximum VA generally offered is 75 and the most common secondary voltage is 24 VAC. All Class II transformers are either inherently or non-inherently limited. This means that the maximum output current of the transformer is limited, either by the intrinsic coil impedance or by a fuse or circuit breaker.       Good luck...
