20090221032721AADzc41	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Weak, crackly sound from surround speaker...?	I own a Pioneer VSX-D712 receiver to which I have connected two front speakers, two surround, a center channel and a subwoofer (so... a 5.1 setup). My problem is that the right surround sounds very crackly and weak. I know it can't be the speaker itself, as I've tried two sets of speakers with the same result. Is taking it in to repair my only option?      Also, as long as I've owned the system, I've felt overall it seems quite weak without the aid of a subwoofer (and if you listen closely the speakers sound a little muffled or metallic). I've fiddled with the settings, including turning the subwoofer off on the receiver and setting the speakers to "large", but only slight improvement. It just doesn't seem to have any real "oomph". And just recently I tried the bookshelf speakers from this setup with an old amp and the difference was huge! All of a sudden they came to life. I never realised they had so much power... and it really makes the sound the Pioneer receiver was putting through them sound utterly poor. It's never seemed such a big problem until I was able to make the comparison. I have a feeling I must be missing something... as surely the receiver can't be THAT bad??

It's a professional one with an amp and all that. I need it now, not six weeks from now when they get around to fixing it. In the past, there would be one tray that wouldn't recognize the disc. Now, the tray just keeps turning and doesn't recognize ANY CD I put in there, burned or not. I've blown the dust out of it. I'm using a crappy cheap boom box right now, but have a big middle school concert coming up in four weeks. Any ideas?

20090221030424AAWUV5a	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Need Playstation 3 Help!?	Hello, About 2 weeks ago I got a Ps3, And i've been having it pluged into my 52inch HD TV. I've been using my xbox 360 Hd cable to put into the ps3 output and swapping them over.       I think i might have either been pushing it into the ps3 with too much force, or pulling it out. As now the Output will not work.      This morning when i went to unplug the ps3 hd cable to my xbox then back it wouldn't work. All it showed was a blank screen, but my tv did pick up the signal of it.       I know it's not the cable as when i plug it into my 360 it will work. I tried the normal tv cable into my old tv and it didn't work. Although Im not sure if i plugged it in right.      Does anyone know what's the problem and wether i could fix it or get someone to fix it.
