I am interested in pursuing it in college, so i plan to do varsity throughout high school.  I have a few questions about track, and if you could answer any of them that would rock.  Thanks.      Info: I don't do any field events but I'm open to trying some if they help me get into college track.  My fastest time for the mile, when I am in shape (now not so much) is 7 minutes 25 seconds.  My fastest time for the 400 when I'm in shape, is 71 seconds.  I am a sprinter.  I am 5"4 1/2, and 113 lbs. I do spring and winter track (that makes 2 seasons ive done so far)      Q1. How hard is it to get into college track?   Q2. What are the best ways/techniques to become qualified for college track?   Q3. Does anyone know if the University of Miami has a good track team?  Is it hard to get into? I was thinking about there....   Q4: What is my best bet when it comes to field events?   Q5: How can I train to improve my sprinting times?      Oh and I'm not too young to be thinking about these things I don't think.  I have my heart set on doing lots of academics in college, but now that I've discovered track I'm pretty sure I want to do that too.  I just want to be trained and fast enough and have enough credentials to get into a college track team.

20090222163834AA4DdnJ	Sports;Winter Sports;Snow Skiing	Ideas for mens' downhill boots for large/low calves?	I currently have a pair of heavily modified Salomon Performa 5.0 men's ski boots (size 26) that have been professionally modified (custom foot beds, removed movable calf cuff support, and heat altered and cut/notched shell material at the calf) so that I can even wear them for a few hours.  The boots are in need of replacement and I would like to get some ideas of intermediate-level boots: Brands/models to try.  I have giant calves, that are very low, a high instep, but normal width feet.  Someone recommended heel lifts, but I also have a high instep, so that tends to crush the inside of my ankle.  (BTW, I already lean against the "shins" of the boots (even just to latch the boot), but the top of the cuff still digs into my calf muscle most of the time.  About 90% of boots I can't even latch at the calves.  I am just looking for starting points from other boot fitters, since the models change so much year to year.

20090222172954AALhKnx	Sports;Other - Sports	Why is it that star athletes usually do not make great coaches, but medicore athletes do?	Magic Johnson was not a very good coach. He didn't like it, was constantly frustrated, and the players weren't fond of his coaching style either. His only coaching year was also the lone year in the 90's that the Lakers did not make the playoffs.      Michael Jordan is said to not be a great general manager. He was responsible for picking some players in the first round that turned out to be scrubs.      However, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin played football in college but wasn't good enough to make the NFL. But, he has a Superbowl Ring as well as a "coach of the year" award.      Phil Jackson was a mediocre player in the NBA yet is considered one of the greatest coaches of all time.      And there are other examples but there's no need to go on.       Why do star players tend to be mediocre coaches? One theory I can come up with is that star players have extremely high standards that most players cannot meet.

20090222180127AAZTtd3	Sports;Baseball	Who was using steroids (stats inside)...?	Think you know who was using the magic waters, and who was not?      Here are six players, and their seasonal plate appearances per home run (PA/HR) for a continuous span of seasons sometime between 1990 and 2008. A lower number means HRs are being cranked out at a faster rate. Raw HR totals don't account for opportunities, so a rate is more telling.      It's not important who the players are, and you don't have to guess names. Just eyeball these stats and see if you can tell which ones were (maybe) juicing. Three are Highly Suspected (or Worse) Of Using, and the other three are Desperately Hoped To Have Been Clean. Each is a genuine slugger with more than one season of 40+ HR. Seasons marked with a asterisk * are ones where the player had less than 150 PA, so the data might look a bit influenced by a small sample size.      A: 21.9, 29.6, 16.5, 13.6, 16.2, 16.2, 18.5, 24.6, 39.3, 16.4, 19.8*, 22.4, 15.8, 17.3.      B: 19.4, 18.3, 17.5, 13.5, 19.3, 10.9, 11.3, 14.1, 11.1, 13.6, 14.7, 15.4, 30.3.

E: 18.3, 19.9, 15.9, 15.0, 17.1, 12.9, 21.2, 17.3.      F: 22.9, 15.5, 12.3, 18.5, 13.0, 12.6, 12.9, 14.7, 15.8, 19.0, 29.0, 15.5, 17.4, 15.9, 17.5, 20.8.      For comparison, Ruth, 1920-34:   11.4, 11.7, 14.1, 17.0, 14.8, 17.0, 13.9, 11.5, 12.7, 12.8, 13.8, 14.4, 14.4, 16.9, 21.4.      And, none of the six above are Alex Rodriguez.

20090222164001AAm0ubn	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	AR 15: What will be banned under the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, assuming it gets enacted again?	Hi all. I am reading about the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 because I hear that a similar ban will be enacted under Obama.       I presently have an AR-15 A2 with a standard stock and no flash suppressor, bayonet mount, etc. According to the Wiki article, it states that it prohibits:      Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and two or more of the following:   Folding stock   pistol grip   Bayonet mount   Flash suppressor, or threaded barrel designed to accommodate one   Grenade launcher (more precisely, a muzzle device which enables the launching or firing of rifle grenades)      My question is this: Lets say in the future (after a similar ban is enacted) I decide to upgrade my AR and I want a collapsible stock. Would I be able to purchase the collapsible stock in the future? I am not asking if it is legal to put this on my rifle, but I am wondering if I would be able to go to my local shop and purchase one (legally). What about a threaded barrel? Would I be able to purchase one in the future? A flash suppressor? How about the 30 round magazines?      Thank you for your help.

20090222171736AA7UBO3	Sports;Rugby	What is most important in training for Rugby, and what position would I be best at?	I can't this year (money issues), but next year I'll be joining my High School's rugby team. I love the sport, but I'll need to get in shape and save up for the dues.      To condition for Rugby next year, what should I do? I would think that working my core would be most important, along with stamina and arm strength. What should be my priorities?      Also, where would I fit in best on the pitch? I'm a pretty big guy. 6'2'', 240 lbs, built like a refrigerator. The thing is, my best skill by far is kicking. I used to play punter in American Football, and I can kick a ball very well. I also have really long legs and my stride is really big, so I can outrun quite a few people if I'm sprinting.

20090222180835AAiCaJG	Sports;Running	Based on my body form, what race should i run in track?	its about a week into the track season,and ive gotten fed up with this long distance training.  im not sure why it is, but its just stressing me out having to try to play catch up all of the time.      ive decided to switch out of long distance.      what do you think i should do based on this:      weight:116      height: 5 foot 9 ish      grade: 9 if it matters....      Body shape: skinny, thin but powerful leg muscles for their size.      Flexibility: pretty nice compared to most.      In seventh grade i ran the hurdles and 400/100 and was not bad at it. i think the only reason i got like fourth all the time in 100 meters is because i was slow off the starting block.       i was alright at the 200 when i did it a little bit in 7th grade.  i got like 30 seconds i think. but that was without doing it too much.      SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
