In '93 on MTV, we'd never change the channel,   Because we were watching a special man wearing a shirt of flannel,   Who is the one who makes all our pains and woes feel better?   Well, the answer to this, my friends is simply Eddie Vedder.      We watched him sing Jeremy and also Evenflow,   But, my favorite thing he says is "LET MY PEOPLE GO!",   I like his hair very much. I think I'll write him a letter,   Because he is a special man with the name of Eddie Vedder.      He has such an amazing face, I don't know what to say,   And perhaps, I'll even get to read him this poem one day,   If I find his adress, I'd like to send him a sweater,   This crazily-awsome guy, who I call Eddie Vedder.            #2. The Mall      When you go to the mall!!!!   You feel like you're tall!   Not because of the mall, because of the couch!   And it makes you say "OUCH"!   And someone steals your face and puts it on a popcan!   And they yell at you for being a Primus fan!   And you say, "I like Les Claypool!"!   And they say that he's not cool!   Then you go to the food court!   And you say, "Smorty, smorty smort"!   And they don't understand you!   So, you pretend to be a cow and say moo!   And you try to order a burger!   But, you say, "Smurgy smurger."!   And they think you're insane!   But it's just your brain!   Then you take your face off the popcan!   And you say, "Phlegmy phlam phlan!"   But then they chase you!   The want your face but you decide to say "MOOOOO"!   You go into Dillards to hide!   But, you didn't know that they spied!   Then Eddie Vedder pops out of the ceiling!   What crazy shmo shmazy feeling!            #3. The Loonies in the Corn      There be loonies in that corn!   They hide between the rows!   There be loonies in that there corn!   They scare away the crows!      They speak in gibberish and twitch alot!   They're afraid of clouds!   But, they can never ever be caught!   Because of their secret shrouds!      The loonies hop up and down!   They chase their own hands!   They're always smiling, never a frown!   They know no other lands!      There be crazies in the ears!   Sometimes, they think they're dogs!   They get anxious as daybreak nears!   They think they'll turn into logs!      There be loonies in the corn!   They live in corn husk huts!   There be loonies in that there corn!   Everyone knows they're nuts!            Which is your favorite?

20090304195208AAk9b2n	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I really need some help?	So last year I had a whole bunch of friends, but they all left and went to a different school.. and now I found out that they changed and all of last year was a lie. Well for me at least.      So now all I have is someone who talks to me when her other friends aren't there, basically the left over that no one wants. And a friend who is only friends with me because she feels the same way with everyone too. It's just she doesn't really even like me.      I go to a private school that is known as outcast compared to the other school we have to share the same building with. So basically no one in my private school, which only has a few people... and the whole other 2 thirds I wont even bother..      I feel so alone, and I feel like I need to change my self into someone sporty because everybody in my school is sporty. But I know, that's rediculis, but if you were in the same situation as I am... what else can you do? could you survive without friends?...      I know your just thinking of course because you have family... but if you think about it, the only reason my family loves me,. is because I'm in their blood line.       No one I know really wants to be with me, no one.       So anyone on here have any good ideas on how I could deal with this?    anyone?..

20090304222919AAmBCKl	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Haha milk-man! true story about a friend?	this year's senior class at my school has been trying to raise as much hell as possible. well my class (juniors) wanted to try and come up with something hilarious. a friend of mine brought in an old expired milk carton that he had got a while back and during one of our lunches threw it up in the air. it hit one of the speakers hanging from the wall and the top bursted (word?) off and sprayed EVERYWHERE. needless to say, the rest of the school smelled horrible (that sweet aroma of rotten milk/cheese). i personally thought it smelt like cheetos but whatever haha. to make matters even funnier, it soaked a couple of seniors who were trying to find out who threw the carton and were gonna beat him up for ruining their clothes. it took the administration about 3-4 days (and a couple of snitches) to pin-point the 2 kids who brought and threw the carton. both kids got 10 days out-of-school suspension (fiting only gets 3 days in-school...strange?) and one of the kids is on the baseball team with me and both are in my english class. well the news spread about who had done it and one day while we were taking roll in class the english teacher got to this kid brought the milk and goes "o yeah, corey wont be with us for 2 weeks!" infront of the class. during baseball conditioning 2 days later the coach was going through roll and got to him and goes "wheres corey?" there was a long pause while all of us looked at each other with a smerk and he goes "thats right, milk-man wont be with us for a while!"

20090304223842AAc4Twd	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	What do you think about Britney Spears "If You Seek Amy"?	Me and my 6 year old were coming home from the dentist today and I heard "If You Seek Amy" for the first time. I thought it was a cute song and we were really into it...kinda singing along. Well then I heard there was controversy over the song and thought to myself "Why?" So I decided to do my research and it took me awhile. It actually had to be spelt out for me (In other words, I didn't get it by just listening to the lyrics) and although I thought it was very clever how she added in that everybody wants to F-U-C-K-Her, I will not let my daughter listen to or sing along to the song ever. I just want to know what everybody's opinion is about the whole thing and if they agree that the song is not suitable for children, even though children may not understand what she is implicating. And even if they don't know what they are saying, I think I would have a problem with a bunch of youngins singing "All the boys and girls want to If you seek Amy (F-U-C-K-me). In fact I will be a little upset to hear my daughter sing along with the song, aside from earlier today when I had no idea. So what does everybody think and if you think that the song should be banned from daytime radio? Just curious, I guess.

20090304231237AAhIVCd	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Can you solve this "story with holes"?	You know those obnoxious riddles that were so much fun when you were a kid, where you're given a non-specific description of an event then have to figure out the details using only yes or no questions?  I think they're sometimes called stories with holes.        For example: Jack and Jill are lying dead in a puddle of water.  Nearby, Janey is sleeping peacefully on the couch.  What happened? (Jack and Jill are goldfish and Janey is a cat who knocked their bowl over.)  Or: A man is lying dead in a field with a ring on his finger and a pack on his back.  How did it happen? (He's a skydiver who pulled the ring on his rip chord only to have it fail, leaving him dead with an unopened parachute pack on his back.)      Anyway, my question is, have any of you fellow stories-with-holes enthusiasts ever heard of one that goes something like this:     A man lies dead in a swimming pool surrounded by scissors.  He has no wounds on his body.  What happened?      This riddle used to be something of a legend in my family when I was a kid, because we all knew the question but not the answer.  I suspect that there was no answer, but I thought I'd check here to see if it's familiar to anyone else... It's driven me nuts since I was a kid.

20090304234024AA1WQuq	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Please explain this short poem....The dogs they had a meeting.?	And they come from near and far.   Some came on bicycles,   And some of them came by car.   Y'know, before they could enter,   Or even take a look,   They had to take their asshole off,   And hang it on a hook.   But before they even got seated,   Every mother, pup, and sire,   An old dog hollered from the back,   "Run for your life. It's a FIRE!"   The crowd of dogs began to panic,   And nobody stopped to look.   They grabbed the nearest asshole,   Off the very nearest hook.   And this is why, even today,   A dog will drop a nice juicy bone,   And go to smell another dog's ***,   To see if it's not his own.

20090304225306AAZIl8d	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Are the Aliens actually  *evil*?	I don't know what I'm missing here, but the nature of the Aliens seems inconsistent throughout the entire franchise.      One minute, the aliens are tearing people apart with their teeth and claws, and we're meant to assume that they do this because they're braindead killing machines that kill anything they see that's not their kind.      And then the next minute, instead of killing people, they kidnap them and take them to their hives to have them impregnated by facehuggers.      Is there an explanation for why the aliens desire to kill people one minute, then try to repopulate their race the next minute? Do they actually want humans dead but also have a plot to raise their numbers and take over the universe?

20090304225118AAga0RN	Entertainment & Music;Movies	How is the movie Saw satire?	My assignment was to explain how the movie Saw, part 1, is satirical. I think one is the man who is a cutter, cuts his risks/arms, was abducted and put in a cage made of razors and barbed wires. Basically, Saw believed that this man wants to hurt himself or wants to commit suicide but falls short so he puts this man in this cage and sees if he will realize that suicide or self inflicted injuries is not the answer.. so he's basically making this man fight for his life when he actually wanted to die.      I don't know what else is satirical about it besides that, because I'm a bit scared to watch it alone since no one wants to watch it with me... lol so if you guys can help me out on this, I'll greatly appreciate it!

Dead, skin deep.   A place where beauty was once thought to be.   This can't be me.   I can't fight it alone.   Although in a crowd that's what I am.   No one is shown.

This has got my hopes up and I really want to learn to play other songs.      Can anyone offer me any tips in how to be able to recognize the rhythm of the music better or how to know when to play the strings in a downstoke, upstroke, stops the strings from vibrating, letting the strings ring on because often times, it's hard for me to recognize how to play the song, even when I watch the video of the artist playing it.

20090305015621AA7KIEg	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ THIS!?	Okay recently I have found some homosexual youtubers and I have subscribed to them. They have a good point and honestly I have become really inspired by them not because I am homosexual but I realize that if I was it should be fine. I want everyone to start to respect homosexuals more because it isn't fair to make these kind of comments about them when this is who they are. Please take the time to watch the following videos.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsjOlsG9Z...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8S2ZkLGl...  (this one is how people translate the bible (christian) to be against homosexuals)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rNOJ_vYJ...  (this is a video was made for homosexuals but it does have a point for all people)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lkuJQuVb...  (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WATCH THE REST ITLEAST WATCH THIS ONE AND THE NEXT ONE PLEASE! does curse sorry...but really good meaning)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPftbb21K...  (PLEASE WATCH THIS ONE IT REALLY HAS A GOOD POINT)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqdtlUDui...  (Does curse but the point is they are who they are and they wouldn't be them if they weren't gay)   *Note- I was going to post another video but I thought it focused more on religon is wroung then fixing religon. The thing is people are altering christinity and someother religons to go against homosexuals as well as other people when in fact there really is no meaning behind it and we need ot except other for who they are not judge them. Would jesus, or buhda, or anyother legacy/prophet be ashamed of being gay or would they embrase it ? Ask yourself that....       Point- the point of this video is to show you that using words like 'gay' and 'lesbo' as a bad thing is hurtful to nice people and we shouldn't judge them for a personal preference in men or women. Please try to refrain from bashing on them because I know we ALL have done it weather it be a simple comment or a speach to make people think that it is bad I want us all to try out best to STOP these hurtful things once and for all! Please stand by me on this weather you or my friend or someone who I might not even know this is a problem and YOU can help fix it.        I'm ASKING- Please keep this messege going around so that we can stop it or at least make a difference. Nothing bad is going to happen if you don't excluding you being the cause of more hurt to the people who belong to the gay,lesbian,transexual, and biasexual community. Please forward this and please try to make a difference because it is a problem and it is a form of discrimination just like racisim! Both need to stop and you can help stop it so why not!         yes this was an email and for those of you who are completely for it please email this to everyone you know because it is important!

Get taliban voodoo dolls which we would sting with needles and finally burn, and curse all taliban's filthy ideals and beliefs..?      3. Simply stay relatively passive, and just make great a wish that very pleasant gifts from Allah, such as Black Death and Ebola, (true wrath from God) will kill all taliban baboons to extinction..?

20090305015151AAN2Vfe	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Why do older people assume that young people like "hip hop" etc?	Just wondering, because so often older people assume that people my age (in their teens) like hip hop, pop, and rock.      In my experience, they do. But there are exceptions, myself being one. I mean I like Jazz and Classical.      I find that older people often don't take me seriously in conversations about music, and think that my opinions about classical music are uneducated. It annoys me but I can understand it, but honestly why do older people assume that young people like "hip hop" ???

Before my time, kids in school were oppressed for being left-handed, and forced to become right-handed.

To you I'm confessin,   the woulds have been dressed and the load has been lessoned.      I'm floating away I'm leaving it all,   whoever knew I could get so far   flying high into space as I continue to chase   these shooting stars around me I am finally in my place.   I'm orbiting planets, I'm circling Mars.   There's no better place than high above the stars.   Better than money, bitches, and cars.   Everybody said that I wouldn't get far   but I'm proving them wrong   I'm saying adios, sayonara, so long.   I've been waiting a while, I'm finally leaving.   I'm now an alien not a human being.

20090305021712AAipkj6	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Will Capricorn male respond to my messages...?	... if/when he finds out that I am now single?      OK, this is the situation - I had a close male Capricorn friend for the last 3 years, while I was in a serious live-in relationship. When Uni finished last year, I tried to stay in touch with him as I knew my relationship was coming to an end (I never spoke about this with Capricorn guy) and I really wanted to have a relationship with him as I thought I'd fallen in love with him, and I was pretty sure he was interested in me too.      But he has been ignoring my emails and texts, even though I am now single and living alone... I think he's doing this because I wasn't available and it was maybe too hard on him to continue being friends with me.      I really, really want to see him again, but I don't want to say straight out 'I'm single now' because that will make it obvious that I think I know why he's been avoiding me. And of course there's a chance he's been avoiding me for other reasons (he got sick of our friendship, he never liked me much after all lol)... I don't really want to sound desperate either, or like I broke up with my boyfriend becuase of him, because I didn't.      Is this how Capricorn deals with things - eg cutting people off who may hurt them, being extremely cautious and sensible etc? Do I have to spell it out to him that I am now single, available and REALLY want to hang out with him again - and how will he react to that, if he's interested?

20090305011554AA5KliK	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	American Idol:  Did anyone else notice the taping goof up on Lil Rounds?	So I know the show is way staged, but I just have to ask this!  When she sang "Be Without You" by MJB, she made the last verse her own and said "call this show if you just can't be without me" and put her hand up to her ear like a phone.  On the recap, it shows her singing (in the same outfit and background) the original verse that MJB sings.  I don't get it?  There's an audience in both of them.  Did they really make her re-record it?  Or during practice, is there an audience?  Gives me yet another reason not to like the show, yet I still continue to watch it!

Does anyone have any ideas as to how I could remedy the situation?    I have Vista, the adobe flash program thing. Nothing I have should be preventing me from watching because I used to watch them but now I just can't. I see a black box, some load bar flashes for less than a second, then it just stays black and nothing happens.       Help?

20090305003300AAnZ2jd	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Why do people hate Guitar Hero and Rock Band?	I don't understand why many real guitar players hate Guitar Hero and Rock Band, the two have almost nothing in common.       They claim that kids who play Guitar Hero act like they can play real guitar, but I've yet to meet someone like that. They say with all the time you spent playing on expert you could instead learn real guitar. It took me about a month to get good on expert, real guitar takes years of practice to be good at. Now I'm not saying that learning real guitar is a waste of time, but some people don't have the time or patience to really dedicate their time to learning the guitar      There are many other things I can list that differentiate Guitar Hero and real guitar, so can someone explain why there is so much hate for games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

20070325173353AAyV86l	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Posso definire Bruce Willis un Mostro Sacro del cinema?	Ho sempre sentito nominare come mostro sacro attori come Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Steve McQuinn, John Wein (o come si scrive) e molti altri, ma quasi mai (forse giusto una volta) ho sentito dire da qualcuno dire che Bruce Willis è un mostro sacro del cinema.   Secondo me sì, lo è, ha fatto molti film, di cui molti belli, ha un bel curriculum , insomma io penso che è uno dei più bravi attori del mondo, certo senza escludere Al Pacino e molti altri attori di gran rispetto, vai a vedere Forest Whitaker, Kevin Spacey, Kiefer Sutherland, Christopher Walken e moltissimi altri, ma di Bruce Willis non ne sento parlare molto, sento più parlare di attori di vecchia data, tipo John Wahine, Steve McQuinn ecc.   Quindi per farla breve, Bruce Willis secondo voi può rientrare nella categoria di attori di cui si ritiene mostri sacri del cinema? O forse non è così famoso come pensavo?

20090305032219AAJDy5r	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Soap-operas/sit-coms; Do they help people (in UK) broach difficult issues, or turn some into 'copy-cats'?	Just watched the latest episode of Shameless, and expressed horror at the 'punishment' Patrick (heroin seller) is receiving from Maureen (mother of daughter who dies on account of heroin sold to her by Patrick), by tying him down to a bed in her home, and feeding him heroin, obviously until he's had enough to suffer cold turkey...Shameless may not be as sharp as it first was, but still knocks the spots of current soaps/sit-coms for the time being.     Just wondering, however - will the UK undergo a 'public punishment' craze on account of the last programme, in a '...the police does nowt, so I'll do it messen'? Perhaps not - but England has form, with people who's watched plots in soaps and likewise programmes, only to feature in the front page of a 'red-top' on their way to court/jail.

20090305025230AABNmUO	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A bit long, but you may like it.?	SNIFFER DOG.           A man had just settled into his seat next to the window on the plane when another man sat down in the aisle seat and put his black Labrador retriever in the middle seat next to the man.          The first man looked very quizzically at the dog and asked why the dog was allowed on the plane.           The second man explained that he was a DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENT and that the dog was a 'sniffing dog'.        'His name is Sniffer and he's the best there is. I'll show you once we get airborne, when I put him to work.'           The plane took off, and once it was levelled out, the agent said, 'Watch this.' He told Sniffer to 'search.'           Sniffer jumped down, walked along the aisle, and finally sat very purposefully next to a woman for several seconds.        Sniffer then returned to his seat and put one paw on the agent's arm.           The agent said, 'Good boy', and he turned to the man and said, 'That woman is in possession of marijuana, so I'm making a note of  her seat number and the authorities will apprehend her when we land.           'Say, that's pretty neat,' replied the first man.           Once again, the agent sent Sniffer to search the aisles.        The lab sniffed about, sat down beside a man for a few seconds, returned to its seat, and this time he placed two paws on the agent's arm.           The agent said, 'That man is carrying cocaine, so again, I'm making a note of his seat number for the police.'           I like it!' said his seat mate.           The agent then told Sniffer to 'search' again..           Sniffer walked up and down the aisles for a little while,  sat down for a moment, and then came racing back to the agent, jumped into the middle seat and proceeded to **** all over the place.           The first man was really grossed out by this behaviour and couldn't figure out how or why a well-trained dog would behave like that, so he asked the agent, 'What's going on?'           The agent nervously replied, 'He just found a bomb.'

My current drum teacher is a great drummer and a nice guy and he knows me well. But, he often loses complete confidence in me and doesn't think I can play anything, so I can never move on.  Its not because I don't practice, he has just known me since I was a beginner and I can't seem to break out of that mold.  He acts like this sometimes, and other times he is great, but since I do want to go to music school, I don't know if it is worth it to stay with him, or should I find someone that sees my time as more worthwhile? He's a great drummer and he has known me for a long time, so he knows how I learn, but maybe that is the problem? i don't know what to do...

20090305022442AAniBgG	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Custom building my own electric guitar out of Fender & no-name parts; already got my pickups, now I need help!?	I basically gutted an agathis body from one of those Starcaster by Fender? Strat Pack starter kits you see at Costco and Guitar Center.  Before I did anything, I swapped out the Swinger-style neck (pointed headstock) for a nice Strat maple neck with Kluson tuners.  Then I installed a Fender Custom Shop '56 Strat Relic bridge ...but anyway, here is my question, as I've never built a guitar before:      Originally, the guitar had three single coil pickups (SSS) and some no-name pots, only one of which--the volume--actually did anything.  So, I tossed all that stuff and decided to put in a couple of humbuckers, making it an HSH design!      I have a DiMarzio Super Distortion for the bridge, DiMarzio PAF for the neck, and a DiMarzio DP119 Class of '55 single coil for the middle position.  But what I'm wondering is what kind of pots to use for this pickup combination.  Should I install 250K pots?  Why?  500K?  Why?  I'm not even clear on what the differences are, so ANY help would be greatly appreciated.      Thanks,      Rock on!

I just want to know what you guys think...I'll probably record it later tonight, but I just wanted some feedback first. Thanks!      We call and we call, this all said in tones   Like jewels on fingers cast over bones   Ice melting fast from her fingertips   Like ice-bergs looming o’er abandoned ships      What is cold and brittle turns to mush   What once was just oatmeal, now a burning bush   The heat of things once before said   Always glowing, never quite read      Leaving scores marked under the skin   To tell the tales of all ancient sin   But watch the north meld into east   And bake your bread with all the yeast      To make this rise and become significant   To make this sunset more magnificent   Rhyme your day into the ground   Run the animals to the pound      And day by day we go about   Running, running, we’ll stop to shout   Help! The embers are smoldering out!   Look! The belief is covered with gout!      Sponge it away, sponge it away   Connect with another upon golden hay   Feel chests pounding just like a drum   Don’t you dare stop yet, no not till you’re done      I have this passion, this burning desire   To attempt to forget all the words of this liar   Now, Jesus broke bread, got drunk on some wine   You call him savior as he healed the blind      I call him fiction to settle my soul   Believing the truth will create a much bigger hole   Make no mistake there is a search party searching   And down in the bough a sailor is lurching      Forward to save a half-drunken maiden   Who calls herself Ruby and dines with her satan   We call and we call, this all said in tones   Like jewels on fingers cast over bones      Like jewels on fingers cast over bones

BUT   Time and tide wait for no man.      The pen is mightier than the sword.   BUT   Actions speak louder than words.      Wise men think alike.   BUT   Fools seldom differ.      The best things in life are free things..   BUT   There's no such thing as a free lunch.       Slow and steady wins the race.   BUT   Time waits for no man.      Look before you leap.   BUT   Strike while the iron is hot.      Do it well, or not at all.   BUT   Half a loaf is better than none.      Birds of a feather flock together.   BUT   Opposites attract.      Don't cross your bridges before you come to them.    BUT   Forewarned is forearmed.      Doubt is the beginning of wisdom.   BUT   Faith will move mountains.      Great starts make great finishes.   BUT   It ain't over 'till it's over.      Practice makes perfect.   BUT   All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.      Silence is golden.   BUT   The squeaky wheel gets the grease.      You're never too old to learn.   BUT   You can't teach an old dog new tricks      What's good for the goose is good for the gander.    BUT   One man's food is another man's poison.      Absence makes the heart grow fonder.   BUT   Out of sight, out of mind.      Too many cooks spoil the broth.   BUT   Many hands make light work.      Hold fast to the words of your ancestors.    BUT   Wise men make proverbs and fools repeat them.

WHAT THE HELL. I didnt know Mr. Tall was asian!? Sure, Ken is a good actor, but get out of town! And John C. Riley as Mr. Crepsley!!! Oh get out!! Now!! Worst casting decision ever!! I always envisaged Crepsley as this really genuine, decent, trustworthy, kind person/vampire that comes out as being a bit abrasive at the start. I had a completely differenent face for that character. And they've associated him with John C. Riley!?? Bugger off!! He doesnt even suit the role at all!!! I just hope this film doesnt tarnish the books. I will definitely see it. I hope my current opinions are changed though after I see the film. I hope I'm wrong...      Anyways, what are your thoughts on this? Please, feel free to talk about any aspect of this upcoming film. Not just what I've said.

I heard it on the radio recently, and it sounds like an alternative band. It's not that gym class hero song everyone keeps telling me. Its a real mellow song, they played it in the bowling alley today 3/5/09! It doesn't neccessarily say that, but I know it sounds like they are saying " We're gonna have a good time" and the music video has people sitting around (i think is what i saw).

20090305031757AA8qWRu	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Find photos, article's etc re: uk jeans designer peter golding and his colleague and companion, april de silva?	Hi,  My question is re: a web site (www.petergolding.com).  I went to visit his site, I was not mentioned for my considerable contributions to his achievments, as well not even acknowledged at all for the colaborative endeavors we did together.  but it seems that (though i have hard copy's of each and every remark and product contained in his site) he has mis represented himself on the internet and that I believe is fraud and it hurt. I  was very instrumental in creating his dreams come trues during the period we were together.  I was about to invite him to be a guest on my new up-coming radio/TV/CD/Concerts for honoring unsung hero's, new iconic trend setting talent and on my special events fund raiser concerts for the children and adults of Indigo nature, special gifts, as well as for justice for all who are slipping through the cracks, being taking advantage of, abused and used.  I have already a well of other super stars who will be on hand to support this very global worthy series of events. So, I was compelled to look deeply into what was said on his site and to congratulate him on his recognition for being a pioneer in his field of expertize, by HH Queen Elizabeth II.  But, now I am dis-illusioned, who ever wrote the contents on his site, never gave credit and mentioned what we did so successfully together as well as with others of royal status, for the voiceless and for giving hope and finally, on behalf of Former HRH The Princess Diana and her favored charities at an event I co-hosted at the royal albert hall and was going to put that up on the show an example of dreams come true.   It was to do something inspirational together for humanity and to raise awareness and inspire the children-adults of autistic, Indigo and special needs that they too have a special gift to share with out being thretened by preditors, but now, it will be embarrasing for him and wouldn't end up thinking about it now..  Please, I need some feed back as there are so many in need of hope and dreams come true and I have been so blessed but this is in direct conflict to the products/film/cd's/photos/ and letters he just wrote for my son and mother and I will save all contents of this and his site and print them up for the records .  My motivation is to share these products in my performance along with others in lectures/radio/uso for the troops and TV reality for raising awarness to the above I champion and for raising funds.  What kind of message does this send to these precious little ones and their families...how to proceed...I know the lawyer route but would be happier if these were all retractions and apologies as I have already sent people to visit his site and now must make a comment or look a fool or out of touch, much less put others in harms way un-inentionaly.  It is fraudulant and abusive.  Aloha A

Hey everyone, looking for the name of this anime, one of my firsts. Actually I think it may have been an American short film. All I can remember of it is there were mecha's, not really focused on them though actually not a whole lot of fighting all and all in the series but I believe some sort of war is going on around them. Would have been made sometime in the 90's      The key scene I remember is it doesn't show much during the scene but two security guards have to stripsearch a report before she's allowed to get onto her train.      Any help would be great thanks

20060925190030AAm6ZzJ	Entertainment & Music;Music	Do you think that rappers like Yung Joc or Young Dro will have longevity in hip hop?	A co worker of mine and I had a debate so to speak. I told him that I really can't see Yung Joc or Dro for example having longevity in hip hop as oppose to someone like Common or a new face like Lupe Fiasco. Why? Because in my opinion I think Yung Joc makes music for the mainstream. You know the type of people who like whats hot now. Secondly he is lyrically inferior. He has no substance to what he's saying. The music is not creative whatsoever. He's doing what everybody else is doing. Now I could be wrong but artist this horrid usually fall off in a year or two. Lupe on the other hand is pure lyricism. His album touch on an array of topics and the music is creative. Therefore I could see him being around for a while. I could be wrong as well with him. But he seems like he cares about the culture of hip hop and the music. The way corporation beat us over the head with all this garbage is not good for hip hop. There's no balance which is sad. What do you think?

I have been searching for this video since like 2000. My sister said the band was someone named Heartland, Black hawk, Ricochet, or Confederate Railroad; but I think I watched all of there videos and none of them seem to be the artist. It was also a band, a guy band, not just one singer.

Un giorno Il Presidente del Consiglio Silvio Berlusconi tornando ad Arcore con la sua splendida Mercedes, con tanto di autista in livrea, si trova imbottigliato nel traffico...    Ad un certo punto dice all'autista: "Gira in quella stradina di campagna, una scorciatoia che facevo da ragazzo..." Subito l'autista gira nella stradina, quando un maiale attraversa la strada, l'autista frena, ma non riesce ad evitare l'animale che per fortuna muore sul colpo.    Allora Berlusconi si rivolge all'autista dicendo: "Vai subito in quella cascina, racconta al contadino quello che è successo e chiedi quanto dobbiamo dargli di risarcimento...".    L'autista corre verso la cascina...Un'ora pi tardi, vede ritornare l'autista altalenante, con un sigaro in bocca ricoperto di regali: vino,prosciutti, salami, verdura, formaggi, latte fresco, uova e chi piu' ne ha piu' ne metta... e i vestiti tutti stropicciati.   - Be'...

Ci farò una recensione sul film giusto per levarmi quei peli sullo stomaco, perchè a mio parere poteva uscire un ottimo movie.   Comunque qui dirò solo una cosa: ma Terry Gillian sapeva di cosa parlava?   Non bisogna essere consumatori di droga per sapere che la cocaina provoca euforia e galvanizza; mentre è l'eroina "ad addormentare". Per lui sembra facciano lo stesso!   Ma non poteva farsi una botta di cocaina giusto per essere "competente" a riguardo?   A parte qst (che non è una provocazione; un regista deve sapere di cosa parla nel suo film) bastava farsi un giro su internet, chiedere ad uno sballato, ma poi tutto il mondo è paese e le conoscono anche i bambini le differenze tra queste droghe... ma si può??!

20070430181628AA3j2Lt	Entertainment & Music;Music	What is a good romantic piano solo that I should play?	Okay, I've been playin' piano for a year now.  It's not as long as some of you out there, but I consider myself one of the better ones in my class.  I mean, I can play "The Entertainer (with 2-finger chords)" and Bach's "Menuet" and some other pieces.  Well, anyway, disregard that.      For our final exam, we get to choose our own song to play on the piano.  Now there is a girl in my class that'd I'd like to impress/woo.  What song should I play?  Give me some names and songs.  Don't worry about my skill level.  I enjoy playin' the piano and if I put myself to it, I'm sure I can do it.  And anyway, I'll see the music before I purchase it or watever and I'll decide on the difficulty.  So let me hear'em.
