20080708221901AAk1w2G	Pets;Dogs	Mastiff pup is very fearfull, begining to show aggression, what to do?	She is an english mastiff, 5 months old, had her from 9 wks. From the start she was scared of everything. She did warm up to the family but for a long time she keep to herself. I have been doing a lot to socialize her, walks 3 times a week, weekly trip to pet store, visits to my parents, parks. For a long time she walked behind me but she is finally walking correctly on a leash. Now she is getting more defensive with strangers, snapping at people. My 15 year old teen son left to go to his g-mas for 2 wks and when he came home she tried to bite his hand. Is it just who she is? Is there no changing her? How do I take the fear away? I believe she is going to be dangerous when she gets big and I have tried SO HARD to prevent that! I have an apt with a trainer next week, I dont know if the trainer can help her or not, Heres a pic  http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e46/bo...    all advice welcome!!!

I have a solid grazing/shank bit and every time I slip the bridle over her ears she yanks her head up with her teeth clamped and the bit in her mouth.  Sometimes she starts backing up too.  It's like she's scared of it or something.  It normally takes me a few minutes to get her to take the bit, but after it's in she's just fine.  I know she has a wolf tooth, and I'm working on getting the vet out to file it.  What do you think is going on?

20081107120546AAtc3iv	Pets;Horses	Building a round pen and closed arena?	I'm considering building a round pen but I don't know if I should have a  round pen with wooden panels so the horse can't see out and only concentrate on me or just a regular pen with panels. Which one do you think would benefit the most or work the best?   Example of wooden round pen -   http://www.ivyacreshorsefarm.com/uploads...    Example of plain panels -  http://www.villatraining.ca/images/Large...    Right now I have an open arena that works really well with my barrel horse, but I have a yearling that I would like to ride in reining and I think I would probably need to build a fence around my arena for stops, and turn-backs. But he's only a yearling so I think I have a couple of years until I get into that advanced stuff, I just want to plan ahead.   Could I just use a 60ft round pen to work some reining maneuvers or do you think I should just add the fence and find a different place to work barrels with my horse?   -Thanks a lot for answering!
20081028190357AAhcIVN	Pets;Horses	How do you cue for the canter?	I have heard of two ways:   Move outside leg behind girth, squeeze outside rein, squeeze both legs and ask verbally for canter.     I have also heard of doing the same thing but using the inside rein.     The reasons are this- for using the outside rein, it pushes the horses 'active' shoulder out, opening him up to be able to accept the lead.     Conversely,  Using the inside rein is used because it sets the horse up into a frame that mimics a circle which encourages the horse to pick up the correct lead naturally.        My green horse picks up the correct lead every time on the longe and he is bent to the inside, should I teach him to canter under saddle by bending him to the inside?

20081007152033AADi5YK	Pets;Other - Pets	Sabia que o cancer em animais...?	Tem CURA??   Essa "pergunta" é destinada as pessoas que tem animais de estima??o com "caro?os"... Ví várias pessoas falando aqui : meu gato tá com tumores há 3 anos.. meu cachorro tem carocinhos há 1 ano e n?o levei no vet por medo...   Pelo amor de Deus...    Bom, algumas informa??es;      1- nem todo caro?o é cancer. Pode ser inflama??o , cisto, tumor benigno...Só o vet pode saber o que é.      2- existem vários tipos de cancer... carcinomas,hemangiossarcomas, osteossarcomas, sarcomas... centenas.. cada 1 tem um tratamento diferente. Nem todo animal com cancer morre!! Muitos sobrevivem ( geralmente aqueles que tiveram dignóstico precoce).      3- " se operar o cancer espalha" : já vi muitas dessa... primeiro... nem todo cancer faz metástase ( crescimento em outros locais) ; segundo, qto mais tempo esperar para diagnosticar e tratar maior a chance dele se espalhar pelo corpo; terceiro: fa?a a cirurgia num vet confiável... durante a cirurgia ele deve ficar atento a margem cirurgica ( se n?o retirar a margem tem grandes chances dele voltar). é melhor pagar mais caro do que levar em um "a?ougue" e n?o resolver.      4-NUNCA confie num vet que dá o diagnóstico apenas olhando para o animal... na faculdade n?o temos matérias de mediunidade e interpreta??o por bola de cristal...para saber exatamente o que é ( o tratamento correto depende disso) só com exames de análise de células ( citologia e histopatologia). Se o vet olhou e deu o diagnóstico, procure outro!      5- Qualquer  "carocinho" deve ser examinado. Se apareceu um em seu animal, procure um vet o mais rápido possivel. Qualquer um sabe que quanto mais rápida a interven??o, maiores as chances de sucesso no tratamento. Se ficar esperando ele vai crescer e corre o risco de ulcerar ( e infeccionar, dar bicheira...) e/ou se espalhar pelo corpo.      6- existem medicamentos para o cancer. Muitos tipos de cancer n?o podem ser operados ( localiza??o) ou devem receber tratamento quimioterápicoo associado. Se o vet retirou um tumor, mande para a análise e depois de descoberto o que é pergunte sobre os protocolos de quimioterapia para esse tipo de cancer. A chance de sucesso é maior.         Informem-se sobre isso!! N?o deixem seus animais definharem por causa do cancer para procurar ajuda... isso é no mínimo crueldade com ele!      boa noite a todos!

I ride him at the barn that’s he’s staying at to get sold, and he’s a hunter jumper, so he likes to go fast and he gets frisky when he sits for a while, like he bucks.lol the fist time I rode him he bucked me off....um. He’s really sweet but loves  treats so he is a little nippy just with his lips and also he chews wood (so obviously the seller lied.lol). he dives his corners and leans real bad. But I still love him, if I had 12500 dollars id buy him in a heartbeat.   So my question is do you really think he’s worth $12,500? I personally don’t think so...but I also haven’t ridden a expensive horse like that so I wouldn’t know really…if you don’t think he’s worth 12500 then how much would you pay for him?      if you need more information just ask and ill tell you.   thank you!

She's 14hh and of a good weight, how much do you think i just feed her?      I was thinking 1/2 - 1 scoops of nuts and im not sure how much chaff i would need to put with this.

20081012184242AAcE0Lr	Pets;Horses	Question about show horses?	I have worked with trail and ranch horses for nearly 30 years... recently I bought a former show horse....this is the second show horse I have bought.    I had the exact same problems with the first one as I am having with this one... The first one I finally sold out of frustration. The person I sold him to shows horses and got on him and rode him around with no problem.    I know these horses are trained differently.     I cant lead this horse. when I try to lead him it turns into a tug of war. and when I get on his back we have a nice long sit. any of the normal incentives I give seems to just confuse him.       my question is. Are there special commands to use get get him to walk forward? is there a special way to hold the lead when walking him?       my other horses walk with a lead without me even having to tug on the line. and when i get on their back all i have to do is give the reins a shake and their off.      are there any special techniques or commands for show horses?    I have tried everything exept smacking him up side the head.

So I need to get back in tip top riding shape as well.  But I do ride her bareback trotting and jogging.        Heres the question when I was in the round pen we took off into a canter did two laps  and the rhythm felt nice i was in tune with her.       but when I asked her to stop she did so very rapid and I about came out my saddle In fact I bounced off and onto her neck ....lol ..........not good . We are training in english she was western but because of past abuse she hates the western saddle.  I can trot her all day long bareback beautifully .       so is this a problem with me and balance in english,  her not stoping light and collected.  or a combo of the two.

I found myself in the backyard trying to get his attention, and shaking a bag of steak and decided this is nuts, there has to be a better way.  Meanwhile, both my labs are sitting at my feet slobering all over.  Did I mention that hes approx 2 1/2 -3, and I just had him fixed 2 weeks ago.  I dont think that he is stupid, I beleive that there are no stupid dogs, just owners that dont take the time.  But Ive been at this for 6 weeks now with no progress.  If I could plug his nose, I  might just have a chance.  Ive trained many dogs, but Iv used every trick I have in my book, and need some help from someone who is familiar with this breed. He is a sweet boy, and I will end up keeping him, but for my sanity, I need to train him.  Did I mention that classes didnt work either. HELP

20070212124539AANTkdf	Pets;Dogs	How do you fill the void?	I have had my dog for three years and he struggles with food aggression. Went through all the training with him but since I moved into my own place (break-up) he has gotten worse. I can no longer fulfill his needs as I am not home for half of the day and his behavior keeps getting worse. I have decided to return him to the shelter where I got him. This is going to be very painful, this separation. How do you get through this?

Fui até uma dessas pet shops porcas,e vi que no cantinho da gaiola,tinha apenas um hamster, jururu.   Perguntei ao rapaz se só tinha aquele,só para testar mesmo.E ele me disse que sim,pois ninguém quis comprar.Ent?o eu pedi para que ele tirasse o bichinho da gaiola,pois eu compraria,ele falou que era melhor eu esperar,que chegariam mais,eu disse que queria aquele.Foi quando ele me disse que o hamster n?o tinha uma das patas.O povo é mesquinho demais.><'   E diante disso,quero proporcionar a minha filhota uma vida digna,ela tem uma casa linda,comida,água e muito carinho.Mas assim como nós humanos,ela precisa de adapta??es,vendo que ela sente dificuldades ao passear na rodinha.E o ferimento é recente ainda sangra.

20070721053239AAnYy4Y	Pets;Other - Pets	Is there any images or film of chinchillas in their natural habitat?	I am finding it hard to find anything that shows chinchillas in the wild. There is nothing! I have never even seen a TV nature documentary which has shown chinchillas in the wild (c'mon the BBC get your act together!).      This is a bit of a challenge, have a look on google and see for yourself. Not much is known about chinchillas let alone their home environment in the Andes mountains in South America. I am really curious to know more about their natural environment as I keep chinchillas as pets. It would be great to see pictures or a video even of a wild chinchilla community.      So if anyone has any images or videos please let me know or give me a link to a website so I can check it out.

20071118074938AApKSXq	Pets;Dogs	My dog has to go out and pee every 30 minutes?	He does not have a urinary tract infection, for sure because i checked the signs for it and he has none.   He is a 5 year old American Eskimo/ Border collie and recently has been whining to go out every 30 minutes! He never has done this before.    NO i am not one of those people who say "i cant afford a vet" I will take him to the vet if i need to. So what i would like to know is, has anybody ever experienced this before? And does anyone know what it is? Or shall i just go to the vet.      OH and nobody yell at me for "Neglecting" my dog for not taking him to the vet yet. I dont need it thankyou.

I had my lesson today and my instructer said that the inexperianced horse i was riding responds to me by being more forward going then with anyone else. He said it is called an 'elelctric bum' lol well i was just wondering if this is a bad way the horse responds to me? is there something i am doing wrong (i have been riding for 8 years but had to stop for over a year and a half til now due to illness) so it is not as if i am a complete novice i just need to get back into the 'swing'. do you think this is a positive thing or not? thank you :D

20080619023332AAHgeZp	Pets;Horses	What do you guys think of these horse quotes?	Look back at our struggle for freedom,   Trace our present day's strength to it's source;   And you'll find that man's pathway to glory   Is strewn with the bones of the horse.   ~Author Unknown         It takes a good deal of physical courage to ride a horse.  This, however, I have.  I get it at about forty cents a flask, and take it as required.  ~Stephen Leacock         Feeling down?  Saddle up.  ~Author Unknown         A horse which stops dead just before a jump and thus propels its rider into a graceful arc provides a splendid excuse for general merriment.  ~Duke of Endinburgh         Small children are convinced that ponies deserve to see the inside of the house.  ~Maya Patel         In my opinion, a horse is the animal to have.  Eleven-hundred pounds of raw muscle, power, grace, and sweat between your legs - it's something you just can't get from a pet hamster.  ~Author Unknown

20081106171815AAoxPqZ	Pets;Fish	Picky Betta Fish. Suggestions?	My male Betta fish is a picky eater. He will not eat the pellets he just spits them out and doesnt like the flakes. I've tried blood worms since he will not eat anything else. I've read that it is not good just to feed him blood worms. Is there anything suggestions on what to feed him that I haven't tried. It might be the brand of food I've tried feeding him. I've been trying to feed him topfin color enhancing betta bites and he just doesnt like them. I never had a fish as picky as him.
