YtchcjVdaa	If you've been going out with him for not that long i would get rid, you don't need someone who flirst with other girls and only holds you;r hand and kisses you as he pleases in privacy, you'r not a doormmat. you can do better.<br>  If you have been going out with him a while then talk to him..theres no harm..|`|wqCznap2aa	yeah, he's just not that into you, just keeping you for the meantime till he finds someone else. Don't let him break your heart. Just break up with him.|`|mRZ6Z1O3aa	If you don't believe him and you have no trust for him,yes break up with him..and if that's his ex and she's saying she loves him and he says she doesn't mean anything,believe that,that's why she's an ex..trust me get away from him..but before you do..try and kiss him in person..if he doesn't go with it leave his ***.|`|leKt5XqSaa	You should break up with him i mean if he doesn't even wanna act like your boyfriend in public then whats the point. And that ex of his is probably more than what hes telling you don't be blind and move on. You can do better ;]|`|EAlc2Sw1aa	Ya im good at this stuff and my answer is YES!

0p6fMWsDaa	NOOO!!! Do not go out with him. He obv knows both you and the other girl fancy him, and is just loving all the attention, and soaking up the oppurtunity as it probs never happens to him. I dont think he has feelings for the other girl but does for you, and knows that he can get some fun out of the other girl as she is his ex. He also sounds like he is using you when this ither girl isnt around, as if your second best, yet he fancies you. How do your other friends feel? If they dont like him and also think that he is using you and abit of a player, then i wouldnt as they probs see it from a different view to you, as they dont fancy him and see all good, whereas you possibly would. To answer your question, i wouldnt go with him, you sound like a lovely girl who can get any guy she wants, so dont settle for him, you can get better then him.|`|hTT8DhYfaa	he's playin you both. show your friend the texts .. NOT TO BRAG but be like OMG i like him sooo much. and if she says, nu uh hes muh man! and thinks he likes her.. yea. dump that playa<br>  <br>  or trick him and be like. lets go to the movies and both of u show up. he'd be like.. OH GOSH!<br>  <br>  <br>  lol good luck|`|Lzk24WGcaa	Yes. go out with him.|`|T20lVPDkaa	no dont go out with him. thats crap! he clearly still likes her sorry. I wouldnt want to go out with someone who is not fully into me. and its been how long?! geeze. dont waste your time. and plus, who goes out with their best friends ex?? ouch.. and since he liked you and thats the reason they broke up that must have been crapy for your friend. to go out wit him would make matters worse|`|TU34il8Taa	yes date him becuz then u can tell if he likes u or his friend nymore and considering that ur friend still like him ask her 1st since u like him so much give him a chance|`|Bv5dJQMFaa	go out with him girl!|`|ek1193Qiaa	he sounds like a playa. I wouldn't go out with him because he sounds like he wants to ruin you and your friends relationship. You have done the right thing by not going out with him because you could be going out with him and he might be flirting with some other girl with the name of Sasha (just some random name). If your friend has feelings for him and you have feelings for him then don't go out with him because she could become really mad at you and be very jealous or she could get really sad and depressed. So just tell him to lay off and that you don't want to go out with him.|`|mRZ6Z1O3aa	NO.<br>  I don't even have to read the rest.<br>  There are simply two reasons why you shouldn't date him. <br>  First he was with your best friend and fantasizing about you? <br>  what makes you think he wont do that to you? and think of another girl. he's a jerk..do you really think he's worth risking your friendship? think of your friends feelings,than you should get the answer.. and 2nd She still likes him,come on girl ! wake up!!!!!!!|`|leKt5XqSaa	I think you shouldn't go out with him i mean if he really liked you and didn't have feelings for his ex he would act the same way with you while shes there and not just flirt with you through a text.|`|j3ccnXhIaa	Yeah, you could try it, but don't get too into him straight away (or try not to)<br>  Maybe he's just shy to show his feelings about you to others, and his flirting with your friend is actually a disguise?|`|E0BE60p1aa	Yes. Talk to your friend first though. A similar thing happened to me. I'm still friends with her, and a year on, i'm still with him. Go for it x|`|P1EFw6z6aa	Do you like him?

AA10975867	On the first of May we signed the lease on our apartment for a move-in date on the 15th (our wedding was the 25th). I had given notice on my apartment and moved back home with my parents on the 1st of month. When we were together in those 3.5 weeks, we were busy arranging things, dropping off deposits, etc. and were limited to some very loving kisses as we said goodnight in the car. On our wedding night it was like the first time, absolutely firewroks and different from any other night from the past year. It is worth it!! For some reason, as much as you tell yourself that you are 100% committed, there is something about being actually married that opens all the floodgates!|`|6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	i dont know, sounds like it might just make you irritable. you'll probably not have a lot of sex before the wedding anyway, because you'll be so busy. but it can be a real tension breaker.<br>  i had also heard from many friends that they were so exhausted the night of the wedding, they were too tired for sex. i circumvented this by making love the morning of the wedding. it made my fiance and i feel close and cuddly, and it took off the pressure to have sex that night. and i can remember the last time i made love as a single woman|`|fNAU0OL6aa	my fiance and I lived together for a year and a half before we became engaged. We went to engagement counseling and was told that we couldnt have sex until the wedding night, which was 9 months away!!! We have slipped maybe a handful of times but for the most part have been strong. we have 3 months left but now im just thinking how great the honeymoon is going to be!!! It's extremely hard but I think it will be worth it.|`|BObu4i9saa	most of the people i know that lived together before they were married didn't end up having sex on their wedding nights (in fact i can't think of one couple i know that didn't just go home/to the hotel to sleep or pack for the honeymoon)<br>  i'm willing to bet that little separation will be what you need to really want it that night - no matter how tired you are from the big day|`|cGbTJobeaa	We didn't have sex for about the last 2 months before the wedding.  I thought it made the anticipation (and reality) of the wedding night more special.|`|AA11434429	We were a bit anxious about our first meeting with our minister, and were a bit ashamed that we had not done the right thing, and unsure how he would react upon hearing that we were sexually active. So in anticipation of this meeting, we talked it over and decided to stop having sex until the wedding. It has been about a month, and we have about 7 months to go. It has been hard (but if you don't tempt yourselves it makes it a lot easier). We are not frustrated or irritable though.<br>  <br>  Also, the minister never even asked about it.|`|IDlPFVNDaa	haha, that's a really good idea, I tell you, my fiance is in the military, and after 6 months of nothing its allot of fun. You will be so busy planning the wedding it shouldn't be to hard. But if it gets really frusturating have a lil fun, just dont go to sex.. tease, and play.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	We did that.  To be honest with you, those last 2-3 months before the wedding are incredibly busy so sex will be the last thing on your mind.  I say go for it--it builds a lot of anticipation and makes it worthwhile.
yAQJlblpaa	you could just tell her that your here for her when she wants to talk and that she should try not to be as stressed because she's taking it out on everyone. Tell her that you know it's not her fault and try and offer her ways on not to stress.|`|MTkUXfXgaa	you tell her how much you care and tell her you understand she is upset but you also have concerns about your friendship. ask her if there is something more you can do or what you have done in the past tot feel that way
K1oOQqqVaa	Make sure his insurance is paid up.|`|AA10389562	Potentially just another form of attempted manipulation.<br>  <br>  People who truly want to commit suicide are dead.  It's really not that difficult.<br>  <br>  Do what you can to make sure he has opportunity to seek professional help and then STAY AWAY!|`|oojO4WAraa	He may try blaming you for his suicide attempt - but that all falls on him.  He chose his actions.  You did not make him do that.  Don't play the guilt game.  He didn't treat you right but didn't want to change that.  I'm sure you spoke to him about it more than once.  He did this to himself.  It is not your fault.  <br>  <br>  Go seek counseling if it continues to bother you.  But - it is not your fault.|`|gWYArJ0Haa	He seems crazy.. you should get a restraining order on him and run away with your baby..|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You're  really between a rock and a hard place. I hope they kept in the hospital the mandatory 3 days and that after that he admitted himself voluntarily. That's what I did after I attempted suicide, but for an entirely different reason. I am really hesitant to give advice on matters of this importance. The only thing I do know is that you're not at fault. To me when a person attemts suicide and blames a spouse it's the same as saying I want to hand over my life to you and make you responsible for making me happy. An unrealestic demand to say the least and a burden no one can handle. I asked about parents, etc. to see if one of them could talk to him and tell him how personally it hurt them  to think he would do such a thing and leave them feeling gulty and, truth be told, mad at him. Suicide is the most selfish and hurtful thing a person can do to those who love him. He needs to know, in my unprofessional opinion ,that he wasn't   just hurting you, there are a lot more people involved. I assume and hope he is under some kind of psychartric care and for your sake, before you take anyone's adivce including mine, you should see a therapist to help you to handle this and as soon as possible. My gut tells me that if you come running he will have achieved his goal and figure it was a good plan or it could be the thing that tips him over the edge and next time he won't fail. Please get help in handling this, he has no right to punish you this way. My heart goes out to you and I wish I was able to tell you the right thing to do. Make an appointment with a therapist, tomorrow if possible.|`|htWw0OlCaa	I know you said you left because he was treating you badly, you did the right thing. Now he goes and does something stupid like that, and he wants to blame you... That's crazy!!!  That should give you all the more reason to stay away from him.|`|bf6K6uubaa	you can't make someone try to kill themselves its a hcoice they make themselves..trust me i wish i had that power sometimes but we dont. he needs help.  try to get him to go to a psychiatric hospital for an assessment.  other than that stay away from him..you left for a reason and your child doesnt need to be involved with that so do what you can but from a distance...rememeber its not your fault he chose to do it (or try to do it)|`|ANOvR67Gaa	Maybe he is just wanting attention. He probably thinks that if he tries that, then you will come back to him.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Why? Sounds like he is and continues to be a control freak and manipulator.  It's all about him.<br>  <br>  Too bad he didn't succeed - you would have gotten his Social Security.|`|45azZvL9aa	I'm going to be honest.<br>  <br>  It sounds like drama.<br>  <br>  Also, I want you to think about that baby.... Do you want that baby to have original parents or not?  When that baby has a child do you want to be nuclear grandparents.<br>  <br>  I don't think people think of the long term effects of divorce often.  They think of the NOW, and how life COULD be without, rather than trying to ever inkling of their being to work it out.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	If he seriously tried to kill himself, he is in a hospital right now.  Therefore, you need to do nothing.  Let his psychiatrist handle the situation.|`|6d6a92cfa24029ef82993ae689105908aa	You are not responsible for your ex's choices.  He is. He is trying to guilt you back into a relationship. DANGER DANGER DANGER.  you are responsible for your baby's safety. Get away from him he sounds very unstable. I repeat you are not to blame.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	actually, it is none of your business. he has to get help, but you have no part of it. just take care of your baby.|`|52332e62000ac0a2cad78200a89d809aaa	i agree with chris. get help, go to a friend, family, somebody, Police if it comes down to it.|`|1tiCB311aa	First of all, you can't blame yourself. I know you are scared, but don't feel guilty. Your ex needs to seek help from a mental health professional. If he was taken to the hospital, after his attempt, they will direct him to one. Suicide is often a cry for help. It will be mandatory for him to go. In most states it is against the law to do this and the police are also notified by the doctors. <br>  <br>  You can also look in your local phone book for numbers of centers that can help you. The suicide lines are for those who are attempting suicide, but they can also direct you to areas of help.|`|C59bTKO2aa	There is nothing you can or should do.  People that make suicide attempts and blame someone else are immature and need professional help.  If he was treating you badly and left, he is basically having a tantrum like a 2 year old.  He knows what he did was wrong but instead of acting like a man and taking responsibility for what he did and then trying to work out his problem. He acts like a child and blames you, if you have such guilt over something that you did not encourage, refer the guy to a psychologist and tell him unless he gets some help you don't want to talk to him again.|`|FXINmF6saa	He is definitely trying to manipulate you which will work unless you put a stop to it.  You need to let him know that you don't care what he does with himself and that you just want him to leave you alone. That will bring his spirit down and he won't try to commit suicide anymore because he'll know you won't care and you are not going to do anything about it. Anyone who tells you what he's going to do or tells you after he was going to do it means he really doesn't want to kill himself. He just wants to find a way to get your attention. Remember no one is indispensable and everyone can be replaced. As well as he found you he will find someone else. If he is telling you it's your fault he is obviously not worth even thinking about. Do yourself a favor and keep him away from you and your baby and if that doesn't work try a restriction order by the court. He is using his life as an excuse to keep you by his side. Just let him do it already if he's going to do it. Ignore him and don't show him it's working. Make sure he knows you took a decision and it's final.|`|DdJnmx7Laa	get him a psychiatrist|`|ecNeN0staa	Don't walk, RUN away from this disaster!|`|yW62Xm9caa	You did the right thing by leaving him because he had no right to treat you badly.It sounds like he just blames you and tried to kill himself so you would feel sorry for him and take him back.You definetly should think about getting him help because you never know he might be on drugs or something and the next thing you know he will try and hurt you!You should keep your baby in mind and dont do anything stupid.|`|B1MnNcI8aa	Move in with him and spend all your money, time & energy on him.  WAIT, I mean, stay away from him.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Well, wether you want to be with him or not you do have to show some type of support because he is your child's father.  That's a forever relationship.  <br>  <br>  You can be supportive but at a safe distance.  If it becomes over bearing don't answer your phone.  He has to learn how to deal with his own issues but checking up on him once a week is not so bad.|`|GDdTEEDZaa	get him some help , like now|`|yAvw79ohaa	He is trying to manipulate you, read below, God Bless<br>  <br>  <br>  Manipulators seek one thing: control. Anyone can be manipulative or manipulated: parents, lovers, spouses, friends, children, employers or employees. Because any relationship that involves manipulation is destined for problems, you need to recognize and deal with a manipulator for your own mental and emotional health.|`|IrquK9N6aa	Don't let him blame you. First, try to give him a big does of empathy. then I would give him the name and number of a local counseling center. Tell him you still care, just not the way a wife cares and tell him good luck. He is a big boy and needs to learn to handle life instead of trying to run.|`|vVWO9VW9aa	You should be scared. Get as far away from him as you can. He could be capable of doing anything. Go to the police and ask for help. You best to watch your back --- every move you make, because you never know where he stands. Be very careful.|`|eus7WqzUaa	It was a cry for help.  He needs to be committed.  Does he have a drug/drinking problem?<br>  <br>  Abusive people often do this.  He couldn't control you any longer so he did what he did.  Its not your fault.

Commiting suicide is very selfish even if it doesnt seem so at the time it can affect your babies life and yours if you love him.you should get someone to help you out... because you have more then you and him to think about, your child should have a father figure in his/her life.|`|8hrOJBEHaa	its a ploy to get you back.. and relationships will never survive on suicide attempts.<br>  <br>  Just walk away - do not ever feel that it is your fault for a stupid action that he has made - it is clearly him who is "committing suicide" and his inability to deal with your perspective. He will owe you child support whether he likes it or not.  DO NOT go back - it never works - ever.|`|4Po9PcJ6aa	Please get help. file a complaint and get a restraining order. He is just torturing you mentally. If he wanted to commit suicide he would have done it and not called you and told you about it. He is a psycho...|`|FnvYkF2Gaa	Get help.  Sounds like a bad situation, no offense but your husband sounds like a ******* idiot if he treated you badly, and then trys to kill himself because you left him.  He sounds selfish, get him help|`|YYAUr8t9aa	It's not your fault. It was his decision and his alone. I had an ex girlfriend who jumped off an 18th floor to her death because of our break up.

54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	Sorry but these words "she is adamant about spending the night at her friends. she wont even let me pick her up" should have you worried. Why the hell would a woman not allow her husband to pick her up? I would love to hear her explanation.|`|bf6K6uubaa	she is planning on being with someone else...thats obvious and you already know that.  she is probably young and wants to have a fling or meet up with an ex....she shoudl let you pick her up because she lives at home not at her friends house.  tell her that she can go out but that if she doesn't answer her phone you will go get her...dont call all crazy but call at around midnight then again at 2...but honestly she's up to something don't be fooled by the "needs time away" crap cause she doesn't need to be sleeping anywhere but home|`|iQqsdl5yaa	Well, if she is going out with her girlfriends for a night out, maybe she just wants to spend the night over their house because she does not want to rush the night and not worry about transporation after, that way she can drink until she cannot drive...I would not worry about.  If you trust her, why even worry!|`|YHcyuka3aa	Set a limit! She has no business staying at anyone else house without you. I think she is up to no good!|`|NEWbh3Plaa	That is weird.  Maybe you should be more persistent.  She might be worried that if she comes home she will have to get up with the baby.  Would it be possible for you to get a babysitter and you guys go out together?  If she wants a night with the girls, why not have a night with the boys and then all meet up together later?<br>  If none of that works, you might want to watch her a little closer.  Im not saying she is cheating, but it does sound fishy.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i wouldn't be worried unless you have other reason to be worried.  i don't have any kids, but i am married, but even my friends who do have kids, we can go out, and then cab it to someones place and continue the party there.(just a small group of girls)  then by the time it's all over we just sleep there, as there aren't that many hours left anyways.    i think it might be her way of not being woken up by the baby in the night, and if she is hung over in the am, it's best she not be at home with baby first thing anyways.|`|iPFUJXvpaa	tell her she cannot go out any more .unless it's with you ,cause you are her husband. single life is over ,she is going to far as to stay at her Friends house.just going out is not good enough for her it seems .maybe she should move back with her mommy & daddy until she grows up.GOOD LUCK BUDDY..|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Sounds like she just needs some time away. Why would you be worried?  Let her have her fun without you trying to put on the guilt trip.<br>  <br>  Seriously people?  And just why shouldn't any parent be allowed to spend a night without the kids?  Seriously?|`|POJNnWhDaa	I'd say fine, if you do that, then some other night of my choosing I get to do the same thing. See what she says to that.|`|SovaFpN8aa	She has a new baby, and wants to leave it over-night? I agree this is very weird. To me it sounds like she is hiding her true intentions.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	She's adamant  about it?  Yeah, I would be worried.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Sounds fishy to me.|`|DpN6MCvSaa	I guess that would, in my opinion, depend on how old your wife is. If she is worried about driving drunk, then she should be open to you picking her up. If she has never slept over a friend's house and is insisting that she needs to, I would also be a little worried. It may just be that she really just wants to spend one whole night away from the baby just to relax. <br>  <br>  I doubt that this is the case, but if you think about it... If she was cheating on you, or doing something behind your back... nothing you can say or do now would prevent her from doing it. If she is that type of person, she will find a way to do what she has to do; she will always be that type of person. I would just give her the benefit of the doubt and trust that being married and having a newborn, she just needs a night out.|`|Ef4rGLGvaa	Unless you have any reason to think she'll be cheating on you, then, no, I wouldn't worry about. Having a new baby can really make a woman feel like crap. They start to feel like their life is over. So your wife probably just needs to go out with her friends, get drunk, and not have to come back and feed a crying baby at 4am. If she starts doing this all the time, she may be depressed or there could be something else going on. But it SOUNDS like she just needs a break. Don't worry until she gives you a reason to worry.|`|HzVR8Wahaa	Sounds pretty Fishy to me!  I'd tell her you aren't comfortable with it.  I am a stay at home mom too, with a 2 month old, and I understand her need to go out for a drink with the girls but that's a bit excessive to want to stay the night.  And the fact that she doesn't want you to pick her up sounds very suspicious to me!  I wouldn't allow it to happen if I were you.|`|AA12244948	I can see why you'd be worried. But also understand being a stay at home mom can be very stressful. My neighbor has a young baby, stays at home and unfortunately screams at the poor little thing every time it cries :( <br>  <br>  She probably just needs a nice night out away from the crying, diaper changes, etc. If she starts insisting on more than a girl's night out a week to the whole weekend being gone, then perhaps you need to see what's up. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't jump on her case, show that your interested in her plans but not trying to spy on her.|`|VEE7YSzZaa	When my baby as 6 months i was sooo overwhelmed, so i stayed with my brother and his wife for one night, we had fun, since they have no kids. My brother wasss so sweet, his wife went to sleep and we spent the night talking and watching old re-runs of movies and shows we loved when were kids, i did not sleep at all, but i fel soooo refreshed the next morning. So maybey she just needs a night of... If you trust her, what is the problem??|`|0tusTThyaa	I wouldn't worry about it. Chalk it up to girls night out. While I completely understand you are willing to go and pick her up. Sometimes new moms just need to get away. And that's ok too! <br>  <br>  Offer to drop her off at her friends house and then pick her up when she calls in the morning. Again, I wouldn't worry about it. As long as there have not been any terms or feelings of an affair.<br>  <br>  Relax Dad and enjoy your time being the MOM with the baby.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	It depends how far they are going out of town. <br>  My fiancee let me go out with a couple of good friends of mine to Reno. Your wife probably plans on being out all with her girlfriends and not come home. She needs to go out and get refreshed and charge her batteries up again. You wait and see she will be a different person when she comes home. ( In a good way). <br>  If your wife has never given you any insecurities about her you should let her. How often does she do this sort of things? If it's all the time then be concerned.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	I agree with you that a night out going to a bar and then staying overnight is not appropriate for a married woman. Somehow, if she craves for the single life, you must make it clear to her that you find it appropriate to spend the night with her friends.<br>  <br>  For more info on marriage and what it entails check out my source.|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	yes you should, i think you should print this out and show it to her.....hello she is not a single teenager anymore, who spends the night??? you go out have some fun and go home,,,,,,,she is a wife and a mother and shouldnt be acting like some 18 year old..usually spending the night would be the last resort to not drive drunk but you are there and offering to pick her up,,you need to check her quick,,,,,|`|MYU46ap5aa	Let it go.  Women do this from time to time.  Don't let your mind get away from you.<br>  <br>  What goes on in the dark will come to light, meaning if she does cheat it will come out.|`|hEYMqfRBaa	i agree that its weird.... it seems like shes well past the " sleepover" age! i would just ask whos house she is going to, and if she stutters or pauses or wont tell you, then its time to get really suspicious|`|Z1UYtOQKaa	Once you get married things change no married women stays away from home all night that's some thing that you should agree on. no a offense but after 1o'clock there is nothing open but legs|`|Q9HsDMAgaa	no she should not be spending the night out somewhere!! <br>  she is married and has a very young baby!!!|`|Qkjt2GVEaa	get the baby DNA tested while she's away -|`|CBEnnsnxaa	Trust her..|`|EVdYnEIpaa	sometimes u just have to go with the flow!!!! look give her some time to her self everyone NEEDS  break!!!!!|`|HMhUKAgkaa	sounds fishy...|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Yeah, I'D be suspicious.
GLKD89wnaa	It is creepy for 11yr daughter to want sleep in bed with her dad. Thank God she lives far a way and make sure she stays there. She is showing signs that she is being sexually abused may be by her mom.|`|PI7v39ihaa	the fact that she is making up lies is the only worring thing. try to be understand she is still young and probably thinks there is still a chance her mam and dad will get back together. This would explain why she will try to put distance between you and ur husband. it must also be hard for her to only see her dad when he can visit knowing your child can be with him all the time.|`|rNynKMHMaa	Whatta' freak!<br>  Shes just jelous of the relationship you and your partner share she probably wishes her parents were still together. And the fact you two have a baby together wont help either, she probably feels really left out and neglected.|`|cLPimVR6aa	Yes it sure is. The mother seams to be Driving the kid crazy. There is no way 12yr child of mine is going to share bed with me is just nasty. What **** the mother is thinking. You guys should call child Services to see if the mom is doing something else to this kid.|`|YWoVltTWaa	It sounds like she's some little girl who misses her dad with her real mom and she's having a hard time dealing with it. When my parents got divorced I was about 5 or 6 and surprisingly I didn't mind, but not many ppl are like that.|`|IrquK9N6aa	I would stick with what you said. Let her sleep in the room, but not the same bed. I do think that is very creepy.|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Sounds like she was sexually abused.|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	does sound a little out of the ordinary|`|Q9HsDMAgaa	she is longing for attention.....or very evil and trying to cause problems for you|`|0tusTThyaa	The both of you need to set clear boundaries with her.While she is attention seeking, you need to NOT give it her. Her dad needs to tell her that if she is going lie [sex in the hotel] than she will not be allowed to stay in the hotel with you all. You will just have to pick her up and drop her off at mom's house. <br>  <br>  As far as the sleeping in bed thing. I would'nt have a problem with it IF she was a he. I slept with my mom when I was a teenager. There is just nothing like cuddling with your mom. However, she is a developing teenager and your husband is a grown man. And I'm sure he suffers from the occasionaly morning wood. Not something that daughter needs to bump into in the marital bed.|`|OYD5QqBfaa	No i dont think it is creepy, obviously she is envious of the relationship you and her dad have. This to me is somewhat normal, how would you feel if you were her age and your dad wasnt in your life everyday acting like a father. She probably feels like he chose you over her. Your husband isnt acting like a father, he should be with her, its good that he visits her. Maybe she wants alone time w/ her dad without you being there, she wants to get into bed w/ you guys not because she is creepy but she wants his attention, she wants what she didnt get when she was a young child. (kids usually hop into bed w/ parents when they are young for comfort) she didnt get that as a young child so she is acting it out now. Maybe you should give them space and let them have there 1 on 1 time. she shouldnt have to compete for his attention and it sounds like when you are around she has to.|`|B359bLqsaa	I have a step daughter like this.  She is always trying to cause problems and she knows exactly what she is doing too.  But there is nothing you can do to help her on your own.  Your husband has to help you and he needs to be the one to stand by your decisions.  If she is anything like my step daughter, she probably tries every way she can think of to put you at odds with each other.  I'm at the point where I dont want her coming to my house any more and he wants to see her he can go over there.  The last time she came over, she threw a big fit because I asked her to do something, she hit me in my stomach and ran into the bedroom and started hitting her head on the way.  All this was just manipulation to try to get me and him fighting too....|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I don't think it's creepy.  I think it's just a run-of-the-mill behavior issue which is stopped easily enough with a simple no.  Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.|`|bf6K6uubaa	zoloft is for depression so what behavior probls were they at school...seems like something is missing.  and yes its not normal for her to sleep in between you all but its maybe her way of bonding and feeling loved by both of you...it could also be that her mom tells her to do it..either way try to love her and be there for her and be happy that she lives far away|`|AA10500537	no kid takes zoloft <br>  you;re exaggerating.<br>  sorry i can;t agree with you.<br>  when she comes to visit her mom could sleep in the room with her,|`|IXskJPlVaa	Be strong and keep her away. She need medical attention and don't delay that - take her to a good counsellor. Best of luck.|`|cb76b5cf2e273e704d7f31195504dc33aa	It's not creepy, she's just being a clingy child. She is upset because she doesn't see her father as much as she wants, which probably accounts for the behavioral problems at school as well. At 11 years old she's still a CHILD. She needs her father to be more present in her life, even if it's just a nightly phone call, and she needs to be reassured that her father will always be there for her. Maybe she could get some counseling. I cannot believe someone would put a child on Zoloft just because of behavior problems at school, especially a child who's obviously having divorce issues.
ZxoU6Qvgaa	Wait, was what you wrote about her?

Are we talking about a story or something of that sort that you wrote or a letter?<br>  <br>  I'm going to guess some sort of short story, and answer that way.  Most people (but especially females) don't like to be kept waiting.  However, you do have creative license in the sense that you can end your writing in any way you see fit, and if she is angry, well, that is her issue to deal with.  <br>  <br>  Or, you could be a sweetheart and write her an alternate ending where the girl gets the boy (example, whatever) and watch her smile as she reads the "unrated director's cut".|`|RRGoldrAaa	Sam A <br>  Yes you are EVIL ..<br>  <br>  And i don't she will be mad nor disappointed .<br>  Unless she is a complete FREAK .<br>  Like that woman from Misery movie ..|`|AA10847292	if she is a good friend then she won't even care it's just a story or what ever no big deal! :) hope it all works out well!|`|MTkUXfXgaa	maybe a little diappointed not pissed|`|SoUDkOejaa	nah

54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	Everyone has a different situation and comfort level. Some people can be friends and have nothing ever happen. However, you always run a risk when someone of the opposite sex is involved. My wife has a couple of male friends she has known for several years and they are nice guys. She occasionally speaks to them by phone. However she does not disrespect me by spending time alone with any male.<br>  <br>  I know of another instance where a man's wife was friends with a guy for seven years and nothing ever happened until they ended up alone one day. She claimed no attraction to him and didn't even know why she did it but that did not save their marriage.<br>  <br>  It's a touchy subject because myself and friends I know have all been cheated on at some point due to a so-called "friend". If your partner is okay with it, then great. If not, then the real question would be what's more important, a friend of the opposite sex or the person you fell in love with?|`|B359bLqsaa	its perfectly fine to have friends of opposite genders.

It is not worth risking my relationship with my soul mate and the love of my life just to have a female friend. I don't need friends that bad. There are guy friends I can play a round of golf with or whatever.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Every girl I have loved in my dating history has cheated on me with an opposite sex friend or broken up with me to hook up with an opposite sex friend. It hurt me a lot and influenced the way I now feel about women and relationships. However, that is my problem. It's not my wife's problem. I did what I needed to do to get past this problem, so I could be the man who my wife deserves to be with. I am never jealous of opposite sex friends. I seriously do not care. If she wants to see someone else behind my back, I will eventually find out what kind of person she is. If she would rather be with someone else, she is free to do so. I am not going to demand she be with me just because. Her life, her choice. I just won't be a part of it if that's what she wants. So I give her ultimate trust. Part of the reason it is easy for me is because she tries very hard to be respectful. She doesn't keep close friendships with many guys, and the guys she is friends with are mostly all guys that I know anyway or husbands of her girlfriends. She is very respectful in that regard of our relationship, so like I said she has ultimate trust. She can go meet a guy for coffee or whatever; it doesn't bother me one bit. My life is so much better not worrying about that stuff. And if cheating does happen I will survive just like I did all those other times.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I have a lot of guy friends and my common-law has a couple female friends. He knows most of my guy friends (because he knew them before we met, and got together because of two of them) and I've never met most of his female friends. When we hang out with other people, it's generally in a group we've known since high school (although we didn't know each other then). <br>  <br>  I think it works out okay because neither of us is jealous. I've been cheated on before, and what I found out is people who want to cheat will find a way, and nothing you do or however paranoid you are will change that. Additionally, I have on occasion had a male friend make a pass at me when we've been hanging out alone; when that has happened, I have quickly ended the friendship and told my man about it first, so it doesn't get back to him in some distorted way.<br>  <br>  The only rules we have are to trust each other, and be honest with each other. That's the most important thing to me anyway, so it works.|`|ruczpWrGaa	His best friend is a woman.  She is incredibly nice. he will go and have coffee and talk with her.  When we first met, i actually thought she was his girlfriend.  Instead she ended up setting us up.  I know the extent of their friendship and it doesn't bother me one bit.    It works for us.  Some of my best friends are guys.  He meets them.  He gets along with them.  We both count on the other to do whats best for us.|`|9qf2HSGYaa	I have found it just depends on the relationship you and your spouse have.

For example, we may go to dinner with another couple but he never goes to lunch with a female co-worker or friend, that's unacceptable to both of us.|`|RcpRW202aa	yes my husband has friend girls. <br>  <br>  I understand that with them their is no sexual attraction and that they came along before i did.<br>  <br>  1 he never goes out with them with out tellings me or me going along<br>  2 he always tells me what they talk about<br>  <br>  we have open communication with each other. he is still friends with 1 of his exs from over 10 yrs ago and i have no problem with it either.|`|by9KuBizaa	Sure... I'm a female and my best friend is a guy.  Hubs knows.  My friend and I talk frequently, have lunch.  No big deal|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	i honestly don't think its a good idea...we are human beings and the temptation will always be there
adcCJrNxaa	Go do something else to occupy your time. Like go to the book store. I don't see y she can't even call you for a quick minute anyway. She won't be studying all the time. Like walking to class, before she goes to sleep but thats just me! Go to a movie, do whatever you have to do to be sure you dont pick up the phone and call her.|`|hD5xU3Moaa	become your own best friend
4TtPUHwzaa	lol Sue|`|ibeVcQyWaa	The size of the letters is meaningless.  Sometimes, people put in all caps just to get a point across, like WHAT were you thinking.  Why is it annoying?  They're letters, big or little, what's the difference?|`|pBnO8rDcaa	Tell them what you just said..that using cap locks makes it seem like their yelling at you..On justin tv you get kicked out of the chat room for doing that...|`|dzHbx8Zxaa	tell them to **** OFF|`|W8R0FrROaa	just be honest, tell them|`|P0EAzyw8aa	get over it|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	you just did|`|mc6YtaRbaa	<a href="http://www.netmanners.com/email-etiquette/caps-formatting-dont-matter/" rel="nofollow">http://www.netmanners.com/email-etiquett...</a>|`|9PfEKygaaa	JUST TELL THEM, JEESH<br>  <br>  <br>  like you didn't see that one coming!|`|7KRYTaReaa	just be straight up with them, its get to me too. you're just telling your mind, im sure they wont mind|`|ecNeN0staa	Tell them like this:<br>  <br>  STOP WRITING IN CAPS, YOU STUPID ?SSHOLE!!!
wG9vlIoJaa	Like you said, he's flirting with you.<br>  So that's exactly what he's doing. Flirting.<br>  I'm not sure if he really intends to ask you out.<br>  Perhaps you should do exactly that. Flirt back, and that's it.<br>  <br>  And like the others have said, it's not a good idea to date someone at work.<br>  <br>  If you ask why guys do this? Well, not all guys do. Only the ones not ready for a real relationship. Why they do this? For fun.|`|AA10952386	Men think with the head in their pants, not the one on their shoulders. That's the truth. It's much easier to flirt and keep a girls' expectations than to ACTUALLY get together and make an effort to spend time with her. Imagine him sending those messages to a dozen other women...Don't be surprised if he is. <br>  He wants to keep up this game because it's fun to him and he gets excited knowing you enjoy it. Any more than that, he has to use his heart and TAKE YOU somehwere...Too much work for him.<br>  Ignore him until he gets the message. You're too good for this loser.|`|eus7WqzUaa	He is scared of rejection.|`|cM9DBbgnaa	he just wants to hit and quit and forget he ever did it!!! XD|`|oHN6jwjoaa	maybe this is showing that he just wants some.<br>  if you know what i mean.<br>  <br>  i know guys like this.<br>  they find out that they might be getting a little more<br>  then a friendly talk.<br>  so they start talking to you more and wanting to hang out more.<br>  <br>  if he doesnt ever want to hang.<br>  either ask him.<br>  and if he claims he cant on the day that you can.<br>  say forget it.<br>  hes not worth your time.|`|3tSLepEFaa	Never dip your pen into the company ink. He isn't worth it.<br>  If the relationship doesn't hold, you still have to work with him. If this is an "all of a sudden thing" well.....I bet its a bet that you will say yes. move forward, stay friends.|`|8m6fJ6cXaa	Hay JJ gald to hear from you.  When are we going out?  Oh, I uhh, yes I think that you should see him on a dinner date.  Say Saturday 7:00pm?|`|RoyvUWl7aa	time will tell if he is just having fun flirting or if he will set a date.|`|UhZk09GDaa	Because he likes the chase but not the commitment.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	flirting is fun to do<br>  <br>  <br>  its like a game, a social game|`|EJJtCUKHaa	it is a LOT harder than you think<br>  <br>  too much fear involved :(|`|Di6FAQxRaa	he wants sex only.|`|8XT17ra1aa	He said he was working on a setting a date.  Sounds like an offer to me.  You should suggest a date, cut him a little slack.  The flirting is encouraged in my book.  Do you not like him flirting with you?  If you don't want to get with him, then just let him know that in some way. Do you respond to him flirting with you?  If you never responded to him, then he may be stuck on that until you give him some kind of signal that he can stop hitting on you.  Be carefull, though, you may miss it when he stops. lol|`|wtBx5v13aa	He is not sure if you like him or not and wants to get to know you better, to get a feel if you two could really hit it off.|`|B2X6jhqFaa	Because all he wants is to park the porpoise in you.  He's not going to waste any more time.|`|CaqdDzQZaa	almost all guys are after one thing....<br>  but not to have a girlfriend or a date just to get lucky if he hitting on you he seeing how far he will get that night|`|pAq4poaWaa	Well i think that you should just give it more time and that he'll ste one one when he's truly ready.|`|ht2AlMAHaa	i think that he scared to ask you out on a date or maybe he is waitn on you idk|`|1LxK1Grcaa	he is working on setting a date, lol|`|SCiY5JESaa	MAYBE HE WANTS TO BUT HE'S AFRAID OF REJECTION.<br>  WHY DONT YOU ASK HIM OUT, IT SOUNDS LIKE THATS IS WHAT YOU WANT1
l44FgbYKaa	ok what????????|`|AU3HVTToaa	she does|`|BO28Mn8haa	Wow I felt so invasive reading all of that. You seem like such as dork lol, you need to take it easy with her and breathe. I can just feel your nervousness as I read through that. Just be yourself and relax. She seems to like you for exactly who you are though, and she seems to like that personality about you. Take it easy, and see where it goes! Good luck. Let me know if you need some more advice. I'm a 20 year old college student so I can help you with the girl mentality lol =)<br>  <br>  fxyroxy777@hotmail.com|`|tGcNmDUZaa	I think you guys have a connection. Ask her out sometime.|`|Bv5dJQMFaa	i think she likes u as a friend and some one to talk to but u can try asking her out and see wat happens|`|inHC1eRRaa	wats the question?? lol yea i think she likes u|`|RVlkauBRaa	I think she does! Go geta tiga ROAR ;p<br>  But she deffinetly does|`|UhZk09GDaa	I'm sorry I gave up reading right after the first paragraph. Summarize please. xD|`|a55c24f1dd0dab9bef4e763156dfd053aa	OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FRIKIN LONG QUESTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sounds like she thought you were cute, but didnt LIKE you...........|`|MWsyCdcVaa	too long, didnt care enough to read, srry lol.|`|aQkbl3UNaa	yep|`|0Y5W7nTSaa	WHta I see, is that she is very interested in you. You should ask her out because I'm 90% sure that she likes you. First thing is that she made eye contact. Girls don't just do that. That is the biggest hint. When you ask her and she says no but she blushes then she odes like you she is just afraid of saying yes.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	i think she likes you, she even went out her way to say bye to u and she accepted  u on facebook. So take the next step and ask her out to a movie or something....she definately likes u. good luck !|`|iYdyFW3Uaa	Ask her out already. At least just to hang out again. More time in person will definitely give you a clue as to whether she likes you but it sounds like she already does.|`|xTkEucgvaa	haha ima guy but i had to answer this...but she deffinately likes you...fo sho dude. you should like ask her out..sounds to me like yo shuld ask her out..she seems into you cuz u both at college (or thats wat i got from ur little chat on facebook) and u seem like u like eachother...good luck**|`|Dp6yNwKkaa	It's obvious she is not interested.|`|75W0xZutaa	she definetly likes you|`|D08pc5zvaa	hey dude she is totaly into you if you need help getting girls and your reading this your already halfway there mail me at bladewee@yahoo.com|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	She likes you! Jeez dude ask her out|`|1cbEQ1sQaa	i think its too early to decide whether she likes you or not<br>  but what i can say is that she is interested hands down on that.<br>  yesss i read evrything i like to when ppl need help :)<br>  well as i was sayingg shee is interested in you if not she wouldnt have accepted that invite<br>  i never do only if it was a guy i was interested in. <br>  she wouldnt have mind to even keep on talking to you<br>  hope this helped :)|`|55TRTY9Taa	yes i think she does bc when you walked away she said nice meeting you so she wanted to tell you something be fore you left and she was laughing girls laugh when they flirt!plz awnser my question bc i need help to no if this guy likes me plz thanx!|`|A90Tc2KEaa	haha dang that was a lot, but it was fun to read =)<br>  hmm maybe she might have a lil crush on you...if she stares a lot, unless she has a staring problem haha but she could be trying to fight those feelings because she has a boyfriend and wants to be faithful to him. i say you should not go after her because you dont wanna lose a friend. maybe you should go after one of her friends ;D, or maybe when they break up you can go after her, but not right away|`|K1otsFPNaa	she might like you. it seems like both of you are really outgoing. its hard to tell. its either she likes you or she just likes to talk. the best thing i could tell you to do is ask her to have dinner or something with you as friends. Then you can see how well it goes and then maybe ask her out. good luck (:|`|UHR5yi9iaa	After reading all of it! It sounds that she likes you! But the only way your gonna find out for defiantly is to aks her, sounds likes your a confident person ;)<br>  Even if she doesn't like you that way she obviously wants to spend more time with you - who knows what might happen!|`|bPiAtjV0aa	I think so cuz if she doesn't like you she wouldn't be like 'hey I like talking to you' 'oh it's ok ya ya ya sure' 'this is so cool' 'Omg' or what so ever that she says. I'm not trying to be mean or any thing but this is what typical girls including me say. You do know this is kind of like weird, I mean your conversations you know. Yeah she does like you and you sure should ask her out, she looks like an exact match for you or something.<br>  <br>  <~Ashley~>(Peace):]|`|cLad8HuLaa	I THINK DAT SHE DUS LIKE U CUZ OF HOW SHE SAID DAT SHES GLAD DAT YALL MET N HOW SHE LIKES TALKIN 2 U DAT SEEMS DAT SHE IS INTERESTED IN YOU.|`|jBpPesehaa	Man shes definently digging you!!!!! You need to just ask her out!!! Take her to do something fun..But yes shes definently waiting for you to ask.|`|ls7tcUpiaa	It sounds like she likes you, but she isn't head over heels. You need to go somewhere with alot of friends, but not a date, and get to know her, because mb she was just flirting. The facebook conversation wasn't very interesting, but i think it sounds like she had other things on her mind..mabey the night before..?|`|oKLmS2CVaa	ya i think so and i think you should go for it but that's just me well i think that is sweet that you added her on facebook but anyway you should get to know her first then think about going out|`|u4FIwBNWaa	Your overanalyzing....Just ask her out! LOL.  Ask her for her number to call her up and ask her for date! Good luck man!|`|QNhNQyIraa	Judging by both of your actions, it seems that there might be a spark between you two. You can not say that she has a crush on you just yet, but she may be interested. To really find out if she is interested, I would suggest doing some minor flirting. If she takes the hook and flirts back, then chances are good that she may like you more than you think. If not, I would give her time and space and if you really want to be with her then you should try over a certain time period.|`|orTqq9KFaa	I think she digs you, that's just my opinion but i think you should ask her out and see where it takes you
JOVWBOOCaa	It definitely sounds like he is not over you as well. I would play it by ear, don't rush things. Show him how much you care about him and prove to him that you want to be with him. Give him time to see that you have realized he is the one you want and the time to trust you. You are obviously on the right track so far! Good luck!|`|PrkW6YV4aa	If you haven't done the do, you're still friends.
bu6BhCnpaa	my general rule of thumb that i learned from experience was: if alcohol is involved it doesn't count for anything.<br>  <br>  so as far as i am concerned, none of those conversations ever happened, and you never hooked up.<br>  <br>  if he is into you, he can come talk to you when you are sober...but he hasnt done that yet, has he?<br>  <br>  yea bad sign.<br>  <br>  and what he was saying the whole time...take it to heart until he says somethign when hes SOBER to make you think otherwise.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  when they drink...i dont care if its a little drunk or a lot drunk...they will do stupid stuff...and so will girls...<br>  <br>  just move on...seems like a jerk...also from experience: if a guy likes you he will make sure your first kiss isnt a drunk one|`|iYdyFW3Uaa	If you are really as emotionally detached as you claim then maybe he is afraid of the same thing you are. Maybe he is afraid of being rejected so he is hiding behind the "**** i was really just drunk" defense in case you don't actually like him. I say that he is into you.|`|9c1N7skCaa	yes|`|52bb38389ace91aedab5837d20eb5996aa	i'm sorry. but if he was into you you wouldnt doubt it or he would make an effort to let you know. maybe he likes you but just as a hook up. if you want to take the chance let him know how you feel. but it sounds like "he's just not that into you."|`|AU3HVTToaa	yes
9PfEKygaaa	practice kissing|`|YYdtd47baa	Have you ever had friends over before? Well, obviously you have, but what do you usually do? This isn't a new friend, like you said, so there shouldn't be a problem. Why don't you ask one of your parents to take you two to the movies, or you could hang out inside and play on the computer. Yahoo Answers, games, facebook, there are a million things to do. You could always bake more cookies - or be daring a bake a cake with frosting! Have fun.<br>  Izy|`|4TN6LSVQaa	depends if you are a boy or girl<br>  boy- put make up on each other<br>  girl- wait till it stops raining and go mud boggin<br>  <br>  but then again i'm a girl and i do both.   so it really depends on you.|`|B4kf9jDGaa	read together or write stories together just sit and talk.....go sing in the rain!|`|fA42bQHraa	Watch a movie|`|ZRVxc4haaa	dress up as 80s workout video chicks and go serenade people with barbershop tunes outside of taco time! its what I am doing this afternoon! =]|`|R1HiVgBSaa	lol. go on yahoo answers! haha. play some sort of game or watch t.v. maybe. or practice kissing as the guy ahead said. lol. just advice. haha|`|hLvUiU7Maa	PLAY VIDEO GAMES|`|B0ypUuHXaa	Yeah looool practice kissing.
nUq4A3Xcaa	Good idea for you to stay away, it's only a day and I'm sure mom will bring you some tea.|`|DVHaIfIHaa	At this point I don't think you can convince your parents that you and your boyfriend didn't plan this entire situation. I'm afraid circumstantial evidence has found you guilty. Sorry.
zzUgYFy4aa	but whats up with the weird behavior? mmm, ask him<br>  <br>  you think im just looking too into it? anything is possible<br>  <br>  do you think thats a bad idea? no, just ask him <br>  <br>  do you think this is going better than last time? sounds like an opener to me

uTdEdpAeaa	just forgive him... take it one day at a time is all i can tell you to do and start doing things together such as having a night devoted to just the two of you like once a week. personally me i'd rather have my bf or husband look at porn then rather going out there and doing the deed with someone else other than me. trust me guys are horn dogs and they think about sex all the time so don't take it personally that he's looking at porn because you don't satisfy him in the bedroom. just forgive him and move on from there, there are bigger problems to face.<br>  <br>  how do you think married couples handle problems like this. talk it out with your bf because communication is the most positive source in your relationship and talk it out with him if you see that your relationship is worth saving.|`|9DjMGv5Uaa	You have two choices. A) Work through it together or B)Work through it without HIM/HER. It depends on how much you love EACH OTHER. If he/she doesn't show any remorse, than chances are, he/she doesn't reciprocate. Love isn't all chocolate. It's roses too. Beautiful, but comes with thorns.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	I don't know that I could recover.

If your partner has admitted wrong and has changed the habit or adjusted the lifestyle to move back to the center, you could be just fine. We all make mistakes but the key is have you learned from it and have you made a decision to move on in a positive direction. It hurts no doubt to be betrayed. And it will take time to build trust back up. it starts with the little things. Delivering the mail or sending out bills on time...the garbage, domestic chores, etc.....I would work on the partnership aspect of your marriage and try to build that up. Overtime you will build the positive and not reflect so much on the negative. You must have an open and neutral mind moving forward or it will be with you always. All things will pass in time....|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	This is really hard to say or answer as everyone doesnt have the same beliefs nor would i want to push them on others... but i have gone through the same things...and I pray that God helps me through these things he gives me peace in times of trial.

But it is hard to do so. It is almost impossible. But if you want to be with that person you will. But the past needs to be the past before you can move on with someone. That is the success story for everyone else; or almost everyone else. I have been hurt plenty and that is the only way it has been successful. If you rush back because you miss that person, you might find that that particular moment will come back to haunt you. Then you argue about it.etc. So take some time to figure out what will make you feel better about it. If in the end the answer is nothing. Then you know what to do. Leave their ***.|`|4PW44SHIaa	There is no happily ever after. If the man cheats, its like a diease in his system. he'll continue doing it and won't stop. Trust me i've been there. You don't just take it and die inside. You stand up and leave for there are better men in the world who will love you forever and you'll be the only one they'll need.

krQiDGCHaa	Let me start out by telling you that I am 23, I'm married, and I am a step mother myself.  My step son lives with my full time, and only sees his mother for 3-5 hours a week, so I really am a parent to him full time.<br>  <br>  First off, you are a tad overbearing, however no more so than any parent who has raised a child for most of his/her life.  I think step parents are parents too, and you definitely seem to have done a good job raising your "daughter", and seem to care greatly for her, which is wonderful.  I'm glad you can acknowledge that you're overbearing.  My MIL is very overbearing with my husband, and it has taken him getting married to me, and finally taking a stand against her for her to realize that he is a grown man and she needs to back off.  She never could really see how it is overbearing to be saying/doing the things she did -- I applaud you for this realization, it's very big of you.<br>  <br>  I'm also glad you apologized to her, that was big of you as well.<br>  <br>  Now, in regards to the mother -- your step daughter is 20 years old and a grown woman.  What is said between you and your step daughter is NONE of her mother's business, unless of course she chooses to make it her mother's business.  Apparently, in this situation, she DID choose to make it her mother's business -- that's fine.  However, it was NOT the mother's place to call you and chew you out.  This girl is 20 years old, not a child anymore, and it was definitely NOT okay of the mother to chew you out.  That being said, why did you listen to it?  Personally, if that were me, I would have said, calmly "Though I appreciate your concern, what transpires between my step daughter and myself is just between the two of us.  She is a grown woman, and therefore this is really none of your business.  Please do not call here again unless there is an emergency.  Thank you" And I would have hung up.  There is really no reason for the 2 of you to be talking AT ALL unless there is an emergency with your step daughter -- she's grown, it's not like you need to talk about what happened in school or when you're going to pick her up anymore, etc.  (FYI, I get along VERY well with my step son's mother.)<br>  <br>  As far as how to regard your step daughter, I'd keep it simple.  Say to her "Listen.  I'd like to apologize again for being overbearing to you.  I'll definitely work on it, and please let me know if I offend you again."  The end.  I WOULD NOT mention the conversation you had with her mother to her, at all.  What does it accomplish?<br>  <br>  Like you said, your daughter has a right to call her mother and tell her how she's feeling, or what happened.  So, if that is her right, then why ask her to stop?  What you SHOULD be doing, is focusing on her mother and how SHE reacted to the situation.  Don't take her phone calls if that is how she's going to speak to you; period.  All THREE of you are grown women, and this is absolutely ridiculous to me that she would think her actions here are okay in ANY way.  Don't bring your daughter into this, it will just cause drama and make her feel guilty.<br>  <br>  As to your husband's response -- great.  I'm glad he stuck up for you.  That being said, you really don't owe the mother an apology or explaination at all.  Your daughter is the only one who is owed ANYTHING.  Please remember that.  If this woman (the mother) is going to be rude to you, stop talking her calls.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You and your step-daughter have a wonderfully healthy relationship.  She felt comfortable enough to talk to you about her perceptions and you both acted reasonably and responsibly.  <br>  <br>  Her mother had no right to call you or swear at you.  Yes, she crossed the line.<br>  <br>  But please do not say anything to your step-daughter.  She will most likely be horrified to learn of her mother's behaviour and will feel caught between a rock and a hard place.  <br>  <br>  Just continue to work at your relationship with her.   It sounds as though the two of you respect each other on a personal level and love each other, too.  Let her mother be a *****. You don't need to invest yoru time or energy on her.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think your step-daughter is ungrateful for the love and concern you have shown her.  Mothers and daughter do talk however, so asking her not to talk about you to her mother isn't going solve anything.  I am 50, and my daughters are 22.  They still text me or call me everyday to see if I am ok after work, or if one of us drives out of town, we always check in before we leave, and when we arrive.  We can all sleep peacefully that way.  You are caring and nurturing, don't let her or your husband change you.  As for her mother, she is scum.  She should also be happy that you are caring for her daughter.  <br>  I am a step-mother, and my kids all|`|JX0I6x1paa	Stop letting the mum get to you.  So she called you and let off some steam with language that offended you.  By still stewing on it you are letting her get to you far more than she needs to.  Concentrate on being less overbearing with your step daughter and then her mother has no cause to ever bother you again.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	You don't get to have any control over any of the people involved here.  The stepdaughter is allowed to tell whoever she wants about the things that happen in her life.  Her mother's choice to call you shows she's got some issues and isn't the most mature and grounded person around.  Best to not engage her.  Your husband should have let it go.  What he said was nice, but probably fell on deaf ears.<br>  <br>  You would do well to stop commenting on every little thing your stepdaughter needs to do in her life.  She's an adult.  Time to take a deep breath and let her go.  You could say to her that you are going to try and request her forgiveness if you slip once in awhile, and that you  only do it out of caring for her.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	I know people (including yourself obviously) will say I'm wrong, but I don't think you're overbearing. You're looking out for the safety and well-being of your daughter. I mean heck, I am in my early twenties, married, my husband and I live in our own house and I still give my mom the respect to give her a call or text when we get home from leaving her house. Gees, she even asks if I take vitamins. <br>  This whole thing just bothers me because what happened to the days when moms were responsible for their children?! I don't understand the issue really. Maybe the meat thing was taking it too far, but in all honesty you probably thought she didn't like it that way. I appreciate everything my mom does for me because I am a grown woman and really she doesn't have to do anything more for me but she does. For that I am grateful and would never complain about it.|`|UUrqECXIaa	Yes, I think the mother went over board. There was no reason for her to talk to you like that or even to talk to you at all. The problem seems to be that the 20-year old daughter doesn't appreciate being treated like a child. Well, I'm sure she feels that way about her own mother too. The daughter should've talked to you about her concerns in the first place and her mother should've just kept her mouth shut.<br>  <br>  I think your husband handled the situation very well. You must really appreciate having his support.<br>  <br>  As far as addressing the issue with your step-daughter, you could say something like I prefer that conversations between you and I remain private or if you ever have a concern like this again please speak to me about it etc..But seriously, don't expect her to always abide by this. <br>  A good rule of thumb is to expect that what the two of you discuss might get back to her mother at some point in time so be careful what you say.<br>  <br>  I'm a step-mom too, BTDT

ibeVcQyWaa	"Girls" hate it, "women" on the other hand, not so much.  When you find a real woman, she won't put you in a certain category but will appreciate you for being able to show who you are and not act like some statue with no feelings.|`|Bgzq0K1Iaa	When my ex ever cryed, I only hated the thought of him upset.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	I hate it. It's a sign of weakness. Grow a pair, wil you?|`|hLWy1evQaa	Girls don't hate it unless it's excessive. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend cries when things are particularly emotional between the two of us. I find it sweet because it lets me know that he really cares about me and our relationship. <br>  <br>  That said, he doesn't cry about everything. As long as you're not bawling about, i don't know..flowers and kittens and all that, you should be fine. Tearing up in a movie is perfectly okay. It's sweet of you to watch movies like that with your girl and I'm sure she appreciates it.|`|a2wZg7DQaa	i think when boys show there sensative side is hot. when they cry alot its anoing and weird but when something upsets them they shouldnt be afraid to show there feelings my ex never cryed and it was silly. but my current boyfriend is amazing he never is afraid to say or show how he feels and hes so hot i love it :)|`|YWdNTZU3aa	well when you meet a girl like that get your gf to smack the piss out of them because if guys can't cry neither can they|`|AA10408380	Because guys are supposed to be tough. Even when they want to cry, they hold back, because it makes them vunerable. So when a girl sees a guy cry....well, I...would hate it, because I'd wonder what I did or said to bring on tears. I mean, it must've been something pretty bad if I made my MAN cry. But if u do it too much, then ur seen as a wimp and no girl will pay u any heed. Plus, it'll also seem as manipulative and that's such a girl move if u do that. That's such a turn off. But real men don't cry much, because they're stronger, more arrogant, less sensitve, so if he cries when he needs to, that just means he' not afraid to show emotion...that's awesome...but if he's got a leaky faucet, he's a crybaby, no body likes a crybaby.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	Well when my bf cries its something BIG to me. He never crys... in the 3 years we been together hes cried like uuumm twice. My ex in the other hand cried for every thing! Cried out his beautiful green eyes for any little thing...at first it was sweet but then it got so annoying and it got old. He was a big cry baby and cried for everything to make me feel bad. Like i said it got old and i dumped him. he was drama!|`|0Mk3iRIkaa	Because the image of what is MASCULINE is complete and utter nonsense.<br>  If you can't find a woman who appreciates you for your FULL RANGE OF HUMAN EMOTIONS, they don't deserve you.<br>  They want some retard who reads GQ and watches UFC. That's not a man, thats a construct|`|MmmcKU52aa	what makes you think that?? it fine for a guy to cry every now and again, it shows that he is human. plus its way better than being the tough, abusive guy.<br>  <br>  however, if you cry more than we do, it might make you look like a pansy, and we don't like that. (or at least i dont, lol)<br>  <br>  haha hope i helped :]|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	I can honestly tell you that girls love it when a guy shows his true emotions and isn't afraid to cry infront of a girl.

Girls love it, trust me xx|`|76103968117df175d167ef954312b2fdaa	it depends how you cry...<br>  <br>    a.) if its all whiny with a lot of noise and weird facial expressions then girls might get creeped out...<br>  <br>   b.) if you cry silently without much weirdness then its not so bad..<br>  <br>  and it also depends on what type of girl your with...|`|r3mFOMmgaa	Males crying = emo and feminine.|`|5NFsCNBUaa	aww i think its cute when guys cry :)!|`|sauE94zVaa	I don't hate it.

Stay away from her if you don't like her, whats so hard about that. For every action there is a reaction. But it really sounds like it you with a problem. Remember for every action there is a reaction. Go do something good for someone instead of thinking how you can hurt someone, it will only come back to you and you deserve everything you get!

The wife does not exercise authority over her own body, but her husband does; likewise, also, the husband does not exercise authority over his own body, but his wife does.<br>  The bible also states that a man should not hurt his wives feelings.<br>  So you see it would never be right to beat your wife.|`|gB1dXEHCaa	only on tuesdays and fridays between 3pm and 9 pm....but there has to be a valid reason.  a vaild reason would be 1)dinner not ready on time 2)refuses to give you oral  3)won't leave the back door unlocked  4) house is not clean.  <br>  <br>  also, the beating can be accumulated over time.  so if she goes the whole weekend without fulfilling the above you can theoretically get in several beating on tuesday beginning at 3 pm.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	NEVER!

AA11990465	You are both causing the mistrust in your marriage by flirting with other people. Unless you are both willing to stop behaving the way you are, I don't see either one of you ever being able to trust the other one.

MMnjWEM7aa	I have a thirteen year-old stepdaughter whom I definitely get along with. It is difficult, however, that she lives across the country (husband's in the military).  It's so hard to try to build a relationship with her when her mother fills her head with hateful things about me.  Of course she will listen to her mother...<br>  <br>  I know the ex does it out of jealousy because she can have no other possible reason.  I showed up in my husband's life four years after the divorce was final and she didn't like that even though she was the one who left him.<br>  <br>  Anyways, dealing with a stepdaughter who is constantly skeptical is pretty difficult.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	We both have kids from our previous marriages.<br>  <br>  He loves my kids, they love him.  (boy 14, girl 19)<br>  <br>  His kids don't like me.  Not because of who I am, but because of what I represent.  They are emotionally stunted and unable to acknowledge after 5 years that their parents are not getting back together.  They are rude to me and my kids.  They treat us poorly.  As such, I don't love them and don't anticipate ever loving them.  I bend over backwards to be nice, to try to be involved and get **** on every second weekend.<br>  <br>  However.. I love my husband like life.  He is a wonderful partner, father and step-father.  I will continue to try to build a relationship with his children and will never hold it against him that they are messed up.  It's not their fault that they have been taught to hate.  They act this way because it makes their mom happy, and they know what life would be like if she wasn't happy...  Some day, when they are free to make their own decisions in life, I am confident they will look back and see that I would have loved them if they'd let me.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	This is 2nd marriage for both of us and yes we both have kids from the 1st marriage.

He had never been married or had any kids. He had never lived with anyone. He loves my child like he loves our other two. He shows no favoritism and Daniel loves him more than his own father. My husband is the one that has been his father, loved him and taught him right from wrong. I actually think that he would choose him over me if he had to choose. That is alright though.

She was out of control then & is 100 times worse now that she is an adult. She has never liked me becouse I am the step mom. She would get in trouble with the law or do bad things and her mother would her buy her something nice every time. No discipline what so ever. When her father & I would discipline her she would throw such a fit, he would give into her. She would bring things up that happened years ago and try to blame my son on those things. She is this way becouse of her mother & continues to walk in her shoes. Sad I know, but we had absolutely no control on her & my husband tried everything to correct her & she was & is very rebellious. She dropped out of school at 16 & continues to bad mouth her dad & I on the phone. She is very dis repectful towards her father & I. This is all becouse her mother has never liked me as his new wife. It was a very jeoulous & control issue with her. My step daughter made many threats a few years back & we had to stop allowing her here at our home becouse we have rules in out household that she wont abide by. The language she uses is filthy & we dont allow that either. I tried many years ago to have a relationship with her but I am hoping one day when reality hits she will understand. My husband is a good husband, father & step dad & tried to be the best he can for her. It just did not seem good enough. Maybe someday the mother will realize what damage she caused, who knows. I love my husband dearly & never hold it against him. Not all relationships with kids happen like this. Some exes can be friends and be fair for the other childs sake but this one was very manipulative. Good luck to you!|`|KmdvAnSsaa	I don't have step children or any children for that matter but I have an excellent step mother who loves me and my brother as much as her own two children which is a lot and means a lot.  Yes it takes a lot of trust but if you love someone trust is supposed to be there right along side of that love that you share together!<br>  <br>  My belief is that  they are out there. People who are just meant to be in you and your child's life, people who will care, love and respect your children as much as they love you!  that what really matters!|`|jBigEy0Caa	My husband has a daughter.  I am more like a friend to her now than a mom.  She does not live with us, so I do spend more day to day time with our kids that we have together.  She was only 2 when we met.|`|UUrqECXIaa	When I married my first husband, his son was around 7 years old. He did not live with us until he was a teenager. My step-son and I had a very good relationship when he was a child, a bit rockier when he was a teen. I have been divorced from my first husband for 7 years and my step-son is an adult. I have a good relationship with my step-son now, better than I do with his father. <br>  <br>  I have two sons from this marriage/divorce. They are both young adults now. I never thought that I would remarry until my kids were on their own but I did. I remarried less than one year ago. My present husband moved in with us. He has a good relationship with my sons and does more for them than their own father. But my boys do not think of him as dad and he does not expect them too.<br>  <br>  My husband has a 12 year old daughter. Her and I get along ok, but we are not very close yet.  She lives with her mother some distance away. My husband sees her weekly but does not always bring her to our home because of the travel time. I hope that someday we will get to know eachother better and become good friends. I don't ever expect her to think of me as mom.

76nTvO4iaa	Other than getting your ceremony and reception venues booked, it is too early to be doing much planning.<br>  <br>  When my son got married, I was in charge of getting "our sides" addresses together and the rehearsal dinner.  I was invited to her showers, etc.  DH & I hosted a brunch for "anyone who wanted to come" the morning after the wedding.|`|F4k68ilkaa	Nope. I enjoy sanity too much for that. ;)|`|8IA3d3NNaa	How about asking if there is any family traditions she would like you to incorporate (even if you don't it's nice to ask her).<br>  <br>  Edit: What's with the thumbs down? Just a idea, MY FMIL doesn't really want anything to do with the wedding planning (she has a three year old and is pregnant), her basic idea is "it's your wedding, you figure it out". It's never to early to plan, my wedding isn't until June 2010 and I (almost) got everything mapped out, in actuality it may save you some stress.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	You can do things like take her when you look for dresses and bridesmaid dresses. She can also come along with you for other things like cake and flowers. If she can sew dresses or make flower arrangements you can designate her those tasks.<br>  Really though, you dont have to. I'm not. Not only does she disapprove of everything i have so far (i'm not modest enough), she hasnt and isnt paying for anything so i dont owe her anything.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	My soon to be daughter-in-law had me go with them to try on bridesmaid dresses and has asked my opinion on things.

I know some mothers can be overbearing and pushy, but it sounds like you lucked out with his mom. Maybe when the itme comes, ask her to come dress shopping with you and your bridesmaids. Ask her to get the list together of invitees from your groom's side of the family since she will likely know more of them than your fiance will.|`|AA11380378	My mother in law :<br>  <br>  -Adressed all the invitations.

She's probably one of the sweetest people I have ever met and has always been so kind to me. She really does treat me like a daughter, and since she doesn't have any daughters of her own I can't imagine not inviting her to all the wedding stuff when the time comes.|`|6jZcr33paa	I'm not.  His parents told us they wouldn't even hold a rehearsal dinner. Like the previous poster said, if she didn't have such a crappy attitude toward helping out on some things I would. When we first told her over dinner that we were engaged she said "Well Megan I hope your parents are rich cuz don't expect us(his parents) to help with the wedding."|`|yvq7AtJuaa	I'm not.  I'm having a destination wedding so there is very little to plan for in that area.  My parents are footing the bill for a party when we get home.

As the Host and Hostess they send out printed invitations and the RSVPs are returned to them.<br>  <br>  As the Bride, you should give the Groom's Mother a list of names and address of all those people who will be in your wedding party plus anyone else that you would like to include (officiant, organist, soloist, any out-of-town guests coming in early) at the dinner/party.<br>  <br>  You can also ask the Groom's Mother to submit a list of names and addresses that she and her husband would like to invite to the wedding . .  help you address wedding invitations . . make the Ceremony Program . . create or purchase table favors . . help you address Thank You notes . . and if she has the room in her home, store bridal shower and wedding gifts temporarily.<br>  <br>  Answered by:  A Certified wedding specialist / A Professional bridal consultant / A Wedding Ceremony officiant|`|BObu4i9saa	first off - it's NEVER too early to start planning<br>  we got engaged on 4/19/08 - set the date on 5/1/08 for 5/2/10 & i've got almost everything planned already - i won't have to worry about too much when it gets close & i'm so happy about that (and i'm so not a planner)<br>  my future sister-in-law had a little over 6 months and was ripping her hair out trying to get everything done in time - she did end up forgetting some stuff (ex. i had to take an earring out of my ear & give it to her about 10 minutes before the ceremony so she'd have her something borrowed<br>  <br>  i personally can't really include my f-mil 'cause she's in TN & i'm in NY...but as for yours - just let her tag along for stuff like dress shopping (yours and the bridesmaids) and tastings with the caterers, stuff like that - she'll get to feel like she's part of it - but you don't have to find her a specific job|`|aipChC3haa	My future Mother In Law is an absolute angel from the lord above!

So she is a very crafty person so I am having her make the flower girl basket and ring bearer pillow.  She will also make sure that everything is in place on the tables on the wedding day.  She would be great at that.  Good luck!|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Well, we are paying for everything but the rehearsal dinner. She is taking care of that and I told her it was all up to her where it was. Other than that she really hasn't asked so I have just been showing her things and asking her opinion. She is helping me with my cupcakes too. It also depends on how the person is too. If you think she might barge her way in and make everything about what she wants then don't go to her first. Wait it out and see if she wants to help. Just always remember...it is YOUR wedding!|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	I took my future mom in law  to view the wedding venu and my dress... even tho she has horrible tase lol.

My mom is WAY more involved cause its my mom...but I didnt want to leave her out either.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Tell her you would let her know.  When the time comes, she could be in charge of calling the deadbeats who forgot to RSVPs.  Trust me.  This is the most important duty...and tiring, so be kind.

A lot of guys, especially teens, like girls with long legs. But there are guys who like the short cute girls too.<br>  You don't say your age so it's hard to know if 5'1 is good or bad. If you're 12 then it's fine. If you're 16 then it's a little short but no disaster!<br>  For 5'1 it's ok to weigh 115. That is within the healthy range.<br>  If your height is an issue for you I have tips on how to help your body grow if you're young enough.

Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire!!|`|AA11263103	you need to hit her.my brother did  that I learned fast.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Next time she hits you or does any harm to you. Just grab ahold of her, throw her to the ground, sit on top of her, hold her arms down to the floor..until she gives up. <br>  <br>  Do this every time she hurts you. She needs to understand, that it's not right to hit people just because she can. In reality of it, you should really give her a taste of her own medicine, but since you won't lay a hand on her (which I understand), then just pin her down and don't let up until she is calm down.|`|0iCOnBqOaa	Threaten her lol. I know its kinda mean but if she's totally spoiled say that if she hits you again you're gonna take her stuff and never give it back.<br>  <br>  If she still does it, take one of her dolls or something she loves and keep it in your room until she stops. <br>  <br>  If she tells your parents say that you will give her stuff back until she stops.<br>  <br>  If she starts crying and doesn't stop for a while go on your computer and chill lol let her waste her tears because she'll get tired of screaming her lungs off.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Sorry, but you got to give her a bit of pain back, next time she bruises you, give her a matching one back.<br>  <br>  Next time she threatens you, give her a chineese burn, just grab her arm in both your hands close together and twist in opposite directions. its well painfulland and only leaves a red mark for a short time. <br>  Explain that anything she does to you you will return times 10, preferaby while stil holding the arm for the burn<br>  <br>  You will probably be at war for a while but if she does'nt get to grips with reality she will try that for the rest of her life and end up abusive of her husbands and divorced with babies, and come crying to you for help, and abuse you for not giving enough no matter what you do.<br>  <br>  Nip it in the bud now, it may be a bit painfull but best in the long term.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NxBYuOzbaa	You are a very good brother. Anyways, if she is little, give her the silent treatment, scare her by crying really loudly when she hits you, tell her if she hits you you're going to run away because it hurts you that she's like that. If you're not gonna hit her (which is good) warn your parents that if THEY don't do something about it you're gonna dump water or something on her. Make her understand|`|BdJLiv7Laa	You sound like a good big brother. and ya you can't hit a girl. but your little sister is different. don't hurt her to bad just give her a reminder that your her big brother and that she needs to treat you with respect.|`|8Fdj3iZQaa	depends on how old she is, cause i would surely call the cops on her or put her tail in hospital in my opinion. fight back, tell her u aint taking her mess any more and ur done!

d5bb26110388802dbda15ee2194e0da4aa	It depends on how well I know the girl.<br>  <br>  If I knew her a little already then I would take her to a nice restaurant.<br>  <br>  If I just met her and barely knew her at all I would rather go for a walk or meet at a coffee shop.  That way the date is all about talking and getting to know each other.  I'm not going to try to impress a girl I don't know by taking her to an expensive restaurant.  That'll just make me look like a desperate loser.

They are two different things. True love is when you feel great about yourself and your partner makes you feel like the most beautiful, special person in the whole wide world.

My security comes from within me.|`|uXW5Kx0Caa	around my ex  we broke up early last year and we went through a patch of not talking me crying and even her dateing a mate of mine but after all  the name calling and tears she is still there as my mate wen i was dumped by my last gf she feeds me and even tho she says she dont give a crap about anyone else but herself she always asks whats up and gives advice  she is like my best mate an i would trust her with my life seriously im glad we are not lovers because it makes me happy that i have a friend i can rely on as much as her :)|`|ihxUZI3Haa	WOW.. Really nice question.. <br>  <br>  I feel safest when I'm with my boyfriend. I don't know what it is but he just makes me feel so secure. I sent him a text not so long ago saying "When I'm with you I feel safe.."<br>  <br>  I think its really weird to say my boyfriend as I would say that it primarily should be your family or your closest friends that make a person feel at their safest. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.. :)|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	To me, personally, having a relationship last more than a year means something.

AA11345773	I have a strange desire to care and look after for someone which is probably an odd desire for a bloke. I was just reading someones question about the fact that they cry whenever it's their time of the month and it popped in my head how I'd love to be there for someone when they were going through something like that, so I could look after them and give them a big hug etc and make them feel better. Guess I'm a bit of a girl really. Ooh Grey's Anatomy on.. excuse me.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	yes, i have so much love to give and no one to give it to|`|edCUawppaa	Yeah, thats why I pamper myself!|`|xGA5JSfLaa	awr this is so cute ^_^|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	No - usually I just want 5 minutes peace - on the go all the time like most Mums I guess|`|VpU4Aludaa	Work, work, work  ,it has to be hard without "Pamper"<br>  and to be selfish a little bit. <br>  !<br>  thanks|`|AA11705909	My Super Heroine Goddess, I am not worthy.<br>  If I may be so bold as to suggest you fly to Spiderman? <br>  I have noticed the look he gives you, he is in your power and can be "reasoned" with. If he is too epicene for you I am sure Batman would be very grateful for your mercies, I will deal with Robin.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Yes, that's why i have two very spoilt cats.|`|c34c2236afd420be57992daf512144dbaa	Don't start getting cats....that's just sad|`|zYAgbF49aa	Yes, of course...it must be human nature.
u0udwkZQaa	I'll put it this way, because no man is going to admit they could go for nearly any woman.<br>  <br>  Men cannot be friends --or they'll try, but they won't be happy about it-- with women they find attractive. It becomes a big problem if they are really close friends, rather than casual acquaintances.<br>  <br>  Single men also, are very horny and always thinking about being sexual, any attractive woman is a potential mate as long as she's not being hostile.<br>  <br>  Basically, the only thing that's going to make it easy for a single man to be just friends, is if the woman is not attractive. Even then, if they become really close friends, and they're both single, sex is going to come up eventually. It's all about boundaries. The only difference between a friend and a lover is the level of intimacy and closeness. As friends become closer, they become more socially intimate until they reach the point they are emotionally connected so deeply, they're not far away from making it physical. They're living almost like a couple but without the sex. They talk all the time, they know each other's secrets, they have domestics. That film "My best friend's wedding" with Julia Roberts wasn't far from the truth.|`|xouWDqpvaa	i find it really impossible. Because i usually only talk to girls i like.|`|f0YzgIoQaa	Most my friends are women... And yes, Im straight. I guess some guys just find it awkward though and I think girls find it easyer to just be friends with guys then vise versa.|`|3ph4WQKOaa	No most of my friends are women so not impossible to be friends with a woman.|`|AA10711210	Usually|`|TrmGBloHaa	no , its not imposible, I have many women just friends.|`|c8DjmWXxaa	no|`|6tzT8GFqaa	no i could be just freind, but that dosent mean that im not attracted to some of my freinds.|`|A7NOLXiCaa	I believe it is perfectly possible for any man to be friends with a woman, however, as mentioned before I slight physical indifference may help. However, I have had slight attractions and flirts with female friends that never hindered our understandings or grew into something serious.<br>  <br>  This said, most or at least many of my female friends are not straight and as such either there was no chance of scoring or when there was, it never grew into love.|`|6a8Ydw5Zaa	no i have many female friends but i wouldnt mind getting with them haha|`|nUOazoWWaa	and its not fair if its one sided and it usually is!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	nope not at all. most of my friends are women. if they were to start to flirt and wanted to be more than friends i suppose i would have to talk to them to find out what the heck is going on.|`|AA11705909	You can't fight the enemy if they have outposts in your own head.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Women make the best friends and I have a few even married ones. You just have to realize you can't always have it your way. Except for the guys that say they love you then beat the hell out of you.|`|pZevjTXGaa	it all depends on the situation, if I got led on by a female and she wants to be friends, it would be almost impossible.|`|TPud8FMFaa	If there's any sort of attraction, then it's basically impossible for me.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Well, if your attracted to them and your single its kind of hard.
ua2FEWRQaa	well if its for ur status my friends ALWAYS look at my staus and get te hint right away. it could be like "___you name here____ --- your driving me crazy! stop giving me the cold sholder and listen!!" they should get it <br>  <br>  -- <3 hope i helped|`|lNeBUxkGaa	You should try "Friends who are being JERKS!!!"<br>  or you should "friends who stab me in the back"<br>  Just something that is sarcastic
iIOJxjvUaa	depends if they are there, or you may be about to see them then quite a lot otherwise just whenever they pop into your head|`|2tn8EALqaa	Um, basically only in school or when I'm thinking about school. Usually when I'm about to go to that class period|`|Molu004zaa	He's the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning, I think about him at least once every hour during the day and he's the last thing I think about before I go to sleep. x|`|a87POYvAaa	umm, when i wake up, omw to school, when i go down for school, periods 1-6, when school is over, when i get home, when i do my homework, when i skateboard, when i drum(oh yeah =P bang action), in the bathroom, when i go to sleep, then over and over again till i dont like her anymore...|`|ZehXcyA2aa	all the time|`|qNJEiuvvaa	id have to sayyy almost every second!!!!<br>  <br>  theres a cupple ppl thoo!|`|5whqOJcxaa	i'm not exactly sure...about 40%-60% percent of the day :P
RhHv5pYwaa	Join them when there talking about something. Or ask someone a question and spark up a conversation. Then from there let it flow|`|vmMaWOFvaa	ask them out [not as a date ] like lets go get pizza or why dont we go bowling. those are always ways to become good friends.|`|3kaa5Vfkaa	um........................blowjobs
jA2VJXzFaa	i would tell them<br>  i dont really know about my pupils but if i did, id try to hide it|`|8SRjELNBaa	Buy her a puppy|`|7KjHEanCaa	There's the old say "I like you." technique., but girls never seem to believe it can be that simple.<br>  <br>  Technically, Your pupils grow if you see something pleasing, so the answer is yes. But if he looks at you and his pupils grow, check to see if there's a big cheeseburger behind you.|`|cQIErkCxaa	OMG is that true!? i have a guy friend whos eyes go black when he sees me!|`|4d62502510861ac4f6499590d0d9f5d5aa	I don't think that's true.<br>  We just talk more to you and treat you better than our other friends that are girls
AwHC8xdFaa	okay hun, listen up.<br>  to girls its a competiton. If she feels threatened by you <br>  she wants you to feel low about yourself, it could be hitting on your man<br>  just show her shes no threat. Flirt extra hard with him around her and <br>  act confidence like you know he likes you back.<br>  Dont' get mad at her for playing the game.. its what girls do<br>  <br>  just win the guy.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Oh lawl.  You better get him before she does!
xE6QTL1Waa	my oppinion is<br>  TALK TO HER!<br>  i love it when guys start conversation with me or even just say hi.<br>  im to shy to start conversation first so i want the to.<br>  say hi and see what happends, shes not gonna snap on you for being polite!|`|y5txRe27aa	Yes it is, same if with she pokes you or something, it's all flirting, she wants you to do something back.
skKZiJGDaa	OK the boy is shy and your shy right one of you has to step up to the other and since your the one who's asking for the advice you'll be the one who is going to do it...next time just ask him something...if your too scared to say hi or what up..just be like excuse me do u know the time or what day is today and it would look like your just asking a normal question if he wanted to talk to you he would not only answer your q but keep the conversation going if this happens you know he wanted to talk to you..its actually really simple just try what i said n you will c...GOOD LUCK....|`|AwHC8xdFaa	hun, the only way to get him to notice you is for you to make the first move. It seems like hes shy too so honestly I know you don't want to hear it but you can keep on waiting for him to make the move or one days you'll just have to get the guts to go up and introduce yourself<br>  <br>  try to find something you have in common that will help conversation flow|`|RNphimj4aa	Maybe your intimidating. I used to ask myself the same question in high school, and the year I graduated two different guys came up to me and told me that they had always wanted to ask me out, but didnt because they were intimidated by me. Maybe have one of your friends talk to him first? and see if he has any feelings towards you.|`|gxEBj6gcaa	if he was staring at you then he might've been thinking about it but this is the problem about guys, most guys think that a girl should start a conversation or at least the girl needs to give him clues that you are interested in him then he will make the approach <br>  this is all i could say hope it helps|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Why would he want to talk to you when he was having a bit of a go and you ignored him? And as you're not to going to talk, smile at him!|`|sYO70GJRaa	He might like you and be nervous as well. <br>  Smile, say "Hey, how are you going?" but make it sound casual, not like you are too eager to talk. <br>  <br>  If you are still too scared, smile at him and wave when you see him.|`|uUAxK6hNaa	Smile at him, then he probably start chatting. Or do any of your friends know him? If yeah get them to talk to him and then you can start chatting to him as well :)|`|6a8Ydw5Zaa	omg just say hi or keep staring and looking away at him|`|bE1XFBfraa	Acknowledge him with a "Hi" or something next time. Then maybe a conversation might start.|`|7QDYWAkfaa	If you can't even build up the courage to say hey, it's probably not meant to be.|`|LRke7SdKaa	just say hi and let him start the conversation or when he goes near you say did you want to talk?|`|iIOJxjvUaa	smile at him and look approachable then he's more likely to come up to you, its all about body language|`|xloBbwVBaa	text him!<br>  talk to his best friend!<br>  leave a anonymous note in his locker!|`|3zK8O9Zmaa	just ******* say hi...god.....|`|CSyBGcLYaa	write him a letter ,put it in his locker.|`|RUL7xdHHaa	just b like hi my name is (your name) whats up|`|Wzh2thjtaa	It sounds like he's probably scared too. Smile at him when you see him so that he's not so intimidated by you. If you acknowledge him first (you don't HAVE to speak first) then he'll know that you're not going to shut him down when he tries to talk to you next time!|`|m1r1PnJfaa	He was going to talk to you but a guy won't talk to a girl if she doesn't notice him would you go talk to a guy who looked like they would hurt you if you talked to them|`|QgnuaD6daa	i think he was going to talk to you but his bro probably told him to come on just wait on him to come to you is all you can do|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	well keep waiting|`|spYJU36Iaa	I think he was, maybe give him a little eye contact every now and again, so he knows you know hes there. :)<br>  Hang near him at breaks, maybe some of your friends are friends with his friends? If they are, its a good way to get your friendship groups interacting, and then you'll get more comfortable around him. xx|`|b2e454d13dcb8c58423bb1cc2b44f33caa	Really hard to say, not enough information... and even though you said dont.. well here it goes...<br>  <br>  Atleast say "Hi"..... ATLEAST, and if anything he would of responded to that....|`|8SRjELNBaa	Make yourself seem approachable.  Look him in the eye and mouth "hey".|`|YQYMPGK3aa	sounds to me he was about to attack.|`|9BY5kPukaa	He's a scaredy cat, lol...sounds like he is afraid of girls or girls that he likes...don't know what else to say, unless you break the ice, there is no other way...unless you get into a situation with him nearby that he has to talk to you...like fake fainting in front him or something, lol...he should be able to ask you if your "okay", if not you're in big trouble with this kid..|`|AA10682878	Say hi to him he may of wanted to talk to you if you cant say hi just try to smile or wave maybe he'll say hi and strike up a conversation.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Dannii?x|`|nioINr3Faa	He might've been about to talk to you.  But he might not've talked to you because he was too shy or changed his mind last minute.  And you might not want to hear this, but you might as well talk to him.|`|SfludeD5aa	Sounds like he wants to talk to you but he's nervous too. Next time he's near you "accidentally" drop your pencil and see if he picks it up for you, if he does look him in the eyes and just say thanks|`|jgULvu3Yaa	well the only choice you have is to talk to him cause you will never know till you talk to him.|`|bj4kbuaFaa	If he likes u he will talk just give him time.|`|v2qKmtY2aa	well i always use the strategy of ignore till he/she talks....what u do is ignore him until he misses talking to you...than he will be the one chasing after you|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	because u won`t talk to him
A2Ne8sdFaa	You and your friend need to talk to her. Hang out with her one time. Talk Calmy, no yelling or arguing. Tell her if she raises her voice you guys wont respnd, and then tell her "{name here}, you've changed. I'm not saying thats bad or anything, but you have just been kind of rude lately. And i dont think i can handle it! Always making rude comments and telling us what to do, if you keep it up, i dont think we even want to hang out with you anymore. "|`|sDqJIT5Paa	i am guessing you are in high school or something like that and if you aren't well sorry. lol but me and my friends are the same i have found that if your friends act like this they are not your true friends.. i would talk to her about it and if she is not caring then you two have just grown apart. hope i helped.|`|YbnEr1z7aa	she wants the attention, shes not getting it from home, so let her feel like shes in charge for a while and she will cool down|`|I0rTPsN4aa	Shout back & Ask her to keep it down. If needed a Double Punch by Both of u Can be used as Tonic. Thats How I would have done.|`|dcd11iUwaa	tell her to lighten up or get lost!
lC1VVt96aa	One of the things that you really need to do is go to the places that "the right kind of girl" would spend time.  If you want a girl of a particular religion, you should go to her Church.  If you want a drinking buddy, go to bars and night clubs.  Volunteer to help in various causes.  Just get out and about where people your age and generation are.|`|jj6wschXaa	i'm with you on this one buddy .... i just cant find anyone right either :(
G50ucmllaa	No, they would probably have a blast!  I am a teacher and while I did not invite my students (I had 120 at the time) I know teachers who have invited their homeroom classes...go for it!|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I do not think it would inappropriate at all. In fact, it might offend them if they are not invited. However, because it is out of town, they may or may not be able to attend, but it's always good to give an invitation to all the significant people in your life. If you feel they are significant and would like them to attend, invite them!|`|crxbob5jaa	It wouldn't be inappropriate, but I doubt I would do it. It might make the parents who could afford it take their kids and other children couldn't attend. I just think it might be better to have a small party for them after the wedding and call it a Girl Scout reception with a cake and punch. One of my daughter's teachers did that for her students and they felt so important.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	They're important to you, right?  I say invite them.  What's the worst that will happen - the parents won't be able to travel, right?  They'll still feel special for being invited. I imagine 9 year old girls are VERY excited about their leader getting married  (I can hear the peals of laughter now).  I know my pee wee cheerleaders would have been ecstatic to receive an invitation to a wedding.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Not inappropriate, perhaps impractical.  Invite anyway.  Just be sure to invite the parents, then include the children.  The parents must see that they will be in charge of their own children.  They can't just drop them off and pick them up later.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	You could invite them to the ceremony if you are not sure about the reception. My SiL invited her lacrosse team to the ceremony but not the reception since they were all underage and she didn't want the responsibility. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JnWzHVnEaa	If you invite the parents as well, I don't see how it could be inappropriate!  That is very generous of you inviting 18 extra people to your small wedding.  I'm sure they would be delighted!|`|ge3meKYEaa	No, I think it would be nice but I would assume most would not be able to attend.|`|1Na7uSiXaa	I think it would be great,  If you really want to make them feel special include them in your wedding by letting them be flowers girls.  Nothing is cuter then have a bunch of little girls walking down just before you and your children.  Also you don't have to ask to many others to stand up with you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your special day and very nice to think of the girls.|`|cgQqHJtKaa	Nothing wrong with it. Of course you are inviting their parents too, right? <br>  <br>  Perhaps all of them would not be able to come, but the ones that would, it would be wonderful for them. And they would love being invited.|`|4fe7aff6fc9d1806e4060e8d88d58d4aaa	I think it is a cute idea and am sure the girls would love it -- nice idea to include them and their parents.|`|aipChC3haa	If you are close to them, then go ahead =)<br>  This is your wedding, go ahead and pick whatever makes you happy.|`|3Hj5Vu5maa	No it would not be inappropriate. You would be inviting their parent's as well, right? As long as they have supervision it should be fine. Congrats and good luck :)|`|iDfRTLklaa	That's very sweet of you to want to included them in your wedding.  So I don't think it would be inappropriate at all to invite them.|`|7V0pxFe2aa	it would be really nice to invite them though.  you'll be busy focusing on other things instead of that individual!  congratulations on your wedding!  best wishes!|`|4VE5hQIhaa	is your wedding  and is your decision who you like to invited.|`|AA11307565	No simply put,it would not.|`|RrDZ6g4oaa	I think it wouild be nict to do that,|`|hkwBR1moaa	If you invite one, you should invite all.  I think it's a nice gesture.  You want the people who are closest to you to share in your special day, so if they are close, then sure!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Invite them!<br>  <br>  Even if they can't come, the honor of being invited is something those 9 year old brownies will remember forever.|`|AA10975867	Ordinarily i would say yes, but because your wedding is out of town, that might create a problem for some. As a troop leader, I know that you are teaching your girls about fairness and equality. If you invite them all, some families may not be able to afford a trip out of town and so your girls might miss out due to economics and feel "less than the others". Times are really tough right now and you can't hope to know about everyone's financial burdens. If your wedding is close enough so an overnight in hotel is not required, that might work but I am wondering about an alternative solution. Why not call a meeting of the mothers, tell them how close you are to their girls and tell them your quandry, You might say that you want to invite them all but, as the cost may be prohibitive and it has to be all or nothing, would they consider having a mini-bachelorette party for you and your girls. You could have it on a Friday night, do the beauty spa things like grownup girls, serve snacks and a pretty cake, orange juice with club soda and cherries in the glass, a great movie that is G-rated, maybe "Ever After" as that has a romantic theme, popcorn, and even a sleepover. You could show the girls your wedding shoes and veil and jewellery and give them each one of the favors you would have given them if they had attended the wedding. Make an album, take loads of pictures. You could even play the bride game, put them in pairs of two, give them 2 rolls of toilet tissue and some tape and let them design and model a wedding gown for you. The girls would remember this night all their lives and so would you.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	I say go for it, keep in mind they may not be able to attend due to it being out of town (depends how far), but it's nice to invite them all anyways.|`|AA10719818	I think it would be a really sweet gesture to invite them!<br>  <br>  Congrats on your wedding and good luck!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	No, but it would be super funny lol
8vfCRg7Caa	you tell that boyfriend of yours to giving away all our secrets. Ofcourse. Thats why its so hard to just stop when somebody says no or i dont feel like it. Duh. Why else would they keep pushing it after you said no.|`|dItZAwI2aa	oh boy, what a loaded question...it goes with the question why do gals feel the need to c** when a guy fingers them, why do gals have such a strog urge to do that when they are turned on...what is the purpose of them having such a strong urge to do that.<br>  <br>  its the way we are. i'd be more worried if he didn't have any urges when u perform the deed...that should be a bigger red flag than this.<br>  <br>  mebbe wanna try reading up on sex in the local library, it may hold answers to questions beyond your wildest dreams.|`|n5r57gPHaa	some do|`|j44s2gqAaa	You can't leave a bloke hanging, its just not fair :) yes i think we all do, its just a desire to get finished off i guess :)|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	When i'm turned on I  have to ejaculate or i'll be like a ***** on the rag until i do.|`|vTra7n5baa	Of course men do!  The purpose is sexual release.  It's the same when women want to orgasm or get wet.|`|uXW5Kx0Caa	evolution  men feel the need to ejaculate when they get turned on this is true for most men... this means the man also wants to have sex and if we were wild  this woulld mean that hed find a mate and they would produce offspring ... <br>  also a interesting evolution about the females <br>  when an animal female is ready to have a baby in the "time if the month" their nipples swell up to form breasts but in humans the nipples  are constantly swollen (boobies) this gives of the primal signal that every time is a good time to make a child  it all comes down to creating children and the cycle of life :)|`|6a8Ydw5Zaa	no not all the time|`|4XXaxereaa	evolution! if men didnt feel the need to *** then there would be hardly any people around, its an unconcious urge|`|CVvYhEfGaa	....this...this is a very random question.<br>  <br>  but i think they do. as for why, i do not know.|`|QGrIn7MXaa	some do and i don't no y just male nature|`|FpjccneWaa	i really dont know cuz my man does not do that!!!!!!!!!

RvddYKqjaa	Maybe he's feeling just a bit smothered. You can't and shouldn't change how much you care about him. I guess you have to limit showing it though. <br>  Little kids pull away when you hover too much. They need to make mistakes and straighten them out on their own. I wonder if we ever really grow out of that. <br>  Give him more space. Keep caring!  Divorce should never be an option unless everything humanly possible has been tried. I do hope he will stop being so distant. You have to keep communicating.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Sometimes is hard to see the boundaries mother-wife relationships. They need a supportive wife not an overprotective mother. Is not the same thing. Marriage is about 2 individuals getting together, not blending or melting in one. That could become suffocating. Try to make your life more interesting by doing new thing and facing new challenges, husbands appreciate that more than being around them all the time-|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	I am just like you & it's killing me.

We have overbearing nurturing instincts & it's as if people don't need that?<br>  <br>  Or we're mixing with the wrong ones.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Smothering someone is not healthy.  When you have a healthy love, each person has their own identity, their own interests and life.  It's my nature to love deeply and passionately too, but I have my own life and I don't make my life all about my husband.  I would read some books on dependent women or dependent personalities.  Get counseling.  Figure out how not to revolve so much of your time around your husband.   You end up pushing him away that way, because it's not an attractive feature to have.  A plant needs water, but if you smother in it water, it likely dies.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	This is what happens when you love someone more then they love you it's obvious that your husband doesn't love you as much as you love him. Sounds like he could be suffocating from to much "TLC" back off stop given him what you think he needs.|`|u6BNPURKaa	Please go out and get a copy of "Women Who Love Too Much"<br>  <br>  This book changed my life, and it sounds like it will change yours as well.|`|5QGx3FE1aa	Hard question to answer, If you need some real advice you should check out this site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://RelationshipHelpTips.info" rel="nofollow">http://RelationshipHelpTips.info</a>|`|A8YUlTimaa	Ur lying!!! U just chasing him a lot...|`|X9URbXTLaa	i don't think your nature is your problem, i think it might be the way your um, expressing it. some guys need they're space once in a while. However the fact that your not sustaining yourself is a problem too, as my dad always says "take care of yourself first, then others otherwise how will you be able to care for that person?" My dad suffered from depression so i know what your going through=P maybe once in a while go out with friends or something but dont hover over your husband too much. i really am out of ideas all i can say is as long as you feel your doing the right thing keep at it (just dont get annoying) oh maybe you both could go see a theripist? just a thought...i really hope you and your husband can work it out! good luck! <br>  <br>  <br>  Maya =P|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Caring about someone isn't bad.  <br>  <br>  Smothering them is.<br>  <br>  You can't change your nature, but you can change how you act it out.  Give him some space.  Loving someone means loving them in a way that is meaningful to them, not what makes you happy.  If he needs you back off, show him your love and respect for his needs by backing off.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	He's basically telling you to loose up the leash and back off! <br>  <br>  so do it.
VsaEOX9vaa	Hey, a lot of people think that squirrels are really cute. Perhaps that's how he meant it to sound, that you look CUTE like a squirrel?|`|qCG2byqlaa	I think that was kinda rude and inconsiderate of him to say. He probably wasnt thinking of how you would take it.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Grab his nuts.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	Tell  him that's why you like him. cuz he's NUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NKbCmlQ2aa	Don't take it seriously.

rWB3ClKZaa	Make fun of them for listening to new crap artists like the Jonas Brothers or Miley cyrus or some other talentless singer and some other current new artists that are killing the music industry<br>  <br>  p.s. madonna is hardcore|`|aZvzGTUBaa	Just tell them you like madonna, not that you hate her. If they are your real fans, they'll understand. If they don't drop them, they're not good enough to be your friend.|`|iYM7Jacyaa	if they ask tell them... ya i like madonna! is there a problem with that? and if they say yes and they don't want to be your friends anymore well then they are not real friends. and just saying but you shouldn't have lied in the first place|`|0OWnHFEXaa	Leave your ipod at home, delete her songs, or face it.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be embarrassed by something you like.  If its something you enjoy, don't let others ruin it or you'll be trying to please others your whole life instead of yourself.<br>  <br>  Just come out and say hey yea I like Madonna when you and your friends are in a conversation.  Just because they don't like it doesn't mean you can't like it.  If they have a problem with it, then it's their problem.  Real friends don't control each other.

NKjmsZz9aa	he's so likes you<br>  and if he doesnt then he is in love with you<br>  all these details sound like love at fate<3|`|qcvjUgHzaa	The best way to find out is to ask him yourself.<br>  <br>  OR, have a friend of his/yours ask him for you. When he finds out that you like him, see how he reacts. <br>  <br>  If he ignores you, that means he doesn't really like you the same way and doesn't know how to react to it. (And don't waste your time, if he does this, he is a JERK)<br>  <br>  If he confronts you and tells you he just wants to be friends, that means exactly what it means. (At least he was nice about it)<br>  <br>  And of course, he could flirt back with you, and you know what that means! :D|`|z0tk6XSvaa	he likes you.|`|D5UAhY8jaa	ok thats wierd|`|PJaNDUmWaa	Probably.<br>  <br>  But then again, you idiots constantly leave out information and make me ask if he had shown any other sign.|`|qa1GWK5Yaa	I once read you dreams are ur innermost desires and if that is true he is intrested.|`|5BmnSiqUaa	.<br>  Come on!<br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  He's totally in to you.<br>  <br>  What more do you want, a written invite?<br>  .<br>  .<br>  Good Luck.<br>  .<br>  .|`|I63igrrOaa	lol, i dont think so.<br>  <br>  ?<br>  answer mine plz;<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtX.UULS09jCwb87OB4rKxfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308180230AA2R8Gm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Period. If you didn't want to hurt your friend, then why are you with her ex? Kiss your friendship goodbye.
LYnK4xb0aa	no|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	just  say hi, hows things going and let him decide how much of what he wants to talk about...it shows caring, without sounding nosy|`|6tW2DFYSaa	There's nothing wrong talking to him again. If he wants to be friends with you go for it.
K6XCsD8eaa	well i am a freshman too and i had the same situation about five months ago. I liked a junior, everyone told me he was a player and my friend was his ex:/ first, i talked to her to make sure it was ok with her. once she was fine with it i decided that if i never gave it a shot i would never no if it was going to work out. I did it.... and we are still together:) take a chance, you never no.|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|angW1Lkfaa	It's the chance you talk history has shown guys can say just about anything to get you in their clutches you just have to take that risk to see how real they are and you need tok now how to get out of it if he's a player. If he's a player how long do you think he'll hang on if he's after one thing. You could be right there are many beaten and battered women <br>  who say they love him. Take a chance just go into with your eyes wide open, he'll let you now soon enough.|`|AA11384763	ok your a freshman in high school. if you go out with him, and break up then who cares, and a player, u don't have to do anything with him, when he askes u, just say no, and if he gets mad then he obiously dosent like you so whats there to make a big deal about this|`|9BY5kPukaa	Yes, he is lying.  You know all this negative stuff about him, so why do you want to get into a relationship with someone like this? I think once he has sex with you, he will dump you, just a gut feeling from what you wrote.  The choice is yours, but I would move on if I were you...|`|823Z8NH3aa	If he just started to flirt with you suddenly, no little hints before, and he's already told you he likes, he's a player.|`|enuZI9ibaa	I think that he likes you but he doesn't want everyone to know cause he is a "player" or you like him and he is just going to hurt you, i always say if he like you enough he will ask you out. good luck with him. : )))|`|nTHKx9tgaa	Hey kid, re-read what you just told me. Its inevitable that there is some fling there. I think its worth a try to trust him and try a relationship. Just think about this, you can't wonder what got away from you if u give it a try. (coming from a junior in high school)|`|MmdWM51faa	usally guys dont usally play around when they say that they like you. unless they want sex from you. its a dignity thing.|`|K4UBu9neaa	Not everything you hear about people is true, since rumors do get spread and people can change.  If his reputation is that he doesnt want a relationship, it might be because he usually doesnt have them , never wanted them before, or keeps them secret.<br>  If he said he wants one with you that is most likely a good sign so go for it with him BUT watch out if he tries to keep the fact that hes dating u a secret.  That is a bad sign, if he wants to be with u he should be proud to let other ppl know, even if it upsets the occasional person like your ex.  Keeping a relationship secret will keep it from becoming healthy and other girls will continue to hit on him without realizing hes taken!
YYAmBsvXaa	is she asian? well she might of been acting like she was more interested in the car so she could have something to talk about.
JkvlAVX2aa	Yes.  I, for one, have forgiven my ex's (more than one) for cheating (more than once).<br>  <br>  Did it hurt each time?  Of course.  But I manage to find my unique way of getting over it because I realize that NOT all people who cheated must be chastised and condemned for good.<br>  <br>  We all have questionable behaviors once in a while and cheating happens to be one out of many questionable behaviors that human may have.  There are still other good qualities that a cheater may have.<br>  <br>  I just don't think it's fair to write off a person completely only because he/she has cheated.  The focus should be on "why" and "what" motivated that person to cheat.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I don't think anyone ever truly forgives a cheater. It's the worst betrayal you can do in a marriage, and it spells the end of the road for me. Too bad all innocent spouses don't feel that way, maybe there would be less cheating then.|`|an1EMiFkaa	Nope...at least I havent been forgiven.|`|IvMPh09baa	whats wrong.. did you cheat on your man, and now your sorry????|`|K6JSNQJQaa	I think that's a question you might want to ask yourself.  Would you ever forgive a man?  Forgiveness is the thing to do I suppose if the other person is truly sorry but after that I think the trust issue is gone.  Don't you?|`|9QeV07zJaa	There is Forgive and there is Forget.<br>  Forgiving is almost a Faith oriented thing so it varies from person to person.<br>  <br>  We don't forget.|`|5QGx3FE1aa	You can't trust someone that cheats on you, most likely there just going to do it again!<br>  <br>  Here is a great website that can help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://RelationshipHelpTips.info" rel="nofollow">http://RelationshipHelpTips.info</a>|`|0ox8VKwKaa	If the underlying cause is fully exposed, understood and resolved with sincere remorse and forgiveness. The offending party has to achieve equal status eventually otherwise it won't work|`|8ci0XtIWaa	people can forgive but you will never ever forget and thats where the problem lies the mind will go there and bring the hurt up again and again.|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	Not just men, does anyone? It depends on the person.|`|S6BYJ4Jfaa	No|`|dItZAwI2aa	i never have and never will. trust is earned not a given. someone who breaks that trust can't be trusted not to do it again. fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.|`|hs793CCxaa	Probably as much as women do!<br>  <br>  How would YOU get the trust back? Would you ever FULLY trust that person again? Probably not....<br>  <br>  It's not "messing around" it's CHEATING! That's bad.
ZehXcyA2aa	it may sound silly but when a guy tells you he likes you its usually true
FZKFLTyLaa	You raised this son, and he's picked up on your values I trust. If he is so hard hearted you must accept what little aid he proffers and be satisfied with that,<br>  Becoming more beggarly will only further distance him I fear.
n336SjRiaa	I have the same problem. my last boyfriend, if he tried to smooth talk me, or compliment me, i'd shove it out the window because i just think he is so full of it. i see no honestly. i just dont believe it, i dont know why, or how to help it. but i think maybe its an advantage, girls get persuaded so easily and end up pregnant and feeling stupid. if ppl are as realistic as we are, probably less likely to get hurt, pregnant, or anything else.|`|IW592N5Zaa	You shouldn't feel like you can't trust all guys, but watch out for a particular kind of guy...if hes too interested in being physical, then thats a warning sign...|`|0PHXVRMYaa	dnt trust no one . be prepared for the hardest issues dont put yur self outt there play hard too get see how the guys reacts to it|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Just tell him no sex until you are married and it won't be a problem.Get to know them before you date them.|`|3a74f8e968179db88a366eba81b6d2e0aa	OK, you have trust issues, and they're probably justified.<br>  <br>  If a guy takes an interest in you, then you have to take an interest in them as well to date or whatever.  What about taking an interest in a different kind of guy than you usually do?<br>  <br>  If there's things you like to do in your spare time, find a group that does it.  If a guy takes an interest in you there, then at least  you have something in common.
xDlBM6N6aa	Yeah you're good looking, not gonna lie.
KtR0NstMaa	Not sure but try giving them a hug.  It will make you feel better and it lets them know that you too care.   Give it a try.
dX4Dll0yaa	It really depends on how comfortable you are. If you are not 100% comfortable (either with the fingering or blowing him) don't do it. He should respect that (and if he doesn't, time to move on). (Fisting is inserting your fist instead of a finger)|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Courtney not only no but hell no. You have all kinds of time before you start having sexual relations. Why would you even want to give a guy a ********? What if he has a sexually transmitted disease like herpes or hiv. When he say he wants to fist you it means he wants to make a fist and push it inside your vagina. I bet that would feel real good. Dump this asshole and find a nice guy.|`|OlK0Pa1Gaa	Wow, he's obviously a pervert.<br>  Don't let him finger you just because he is asking. Do it when you are comfortable and if like him enough. He is obviously only asking you so he can tell all his male friends he fingered you. It's not like he gets pleasure from fingering you it's just his finger it's not like he gets excited.<br>  If I were you I'd say don't do it. Make him wait for it. I'm a 16 year old guy so I know what I'm talking about. I'm sure you are younger since you don't know what fisting means. It means he will put his whole fist inside of you. Yeah, he's a jerk.<br>  Vote me best answer :D Because, it obviously is the best.|`|l2h1191Qaa	No, you shouldn't. If you have to go onto a website and ask, then no. You should only let him do it if you're completely sure you want it. You don't have to do anything you don't want to with him.<br>  <br>  And fisting is where they stick their fist in your vagina or ***. Trust me, I don't think you'll like it. There's only a select few who do, and most of them are porn stars.|`|WGVHKF7Aaa	Well really it depends if your old enough for sex and if you think you have been with him for enough time. So really, its your choice.<br>  <br>  My suggestion - Wait until you are married, its for the best.<br>  <br>  And fisting is not just a finger, its his whole hand and part of his arm...<br>  I say you dont let him, in fact I would break up with him its somewhat rude and odd. <br>  <br>  Help me? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvKmsBGPfr5kUvfJaocZSc_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226195044AAozDaq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|IIKwBSrxaa	Fisting is when a guy sticks his fist up your *****.<br>  <br>  Tell him he can only finger you if you don't have to blow him first.

yFBKkcqLaa	It sounds like she is not really into your crush or bf she is just doing it to annoy you. Sibling rivary especially sisters is so common, its unbelievable. Its not till you grow up that you develop a friendship and it is usually when one of you leave home. I think you should just ignore her, because she is just doing it for a rise and you are rising to the occasion everytime. I know it can be hard to ignore but without rising to it she will eventually get bord and leave you alone or the other thing you can do is to do it to her, but only leave that as a last minute solution because she wouldnt expect that of you<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	She's only doing this to upset you.

Your kind of being a little selfish here to.|`|WYi0rkU8aa	"i just want her to leave me alone" dont wish for that it might come true and for the case of your sister she looks up to you, ur the bigger sister she wants to be you, everything you have is better because your the bigger sister.  to tell you the truth you just have to deal it and wait until she gets old enough and the mean time dont let her get away from anything always tell her its worng, if u dont she wont know.  <br>  <br>  goddluck big sister lol. dont tell her the people u like

DcrI9zmkaa	You have bigger things to worry about than a text message.  If you're so concerned, call him.|`|K9Bcqloqaa	Honey, you are going to have a baby.  A child that will need their mother in the best of health and mind.  If you feel that you can't provide for your child, than please give up to adoption.  Allow that child to be brought up with a mature adult rather than an adult who hasn't matured.  If your babys' daddy doesn't want to be part of the childs life, than let it be.  You can't change his mind.  Live your own life, and let him live his own.  You need to take care of your body and mind, and wear protection if you are going to be "going out" with a boy.  I'm not being mean, I just want you to realize that your decisions not only affect you, but everyone connected to you.|`|wdntZl92aa	He's obviously not caring about you.

I wouldn't want my kid to have a father that is worthless.|`|24012ce93a61f006e2d2c809881dd85aaa	Get that abortion or arrange for an adoption after the baby is born. I can tell by your message that you're nowhere near ready to be a parent. If this text thing is stressing you out, having a baby will kill you. Your boyfriend is absent, and if you're dating "boys", then you must be very young, too young to be a good mom. Don't do it.|`|mMByiHaQaa	I would get an abortion because you want you baby to have his father there for him don't you?<br>  You want a father that will be commited to the baby and it would be best to wait for a father who wants the baby...|`|4dXcZhuTaa	walk away and do what you need to do for you.. baby or no baby.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	Don't sweat him! Take care of yourself and baby and in your spare time if you have any try and see what the deal is.  Do not waste your time because if he wanted to be there he would have still been around like he was when you first got together.  Its common in man to act funny at this stage in a relationship.  Find you someone better and file for child support if you have to.

There have been so many times where i have just laid beside my phone all night waiting for a text.

Its your baby and your choice if you want an abortion or not.

1dbcab4a9e9431d3bcdcc1d8cf2e2e24aa	It isn't bad for the girl to call the boy.  However, I would consider your situation overall.  Assuming your boyfriend is telling the truth about being grounded, it could be a sign that this might not be a good person for you.  He could just have overly strict or possessive parents- you didn't mention your age but perhaps they think he and/or you are too young to be dating.  As for lying or making excuses, there are ways to assess this.  When you talk to him in school, is he enthusiastic and happy or quick to walk away?  Have you heard any rumors, or seen him with other girls?  Many guys have trouble being straight up with those they date, and they don't exactly want any drama or confrontation in the mix either.  Chances are, if you end up going your separate ways, you'll have to be the one to pull the plug.|`|dX4Dll0yaa	If he is your boyfriend, it is not bad for you to call him.

On the other hand, she could be a crazy person who's after you... but if she was that, why hasn't she found you yet? I think she just wants to talk to you. I sure would!|`|llEdx8Q2aa	What benefit could come of it? I do not think it is a good idea. If you and the married man are done then that is it. Period.

You deserve your own man, but I'm afraid that "what goes around, comes around" sooner or later. When you play, sooner or later you've got to pay. <br>  The question is how will you feel when your husband betrays you? Will you have something that you would like to say to the other woman in your man's life? I bet you will!|`|RKhSRMlZaa	The only beef the wife should have is with her HUSBAND.  Not you.  Yes, you played a part in the whole thing but it isn't your relationship that is affected.  Her husband is the only one who should be accounting for what he's done in his relationship.  You should not be contacting the wife.  Let her know that you have no desire to speak with her and you will have nothing more to do with her husband.  From that point on, it's in her hands whether or not she would like to forgive him.<br>  <br>  After reading the answers above I honestly don't know why any wife would want to talk to the woman her husband had an affair with.  If my husband cheated on me I would never want to see that woman's face unless she was a close personal friend or relative of mine.  Otherwise, it would only hurt worse.  And what's the point of validating the husband's story?  he's already lied and cheated once, why would one validation make it any different?  Personally I think the two women should stay away from each other.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	I really don't think it's a good idea for you to meet with her. As others have said, her husband is the one who went outside of their relationship (which doesn't exonerate you, but there it is). <br>  <br>  If you do decide to talk to her, let her know up front that you know you did wrong. Don't meet her alone - insist on having a friend there if you need to get away quick.

Keep in mind, YOU hurt HER and her marriage. #! i think she wants to get a look at you, she is after all a female. #2 she needs to vent and get whats on her mind off. #3 The wife should probally leave her husband, because he a pig. once a cheater always a cheater.

She just needs to vent. It won't be pretty, but you have to pay to play.|`|AA11496527	Try this; have a prearranged phone conversation with her. Let her know your concerns about rumors and the around town thing you mentioned, don't hesitate to tell her of your shame but will defend yourself if she attempts to run you down in public or otherwise (personally I think she wants closure or help to make up her mind regarding her next step in her married life). Depending on how the short phone conversation goes, you can determine if you think it would help if you spoke to her in person. If you perceive she has sinister motives for having a face to face, simply tell her your not comfortable with her attitude towards you and have a great life. <br>  <br>  Yes you made a mistake and it won't be your last, but hopefully you won't make another one this big. So get on with your life, if you can help someone get their head straight, be a good person by helping and not looking for the bad up front.  Really good luck.|`|NKbCmlQ2aa	My step father cheated on my mother for nearly a year. A sex only thing too. My mother found out about the affair by answering his cell phone for him one night and another woman asked for him that she had never heard of. She started looking through is phone more and listening to voice mails while he was out. Finally he confessed. My mom spoke with the other woman, which would be you in this case. and the woman told the truth and my mother and her were respectful towards each other and nothing was ever said again about it. My mother and step father divorced over it. But My mom doesn't blame the woman. She blames her husband.

All u can do is tell her the truth, she wont expect anythin else from u,thats all u can give her, Hope ive hepled a little!|`|z6IekuwSaa	I would talk to her. In public or on the phone, so your safe in case she's psycho. I just really thin it is only fair since you may have helped end her marriage. Answer everything honestly unless she asks if you loved him and if he loved you. Then lie for her sake. Say that you loved him but he didn't love you, only her. It just might be the only way she can heal is by talking to you<br>  <br>  Also watch out. If the marriage ends in some states a wife can sue the other woman for destroying her marriage. She could sue you for loss of benefits she had in her marriage including his salary and insurance. I think it's called alienation. I can't remember.

Some people never end up telling their true feelings for the fear of losing them. I was one person that never told this girl who was my friend how I really felt. She is no longer in my life now for we went our separate ways but, I still regret that I never got to tell her how I feel. I would do anything to tell her but anyway, you did and you lost your friend. Now you know how he feels so don't bug him and just move on. Trust me it is better that he knew instead of just keeping it inside of you hoping of something that will not happen in the end. At least you know that nothing can happen. So I congratulate you again and good luck.|`|xyW8PsfUaa	Just tell him how u feel and how u just want to be friends and ask him what you can do to pretend that that never happened.

OHfZFR31aa	Actually, you are entitled to half of the gifts you received for your wedding. So spite her by demanding half of everything - 4 out of the 8 wine glasses you got, half of the towels, half of the crystal candy bowls, etc. You probably don't really care about gifts, but she is going to be very upset she's not getting the full set of dinner plates, champagne flutes, etc.<br>  <br>  Then you can be the big man and return your half of the gifts to the people who bought them so they can try to get a refund, and they will think your wife is a selfish b**ch for not doing the same thing<br>  <br>  She will not have to pay your lawyers fees.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Legally that is not true. My guess is that she will try to annul the marriage making it cheap and fast.<br>  <br>  There is not one law stating the person walking away has to pay the person's lawyer fees and stuff. If that was true, battered spouses running away and divorcing would be SOL. <br>  <br>  Not one bit of truth to that.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The best revenge is to be happier and more fullfilled then her. Remember: Karma will come back to you, what goes around comes around. So be kind no matter how hurt you are and you will be better off in the end and will go to bed knowing you did all you can do to be the adult.<br>  <br>  And the same thing goes for her, Karma will bite her in the butt.|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	There's me really wanting to marry my man - then I read this.

AA10604036	Leave the information off the invitations, it cheapens them.  <br>  <br>  DO put something on the reply cards though.  Something subtle but firm like <br>  "We look forward to seeing the (invited # of guests) of you there" or "(# of) places have been reserved for you".  Some people use the phrase "Adult Reception" but if you're inviting 11 year-olds that may not work for you.<br>  <br>  Follow proper invitation addressing etiquette and don't be shy about letting those close to you know they're welcome to spread the word about your age limits to the families on your guest list, some folks really do need it spelled out for them...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|MxuxpF3Waa	That would be something to put in the wedding invitations|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	The wedding is for adults only.

The proper way to do it is only address the invite to those who are invited. If anyone rsvps for their kids, you need to call them up and tell them that kids can't attend. Is this a personal choice or is it something that your venue requires? Be prepared for some people to not attend because they feel you are playing favorites in that their 11 yr old (who may be immature) is allowed to attend while their 8 yr old (who is better behaved and quite mature for her age) isn't allowed. Unless it is a venue requirement, you risk creating unrepairable rifts and you can't be selective like that without coming across as rude. Where kids are involved, it's typically all or none.|`|Xcyaju2vaa	You stress the adult wedding-adult reception, etc. When you address the invitation you write MR & MRS.--nothing about and family, etc. You can also put the word out-gently-by talking to those who would tell her.

Maybe he has been hurt.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I've heard guys say that, like they are bragging about it all nonchalant, and my personal opinion on it is that guys who come out and SAY they don't like "chasing" or that they want to be chased by a girl instead, they want their egos stroked. Cocky types usually.<br>  <br>  Not saying anything is wrong with enjoying being pursued, but to brag about it means something else.|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	Either he is weird, or very conceited.  <br>  <br>  Answer mine please:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227125132AA4kTL3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Uh sounds like a guy..........the only reason more guys chase women other then vice versa is because 85% of what guys find attractive is looks.|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	He's not wierd. Alot of guys like agressive women. It makes them feel wanted and takes the pressure off of them asking a girl out just to get turned down, time after time.<br>  <br>  If you like him, go for it! Walk up to him the next time you see him and lay a big kiss on him.|`|6a8Ydw5Zaa	wth i dont chase no female|`|cggkcAC5aa	Lol he should be doing the chasing.<br>  It would be nice if you could help me too:<br>  =]<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226195145AATV4I3">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|H9xPksmAaa	It seems he respects woman... and possibly prefer they come to him?

Note that when you get older the popular kids will matter less and less, and half the kids taht were popular in middle school and highschool will be gross nobodies when they get older.  Yeah it really seems like he likes you. Just flirt, hopefully he'll ask you out.

up010iaraa	Firstly in my opinion it wouldn't be a good idea<br>  because<br>  a. if you and him did go out and got caught he would get the sack and would make it difficult for him to get another teaching job, also you may end up with a reputation (as that is what schools worldwide are like)<br>  <br>  b. you don't say, but he may be married/ have kids and turn you down. Then you'll be awkward around him, vice versa and it will be a right mess.<br>  <br>  I know it's not what you want to hear, but just keep it as a fantasy, it could have a nasty knock on effect if you try.|`|ONAgORxhaa	when your 18 and leaving,if you still want him ask him out.but ifyou date him now he could get fired.|`|TNOQk3Fjaa	Get over it. Thats nasty.

ki8P8bYfaa	How do you treat girls?  If you treat them with respect, great, if not, that's why.  How do you act in general?  Are you nice and stuff?  Personally, I like long hair (as long as it's not worn in a ponytail) and it doesn't matter if your "white" (I'm assuming you mean pale rather than white-haired and old).  Ask a girl out instead of just flirting.  Just flirting will get you nowhere, trust me.|`|AA10106002	be more aggressive|`|jA2VJXzFaa	guess your unlucky|`|RHIJ6OPQaa	really, just wait for the right girl to come along. i know it might seem like that's a long way ahead, but trust me, the right girl will come. you cant just go out with any random girl just so you'll have a date/girlfriend. just be yourslef around girls, and be nice :) im sure you'll find a great girl :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|UinOWcMUaa	You see.. it's because your looking to get hooked up... girls will find you out...

wv4rOWqZaa	Well, in all honesty...speaking of me at least...:<br>  <br>  I really like one girl now, because of 3 reasons I guess:<br>  <br>  - Her personality;<br>  - Her face;<br>  - There is something I can't explain...something else...<br>  <br>  Those 3 reasons are important among every guy I guess - BUT keep in mind that each one of them might compensate the rest :). For example...having a REALLY cool personality might compensate the fact that a girl isn't that beautiful. Or vice versa - a really beautiful girl might pay off the stupid personality :). <br>  Or...there might be something that can't be explained easily in words...which compensates both stupid behaviour and ugly face. <br>  <br>  And, yes, I do believe those 3 reasons perhaps are most important - I would say and "body" and "voice" too. But...the list above is better :).<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|ZehXcyA2aa	there are a lot of things i guess<br>  you say you flirt around a lot, if a guys into you and he sees you flirting with someone else its an instant turn off and a bit of a downer.<br>  honestly is a lovely quality aswell as a nice personality and looks can also be important.<br>  its a cliche but just be yourself, thats what i like in a girl.|`|AA11383443	When I was younger, I always loved a woman's smile.

LRke7SdKaa	see what he says on your messageing machine
Hn3aBIb1aa	i dont think the other people understood your question!!! I havent been in this situation so i cnt comment on tht part but from wat i understand from the question she wanted a baby and went behind your back by not takin the pill to get a baby with you. Now whether in her mind tht is coz she loves you (as the first reply said) she mite do but tht doesnt make wat she did right. And i think your perfectly in your right and did the right thing by dumping her even though shes pregnant. I also think youve been very genuine nice guy by stickin by the child and helpin it out etc wen the child is born :) well done most guys wudnt in this situation. <br>  As for how its affected you, i cnt begin to imagine what it must be like, but just keep tryin new things and keep the people closest to you tht beleive in you and know the old you as well as the you at the moment and hopefully in time things will get better and you will return to bein the you tht everyone loves bein around. Good luck|`|KGRikkJeaa	what was stopping you from breaking up with her before the baby? nothing right? Well, what made you do it now? If you like her then whyd you break it off? be a man, get back with the girl and raise that baby|`|mQdVYmTaaa	i think your in the wrong to dump her when u have a child on the way , she must have loved you and wanted this baby especally with you. but we all go thorugh stages in our lifes where we dont no what to do and the best option is out,  u need to relax abit and apprictate things u have. besides most kids need a father figure when growing up.|`|I0rTPsN4aa	I think u got her wrong buddy. She might have done this coz she's in love with u & wants to have a child with u. Should it be called a crime for her to wanna have a kid with u? Think again from a different prospect Man.
hBiKebSDaa	Follow your heart and don't rush things.  See how things progress.  Age is just a number when both people are mature.|`|N3qaHrmCaa	no love could never be wrong unless for some reason hes married, age difference really doesn't matter.  Make it clear to him that the difference doesn't bother you.|`|06Z3fh4laa	No. It's fine. I know when I'm with a girl I like, I never notice the age, whether it be months or years, it doesn't matter.|`|p93GnJzbaa	if you don't have a problem with the age then it shouldn't be a big deal. if you love him then that is all that matters.
JB9wqFFYaa	i think you should try to talk to her because it is obviously that she likes you :) girls are shy at the begining. so get some courage and talk to her :p good luck|`|d477vi6Aaa	you should really talk to her and maybe give her your number, but get to know her before you ask her out.|`|QgnuaD6daa	i think she likes you but just can't talk to you cause i felt the same way about this guy and then after getting to know each other we when out|`|6a8Ydw5Zaa	just spit to her and say "whats up...ya c u n t"  lol
vHxauOyeaa	Way too soon, way to scare a girl off most of the time. Its okay. Let it slide and if he asks why you don't reciprocate just tell him that you'll know when it is the right time to say it back to him.|`|UinOWcMUaa	He's a guy.. your lucky He even told you that !|`|3a74f8e968179db88a366eba81b6d2e0aa	It might be a little soon if you had only been dating for two weeks, but didn't have any of the history.  He knew you for a year, got to know you better after talking with you for two months, and now you've taken it the next step by dating.  He could very likely have developed some feelings for you over that time.<br>  <br>  You might possibly have misconstrued it, too; his love might be just a friendship type of love - the old "I-love-you-but-I'm-not-IN-love-with-you...  I know it made you feel awkward and, if the feeling isn't mutual, you can always say, "That's about the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me", throw your arms around him, and give him a kiss.<br>  <br>  The problem people constantly run into is that they don't really know what love is or what it feels like, so if they feel "differently" about someone, they figure it must be love.  It's quite likely he thinks he loves you, but doesn't really know what he's talking about.  And he may just be trying to get into your pants - you can never completely discount that.|`|ZPqDhHpyaa	The whole "i love you" thing is a little tricky. But i don't really believe in any time limits. If you love someone, you love someone- as simple as that. You've known him for a decent amount of time so maybe his i love you isn't necessarily a deeper- i can't live without you, you are my everything, blablabla- kind of love you but more of a simple- i love everything about you and being with you- kind of love.<br>  <br>  Focus on how he acts. Is he clingy? Overprotective? Obsessive? Does he get jealous easily? If he gives off any of those vibes you may want to slow things down because THEN it may mean he is taking things into overdrive. However, if things are normal between you guys there is nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  As far as your concerned, you answer him when YOU feel ready. Don't feel bad if you don't think it's the right timing, but don't be afraid to say it either.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|juczLKDEaa	Sense you guys have known each other for a while it's no too weird but still a little too soon. Don't feel bad about not saying it back. The worse thing you could do is say it and not mean it. Just tell him your not ready for that.|`|KHjYq2bHaa	What do you feel bad about? Do you feel bad about saying "I love you" back?<br>  <br>  IF you don't want to say it yet, then at least show that you care for him. It is too early to suggest anything at the moment. Let your relationship develop first before you ready for a long term commitment.|`|L5d1RtSeaa	I don't have a LOT of experience, but if it were me I would be caucious. If you love him you can say so, but don't get to attached and confindent in your relationship--it may be temporary. Love is a tricky thing that doesn't have just one deffinition. It is different for everyone. See, to YOU it may be that "love" is something that is very deep and only aplies to one man in your life. On the other hand, I also know some people who say that to all their boyfriends/girlfriends. To some people it is a term that either means "I care about you" or is just somthing you say to the person you're going out with. It is all in the way you take it. Just don't get to serious about him before you know how he "defines" love. :)|`|IW592N5Zaa	if you think it's too soon then it's too soon. tell him you don't know yet if you can genuinely say it back. tell him that it isn't anything personal and you like him a lot but you don't know if you love him because you don't really know him yet.|`|f9op7sEHaa	Put this as gentle as you can. Say so and so i really like you and all but its a little too soon to say i love you. I'm sure he will understand! P.S. if you choose this as your best answer don't! I can't let anyone see it. They end up reading it!|`|B91DUxNraa	Well, for some people, it takes time for love to bloom, for others, it's love at first sight. Maybe he's had his eye on you for a while. :P|`|JJMa25NWaa	it is a little soon. don't say it until you mean it. and tell him to cool down for a little.|`|0gCEVaEfaa	well tell him that he's getting a little to far and deep to be saying that yet but you still wanna date him and stuff... but just so you know its never to early or late to be saying i love you|`|ZSlaNKEkaa	If it doesn't feel right then don't say it.|`|2Am7tKR9aa	take him out and be nice.|`|aw9VIrPCaa	Hey :)<br>  <br>  Same thing happened to me, I had nothing to say either. But if he really does love you he will be ok with it and wait till your ready to say it back. You shouldn't feel forced. The reason I didn't love my partner just then it because of past relationships and learned not to give my all to someone in 2 weeks. Just wait.. I'm sure you'll feel the same just not so soon :) He should understand. Otherwise just say it to make him happy? lol!|`|76MNB4s8aa	I'd tell him exactly what you feel - that you really like him but you think its a  little too soon for "love".  Go on dates, enjoy each other.  You don't need to be in a hurry.  He should respect that.  If he pressures you, let him go.|`|OdsvxRbpaa	just say it back if you truly mean it. if your not ready to say that then just smile and hug him. i dont think its a little soon because if your dating each other he should love you. : ]|`|SfAoz2giaa	Ber eal. If you dont fel like you should say it , then tell him its going to fast if he says it again. If you really do like him then go for it|`|AA11704470	The truth shall come to the light!<br>  <br>  Always tell the truth, no matter how much it hurts.

a7PxMkXcaa	When your throat gets better, call him and tell him you'd like to TALK. If he doesn't get that, he's not right for you.  In the meantime, take care of yourself, your throat, and find something to do.   If you can't get your mind off him, write him an e-mail or somehing. Then go do something else. You didn't break up or anything.....<br>  <br>  Just make sure he's giving you enough attention that you're looking for. Is that what's botheirng you? If he is, you can look foward to seeing him and talking to him again soon.|`|WJ1kzLbBaa	I'm not a girl but i still want to help anyway.

Also eat some honey and lemon that will make your throat a bit better.|`|VHaSKFC2aa	What I used to do with my BF that lived farther away (and yeah I couldn't drive either) was I got a smallish notebook (something from Wal-mart that is a solid color tends to be better looking for this) and wrote in it.<br>  <br>   I would would write anything from how I was feeling that day, to what I did at school or work, about friends and family. I would write about my loves and fears, my inner thoughts, or favorite songs or books, or quotes. I would write about him and what made me like him, or what I plan to do with my life. Make it personal and special. Then send it to him in the mail, or, at the one time you do see him pass it onto him and tell him to write you back in it. <br>  <br>  Its a nice way to get to talk to eachother if you can't talk in real life, on the phone or computer. (Good for being grounded too lol) And its a good way to express some feelings and thoughts that you may not be fully comfortable saying out loud. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. :)|`|VPohcKwGaa	Do you have a phone? You should definitely text him. Have him send a picture of himself so you can look at his cute face :). If your parents wont drive you to see him then im sorry hun, there's nothing you can do but wait it out. Just think...you could cry because your not with him at the moment, or you could smile because your with him for good. :)) You'll see him eventually and missing him will only make it better when you do!

It works.<br>  =]|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	u went time with him   so tell him im u
DFSHoO4uaa	i think he could like u maybe for now he's getting to know you but your going the right way if you like him then you should just ask for his IM and talk 2 him there just make normal convos when u seem him and compliment him that will make him fall for u like mad! btw that's funny answer and i'll answer yours feel free 2 answer mine!|`|PCBQbQmraa	You may just want to ask him to a movie or do something sometime.  Then you can open up new doors.|`|OhhKRahTaa	Well you certainly are an angel.<br>  <br>  He likes you.
W89kmvxjaa	First off, you have to look at this situation differently. <br>  <br>  Your friend knows that you like your teacher, but I doubt she will do anything about it. What is she going to do? Walk up to him after class and say "hey, Mr. _____, guess who has a crush on you??!".  No, that would be very unnatural and completely stupid. I don't think anyone would want to do that. <br>  <br>  If for some reason your friend tells the teacher, it is unlikely he will act differently towards you. If he is a cute guy, i'm sure many girls have liked him. I hope he would be mature enough to handle the situation in a professional way. <br>  <br>  I don't think you should worry about it. If it becomes awkward, just try to focus on the work. Also remember that he has probably been in this situation before; it is nothing new to him. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps <3|`|icEPhnvtaa	dude dont be obvious . and just forget about it and soon enough ur frend will forget . why cant all teachers be mean wrinkly old ladies who have to take three naps a dy and smell like tuna and cat . but it is ok . i totally know how u feel . make ur frend suare not to tell . if u  cant suare then make her ankle promise . or pinkie promise . and . to get over it find a bf . hope i help .  just dont tal about it and dont look at him . i really hope i help .|`|3Y1rL5Vfaa	even if your friend tells him...<br>  <br>  he wont say anything to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  so what if u like an oler man...<br>  <br>  your more mature.<br>  <br>  </3|`|wv4rOWqZaa	Teach him... :)<br>  <br>  Srsly - Idk...find another crush???
usj1lyfFaa	So you are expecting him to do something you can't?  How does that sound even remotely fair to you?  Believe me, guys get just as shy, scared, and nervous as girls do.<br>  <br>  There are things you can do to make it easier for him though.|`|jA2VJXzFaa	Girls, why don't you tell us you like us?|`|OgkGsCkvaa	Because, one of the biggest fears for guys is rejection...... my opinion.|`|wv4rOWqZaa	Well...here is why :): Because recently I think I like one girl, BUT I am more convinced that I like another girl...which on her turn is, OK a real whore - but I do have other reasons to like her(the second girl). So...I can't tell the firs one, like...: <br>  <br>  "I like you but I like another girl better...and she was a hooker for some time - by the way".<br>  <br>  Now you see why...well...|`|GYij4N13aa	We could ask you girls the same thing, lol. Our minds get questions like "what if she finds a flaw in me?" or "what if she doesn't like me?" or "What is she rejects me?"|`|stHol8ITaa	Because we're human too.

6a8Ydw5Zaa	DONT MAKE a move let her|`|N0cmhQYJaa	what are you 12|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	You can't take advantage of the willing.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	She is wanting you to feel her up.Not saying this to sound mean or nasty, but were she a decent girl she would have said "You better not" when you said "think that wills top me?"|`|KHjYq2bHaa	You should talk to her and tell her how you feel. Nothing will change if it is kept to yourself.|`|icEPhnvtaa	dont do it . and she doesnt know what she wants . respect her . show her what you wrote on here .|`|XWHWbVxEaa	Girlfriends?<br>  so your saying you have more than one?|`|lC28wczQaa	You don't want to move too fast...and you don't want to wait for her to make the first move, she may not be that kind of girl.<br>  <br>  Just let it happen. If YOU think you are taking advantage of her, then you are probably right. And of course this depends on the age of both of you. The best thing to do is talk to her about what she feels is comfortable and appropriate behavior, you know?|`|IW592N5Zaa	tell her that you respect her and care about her so much that you wouldn't want to do anything to make her uncomfortable or make her get the wrong ideas about you. tell her what you wrote here, your feelings and the truth. she'll really like that you can be honest and keep your guy side back for her|`|m1r1PnJfaa	lol she doesn't even know what she really wants she wants to show you but she doesn't want to get hurt just leave it alone|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Wait for her to ask you to do something and if she doesn't care then it shouldn't matter|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	just tell her you care  and u won`t hurt her  show her that u are not take average of her|`|CSyBGcLYaa	i haven't got a clue what you're talking about.|`|KVHuHYIFaa	babycakes, i think you can go up her shirt after 4 or 5 months. most people have sex by this time in their relationship.
NUciANHQaa	Hey let me just start by saying i know what your going through, the dreaded friend zone! it sucks and its almost impossible to get out of but if you are sure you really care for her don't give up. Pursue her, work hard, make her happy and be funny but no matter what you do make sure you don't fall deeper into the deadly friend zone. Also flirt with other girls so she gets a little jealous because it may sound weird but jealousy is one of the  main attractions to women because if they think you like someone else they wonder why you don't like them and in return start to like you. So keep you her head up high, show confidence but dont be a prick either. And soon enough she will sart to change her feelings for you. <br>  Good Luck!
MpNCNQU5aa	sorry i dont think so....<br>  not enough info anyways<br>  wat was his body doing wen u were talking wit him|`|06Z3fh4laa	From this perspective, it's way to vague to tell.|`|b5kw4znQaa	no he just randomly walked up to a stranger that he wanted nothing to do with|`|I4tulYTzaa	Enough to talk to you. And maybe more if you let him. Its my opinion if you like someone to let them know. So even if they didn't before now they have the seed planted in there heads that its a possibility. And maybe in the future he will.|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	I'm sure he was just being friendly and trying to start a conversation.  We won't know if he likes you or not just by bringing up "art"|`|lC1VVt96aa	He is obviously wanting to become acquainted with you.  It is very desirable to have a wide circle of friends so welcome his friendship and don't expect anything more than a friend.|`|juczLKDEaa	Right now he's just interested. Flirt a little.

And I think is possible that he could like you since he got up the nerve to speak to you in the first place.|`|pE9mDI95aa	he likes you he jus dont want to show or admit it

AA10719818	I live in Myrtle Beach.<br>  <br>  There is nothing to do right now, its the off season.<br>  <br>  You won't be able to get into any clubs.<br>  <br>  Its too cold to walk on the beach at night.<br>  <br>  You will get picked up by cops if they catch you out.<br>  <br>  So yea, just have fun durin gthe day-shop, go see a show, and spare your parents the frustration of a cop bringing you to the door in the middle of the night.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|dhTMwvDvaa	omg! i live in myrtle beach....im 14.....lol.<br>  anyway.......to make it fun......u could get a fake I.D. and go to Club Kryptonite.....it's cool (my friend did that). Or, go skinny dipping in the ocean....lol i did that once...... or, you could find a party to crash...? <br>  or go to the house of blues and see some cool band play? that's pretty fun. how long will you be down here? you could sneak and see fireworks on theubeach, that's pretty fun. or you and her could come hang out with me and we'd all do something fun......i sneak out a lot too lol. idk......you could do a lot of different things......<br>  hmm......idk<br>  e-mail me: cameronzangel16@yahoo.com<br>  or myspace: www.myspace.com/justinzangel50<br>  <br>  lol im sure i can think of a lot of ideas if i get to thinking lol =]
QSfHObZpaa	I think you just sound mad paranoid.. YOu've only been with him 2 weeks, so you don't love him and he doesn't love you yet..<br>  <br>  It's only been 2days..  If he hadn't answered your texts or calls I could understand, but where it's just he hasn't been on msn in 2days..  Maybe he just doesn't spend all his nights on msn.|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	Hmm... well, that is a long time, but it could be a due to a few things... is he busy at work/school?  Does he hold a job that makes him busy?  Also, how long did you guys date before making it official?  Honestly I would call/ text after three days, but if you guys are "dating" that is, boyfriend/girlfriend, more than three days would be a bit excessive.  Just wait it out, and don't panic!

It's only been 2 weeks, he's not going to love you that fast.  Anybody that says they love you that soon, you need to be cautious about them.  It could also just be a coincidence that he isn't online when you are.  Just don't worry, you may push him away if you feel that strongly about him that fast.  Take it slowly.|`|h7vlGZKhaa	He cant be avoiding u cause how would he kno if u were online or not?<br>  He might be grounded or busy. U shoud try calling him.|`|zyPfWLpOaa	IF HE HAS ANOTHER GIRL.... THEN KILL HER|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	yup|`|Nqda6ulSaa	well after two weeks he wouldnt love you that that much maybe he is busy.idk call him
AA11479805	Move on, honestly don't waste your time over someone that doesnt care about you. There is so much more to life, and there are more people you will meet in the future and everything. I suggest you forget him the proper way, ignore him and live your life happily. Always keep a smile and act like you dont know this person, remove his number anyway of contact, and dont mention him to yourself or others anymore.|`|RVf7ctjXaa	mhgc|`|6hVKDNEzaa	So funny because I just ditched my best friend today too - we were friends for years but sometimes enough is enough.<br>  <br>  I won't lie it's taken about a year and a half to give her the shove. You need to think long and hard about the pros and cons of the relationship for example who puts more effort into the relationship? You or him?<br>  <br>  Another thing you need to do is take some time to yourself. It may be a week it may be a month without any contact with this person. See if you miss them....or feel as if a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.<br>  <br>  As a previous depression sufferer, you need some time to yourself. Don't rely on other people apart from your close family, people you consider real friends, and health care professionals.<br>  <br>  I've found that the day you can laugh about the situation you are/were in is the day you have moved on.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps - this is all from my own experience! :)|`|qMnuRO50aa	I think the key to getting over someone is to focus on their flaws. They must have some flaws, everyone does. Then amplify the flaws in your mind until they begin to stand out almost obscenely. Be like "he doesn't truly care for my feelings, he's nothing but a womanizer" (even if it's not entirely true). After that, whenever you think of the person, you will then recall that one flaw and realize that they really aren't that great.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this method is a little harsh, but it works.|`|PeU6sig6aa	you should talk to him about it before u ditch hiim as a friend.  maybe he was uncomfortable telling u he has  has a gf,  or he needs timeor somthing...theres lots of answers and u should always talk before taking action.
Yz981zO6aa	Most brides start looking right away. I did. It's fun to be the bride and you only get to shop for your first wedding gown once!!  And, if you are going to special-order your gown, you do need to allow plenty of time for it to be made and shipped and fitted, once it arrives. Your friend, who is being married in June, still has time to find a gown, but the time to get one ordered is getting very short. However, there are so many options now for purchasing off-the-rack, that she should not have a problem. Go and see your friend and have a wonderful time helping her find her gown. It sounds as though she needs you! And..happy wedding to you both!!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I got engaged in February, and bought my dress the beginning of March.  They had the size I needed at the store, so I didn't have to wait for it to come in.  It takes a few months to come in, so she definitely should already have it.  She needs to get looking!!|`|P3e2kJtwaa	I've looked at dresses since I was a little girl.  I've always been a silly daydreaming romantic like that.<br>  But I started seriously looking when my (now hubby) and I decided we were serious Got married by justice of the peace in October, bought the dress in October, and we're having our wedding ceremony in June.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	It usually takes months for them to get it in and then mroe time to alter it if they need to. She needs to start asap! My dress from david's bridal only took about a month and a half to get in, but i know some can take up to 7 months.|`|G1boIrFuaa	Yeah, she should definitely start looking!  Once she finds it she's still have to have it ordered, plus consider time for alterations!!|`|4lL34wJnaa	I started looking a couple weeks after getting engaged.  My dress was ordered at the end of September, I still have not gotten it yet!  Thank goodness my wedding is not until July!|`|LCAzlHhEaa	We got engaged toward the end of June and by the first week in August I had my dress picked out.  But we had less than a year to plan our wedding|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Most dresses take 6-8 months to come in. I started looking when I was a year from the wedding and ordered it when I was 7 months out. You don't want to start looking too soon in case your weight changes or you find something else that you love even more.<br>  I find it odd that she hasn't looked yet. She'll have to buy off the rack being her wedding is so soon.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	It usually takes about six months for your wedding dress to come in after it is ordered. She better move fast or buy a dress off of the rack. Did you ask the sales lady were you picked your dress out how long before it is discontinued ? If that dress has been out for some time it may get discontinued before you have a chance to order it. A year in advance is the norm.|`|7WbehQZjaa	I was engaged July of 2008, we picked our day in July of 2010, and I ordered my dress in October of 2008. I was going to wait but my MOH was excited and we decided to go looking. Most dresses do take 6-8 months to come in, so it is odd that she hasn't started looking. She may not be able to afford it, or maybe she is just a little sad that no one has been able to go with her. Take her out and help her. She just may need a little encouragement.<br>  <br>  Congratulations to you both!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I was engaged mid Jan of this year, started looking end of Jan, ordered my dress 1st week in February so it can be in on time. I'm getting married this June. It'll take 3 1/2 months for the dress to be ordered and then have time for alterations if needed. I'll have it by end of April.|`|2rCZbaEIaa	my wedding is 13 months away<br>  im going to start looking at dresses in 1-2 months,  but won't probably put any money towards one until at least September
K4MuUaqiaa	There's nothing wrong with that.<br>  However, make sure to explain to him that the ONLY reason you did that is because you had to get up early for work, and you couldn't sleep through his snoring.<br>  <br>  His ego needs encouragement from you, as he likely thinks that you are turning away from him in your relationship.<br>  Laugh all you want, that's how we act. We get upset, we act mad.|`|mehbohrMaa	of course not! If you can't sleep you can't sleep. Tell you what, sleep in the same room with him under one condition. Until he gets over this cold and stops snoring, put a sound that is equally annoying to him in the room, or record his snoring and play it for him to hear. Maybe then he'll understand.<br>  <br>  Btw, I hate the sound of snoring too. My sister does it alot!|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Did you explain to him that the only reason you slept in the other room was due to the snoring? You will retrun to bed after his sinuses clear up, so everything shoudl be ok, right?|`|rlQOjyhbaa	no u want apologize an explain an tell him no offense an if he continues to snore attempt to cure the problem of it instead of moving to another room also role him over in his sleep he will stop snoring sometimes|`|fLLysVK6aa	no not at all. you need your sleep. but i think that you should explain thie situtation to him, he might think that you just dont want to sleep with him.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Why suffer your self to have a rustles sleep because some one is causing you discomfort in your sleep. No nothing wrong with wanting to get a good sleep.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Its fine. Just tell him he was snoring and you couldn't sleep.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You're not in the wrong. He's being a big baby. Talk to him patiently and explain that you need your sleep.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	I totally understand. I've done that a couple times myself. But as long as you don't do it everynight and your sex life is still good, then that's just fine!|`|mCM363I9aa	no but there are remedies for snoring you know.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	No it was not wrong of you to do that. Just explain to him that you love him and want to sleep in the same bed but you needed to get some sleep for work. Let him know that it is really bothering you right now due to the cold and that you are trying your hardest to get sleep but can't. If it is a cold you should be back in the room in a few days. Go to bed with him and put him to ed then slip out and go to the guest room but let him know that you are going to try to stay there for the night. If you can't you will still be in the house that you are not running of any where.|`|ehAG30Yvaa	If you have to get up for work and your husband is keeping you from sleeping it's definitely ok to go sleep somewhere else. I can understand why he might be a little frustrated that you left him but as long as it's not an everyday occurrence and he knows why you did it, he'll get over it. <br>  <br>  My husband was sick with the flu this weekend and I just about killed him because he wouldn't stop moaning and groaning and shivering in the middle of the night. Instead of killing him I went and slept on the couch and was able to get some sleep. I've never done that but he was fine with it and appreciated me not beating him to death while he was miserable already. Men are such babies when they are sick...my husband is worse than our 2 kids!|`|t81MEJ82aa	No you weren't, and I don't even understand why this is even causing any type of confusion or debate. It sounds like he is being a baby about it. He'll be ok.
EBnofxgpaa	Tell her all the great things that will happen there.<br>  Even if it's an exaggeration.<br>  Or put her on a guilt trip and tell her you aren't going because you won't go by yourself, yadda yadda yadaa.|`|JPkgKCNtaa	ya just ask someone else. no one should have to do anything that they dont want to do. If you didnt want to do something would you like it if your friend was convincing you?|`|XaBR0Scyaa	idk|`|Xu4x19y6aa	Ask someone else!  She should be glad you asked her, not like "oh convince me!".  That's childish.|`|6D8BI1ffaa	Ask another friend who might be more enthusiastic about going to country jam with you.  After all, you shouldn't have to make a presentation to your friend about it.  Either she wants to go or she doesn't.  You shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get her to say yes.  Is she that important in your life?  Evidently, she doesn't care much about your friendship.  Forget her and ask someone else.

At 45 years old I spent some time with an 18 year old stunning German beauty. What was strange though, was how many of her friends tried chatting me up behind her back.<br>  I don't cheat, so that's what I mean by embarrassing.<br>  <br>  After so long away I have lost any dialect I may have had in England.<br>  I also speak quite slowly and deliberately, being careful with my choice of words. With many people I still speak English and have learned to make myself easily understood.<br>  During the World Cup here in Germany a few years ago, a couple of young English girls told me I had an incredibly sexy voice and accent.<br>  And when I started speaking fluent German to some guy they went wild. Quite a party that ended up (Yes, with both of them at my place, just in case you're going to ask).<br>  <br>  So what are you still doing in England ?<br>  Just read the answers son.|`|qoaivLfpaa	I personally think British, Australian and southern accents are hot!

vOomJtbsaa	I had a coordinator, my wedding is in a week and a half and thank God for him!  He's been amaazzinnngg!  He cost us roughly around 1500 dollars and boy was he worth it.  He took care of most everything, I gave him internet links and pictures and he went and did alot of the foot work for us.  With my fiance working out of town all the time and me trying to hold down a part time job and care for our 5 month old son it was just so much easier to not have to shop around for the best price on flowers, linens, cakes, bartenders, etc etc etc.  He took care of the majority of stuff for us.  About all I had to do was go in for tastings and fittings.  I think if you have the extra to spend, it's well worth it.<br>  **** The money we saved from his help shopping around on flower costs, food costs, etc.... is what we actually payed him with.  So he didn't cost us any extra, we would've spent that money on more expensive vendors because we literally didn't have the time to shop around.|`|AA11380378	I had a wedding coordinator and it saved my sanity. They know what to do and where people go, they pay the vendors, they take care of your gifts, they keep track of the things you leave behing. I highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  I  did a lot of research and did most of the stuff on my own, but my wedding coordinator was awesome and I'm so gratfeul taht she was there a long the way,<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|mhvb9eFkaa	In 1977 there was no such thing!  My wife's mother and my mom got together and worked with my wife to arrange the whole thing.<br>  There were over 400 at our wedding and reception and everything went fantastically well.<br>  Sounds like you have enough time to take care of things on your own.  Any way of involving his mom?  I know my mom was ecstatic when my wife asked her to help her mom!<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Good Luck!|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Lord no.  Big waste of money.  Do it yourself, keep it simple and cheap, and use the money you save to invest for your future.|`|05593376462c02bf5256a43823fbd06daa	First get the Church and reception place reserved. Look through a Bridal magazine and check out necklines, lace, style etc. When you think you know about what you want in a bridal gown, go and start looking and trying on several different styles. Remember it will take at least 3-4 months to order your gown and get it back into the shop. When you decide on your gown, then we go to the bridesmaids and maid of honor, flower girl, ring-bearer(if wanted) tuxedos and then your Mother and then the groom's Mother. The Mothers should be color co-ordinated with your color scheme. Get your invitations done about 3-4 months prior to wedding and send out about 6 weeks before the wedding. Now in between all that, after your Church and Reception place, the photographer comes next, music, food, decorations, flowers and all the other little odds and ends. There are more things involved but I think  you have enough to get started with right now.|`|bQCfOftxaa	Didn't use a wedding planner - did everything myself and with the help of some very lovely friends and family members!  I'm getting married in less than 6 weeks, and only had about a four month engagement.  Once I kinda figured out what kind of wedding I wanted (size, colours, etc.) it was easier for me to ask for help.  The people around you are probably very willing to help you - I would say ask them!!  :)<br>  Good luck and happy planning!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	My wedding planner was me myself and I. My friend that was married before gave me some tips, but that was about it. I looked at wedding books and found the things I wanted and the place I wanted off the internet and a local wedding planning book I got at a jewelry store in the mall for free.|`|sCDiWPq4aa	I did have a wedding planner and thank god for her and him. Yes, I could of done it myself but I was under enough stress..it was easier to pay someone else.|`|VqilAWDGaa	No, I had friends to guide me through what all I would need, and everybody helped me look for bargains.|`|AA11526089	We didn't use a professional wedding coordinator because we couldn't afford one, I called around and because our wedding budget was so little no one wanted to work with us, so we found ourselves on our own, at first we were going to get married in Vegas, I picked out the chapel and everything but I just didn't want to get married in Vegas, no harm intended but to me getting married is Vegas is "cheap"; this is just my humble opinion and by no means do I intend to insult anyone but that's just how I feel, I will admit tho' the chapel and grounds were very very beautiful, my only concern was all my family and friends and his as well would not be able to make it, the flight and hotel and extracurricular monies are hard to come by in this economy. Anyway so I finally convinced him to have the wedding here in San Francisco, at a local community hall, the entire ceremony and reception was in the same hall. A very good friend of mines stepped in and offered to help us with our wedding planning, her only experience was helping her daughter with her wedding reception several years ago [her daughter eloped to Reno, Nevada] ~ anyway my husband and I did all the foot work for the decorations and linens and glass wear and DJ and food, we paid for "everything" except the food and the cake, luckily my mom paid for all that [thanks mom!] ~ we got married on a strict budget that ballooned a bit, but everything turned out wonderful ~ we went to the dollar tree and stocked up on glass ware and glass salt and pepper shakers  and imitation flowers for the centerpieces ~ we went to Lowe's and brought two dozen square cut mirrors to add to the centerpieces ~ I utilized ebay a great deal from the purple and white candles for the centerpieces to the crystal bell that my great-niece rang to announce my arrival  to custom wedding cameras for each table ~ I also ordered beautiful [blank inside] wedding programs, my husband is a computer genius so we cut a lot of cost by doing our own wedding invitations and announcements and programs ~ we ordered our wedding invitations from www.orientaltrading.com as a matter of fact we ordered quite abit of things from them they have a whole catalog that they will send to you with nothing but wedding related stuff in it, its great! and inexpensive ~ basically my husband and I did everything ourselves [and without a car]; my friend helped us with wine and champagne suggestions which worked out great, we purchased the wine from our local grocery store [shhhhh! it was only $2.00 a bottle]; we brought 40 bottles of white and red wine, no one seemed to mind that it was a cheap wine [remember were on a budget]; we did however purchase an expensive champagne but luckily we got it whole sale because my husband works in a liquor store ~ my friend really did her thing on the actual day she was the wedding coordinator every bride dreams of, she had the staff of people that she and I gathered together [family and friends to help serve food]; and just took charge, and my wedding day [October 11, 2008] was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! we couldnt have asked for anything better, I watched bridezilla and bride on a budget [I think that's the name of it] and all the other shows regarding weddings when I was planning mines and I learned alot and got a alot of great ideas ~ so that is my suggestion to you, get your girlfriends together and get everyone's input [but remember its your and ultimately its what you and your future husband want]; but I find if you engage others for their ideas you can find somethings you may have overlooked etc. etc. ~ its not an easy task planning a wedding especially when your the bride but other than someone that is well off who in this day and time and economy can afford a wedding coordinator ~ take a deep breath and jump in with both feet, I'm no expert but if you need any help at all I am more than willing to provide you with that help just contact me at cranberry_juice33@yahoo.com {Tricia] ~ I'm sorry my answer is so long I hope I was some help to you. <br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	No I didn't.  I wanted to plan everything myself so I checked out books, magazines, and websites for all the tips and advice I could find.  I did ask my sister-in-law and my aunt to be on-site coordinators the day of the wedding since I couldn't do that myself.  There's no art to planning a wedding.  You do what makes you and your groom happy.  It doesn't have to fit into any wedding mold.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes. I was the coordinator at several weddings in the past for family members and it was extremely stressful. I was not allowed to enjoy myself as a guest at all. I do not intend to do that to any of our guests. So it's worth it to me to pay a few hundred dollars to have that peace of mind that our guests won't have to work at our wedding and can enjoy themselves as they should.
ef9bde338c53689b9b1568a4a538cb08aa	You are not the one that is committed by marriage so in any case, she would be the one who is morally wrong.|`|hagHy93paa	yes if your not married to her|`|Cpwedckvaa	NOT AS LONG AS YOU ARE HER HUSBAND!|`|2bhMmlzHaa	No i don't her husband should have took care of business|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	yeah|`|N8EB7YkMaa	yes, it is considered morally wrong by most people.  but no one here has walked a mile in her shoes or yours.  none of us know the situation and i don't think without knowing the "what's or whys" can we answer that question honestly.|`|USooqQlWaa	Depends on her situation.  Some people live polyamorous lives and have several relationships.  Is it morally wrong?...that depends on who you're asking (and who answers) - we all have different moral standards.|`|W7uP1ty4aa	You`d better watch for her husband`s post asking if it`s morally acceptable to beat your a$$ for messing with his marriage. You`re one dumb fool.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	It is morally wrong for a married women to date, someone other than her husband.|`|Xv7CREwpaa	Well she could be the love of your life ... and I wouldn't personally walk away from something that could be amazing.<br>  <br>  So No ..|`|ZEitfScGaa	Yes. Do you know what I would do to the man if I ever caught my wife cheating? You don't want to find out.|`|FgHq93suaa	Yes... Don't get yourself into that... It's a bad trap... The husband will come after you... and if there are kids... speed away even faster!|`|wqCznap2aa	If her husband doesn't abuse her and he's good to her yes, that's messed up.|`|vk3dKR3Caa	YES how would you feel if you was married and some guy was with your wife. Yes it is wrong.|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	Only if you're married, too.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Why would it be morally wrong to date your own wife?|`|I0G21lPBaa	if your not her husbanddd aaaaaaaa yyeeeeeees!!|`|Tk51uq33aa	If she is married, then she made a vow, signed a contract, and had a huge celebration to legally commit herself to one man.<br>  <br>  If she is thinking about dating you (or any other man that isn't her husband) she needs to take care of her legal obligations to her husband before dating anyone.<br>  <br>  She is morally wrong if she dates someone else, and the 'other guy' is morally wrong for thinking it's ok.<br>  <br>  There IS a moral way to deal with the situation.  It involves a divorce or separation.  She should take the initiative to do what is right, and the guy should only encourage her to be honest with her husband.|`|ZcFtxODSaa	no matter if she's living with him or not whos to say she won't go back to him if you want to date her you should wait until their legally seperated. just out of repect.|`|19ea0ffe56f1755c71f275c227e7fe16aa	why don't you justify why it's ok to date a married woman.  would like to hear your point of view instead....|`|zotSt8MDaa	She took the vows, not you. So i think your good.

Etc.  That's assuming you're not just relying on the word of the cheater.<br>  <br>  Still ...<br>  <br>  Even *if* it's morally okay, it's usually a dumb idea.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	It's wrong that your cheating with her. Imagine if you where married and instead of your wife telling you her problems she just went out and cheated on you. It would suck huh.  Now Idk what the situation is in this case but I would want it to be i the open either way. Tell her if she wants to be with you she needs to leave him. If she doesn't want to or if its not that serious then why are you doing this with her would be my question ?  I'm not saying its moral or not but you know whats the right thing in your heart, if you fail to act on that thought Karma will catch up with you at some point. It won't be pretty either. Good Luck|`|WbKBHh8Haa	well, there are exceptions to this.<br>  <br>  If she is married only in paper, as I am, due to $$$, then it is ok.  The marriage is over, even in the eyes of god as far as i am concerned, and zi don't just say this for my benefit.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	Yes!<br>   No one should go that way dating some one who is married.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Yes.  You better watch out that her husband doesn't kick your a$$!!|`|jvvTybx4aa	yes, shes married!!!|`|mCM363I9aa	if your not the one married to her, of course.|`|6gPCA7jHaa	You would not be the one in the wrong, she would. I had a long conversation about this with someone not too long ago. She was the one that took those vows, not you, she is the one breaking those vows, not you. Exactly how does that make you wrong??? Now, if her husband was your friend then he!! yeah you are wrong.|`|1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	You ask  "Do youfeel that it is "morally" wrong to date a married woman?<br>  <br>  You knew the answer before you ask, but to get the points I will answer!<br>  <br>  Who is this woman married to, YOU? If so then I encourage you to always date your wife.<br>  <br>  IF SHE IS THE WIFE OF ANOTHER MAN, I URGE YOU TO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You had the answer before you ask!|`|dV50jErjaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArT2P.328qoQyqI8s.BGaA3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309144622AAt8Lhx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  Yes therefore you should stop cheating or else you will pay!|`|an1EMiFkaa	Depends on the situation.

h3rN7snkaa	Try going to the shriners, charities, social workers, go above and beyond. She needs to push, and people arn't going to care; so she needs to keep pushing. Look for non-profit lawyers, talk to services that help abused children, situations like that. <br>  God Bless.|`|yFBKkcqLaa	The child will have all the rights in the world. He is the spoken voice and should be able to recieve legal aid. It makes me so sick to hear about these things but unfortuneatly they are out there everyday. Im afraid to say that unless the child goes to the police and your friend cant apply for legal aid then there isnt really alot that either of you can do. Tell the child that they havent done anything wrong but the only way he can stop going to the fathers is to go the police<br>  Sorry for the child and the mother|`|KV66KhVRaa	take the child to a counselor to see if they can get the child to talk more about the abuse enough that others will take it seriously|`|YYdtd47baa	Use the answer below mine. Do everything she said... all true. I'm sorry about the abuse. Hope all goes well.<br>  Izy|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	I agree with sleeping among the flowers, she needs to go every route possible to get help. I just hate to hear stories of children that are seemingly left to be abused, while some are taken from their homes for stupid reasons. You would think at his age of 10, that he would have some credibility. just because there are no obvious signs of abuse doesn't mean there wasn't touching or other. Trouble is, once the courts allow the father to continue seeing the boy and all eyes are off him, he may take the abuse further..and that just should never happen. I feel so bad for the little guy and the Mom. It must be horrible to feel defenceless when it comes to the safety of your child. however, she doesn't have to take that crap. make some heads roll, step on toes or beg for someone to listen. Good luck guys, and comfort the boy and let him know that you guys will do everything you can.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	DON'T advise her to move..if she has this court order that the dad get him every weekend and she leaves with the boy without permission, she will go to jail and then he will have him ALL THE TIME and she may lose custody for being a flight risk and for kidnapping.tell her to go to legal aid, it may be free<br>  and fast
s92cftVAaa	if she is still under the shock of the break up it will be very difficult that you rationalise...how good friends you are? could you ask her as a personal favour to stop for a weekend? maybe that will give her time to react ( i do not think she has let herself react to what happened). try to make her understand that it is very important for you. maybe her love for you will be strong to convince her...tell her about how worry you are...<br>  hope it helps!|`|1TSMdgG1aa	Well......telling us is kinda like telling the world....<br>  <br>  I think she's acting like this because she doesn't want to deal with the feelings of heartbreak that come with a breakup.  She probably thinks that she can have them and leave them, like guys do.  But in the end she's only hurting herself.  <br>  <br>  This is a dangerous situation for all involved, because she is exposing herself to all sorts of diseases and is also exposing her partners.  Be firm with her and ask her to wear condoms when she's with someone.  <br>  <br>  Simply tell her that if she needs to cry it out and vent and scream or whatever in order to start getting the pain out of her system.....to just do it.  And that you're there for her.  That she needs to start loving herself and respecting herself so that someday when the time comes she can be ready for another relationship.
mdV0oXATaa	Love is everywhere. If you just happen to find it on the internet, what does it matter, it is still Love?|`|U4V6TkZEaa	I've met a couple of people that way, but most of the people on-line are people that you wouldn't date anyway, and the few that worth dating are usually either fake profiles designed to entice you to sign up, or they get so many e-mails that they don't have time to read them all.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	I think they need to just get away from their house and go out and meet real people. I can't imagine having a boyfriend that I've never even met and can't hug or kiss. You may fall for someone online for the things they say, but I'm sorry, you can't know that they are being exclusive with you.|`|farAMKNpaa	I'm sure con men and desperate old people love them.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Abunch of ****, are you going to report me too?|`|jjoBO3jkaa	They are overrated. Get out there, do what you love, whether it be golf, fishing, or what have you... who knows? You might stumble upon mr./ms. right. So much better to meet in person. more personal. Presence and comfort around them in PERSON says a lot about chemistry.|`|T7uUZvA3aa	DON'T DO IT (I HAD A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE) TRUST ME! ALL OF THEM ON THE COMP. DATING SITES ARE SICK|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	I think they fine if you are into meeting people that way. I've always been dating local girls and never considered trying any of them for a date. I<br>  have met people on line through different forms, but that is for common interesrs, they are all ages and sex which doesn't matter. You wouldn't look for a date there though.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|uhRKCb9kaa	well you can start tying this i am online "coolguy_198km@yahoo.com"<br>   experiance is every thing so get your own experiance|`|aKvxy3xBaa	I think it's a very good idea. That is if you email back and forth, then talk on the phone a few times, then MEET for coffee in public to see if there's a need for the 2nd date. I think you find more out of the person on line, than meeting in a bar and a girl/guy asking you out.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Personally, I would never use one. It would take away the whole thrill of the hunt, as it were. But, a lot of people apparently use them. The sites wouldn't still be around if they didn't help some people. It's really your judgment call. Sorry I can't be more help.

I wouldn't have high expectations, though.  A lot of guys on there aren't serious.|`|h9fKoHGyaa	To me, I think it's for people who don't know how to interact in real life. It seems pathetic, but if people find true love, then good for them!|`|xNhNRJrBaa	Dangerous, weird, some freak online could track you down an pretend they are someone else then plan to meet you and hurt you.|`|dHPA390Qaa	I think that it is a great thing!  However, you should only look for singles that are accessible, not those that live too far away to make dating possible.  <br>  Look at it this way- You can walk into a club and look around the room and wonder- What guys are available, emotionally and physically?<br>                     What guys share similar interest?<br>                    What guys share my standards of living?<br>                     What guys have goals for themselves?<br>  The dating services can cut through all that and speed you along to find the guys in your area that share your intentions. (your intent is to date or to find friends, etc)<br>  You must however be careful, as men will lie to make themselves seem better.  So don't believe everything they tell you!|`|tZES73R0aa	I think that it's dangerous|`|HipCpcIlaa	i hate myself and i want to die, i hate them|`|JquoBRKJaa	dating sites could be fun. i have no expierience with it, but for everyone on here telling you its for desperate people.

I've had a that happen to me a few times. One comment I would like to make in your situation though, you say you used to always phone her. Maybe she has 'ditched' you because you stopped calling. It is possible that she was used to you always calling her, and when you stopped she began presuming that you were no longer interested in being friends with her, and hence why she has not called.<br>  <br>  If you really want to remain friends with her call her up, have a chat, and end the call by asking her to call you sometime. If she doesn't call, then you know the friendship is dead. If she does, well take it from there. But don't get into the habit of you always being the one that calls.

Harsh but he'll get over it.<br>  <br>  But c'mon, you said he lied about how many times he was married so I'm sure he's used to people saying those words to him.|`|6gPCA7jHaa	Yes, end it. You don't want to keep dragging him through the mud because you have some healing to do. It is the right thing to do.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	If you can't "get over it" then there is no moving on. Tell him and if he cries oh well he'll get over it in time as will you.|`|G50ucmllaa	Just do it...let him cry.  Personally he sounds more manipulating than anything.|`|knXnjnSmaa	Who cares about his tears, sorry but sometimes guys know how to manipulate and try to make you feel bad. He started the relationship wrong by lying and being dishonest, he knew you would care or he would have told the truth. Too many bad signs too early on, I say end things and start fresh with someone else. Good luck.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Eeeek! You have a parasite on your hands.  He just lost his job and he's pushing to move in with you??????   He isn't listening to you????? Eeeeeeeek! He lied to you? If he was a total jerk would this be easier? Trust yourself, you're on the right track.|`|froaQcUgaa	I think you need to be completely honest with this guy and let him down easy. If you dont feel comfortable with the relationship you should put a stop to it sooner than later. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU|`|XmI8wNaCaa	You pretty much answer your own question by saying you are thinking about alot. You need to move on. You do not trust him and trust me those feeling do not go away|`|2bhMmlzHaa	Best way to say i don't love you date other men in front of him|`|N8EB7YkMaa	I am having a DeJa Vu here.  He is pushing this too hard and then cries.  This creeps me out.  I think you should really pay attention to the red flags you are getting.  I really think they are "red flags"  I think he is depending on you not to hurt him.  I think inside he knows that you don't want to hurt him and he is taking advantage of it.  Let him cry, it's ok, but honestly, don't move in with or marry this guy.|`|S8RL9lieaa	He's setting alarm bells off in you and you don't need anyone to tell you, as you already know what to do. Keep him at arms length for the time being and if you're still not certain call it a day.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Since he's not listening to you, I think the only way to get through to him is with silence.  Stop answering his calls, don't ream emails / texts.  Just let him fade out.<br>  <br>  You may also want to invite company over for a while, or hang out with friends, so you won't be alone when he comes knocking desperately at your door.<br>  <br>  Normally I wouldn't suggest ending it this way, but words won't work when he won't listen.|`|b2991299e50178a6760fb54b34c39b27aa	There's only one way.  Say, "I don't feel the same way you do.  I am moving on.  It what is best for me and, I believe, for you too.  I am sorry that you are feeling hurt.  Please don't call me anymore."<br>  <br>  That's it.  Clarity is better than BS.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Be gentle, but be firm. Tell him the spark just isn't there for you, and he has to let you go and move on.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a control freak, to me. I think you're dodging a bullet with this one!|`|KcHhLsCAaa	There is no easy way.  "Beat it loser" is not a good way.  A prolonged explanation is not necessary either.  Jsut tell him that you do not feel that same way he does and let it go at that.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	That's never an easy thing to say to someone.<br>  <br>  But be completely honest and tell him your not sure if your happy right now and need to take some time for yourself and find out whats right for you.

UG2z5rGIaa	sounds like he is just scared of getting hurt.<br>  think about it from his point of view<br>  <br>  your on a "break" with your current bf. but you guys arent officially broken up.<br>  <br>  so he must be scared that if he likes you and you decide to get back with your bf, he'll be hurt and feel bad etc.<br>  <br>  so if you really like him and are ready for him then brkup officially with current bf. and tell the guy u like now that u guys have and see what happens<br>  <br>  and btw some guys are just really bad with girls so they act like that|`|beXsfnJBaa	Yeah I agree. I think he is just unsure of whether to pursue you or not since you aren't officially broken up with your bf. He might think you are just messing around with him or something.|`|liid9ZTqaa	confuse|`|XasLRQnXaa	i don't think he knows that you are on break with you're boyfriend so he is trying to take it easy. Sounds like he wants to hang out with you but then was like wtf doesnt she have a boyfriend, hence the "erm, yeah, sure."
65m62rDraa	When anybody gets angry they have a reason to be angry. Sometimes it doesn't make sense to others,because others don't always see things the same way, and of course people are not always exposed to the same situations. What might upset you, might not upset your mom, or vise versa.<br>  Sometimes you can understand a person's reason to be angry by trying to stand in their shoes, while other times all you can do is give her a hug, and show her that you love her even though she is upset.Be there for your mom, and she will be happy. When mom is happy the whole family is happy.|`|3U7WTuXraa	she's probably on her menopause or something. I heard moms get super angry at that stage for no reason.|`|qjf1BoNIaa	Wow, think about what you wrote. That is a lot of pressure for a mom. You can't rely on her to make you happy. I am quite sure she, like everyone right now, is under a tremendous amount of pressure. I know Mom's should be a soft place to land, but this is not a TV sitcom, this is life and Mom's are people too. We are not always happy. We get stressed! Why don't you start thinking about what you can do for her? Why don't you see if you two can start taking evening walks together to burn off the stress of the day? Bake her some cookies. YOU GET WHAT YOU GIVE! The more you invest in your mom's well-being, the more you will get back. You are old enough now to learn it is a two way street.Good luck.|`|oFeNwMheaa	maybe your mum is stessed!
EyaqiWPwaa	she licks your hands...what is she a dog?|`|Lpc2aAzRaa	lick ur hand?  whaaaat?<br>  <br>  <br>  anyways... just talk to her, and be honest but not needy.|`|JqVU84yLaa	your new roommates a dog isn't it your just trying to make it sound like a girl|`|hF6uZqWRaa	uumm she is your roommate not your gf so why are you getting mad?! she never said she wanted to be with you! ... To me it sounds more like a friendship|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Lick your hands???  Anyways...  If you really like her tell her!  That is the only way to know for sure how she feels!|`|dHPA390Qaa	Tell your dad to keep looking.|`|SmOefD5Raa	Never dip your pen in company ink.|`|AA10452323	Your funny...was this some kind of riddle?|`|PAciPpSsaa	I think she's playing games, because she's undecided. <br>  And the whole park thing, Doesn't EVERYBODY get distracted by eye candy?? even if it's not as attractive or is at par with how good looking you are. <br>  Anyways, play games back, be more confident in yourself, Do things that are more important than her distractions. You know what I'm saying? Don't be all crazy for her, make HER want YOU, and then when she wants you really bad, you reward her.|`|rEs4Y5Niaa	Okay I'm in grade 7and well I know that I wouldn't walk around with a guy in the park if he wasn't my boyfriend or if I liked him. I only would if he was my friend otherwise. But she's probably just confused about you and if she likes you or not. She's probably wondering if you like her. <br>  But it's very weird that she LICKED YOUR HANDS!! Like wtf is that? Never heard of that before!!! <br>  Just ask her if she likes you. But only if you realllly think she does, cause then it's going to make things really weird in the house if she says no. So look at the other answers to decide!|`|wZFlmk17aa	If you really feel this way about this girl... why don't you tell her? Now don't go into proposal mode!! Just take a deep breath and be yourself. Besides if she is new to your home, she needs to have enough time to adjust to her new surroundings. I'm saying this from experience as a foster child. Hey don't worry things will work out soon!|`|SKaLskpAaa	Tell her that you like her straight up..Dont be shy..im a girl myself and girls often wait on the boy to ask first.its just the way life is.Girls are scared that you may not like them back, which is why you always get mixed signals from her|`|C7Cz9qqTaa	well if you really like her just tell her how you feel.<br>  whats the worst thing that can happen?<br>  beside she moving out, or telling you she doesnt like you like that or hate you forever.<br>  just tell her.<br>  no pressure.<br>  lmao|`|hec0ChzQaa	I think she is playing with your emotions cause from what i read you go back to her knowing what she does... im sure she knows what she is doing wrong and right. to me she is playing with your emotions.|`|GPAidQs1aa	i say your dad found her on the street as a prost. if you know what i mean  it sounds like she is acting like a total ho|`|DBj8Hj8kaa	Give her some time.

Sorry, but I do the same thing if I don't like a guy. (This may sound bad) but I talk a lot to them, and if they start to like me, I ignore them. I want to just be friends, but most guys don't understand that. I bet you a ton of money she just wants you to be her friend.|`|kTZevQNHaa	I think she likes you as a friend, has a lot on her mind and is not into you romantically--thus--looking at other guys.Giver her some space and treat her more like a sister--as I htink she views you like a brother--from what you write here.|`|urNgcpiBaa	Haha!

wIb3bXTFaa	Dude, she's OPRAH.  Why are you worrying about it?  Talk shows are the bane of human existence.  They are literally the lowest form of entertainment.  People are entertained when they see something that stirs any kind of emotion.  That's why we like movies so much.  But talk shows rely on a different mechanism to produce that emotion.  They exploit people to squeeze as much of it into their 30-minute segment as they can, and they rely mostly on drama and an audience reduced to mob mentality.  The audience's reactions literally influence the way the viewer thinks about what they're seeing.<br>  <br>  That is why I am of the opinion that the only people who subject themselves to this have absolutely nothing to do during the day and are too lazy to actually think about what they're watching.  And Oprah is like the leader of this evil movement.<br>  <br>  Men and women both, can be *****.  I've seen situations where women would beat themselves up to get their husband/bf put in jail, or were abusive mentally and physically to their men.  The thing is, when men beat women, the women usually get hurt a lot worse than vice versa, except in the case where the woman is partial to knives.<br>  <br>  And we all know women are stupid and insane.  They wouldn't have this stereotype if they didn't make it a habit of always going back to the jerkoff who physically and emotionally abuses her, while the Nice Guy stuck in the Friend Zone is beginning to question whether or not there really is any logic to the universe.|`|eWObKmBSaa	I agree with you, she probably is prejudice too.|`|tuXBPrjsaa	i dont agree with oprah about MANY things.|`|N8EB7YkMaa	You are absolutely right, Oprah does paint with too broad of a brush.  I rarely agree with Oprah mostly because I refuse to watch a woman who has never been married discuss marriage and a woman who has never had children, sit there and tell people how to raise them.<br>  I did hear she was abused as a child and she may have valid input there.<br>  No two abused women or men are alike nor are their situations.  It may take leaving once, twice, three or even four times before a person feels strong enough to stay gone.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	Personally, I don't like Oprah. She's become extremely hipicritical.<br>  Spouce abuse goes both ways, more men hit women them the wemon hitting the guys. But I thinks its retaded. I didn't get youre last part thou.|`|klOP21xTaa	Oprah is stinking rich, rich people have their head up they butt.|`|yna24Nbuaa	I think she was generalizing every domestic abuse case is different and in my opinion can not classified in terms of categories. What is true in one case is wrong in another. <br>  <br>  I think people are capable not just men of being abusive.I have seen evil in the form of abuse on both sides of the spectrum. <br>  <br>  We all know there are a variety of reason why people go back to abusive significant others:<br>  <br>  *financial reason <br>  *homeless reason<br>  *for the sake of children<br>  *for family loyalty<br>  *the system does not work for them<br>  *no other options<br>  *lose all sources of income<br>  *societal pressures|`|XQ7Ihe4taa	I think that maybe she doesn't realize that this happens to both genders. Maybe she just assumed. And you know what they say about people who assume. But i totally agree because it happens to everyone and that isn't okay  for anyone...!
N7Yt7kmWaa	I think you should make sure he doesnt know that it bugs you. If your mad enough you can talk to a teacher because thats sexual harrasment, but i have a feeling that you dont really want to tell on him. What i'd suggest doing is just going along with it. It wouldnt be as embarrasing if other people knew it bugged u, or if other people thought it was just some little inside joke. When he says something just be like "ya i know eh?" or something like "dont u wish u had some of this gorgeoussss" It'll stop after a while if it "doesnt bug you".<br>  <br>  GoOd LuCk!~!~!~!|`|0e4wLPhgaa	Tell him: "listen honey, i know by behind is awsome and i am extremly pretty, but you dont have to be saying it all day, no matter how much you like it, ok?"<br>  <br>  that we'll put him on the spot and maybe stop him =)|`|ql9lFzekaa	I would tell the principle or some ne that he is doing that to you or tell him first that you dont like him doing that and if he doesnt listen leave him and try to avoid him as much as possible.|`|1PWsr8X4aa	ignore him...just make pretend he's not even there, he'll get tired of laughing at his own remarks...just try it, it's hard but it works!|`|qRAwBtJ5aa	you have told him to stop and he did, but carried it on. maybe  friend A feels for you? as he can't get your butt out the picture.<br>  you told him to stop and evidently you showed annoyance and yet he still persisted  in making a big deal over it. and to do it in class is stepping over the line, espicially with alot of other students present.<br>  <br>  there are three things you can do. <br>  1) give him an ultimatium, tell him what he is doing is immature and makes you uncomfortable.<br>  2) fight fire with fire and take something small which he says and blow it out of proportion. mimic his voice, annoy him, make fun of him.<br>  3)just ignore him and tell him where to stick it.<br>  <br>  hope it works out for you
8K3IucU3aa	yeah you have to sign your marriage license. but marriage is an oral contract. listen to the vows. one woman sued her husband when they got divorced for breaking a contract and she won.|`|mCM363I9aa	marriage license, unless you also want a prenuptial agreement|`|wI3AAkIoaa	Some people have a pre nep to sign if they are worried about their property or money.

I would take it as you aren't materialistic, or tied down to any certain way of life.  Kinda like a nomad.  If this describes you then it's a compliment.

Vh6qfdOkaa	You need to let this one go. Don't hang out with a guy who does not pay for you! Have some respect for yourself. Anyway, Gujarati boys only do what their mothers tell them for the most part. Most of them are not men enough to stand up for something they want. On the other hand, if you are lucky enough to find one that will stand up for the relationship, they make the best partners. They are just like any other male in the sex department.

I know you've tried and tried, but talk about it with him and don't make it seem like a big deal and say its just a kiss and pressure him. You guys need to talk it over, if your too intimidating than your boyfriend won't kiss you because he's even more nervous and he thinks that he has to try to impress you. BUT TALK!  good luck :D|`|Hk6wIgiOaa	WOW thats a long time, whats wrong with him? How old are you?|`|PG4zLEuXaa	Hi there<br>  Since he is all frozen now, think just for now, just relax and be yourself so it is fun to be with you so he can relax and forget about the kissing.  There's plenty time for that, may be you will have him so relaxed and fun to be with that he start holding your hand and everything will come to those who wait and in good time ... and modern times or not, a kiss, especially your first one, has to come from your boyfriend.  Enjoy !x!|`|nJsTQ6xQaa	Ok i have a qustion how old are you and not in a bad way beleive me in only 12 but since your hi first gf then his is probale going to be nervous, he probale too shy to kiss in public maybe when you guys are along watching a movie or somthing then ask and see, and also if you do kiss him dont have too long of a kiss just a short and sweet one|`|f7W6R9G0aa	Just do it he sounds too nervous to. Just don't scare him off and make it long. Keep it a peck. I've never been kissed because I'm really nervous around guys and he's prolly like that so I understand. He wouldn't agree to be your boyfriend if he didn't want it. If he wasn't ready he should'nt have agreed to be with you. You are kind of just friends if you don't kiss. I'm not saying to do anything more but yea if you been goin out for 8mos you need to kiss. HE'LL LOVE IT! HE'S JUST BEING NERVOUS!<br>  <br>  But don't do it if you're like a 6th grader or something lol then you'll just be silly.|`|remFpLGuaa	take him on a special date to show him you really care. if he's ready he will let you know. don't force a kiss on him cause that could scare him. give him time, but if you take him on a special date it will help him know you like him.|`|ExftbSP7aa	8 months is a little rediculous.<br>  honestly, he needs to get over it.<br>  how old are you guys ?<br>  if your like 11 thats cute.<br>  if your like 15, grow up.<br>  but seriously just kiss him.<br>  dont even ask.<br>  after it just happens its not that big of a deal.|`|mpjuyvuzaa	well you need to make him feel more confortable. tell him u never had a kiss either (even if you did) and take him somewhere alone and give him a little kiss, then if he feels more comfortable, go on and do it for real|`|orGvWwhBaa	Okay, this is worrying. How old are you? You've been together eight months without even kissing? Why are you even together? And why do you ASK if you can kiss him?

If you both have been together for 8 months then just do it. Grab him by the collar, pull him in and do it. He will never be ready at this rate so do like the mama bird and force him out of the nest. Being a guy he should like it, but then you may have to keep his filthy paws off you from that point on.|`|DUw4uaj6aa	Sweet <3<br>  First just try to inch your way up to him. Always hold his hand, And hug him. Be more comfy with him. Trust me, I know how eager you are to kiss him. Been there, Done that.<br>  In a few days after you've acted really close to him, Softly kiss him on the cheek and after a week or less you should get it in return. Then very soon it will turn into a kiss. Good luck :)|`|DEjKXcRZaa	Wow i have the same problem!<br>  when we first "made out" we were at the movies. alone in the dark lol<br>  maybe hes shy that he wont do it right, or basically he dosent want people to look at him. take your time and dont push to hard because then he wont want to.|`|QKqF2HqVaa	If he doesn't lean in to kiss you one steamy day...<br>  <br>  <br>  Then you lean in to kiss him, if he backs off then you back off.<br>  <br>  <br>  And say, well I guess we're not ready yet.|`|BLMn4owEaa	just kiss the guy!, he will enjoy it and will want to do it again but if they guy is nervous just dont do it in too public of a place|`|bLFqiqKbaa	Just  kiss him !

T9TK229Saa	I know saying, "Be yourself" sounds pretty lame but it's the best thing for you to do. A couple years ago I had feelings for this guy and whenever he was around or I would attempt to talk to him, I got really nervous and wasn't able to get past small talk. But then, I started really thinking about it and just said to myself, "There just as normal as you and it's not like they're going to hate you for the rest of your life if you look at them or try to start a real conversation with them." Which is 100% true. I know it's hard at first but now with me, I'm in a relationship with someone I have much in common with and is like my best friend. Which brings me to something else, having something in common when the person your into makes the conversation go much smoother, so try to figure out what there into. It might help. And try your best to look at them - if you don't, then there probably going to think somethings wrong with them. You should complement them, ask them how there day is going, girls like it when guys notice that kinda stuff and the attention definitely is plus in their eyes. I know it may seem hard and you may feel kinda stupid at first - thats how I started to feel at first but trust me, it works. Also, If there's not a connection, there's not a connection - it doesn't mean you did something wrong or they think your crazy, it just means it wasn't meant to be. So, just be yourself and you'll do fine. A|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	First, know what outside-of-school events are going on and make plans to go to these events. (Dances, sporting events, etc.) <br>  Learn from people that have already been to the event about what to wear and bring. If the event is something like a monthly dance, find out if you should just wear casual or formal clothes. You don't want to be wearing a tux when everybody is wearing what they wear in school and vice-versa. Then, find your best outfit possible for the event, or shop for one. Girls won't talk to you as eagerly if you're just flat out wearing the wrong clothes. Also, the right clothes will make the best first impression. <br>  Bring a few friends with you. This will help tremendously because not only will you look like you have the ability to make friends, you can introduce and start a conversation with girls your friends know without it being really awkward. <br>  With your group, physically approach the girl(s) you want to meet. You probably shouldn't approach the most popular girls in the whole school if you're not some of the most popular boys in your school, but if they're not that much more popular than you, go for it. Also, try to talk to girls that you and your friends know through classes, after school activities, etc. Try a slightly formal introduction; don't have a friend say, "Person 1, this is Person 2. Person 2, this is Person 1." <br>  Learn about the event you're at before it happens so you can use what you know about it to strike up a conversation with the girl(s). For example, if the event was a football game, learn maybe about the other team, like how their QB is an All-Met. But don't sound like an authoritative geek about the subject. <br>  The girl(s) may be at the event because they're interested in the subject. For example, if the event is a play, they might like drama. Ask them if they like to act or if they have hobbies concerning the event. If not, say either you do have a hobby concerning the event like a sport or that you don't have a hobby concerning the event, but then list some of your personal hobbies and ask them about theirs. This will help you to get to know each others' interests, which is very important. <br>  If you know that the girl is a certain label, like a prep, use that to start a conversation. Ask them where they shop at the mall or stuff like that and they could start to go on and on about the mall. Preps know basically everything there is to know about the mall. <br>  Keep the conversation flowing for about 10-20 minutes. Whenever some anecdote about something that someone says in a sentence pops into your head, share it. But don't lie, because then you'll have to think super fast for the answers to questions, and that's pretty hard to do. <br>  Throw in some humor, and when you tell a humorous story, a humorous tone makes it sound funnier. <br>  Get into a talk about cell phones and eventually ask girls for their number. <br>  Talk to your new friends in the hallways whenever possible. <br>  Repeat the process as many times as desired.|`|QZ1gWFGBaa	you just need to be yourself <br>  just say hi to whoever every once in a while <br>  then develop it from there <br>  your young <br>  there's time yet to have a girlfriend most people find by the time they are at university that is when they have a relationship <br>  just be yourself <br>  don't change for a girl because there not worth it <br>  the person who is right for you will like you for who you Truly are|`|ndwmn6Z4aa	just relax girls love shy guys like you|`|5s8fp6Dgaa	it takes practice|`|TiRhwBFAaa	ok i had almost the same convo with 1 of my friends. he tries too hard, the opposite of you. im sure you keep contact wen u r talking to u guy friends. and u can talk to them about stuff. think of easy questions at first like [if u dont noe them] wut school do u go to? how old are u? where do u like to shop. u just havta feel that they are comfortable around u and it will come to u. dont always on msn like ask them hey r u there b4 they have a chance to respond. dont forget to tell them the regulars: ur pretty, u luk nice, ect!!!|`|kHLwlNA5aa	It's hard for both sides to relax. Just be yourself. The worst thing that can happen is that you strike out. Then you move on and try to do better. It's important to really be yourself. If you put on some act, eventually you'll be found out. Just talk about general things. Nobody wants or expects you to talk quantum physics. It's not really what you say as much as it is talking some and being a good listener. If you don't put yourself out there, you've already lost. Therefor, you have nothing to lose. Keep at it. <br>  Wishing you the best of luck.|`|4EY0N5loaa	I don't see why you would behave differently around girls, not like they are walking sex machines (some of them are though) I think whats making you nervous around them is that ur not considering them as people but as potential sex. Just like guys women have likes and dislikes, you have to be friends with them and act naturally like they are guys around them and not want to get into their pants all the time. It's all a matter of ur view of women.|`|TnSB6rpeaa	This one is simple enough to fix. When you talk to girls ask them lots of questions about themselves. We tend to be a little on the chatty side when it comes to ourselves. It's a downfall of ours but it will help you out. Just as her about what her favorite foods are, ask her about her favorite memories. Stuff like that. The most important thing though is that if you are not confident enough to look a girl in the eyes then pretend that you areconfident enough because that is very important.|`|mpjuyvuzaa	well just thing of something of random, think of what she likes to talk about and start speaking, no one likes a shy boy, man up and start flirting.|`|AjD6Vm8Saa	have u ever had a gurl ? <br>  i guess not be like me im chill aroud with gurls just make jokes with them and make YOUR gurl (if u have 1) laugh dats all|`|JgEhGpydaa	ur nervous and thats fine!<br>  answer my question!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309143158AAMI0SB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	Go find a copy of the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. It is THE classic book on creating interpersonal relationships. It is a little old so the phrasing is a little dated, but the concepts have still been the same throughout the decades: how to relate to other people in a positive manner.<br>  <br>  One tip on how to keep a conversation going, remember the acronym FOR:<br>  Family<br>  Occupation (or school, if they're a student)<br>  Recreation<br>  <br>  Family could be where they grew up, where they're living now, what their parents did for a living, if they have brothers or sisters, if they have a pet, if they had a pet growing up, etc.<br>  <br>  Occupation would be what do they do for a living, how long have they been doing that, have they always been with that company, is it a big company, what does the company do. If they're a student, ask what year they are in, what they're studying, if they plan on going to grad school, what they plan on doing after they graduate, if they belong to any clubs on campus.<br>  <br>  Recreation: do you (golf/play tennis/like to read/insert your own interest)? Have you seen the movie Twilight (or any movie or TV show you might be familiar with)? What kind of music do you like? Have you eaten at (name of a restaurant you know)?<br>  <br>  If you pay close attention to their answers, you should be able to come up with follow-up questions that keep the conversation going. In fact, as they give their answer, you should be formulating the next question in your head:<br>  <br>  Do you live in Los Angeles?<br>  Not quite. I live in Long Beach.<br>  Is that where you grew up?<br>  No, I grew up in Minnesota.<br>  Oh, really? How do you like living in Southern California?<br>  ...<br>  Do your parents still live in Minnesota?<br>  ...<br>  Do you work in Long Beach, too?<br>  ...<br>  <br>  To get the confidence, you need to practice, practice, practice. The more you practice, the better you'll get at it. It's just like any other skill. Oh, and do it live, too. They have to be able to see your sincerity face-to-face.|`|3R8bAvfvaa	look in the mirror and compliment yourself.<br>  wear things that make you feel and look good. <br>  find a common interest you have with the girl and take it from there... even if its something as small as being the the same history class!!<br>  <br>  heres how ther coversation goes...<br>  did you do the history homework?<br>  no omg when is it in for?<br>  tomorrow<br>  damn, i'll have to do it now<br>  you want some help?<br>  yeah sure<br>  <br>  <br>  get the picture? just go with the flow and relaxxxx honey you'll be fine.<br>  besides, some girls like shy guys!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  email meeeeeeee :)<br>  natasha_jane@live.co.uk<br>  <br>  x|`|7fow1Wngaa	dn't worry.

Just the little bit between the eyes.<br>  <br>  And personally I find it really boring if someone asks me "How are you?" on facebook, msn etc. If I am on the internet on social networking sites it means that I'm OK and nothing that bad is happening. Try 'how was your day' or 'what music do you like?' Give them an open question which they will have to explain or expand upon.

Just think about things you did that day with the person you're talking to. Like... I hang out with a bunch of weird friends, ha ha. I talk to my boyfriend, and I tell him all the weird things they did that day. Except the example I'll give you is not exactly weird.<br>  <br>  For instance, I walked straight up to my boyfriend, and I said casually, "I'm sorry, I had to go get honors English papers for me and my best friend." Then he asked me why, and we branched on our conversation from that.<br>  <br>  Really, talking to us girls isn't that hard at all. We talk about the simplest things, at least, the normal ones do. If you're expecting to date a "super-popular-mega-hottie" or whatever, you'll end up with one mean bee, and that's definitely the truth. They talk about their manicures and their make-up and their clothes. Those are the boring girls in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Whatever floats your boat, you know? =)|`|qwvydopwaa	i used to hav the same problem dude...<br>  for me, i started IMing them, facebook messaging, etc. and then in school i would start saying hey and watsup to them wen i saw them...as my confidence grew, the conversations kind of started themselves and it kinda was a natural process of getting over my nervousness. its hard to get over this, but once you get over the hump its really easy to roll with it.<br>  overall my advice is to find a girl that shows some interest in you, and jst get to know each other (ask questions about her and build off that like music, sports if she plays any, tv shows she likes, and other interests) also make sure to keep it loose with a few sarcastic jokes to fool around with her...if she is into you, she'll laugh at basically anything.  i hope i could help...good luck to you|`|u9JxGwoHaa	Girls (i am a girl) like boys who can just step up and talk to them. I realise that you get nervous but only you can do something about that. You said out of school your braver and seem more easy going so why not get to know a girl out of school as a friend and this will make it easier if you talk to someone your used to and learn to keep eye contact. When i was 13 (i'm 18 now) i got really nervous around boys but i joined a drama group and it was easier to talk to them out of school when your more easy going, and it just improved my confidence, now all my friends except one is a boy and i've had a bf for 3 years so it worked for me. Hope it helps.
2og6l0w4aa	Well, im sorry.. but when people said to you growing up school is the most important thing its true... if you didnt do good in high school your screwed!! just take what you can get! and grow up friends fight, it makes them stronger.. you will learn that! you obviously care about your friend so be the bigger person and talk to em.

HKkbqlIuaa	I don't know really know the actual explanation, but I have had this happen to me before when I first started having sex. From what I've learned, this can be caused by one or more of several factors. 1.) I know it sounds stupid, but if you have to pee, it's just not going to work out. I dry up like a prune if I have to pee. 2.) If you have had an orgasm already, it can cause you to become dry. 3.) Sex is more psychological for women than for men. If there is the slightest thing wrong, and you have that thought in the back of your head, it could cause your body to stop producing the "juices." If you feel that you truly have a problem, you could call a doctor about it.|`|zprAkP3eaa	I do that every now and then, i believe it's b/c you went to long and you just became dry!|`|b2K8vZXNaa	it happens to me all the time... with me something triggers it though like if i hear something on tv during sex thats gross or funny, or i'll be thinking about how loud i am lmao and if his parents can hear and then i'll go dry too, but randomly it does happen i'm not exactly sure why it happens to men and women. guys randomly go limp for no reason too it's weird. stress, caffine, and other stimulants (alcohol) can do that to you also|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	the dryness on the next morning is normal.  maybe its just because of the dry up of the liquid of the night before but as soon as you start stimulate things will get better.

Grow up|`|AZB4BV64aa	When someone comes up to you and mocks you in your face you have to stand up for yourself. It's not as if no one has had embarassing moments before. You have to tell them that, and that it's just being immature to think they're above you just because you're not perfect. It really helps because people begin to feel guilty and say, "Well, I wouldn't like people to mock ME, right?". So yeah, try it out. Hope I helped. :)|`|1JtnI4SEaa	Don't sweat it. Eventually someone else will embarrass themselves and everyone will forget about you pocket full of tp. In the meantime, just laugh off the jokes people make. If someone makes a comment about it you in a mean way, just look them in the eyes, say "oh, I get it, because I had toilet paper in my pocket. Yeah," and then continue what you were doing.

A grieving process can take on many steps to achieve fulfillment such as denial, shock, then asking why, then getting angry (which can get out of hand so you really gotta watch this stage and not let it consume you), then realization that it was not meant to be or it would BE, and then, and only then, can you begin to look outside yourself and see there are other ways to find happiness with someone else. Although if you find yourself feeling suspicious of a new relationship, you're simply not ready to be in one. That's my take, for what it's worth.|`|19ea0ffe56f1755c71f275c227e7fe16aa	quit focusing all your energy on the failed relationship.  go out and now do something for others.  charity.  give. help.  it will make you feel good, helpful, resourseful, full of purpose, and will change how you feel about yourself associated with this failed relationship.  right now you feel bad about yourself so do things and remind you that you are a good strong person capable of handling change, of growing and bettering yourself and learning from your mistakes.  look upon this failed relationship as something that came into your life to teach you something that you will need to draw upon for a future relationship.  good stuff.  good luck.|`|4tvAtQRSaa	Get busy with something.

ehAG30Yvaa	If she asked for some space you really need to give her some time to figure out where she's going and what she wants at this point in her life. The good thing is that she's already told you that she can see herself marrying you so chances are she will eventually come around. Absence makes the heart grow fonder so give her some space and time and if you are meant to be together things will work out.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	It sounds like she is conflicted about something but not that it is necessarily you. It might be a fear of commitment or a fear of being hurt that she feels she needs to work through alone. give her the space she has asked for but not for too long. I would draw the line at about two weeks. Beyond that and this was just a nice way of blowing you off.|`|QFEmv60haa	I dont know she might need space and she really dont know what to do.  Or she is leaving herself opne to explor other things and she felt breaking up with you is best.

I have never heard of something like this b4.  You have to ask her what is the purpose of you guys breaking up?  That's Number 1!!!!!  If she wasn't sure about the relationship why did she tell you she see's herself marrying you? I personally think there is something weird going on.  Does she want to feel what the single life is by exploring what's out there?  That's not fair to you!!!!  Unless you do the same?  To me she is leaving you for second best.  If she don't find what she likes out there she'll come back!  If she does like what she finds out there she don't need you!  She knows you want her back and that's another reason why she can do this to you!  This is just my opinion.... No one can really answer this question seriously!  We don't know the true reason why she is doing this to you.  Only she does.  It's up to you if you agree with this relationship!|`|U2csHMUoaa	yes you definitely do have a chance with her, he just have to keep your distance.

xG04jzOEaa	If he makes you feel this way (so upset, confused, etc) you should just break all contact.  Change your cell # or block his #.  <br>  Trust me, remaining "friends" with an ex can be disastrous.  You should just move on completely.  I know it's really hard to not be bothered by what is going on, but you can deal with it, and it will get easier.|`|iRZ4Y2bLaa	Ok.<br>  <br>  Good thing is that you both left off on good terms and decided to be friends.<br>  Since he did not text back do not over think it. <br>  Give him space.<br>  Do not call him a lot, and if he calls you and you don't answer do not call him back.<br>  To make it easier on yourself, think of him as a gay friend.

SovaFpN8aa	He's telling you to choose between your husband and him. He wants you, but is too afraid to make a move. DROP HIM - HE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Clearly this is a true friend. He's see's that you aren't being treated right, and that hurts him, because he is a REAL friend. Clearly he can stand to sit back and see you being treated this way and he knows you will just stay in the marriage and continue to be treated like that, so he would rather not be in your life, so he doesn't have to see you getting walked all over.<br>  <br>  I say grow a pair! And leave this jerk of a husband.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	He thinks you are a doormat, and I agree. It is hard to watch someone you care for walk on eggshells so as not to "upset" their partner. Set some limits for your hubby--one time per month out with his pals, the rest with you.<br>  God knows what (or WHO) he's doing when you aren't around. He probably thinks you don't even care what he does.|`|G50ucmllaa	He's mad that you are being naive and letting your husband go out even after he cheated.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You ask this a lot.|`|f7aed8ce48808e701a4034d72a8b8bd6aa	I think there are a couple of things going on here.  Obviously yor friend cares for you very much.  He may even have a crush on you.  <br>  <br>  If you trust your friend it is important for you to  listen to him.  I'm guessing he is seeing that your husbands patterns haven't changed.  That would lead one to the logical conclusion that your husband may be getting into the same kind of red handed trouble you caught him at before.  It does make sense that if you saw smoke one time and found fire that when you continue to see smoke there is still fire there.  If your friend cares for you sincerely he will tell you things you need to hear even if they are difficult.  He has probably been holding them in waiting for you to "catch on" but got frustrated and finally had to say something and it came out not too appropriately.  Please pay attention.  He may think you aren't listening to him.<br>  <br>  With his friendly affection for you he probably thinks of you in ways other than a friend.  I've been there.  It is tough to see a dear friend being mistreated and she not even noticing it.  Especially hard when you have a crush on her.  <br>  <br>  I think it is time for you to have a calm sincere deep conversation with your friend.  It is often true that a real friend lasts longer than a spouse, and certainly longer than most lovers.|`|wpi36XBAaa	If he's just a really good friend he's tired of hearing how badly you've been treated when you aren't willing to take ANY action to make it change. That if you're willing to put up with sh*t, he shouldn't have to listen to it, year after year. He's frustrated with you and your inaction. He's given you good advice but you choose to ignore it.He hurts for you. But knows any change has to come from you, and you don't seem to want to. <br>  If he's come to think of you as more than a good friend, he's probably wondering why you choose to stay in that situation when he could offer you so much better. And be frustrated that you can't see him standing there as something more than just a guy friend. <br>  As to which it is you either have to ask him, or be prepared to let him go. <br>  Venting to a friend is one thing, but doing nothing about a bad situation is just foolish.|`|8e80ba6931ed694f003ea5e88569a2feaa	seems to me your friend is a true friend! He doesn't like seeing you being treated that way!|`|8g3Uz6PCaa	I think he is just trying to show you that you need to talk to your husband and tell him how you feel, so he is kind of showing you how he see's what's going on. However, I don't know what your husband did to you so i shouldn't really say anything.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	He's attracted to you on some level and wants in your pants<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  He's not attracted to you, was trying to be a good friend by laying it out for you...<br>  <br>  I hate to be the one to tell you this - but guy friends don't want to hear about your problems.  Just as a husband is ill-equipped to listen completely - so are guy friends...they are problem solvers...if you want a sympathetic ear - try a girlfriend.|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	He is trying to tell you that you need to be telling your husband these things not him also you playing stupid like you don't know what he means will just get on his nerves too. By the way your spelling is atrocious!|`|V0qntsyZaa	You think he might not want to be your friend?  I agree and I think it is for one of two reasons, well, maybe both and others<br>  <br>  He is probably sick of you ranting to him instead of to the person responsible and because you continue to live in your situation.<br>  <br>  One other thing...he loves you.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Well, it sounds to me like you guy friend is really in love with you and he can't stand the fact that you are married to a loser and he can't have you. <br>  Also, your husband cheated on you and you let him off to easy. He wants to go out on his own all the time, hmm...I wonder why?|`|b8by7fSKaa	There are 2 scenarios to this: <br>  (1) He has probably been telling you that you allow your husband to treat you like a door mat and you refused to listen.  It is very difficult for someone from the outside looking in and see something totally different that what you are seeing and because you are in the middle of the situation; you are not seeing things as clearly as you should.<br>  (2) He's in love with you and do not know how to express his feeling to you because he is afraid that you will REJECT him.  <br>  Like my husband always tell me, men do not have female friends, and I do see some truth in that statement, it's like they are not designed for this friendship thing, LOL. <br>  You MUST know that there is some truth in what he is telling you. May be you are afraid of leaving because you don't want to start over or be alone. Sometimes it is better to be by yourself than being in a relationship and being alone!<br>  He is trying to separate himself from you, because he's hurt right now, and probably because he almost slipped up telling you how he truly feels about you. It is very difficult to stand by and see the people you love being hurt and there is nothing you can do to help!<br>  Giving your husband some space to go out and enjoy time with his friends is 1 thing, but he should have respected you enough to know that he's Married and not a Single man any longer.  Your husband IS walking all over you and you are Allowing him to do so with permission. There can not be a marriage is there is no repsect, and it does not seems to be that your husband repsect you one bit.  you DESERVE much better than this, listen to your friend.  <br>  Why are you letting him walk all over you like this; just ask yourself this - when you have children of your own, would you want your children to see you being disrespected this way or see them living in your situation?|`|bjt4M3Icaa	You posted this already. Move on already. Your wasting so much time on this friend of yours when you could be using this time to work on your marriage.|`|4832d4b747022103886cd68f1ad6feb2aa	Your friend went off on you because he is a drama king, plain and simply put.<br>  <br>  He is probably attracted to you and he may even be right about your husband, but the way he responded to you was just unnecessary.  That is, unless of course, you use him as a listening post whenever you have issues with your husband, which you shouldn't do.<br>  <br>  It's your choice if you want to forgive your husband, but if you don't like him going out, you should say so.  Never be afraid to state how you feel to your mate.  That's supposed to be your number one, and if you can't talk to him, who can you talk to?<br>  <br>  That being said, you now know that you cannot talk to this guy about your marriage because he is internalizing the info a little too much.  That could be damaging to your marriage.  If you decide to end your marriage, it should be your decision and not the result of a 3rd party and their meddling.

dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Alimony has nothing to do with kids.<br>  <br>  Child support is for the kids.  Alimony is for the spouse.  To assist them financially until they can become self sufficient.  There are a number of different reasons why a person might be entitled to alimony.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Child support is for the child and alimony is for the wife or husband. One has nothing to do with the other one. They are totally separate.<br>  <br>  Most states require a couple to be married for 7 or 10 years in order to qualify for alimony. If your spouse never worked or made a lot less money then you did and because of your income, the two of you were able to live a much better life then your spouse could of lived without you, then there is a very good chance you will have to pay alimony.<br>  <br>  Now you get a divorce and suddenly your spouse who has very little education or work experience finds herself/himself unable to continue living in the manner they are use to living in. This person needs to get an education or a good paying job and needs financial help until they can get on their feet and become financially independant. This is where alimony comes in. Usually alimony is temporary. It may last one year or a couple of years. It will depend on what your ex-spouse is doing to improve her or himself in order to become financially independant. If your ex-spouse is just staying home and living off the alimony and not going to college or trying to find full time employment, then the judge will probably see fit to cancel the order of alimony after one year. If your spouse is working part time and attending college full time in order to get a good paying job when they graduate, chances are you will have to pay alimony for a much longer period of time.|`|AA10886262	it depends on where you live, there is no alimony in Indiana.  Alimony is separate and in addition to child support if you do have kids; Alimony is usually a temporary thing 1-2 years so that the person receiving it gets time to get a job and get on their feet.....spousal support is another term for it.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I think alimony is only acceptable in VERY few select cases.<br>  <br>  Alimony is spousal support.  It's designed if your spouse was accustomed to a certain lifestyle while with you, to enable her to (somewhat) maintain that lifestyle after the divorce if she couldn't otherwise on her own.<br>  <br>  I ONLY find alimony to be acceptable if the marriage was more than 10 years, and the wife was a stay at home mom for most of the marriage.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, alimony is a complete joke, and only taken advantage of by gold diggers.|`|mMBzpldbaa	alimony (spousal support) is a joke. people have a choice to sit at home and not work; it is not their spouses fault.|`|mCM363I9aa	every state has different laws, it depends|`|b8by7fSKaa	You need to check with your state where you live.  I believed that alimony came about when 1 spouse worked during the marriage & now that they are no longer together the support is to assist the other 1 get back on her (usually this is how it work) feet.  <br>  You see those movies out there that have the wife worked 3 jobs putting her husband through medical school, and now that he is successful, he divorced her to married someone who is 1/2 his age.<br>  These days you have gold diggers that will milked you for every dime you have and will earn.  In some states, you would have to pay alimony until the other person is marry again (so if he/she decided to shack up with someone else, you are supporting him/her FOREVER.)<br>  Then again, he/she would need to show that he/she deserved to get alimony!  A good lawyer will be able to work out the term of alimony, i.e. amount, length of time...|`|ArHSNXuraa	generally alimony is paid because the other party can not maintain the life style that they had when they lived with you for numerous reasons..their job doesn't pay enough, they have not worked in so many years, the list goes on.  sometimes alimony is even handed out with child support it depends on the state and the judge.  Also, from what i have found out that you generally have to be married for so long before alimony will even be in the equation.|`|V0qntsyZaa	Alimony is assigned with or without having children if the spouse will be living well below the standard set in the marriage, the spouse needs time for education to become employed at a standard as close as possible to the past marital standard, until a certain date or the time they remarry.<br>  <br>  Alimony like a divorce is an agreement by the spouses that is reviewed for certain mandated standards and/or for fairness.  Sometimes beyond the set standards it is all about who has the better attorney.|`|rlQOjyhbaa	well alimony is for living of the spouse child support is the kids but maybe yes depends does she have a job did you do something wrong and also depends on the state|`|cO8b7Pniaa	It depends on a lot. Check out your state laws.
1JtnI4SEaa	Leave her alone. She blocked you on Facebook, stopped returning your calls and texts, and now you are thinking about driving an hour to see her at work? Just forget about her. Even if she was telling you that she would like to hang out with you, something has happened since then to make her change her mind. I know that this sounds harsh, but its the truth. Just delete her from your phone and move on. If I am wrong about this she will contact you.|`|LRV65TbHaa	"And so i don't sound desperate,"<br>  <br>  ^^ That's exactly what you are.

BUT, ask them the same exact question of us, & naturally their ans. no doubt be very much the same as ours would be. You've heard of the expression of "let me count the ways"!  Well, we both could do a very good list of "to each their own"!  I feel as long as we do NOT even hope to live our lives in a non so perfect world, we are ALWAYS going to find conficting things in ALL areas of our lives.  As long as these things are not going to bring the world to a screaching halt, we can find they are bearable & we'll still be able to live w/one another & also be able to love one another.  To me, that's the MOST IMPORTANT thing we need to worry ourselves over.  I would NOT let the trivial annoying habits overcome some of the very large obstical things we could very well have,  I feel is the least we can do.  At least we KNOW we'll be waking up to one that might drive us crazy one day or another, but can be thankful we'll at least be waking up to him & not have to worry that some sickness or disease might "take him" in the nite & we'll wake up to him being gone from our lives for good.  It's the little things in life that boil down to meaning the most in life!  Regardless of all the annoying things we deal with on daily basises, what would we honestly do w/o them when it comes rite down to it.  All the best to you, & guess it's all in the way you look at things as in "just how important is it"...:)|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Well girl....you were in a relationship with a pig....LOL<br>  My fiance' has no annoying habits...I have been trying to find fault with him and believve it or not, I can't find any faults.  He is as perfect as me.  When you truly love someone, you don't pick him apart and look for the worst in him.  You are supposed to accept the man that you love for who and how he is.  I guess that is why the "pig" is now your ex.  And why are you still worried about what he used to do when he was with you?  You've not achieved closure yet, huh?  Hey, maybe you'll find a man with no faults, that way you will have to be perfect too???!!!|`|MjSLQlIHaa	she's messy as hell i get so tired of her leaving her damn pocket book in the kitchen on the counter! drives me crazy!|`|X55EHXeVaa	he drives me crazy, i can't live with him but i can't live without him|`|AA11437235	farting at the wrong time.. hahah just kidding.|`|aQ1FzL7maa	yes|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	they all have annoying habit's that's why we love em.|`|wjUwKsvWaa	he drops his clothes wherever he feels (all over the house)<br>  leaves his dishes and does not put them in the sink<br>  picks his nose in public and thinks its ok<br>  leaves wet towels on my rug so they can smell like mildew<br>  snores really loud|`|UEcEAId5aa	I had an ex who could not spell worth cr@p, and did not understand how to use punctuation.

4EY0N5loaa	My taste in women are women who are strong, independent but not antisocial, outgoing and passionate but not slutty. They would take care of their appearance but not wear a giant mask of makeup, they wouldn't behave all cutesy but more dignified. But they would be flirtatious from time to time. If you have a crush on a guy, give them eye contact and small hints from time to time that you like them. And dont act like a slut major turn off.|`|ML7FRVzIaa	Thanks for asking this question! i need to know lol|`|AA10495394	Maybe you should be more appealing to them. Fix yourself up, wear some sexier clothes. That way you may get more attention from the males|`|OULT64VJaa	I look to whom they are. How/what she speaks usually reflects what is in her heart. Also actions tell many words. Don't always go by  what someone speaks, you might want to prove them by looking at his/her fruits.|`|UXarq5Tdaa	makeup and more girly clothes will do the trick .. don't start acting flirty as someone suggested that will not make them like you|`|5tGiVemXaa	personally in school when a girl has a great smile i think wow shes amazing or u can go the for a slut and show of everything|`|3k4tPNTGaa	start wearing some exposing clothes and try to talk to them in a sexy way.|`|mcR3zWFbaa	Believe it or not, some of the things that attract guys are the same ones that attract girls. Eye contact is a VERY important element of attraction. It's hard to use too much. Learn how to use physical touch effectively and with everyone, not just guys. Lead the conversation. These are all things that boost your social value.<br>  <br>  All guys like a girl who smells nice (but not like a flowery explosion). Dress modestly but with style. <br>  <br>  Make sure you're friends with other girls. Make friends with girls you look up to who are successful in attracting guys. If you don't have many female friends, it can be hard for guys to see you as anything more than one of the guys.<br>  <br>  If you want a guy to look at you as boyfriend material, you have be the type of person he wants to date. Are you happy with yourself? If you're already confident in who you are, the right guy will come around eventually.|`|NAfH4v9Naa	thats a though one.  if you like one of the boys, they like it when you look at them and make eye contact or wink.  they like it when you give them complements.  they also like it if you just tell them you like them.  you dont know maby they feel the same way about you.  im haveing the same problem(xcept im a guy) email me and tell me what girls like and what signs they will give you to let guys know they like 'em.  theres a girl i really like and i dont know what to do.|`|wqCznap2aa	looks, personality, trust, feminism, intelligence, sense of humor, confidences, and fun to be around|`|D5UAhY8jaa	well first of all i aint like most of these perv guys so ill i can tell you is i look for a girl with beautiful eyes and a good personality|`|mvSFD8LNaa	Start being more flirty and comforting and cute:)|`|kXgtx4EKaa	well they problay on care bout ur looks.|`|iVWfyNiUaa	get breast surgery, or go to realcollegebasketball.com.  or just ask one out|`|mVbZVYaHaa	flirt more, without being a slut.<br>  but actually, when boys fancy a girl they try to hang around with them more and become better friends.so if you think they look on you only as a friend, you could be wrong.

I'm not sure if we do this to stay connected, or if we are already so connected that we just instinctivly do it, but it is a way that we have to stay close when we are apart.|`|498JdszFaa	I somehow get the feeling you are giving it all away without expecting anything in return apart from great sex. Great sex is nice, but if he may soon take you for granted, since you're all over him all the time. <br>  What is he doing for you?|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	You've been with him for two years!  That means you should trust your gut instinct and do what has worked for you in the past couple years.  If he has an issue, he'll let you know.|`|KcHhLsCAaa	Yea, its nice.|`|1HTRWrawaa	I'm confused! You have been with this guy for two years and you don't know how he feels and what he would or would not like? <br>  <br>  Don't you think it's time to ask him, how he would feel if you sent him one text a day to remind him that you love and miss him? Or you could just try sending him one short text "I love and miss you." Then when you see him, ask him what he thought of your text. Then ask him if it's alright for you to send him a text once in a while or would he prefer you didn't do that. If he says it's okay, just don't get carried away.<br>  <br>  Some people go nuts over sending text messages and send their spouse or boy/girlfriend dozens of "I love you" messages every day. There is such a thing as too much of a good thing.

And if you really want to make an impression you should call her, so she can hear your voice, hear the feeling in it.  Texting is too impersonal.<br>  <br>  Now on the subject of her "being sick " on the night of the dinner it sounds like she may be avoiding you, or i could just be paranoid and she really was sick that night , but chances are she was just making up an excuse to cancel dinner plans.|`|rEs4Y5Niaa	If it ended because of arguing you probably shouldn't get back together. <br>  But you can still talk to her about it to see how it all goes and how she still feels. <br>  If you are nervous you should text her... that's what I would do. I don't like to be embarrassed and stuff so I text or email. Then they won't hear your voice. <br>  But if you are not nervous there's nothing wrong will calling her.|`|Ycb7826Vaa	she's waiting for you! call her!|`|4JctVHp8aa	This is such a sticky situation. You have to first realize that not matter how much effort you put into the situation now, it will never be as it once was. This isn't a bad thing, it is just that people and things change. So if you are looking to get back with her in hopes of having what you had previously, you may want to take some time out and see what you learned about yourself and the situation before jumping head first.<br>  <br>  If you are truly ready to commit, and accept this person for who they are (arguing and all) I wouldn't let her slip out of your fingers. Just try and take things super slow, try seeing a couple counselor, or looking up ways to have a healthy relationship online, these help! Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't push too hard, if you keep trying and nothing comes of it. Let her have her space and she will either come around when she is ready or she won't. Try and keep an open miond and an open heart!|`|uGY1eopqaa	you should text her something cute like "hey beautiful, just seeing if you're feeling better." it'll make her smile and happy that you thought of her. but don't text more than once, it'll make you seem desperate and might make her weary of getting back into things with you. also, if you guys do start talking about getting back together, discuss the things that you can do differently so you're not back in the same situation. good luck. :)|`|AA10923106	She told you she was sick the night that you guys were to go out.

First date advice! I love these!<br>  Well you made a good choice. Usually double dates are the best because when it's just the two of you it can get very awkward.<br>  Well, you gotta seem just like the nice girl. If it's the horror movie use the famous "dig-into-the-guys-shoulder" thing as if you were afraid. It will make him seem more manly (guys like to, trust me) and you'll be really close to him.<br>  If he used the little trick where he yawns and puts his arm around your shoulder, smile showing you noticed, but do nothing. He will see you liked it and boom! More hopes for a good date.<br>  And whatever you do, do NOT exclude anyone in parallel conversations. It is the worst thing that can happen to you, seriously.<br>  Hope I helped. :D|`|TnSB6rpeaa	Don't make out with him in the movies. That's tacky, and tell your friend the same.

He could possibly be one of those people, and you could be one of those people, I don't know. Good luck with your movie date!<br>  <br>  By the way... My first movie date was also a double date.

Not going to lie but it probably wont be the best kiss you ever get.

He has moved on with this new girl and you need to do the same. Maybe in a few years time when you are both over this and happily with partners you can perhaps talk and be friends.

If she were to find out about you  I guarantee she would never trust you again.  You would no longer be seen as a nice guy anymore or would want a child looking up to you as he/she is growing up.  You are not a good role model.  <br>  <br>  Better start changing your ways.|`|XdBN0uO8aa	I am pretty sure your GF would not be ok with the fact that you have a lover. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Remember what goes up must come down and you will get caught.

Either you're being honest with everyone involved or your not.  <br>  <br>  ...and you're not.|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	That would be called cheating on your girlfriend, because she doesn't know.

I hope she finds out soon so she's aware of the type of man she's dealing with and potential health risks you bring to her...even if you use a condom, what you are doing is still nasty. <br>  <br>  Afraid of making custody arrangements and paying child support? Never use a child as an excuse to stay with someone you don't really love. And do you even care about the example you are setting for your child? You know that what you're doing is not ok. If you must have this other woman, you need to get out of the relationship with your girlfriend.|`|kTZevQNHaa	In this case what you describe?=NO.<br>  <br>  It's not the age thing..it's the fact you're a deceitful liar that makes it wrong.<br>  <br>  OK-put it this way--if you  can't tell the  gf about the side dish, then it's wrong.<br>  <br>  And you point out the side dish is a milf...ok--so is that gonna make things any more right with the gf if you point THAT out?<br>  No...what the hell difference does it make who you're cheating on her with?<br>  <br>  Cheating and lying is wrong..and you know that...you're just looking for attention...bragging about U with 2 women.<br>  Using the child as an excuse to deceive is lame.<br>  Leave the mother of the child and pay child support and be a good dad simultaniously...set the Mom free...you set NO good example for the child being a dad who deceives the child's Mother...that's just so damned lame to use the kid as some qualifying factor--that don't wash here...nice try.<br>  --and you know that.<br>  That doesn't make you special...special is if you had the 2 of them knowing about each other...and still hanging around cause you're so hot--which is NOT the case...you're just another boring cheater...your type is a dime a dozen.<br>  <br>  It would fine IF you have an open/ casual  relationship--but it doesn't  sound like you do.There's no "understanding" here where the gf can also sleep around and see other guys--you're keeping her faithful and under the impression you're in a committed relationship... and so you're being deceitful...so pick one or be single.<br>  Sounds like you want your cake (gf) and to <br>  eat it too (lover) and that's not right.<br>  Pick one...or be single.<br>  You can't have it both ways without being a liar.Morally--you're cheating and playing the gf for a fool...decidedly: behind her back.<br>  <br>  UPDATE: yeah-- so what if the side dish she's a milf?<br>  That's supposed to excuse you for being a **deceitful oaf**?<br>  <br>  Stop cheating on the young gf and let her go find a man who won't cheat on her.|`|ZbxcHDh2aa	Your a God damn player look how many answers you have had and you only posted this question 5mins ago..|`|ruczpWrGaa	no its not cool.  only one of them knows.  your not giving your girlfriend a choice in the matter. you a slimeball.|`|5ptkqtAgaa	no way is that allright to do. id say stay with your girlfriend and get rid of your lover that is way too old for you|`|Bsf78pfsaa	your girlfriend would be so mad and the 40 doesnt care because she just wants you satisfying her your a jerk|`|uhRKCb9kaa	no idea|`|NgawN7Pcaa	oh my jeebus .<br>  hahaaa :)<br>  thats nott good .|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	Sometimes its good to think of yourself, but you have to consider other peoples feelings too.

Nature did not intend for the reproductive process to last a long time. <br>  <br>  Really, it's something you just need to learn to relax about. Stressing out can make the problem worse, or lead to erectile dysfunction. Wearing a condom can also help because it reduces your sensitivity - not to mention the benefit from preventing pregnancy and STDs.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	If you're that insecure, you won't enjoy it.  Don't think of sex as a big performance, but rather something to share with a person you care deeply about.  If you are really really worried about going too early, just pleasure her with foreplay.

And we worry about our performance as much as you guys do.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	use ambesol (that stuff you put on your teeth when they hurt).<br>  <br>  This will numb the little guy and you wont be so sensitive. <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Get drunk first and obtain whiskey dick!|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	Pleasure the woman/girl first (tongue, finger etc.) then it doesn't matter.

This might buy you some time. <br>  <br>  But most important, you need to prolong sex and make it pleasurable with foreplay and teasing. When you start slipping down that orgasmic slope - STOP! withdraw and move on to caressing and kissing. Kiss her neck and kiss, lick and nibble her ear lobes along with her breasts and nipples. You need time for your urge to pass. Be thinking of sexy scenarios that are of fantasy quality. You possibly might need to train your mind to TURN OFF and be cold as ice, just so you can avoid an eruption. Its all in your mind.|`|OT97dWswaa	Extra Safe Condoms, Masturbating Before Hand, You CAN purchase certain delay sprays, thing is none of this really matters - first time, you probably should either be with someone you're entirely comfortable with, then at least if the 1st time goes wrong, the second time should be better - or there is the whole 'practise girl' idea, which can work - just one to get it done with.<br>  <br>  Fact is though, most guys won't completely fulfill a lady through penetrative sex alone, so its always best to make up for it in other areas - most of all, its supposed to be fun, enjoy :)|`|aEbEc6ZNaa	just practice holding it as long as yu can :]<br>  <br>  dont worry; tht wont turn many girls off! go for it!<br>  <br>  good luck shootin :] haha|`|Ym9Er1fUaa	Lawl, Im the oppisite, I've masterbated so much that when i got my first BJ and HJ it was about for 2 hours and I never blew but its because she was drunk and she was doing it really slowly and softly and she asked me if I was even close to yet and I was like nope lol.

AA10065812	??????????<br>  I assume you've been shacking up and impregnating several women.  In essence, 55% of your gross divided among them, plus $1000-$5000 per child support claim in court costs.  <br>  <br>  To get any visitation rights, it will cost you $3000-$10,000 per mother, per case, in court and attorney fees.  <br>  <br>  If any of them denies you access to the child, figure on spending roughly $1000 per time you get to see the child in court and attorney fees.<br>  <br>  If any of one of them decides to use a false allegation against you, such as child sexual abuse, it will cost you $50,000+ to prove your innocence, during which contact with all your children will be cut off.  Further, you will go on a national listing of ones who have been suspected of it.  That listing is permanent.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	No differences are made according to the law.

JhvqUvlsaa	You are very honorable and I admire that. <br>  <br>  I think you are going to have to let her go; when you cut things off she obviously couldn't handle it and got angry so now shes trying to hurt you. So don't let it get to you and let her go. Give her some space to figure out her feelings cuz it sounds like she has been confused for a while. Then when she contacts you again, see how her actions play out. If she still does things to annoy you or gives you mixed signals, then keep her at arm's length; you are right that this is not good for you and you could move on and find someone new.<br>  <br>  Good luck
hrU14wMDaa	Some 4 yr olds are just shy and quiet around certain people. My child has always been shy around some and not around others. He is an extremely sweet kid. I have neighborhood kids ages 3-10 in my home a lot for different get-together parties and just to play, and some don't say a word to me -- they are shy and reserved and extremely nice kids. <br>  <br>  She is 4 - you must remember that. You are actually relatively new in her life. You should try to nicely engage her by taking crayons and paper or other crafts to her home and ask her to help you make something. She will warm up to you eventually.<br>  <br>  Let me add a tip on the crafts. If she doesn't want to do the craft with you. Just sit down and start doing it. And say, "Um, (insert name), do you think I should use blue or red? I can't decide." Just keep trying to engage her by using questions and ask her to help you draw something. Say, that you heard she draws really pretty trees or something and that you'd like to learn how. Kids love helping adults. This is what I do with kids and it works for me. If she still won't join you, try drawing a plane or whatever and say, "Hey, (insert name) look at this really pretty flower that I drew." This usually will get a reaction from them because it is not a flower. Then that is your time to get them to show you how to draw a flower. Of course, once she draws anything, you need to oooh and ahhh and tell her how pretty it is.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	she's FOUR...gimme a break<br>  wait till you have a 4 year old, then you'll know they don't even know what thank you means, even though they should be told to say it.

gQBqgzJmaa	It could be that you're expecting to be awkward, or you're really afraid of being awkward, so naturally your mind tenses up and goes into that state.  It's the same with trying not to be afraid or trying not to think about something.<br>  <br>  What you need is to focus your mind ON something, instead of on your awkwardness.  Make a list in advance of thoughtful questions to ask people (people LOVE to talk about themselves), and if you come into an awkward silence, as them a question and listen to them.  People will like you for being a good listener (a very rare thing) and being interested in their lives, and won't care if you come into an awkward moment later on.|`|M1J4xDJgaa	that happened to me, 7th grade i had a group of friends, then the next year, grade 8, i felt awkward at them then made a new group of friends

She could be the ugliest woman in the world and still be married.

She's beautiful and so are you !!
j1k8qGd6aa	Hopefully she realizes what a nice guy you're being buy being a good friend to her and realizes that that bf is all wrong for her. Maybe try and ask a question hypothetically like "if there was a guy out there better than the bf you have now would you date him? How would he be like? Would you ever date a friend?" some questions a long those lines to try and see her thoughts on them, or "I know if I had a girl like you I'd treat her a hell of a lot better" by asking these questions she may pick up on that you're interested and comment about it if she has the same feelings towards you, she might pick up on these feelings and not reciprocate them but not say anything to you to keep your friendship and not hurt you, or she might really not know what you're getting at and answer the question. In any case you might get a feel for what she's thinking by asking these questions. My fiance and I were very close friends for about 4 years neither one of us knowing we shared romantic feelings for the other. Even though it took us a long time to get into a romantic relationship I wouldn't trade the friendship we built because I could see from me talking to him about other guy problems or work, school etc. and he was always there to listen and other things that he was a special guy and other guys started not doing so well after I compared them to him. So keep being patient, and she might see that your the right type of bf but if she doesn't share your feelings think about whether you'd still be okay with just being her friend and whether you want to the risk of ruining a great friendship to pursue a relationship. Good luck!

OtKCAeQZaa	We all weary about the ones we love .Do you trust him, for remember that with out trust in a relationship that there is no relationship. For it will end with much hatred towards one another. Jealousy was never happiness.|`|f6YsGOynaa	You're probably driving him nuts by making him adjust his plans while yours keep changing.  This is his work and probably already stressful enough without you and your daughter along needing to be entertained.  <br>  <br>  And it's "wary" not "weary."  Weary means you're tired.  Wary means you're suspicious.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Forget about going now. When it was just you, he was happy with it.

ni7TFFPWaa	To be honest, it doesn't sound like he is interested in any relationship. Or perhaps (and don't take this the badly) maybe he doesn't want to be with you. The simple matter of the fact is that love is strong, and if its real then there is always a way to make things good so long as both people still have that love. In reading your story I simply see someone who is more interested in a job then you or even his education. Do yourself a favor and stop fretting over this guy, there's many a boy out there and life will carry on with or without him. Trust me on this, I have loved and lost and gone through so much crap because of worry, only to find that things become even better the next time around with someone new. So cheer up and move on, but do so at your own pace.|`|tTabBH4caa	ahh, yea that really suckks.<br>  I'm guessing it is just a breakk but guys are stupid and liars most of the time so its really hard to tell. i have had alot of boyfrandd problems before, but i really thinkk that this is just a breakk and he is still theyre not needing to come backk, likke he will always be there.<br>  well i donno if this helped, but good luckk(:<br>  -morgan|`|HmnAjfINaa	aww hunni it sounds like he really dos want to be with you but due to circumstances he can't and he don't ant to hold you back, no one can tell u if you should trust him only you can because you know him more than anyone but it he sounds like e needs to sort things out so he can be with you  be the girlfriend who stuck with him through that tough time and that his definition of love sounds right but to only those who are faithful enough not to take it as an advantage and it sounds to me like he wont and he will be there for you when te time is right :)<br>  <br>  much love<br>  <br>  kat x|`|5YEKmHqyaa	I believe he loves you and wants to be with you I think he just needs time to get his stuff together; as in work.

I'm sure he'll be back he just needs to get his work life straight first.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	no idea|`|q5e0PYqPaa	boys are stupid. the end.|`|d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	You need to move on with your life. <br>  Your boyfriend warned you that he is committed to working at this point  in his life and wouldn't be able to give you much time or attention and you chose to get involved anyway. <br>  Accept the fact that even though you might love each other, you're just at different stages in your lives. Maybe one day you guys will be able to have a good relationship but now is obviously not that time. <br>  If you want a boyfriend that is completely devoted to you  and who wants to give you all his time and energy then you need to go out and find one, because you want something your current boyfriend just isn't able to give you right now. <br>  I don't think you should base your entire life around your boyfriend, especially when he is focused on work right now. Let him go, move on with your life and find a boyfriend who is ready to be with you NOW, not in a couple of years when he's less stressed at work.|`|GtFH9zxbaa	Leave.. <br>  When ppl say stuff like this its usually bologna.

Like anything worthwhile achieving in life, a relationship requires time and commitment to grow and develop.<br>  <br>  If he is so busy that he is finding it difficult to meet with you at least once a week, then you should be questioning the strength of this relationship.  You should both be freed up enough to be able to date other people.<br>  <br>  The fact that he went ahead and started dating you after already having known his work commitments and the agreement that the two of you had already had, does not bode well for future things.  What other agreements are the two of you going to break?<br>  <br>  Just date other people and tell him so.  If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.  We all need to be patient with the other person but not unreasonably so.  We need to know that our main romantic relationship is at least growing and going some where, or there is little point in hoping for what might not ever happen.  Because the danger is that the other person will just keep putting it off and putting it off, while we put our lives on hold in some manner for them.|`|JWNzoksmaa	seems like he uses his work as a break up method.  this is now the second time he's done this...possibly it could be even more times than you and his ex...who knows.  What is sounds like to me is that, the only relationship he's committed to is his work...his work is what he loves the most.  You will never be able to compete with that.  And basically, it sounded like you were and the other girl were taking too much time and demanding too much time of him and he was taking it away from his one true love....his work.  <br>  <br>  So he chose work over you.  Sorry to say, i know it hurts, but it's true.  Best thing to do is leave him be, but don't wait around for him.|`|NTC6g8hYaa	Oooh, tough one. See here's the thing. Workaholics want people in their lives, but their work takes them over and thats why this happens. So this is what you do:<br>  A) talk to him about this. Ask him if yall have a future and if he's been seeing anyone. Also ask him if there is another reason why he needs a break.<br>  B) tell him you love him! Tell him how much he means to you and that you dont want things to end or go down the wrong path. Reassure him that yall will always be friends but you really want to be with him right now.<br>  C) make sure he's still "faithful", ask his friends or something, but in an open, not sneaky manner.<br>  D) keep talking to him about this and dont let go, see him as you normally would. The only thing is that you need to give him enough space to figure things out. But seeing you and you reminding him of the times being together will make him want you even more.<br>  <br>  So, follow these steps and dont give up, he does love you!<br>  Good luck :)|`|xG04jzOEaa	It sounds like he's overwhelmed...and maybe like he's not ready for a relationship.  I don't think he's being completely honest with you.  And if it is a break...what has to change before he's willing to be with you.  How much of your life are you willing to waste waiting around for this guy?|`|R8YvSEdPaa	that guy is very lost indeed. If u really like him stay with him help him go through this hard time, if you think that he isnt worth it because of all the stress and how he's been reacting get over it there will be nicer guys.|`|8mLuWhzhaa	If he says he loves you and wants to be with you it probaly is a break not a break up.|`|jsq3M6P3aa	go with what your heart says none of us know this guy only you do so follow your heart and do what you thinks best|`|IDpHJ5Ubaa	i dnt know  srry|`|18vHHaBQaa	I hate to sound like a book or a movie, but you need to hear it.  He's probably just not that into you.  <br>  <br>  Here's a couple truths.  If a guy wants to date you, he will. Nothing about work or previous relationships will generally change that.  Only exception would be if he just broke up with an Ex, within a month or so depending on how long they dated.  Even that is stretching.<br>   <br>  So you may ask if he wanted to just break it off, why all the love talk and Facebook and what not?  Well, breaking up with somebody you care about is hard to do.  Many people try and make it easier by calling it a break, not a break up.  They think that by doing it in stages, you won't feel as bad, and by extension make them feel less shitty about breaking up with you.<br>  <br>  The key is, you should be with somebody who really wants to be with you.  And maybe if you cut this guy off completely for awhile (and I mean 100% cut off- no texting or making out or whatever is age-appropriate) he might realize how much he misses you. If he doesn't, go find somebody who does.|`|6gCthN8taa	Sounds to me like he is probably just needing his own space at the moment.  I wouldn't stress over it too much.  Seems like he is just asking for a break.  If this were one of my buddies, I would probably assume he needs a weekend just chilling w/ his guy friends.   Treat it like a break (that's not a bad thing).  Give him a little space, and don't stress.  Stress is contagious.  Don't bug him for a day or two, and let things just sit and air out for a few.  Keep a positive attitude, and that will benefit you both.  As far as why?  Who knows... worst case, there is an issue he isn't prepared to share....Probably the the real issue, is just something stupid, like needing to chill w/ friends or go paint-balling or something.  I don't know, he may not know even, but it's probably nothing to stress over.  Please excuse my crappy punctuation, and good luck to you.  Keep on a smile.|`|Ri8Cbi1caa	Ok, you need to tell him how you feel.  He may be under a lot of stress, but you have feelings too.  If he "believes" he loves you then he will make time for you.  Tell, him how you feel, and if nothing changes then you have to move on.  If he does try to give you more time, then maybe he does love you, but he actually does have more than what he can handle at the moment.  However, remember that if he can't make time for you, any time, you have to move on.  If you don't you will become more confused and agitated.|`|j8RXDfn5aa	You have to ask HIM the right questions - to be able to choose what you want to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is this a "break" or are we breaking things off?<br>  <br>  How much time do you need to get your life in order?<br>  <br>  What do you want from me? <br>  <br>  What do you expect me to do while you're fixing you?<br>  Do you want me to wait for you? Etc. <br>  <br>  I have to tell you, it does not sound terribly promising by what you wrote... So, you NEED to know exactly what you are dealing with<br>  <br>   & remember:        There are no victims.... Only volunteers.|`|uGY1eopqaa	It sounds like he's just not at a place in his life where he can be a good boyfriend. You should steer clear of him for a while to let him figure out what he wants in life. Because honestly, it doesn't sound like he's sure that he loves you. Why waste your time on someone who doesn't know if he loves you? I'm sure there's a guy out there that would love you and make time for you. But he isn't that guy right now, maybe he could be some day, but it seems that he's just too wrapped up in his own thing right now.
sFjzZG4jaa	Well basicly they don't things like, measure your height, maybe make you look at letters and read them, I think they might make you take your shirt off, and measure your spine. Thats all I remember.|`|YQpGSr2Laa	well its not going to be  fun but the worst thing about it is being afraid of it, if you stop worrying about it you will be doing yourself a favor.
WJZPgXzoaa	No paternity has to be established then from that day forward he will be responsible, and if her husband wants to adopt the child which i think would be best in this case he could have his rights terminated.|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Yes, if in cases of unmarried persons paternity has been established.<br>  If paternity is uncertain then it will be required by the court before a petition for child support can be addressed.<br>  Collection of child support for years passed is only possible if there was a valid court order for support relating to the year(s) in question.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Yes and yes (but he might want to take the chance to get to know the kid - if he wants).  <br>  <br>  Example:  My SIL (scumbag) wanted zero from the father of her second child (lied and said she artificially inseminated for $1,500)...but has been down on her luck and took the father to court (child is now 8)...the guy is in jail and all she can do about it is complain that he "owes her" $22,000....Some people!|`|OtKCAeQZaa	No not that I am a wear of|`|I71zSnmcaa	yes i been there unless he can show she never contacted him or told him he had a chiled..<br>  <br>  **** SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	She can from the point she filed, so if it drags out for a couple years, then he will owe from the point she files. And just because he was irresponsible doesn't absolve him of parental rights. Why do people think they can just give up rights just because they don't want to pay support? <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if her husband has legally adopted the child, then she can't get a penny from your husband.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	The mother can file for child support but the courts will back date it only to the point where she filed. At that time paternity will be established. The court does not hold the father responsible for the child before paternity is established. But it sounds to me like this woman has decided to deny her child the knowledge of his birth father and chosen to place another in his stead. Your husband cannot be faulted for not having knowledge that was never given to him.
SXS2Gf72aa	No, I don't. I used to though. Not sexually most often.

Guys do that girls usually don't. We more like imagine our weddings lol. And most girls if they are the good ones don't worry about what you look like as much as how you act.

isBa2H7uaa	I basically had the same exact problem.<br>  When a couple cant be together as often as they liked it cause problems, I'd suggest you let him know exactly how you feel. if you like him alot and wish to have a longer relationship whit him tell him. also, try to bare things out till summer. :)<br>  <br>  but, with me i dated this guy  for two years. we probably alomost broke up 500 hundred times and broke up three times but not for long. If you think that its not going to work out, be selfish and end it before either of you too get hurt.|`|1XtASkE1aa	just talk to him and see how he feels.|`|WU6pTTvCaa	You want to figure out what HE is thinking . . . well at this point YOU have nearly caused the relationship to breakup weather you admit it or not.  The fact that you feel HE does not show you enough that he wants to be with you causes you to be annoying and push him away.  If he says he misses you, then you should trust him at his word and not read more into it since your sabotaging the relationship.|`|TiRhwBFAaa	i hate to say this but it sounds as if he has another g.f maybe not it depends if hes asting suspicious. just dont take everything so personl. i used to and probably still do. try not to! (:|`|6xFOQ5Ngaa	i feel cause you dont see him that much hes sorta iffy about your relationship because if you think about it, its not like you guys are super close. dont keep bugging him about your relationship because f you do want your relationship to work, i wouldnt do that. <br>  <br>  I think he just feels like because you guys dont hang out alot that your starting to lose touch and that he feels that you wants him to work extremely hard at this relationship but in reality you havent even gone out that long so you shouldnt expect that of him.<br>  <br>  instead of asking him just say it more as a comment like, "hey i know we dont see each other alot and i know your probably like ughhh im really iffy about our relationship, but im not trying to pressure you. I just want to be with you and have what we had before we started dating"<br>  <br>  really, your just pressuring him too much. just try to chill out and be less of a worrier|`|xRtrAcoXaa	You 2 don't see each other enough so there's no way to know if you 2 are meant to be.... That's probably what he is wondering..... He probably loves having someone who likes him and want to be with him but he doesn't know if he likes the real (in person) you. Try finding ways to hangout more so you 2 can talk in person and get to know each other. Good luck!<br>  <br>  ---------------------------- LOVE DOCTOR-------------------|`|aW6wR0YZaa	Don't be annoying. If you think that what you might say would annoy him,  try to phrase it into a way that won't be as annoying. It can get somewhat hard, but you just have to try.<br>  Long distant relationships are also kinda hard, too. Most of the time they don't last. So try to stay with him if you really love him. Hang out, laugh, chat, all that jazz.|`|9HWPal8baa	hes being hot n cold. honestly just be like, do you want to stay together or not? im not sure if he wants to break up with you especially if you guys keep tlakingand everyythings normal besides thatt. just ask him. that way theres no second guessing, or guessing what he means, you get a straight answerr.|`|ArHSNXuraa	just ask him...it is hard though because part of you wants to know but the other part of you doesn't b/c it doesn't want to be hurt...if that made sense|`|1I4TuZc7aa	i agree with the first one|`|AA11487637	I don't know if this will help but my ex was acting like this when were together but he was a real piece of work he was cheating on me some wit some little ***** that lived in his town and he was bi so cheated on both of us wit some guy he broke up wot me in a text message new years eve couldn't even call!( watta jerk! to say it kindly!) but he broke up with me cuz i wouldn't have sex with him<br>  The moral of this is do what you think you have to do not what anyone tells you to do|`|Q2DjI1YJaa	If you ask me I would try and find out exactly what he does during the week when you don't see each other.It seems like he's trying to be nice when he's with you,and don't want to hurt your feelings.Its hard when you only see each other on the weekends,it leaves to much room for other temptations to arise.I'm trying to keep it real.It's like long distance relationships,how many do you know that last.Give it some thought I'm not saying that he is doing anything,but sounds like something might have caught his interest,so if you think  he's worth keeping,do alittle asking around.

If he does, keep flirting. He will eventually take the hint.<br>  If he doesn't take the hint and he seems to like it, he may just be shy. So you have two options:<br>  1. Flat out tell him you like him.<br>  2. Just get physical with him.

twWQwax9aa	You have to love and respect your self first. Your parents splitting up is not your fault. You dad will be mad because getting away with cheating probably made him feel good and like he was untouchable. He will blame you because he isn't strong enough to put the blame where is really should be which is on himself.<br>  <br>  You mum's world has just fallen apart. She trusted your dad and he has thrown this back in her face. She is probably feeling pretty worthless and unloved herself right now. She may be blaming you because the person she is really angry at, your dad, isn't there. She will be mad at herself too and is probably spending hours going over any clues she could have seen about the affair. <br>  <br>  It is confusing when a trusted parent does something wrong. Cheating on your girlfriend won't make you feel better and will just make you feel guilty on top of everything else. Maybe you are just thinking about cheating all the time because your dad who would have been your role model did it. <br>  <br>  Let your mum and dad get over their issues but let your mum know that you support her. You have to take care of yourself right now as when your mum stops blaming you she will need you to be strong for her as a divorce is a really hard thing to go through. <br>  <br>  Think calmly about what you want and don't make any rash decisions while you emotions are all over the place. <br>  <br>  Bottling up your emotions isn't good for you, and the strain is showing in the drastic weight loss. You need to talk to someone. You can't deal with everything alone.<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|AA12198711	You have got to love yourself before you can accept it from others.|`|AA10005384	Wow! Dude your going through alot right now! Parents can really suck sometimes. But as for the whole sex thing I hope you are using protection. No babies! That would just put the icing on the cake! Also cheating is never the answere to anything. Just think about how you would feel if your girl cheated on you. Have you tried seeing if maybe you could go stay with a friend or relative until this all blows over? Your mom should eventually snap out of it and come to her senses. Hope it all works out for you!|`|PC48Zjnjaa	first of all I'm sorry for all you have been through with your parents. That must really suck.

QKpu62oUaa	Hey , I'm sure she is just doing this incase something happens with you and him. She is still making it so you are a part of the wedding and be happy for this. means she likes you and wants you to be apart of this happy day for her. But in case something happened to your relationship your boyfriend wouldn't have to replace you. Don't take it personaly :) and ust have fun.|`|crxbob5jaa	He is her sister and should be in the wedding. You are a girlfriend; not exactly family. She has her friends as her attendants, not her brother's girlfriends. She is completely normal. <br>  <br>  That she would ask you to be the guest book attendant is to be respected. She obviously likes you to ask you to help. Your boyfriend was the rude one to ask such a question, and even more rude to ask in front of you. Or maybe he's just clueless. Let's hope it's the later.|`|7e632a04dd178e071e54add9fb9eb945aa	No matter how you feel, you should not show it right now.  The important thing is her wedding. If you do have a future with this guy, it's nice to put the sister's wedding first - at least for now.<br>  <br>  This comment is rude, but it is not a huge deal.  It's the kind of comment that well adjusted people will look back on and laugh about... "remember when you made me be a guest book attendant because you didn't know if I'd be around for the wedding?" <br>  <br>  I can't tell you how you "should" feel - because feelings come from within.  I can suggest what you could do though.<br>  <br>  You should thank her for making you part of the family's special occasion, and tell her that you appreciate being included.  When you get to know her, and after her wedding, you could talk honestly about your feelings. <br>  <br>  Great question and good luck!|`|hsZnjZvoaa	The couple getting married's siblings/friends should be their attendants.  It's not who is 'marching' with the attendants.   Dating someone should not automatically secure you a place in the wedding party.  It would, however have been rude not to invite you the the wedding (or allow you to go as his guest).  I think you should be appreciative that she is including you.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Don't take any of this as mean. I'm jsut making a statement. lol She isn't obligated to let you have any part of it. The bridesmaids are supposed to be her closest friends. Now if you were married it might be a different story. I have a couple in my wedding party and they aren't even walking together. One is the maid of honor and one is just a groomsmen. we can't change the BM just so they can walk together. It's not about you..it's about her and her husband.|`|QdCwBSVQaa	When you are his "wife" and not his girlfriend, then you can complain about the slight.  Until then, you are not a member of the family - just a cherished friend.  Be a gracious guest, and enjoy yourself.  Your turn will come soon enough, and on your wedding day, your new in-laws will remember how classy and sweet you were at this sister's wedding.|`|U5TDVhBFaa	well, you should be grateful she included/invited you to her wedding. If her brother has a history of many short term relationships-then she shouldn't have to ruin her wedding to accomodate you-( who is possibly,another one of his many girls)<br>  <br>  try changing your shoes and think about your wedding day- would you want your wedding ruined/extra stress of finding replacing your brothers ex girlfriend? I feel she is being realistic,and you should respect that|`|sCDiWPq4aa	I am with the bride on this one. You are not your boyfriends fiance and you aren't married to him so your importance here is...none. I would simply say "thank you" and do your duty. When you get married you will have your own decisions to make and you might decide to make her the guest book attendant.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I think your bf was rude to put his sister on the spot and ask what your roll in her wedding will be.  The fact that she did not ask you before now to be in the wedding probably means she wasn't going to consider having you in the wedding before he mentioned it.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Be gracious and accept.  She was very blunt and honest.  It was generous of her to offer a spot for you.  Usually, girlfriends/boyfriends are not invited to weddings unless the couple is serious with one another.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	The sister is right. You're not part of the family. <br>  That being said, I hate those stupid jobs like guest book attendant and gift attendant. I think people know how to sign a guestbook.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	You're supposed to feel thankful that she even asked you to participate in the wedding.  My husband has been in several weddings since we've been married and I've never gotten to walk with him.  That's because the bride and I weren't close enough for me to be in the wedding.  So I politely enjoy the wedding from the pew.  My sister-in-law is getting married this summer and she and I are close enough for her to ask me to be in the wedding so for the first time my husband and I will walk together in a wedding.  For my wedding, we had multiple couples in the bridal party.  But we had them paired based on height, not dating status.  So none of the four couples in our wedding got to walk with their significant other.  It's really not that big of a deal.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Get over it. Your bf's sister is not obligated to put you in the wedding - you are not a family member or one of her close friends. Her brother (your bf) will walk down the aisle with one of the bridesmaids - that woman won't be his date, she'll be an attendant of the bride. The fact that she's given you any part in the wedding is extremely generous.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I think your bf's sister is right.  Most bridesmaids do not get to march with their bf's and visa versa in weddings.  When I was in my cousin's wedding, I marched with the groom's brother instead of my bf!  The groom's bro was engaged at the time and he was told to march with me, not his fiancee!  You have to respect the couple and do as they wish.  I think it is unusual that she would even ask you to be the guest book attendant!|`|P3e2kJtwaa	It's her wedding, and unless you guys have been together for a long time, I'd make the same call.  My wedding is on a budget, so my friends aren't even bringing dates unless they've been together for a year or longer (or they're married) and they respect that decision, just as you should respect the bride's decision.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	March with him? You mean like be a bridesmaid? Unless you two are best friends, thats not necessarily appropriate. She picks her friends. Besides, i would be weary of that too unless you two have been together for several years. I would be honored she wants to you help at all to be honest. Sorry if you think it is rude :-/|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	It's not rude at all. He was asked to be groomsman because he is her brother.<br>  It was nice that she asked you to participate at all.|`|p9t0Xpm3aa	I think unless you and his sister are close, you shouldn't be in the wedding. Definitely not march in with him. I had been with my boyfriend for a year and a half when his sister got married and I was not in her wedding. However, I helped out the entire weekend with set-up of the wedding site, making sure the guests were where they were supposed to be, set-up of the reception and cutting/ serving of the cake! Be there, be happy with the job she's given you and be helpful and available whenever they need you! They will love you for it! My then boyfriend is my now husband and his family still talks about how wonderful I was at her wedding almost two years later!|`|DrzuDOD6aa	While she said it in a rude way, she has a very good point. You can be upset all you want, but in the end, it's her wedding and weddings are all about the bride and groom. If that's the way she wants it, then you have to respect that. Besides, who knows if you will be together by that time (not to be rude, just stating). At least she asked you to do the guest book. She didn't have to ask you to be involved at all.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	First of all: The sister has done nothing wrong by having her brother not walk with you. Heck my sisters are married, but that doesnt mean their husbands were in the wedding. My sisters walked with the groomsmen, who both are married as well. This is not about you or your relationship.<br>  <br>  Second: It was incredibly rude of your boyfriend to put his sister on the spot like that, especially since she hasnt done anything wrong. How do you usually respond when someone puts you on the spot? She said the first thing that came to her mind.<br>  <br>  It should only bother you if you are insecure about your relationship. What she thinks about you two is insignificant. Do YOU think youll be still be together by the time the wedding rolls around?|`|AA10018260	It is her wedding....so she is the one to make the decisions.  If you are not real close with her then I can understand why she wouldn't ask you to march with him.  My best friend is my bridesmaid but I didn't ask her bf to be in the wedding.  I don't know him very well....AND if they DO break up then I have an important piece of my wedding missing.  She is not being rude....she is still including u in the wedding.|`|w1necKzYaa	You have a right to be mad at what she said but it is her wedding and she is probably right! how long have you been together?  you are just lucky that she is not making him march with an ex or something like that! IT IS HER WEDDING!!! you are lucky she asked you to do anything!|`|QzWHMGHJaa	you're lucky to have been asked to be in it at all, what she said was the truth, there is nothing to feel or do, other than say yes to being the book attendant or not!|`|G1boIrFuaa	I agree.  The bridesmaids are supposed to be HER friends, not her brother's girlfriend.  You should feel glad that she wants you to be a part of her day, no matter how small the part.|`|GvamTVqAaa	That it's her wedding and you are just his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  This really shouldn't offend you.  It would be quite awkward if something were to happen and there's always a possibility..
KaF0nNFmaa	That's a little sad.  To be honest when I become a mother I won't think that pornography will ruin my son.  How many boys have watched porn before their 18th birthday?  Tons!  Your fathers, uncles, cousins, brothers have probably all have seen pornography before legal age.<br>  <br>  I think it's a better alternative for a boy than going out and having sex.  People need to grow up and think a little more objectively.|`|AA12198711	Be grateful just a little that she cares enough to let you know she cares.|`|qjf1BoNIaa	Hmm...yeah well chances are she knows you are looking at it. It is pretty easy to figure out. What you need to do is tell her she can install whatever program she wants to the computer to keep the porn off then she will be happy. They have software that will show her where you have been. Sorry but that's the only way. You then just need to get your porn elsewhere. Magazines or DVD's until you are 18. As long as she thinks you have access to it on your computer she will obsess and obsess and obsess....you will never convince her you are not doing it.|`|qFbx2nuFaa	Tell her to mind her own business lol<br>  And if she feels like you're doing something wrong - to tighten up the secuirty features on the computer!|`|3U7WTuXraa	Tell her that it is awfully hurful that she does not trust you. Exaggerate a little, afterall you are saying the truth.|`|qnU1HS1aaa	Your mom is crazy
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	She doesn't own the venue so I don't see what the problem is. Lots of people get married in the same place.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	You don't have to ask her if you can use the same location because she doesn't own the place and has no control over your wedding plans.  What you might want to think about is whether or not many of your guests will also be attending her wedding.  If so, you might want to seriously reconsider that location.  The guests might think you were trying to copy her rather than realizing that you liked it just as much as she did.  Look for another place just like it.  On the other hand, if you don't have many of the same guests, go right ahead and have it at the same place.  Just make sure you decorate differently and make it your own.|`|QdCwBSVQaa	Does she own the venue?  No?  Then you don't need her permission.<br>  <br>  The reality is, there are a finite number of nice places where a wedding/reception can be held.  You don't get a monopoly into perpetuity simply because you have a wedding at a particular venue.   <br>  <br>  Your friend isn't much of a friend if she thinks you should ask her "permission."  The reality is, your guest lists probably won't overlap much, and it's going to be a totally different bunch of people experiencing the wedding.  Unless you're planning to use the same colors, flowers, music, and food, it won't even seem like the same place.|`|7CKipTZOaa	As long as you aren't doing the same colors and centerpieces this shouldn't be an issue, if she is your best friend it shouldn't be an issue with her but it is thoughtful to let her know your intentions|`|PGx3uPrSaa	no if you really like it but you may want to look for something your self. Keeplooking first you may find something better|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	No. She doesnt have exclusive rights to any venue. She should take it as a compliment!|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	I was in the same boat. When our friends announced their engagement I told the bride-to-be about this place that I was in love with. I was still dating (my now fiance) and so the place was all hers. <br>  <br>  She had a lovely wedding and when it came time for us picking the location for our wedding I couldn't even consider the location. My friend insisted, but in the end I couldn't do it. <br>  <br>  My friend had an unlimited budget supplied by her parents, and we're paying for our own wedding. Even though the venue has 8 different locations for the ceremony and reception, I didn't want to take away from either of our special days so I just picked a whole different location. <br>  <br>  It was hard at first but I found a venue that is absolutely perfect for us! Plus, my friend now says that if she had seen our location when she was getting married, she would have picked it. <br>  <br>  Everything will work out in the end.|`|2rCZbaEIaa	don't even ask....just tell her, I love yours so much Im doing mine there!    Your weddings are months apart, good reception halls are hard to find, and you will probably have different colors and things and do you really think someone (other than your best friend) is really going to compare the weddings?<br>  <br>  I say go for it, im actually SUGGESTING my venue to my friends, it was classy and inexpensive and I want all my friends to be able to afford a beautiful wedding as well.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Is it a public place?  Or her house?  She's not running your wedding, you are.  Even if you picked the same place, the decoration and all that jazz will not be the same.  Anyways, you may feel differently when you are actually there for her wedding.  I hope you're not disappointed (with service, etc.)|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Do you have a lot of guests that would attend both weddings? That might be a little weird. <br>  It's only a venue. It's not like you're taking over her wedding day. She gets one day, not a month or a year.|`|CQsD09D6aa	Why do you have to ask her anything? It is up to the owners of the place. If they say the place  is available and you are prepared to pay their price then it's yours!
N7gOE1btaa	My husband BOUGHT some properties before OUR MARRIAGE and some after OUR MARRIAGE.  I would like to know if I divorce HIM, WILL the properties BE divide equally or not?<br>  Can someone PLEASE help me?  I live in Massachusetts.<br>  <br>  You sound like a gold-digger, do you really feel entitled to something he bought before your marriage?  I bet he bought you things before the marriage too, do you think he should get half of that back?|`|AuKKjaxaaa	As winging it suggested, properties that were purchased while your finances were combined are on the table for a divorce settlement.  The previously owned properties are not likely to be.|`|19ea0ffe56f1755c71f275c227e7fe16aa	most likely the properties owned prior to marriage will not be subject to the divorce like the properties acquired during the marriage.|`|vk3dKR3Caa	Most likely the properties that was brough before the marriages will remain with him the properties brought afterwards will be divided or sold. equally
JYgJD0Rwaa	MA is not a community property state (community property states require all assets & debts be split 50/50 during a divorce) so the assets/properties will be divided by the court if you two cannot come to an agreement as to whom gets what in the divorce.|`|eWObKmBSaa	It is the law, divorce all things are divided, even the bills. <br>  But hey, get a counselor and keep everything plus him or her.
P3e2kJtwaa	No, they ask you if you want to include that in the ceremony, and it is a sweet part, the symbolism is beautiful, but it's not necessary.  My hubby and I did choose to have the rings when we got married by JP in October, and we're doing an actual ceremony this June|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Wedding rings are never required.  You don't even have to wear them.  So no, it isn't necessary to have them at the wedding.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It's not required by law, if this is what you're asking. It's just a tradition.|`|4lL34wJnaa	All that is required is that you get your license and if your state requires it, you have a witness...  No where does it state that anyone needs a wedding band.  If you don't want one or at least don't want one now, it's ok!|`|LCAzlHhEaa	There is no law that says when you get married you have to have rings.  But in a typical church wedding you have them so the rings get blessed by the officiant.|`|BXz2cyAzaa	No|`|hsZnjZvoaa	If you're here in the states, rings are not necessary.  However once you're married (after the JP) you can wear them; or you can have them at your real/actual wedding and take them off for the vow renewal ceremony in October (you will be legally married so actually October isn't a 'wedding'.  Hopefully your guests will know that you're already married - otherwise that's dishonest and as a guest I'd be offended.)<br>  <br>  If you're not in the states and a civil wedding and church wedding are the norm, please don't be offended.|`|Tk51uq33aa	No, the ring is just a symbol of marriage.<br>  <br>  You need it in a church ceremony (it signifies the eternity of marriage), but a JOP doesn't require one.<br>  <br>  I know some people that got matching tattoos instead of wedding rings, and if that's ok, I'm sure you don't need rings with the JOP.<br>  <br>  Congratulations by the way!!!|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Nope.  It's up to the couple.
aDL7xmt6aa	You should be able to heat for less then $200 per mo. on an annual average and you should seriously consider ditching the phone/cable/internet and take better care of your children.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You should be fine.  Are you sure food is only $300 though?|`|f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	Could you live off of $600 after everything is paid.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Is that net or gross?  The total is 1300 and you havn't figured in medical or clothing for your family?  Then there is eating out sometimes, and fun activities, family night out.  YOu figure in those too.|`|jabjwLfnaa	Absolutely not... unless you can cut the cable bill to $45 and the electricity to about $60.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	I don't think so as long as you don't go to crazy with the rest of your money left over.  Spend wisely.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Is the $1970 before or after taxes?  If after, I would say you should be okay... maybe could cut back on the cable a bit.  <br>  <br>  If it's before taxes, then I would definitely cut back on the cable and do what you can to keep the electric down and maybe look for bargains at the supermarket.  I don't think $630 is unreasonable for rent.   <br>  <br>  You could probably get DSL and cell cheaper.  I think you should look into all options.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	670 left for health insurance, food, clothes, school supplies, school lunches, entertainment, gas, car payment, car insurance, nah you should be good to go.....|`|gkocAbnVaa	1970<br>                                                             --   630  <br>                                                                 200<br>                                                                 170                        <br>                                                                 300<br>                                                             (=670$)left                                                                  ur answer would be by Calculator ur answer would be yes of ud dobne that ud still have (670$) left so that would be a good start|`|ze7xiJwTaa	$170 for cable???? WTF???
1HLPznZhaa	We all have faults..This may be one of hers.. I suspect she is insecure and really doesn't know what to say so she kind of embellishs her conversation as she goes along.. If you really find this annoying then by all means discuss this with her.. but try not to be too critical.. It's all a part of growing up..|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, it happened to me as well, if this is not the first time, then you may want to end your friendship with her because you don't want friends who constantly lie to you behind your back.|`|HmnAjfINaa	i do it the hesitatin bit if im mentionin somethin i did i stammer as i try an remember what actually happened coz i have a memory like a goldfish lol bt yer just let her get on with it if it isnt case any harm to anyone then it doesnt matter :) x|`|9UQlhzitaa	in the work world we call them types (one uppers) no mater what you have done they have done it better or make it seem like what yo did is not important because they have already done it.<br>  <br>  The way to not lose all of them is next time she starts telling stories start asking those type of questions and she will trip herself up in time<br>  good luck to you|`|TkOgBCaIaa	yes this happen to me too..my friend well my other friends say she lies alot and idk but i think she lies when she tells me stuff so...if you think she is still lying, go talk to her about it or just end the friendship cause i don't want someone telling me lies o.O|`|gytWvw30aa	maybe she has a hard time opening up. the next time she says something that seems untrue confront her about it. tell her its okay to express herself around you. make sure its clear to her that lying can ruin your friendship. good luck =]|`|w0QMQqHFaa	Ya it's happened to me, maybe she's not comfortable around you <br>  Maybe she just likes to lie, some people do, i wouldn't hang around those people because sometimes it just goes to far and you'll probably just get caught in the middle
DrzuDOD6aa	This seems to be a big issue these days. I'm old fashioned. I think you need to talk with him about this now. If you don't feel comfortable talking about it now, then when will you? Just let him know that just so he knows, you don't want to live together before you are married, it's not what you believe. If he doesn't respect that or want that, then maybe you 2 aren't as compatable as you thought. Good luck|`|5jMNBO2naa	yes he very might never propose<br>  and that will eliminate him as a potential spouse won't it?<br>  you should know those who move in together ( called shacking up ) before marriage divorce at a much higher rate than those who do not<br>  and then there is a the stat of those who move in may never get proposed to<br>  since they are in free preview mode<br>  <br>  once you move in<br>  you give away all his logic and reason to even propose to you since he is in free preview mode|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Not necessarily. The good thing about this is that you get to know each other as much as you think you know him you don't really know him until you move in with him no matter what you think. Anyways just bring up the subject and come to an agreement.|`|498JdszFaa	Now.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	I would do what feels right to you.  If he brings it up, you should be able to talk with him about it.  If moving in with him is the only way he will propose, then I would really think about this relationship.  <br>  <br>  Some people would rather live separately until married and there is nothing wrong with this.  You have to be true to yourself.<br>  <br>  If he does propose and you still wish to live separately until married, you will need to discuss before marriage, who is giving up their home.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	You are correct, do not move in and play house. He wants to have all the benefits of marriage without the commitment. Stand your ground, if he want to live with you for ever then he will step up to the plate. Do not let his family pressure you to do what will make you unhappy and uncomfortable.|`|0u9WdWb7aa	tell him now! It will save Both of you time! IT IS NEVER GOOD TO HIDE FEELINGS ABOUT ANYTHING. LIKE THAT ITS CLEAR. If you dont want TO , then just dont. Plus if  his fam did that , that was HIS FAM. <br>  nO COMITMENT IS AN EASY WAY OUT OF A RLATIONSHIP IN THE FUTURE, PLUS IF HE WANTS TO BUILD A FAMILY WHAT WRONG WITH MARRIAGE? <br>  DONT GIVE IN GIRL BECUASE OF YOU DO, IWANT YOU TO THINK BACK ON THESE WORD " I TOLD YOU SO".|`|RcpRW202aa	you would try on a pair of shoes before buying them right? why would you not move in with the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. that is how you truly get to know someone cuz their is nothing for them to hide.<br>  <br>  if your not moving in with him due to religious reasons, take a look at Jessica Simpson she waited to move in with Nick and they ended up getting a divorce anyways.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	This is your belief, not to live together before marriage. And if he can't live with this decision, Than I guess he isn't right for you. Just give him some time, Did he say your not getting engaged? Or your just assuming so?|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Do not do anything that makes you uncomfortable. If you do not want to live with him. Then Don't.If he mentions it then tell him truthfully how you feel. If he loves you he will respect your decision|`|mCM363I9aa	yes, let him know that's not the way you want to go<br>  He should understand and if he doesn't to hell with him|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You need to be honest with him. If he's talking about moving in together and you're silent, he will assume that you have no objections and that this is where the relationship is going. If you know you will never consider it, voice your concerns now. Then you both can discuss your views and your plan of action.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	I would just plainly say that living together before marriage goes against my principals and that you will not change your opinion no matter what. If he takes off because of that, it wasn't meant to be.
mXkv62vYaa	keep cool,this guy is trying to get to your feelings,dont let him break you.have fun,be happy,you only live once,make the most of it.try watching some comedy,and let your hair down,you will feel much better,this guy wont get a second thought,he will be history.|`|JF0SIngqaa	It sounds like he just needed an excuse to get a new girlfriend. He used you to do this. I would not stay in contact with him after the way he has been treating you. He gets a rush out of this and I wouldn't let him have the pleasure. Don't talk to him or even have any contact with him. You will get over him in time. LIfe is to short to be miserable.|`|S2ZhjdUyaa	Cry all you want darling because he is a jerk. You might think he's the one for you (and he might be) but from what I know, he is a retard. Go outside, party, and get over him and if you can't well call him and tell him he is wrong about you and about everything.|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	sounds like he already had someone else when he broke up with you and since he wasn't man enough to tell you it's what he really wanted he decided to blame you so he could wash his hands...get over this loser...no reason wh he should have called you to let you know he was with someone and happy...move on and next time he calls even if you dont, tell him you have someone whos incredible and thank him for breaking up with you otherwise you wouldnt have met this new guy...and cut it short..........good luck,,,hes not worth it|`|egpVC6uMaa	Don't call him...he has a hold on you and he called to confirm that he still has that upper hand in your relationship. If you call him, you will confirm that he still has a very strong hold on you and you really haven't moved on.<br>  <br>  It's hard to get over someone we love but sometimes it is better...in this situation, he sounds like an immature creep that will do nothing but continue to cause you heart ache.<br>  <br>  Let it go..try to put him out of your mind. He isn't worth it.<br>  Good Luck.|`|uJU7jGtHaa	when i was younger before i met my husband i was going out with this lad who treated me like a queen for about 3 months, taking me places, telling me he loved me etc. i was so inlove with him. i was going through a bad boy stage i think and he was a boxer with a nice car and nice body lol. anyway after the 3 months or so we had an arguement becuase he had never told me he had 2 children and i found out through a freind. we aparently sorted it out over the phone. and then he disapeared!! i didnt see him for like 4 months, i was so upset and all i thought about was him. i literally thought he was going to ring me all the time, everytime my phone rang i thought it would be him... then one night at 4am he turned up outside my house beeping his car and knocking on my door! i talked to him but i never got back with him as much as i wanted to i just knew in the end it would not work so why prolong anything?? even if you got back together do you really want to just wait to go through it again when you argue again??<br>  the only one who can give you answers is him im afraid and sorry for wittering on lol<br>  <br>  just keep socialising etc and you will meet someone else and forget all about this one, he sounds like he wants to play mind games! xx|`|fLU63N4kaa	Okay, read your question again, to get an outside perspective, then I advise you should:<br>  <br>  Do whatever the hell you want. And live with the decision, you'll be better and stronger afterwards. Don't let anyone make your decisions for you. C'mon girl, you're better than that. Be independant, live your life.<br>  <br>  And listen to this song: 'Waiting for my real life to begin' by Colin Hay, it's beautiful. Please do, you won't regret it.|`|g0YNQdL2aa	why prolong ther heartache?, try to forget about him for your own sake.|`|Y96keyEiaa	I don't know, I'm sorry.|`|DFWvjolMaa	You've got over it once and I'm sure you can get over it again if you can find the strength inside yourself. By getting on with your life, you've shown that you are far more mature than him and it has only highlighted his need to play mind games with you.<br>  <br>  There probably isn't going to be any resolution if you phone him. It's unfortunate, I know and like me, you probably like to have clear closure on things like this but you may just have to grin and bear it. It will only end up going round in circles if you don't. <br>  <br>  I hope you can find it in yourself to move on again. If he calls again, don't answer because he'll just drag you right back down again.

I immediately apologized and said it would never happen again and it never did.  I pushed, not punched.  Open hand.  She was standing with her back to the bed and just sort of fell  back/sat back onto the bed.  No pain.  No injury.  Still not acceptable for either of us.

3U7WTuXraa	honestly, dude, often people complain about not having any friends. I don't see your dilemma. And maybe it's because they're dumbassess because if their friendship is unapreciated why waste  time. Popularity and all  its **** does not matter in life and it's ridiculous seeing tools act as if it did.|`|OwfoyXpraa	What's wrong with having more friends?<br>  It won't kill you.<br>  Maybe it's because they like being around you and they want to be your friend?

In the end, her feelings will be hurt if she likes you a lot.<br>  just slowly start seperating from her. less talking, less looking at her, less of everything you did to make her attracted to you. unless your like super hot then shed always be attracted.<br>  lol hope i helped a little.|`|Io1GLhJ6aa	if i were you i would make sure that your not leading her on in n/e way<br>  then just sit down and talk to her and tell her that you know that she really likes you and that you think it's not fair to keep her guessing and that you don't like her like that <br>  <br>  and it may be really hard for her to deal with but she needs to know and you could tell her that if somethings meant to be then it will happen and that she'll find someone <br>  <br>  then say sorry because we all know that it would make you sound like a jerk if you didn't...not that you are because you probably aren't if you care enough to ask how to let her down easy|`|vYeS5mYnaa	how kind of u to care. just let her know. if she's really into u, she might not want to catch on to a hint. be clear and tell her straight but let her know that u dont want her to be hurt.|`|g7gvzhkpaa	I'm just not that into to you

OLu5iiJHaa	Sounds like you're just having a bit of a communication issue. You want to talk to your parents about being friends with a guy because of their conservative views. The guy thinks that you see him as more than a friend. Maybe apologize first for bringing up the subject in a confusing manner, than reassure him that your parents are a bit more conservative than others and they like to know who you're hanging around with (girl or guy, friend or more) and then bring up the idea of meeting them in a very neutral setting.

StQh7RN6aa	omg totally similar situation with my bf and i. same age and first relationship also. but we have been going out longer and have done more but also were kinda slow starters for physical stuff i guess. <br>  a lot of people think it is much much better to not rush into some of the physical stuff because it makes it more special when you finally do. as for hugging, well u should just hug him good bye or something asap-even friends do that. u might just have to take the initiative tho. i know that from experience because my bf also is on the shy side. but hugging is not a big deal. kissing, there is no rush. just wait until you are both ready and the timing is right. there has to be some time when you start being closer, and u would rather it be sooner than later right? just start out slow and things will progress!<br>  good luck girl :)|`|yd4bTuWOaa	Its normal to feel shy when i was young in my first relationship we tried everything to avoid eachother. youre very young but when youre ready its nice to remember your first kiss make it cute fast and special!|`|OhcsdKYLaa	no its not weird at all. My friend went out with her boyfriend (at the time they were both 14 and now have been going out for 5 years!) and it took them 3 months to kiss! Both were very shy of course.

I think its cute and sweet that you havent yet. <br>  Just go on some little romantic dates and if it feels right then go with the flow.|`|RNdowYxeaa	This is so natural.

fqVxw8HMaa	its really nice to hear that someone actually wants to get help for themselves first. thats great, i really hope you do well and i hope you can be supportive to your sister.<br>  thats very nice.<br>  <br>  - you just need to stop 'violence' and most importantly don't say things or use language to make her feel upset. you are responsible for these actions which would impact on the other person.|`|qqLcvDDKaa	Just try to be the one who makes her feel better whenever she feels sad or bullied. Because family are supposed to be there for each other no matter what. If she acts nasty towards you then just ignore her, when she gets older hopefully she will stop and mature. Just try to keep her by your side.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	How about taking her for a long walk in the woods and then leaving her there?<br>  No more little sister so no more being nasty to her.<br>  Ja.|`|dCPH9pGgaa	You really need to be nice to her, you are the one she probably wants to look up to, and to see you bullying her will make her think it's ok for people at school to treat her like that.<br>  <br>  If you are angry at her, just leave the room. Don't let her annoy you, try to change the way the situation flows :)<br>  When I was younger my older sister looked after me, and now we are the best of friends, inseparable!<br>  <br>  Try to do different things with her, like taking her shopping or something. I have little brothers and know how annoying they can be, but really do appreciate that you can help your sister out, try and be there for her and set an example :)<br>  <br>  I sound like a mother or something!! :)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps..|`|59UwHzITaa	Just refrain from getting into fights and 'cussing' fights with her.<br>  If you do some how manage to get into one, just don't retaliate, the vast majority of the time, if you walk away, the other person will stop.<br>  <br>  I hope this was useful.|`|x2J2EQoBaa	Ask her how she feels about it and try to put yourself in her situation.|`|547cda86a737eee48c045921b9b5afa1aa	its normal to fight with your siblings just remember you are older and should know better.i bet you wouldnt swap her for the world really|`|bvgQV9lMaa	How sad....how would you feel if one day she wasn't there anymore?<br>  Wouldn't you miss her?<br>  <br>  She is chubby and gets bullied at school and bullied at home by you!<br>  How would you feel if you were her?<br>  <br>  If you started acting like a caring big sister then eventually she would stop having to lash out at you.  <br>  When you fight, argue and make fun of her you are teaching her to do the same to you.<br>  <br>  Tell her you dont want to fight anymore, that you want to be friends and have fun times together.<br>  Try giving her little presents and tell her its because you love her.<br>  Even though she is younger have a girly evenings, face masks, washing each others hair, ect. Tell her how lovely she looks.<br>  Take her out with you sometimes.<br>  <br>  Talk to your Mum or another adult about it.
yyMtdbCmaa	If you really want to be noticed just get focus on all the thing you wrote. Try to change them. My dad used to tell me I need to stop being so nice or I am just gonna get walked on. I suggest try to stand out a little more. Don't let yourself be forgotten! If someone ignores you then either speak louder or just start laughing to yourself. They might think its out of character and be more interested in you.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You may want to talk to your friends about it because it seems that they are not making an effort and value your friendship.  If this is not the first time after you talked to them, you may want to find group of friends who appreciates for who you are.|`|IkyVY3C0aa	i can sorta relate i know this person and ill be talking to them and the next thing you know they just tune me out like i was never talking to them but its good to be a quiet person i mean like they don't notice the good things you do but i bet if you do something bad they are going to remember it was you but im not saying do something bad.
GzB6BIqbaa	The best way to get over three years together is talk to your closer friends. Express how you feel, and let out everything that needs to be let out.<br>  <br>  Stay with your friends a lot more. Hang out with them, talk with them, do fun stuff with them!<br>  <br>  You should also listen to upbeat music which you enjoy. Music loosens up the mind, and so you should give it a try, and see what happens.<br>  <br>  You should spend more quality time with your family and beloved ones. This will get your mind off the thoughts of the recent break up. Your family should be welcoming, as they are the ones that are most close to you.<br>  <br>  If you have any pets, play with them. They bring in so much entertainment in ones life. They loosen up the soul, and let your mind wander into a playful atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Last, smile, laugh, and live life to its fullest! Do something you have never tried yet. Explore, relax, play an instrument. Maybe even draw a portrait, paint, or do some photographing. Anything fun is suitable for a hard break up.<br>  <br>  Remember those few last words I mentioned! Smile, laugh, and live life to its fullest. Cherish your life, you only live once!<br>  <br>  I hope this helped you tremendously, and take care!|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I'm no expert, but I suggest that to get over someone you need to spend lots of time with friends.  Being with friends reminds you how much your company is desired by others, rather than sitting alone wondering why you weren't enough for him.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	Talk to me in May because right now there is NO way to begin the healing process while you are both under the same roof.<br>  <br>  Sad but true.|`|GhML3DyIaa	Well don't spend too much time moping after all he's the one who said he wants to experiment so therefore doesn't merit your thinking time. You will regret it if you go into yourself and you owe it to yourself to get over him as soon as possible.<br>  When you feel upset think of him wanting to meet other people and how he doesn't deserve your upset.<br>  When you feel upset that he is actually thinking this way then know that he mustn't have been right for you if he doesn't feel commited enough to see you exclusively.<br>  I was with someone three years myself and I got over it by meeting up with an old pal and getting out as much as possible.|`|gZdKOms8aa	Meet somebody new.

VKRmIj6Gaa	What am I supposed to do after having a really bad day?<br>  >>>I think I've used this quote a thousand times before if not I'm getting pretty close to a thousand. <br>  <br>  “I know it seems hard sometimes but remember one thing. <br>  Through every dark night, theres a bright day after that. <br>  So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out, keep ya head up.... and handle it.”<br>  -Tupac Shakur (2pac)<br>  <br>  I know it seems like something you probably don't wanna hear ...AGAIN! lol but its so true.. The longer you ponder on your bad day the worse you feel... So, be tough forget about it... don't give up don't give in, deal with it. Dont believe what anyone else says about you unless it is absolutely true and whoever said that needing help on things is a bad thing? Your bro might just be frustrated.. When I talk to you I don't see a selfish or arrogant spoiled person, but you know you better than I know you so if those things are true then don't let it get you down... do somethin about it iight? You don't have to be that way. People CAN change and I'm a livin witness... I think I told you my story... or was that just Sasu? o.O... I think I told you about the gang stuff and my bro and all that... Yeah look at me now and how much I've changed.. I've gone through some stuff and thought some things that you would read and be like .. "Whoa, this dude is nuts" lol but I made a change so you can too... I really don't think you need one though.. I like you the way you are when I chat with you! I don't think it is necessary and everybody is gonna have haters, people who hate on you for one time or for a lifetime it don't matter and they don't matter... You just keep lovin them and know that if it aint somebody lookin down on you then you probably doin something wrong!

As a parent I would want to know if my young boy was talking this way and beginning to treat women this way. It is time you blow the lid off this and tell your mom or their teacher right away. He needs to learn very quickly this is not how you get a girls attention and how disrespectful he is being. By keeping it to yourself you are only hurting him.|`|9c2fd922de5a489187cce0008b9c1a19aa	I would talk to your parents about it and have them talk to your brother, also make sure the other boys parents know about what he said to you<br>  they probably don't know exactly what it means but might have a hint from tv like you said or something else that should be taken care of<br>  just make sure adults know so they can make sure nothing is wrong|`|dPzoUnAaaa	do something.

Once picking up my little sister i saw this little kid attempting to steal an ice cream from the ice cream man. I intervened and the next second the little kid is trying to stare me down! He yells at me "Dun be tryina stare me down foo!"<br>  With one kick i could snap his neck in half, but i told myself, What is causing these kids to feel no respect for their elders? The only conclusion i could come up with is the sudden rise of younger parents. <br>  It's the parent's fault because they don't know how to educate a child since most of them weren't educated enough. <br>  Failure to mature causes this. Really talk to the teacher about this behavior and if you can intervene, don't fail to do so. <br>  <br>  P.S. I Really doubt your mom doesn't think you know that stuff haha. She probably knows you know it =P But it's good that you keep your respect for your mother. That's a good mom =]

Wear a nuns uniform and you will leave with a sore hand from the ruler being laid against it.  Wear a mother frock and you will be showing that you are a Ms Robinson type or a Milf.  Wear a grannies apron and long dress and you will have to be loooking forward to a GILF experience.  Wear normal clothes that you wear to school and you will have a normal date.  The options are up to you but I rather take the last one myself|`|YTasscmKaa	Sounds good to me. I'd suggest, for special occasions, dresses or skirts, nylons and heels. Fellas like those too.
90ht2JH2aa	Your parents shouldn't be hitting you and you definitely don't have to feel guilty about not wanting to interact with them.  Please do tell someone, especially the doctor cause it's important for him to know.  I'd make sure another adult knows before you talk to your parents, just so you have backup if you need it.  I agree it might be awkward with other people in your house but you might be safer that way because your parents would probably be less likely to hurt you.|`|qNpVIPdDaa	tell the truth at all costs its ur health|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	This is abuse.

He may have feelings for you and having trouble communicating the fact that he does.  If you guys don't talk to each other, how are you guys suppose to know what the other person is thinking?  I believe that lack of communication is over 50% of the cause of why friendships don't work out.  Good luck. :)|`|PuBllrGIaa	he probly liked you most of my guy friends always made fun of me and i ended up finding out that they like me they just always wanted my attention. so i think he got upset that you ignored him because he liked you<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck
9mHYXrRJaa	Nope I'm free ;)|`|2a0e5d5b94219fa3def0dbdc7b21005daa	not me|`|pEfEOuu9aa	Hahaha crazy question nope im single .don't remember doing anything .|`|P3lNjcHzaa	NOT ME, THANKS 4 THE POINTS THOUGH ;)|`|x691c210aa	WTF is your question?
19ea0ffe56f1755c71f275c227e7fe16aa	you are very normal, if that's what normal is supposed to be.  same kind of thing in my marriage.  is that normal?  i guess......as a friend of mine suggested to me not long ago, a marriage has it's ebbs and flows.  sometimes it's great, sometimes not, sometimes sex is charged, sometimes non-existant, and what not.  when your child gets a little older and starts to recognize daddy and gets really excited when he comes home, you will again realize a whole different level of love and excitement seeing that.  and then you feel in love again b/c your husband loves your daughter and she adores him and you get to see all that remarkable stuff, and you feel love again.  then, it may be gone again.  i think that's the way things go.  ebbs and flows.  as long as you are happy and can remember to appreciate the things you have as a the fortunate person i am sure you are, then you will fare the ups and downs.  good luck.....|`|Cpwedckvaa	I think that love has many facets...there is the passion....the respect...the caring...the hope...the fire...I think that you can feel any given one at any given time. I have been married to my husband for 6 years and we have 3 kids together...I love him...I want him...I hate him...I miss him when he is gone...It changes all the time.|`|XmI8wNaCaa	Well it happens to everyone. This is an important time to put spark in the marriage cause I know alot of men who cheat after their wifes have babies. Their wife is more focused on the baby and sex is not at the top of list and for some not on the list at all.|`|0u9WdWb7aa	Welcomed to married life!!!!  what you need to do one or twice a month, is get a baby sitter and spend at least 4 hrs together. Free time. sooner than later you will both be looking forward for that time. Good luck!|`|FgTkF31iaa	Of couse things  change  but don't let all the fire and romance slip away it is still important. Give you self some alone time with just hubbie It will be worth it.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Sounds like a normal evolution of a relationship. "Fireworks" don't last forever - eventually (if you're lucky) you just become really good, intimate friends. Look up "passionate vs. companionate love", I bet you will recognize your own relationship from the descriptions.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Having a child changes you, and your relationship, for sure.  But look, here's the thing.  People and love and relationships all evolve.  I've been married more than 20 years, and I love her with every fiber of my being, but yes, that teenage blast furnace of passion is only echoed occasionally now.  On the other hand, the admiration, love and respect we have for each other underlies our deep friendship.  She's my best friend, and we support each other when we're down, or sick or tired.  That passion we felt when we were just kids still flares now and again, and I have to say that our sex life is pretty darned good.  In fact, in some ways, I think the love we share now is more profound and deeper than the teenage passion we shared two decades ago.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	I believe that love changes the longer you are together, but in a good way. You start loving each other in a more profound and meaningful way. It has a whole new level of respect and admiration to it, however I do think it's important to still keep the "spice" in your marriage.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	And this is the way it will be until those children (sure, more will follow) start moving out as they grow up.  About the time they get grown, everything seems to come back full force, or at least it did around here!  We've had a blast since our late 40's.  We don't worry so much anymore about the kids (ages 24, 22 and 20). The older two have moved away, one to South Carolina and one to Germany.  The youngest one and I trade weekends caring for our 3 dogs.  He can take off with his friends, and my husband and I can take off on opposite weekends.<br>  <br>  Hang in there:  respect and admiration are good, too.  Children do change everything when they are born and when they move out.  Fireworks really can come back!|`|LVlS4y7Caa	One of the most difficult lessons for you younger married people is understanding, grasping and recognizing the changing faces of love, not to mention, setting the stage <and yeah, I'm the "broken record" on this one again dear...><br>  <br>  You don't relive that ultimate win at the Olympics, and you don't relive that first glance, first kiss, etc. of love...BUT, for many of us?  It evolves into the reality of a life long journey that is the most meaningful quest we'll ever be on in our lives...sustaining love, building that foundation of together forever with common ties, interests and yet different friends and often, other interests that provide autonomy so you CAN be a couple who remain INTERESTED in each other and LIFE.<br>  <br>  I'm a firm believer in date night...You have one night of week just the two of you, dinner and a movie and a babysitter...dinner at a friend's house, whatever.  Better yet, an overnight at a hotel by the beach or in the mountains, walking, sailing, riding your bike whatever - TOGETHER.<br>  <br>  What I see over and over again are tired people - YOUNG people with families not making time for one another.  You have to make the effort, one of you - both of you to accomplish this.  Yet you will find it becomes a pattern and a good way to keep the communication, love flowing.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|O8TA4tMGaa	In my second book, I wrote the following, "You’re sitting in a restaurant watching a couple sit listlessly across from one another.  Their hands never touch.  They barely look at each other and when they do talk, it’s brief, strained, or about the weather.  Their bodies have showed up but their spirits are long gone and all of their silences are painful, and the pain is shared around the room.  You watch this couple and say to yourself, “How did they get here?  They don’t look that old or mismatched.”  You marvel at the loss of passion, the death of love, and then one day, as you stare into your soup, you look up into the emotionless expression of your partner and, boom, you are that couple.  Your heart pounds, your hands shake, and you scream on the inside, “Where’s the exit?” and then he turns to you and asks, “How was your day?” and something in you settles, your mind quiets, your hands grow numb and automatically you say, “Fine” and the long kiss goodnight continues… until one day you snap out of it and decide to stop waiting."<br>  <br>  Can you relate?<br>  <br>  There is a shift that happens in marriage when you have a child but don't buy into the idea that it's a death sentence to love.  It doesn't have to be.  Yes, the butterflies get quieter and the hot, passionate, bursts of love making become less but that only means that it requires more work to enjoy it, to get back there.  That means you create a new language of love, a new way to experience joy on the edges of the day, when the baby's asleep or before the baby wakes up. <br>  <br>  There are couples who have passion, before, during, and after children.  Don't believe anything else.  Just because you're not feeling it right now doesn't mean it's gone for good.  Now, you can choose to not work for it and, yes, you'll be like that couple in the passage of my book above, but that does not HAVE to be you.<br>  <br>  Reach out to each other, talk about it, and find ways to make love passionate again.  You can do it!
tIfo0GVqaa	i always like the circus especially the world famou scircus: cirquedusoleil<br>  <br>  cirquedusoleil.com|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	to a movie, to the mall, get her drunk|`|BY02DhfWaa	in this economy burger king|`|Ezn8CPZYaa	It really depends on the person. I don't mind going to the movies for a date if he's a little on the shy side and I don't know him very well because then it gives you something to talk about, and an hour or so of nothing. If you want to get to know her well or you're both more outgoing, take her some where like silly fun. Go carts, mini golf, beach/boardwalk, amusement park. Dinner is always a good bet.|`|tuXBPrjsaa	go to a nice little cafe' not a fancy restaurant but a cafe' such as panera bread. i dont know if you have one locally but here that a nice little cafe' they have some sandwiches and soup and coffee lattes blah blah<br>  <br>  it would be a good place to get to know each other at.<br>  <br>  also my favorite place to go.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Take her bowling. I always have fun when I go bowling and when you go with another woman, she loves it because it makes her laugh  when she rolls a gutterball and making a woman laugh is what you want to be able to do.

A pizza, fajitas etc.  Thia allows me toy sit across from them and talk an hour or two and really get to know them some without distraction.

If you can get in three hours of conversation in five hours spent together you will know if you will feel comfortable dating this person again later.|`|lUWY9r7saa	u should take ehr to a concert.... or to lyk a rave party..... its really fun.... you have to take her somewhere where there are alot of ppl but you can just be lyk one on one.... were everyones at but no ones pays attention to others.....you could take her to a club jus make sure you can get her in|`|DFSHoO4uaa	well ur right about the cinemas it would be really nice if u could do a picnic that would be really romantic or just somewhere u can get 2 no each other the link should help!|`|AA10907244	Take her to some science museum.

I hope she'll be 18 soon because you could be looking for trouble. Don't take a 17 year old for drinks. You aren't even legal. Almost legal... but not quite. Come on guy. Really bad idea.

qMnuRO50aa	What the other guy said. Maybe you just prefer to be on your own, but when you're with other people you can still function perfectly well without feeling embarassed and/or left out.|`|wZzVuq8Iaa	nope..it just means you have nothing to say...|`|1PWsr8X4aa	well i'm quiet and people are ALWAYS like "why are you soo shy?" and i'm, shy but that's not why i'm quiet, so really it's not the same thing|`|GDiH3dUJaa	No there's a difference. Shy is when you're afraid to open up and talk to someone. And being quiet just means you don't feel like talking or that you're not a social person.|`|v1KqxNXoaa	They are majorly different. Being shy is being afraid to talk to people. Being quiet is not wanting to be the center of attention.
CNgVwJgEaa	Sit her down and just tell her it's seriously upsetting you - you want her to respect you, so you don't understand why she would call you said name if it's hurting you so much.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, start calling her by her middle name too everytime she says it - eg mary jane get here now, ok sue loraine, im coming now! (haha excuse the cheese names, all i could think of)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10531094	She's your mom and she named you, so she can call you whatever wants. You're not going to like everything in life, but that's the breaks.  Learn to deal with it. Good Luck!|`|AA11172374	I would just tell her that you are not going to respond when she calls<br>  you by that name, you are just going to ignore her.  Ask her how she<br>  would feel if someone called her by a name she didn't like.  After<br>  she does it a few times and she realizes you're serious, (you don't<br>  look at her, or answer her if she's calling you) she'll stop calling <br>  you that.|`|BE7b99okaa	just maybe joke about it, or tell her that it bothers you and you love your first name. you don't want anyone else to call you by your middle name, so ask her politely if she could not call you that in public.

I was a cutter and stopping is really hard. My teacher saw it one day and sent me to the school psychologist. Imagine how embarrasing it is when your whole school finds out! I was forced to stop because so many people knew and would check me. Its humiliating but it causes problems later. I'm an Executive now, and I'm so self-concious when I shake hands with co-workers or clients. I don't want them to think I'm crazy! Plus I have issues dealing with stress now. Crying has never been an option for me which is why I cut I guess, but now what do I do? I freak out and can't control my anger so I scream and throw things and wreck my cars. Stop now! Otherwise it morphs into uncontrollable breakdowns. Sometimes I still want to, but I remember how hard it was to quit. Get help, it only gets worse.|`|1RWdip75aa	Talk to an adult you can trust.<br>  <br>  Ask your self why you are cutting, and try to fix the problem.<br>  <br>  Also try keeping a rubber band on your wrist, and when you get the urge to cut, pop it.

From the ages of 13-16 i suffered from depression and i cut myself.<br>  <br>  To inform others-<br>   People do Not want to cut themselves to kill themeselves: infact they do it for the complete opposite reason. THey want to live so much they just try to let out anger so that they can keep living happily. <br>  When people cut or self harm their self it focuses their mind on that one thing. They are away from distractions and other things in life and they cut think just about cutting for them few mintues.<br>  This is a very very serious thing and tbh i dont think any of you people should be taking the piss! <br>  People who self harm are not 'emo'. There are people of all ages, race and kind that do it and it is not a ncie thing to go through. <br>  Yes some people do self harm for attention (and they annoy me to) but not ALL people are attention seekers OKAY?<br>  <br>  But back to my point. <br>          If you are not an attention seeker - Don't tell your friends or anyone else in your year about your problem as you will probably end up getting a bad name! (emo, attenion seeker). But do tell a teacher, Parent or any adult that you think is mature enough to help. I took me 7 months to fully stop and about 2 years to sort out my depression i still take pills but im totally okay now :)<br>  <br>  But if you are an attention seeker than telling your friends is a good way to go about it. x|`|xIUi5QEiaa	cutting as in school/class...well, you both are getting into the habit and it seems natural for you guys everyday. I suggest to just stop for a week and concentrate on school. remember cutting is nothing but a negative force toward your education and future. I know how cutting feels like, you just dont want to deal with boredom and get out. I stopped and everything is fine. Really, stop doing it and start going to class...it's all positive for your own self. goodluck|`|TpdOElQUaa	woooow dont listen to all these idiots. there are so many misconceptions about self mutilation it makes me sick.<br>  anyway hun, i have bipolar with chronic depression and im a very happy and not emo person :)<br>  ive been through alot and because of that i had been cutting for 4 years. so i understand where your coming from. <br>  but really, you need to get help. i didnt think i needed it and it just made my depression sooo much worse and i was miserable. <br>  talk to a teacher, a counselor, a parent- anyone who can get you some kind of help. <br>  nobody should hurt themselves like that because they are upset, i should know.<br>  i really hope things begin to turn around for you hun, good luck with everything :)|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	Wow, what do you think your children will say in the future?<br>  You have scars on your wrist you don't think they'll be emotionally<br>  upset at the fact their mother used to cut themselves?<br>  If it's not for attention why do you do it?<br>  You shouldn't cut yourself hun, it's not good for your body<br>  and you don't want to have scars on you for your life...|`|y3P2FgMpaa	Obviously its for attention! Why else cut? I had the same problem. I felt like my life was spiraling downward and I felt so depressed that I didn't feel human. Like I couldn't feel pain.

W1rCsvTzaa	I am the male in a healthy 20 year marriage.  Your behavior and reaction are totally normal.  And so is hers.  My wife will reload the dishwasher every time unless I load it the "right" way.   Even at the end of a 12 hour day.  So I have a few choices:<br>  - Ask her "exactly" how she wants it done and learn it "exactly" that way.  <br>  - Chuckle and accept that she has a narrow comfort zone and this is not a critique of me as a person<br>  - Get angry and attack her, even though she is simply a perfectionist at heart.  <br>  <br>  Please choose 1 or 2.  Option 3 is bad for your health and marriage.  I know this is hard, but this is very, very common husband/wife interaction.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	She works and you don't? Learn how to do it the right way. If you're not going to work, at least learn to hang clothes the way she wants them.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Is this the only example of this?<br>  <br>  Is she this way about dishes, vacuuming, and cleaning?<br>  <br>  If this is isolated, then this is no big deal. All women have their idiosyncrasies. You have to learn to adapt to them. Maybe she could handle the laundry, and you take care some other chore like dishes. <br>  <br>  It might help occasionally to remind her, gently and lovingly, that as a full grown man, you don't require advice on how to operate a clothesline.<br>  <br>  The clothes certainly don't mind and you doubt her mother will be stopping by for a surprise laundry inspection. <br>  <br>  Then give her a big hug and tell her how much you love her. <br>  <br>  But again, this is if her behavior extends to all housework. <br>  <br>  The best course of action is simply to focus on other chores and leave this one for her. If it's that important, then let her have it and take something else.<br>  <br>  Only make a confrontation about it if she's chasing around, critiquing everything you do. <br>  <br>  And try not to be defensive. Remember, when you look at the situation logically, it's really not such a big deal. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Either learn to do it her way or tell her to do it.

The clothes will dry regardless of how they are hung.  There are sometimes reasons for hanging clothing in a particular way so that they dry more quickly or without as many wrinkles.  I have been taught that pants are hung the way they are worn - clothes pins on the waistband.  Shirts are hung the opposite way with clothes pins on the bottom of the underarm seam.  This allows them to blow and fluff.  Your wife may have been taught to hang a certain way for the same reasons.  If you hang them the way she told you previously, will she still rearrange them?  Maybe you could be in charge of washing while she does the hanging out?  If she does not work outside of the home, maybe all of the household chores should be her 'job'|`|b8by7fSKaa	She probably does not know that is correcting you.  I think it's more of OCD than anything else.<br>  Now, if you confronted her on it that it bothers you that she does this, and she just brush you off and ad if you are not important, then its would be a controlling issue.<br>  There are times that I go behind my husband and "re-do" what he has just done (that's drove him nuts when we 1st got married) but now my husband knows that I have OCD and it just doesn't bother him now at all.<br>  You both need to sit down and talk about this, and work out on things that you do best and things that she does best and you will have one happy home.<br>  Good luck you and your wife.|`|5jMNBO2naa	no it's not control<br>  it's her and her sense of balance<br>  and thus she is obsessive compulsive ( anal retentive )<br>  let her do it<br>  who cares<br>  if she want to waste time re hanging clothes<br>  then let her<br>  and let her yap her flap about how it should be done<br>  in time you get the art of tuning her out<br>  to the point where you just smile and nod yes<br>  do not let it bother you<br>  do not take it personally<br>  like the other person said, it's clothes and not a reflection of who you are|`|RcpRW202aa	my husband ASKS me to fold his clothes a specific way.......I tel him if he wants it done that way do it himself........needless to say he never does.<br>  <br>  if she is going to argue with you about the way clothes are hung then yes she has issues or you dont do enough around the house.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Why do you get mad at her for giving you instructions?

w0yUxzUKaa	what I've come to notice is that if a guy is showing interest in you but is not asking you out directly, he wants you to make the move. If after trying for a while often, he will just give up.  If you aren't really interested in him and you now just want to know why he isn't messing around with you anymore then it could be just that. He figures "Aw, why even bother anymore...so-and-so's never gonna like me..." plus now if you're thinking well now i kinda do, the most likely is just human nature, we don't want something when it's available to us but when we don't have it anymore we want it.
5VdB8njTaa	I think you've probably blew it already by being too stand-offish.<br>  <br>  A guy likes a 'chase' but he will eventually give it up as a bad job and go else where. If your interested in him, its time you made the effort.<br>  <br>  p.s. talk about whether he finds you attractive or not, that will speed up the lost time you have already caused x

DrzuDOD6aa	Oh honey, you are preaching to the choir. I have this exact situation except a different in-law. I've found the best way to handle it is to have the husband talk to them since it's his family. They will inherently listen to him better. Your man needs to step up and tell your sister not only to not dis-respect you like that, but also that you are an amazing person and this is something that is meant to be private with your own family, not the extended family. She needs to respect boundaries. My husband stood up for me and it made a world of difference.|`|JnWzHVnEaa	She is wrong for being nasty to you.  But, you don't talk about things you want to keep private in 'casual conversation'<br>  <br>  I can see why she would feel slighted if she wanted to share this with you especially when it is something that many couples do publicly.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that she is behaving correctly but you could have prevented this by keeping things you want to keep private private.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Are you getting the nasty e-mails and such from your sister-in-law, or from all of your in-laws.  This is too bad.  What a sad situation.<br>  <br>  Ignore them.  Let your husband deal with his family.  Stay above the fray.|`|crxbob5jaa	I'd block her on facebook, email, myspace, and make my cell phone not ring is she called. It works. I've done it!|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	Sit down with your husband and explain to him what is going on. If he asks to read the e-mails/messages/texts and hear the voice mails, let him. And ask him to talk to his sister.<br>  <br>  If she keeps it up, let is be a mutual decision between you and your husband on the next step whether it be stop all contact or what you decide. The two of you are making the decision to renew your vows together, let this be another thing you deal with together as it is really directed at you both since you both made this decision.<br>  <br>  By the way, I would consider it a slap in the face have someone tell my husband he is a bad father and husband (assuming I was married... I am not) so make sure to try to keep him calm. Talking this out keeps things from blowing up! :D|`|YsiJiOqXaa	What do you mean by your little family. Just you 2 and your kids? That should not be a problem with anyone! Ignore her and block her on face book, myspace, email and texting and on your phone. I wouldn't play into her childish games. Tell her to have her own renewal if she wants to go to one so bad. I feel really bad for you that you have such a nasty sister in law. Like I said don't let her misery in her life effect yours. IGNORE HER!|`|lYZ71zYAaa	If your just talking about your husband and kids, than she has no reason to be upset. But if other relatives will be there than she has a real complaint.
JhvqUvlsaa	Don't stress about it; take a deep breath...you can do this. <br>  First of all friends are built through mutual interests and trust. Look around your skewl and find someone with similar interests and who seems friendly. Then go up to her or him and say hi. Then the next day do the same thing. Then the next. Then if she keeps returning your gesture start asking her stuff about herself or stuff that's going on in school like "are you going to the dance" or whatever.  <br>  <br>  Keep hanging out with your friend the way it seems the most comfortable to you but put yourself out there. And don't worry about the amount of friends you have; quality is better than  quantity.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10953999	Proof read what you type and people will respect you and become your friend.

I don't think you will be able to fix it. She is in a slump and feeling sorry for herself. Try to show her things to be happy for. If she walks out on you than she is just pushing herself further and further away. She needs to realize that everyone has crap in their life but it isn't worth ruining your life over.<br>  <br>  I think that it's best to talk to her one on one (unless A is also a very good friend of hers). Don't come at her and accuse her when you talk. Be kind and let her know how you feel and that you are worried, but things aren't going to get better unless she tries.<br>  <br>  She herself needs to put effort in to fix things. If she can't do that, than they aren't going to get better. She's letting some guy ruin her life. She needs to know there is someone else out there for her.<br>  <br>  DO NOT bring a bunch of people to talk to her. That will embarrass her and put her in a position where she will run away. No one wants to be confronted in front of a lot of people. Go somewhere private where you can talk.  <br>  <br>  If she tries to walk away, let her. Call her later or write her a note so that she can think about things. Be there for her, but try to ease her back into her old life. Introduce her to new people or take her shopping or something to help bring life back to her life. I'll be praying for her. : )|`|QmrNZKYeaa	kill her|`|4DGQGHyQaa	well make sure she does not start drinking and dig deep find out if anything or anybody is  physically or sexually hurting her.|`|HrdGdiE0aa	Well either way she isn't going to take it<br>  good.

Bring as many people you think is needed, i would say bout 5+.|`|262RePZFaa	I don't think a friend intervention is necessary. You need adults involved as well. Cutting is serious and if she is that depressed, she may have something off with her brain chemistry and need medication to help.<br>  <br>  Many people grow out of teenage depression and cutting. On the other hand, many people get so depressed that it can lead to suicide and they don't have the chance for their emotions and hormones to naturally mellow out.<br>  <br>  I think it is time to talk to this girl's parents and your school counselors. Most people wouldn't want to do that because they might risk their friendship, but it sounds like your friendship is suffering anyway. It may be hard, but she needs help and she can't deal with it herself.<br>  <br>  I have dealt with many friends who had this problem. If you would like, give her my email address and we can talk about it.|`|SqFmGtjjaa	wow. You need to help her right away. I'm sure she doesn't want this for herself. Don't let her walk away. She needs help, as you've described. Don't feel guilty! I'm sure she'll thank you later. Set her straight too, but also remember that she needs you right now, even if shes not expressing it. If your allowed, try going through her room if shes in the bathroom. Remove sharp objects (including knives or blades that she may use to cut herself).

Whether this is the truth or not, make sure she believes it.<br>  If she starts to feel depressed or has suicidal/depressed feeling, tell her parents or gaurdian as soon as possible.<br>  If you dont feel comfortable with that, tell a teacher or school guidance counselour about what your friend has been telling you so that she can get the help she needs.<br>  I hope everything turns out alright! God bless.|`|70R9JYscaa	Find a rape crisis person to talk to her, usually by telephone at first.  Most hospitals or police can give you the number of some place to call in your area.  They can help her with a lot of stuff that she will go through over the next few weeks.  <br>  <br>  And of course keep checking on her, letting her know that she is a worthwhile person.|`|SiZisNHGaa	you need to listen...<br>  That's all you really can do at this stage. Try to get her to tell her family/ loved ones. It is a hard thing to go through alone, and it will be hard  for you if you are the only one that knows.<br>  If she can't talk to her family, try to let a third party know be that a counsellor or a rape crisis centre.|`|aXm6wS8paa	talk to her on how she is feeling etc...<br>  good luck :P|`|Qbm3Vpilaa	your a good friend , just being an ear to listen to what she has to say is fine maybe you can help her talk to the cops because she's a nervous wreck..and get her to a hospital for an exam right away hang in there good friend.|`|FiHuGwr4aa	Thats so sad. Just let her know that you are there. Take her to a therpist. That helped me with my parents divorce. A lot. She may not like it at first but trust me it helps. And just talk it out with her. Did you tell the cops?|`|SqFmGtjjaa	wow. I'm sure its terribly painful, for you and her to go through it. Listen to her. If she cries, try to cry too. Support her. & be there for her. She really needs you right now!|`|svkOcIgSaa	well i think she should talk to her parents<br>  and maybe talk to someone she really trust <br>  maybe even a guidance counslelor
PUumsOqBaa	Well its kind of obvious she does. <br>  <br>  She says hi to you becoz she wants to speak to you hear your voice or get to know you, if she held ur hand and said she wud miss you its kind of a big hint that she has a major crush on you.<br>  <br>  If u like her why not talkin to her and then maybe end up going out with her.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helped :)|`|zDYKBgGoaa	wow this kind of sounds like whats going on with me and this guy right now! i really like him and i had a computer class with him and we would sometimes talk in that class..then he gave me his number and now he wont talk to me at school but we talk quite alot over texting. i always try to give hints that i like him but nothing ever happens. soo..<br>  <br>  i'd say just go for it!!! i really wish the guy i like would|`|oO76hND7aa	Lol I used to do that to mess with my guy friends ;)<br>  <br>  If you're a shy guy, or react in amusing ways(ie, funny faces, wigging out), she may be just messing with you.

Why would you ignore her =\<br>  Talk to her back and maybe even ask her out ;) ?
TPLxJEkYaa	It depends on what the date is, really.  You're trying to give an impression of "high standards" so all-out sexy probably isn't the way to go.  Something like nice jeans and a pretty blouse would work well.<br>  <br>  As far as dos and donts, the age old advice of "playing hard to get" is actually almost a good idea.  If you want to actively flirt with this guy, then the best way is to let him know you're paying attention to him, while also making him work for that attention.  For example, at some point in the date you could say "Those are neat shoes... but aren't your feet kinda small for a guy?" (this is an example, don't use this if he has very big feet.  it'll work well if he has normal sized feet, too).  That way he knows you're looking at the details, he knows you like something about him, but that you're not going to instantly be won over by him.  Saying things like "Wow, you're much more polite than you look" if he holds a door for you or something also work.  Just be careful not to be TOO harsh, you don't want to say anything that is outright insulting.|`|KyOP56Xsaa	seriously if you change right now the guy will lose interest. He went out with you because your you. Stay the way you are,  and if you try way too hard the guy will think he's not good enough for you and you don't want that.  <br>  <br>  ~x~|`|aiRn2lQGaa	well for high standards i would not wear the sexist outfit but something between classy and sexy. you don't want to come off trashy or easy. something cute since it's still kinda could would be a cute sweater and skinny jeans with cute shoes that you can still walk in. do NOT go on about past relationships, don't jump the gun and talk about dating already. just enjoy each other's company and ask about things that are interesting. don't tell him your whole life story, he'll run for the hills|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	nothing is for one nightstands, so unless you want that then Don't do what the first answer says.<br>  <br>  where a dress that isn't to short and the cleavage area leaves something to the imagination and if you have light eyes then you know that your hair has to be darker so your eyes stand out more and if he is a guy like me a girl who dresses nice and has bright eyes but dark, then i can't help but look at her all night long|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	V-neck sweater and jeans.  Nothing trashy, but still, it's not a bad idea to show off the goods...  As for what to do?  Well, just flirt a lot and joke around... if things aren't going so well, you can know right away if that guy isn't having a good time.  Otherwise don't have a game plan, because dates are rather organic.. it's not like you have a check list or anything!

A nice skirt with a nice long sleeve shirt.. or some jeans with nice boots and a cute jacket and remember to accessorize.. Some of the dos should definitely be yourself and dont try to sound all like your too good.. just be yourself and sound intrested in him and what he's saying.. look in his eyes when your talking to him. Dont be so serious.. crack jokes and lighten up the night.. some donts would be dont try so hard he's going to like you for you and not for trying to impress him or for doing to much on the date. Dont talk so much where he cant get a word in but then don't talk a little you gotta talk in a moderate amount to keep the convo going.. Just be yourself.. smell good.. and eat your food cuz we guys like girls that eat when we take them out lol.. But just be yourself an I hope i helped a little.. good luck..|`|F4jhxDWNaa	Just relax! be yourself. allow your natural femininity to be expressed and be confident about who you are. end of the day.

Sometimes, if you don't contact people, they'll contact you.|`|5kYIteIHaa	If you bother her and talk for months and she blocks you because you want to hang out with her , that means shes does not want to do it.

I'm serious.  Even though we like our friends (who are girls), their minds are not wired like straight girls.  I don't even mean this in any kind of rude way.  I mean that we cannot expect things from them as we expect communications from straight girls.  Period.  No exceptions.  We don't get a say so in there world; we are only privileged to be able to be a part of their world, IF THEY CHOOSE US TO BE.  I know.  Sounds jacked up but, its the path we have chosen, trying to be their friends.  <br>  The sooner you figure this out, the sooner it will be water off a ducks back and you won't get your feelings hurt like I have.<br>  I unfortunately took it a leg further a couple of times; only to be stone-walled (like I knew I would).  You might even think your getting mixed signals from your friend and she might be battling feelings inside of herself about how she really feels about you.  But guess what?  It's only going to get you worked up for nothing.  Waste of time.  Don't do it.<br>  OK.  Here's the part that sucks (but I'm telling you because I went through the same thing, ok?)<br>  SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU OR TALK TO YOU.<br>  DON'T GO TO THE MALL OR IT WILL TURN OUT WAAAAAAY WORSE!  I'm not even joking.  I don't care how much you like her ok?<br>  If you want to have any success at a friendship, good friendship, or maybe whatever (yaah right---keep dreaming), LEAVE HER ALONE.<br>  <br>  If your in luck, she will try and get a hold of you.  Might be in a week or two...or a month or two...<br>  OR <br>  wait a couple of months....then send her a text...<br>  if she changed her number?  sorry dude....your done.<br>  I wish you the best....I wish they wrote a book on dealing with straight guys trying to talk to gay girls.  Maybe I should write it. ;)<br>  Good luck bro.
2nc9k9BSaa	If you can't look at the guy just because he's ugly and shorter than you, then you obviously don't deserve him, nor do you love him. Your expectations of guys are, admittedly, a bit high. I mean so what if he's shorter than you and he's not the greatest looking guy out there? Inside is more important than outside.<br>  <br>  However, I would also like to say that you should just break up with him. Not because he doesn't fit your criteria, but because he lied to you all this time. This just shows that he's very insecure about himself.|`|hhW4j8PCaa	Wait i don't get it.|`|AA11613911	let him think you are a slut and he will leave you alone|`|uWJJyNR3aa	just dump him. it's just internet dating and it's stupid.

Stop smoking, or else your fiancee won't leave you alone (if she really cares about it) and somewhere along the line she might stop loving you.|`|RGHk4K4Naa	i think if smoking is that important to you and she cant see that it helps you than maybe you should give her an ultimatum. Even going that route might not be the way but it might open her eyes to whats going on.|`|tss8aoDcaa	stop for your daughters sake then|`|P3QRHXQnaa	you should try some anti-smoking medicines and try and leave this habit slowly cause it does seem to be bad for your relationship..

Coz you are not alone. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|t4BqZx0paa	write a fake note, using other peoples names 4 example:<br>  <br>  kelly was so mean last time, she forgot bout meeting me at the park just to go get clothes with her enemys best friend?<br>  <br>  then place it like where ever ur friend hangs out then they would read it and see that thats wat they were doing or sometihng?|`|yyMtdbCmaa	I felt the same way..

B1sT1t44aa	He cannot fight with a stop sign so no matter what do not allow him to pull you in.<br>  The only thing I would tell him is that when he can talk with you calmly you will discuss with him a solution for his problems.<br>  If he keeps acting out all you can do is suggest that the two of you seek some marriage counseling to get through the issues that are going on.<br>  If he refuses to do so do not stay in the home and be used as his target to take his anger out on.<br>  Maybe this would bring him around to a wake up call to handle things differently?|`|O8TA4tMGaa	Nothing other people do is because of you; it's because of them.  Don't take your husband personally.  Seriously.  He's angry for his own reason and you just happen to be the closest target to him.  You need to see past his temper tantrum and love him for who he is, where he is.  That means you don't buy into his wanting a fight.  It takes two to fight and if you don't consent, there won't be an argue.  Now that is what I call personal power.  As Jay Z would say, "Brush your shoulder off."  He'll get over it.  Either way, it's not your problem; it's his.|`|N8EB7YkMaa	Don't buy in to the fight.  I would bet he wants you to.  If you do, the fight escalates and he decides he had a reason to blow up and walk out the door to party or visit or b.s. or whatever it is he wants to do.<br>  Maybe you should go visit mom for popcorn and a movie or something?|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Tell him he is right. Then apologize for being imperfect. If he still wants to fight, tell him you are not in the mood for fighting but maybe you can have sex instead.|`|xgvPCQXsaa	Leave him along try to walk way I know where you come from I do the best I can but it don't help.   I just bless like pray for me I know how it feel.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	Fights by definition need two people to happen. Don't let him get to you. We call it "don't feed the dragon".|`|V0qntsyZaa	Talk, talk and talk.  If he won't participate pack HIS bags.|`|t1ZeHkCCaa	Leave him it's only going to get worst.|`|oZV7ukGqaa	Not sure why he is on edge or Angry?? Have you talked to him about why he is acting like this? There is a reason and if he is not willing to tell you the reason than he is not willing to work on the marriage. And if he is not willing to work on the marriage, than something is up. He has done something wrong or he is trying to make you mad so you will be the one to leave. Does this happen all the time? If this is new, than it is worth at least trying to find out why he is acting like this. If you normally have a great marriage than I would ask him to go to counseling if he is not willing to just talk to you. If this is normal for him and he always acts like this, than I would suggest you go to counseling alone to talk through what you are feeling and get some advice on what to do next. Good Luck|`|koP1PaVjaa	I used to have a small bag packed with important stuff like documents, money, and some clothes. Hide it in a safe place he doesn't ever look. If it gets to be edgy, grab it and go to a local women's shelter. <br>  And, I know it's hard and dangerous, but think about getting out now. Believe me when I tell you it gets alot worse.|`|Cpwedckvaa	Give him a fight and then go cool off...sometimes it is the best way|`|UEcEAId5aa	BJs work on me.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Tell him to go take a walk, or you go take a walk.|`|hs793CCxaa	Try the e-book at <a href="http://www.bringbackthespark.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bringbackthespark.com</a> - from what I have seen, it is just the ticket to get him in that calm, loving way. Maybe he has never been that way, but if the couple friends that have used this e-book are any indication, it will make your relationship warm and intimate. He will be into you, not AT you.<br>  <br>  Does he have stress at work? At home? Finances? Lost his job? Sometimes just knowing what it is that makes someone the way they are, helps you to understand and seems to lessen the "annoyance". It can be the way you view what he is doing, that makes you feel the way you do. Viewing it in a better light just may make it less objectionable.  Good luck.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Tell him you are not going to fight with him. Fighting doesn't solve anything, it only causes two people who love each other to say a lot of mean and hurtful things to each other and makes the situation worse. Let him know when he cools down and he is ready to discuss this problem calmly with you, then you will be happy to talk to him about it, but you are not going to lower yourself to a screaming match.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't get the message, then pick up your purse and tell him you are going out for awhile and will come back when he's had enough time to cool off. Don't let him bait you into a fight, but let him know you are more then willing to talk to him about the problem when he is ready to talk to you calmly.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Tell him you are not going to fight with him. You will however consider discussing any and all issues in a mature and calm manner. When and if he is willing. Remember it takes two to argue, one cannot argue alone.|`|AA10531094	Walk away. . . it's not worth fighting.

In fact, no grown adult is allowed to hit you. If he hit your mom too, you both need to get away from him or else it could get BAD. It doesn't matter if it's "his form of discipline", it's illegal, for one thing. Yes, tell your mom asap. Show her the bruise. He hit you hard enough to bruise you, that is bad. Tell someone before it's too late.|`|FiJrgM3Taa	CALL THE POLICE!!! You spilled some juice and that guy hit you? It doesn't matter if he's your stepfather or real father, that's abuse! You didn't do anything to deserve that. HE IS GOING TO HIT YOU AGAIN, and next time it will be harder... Go to the cops, and tell them. I don't know what kind of mom you have, but some of them are very weak and they will blame you and say you got what you deserved. Tell a cop or another adult FIRST.|`|5kYIteIHaa	Yeaaa u need to tell ur mom...thats not right...|`|CNgVwJgEaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  What your stepfather is doing is wrong. <br>  <br>  Over such a small issue, he has no right to do that. Fair enough if you had gone out and messed up his car, sworn at him or something very provoking like that, but you didn't and that why it's wrong.<br>  <br>  Although he may say it's discipline, smacking a child (i know you're a teen but in the view of the state, you are still a child) for a reason like that is abusive. Definately show your mum and get her to talk to him about it - you and her should not stand for it.<br>  <br>  You might think he won't do it again, but I'm sure your mum didn't think that he'd even hit you in the first place otherwise she wouldn't have married him.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mum and see how it goes from there. <br>  <br>  Good luck babe and stay strong!|`|FYR9nQjdaa	Really I wouldn't make it a big deal but you shouldn't keep it to yourself even if he hit you for a disciplinary reason, the only one that should do it is your mom or dad.

AND it was for spilling some juice? !!<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like he has a problem with anger management and he needs this pointing out to him. he can't be allowed to treat you or your Mum like this.<br>  <br>  You MUST let your Mum know what has happened.<br>  Just tell her calmly that you're a bit concerned as your step father seemed to lose his temper over something so silly and ended up hitting you. Ask her what she thinks and if she is concerned about him hitting her also.<br>  Talking calmly about it should make your Mum listen AND think about it. There could be stress going on with him but this is NO EXCUSE AT ALL but your Mum might be able to make him realise he has a problem and to get help.<br>  <br>  You mustn't just let this go ... it's got to be stopped NOW!<br>  <br>  If you can't bring yourself to speak to your Mum perhaps find another relative and ask them to approach your Mum about it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck kid ;)
2nc9k9BSaa	At around the age of 13 (I'm assuming that the guys saying that they like you are at that age) I'd would personally say it's definitely because of breast size. ^^;<br>  <br>  No guy knows what he wants from a relationship, much less a girlfriend, at the age of 13. I'm not saying that all guys that age are hormonal pre teens, but most of them are. Just hold off getting into a relationship/a boyfriend for now, until guys see you as you are inside as well as outside.|`|55b60b3a3d24fb911ae382f06f0edc95aa	I'm 26, and I put an ad up as well as have msg'd girls on myspace in the past.  I met-up with a girl I liked for awhile on myspace and had two dates w/ her.  She was tall and very well-endowed...but she wasn't very intelligent.  Some girl (young woman) msg'd my ad, and I took her out after the myspace girl.  She told me on AIM that she was a small D, so she got my attention, but when I finally took her out, she showed me her intelligence and motivation in life, and that's what got me hooked (I'm a university graduate).  There's physical attraction, and then there's staying power.  Guys each have their own personal preference on how they'd like their girl/woman to look...but if they don't mesh or match-up personality-wise, it's not going to last long.  Both parties need to know what they want and go for it...if you don't know what you want, then you're wasting the other person's time.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	Lots of guys do like girls for their bodies, but that means thats what they want, your body.

The ones who just want your body will fade out.|`|21g5bHfvaa	At 13 that may be true; boobs are very important at that age.  But that doesn't mean thats the only reason they like you.

You will find someone who likes you for you.|`|1oTDy9sTaa	at your age, boys of course are going to be mezmorized by breasts because it's something new to them.

WHAT guy doesnt? Seriously though in all honesty, guys like girls with bigger chests just natural and instinct. Its not real love at all just yet. In the near future, maybe. A guy only turly likes you if he isnt going to rush u or make u do anything u dont want to do. If they really just want to be all touchy feely and stuff at this age, hello they like ur chest and not so much u. If the guy is sensitive, then maybe.

af2bb29a607e269fd8497ceea873f78faa	There are many things that should be considered before thinking of a solution. Do you have kids. How old are you. How good is he treating you. These all are important factors. For instance, if he is not treating you badly, but you just want a divorce because you don't like him, which is ok, you can find a job and prepare yourself. But if for instance he is treating you badly, you know physical or emotional abuse, you have to get out of there. Another example, if you are in your sixties, you did not work in the past 30 years, you wont be able to find a job that easily, so as long as he is not abusing you, do not divorce.<br>  <br>  So, there are many variables in the equations.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	so basically the only reason you are staying with him is because your lazy *** can't get a job and support yourself? <br>  Nah don't get a divorce, you deserve to be miserable.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Most (99%) of lawyers will talk to you about family law free for the 1st consultation and you don't owe them anything until you decide to retain them. You have to be a resident of the state you live in for 6 months or longer before you can file. Yes, when he finds out you want a divorce, the $#!t is going to hit the fan and you'll be resourceless. I feel like it doesn't have a lot to do with being lazy and wanting money but the truth is you would be financially wiped out and in financial dire straits if you left now. Divorce hurts so much, can you not try to work it out?|`|dTaGzh6Haa	You really need a job first of all. It's easy to sit and talk about this now from the comfort of your home, but when you get out on your own things will be totally different--and I don't mean good different.<br>  You have to be able to take care of yourself financially.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	How `bout you pitch in and give it a chance before you tear the house down.<br>  Apparently to your own detriment.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	What you have described is not a reason for a divorce.|`|O8TA4tMGaa	Preparation is key.  You need to check your state laws and find out what's the minimum number of months or years you have to live in a state to be considered your "home state" for residency.  Wherever your "home state" is, that's where you have to file for divorce so if you've lived in this new state where he got this new job for at least 6 months, chances are, you're going to have to file for divorce in that state and all your court appearances will be there.  Financial independence is key.  Yes, you could file for divorce and have the initial court paperwork filing fee waived but a lawyer requires an upfront retainer that's anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 plus all of those situations you mentioned above could happen and you need time to establish your own bank account, your own money, and get financially prepared for the divorce process.  Bottom line: the person you marry is rarely the person you divorce and when you tell someone it's  over and they don't want it to be, all the gloves come off.  Be ready...|`|42qj7Wzbaa	aww...i am really sorry. same thing is going on at my house except it is my husband who does not work. if he emptys any accounts or anything you can get all that money through the courts. and he will not be able to leave you with out insurance if you file soon because then it will be like you have extra protection on your side and he wont be able to get away with anything. you have to get a divorce in his state. good luck. i hope everything goes well with this.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Go to school and get a career... get a job.  Save some $ in a separate account.  If you leave him, empty out half of the accounts before leaving or telling him you are leaving.  So after you do this, get an attorney... a woman.  <br>  <br>  If you have to ask this question, you are ready.|`|UEcEAId5aa	Since your post mostly seems to be about how you're afraid you're going to lose access to the money he makes and not about fixing your marriage, then yes, you should divorce him. That way he can find somebody who isn't money grubbing and self-centered.

Guy #3 sounds like flirting is just part of his personality, like he acts like that with a lot of people. He might start to realise you don't like it but if he doesn't just don't take it personally - change the subject when he flirts and don't spend more time with him than you need to.|`|oPRvq655aa	It seems you like number 1 best, so the next time his friend asks you if you like him, say yes, or approach him yourself. <br>  As for the other two, if they tell you they like you or anything like that, just say that you are interested in someone else.<br>  <br>  If number 3 is bothering you, tell him the back off and leave you alone.<br>  I've had one of those guys before too and they get SO annoying! So what I do is whenever the guy approaches me, I'd instantly walk away, or get up if he sits down next to me. The number one thing to do is avoid him as much as possible, and if he says something to you, pretend you didn't hear him, or answer in short answers like "oh", "ok", then walk off. Also, give him an expression that says "ok, that's weird" to show that you aren't interested in what he has to say. <br>  Finally, hang around your Number 1 guy to show Number 3 that you are with someone else.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	tell the 1.|`|AA11613911	you need to bang all three of them|`|CzS1EiV9aa	1, because you put him first on your list.

b8by7fSKaa	Let's call the guy for what he is.. a sperm donor.  Unfortunately, you do need his to sign off on this.  Make him an offer he can't refuse, give up your parental right and you won't pursue any child support or back support.  Most of the time, these guys are more than happy to sign off just so they are not obligated any longer.<br>  Your husband is a great man, and is your son DADDY is every way except in name. You need to explain this to your son so that he knows the different between a sperm donor and a FATHER. <br>  Let your son knows how special he is to have a man who has CHOSEN him to be his son.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	First you need to ask your son what he wants.  After all its really up to him if he wants to be linked to his biological father if only by name.  Then if he decides that is what he wants you need to tell the biological father that this is your sons wish and need to get him to understand and agree to sign his son over to you completely.  The only way you don't need his permission is by changing your sons name to your maiden name.  But the law applies differently in different states.|`|0u9WdWb7aa	go to public reords dont give any explanations and ask for the forms to add a last name. it will cost you 200.00 plus but its worth it. About taking his bio off I am not sure, but you can try to do it with the forms they provide you, just make the changes. the less you say the better, beuase if you say you are doing it behid the biological fathers back they will give you a hard time.|`|egpVC6uMaa	Regardless of how bad of a father he is, the biological dad has to sign over his rights to you before you can do that so you need his permission...if he refuses, then you won't be able to do that.|`|T22OjCMRaa	Don't change his last name, let him decide after he turns 18. <br>  Even though his biological father is not around the man is still his father and you loved him at some point. You made a child with him!<br>  My daughter was adopted by my husband, her stepfather, and we had a plan to tell her when she was older about her adoption.<br>  Unfortunately, she found out she was adopted (not going to get into how) and it ruined her relationship with my husband and she felt like we "lied" to her for as long as she could remember. I am not saying that every child will react the same but you need to keep in mind that he could feel the same as my daughter.<br>  <br>  PS - If your husband adopts your son and heaven forbid you two get divorced, your husband is legally obligated to pay child support and legally can fight for custody or visitation!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You need permission from bio-Dad.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Get his permission for you new hubby to adopt y'all's son.|`|C59bTKO2aa	Check with your county court about the procedure for a legal name change.  It's not that difficult or expensive.  A politician here, changed his last name to Worldpeace.  My grand-daughter hates her name and is changing both her first and last names and she is 12.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Unless you like the idea of prison don't take the Ice Queen's advice. You can not change the kid's last name without the bio-father's knowing. PERIOD!!|`|mCM363I9aa	first, you would need to find the bio father. he has to give up his rights and then your husband can adopt him.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Your first mistake was giving your son his bio-father's last name instead of YOUR last name. Now you want to give your son your husband's last name. <br>  <br>  Women for the most part, end up changing their own last name every time they get married, but is it really right for us to change our child's last name every time we have a change of heart and get a new man in our life?<br>  <br>  If your husband has been a father to your son since he was 2 years old and wants to continue to be his father, then why doesn't your husband adopt your son? I'm sure your child's bio-father wouldn't mind signing the papers to allow your husband to adopt his son, so he wouldn't have to be forced to pay child support for the next 10 years and for all the back child support he didn't pay in the last 8 1/2 years. <br>  <br>  Talk to a lawyer and find out what it would take for your husband to adopt your son or for you to legally have your son's name changed without your husband adopting him. <br>  <br>  You might also want to ask.....what does my son want? Does he want to give up his bio-father's last name? Does he want to have his step-father's last name? Most important question of all......does he want your husband to legally be his dad? <br>  <br>  First talk to your son and find out what he wants, next talk to your husband and find out if he wants to adopt your son, then talk to a lawyer and find out what you have to do and how much it will cost to make everyones dream come true. <br>  <br>  I just read your additional details. How have you managed to convince your son that your husband is his bio-father when your son's last name is different then his dad's? What possible reason could you have given your son for why his last name is different them his mom and dad's last name?<br>  <br>  Sooner or later you are going to HAVE to tell your son the truth. The longer you wait the harder its' going to be for him to accept that you have been deceiving him. TELL HIM THE TRUTH!!!
crxbob5jaa	If he loves you, it will be hard on him, no matter how you go about it. But you've also just had a baby and your hormones are crazy, whether or not you can realize that. Wait for awhile and you'll be able to make a wiser decision. If he is abusing you or the baby, then leave immediately. If this is just a simple change of mind, you might feel differently when your body is back to normal. I'd just advise you to wait awhile and see how you feel.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I would wait until you're mentally in a better place.  You've just had a child and that's a HUGE undertaking.  Since I assume your fiance is the father, you will forever be tied to him through that child.  I would wait to make your decision.  You may want to put off the actual wedding for a few years and just have a long engagement, which may put you more at ease.<br>  <br>  If you truly do not want to be with him, there is no easy way to do it, especially now that there is a child involved.  You WILL hurt him and your child will not have the "typical" two parent family.  Take a long time to consider your situation before taking action.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Pregnant women should not be able to decide to cut their hair and women that just had a baby should not make any big decisions. Your hormones are so out of whack right now and will be for at least another month. Wait it out, because you may just be out of it because of the baby and your body trying to get normal. Figure out why you are having these feelings.<br>  Face it, you just had a baby, if you were ready to make that decision, then why is marriage any different? Babies are a way bigger responsibility and if you were ready to have a child then you are ready to be married.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	No matter how you sugar coat it, it's going to be harsh.  Is your fiance willing to help take care of the baby?   Why don't you extend the engagement period to see how you feel.<br>  <br>  A woman's emotion is very fragile after the birth of a baby.  Hold off making this very serious decision until you are settled with your new baby.  <br>  <br>  I agree that you shouldn't marry someone if you're not ready.  I don't agree that you should make this decision now.|`|HFcFU6OYaa	You could show him this posting.<br>  <br>  But really, wait it out. Your hormones are still crazy from being pregnant. If you do anything hasty now, you may regret it later.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	There's no easy way, but it's better now than in the future going through a divorce. <br>  <br>  best of luck to you.|`|FzS3aphWaa	You chose this man to be the father of your child.   Because of this choice that you made, he will be part of your life as the father of that child for at least the next twenty years.  Unless you give up the baby for adoption, you have the privilege of being the child's mother.  You do not have the right to take that privilege and responsibility away from the father.  The child deserves to grow up in a family with both a mother and a father.  Why take that away from a child that you should love and nurture?  You will find that being a single parent is far more difficult than being in a stable relationship as a family.  If you are not ready for these responsibilities, discuss adoption with the baby's father and make those arrangements together.  Then you will have the freedom to break your connection and go your separate ways without the responsibilities that you have created.|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	I completely agree with Steph.  If you guys are just recently engaged and just recently had a baby. Let things settle down first before you make up your mind.  Unfortunately this all is most likely too much for you, a baby and a fiance.  That's understandable,  but if you love him still give it a chance, if you still feel this way in a month or so, then speak to him.  <br>  <br>  <br>  and p.s as a 19 year old mom, with a NEWLY born baby, I am sure you need his support right now.
Dkwqj4Uxaa	I would wait until you KNOW you like someone. You know the signs, when you get nervous and talk fast, sweat profusely, have naughty dreams about them lol :D because what will happen is you will start "liking" a guy, "go out" and then your dream man will come along...|`|mpgpImZyaa	You don't always have to have a crush on someone.<br>  Its not against a law or pasted in a rule book somewhere.<br>  Don't tell yourself you wont have a chance, because you don't know that for sure, you never know.|`|A8sLKBrzaa	You don't need to like someone, but if you do, just step out of your comfort zone, and take a risk!

d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	BRUSH YOUR TEETH!!!!!!!!!!!!! chew gum, tic tac would help too|`|ocIsJXHGaa	partyhearty.com has all kind of tips on kissing|`|AA11263103	*Wait for the right moment.*<br>  There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.|`|9ImX52QQaa	Okay, many say "gotta use your tongue" But most think that means shove it in the mouth. Wrongo. Be gentle, let nature take it's course. Just kind of keep kissing, and theres normally a moment where the couple open their mouths, and play around with each other's tongue. Gently. Unless your partner loves it rough.|`|qyZhzCJTaa	practice on your hand!<br>  make sure to turn your head a little bit!<br>  close your eyes (just don't miss their lips!)<br>  keep things interesting...don't just peck or sit there, move your lips around, use tongue, play with their lips. even gently bite at them.<br>  be yourself and don't rush anything.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	tongue|`|QoS8ChCnaa	Don't do the whole 'wear tons of lip gloss' thing, yes it makes your lips look sexy, but while you're kissing its a sticky mess!<br>  If its just a simple, no tongue peck, just kiss them and hold them tight, en-longing the kiss to make it more sincere.<br>  Its its a make out start slow and simple, not too much tongue and don't open your mouth TOO wide, gives the guys a smaller area to work with and its less ... wet outside the mouth:p  {Also, my boyfriend loves it when I lightly bite his bottom lip(or suck on it a little) so after awhile and if you want something more playful, thats always fun:p}|`|3KAiV9zTaa	Kissing:<br>  As far as kissing, just relax.

zCzqRQZ9aa	First of all,congratulations in recognising that it was important to support your family.<br>  <br>  However to answer the question. There is no right or wrong way. Hang around pubs and such like,get chatting. Soda and lime is very cheap,all non-alcoholic drinks are(comparitively of course). Supermarkets are good places to meet people too,but the only folks i've met was in school back in the early 90's and the bars.<br>  <br>  Dont bother reading about it - Because it's all nonsense. <br>  <br>  My one bit of advice is this,and if you take it throughout your life, you won't make the mistakes i made.<br>  <br>  The women of your dreams isnt the smoking hot blonde that you stand and drool at,the woman you chat up when she's drunk or impress with your car.<br>  <br>  It's the one that you'll look at,and for no apparent reason,feel compelled to go and talk to. Thats the best advice i ever had,and i hope this helps you out.<br>  <br>  A girl wont mind the money thing.

Just ask a friend to a movie, or dinner. Cash is pretty important for dates. Usually the girl "forgets her wallet at home" so money is a must. So i think you should get your bank account together before you think about really going dating. work hard, then come back and start up again :)|`|dr0Mi2Cmaa	awww not tryin to make u feel like a little boy lol but thats soo cute just go for it be a sweet generous open honest guy have manners open doors, open seats dress nice, look good lol work out we ladies like that lol just be a goo guy be sincere be urself be real show them who u r n if they dont like u screw them just have fun work into go for it n one day ull find the one.

19ea0ffe56f1755c71f275c227e7fe16aa	in my opinion, you had such little life experience that to make a decision on  marriage at that age was too much.  tell your family that you have to do what's right for you, and to please stop giving you advice.  and likewise, quit asking for it.  i get the feeling that you already know what you want to do but maybe getting the guilt trip b/c you don't feel the same way everyone else does.  i'm sure your husband is a great guy and is trying very hard, but if it's not right for you, it's not right for you.  that's that.  you will go thru many more changes as an individual by the time you are 30 that your interests will change, who you are attracted to will change, what you want to do with your life will change, etc etc.....and it's hard to stay with that person that you picked when you were so young and so far from being able to make final decisions like that when you have no life experiences.  this is definitely a good learning experience for you, and will hopefully benefit you in your next relationship, knowing what kind of sacrifices you have to make for a marriage to be strong, and also the kind of love you need to have to make is work.  you two may not even be really compatible and not know it b/c you are so young.  follow your instincts (a,k,a your 6th sense, a.k.a your spirit) as it is only ever working in your best interest.  if we all listened to that spirit in each of us more often, our decision would be better for us as well.  from now on, keep your thoughts to yourself for a while instead of having them faultering based on others opinions.  your thoughts will be able to figure yourself out better.  good luck and don't feel guilt about your decision.  one life lesson you are sure to figure out now is that you can't please everyone all the time, and you have to know how to make decisions for you.|`|Cpwedckvaa	I think that you need to talk to him and let him know what you are feeling. Let him know that you are not sure that you are 100% in love with him anymore and that you are a little scared to go back. But you do need to try. You may just fall right back in love with him and there may be even more feeling for him because of all of the work that he has done. Give it a shot...go out on a few dates, talk on the phone, hang out...that way there is no way to have the "what if" feelings later|`|ENSGrZAqaa	Lack of attraction can be worked on and hopefully fixed. You were attracted to him before right? But the things that have happened since that time have altered your view of him. That's understandable. I think it could be like that again if you are both committed to each other and work on the relationship together. I would get counseling. They can guide you to take the steps to connect again and I think eventually your feelings you had would return. <br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like he is a lost cause and he is trying. Would there be regret if you divorced then realized later it was a mistake? Maybe. Would there be regret if you tried again and it still didn't work out? I doubt it. Just dont do something you could come to regret.|`|cd0b3bbd8df141c2851cdda176199d30aa	Well... I'm not a big fan of divorce. And I would say give him one more chance. He says he changed (although change takes a lot longer than a couple weeks) you really should give him a chance to show you this change. You should also see a marriage counselor before you give into divorce. <br>  <br>  But you need to do whats right for you. Don't be miserable and unhappy staying with him just cause the people around you are saying to give him another chance. It's your life! if you are truly this unhappy you need to just move on. Stay true to yourself and your heart...|`|7IbT8cUiaa	I wonder if you should perhaps have a bit of time away from each other to see how you feel about him .<br>  Don't turn your back on things yet. Give it a fair go.Make a time element- like say twelve months of really giving it a shot, and then if you don't want to be with him then- walk away. Good Luck.|`|G50ucmllaa	Well you really have no reason to divorce.  Many couples go through changes regardless of their age.  I think you should look into some marriage counseling or at least self-help type stuff (I recommend Dr. Laura).|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Do you know why you are not attracted to him anymore?  Is there something physical, like he gained a lot of weight, etc?  Or did you just outgrow him?  You will outgrow everyone, trust me, so you need to decide if you want to work on this or not.  The fun feelings of love, in a new relationship, fade.  That being said, you were very young and too young to know what you wanted in your life.  Try counseling and see if this changes things, if not, get out.  If so, you have your answer.  Good luck.|`|1146c92abdc9757a27d4e2f824c1d33faa	God said in the book of Malachi, "I hate divorce." C2 vs 16.<br>  Have you found Christ?  I know He is looking for you.  If you two focus on Christ and each move closer to him, you'll be closer to each other.<br>  Give your husband a new try and treat him as if he born again.  You've made mistakes too, but the three of you can make this work.  You are young still.|`|PILm2U4Taa	In addition to loving a person, we fall in love with what we have *with* that person, and that's most likely what was lost...<br>  <br>  Love, despite what most people will tell you, is a verb, not a noun. It's not thing you "have" or "don't have" it's something you DO or do NOT do. If you've decided that loving him is something you no longer wish to do, that's your choice. You certainly have a point about having married young, and now that you've been away from him for a bit, you may wish to continue experiencing life without him. Can't blame you for that...|`|mCM363I9aa	trust me, if you decide to give him another chance you may be looking at a whole different man who you may find very attractive. If he really did find Jesus, I say you go ahead and give him another chance. This may be your soul mate.

fAaLjlI0aa	Because you are hurting not only his feelings but his pride, so to make himself feel better, he's lashing out in hopes of doing the same to you. That is not uncommon. The easiest solution: Don't hurt him.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I've never been one to forgive and forget.  That seems like a really dumb practice.<br>  <br>  If someone hurts me directly and deliberately it is time to move on.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Get a grip, Hon.

Still, on the other hand, have you ever heard the term "once bit, twice shy?"  In other words, why would a sane person choose to trust someone who had hurt them badly before?|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Why should they forgive and forget?  How many times have you messed up relationships?  Sounds like you might be a pro at it.  Change your ways so you won't need to be forgiven.|`|498JdszFaa	yeah try to turn that around. why do women become so mean and cruel to their man after he hurt them? Why can't they just forgive and forget?|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Basically you want him to be a doormat and excuse all of your wrong behavior. Doesn't work like that.|`|qeUoAW6naa	Depends on what you did to hurt them. I'm thinking it must be something pretty nasty. Why would you hurt him in the first place? And it's not true that only men are mean and cruel or cannot forgive/forget. You would also be the same way if he hurt you. Ask yourself what you would do in his place. It's not easy to simply forgive and forget. Takes time, and sometimes doesn't even deserve forgiveness. And yes, people may forgive, but they never forget.|`|3ch6ADzxaa	Well 1st of all, when u hurt some one the best thing you can do is give them some time. Show them you still care [[if you do]] but, give them space to get over it. If they realize they truly love you, they'll have to learn to "forgive and forget" on their own. If you don't want to loose the person, you'll let go. You would be acting the same way too.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Why are you so blind. A love heart is a wound that cut deeper than the marrow in the bone.

bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	You let him have his space, if your relationship is going to be permanent there will be no problems while you are gone.  But he should be able to go out and enjoy life not sit home waiting for your return.  The only time you do that is when you are married and have vowed to foresake all others.

zk93lGNcaa	Because you are living in your mother's home, you need to respect her wishes and rules.  However, unless she is overly rigid or religious, if she is aware that you are serious with your boyfriend, she will probably be fine with your sharing a room.  If you are already a college graduate that implies that you have a reasonable ability to have a mature discussion.  Tell your mother your wishes, but let her know you'll respect her decision.  Be mature about it.  If you are afraid to talk to your mother about this topic, it would indicate either a level of immaturity or a lack of adult conversation potential with your mother.  Basically, just suck it up, ask and take her answer.  If you don't like her answer, live somewhere else or sleep separately.|`|htWw0OlCaa	You need to respect your moms house and just sleep in separate rooms till you get your own place.

jabjwLfnaa	If he doesnt draw the line now... he never will. You do NOT want to go down that road with him and his family and you always being put behind them. See what he's going to do. If he sides with the family then please let him go-- BEFORE you waste your time getting married, having kids with him, etc.|`|c5UAa65qaa	Unfortunately, this does pretty much rest with your boyfriend and how he chooses to handle it.  If he won't defend your honor and what he wants his life to look like against baseless, irrational accusations, then you're not looking at a long, happy, healthy marriage.  That doesn't mean insisting that he choose between his family (particularly his sister) and you, but encourage him to think hard about whether he wants to be held hostage to her drama, or whether you and your future together are worth calling her bluff.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	They are acting way too childish they should be happy for there son and brother but instead they are trying to break you apart. I know you don't want them not to be close but if they want to ruin your relationship maybe you both need to stay away from them.|`|H2oCXK35aa	She is jealous. Keep your distance from her and avoid her drama because she will NEVER stop!!|`|FXINmF6saa	I know exactly how you feel but at this point it comes down to her or you. That's it. In the end he's got to remember that his family has already made their life and now he needs to start living his with you. You don't have to make him choose but you do need to draw the line. Look that's his family but there is no reason why you should have to deal with them. He shouldn't make you deal with them anyway. You are going to be his wife and he needs to understand that he needs to look out for his own family now which is you and if you guys ever have kids. You need to understand that your sister in law is not going to stop she is going to keep causing problems between you guys until she seperates you. He needs to figure out if he's going to allow that. Look if he won't put everything aside for you then maybe he's not the man you think he is. Because if he won't put them aside not completely shut them out but at least make them stop getting in your relationship, then how are youg going to go through other problems. Stick by him and show him that everything is going to be ok without them getting in so much. He's got to realize that if you two don't get into her relationship then she has no business getting in yours. I wish you luck and hope everything turns out positive for you. Congrats on the ring and just ignore her dumb comments. You guys don't have to explain your spendings and finances with anyone but yourselves remember 3's a crowd. This is a couple relationship not a competition. You should not have to fight for your boyfriend especially with his family. He needs to tie up his pants and stand up to his family for you.  ; ) ??|`|lzooHi0Baa	You are dealing with a mentally retarded sister in law.   What does your b/f have to say about this mental sickness?  If nothing, then he is not the guy for you and he is as sick as she is.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	I think your boyfriend needs to step up and straighten his family out... they need to understand that you are going to be his wife and if they can't accept you for you, then they don't need to have contact with you or him.  <br>  <br>  If they are not willing to treat you with respect, then have nothing to do with them.  But it would be better to be able to mend fences now.
762ZZOK8aa	Sounds like you need to talk to him more about it. Let him know how you feel and see how he feels about you.  He might just be attracted to girls and guys, which if it is okay with you shouldn't be a problem.  If you two have been dating a year you should be able to talk about it and hopefully find a way to make it work. Good luck|`|AA10126871	If he has felt any bit of feelings towards you and just now thinks he is gay, then he might be bi-sexual and not just straight on gay.<br>  He might be scared.  I know this is a longshot, but if he was gay, you guys would break up anyway.  If he wanted to go on a break, and experiment (which sounds really messed up, I could imagine) then if you can find it in your heart to let me see if he is, then not only will you save yourself from him realizing that he is gay later on (maybe even after you are married) and actually help the guy you love find himself.|`|d3bBTjD2aa	seems impossible to be gay, cause he's dating you for a year.  he might be bi, but i doubt he is gay... ask him if he is bi? really don't know what to tell you.

Wait for someone to come along.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	1. What do you mean... "old enough"? Just how old are you? Well, you don't need to answer that if you don't want to.<br>  <br>  2. Flirt.

Hang out with the men that have similar interests with you.<br>  <br>  All in all, your question's very vague, so I can't say anything more than that.|`|AA10126871	You need to find someone you like first!  Talk to him for a while and start to flirt.  If he likes you, then cool. <br>  Go out on a date (if he is too scared to ask you out, then you should ask him out!) and ta-da, after a few dates, you should have a mutal boyfriend!  :)|`|yMURftLPaa	be yourself do not change for anyone ,yet.<br>  first someone have to like you the way you are , rest of the stuff will fall on its place..|`|unM3qcRQaa	Be yourself.. be patient.. dont look for him.. let him find you|`|fjSfBBDsaa	bE yourself.. then u'l b sure that u have a boyfriend who loves u for U|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	listen to the one before me|`|ZjUc4waiaa	trust me boys are nothing but trouble|`|d3bBTjD2aa	flirt|`|762ZZOK8aa	Hangout with friends but around other guys and catch their attention.  They should see you and hopefully you will get one of them to consider you as more than a friend and once you work on that relationship he will most likely ask you out.  But really don't go looking for a boyfriend, the best relationships happen when you least expect them.  I have been with my boyfriend almost a year and we kind of just stumbled into the relationship and are very in love now.|`|6mNW5ksAaa	Be yourself and don't try to live up to anyone's expectations.

QMAqzpKEaa	Well, I don't know what that person did you you and I do not know you personally. I bet some people do think these things at a time when someone they dislike is hurt. The only difference is that they do not admit such thoughts to others.<br>  However, you are right. That does not justify your thoughts. You did think in a evil way for a moment but you did the right thing by pushing that thought out of your brain. Your conscience took over because you realised that, no matter how awful this person was to you, you should not wish death on their father. If you think about it carefully, what did their father ever do to you? You never knew their father? What if something like this was happening to your father? <br>  If you can love your enemy, like your enemy or even feel pity for your enemy, it will make you a better person with a nicer heart. Don't fall into the pitfall of having a black heart because, in effect, if you look at all those things that this grieving person has done to you, you will be stooping a hundred times lower than them in being happy over their grief. Do not allow bitterness and hatred to consume you to that level of evil and malice.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	I've found that when an individual is happy with someone else' misery or grief, that person is rewarded with like or greater unhappiness and grief.  <br>  <br>  You should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking that way.|`|4kyGIaZYaa	that means the dad is somehow related to You. you should not have any joy in his sadness. even if they Have been mean to you, support your FAMILY for God's sake! be someone to turn to. forget the past and what they've said or done. that is his dad! and maybe your uncle or something. prove that you are mature and can forgive. have open arms, not a grudge.|`|GpmGePuWaa	Yes you are evil !!<br>  <br>  Tbh, That is really really nasty, <br>  <br>  No offence.

AA10126871	Oh, so NOW he wants you?  I say ditch him.  The kid is both of yours, so hopefully he won't get mad and stop taking care of her.  It's normal to have feelings for him still, especially with the baby, but it isn't an obligation to go back to him.  Tell him that you still want him, but you want to explore your horizons a bit more before you go ahead and spend more time with him.|`|90ht2JH2aa	you shouldn't go back to the man if you don't want to and don't love him.  he should still take care of HIS daughter and help out sometimes but obviously i don't know him so i don't know if he will. but it would be better to be with a man you love and trust not to cheat on you. its your life, not your friends'.|`|6mNW5ksAaa	You're never going to trust him again, and trust is the foundation for any relationship|`|P3lNjcHzaa	go with ur feelings|`|WHV2VDbIaa	You need to go with you're heart. But because you have a child with him, you have a comitment to your daughter. children need a stable father figure in their lives. its great that he buys things for her and he watches her for you but if you think about it, isn't that part of the responsablities of having a child?? <br>  <br>  you need to do what is good for you and your little girl... not what is good in your friends eyes. if he does not treat you right, then you really need to find someone who does. i know that i wouldn't want my daughter growning up in an environment where someone was constantly talking down to me and treating me badly...<br>  <br>  think about it. think about your feelings. but most importantly think about your daughter.|`|HqLUFUa0aa	I was traumatized when my parents broke up but what is the use staying with a man you don't love. In my later years i realized if my parents had stay together then it would have probably done more damage because of the arguments and constant fighting. You want to do whats best for everybody but don't forget that you too deserves the best.|`|dFXBHqxmaa	okay heres the thing i tell myself! <br>  <br>  -the first time its shame on him, the second time its shame on you!<br>  <br>  meaning, the first time he cheats, you can blame him, but the second time you take him back and he does it, its shame on you, because you knew what would happen!|`|DtIu2NqWaa	If he cheated on you once you don't know if he'll do it again.

Being with someone you don't love is never a good thing and it won't help your daughter in the long run.|`|d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	Look, it's your life. If you don't want to get back into that relationship then you have every right to say no. If you don't want him back, then you don't want him back. <br>  The fact that he buys things for his daughter and watches her when you need him to and gives you money in no way obligates you to go back to him.<br>  She is his daughter and you're looking after her, he should be doing all those things! <br>  As for your friends, well they should be supporting you no matter what you decide, not trying to push you into a situation you don't want to be in and you need to tell them that.
aDL7xmt6aa	You chose your way into that mess, choose your way out.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sorry to say but he put himself in the situation. He needs to get himself out of it. If you don't love him leave and move back home if you want. Don't worry about him. He will learn to stand on his own feet. You need to think about yourself not him. I say take the money you need and move home. You shouldn't stay with someone you don't want to be with.|`|I814g6ZBaa	You say:<br>  I believe I've made a mistake moving here, and I'm giving it until _______ and then I'm moving back.<br>  Then you start making plans and getting yourself ready to move back.<br>  He's an adult also, and needs to stand on his own two feet.<br>  When the time comes, and you've accomplished what you need to have in order, YOU GO.... because you're a smart girl who is allowed to change her mind when she realizes she did something that got her life a little off-track and she needs to set it to rights.<br>  Best to you, Sweetie!!!<br>  xoxoxo|`|AA11172374	You already know the relationship isn't healthy and you're staying<br>  there because you think it's the "right" thing to do?  That's nuts.<br>  You don't owe him a car or transportation to his job.  If that's why<br>  you're staying, buy him a bus pass.  His transportation problem<br>  is not your problem, unless you wrecked his car.  It doesn't matter<br>  if you have family there or not, if the relationship isn't working, leave.<br>  You sound young and immature, like you didn't really think this out<br>  in the first place.  Get out of this situation before you get in way over <br>  your head.|`|AA10861417	He helps you out - in several ways but the relationship is not working.   A relationship is a lot more than helping around the house and car pooling.   Talk to him and tell him you can drive him home or take the bus.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Leave him and let him worry about all of that.  Do not get married to a moocher!!!!  Get out of their and take care of yourself, girl.|`|b8by7fSKaa	If you are not happy with him, tell him now! Waiting for later to come will just be that much harder.<br>  Do it now, you are just killing yourself on the inside and resent him more and more each day.<br>  Make it a clean break. Tell him that it was a mistake in taking this big step and you are not ready and have 2nd thought.<br>  Get out now while you still be able to savage a friendship; otherwise, you will regret it and that will only turn to resentment and then hatred.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Okay, you have to do what feels right to you... you have to be true to yourself.  If you are unhappy, you need to make yourself happy.  I can understand you feeling badly about leaving him, but this is your life and you need to life it as you see fit.<br>  <br>  You already realize that it is an unhealthy relationship, so that should tell you a lot there.  I think you need to plan and do what you have to do to get you out of the relationship and back with your friends and family.  He will have to figure out what to do for himself.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	I have a feeling you know in your gut what you have to do. If you know for sure this relationship is sick, you should act accordingly. Whenever, I encounter these situations in life I ask myself the following:<br>  <br>  What would he do if I died? He would still have to get to work wouldn't he?<br>  <br>  Good luck and Godspeed to you.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	you moved to another city to be with a grown man that doesn't even have a car?  wow, i can't tell who the bigger loser is, you or him.

It's either that, or suppress your desires for the next who-knows-how-many decades!|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	if your needs are more than normal ...and your bf thinks they are excessive ...then maybe its not the sex itself but something else going on with you....Read up on a psychological disorder called " nympho-mania " to see if you might have this problem.|`|KwcVoeXCaa	...why stop, keep sleeping with him. or find other men|`|Q0P8QNm3aa	now you know how he felt when he turned 15|`|oM420kqRaa	If he hates it then your best option is probably to see a doctor and ask what you can do to decrease your sex drive. It shouldn't be a problem as long as you aren't contemplating straying. If it gets to the point where he is not enough then you should definitely seek a counselor to deal with it as an addiction. If you truly care about him and it bothers him this much then think carefully about getting married. Will this go away in time or will it always be a problem? I wish you both the best of luck in your future...G|`|pEfEOuu9aa	OMG why doesn't he like it hes weird  that like the first guy i heard who gets mad lol  i say find yourself a more sexual guy if not get yourself some sex toys and show him you can have fun without him and trust hell join in lol get him girl gooodluck|`|omZUyFSpaa	well are you saying he doesnt want to have sex all the time?? oh well mybe consult your doctor?

Sorry.|`|FXINmF6saa	You will probably never trust her again because you will always have the doubt of what she is doing, with who, where and so on. It's best to leave things as they are. Tell her the truth though. If you are comfortable the way you are why ruin your life with someone you don't want to be with and who you won't be happy with. And also by accepting her you know you are excepting to get her pregnant and that will just tie her more to you and why bring a baby into this world if you are not going to look after that baby and care for it the way you should.  Just explain how you are ok now and that it is too late to come into your life again. Tell her you still cannot get over what she did and you feel better leaving things as they are. <br>  Good luck and hope everything turns out well!<br>  *?*?*?*?*?*?*?*?*?*?*?*?*?*?*|`|Xr0DET7Naa	"Only a kiss"<br>  if that was the case why would he be texting her saying i cant wait to see you.<br>  Your best getting over her and finding a new girlfriend, i can take time.<br>  If you feel you`ve settled down in your old country and your better on your own then tell her to leave you alone and go get pregnant by her other boyfriend.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Trust and honesty is the foundation of a good relationship.  If she cheated then that's gone.  If you two never dealt with it, then there is a problem.  <br>  <br>  I think counseling is in order here.  A third party can help you sort through your relationship and get things out in the open.  This way you both can make a better decision.|`|T22OjCMRaa	Forgive but don't forget! Regaining trust takes years and even then some people still don't get over it. You just need to decide if she is worth the fight. If she comes back you will constantly be asking yourself what she is doing and if she is seeing someone. Is it worth driving yourself crazy everyday? Lastly, if you think she is up to no good she probably is!|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	You can forgive but you will never ever forget.  Traumatic events can never be forgotten. For your own sanity though, you have to will yourself and hope that the person will not hurt you again.   Hope is what makes us face our moment and cope with adversity. That is the only way you will be able to remain in your marriage.|`|koP1PaVjaa	You can, but you both have to show that you want to work on it. Go to counseling. You both need to talk about this honestly.|`|b8by7fSKaa	Remember she only confessed because she got CAUGHT. God only know how long she been doing this and how much longer she would continue if you did not catch her.<br>  If I were you, I move on and find someone who appreciate you rather than using you as door mat.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	well, i cheated.  and i trust that i will certainly cheat again.|`|WEqjnCdUaa	That's a complex one and I think it depends on the people involved. The consensus is that "no" you will never be able to trust her again. It has nothing to do with forgiveness but rather common sense. You can forgive but you do not have to allow her back in your life if that's NOT what YOU want. On the other hand, she would absolutely have to prove to you that she can be trusted. The thought behind that is if she is willing to go through what it will take to prove to you she is willing then maybe she is sincere. You know her better than we do. My ex? She cheated on me and I'm here to tell you she preferred to move on to the guy she cheated with than to prove to me she can be trusted again - there was my answer.
Vv7a31pmaa	no.|`|yDS5Jtbyaa	no she doesnt, and shes preggo in middle school, wow|`|AA10126871	I wouldn't get mixed up with those kinds of girls.  They look like they go from one guy to the next, you know.  Plus, she is pregnant.  Unless you want to take care of her kid and deal with her problems while being with her, I suggest you find a new girl to go ga-ga over.|`|TPQ3Sz7iaa	you're in middle school and you're hanging out with some chick who's probably like 12 and pregnant.<br>  <br>  wow all i can say kid is get some hobbies and stop trying to hook up with the class slut.|`|Rt1FfBchaa	why would you want to be with a girl who's preggo......IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!!! that's stupid. so what, you made out, big deal, shes hot........your going about this all wrong.|`|aQ1FzL7maa	cool|`|mAvL6lVOaa	I'm not sure but I wouldn't get your hopes up. It sounds like she'd flirt and say yes to hanging out with a lot of guys. Plus sounds like shes not the best girl to be around, but I don't know her so I'm not going to judge.

Your mom is probably blinded by what she might see or call love because of your step-dad and do all these things maybe because of him but that doesn't mean you have to go through it with her. You should leave her even if it hurts because that's the only way your future will be more likely to be positive then negative.

As long as you don't plan on living on the streets, although sometimes it feels like it might be the better idea. Maybe you moving out will be an eye opener for her and make her realize that what she is doing is the way it should be done. What they do behind closed doors is their business, but who knows if he may get bored with her and try to come after you.
FVWvN07xaa	Whats best for you is to not be in this relationship.<br>  <br>  However,<br>  you love him alot so i dont think you wanted to hear that, not being with him will stop the hurt and fights.<br>  Hes abit of a hyprocrite, hes slept with 6 people, yet hes mad cause you gave some guy a BJ, fgs.. Hardly on the same terms.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask yourself some questions:<br>  Are you happy with him atm?<br>  Can you carry on like this?<br>  <br>  Tbh if hes saying stuff like that i wouldnt stay with him. those insults hurt. and you dont even deserve it..<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|4rLdaCNHaa	All the tendencies of an abusive personality...but you'll never see it because "you love him". <br>    Cry as you will, because your gonna cry the whole time your in this relationship, no two ways about that. And you might as well save yourself the time of listening and buy yourself a second hand broken tape recorder and listen to those sorry's instead of answering the phone every morning.<br>    Take a good look, this is your life or just remember, "Just because you love someone, does not make them good for you". There are times one must have the self love/respect to walk away, to know the difference between love and abuse.<br>    Forget being his first, Fact...men do not relate "sex to love".<br>    Then of course anyone with self respect would speak their minds to him and tell him if he's had previous gfs, then your no more of a **** than he or them, so you need to speak up.<br>    But guys with abusive personalities know what type of girl to go after, they can spot the ones who will take their abuse, who are incredibly naive enough to believe their virginity meant anything to him, who'll fall in love cause he's her first, who follows her heart and to h*ll with her brains, one who thinks little of themselves, who they can control and beat down emotionally, while all the time she takes it and whines about loving him...when she hasn't the brains to see how love works and that he doesn't give a dam about her.<br>     Hon,....your in love with the idea of being in love, that's all. And he's in love with the idea of being in control of another person, but he's definitely not in love, love brings out the best in ppl not the most abusive. Is this what you plan to build a relationship on ?, tears, sadness, name calling.<br>    I think your seriously confused, this relationship of yours is "sheer proof" you don't have a clue what love is, nor have you ever been able to compare it to anything.<br>    Look, it's just this simple "lover or enemy"...lover loves, is kind, says nice things, loves to be around you, likes to make you happy, likes to see your smile hear laughter and create all of the above when ever possible....Enemues, say hateful hurtful things, like to see you in pain, feeling bad, crying. It is the high point of their day to cause you misery. They are happy to know/see you sad...sound like someone you know, hope these two descriptions help.|`|QwOwTk4aaa	has he had a bad child hood or w/e cuzz my boyfriend like this past summer i was gonna go visit him (we live in different states) but my mom go laid off n he got really upset the other night because of something i still dont kno what but he pointed out how i hurt him and stuff like that.. just do things for him that would show that your very important to him and just give him time he'll get over it i promise
woOeYFrEaa	Do you look good in white?  Honestly there are so many shades of white these days that you could pick something off white and only if you held up a sheet of paper against the dress would you know it wasn't white.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about the white- symbolism of virginity.  I'm one the rare actual virgin brides and I never held it against anyone choosing a white dress.<br>  <br>  Plus since you're marrying your only sexual partner I think you're definitely in the clear.|`|mesqZ1mUaa	White as a wedding dress was never intended to symbolize purity.  It was used to symbolize wealth.<br>  <br>  The first person known to have worn a white wedding dress in Western culture was Queen Victoria. It was hugely scandalous at the time because of the cost and because the dress was sure to be ruined. Cities at that time were incredibly filthy with coal soot, chamber pot contents dumped in the streets and the horse manure from all the carriages. <br>  <br>  After Queen Victoria wore white, it became popular among the aristocrats for brides to wear a white dress because it symbolized her family was wealthy enough to afford such extravagance. Even if the dress managed not to get ruined that day, she could never wear it again because once she became a Matron, a woman never wore pastels again. She, in fact, had to get an entirely new wardrobe to bring to her married life, again as a sign that her family was wealthy.<br>  <br>  Non-aristocrats got married in their Sunday best - or if they got a new dress made, it then became their Sunday best. White was never used, again, because it was impractical and they couldn't afford to even consider a dress that could only be worn once.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	Yes you can.  Although white symbolizes purity it was not until the last century or so that birdes wore white.  Now it is such an institution in American weddings that the significance of virginity in a white gown is not so important.  I've seen second and third weddings with a white dress... If you would have a guilty conscience about it and feel you were betraying yourself somehow, I'd suggest a champagne color or an off-white shade, otherwise I say find 'the' dress and enjoy your day. <br>  <br>  Congrats and best of luck to you .|`|mDm8yFcMaa	The whole only wearing white on your wedding day if you are a virgin is not really an issue anymore. My family is very conservative and I didn't get any flak when I wore Ivory on my wedding day. I wasn't a virgin when I got married but that's not why I didn't wear pure white. I tried on pure white dresses and I looked so washed out, but when I tried on Ivory my skin looked bright and healthy. I asked my dad about not wearing white and he said well Ivory is a white just another shade. If you have darker skin - any shade of white will look nice on you, tan skin - try diamond white, lighter skin tone - Ivory. I say try on different shades of white and see which one complements your skin tone best but most importantly the dress that makes you feel the most comfortable. Have fun shopping and congrats on the big day!! :)|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Most Brides now wear Ivory, Cream , Candle Light, Champagne. You don't have to wear white not everyone looks good in white.And besides the" white virginal" bridal gown has really been gone for years. The brides now a days a rarely virgins.Too bad but it is true. So wear what ever color you like.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	you can get married in whatever color you want.<br>  i'm getting married in ivory and pink :)|`|BXz2cyAzaa	if you want to wear a white wedding dress then you go ahead and wear a white wedding dress|`|aipChC3haa	Yeah, especially if you are catholic.<br>  It's fine.|`|uuyjr6ujaa	The wonderful thing about weddings is that they represent who you and your fiance are as a couple and do not reflect in any way what your sexual past may or may not include. brides today wear every color on the rainbow and a few that are not on there too. i was recently at a bridal show and there were black dresses, black and white dresses and dresses with any color imaginable by the company that makes them. <br>  As for the symbolic nature of white dresses and being a virgin...<br>  White is meant to signify the bride is a virgin, at least in modern times. Wedding dresses did not begin as white, as many people think. Queen Victoria wore white for her wedding (though she was not the first), and thus started the modern wedding tradition trend of white. It may have caught on more as a symbol of wealth rather than innocence. in olden days women wore their best dress or had a new one made for them in what ever color they liked best or suited their coloring the best. This could be blue, pink, green, yellow, gold or red. what ever their family could afford or what ever was the nicest in their closet.<br>  Also... The "Something blue" in your wedding attire is meant as a symbol of love, fidelity, and purity of the bride. In ancient Rome, brides wore blue to symbolize love, modesty, and fidelity…Before the late 19th century, blue was a popular color for wedding gowns.|`|KDd3tMvaaa	Yeah - white is the traditional colour for weddings i guess.<br>  <br>  I'm catholic too and i never really made the connection between 'white' and 'virginity'<br>  <br>  I guess it comes down to what you are comfortable with and what you think is right. :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck with everything|`|eLa3ldTkaa	What is commonly accepted, even among catholics, is that white is acceptable for a first wedding, whether you are a virgin or not.  <br>  <br>  The deciding factor is not your physical status.  What matters is whether you have been married before.|`|4bXIamnMaa	of course you can it's a personal choice (traditional)<br>  religion has got nothing to do with your virginity ,<br>  personally i can't see the God squad asking for proof that your a virgin|`|6ef52pVeaa	I think the white wedding dress with virginity is not related. so I think its good if you use the white wedding dress, because you would seen beautiful...<br>  if you need wedding dress model maybe you can visit my blog on <a href="http://specialweddingdress.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://specialweddingdress.blogspot.com</a>|`|a62a59bf15f22da92d36347e9dbcb088aa	There are no rules anymore.  Get married in the color that suits you.  For me, that turned out to be ivory, but if it had been white, I'd have worn that, regardless of virginity.|`|Yb8rJoPJaa	You can get married in any color you want! Its your wedding and white dress = purity isn't law.|`|7WbehQZjaa	You can do whatever you want to. That's an old tradition. Only people you have told will know that you're not a virgin.|`|RLiRS6lhaa	well, i'm not exactly sure. I say it would be fine, wear what you want. It shouldn't matter if you are a virgin or not or catholic.|`|VqilAWDGaa	I think you should wear white, it's your wedding, and you have to pay for your dress.|`|zPvlh82naa	A white dress is pretty!|`|UtiTJddfaa	trust me some many non virgens still get married in white|`|kUE3Ddktaa	You can wear whatever color you want. The priest doesn't care what color your dress is. The women at the dress shop aren't going to ask about your sexual history before they sell you a dress. Who is going to know? Does anyone need to know? <br>  <br>  Brides began wearing white and ivory as a status symbol - it showed their families could afford an opulent, impractical gown that would only be worn once. The trend started with Queen Victoria in the 1800s. The white dress was never a symbol of virginity.<br>  <br>  And ivory is considered a shade of white. You're still having a "white wedding" even if your gown is a little off-white. Most women can't wear bright pure white, it washes out their complexion. Pick the shade that's most flattering to your skin tone.|`|4lL34wJnaa	Honestly, most brides do not wear pure white on their wedding day anyway because pure white is not flattering to most people.  Often brides wear ivory and the big rage now is diamond white, which is a shade between ivory and white.  My dress is diamond white.  I am not having a church wedding nor am I virgin.  I think everyone should go with an off-white because bright white is usually too harsh and not flattering to anyone!<br>  <br>  If you really want traditional, before white was used as a wedding dress color, blue was used.  Blue is older than white in the wedding tradition.  This is where the "something blue" tradition comes from because brides used to wear blue hundreds of years ago!|`|5WP9rLTlaa	It was only after I started using answers that I heard the white = virginity belief. My family does hold that is only appropriate for the first wedding though!<br>  <br>  I will be wearing stark white because it is my first wedding and hopefully the only one! Plus I am one of the rare people who look good in it, any other shade of white and I tend to look jaundiced in it, I can't wear pale cream for that reason!|`|frA6KJwIaa	oh, it doesn't even matter anymore, unless you are a SERIOUS catholic, which i doubt you are since you are even considering to wear a white dress.<br>  <br>  i say, go for it!|`|1r05fktRaa	it ok to|`|7CKipTZOaa	yes its fine... its nothing to do with being a virgin anyways

You don't say anything.  You had sex with both of them, so it could be either one right?  And another thing is if they look identical, your BF won't think anything of it since it will look like him.  Sounds like your pretty safe to me.|`|zDYKBgGoaa	umm...i think that you should talk your boyfriend about it. his brother took advantage of you! even though you pulled down his pants he still shouldn't of done it and he was taking off your clothes! that is completly unexceptable..your boyfriend should understand. he will probably be mad that you didnt tell him sooner though

Fighting... what's that about?

I would not want my husband to have to defend me either, and if he said jack to me for handing it back to his mother I would say "Well I don't disrespect my mother, and she don't disrespect me.

af2bb29a607e269fd8497ceea873f78faa	I am really sorry for you. Your in a messed up situation. If you tell on him, your marriage is over, which actually isn't the worse thing considering the husband.On the other hand, if you don't he might get worse and start abusing kids.<br>  <br>  What you founnd is immoral and disgusting. I know it stinks that you are the one who found it, but you have to take a stand. If I were you, I would speak ask someone in your family to come and protect you, while you gather your stuff. In addition, I would call the cops. Keep in mind, the cops will need proof, and if you told him before you tell the cops he will delete the files. <br>  <br>  Anyways, tough break, but you seem like a decent person, and I have a feeling that you will do the right thing. you don't want to cover for this person and end up being one of those moms who knows that her husband is sexually abusing their kids.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Well, I just did something to hopefully help you. I reported this question. As it pertains to child porn. So theres a good chance that they are going to track your location down by your IP address and hopefully catch your hubby.

There is NOTHING normal about what you found on his computer, that is sick! turn him in before he harms a little kid.|`|2LYIMahxaa	Call the police now!

To be so young and to be married only a year and find out your husband is a sick pervert and desires sex with children. How absolutely horrible for you.<br>  <br>  I hope you understand that this marriage HAS to end immediately, but there is more to this problem then you just walking away from this problem and never looking back. <br>  <br>  Child porn is against the law to make AND buy. Don't say anything to your husband. Go straight to the police and report him. Show the police what you found on your computer and what your husband has been up to. Then pack your things, file for a divorce and leave. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you don't have any children with this man. If you do have kids with him, then you will want a police report showing that he has a sexual desire for children, so you can protect your children from him after you are divorced.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry you are having to deal with such a horrible problem. Don't stay with this man for love or any other reason. You don't want to be married to a man who sexually gets off looking at child porn. Today he may look at the pictures, tomorrow he might decide to put his fantasies into action and molest some innocent child. God for bid if you have children with this man. He will molest them and you will never forgive yourself for what he did to them, when you knew he was sexually attracted to children. <br>  <br>  Don't let people tell you to talk to him and get him into counselling. I have first hand experience and have talked to police about this subject. A child molester can NOT be cured of his desire to have sex with children. Counselling will only teach them how to control their desire and not act on it. The chances of them failing to control their desire, even with counselling is very high.<br>  <br>  PLEASE....report him to the police and leave him NOW!!!<br>  <br>  I just thought you might want to know, that I reported your husband viewing child porn on the internet to Yahoo!7 Hopefully they will alert the police of your husband's behavior.|`|7e8NN8saaa	This is a subject that really needs a pro - but I would suggest this one thing I know - guys that do this usually escalate and merely leaving him or moving on because this is something that you find sick IS NOT ENOUGH. <br>  <br>  Kiddie porn is illegal for a reason. Children are not consenting adults and photos of children naked and in sexually compromising positions is one of the worst forms of abuse. I hate to say it darlin' - I know he is your husband but you need to report it.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	tough one here. Youre damned if you do and damned if you dont.

Take down all the numbers you dont recognizie. Write them and hide the list somewhere. Now when he goes home or to work check out a site like the one below. You can find out all of the people he was talking to by doing a reverse number search. This even works with cell phones. It sucks I know but this is how I find my slutty ex-girlfriend was talking to multiple guys and I had hard proof and she had to admit to it.  See- <a href="http://www.reversecallsearch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reversecallsearch.com</a><br>  <br>  P.s. you can even take down addresses and later on when he says he is at work drive past the girls house and see if his car is outside.

That means with the date, the time, vendors, location, etc....<br>  <br>  I understand you have your heart set on 10/10/10, but if it's not cost effective then change the date.  Getting married at the registry office is A LOT less expensive than having a large ceremony, so consider moving it to a Saturday or a day when it is open then having a small reception afterwards or a luncheon.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	Do you have a relative or friend who has a lovely yard that you could use for the wedding?

I did it for mine.  Everyone was so amazed of how it turned out and they all thought it was professionally done.  Do your own bouquet and boutineer.  They are not that difficult to do.  They are quite easy actually -- my bouquet turned out to be a lot prettier than the professional one. <br>  <br>  Another thing you can cut down is -- invitations.  Make your own invitations...it's a lot cheaper and on a more personal touch.  <br>  <br>  Community parts is a very cheap way to go.

There's a place up the road from me that does the whole thing and charges like 3500 for 150 guests...  still a lil steepish..<br>  <br>  Then in Tennessee, you can pay like 400 dollars for the ceremony thing, and invite 10 guests to see it. The 400 dollars takes care of it all. <br>  <br>  We got lucky with our church. He's doing it for free, but we're still going to give him something, then we just booked a VFW hall for 150 and they serve drinks too, but people have to pay for their own. we're getting a roll of plastic to drape around the walls to cover up their decorations, and I'm making my own meat, veggie and fruit trays from walmart(getting like 3lbs of 3 meats and 3 lbs of 2 cheeses). Then My cousin's recruiting some of my aunts and other cousins to maybe bring their own dish in. I told her if they needed any help, just to call. <br>  <br>  I went to a dollar tree for my centerpiece vases and favor flutes. Everything in there's a dollar, and I saw my same vases at walmart for 2.97 each, so I saved a bit there... My favor flutes are plastic, and came in 6 packs for a dollar, so that helped alot. <br>  <br>  Places you can go to are www.orientaltrading.com, you can go to some thrifshops for some things, and DOLLAR TREES.

AA10065812	???????<br>  If the man is under 30, he tends to want go out more often with his friends.  This is more biological than a physical choice, as he has not reached full maturity yet.  Males don't reach full hormonal, physical, and emotional maturity until age 30, which as an example, that was how old Christ was when he reached it and was mature enough to leave home.<br>  <br>  You reached full maturity at age 24, thus your body no longer can generate strong enough hormones from your childhood to override your logic.  They are still there.  That child within you will always be with you, but you now have full control over it, letting it out when needed.<br>  <br>  Until age 30, the child within still drives to the surface and takes control.  In most males, this will pass at age 30, though there are always the exceptions, and men who just mature slower.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as they, as well as women who mature slower, have the longest lifespans, though it can be irritating to their spouses.<br>  <br>  As a cab driver, I saw it frequently as the years passed.  Regular customers, both men and women will turn 21, go out a few times a week, than a couple times, than once a week, a few times a month, once a month, a few times a year, and growing less.<br>  <br>  This is why it's very important for couple not to marry or live together prior to age 24.  At this point the woman is more empowered to handle the man.  The best conditions would be a 24 year old woman with a 30 year old male.  <br>  <br>  Sorry guys, just as women are stuck with the biology of reproduction, you are stuck with the biology of maturing slower.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Maybe a few times a month, sometimes not even that.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I'm not a guy, either.

otcjMagiaa	No, I don't feel good about saying people are ugly.. or even pretty for that matter. :)<br>  She's not ugly, per say. I have seen less attractive people. Due to the fact that it is a mere picture, I can only see what is portrayed physically. I'm sure she's a lovely person if she's one of your friends.<br>  I personally find girls who put their hair in pony tails a lot to be a turn off. That's just me though, because I've had associations in my backwards neighborhood with people rotten inside that don't care what the world thinks. I doubt she wears it like that all the time, but I love hair. It's too beautiful to be tied up all the time. As for the jewelery, gaudiness is in, but once again, personally I don't like gold accessories. There's something about her eyes not quite right.. I'm not sure what it is though. I'm usually a person who hates make-up, but it might brighten her up. And.. her nose is a little big. It's one of the first things you notice when you look at her, and it's a little distracting.<br>  I'm not going to call her ugly, because she could do things to look better, portray care in herself, you know?

People's true feelings and personalities sometimes shine through when they are drunk. <br>  <br>  Tell him what happened and that it made you extremely hurt and uncomfortable. Don't wait for it to happen again. Make it clear you will not be around him if he drinks to that point again or if he so much as raises his hand. <br>  <br>  Chances are if it was just playful ( in his drunk state he may not be able to tell the difference) he will be shocked into realising how much he hurt you.<br>  <br>  Or if he isn't, then you know right away he doesn't see any thing wrong with hitting a woman.|`|Z5ereta1aa	yell at him, and tell him to back off.<br>  if he doesnt listen or it gets very violent to the point where he could cause serious bodily harm, get out of there as soon as possible and get somewhere safe with ALOT of safe people ( police station, your car, home, a crowded restraunt, etc)<br>  <br>  hope i helped!<br>  <br>  xoxox<br>  the rice bunny =)|`|62e9ba78ee48eedceb41743f5846f0a9aa	The women needs to say something to the man, no matter what.

If you are only using a small bit of hydgrangeas in your bouquet....then you can mix in the roses and some greenery....but I would ONLY use white roses; purple hydrangea; and some greenery....like this:<br>  <a href="http://bloomeryweddings.com/blog/images/may06-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bloomeryweddings.com/blog/images/...</a><br>  <br>  If you are using a large big bunch of hydrangeas...then it looks great just as it is....like this:<br>  <a href="http://totallyher.com/images/2008/11/hyd_blue_bride.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://totallyher.com/images/2008/11/hyd...</a><br>  <br>  If you want to use just a small white flower here and there...then I would suggest stephanotis, which would look like this:<br>  <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/29800626_04e8cfde1b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/298006...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|TWwGN6Uzaa	That sounds good.

R7b150Iyaa	I got engaged in Jamaica last March and there's plenty of beautiful places to choose from to hold your wedding.  The place we stayed in is called the Rose Hall, it was absolutely beautiful with grounds, gazebos, etc. and amazing food.  I think we saw 6 or 7 weddings while we were down there (for 4 days!) which made us all the more excited since we'd just gotten engaged =)<br>  <br>  I heard Sandals is great, it's a bit pricier but it's a couples only resort and is full of honeymooners.  Check out Beaches, Breezes, and Couples for all inclusive couples-only resorts, as well.  There are 3 main areas of Jamaica for tourists: Montego Bay, Ocho Rios and Negril. I recommend Montego Bay for its beauty and romance, it is also the closest to the airport.  Don't worry about the formality of your dress, you will have an amazing wedding and honeymoon by the ocean with Caribbean music and delicious food.  Can't go wrong with Jamaica!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations =)
RsjPhDoMaa	Ofc you should.. However since I don't know you, your father, under what circumstances you came here or what your relationship is with him you should consider what i say and not just do as I say.. I hope you already understand that though.<br>  <br>  I would just say it straight out. "Dad I want to move to Nashville, I think it would be a lifetime experience, what do you think?". Something like that. I can't imagine that that would be so difficult to say. But ask someone who knows your dad like your mom maybe? She ought to know how to talk to him. Just look up nashville on the internet (don't look up things that interest you, but things that interests your father) and come with ideas, show him houses for sale and whatever can be seen as economic "opportunities" or just adventures. I got my dad to take a loan of like 2.5 million crowns (about 250 000 euros) and then he bought an apartment building and made me half owner. That was a success, I'm not gonna have to take student loans when i study at the university :D. Well good luck with your dad.|`|GahpE5U2aa	Lol... how old are you? :D<br>  <br>  You can't just pick up your bags and move to Nashville. For one, life is in the way. For another you need a work permit to live in the US.<br>  <br>  I suggest you wait until you're old enough to move there yourself. I know you're many years away from it but be patient. =) And be sure to get the qualifications needed since you'll need to get a work permit. <br>  <br>  I also recommend getting a study visa when you're older so you can see what it's like living there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
h4lqGBKmaa	Take the initiative on some things i.e. what movie to see, what restaurant to go to, but always ask her opinion. If she doesn't know then go with your preference as a back up plan. Idk, I thought girls liked to be treated that way too.
fBdc2WeZaa	First of all, make sure you have a fresh breath. <br>  You also need to make sure it doesn't feel forced.<br>  Going with the flow could work, but the both of you should be going at the same pace. It won't work if he's trying to go fast and you slow. If that's the case, try placing a hand on his jaw and kind of leading him. Like in dancing, you know? Not hard, gently. <br>  You also don't want to be sloppy. It's embarrassing if he's covered in saliva afterward. Try to keep it neat.<br>  I've actually done this: If you did put your hand on his jaw, slide it down down slowly to his neck. You do not want to scratch him but when your doing it slide the tip of your nails against his skin. it'll feel good for him. And that way he won't suspect what you're doing.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps you out (=
TH6jLouXaa	Ok duude OF COURSE, he likes u! Its REALLY ovious and he is probably just really shy....My BF did the same thing but before you know it he will ask u out ;) <33333 good luck!|`|jK5qZ1zDaa	I would say yes, he seems likes spending time with you and he stands up for you which is good, invite him to do something after school, it's the best way to get to know somebody and he might open up a little more when its just you two alone|`|584MkndBaa	i think he likes you|`|e81b54ff90ee9b5f2d83e6f2058e21d3aa	he likes you...the way he did just like my x-bf did ...<br>  why don't you make some move....|`|HrBibKWMaa	just got for it girl! he likesss you.|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	possibly

0b5f07e5bab316afb60fcb47e579b84faa	Def a turn off. It just shows his lack of self respect and vulnerability to peer pressure. I would tell him that I don't like it when he smokes. If you do, though, don't expect him to change. Smoking isn't something that goes easy.|`|qxrr69bnaa	I hate it when anybody, male or female, smokes.  <br>  <br>  You might say, "Your cigarette smoke bothers me.  Could you please not smoke."|`|CA3DxsFiaa	I know how you feel. I have nothing against smokers, but i hate it when a guy your with starts smoking right next to you. The smell sticks to my hair which is kinda gross. If he wants a smoke near you, just tell him you have asthma and you can't stay with him while he does that. Get up and leave.|`|COs7vGWSaa	i think its a turn off when anyone smokes. it stinks and it gets all in your pours. And you say hes in 11th grade. Does he think hes cool because he smokes cause most ittle kids do,and he is still a little kid if he couldnt even wait for the legal age to start. Smoking is in no way attractive.|`|7LRPvZkhaa	its a turn off for me but, if you really like him then you can over look that beacuse unfortunately telling him probably wont do anything cause hes addictedd|`|v8Xr0Mn9aa	yes, they stink.if you don't want to break up with him tell him to stop smoking.but if he's turning you off i don't see you with him long.
bMbFw8dwaa	Yes and I rightfully so. I am currently the other woman in a situation and reason I exist in this is because their marriage is based on lies. Now I don't consider myself no saint but I ain't no fool either. I getting some benefits out of this. I am not emotionally invested so it is amusing what two people who have not found themselves do. People have to know themselves before they become husband and wife.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	LOST if all you can offer as a wife men can get from skanks at clubs there are more problems than loose women.<br>  <br>  Maybe it is because many boys are from divorced families, see what the life of daddy is like and said to themselves I dont want to be him.|`|LNeSlzCCaa	YEs, marriage is not regarded how it used to be...sad thing...why would guys want to get married they get what they want for skanks at clubs....|`|09k5GLLkaa	No|`|3ox4lYu6aa	I don't know about others, but I know my boyfriend is. He proposed to me and we set the date and now he is saying he doesn't know when he wants to get married and he is confused and he doesn't like talking about it much.|`|X3YazRSoaa	i do believe that but if a guy or girl really love you they will, but somtimes people frick out when you say wedding or marriage.|`|rcut6bhoaa	No, most people don't know what they are getting into, or they take the vows lightly.|`|n8lXItGraa	Yes I do think people are avoiding marriage...I know I am!
d942a137c6eecec81731fde38d574760aa	Whatever the case is, he doesn't sound  like an upstanding guy that you'd want to bring home to mom. It sounds to me (as harsh as it is) that he was just using you. As far as him pushing you out of his life.. it maybe various reasons. He could have used you and has no use for you anymore. He could be mad that you won't go as far as he would like. It could also be that someone else caught his attention, or he could be weirded out about the whole thing. In any case, he's the jerk. Of course you are both very young and naive and haven't learned the proper tools needed to deal with a situation this mature. (No offense, I just speak the truth). Sexuality is something that even adults have a tough time with. This is why God created sex solely and exclusively for use in marriage. Not that I am perfect, but if everyone used it for its intention, the world wouldn't be as messed up as it is. However, to answer your question... he did it because he's a guy, he thinks in his pants, he found a new toy and wanted to try it out, he's selfish and had no concern for you. Take this as a lesson learned, forget about him and don't let any other guy take advantage of you again. Save it ALL for marriage! It's well worth it!|`|zlLhETFtaa	It sounds like he just wanted to see how far he would go.<br>  He's a pig.<br>  If you would've went farther he probably wouldn't act like that.<br>  But I'm not saying to go farther.<br>  He's not worth it if that's the main reason you saw eachother.|`|rc8Hg8e0aa	He wanted to hit it and quit it ;)<br>  If you never went that far with him and he kept trying, then he most likely just got tired of trying and took out his anger by saying those things to you.|`|aXm6wS8paa	im guessing he likes you more than a friends<br>  im not so sure good luck! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnvenS2b5209DLjfg58d4Nzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309163641AAjGdeX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|EOU1i64Paa	the dude a freak. sounds like he's a little lose in the head, if you ask me. i'd stay away from him, verbal abuse can turn physical real quick|`|1LmhxjoOaa	he wants to go a step further, and since u said NO, then he doesn't want to show any more feelings 4 u anymore. this is how guys usually act.

You really shouldn't get upset. Boys in your life will come and go, and you cannot sulk over them. <br>  <br>  Um, this boy most likely wanted you for only your body or good looks and what to "do" it with you. Nothing else. Again: boys are gross, perverted homo sapiens. Please don't worry too much about it. If he liked you, he would come running back to you begging for you to forgive him. Since I doubt he's done that, just get over him because your real soulmate will come some day.|`|1NvJ8fUVaa	truthfully, i think he took advantage of you and you should do something to stop him doing it to others. people like that will just grow up doing the same mistakes over and over again. gradually the mistakes get worse.. may start out small but will grow in time. then stay far away from him. he sounds like nothing but trouble.|`|hVD8usghaa	this guy is saying this because you didnt go far. now if you didnt want to you dont have to. never go far with some one who trying to make. and know you dont have to far for a boy or man|`|nb0F8qF1aa	hes a jacka$$ who just wanted to use you|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I don't think he is your friend at all, but he took advantage of you.

I lost my mobile phone and I guess she must have texted me (she always does!) so I couldn't text her so the next day I left flowers for her to say thanks for the cake and coming to my party. Then I emailed her asking for her tel number again but she won't reply and I know she read it.

She thinks you're pretty, and she's jealous. But keep that one to yourself to avoid arguments. Just avoid her. You dont want to be around those kinds of people. That stuff might rub off on you, and you might start becoming like her. Thanks :)|`|PWH0nxJCaa	This witch is jealous. I dont know what shes jealous of, but you just have to ignore her.

As long as you don't use someone for sex or get someone pregnant and turn your back on that person and your child. <br>  <br>  You more then have the right to turn your back on the world, lock yourself safely in your house and never let anyone in your life or in your heart.<br>  <br>  The fact that you are asking us if we think there is something wrong with you, tells us you aren't sure that your lifestyle is a healthy one and that maybe some day you might start feeling lonely, but you will be unable to change after being this way for so many years.<br>  <br>  Counselling can't hurt. Find out why you feel this way and if with a counsellors help you can get over the pain you have experienced in your past that is causing you to go to such great lengths to protect yourself from ever being hurt again.<br>  <br>  You may be broken, but you can be fixed.

Also, she can do it from oral sex, as a Florida doctor learned the hard way.  Another woman, with whom you never had sex, could take a used condom and get pregnant.  Either way, you pay child support.<br>  <br>  Finally, the woman need not tell you she had your child and can wait up to 23 years, depending on the state, to file retroactive child support on you.<br>  <br>  So, if you don't want to be a dad, get clipped, or switch orientation.|`|hWuS3AlLaa	There is nothing wrong with you.

KjF0p72naa	Depending on what happened "in the beginning" you may need to speak to someone. Maybe it's not just him. If you were hurt to the point of this being a burden, it could turn out to feel that way with any man you choose to try to share yourself with. You can't make the damage heal without some treatment.

MtQ9ea2Uaa	I really think it depends on the person.. When my ex-boyfriend and I were going out last year my grades were pretty good.<br>  <br>  Now I don't have a boyfriend and my grades are terrible.|`|0b5f07e5bab316afb60fcb47e579b84faa	Yah. That's why in my freshman year, my grades went from As and Bs to Cs and Ds. Sucks, doesn't it?|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Not at all. I just made a rule for myself this year (when my bf and I were still together) that unless I had finished all my homework and studying, I wasn't allowed to go see him until I had. He made me happy and when I'm happy I can concentrate on things and succeed in everything.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If your boyfriend or girlfriend makes education a top priority, then it would not affect school grades.  However, for some cases, it affects school grades due to spending time with each other constantly.|`|PK2mFkQ5aa	for me, not at all. for people that dont have a great grasp on their life, then yeah. of course, that describes the majority of people in high school or middle school.|`|7ulpcNi7aa	if u let it...mine did, my grades got better he helped me study and encouraged me|`|aiRn2lQGaa	not if you can balance both of them. i balance college taking 6 classes, and two jobs and still am doing great with balancing my boyfriend into my life and we have an amazing relationship. you just have to understand that school comes first and that it's okay to say "hey sweetheart i have so much to do tonight so i can't call or come over but i love you very much"|`|z7Zb1jY2aa	To me? Yes. i try to stay out of relationships around important tests because i spend half of my time with my head in the clouds thinking about a certain guy and that puts my grade at risk.|`|zX01mIZnaa	from my experience yes !<br>  even liking someone a lot can affect your grades and concentration.<br>  you need to find balance ! :)|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	It can.If you spend time hanging out with them instead of studying, and then go through a break up and can not concentrate on your work.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	If you mean making you concentrate less and fail, then not all the time.

Other times, it destracts you, you think about them all the time. Skip homework when you want to hang out with them. Its worse when they don't go to your school because you will want to skip anything to get time with them. It also matters how the relationship is going...love can be depressing.|`|ZxEkyr1Kaa	I dont know I think It depends of how much you love him.Do you love him that much to just think about him all day long or actually you know be all like I have a bf thats cool but that means I need to keep my grades up1It depends on your character your personal point of view.|`|zY7boFYNaa	It depends on the person.<br>  Like myself, It will not.<br>  <br>  You should just not let your boyfriend and your school grades interfere w/ everything<br>  have a balance in everything you do, and you'll do just fine.|`|AA10126871	It doesn't unless you let it.  You have to work your time properly, not daydream about him in class, and don't skip homework to talk to him on the phone about things.  You're probably in high school right now - how do you think college kids do it?|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	It could, it depends on how much time and attention you are putting towards your other half.

Having a genious boyfriend like mine doesn't hurt though.|`|AA12063813	well, if you study the same with or without the bf/gf... then no.<br>  but if you think you spend too much time with them than <br>  schoolworkk.... then yes.|`|EtXktTgbaa	it matters what your like. if you spend all of your time with them your grades will plummet...|`|oYqKiocLaa	It only does if you obsess about them all the time and can't focus on school|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	Nop theres always time for lover haha|`|qkUnVwR1aa	its possable|`|BdLUxSgpaa	It can|`|CzIaAnsraa	yea - it either makes u work harder or u get lazy|`|1jltjtjSaa	kinda, if u really like him/her|`|JAruRfYqaa	it all depends on you|`|A0sUrmgTaa	If he's all u ever think about, then...yes|`|e81b54ff90ee9b5f2d83e6f2058e21d3aa	if you can manage your time for studies ,leisure time and spend your time with your bf/gf, it will be okay and it might affect your grade positively. in my college most of the top students in relationship with other..however, if you can't manage you time and can't focus in your studies...it will be affect you school grades negatively.|`|404dbf27fa7877e868281fc2f6fdff39aa	I would imagine that it does.<br>  Espcially the part about getting one or letting one go.<br>  This is because there are many chemicals involved in the attachment and detachment processes,<br>  so that it's like an addiction.<br>  If you're with the same person for two or three years during school, you're probably bettr off thatn the lonely ones, or the ones who are always breaking up and moving on.<br>  People who are in flux like this tend to not be bale to eat, etc, both when crushing and when heartbroken.<br>  So, if you must date, and it might be good to always feel loved rather than looking for lvoe,<br>  then I hope all your relationships are healthy, and last a long time, so that you can get on with your life even while you're in them.|`|W82NIztjaa	depends on whether you have a burger fetish or a grill fetish. a grill fetish will affect your school grades because you will be in the hospital from burns. if you have a burger fetish you will be fat and thus have more time to work on work rather than talking to people who no longer like you|`|XzByuLfkaa	it caan.<br>  i mean, theyre definitely distracting, and since theyre like always on your mind..you can forget, or not even care about like remembering school work and stuff.<br>  it depends on the guy and it depends on you.|`|106TRJSIaa	yes if you let it because you keep thinking of her/him then you dont study as much so you doze of thinking of them so if your thinking about it dont let it destract you.|`|xBq8cGzKaa	well sometimes it can if they are completely ont into school but if he/she is smart and gets good grades you should be fine|`|RzIT2Po2aa	it could if you and your boyfriend only think about each other everyday and if you dont stay on track when there is something to do|`|3FTBDoNYaa	I'd say it does, but it only depends on how you act or how your boyfriend/girlfriend affects you.|`|vhjfmHPhaa	maybe because you might not stop thinking about him/her.|`|w9Pl2gbraa	Not to much.|`|7no23XV6aa	It all depends on how u take it.|`|x3gIrx50aa	yes, of course.|`|4xmwahZoaa	i donno
lvOR401haa	Look for other companies and see what they charge for a comparison.<br>  <br>  But given it's your first wedding video, perhaps give them less than you'd charge, say if you were doing this a lot and had the experience - will be good for business too!|`|hkwBR1moaa	I've seen them as low as $700 and I have seen them as high as $5000.  It all depends on what they want and how much time and travel is involved.  Your best resource would be to check out other videographers in the area, see the different packages they offer and what it includes so you have an idea what is the norm in your area.  <br>  After that, come up with a reasonable price lower then the norm since this is a first for you.  Make sure the couple knows that this is your first time shooting a wedding.

Now the "or" part is kicking in.|`|9OcuUBa8aa	First take a deep breath.  Then, try to understand that the only way to get past the pain is to go right through it.  Sometimes people literally feel they are dying or in physical danger when marriages are failing.  Don't be surprised by that.  Talking to your wife is always good, but you really need time to think on your own.  Avoid drugs/alcohol for the time being at least.  Write out your thoughts, it helps keep them from spinning in your mind.  I understand you are attached to her, but realize that love and attachment are not the same thing, and that no one other person is ever truly a life support system for another.  You are your own complete person, whether you want to be or not, which means you have to sort this out in your mind to some extent before doing much of anything.  When you feel you can set the panic and neediness aside for a bit, that would be a good time to do your own internal work.|`|AA10226585	Yeah, some of the other posters here have jumped on you for sounding so whiny, and yeah, you do.  But been there, done that myself.<br>  <br>  The best thing would be to have a long heartfelt conversation with your wife.  You say that you've not been honest with her over financial matters.  Well, trust, once lost, is almost impossible to restore; no matter how hard you try, there will still be that nagging doubt in the back of her mind.  <br>  <br>  But, another thing comes to mind.  Do you recall your marriage vows?  Were they the traditional 'love and honor, care and cherish, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part?' vows?  If that's the case, who is being dishonest with whom here?  It sounds like you've been fairly successful in the financial side of your life, at least until fairly recently.  Have you and your wife perhaps put too much emphasis on material things?  If you both took a vow to stay together, for better or worse, and she's ready to abandon you because you had a momentary lapse of reason, and one lie led to another as lies usually do, then who is breaking their vow, before God and all mankind?<br>  <br>  If you are truly repentant, and can show that you've changed, and are willing to pay the price in the disapproval and lingering doubts of your wife, then you should do whatever you can to try to restore your marriage--both of you.  If your wife is more concerned about the loss of material things, the house, the business, her 'standing in the community', her pride, than she is about accepting the fact that her husband is a flawed, imperfect human being, then perhaps you would be better off separating.<br>  <br>  A lot of what you've talked about losing, your dream house, your business, your creations, are all material things.  They could just as easily be destroyed in a wildfire, a flood, a hurricane.  They will not last; even the best of houses eventually crumbles; even the best-run business eventually fails; the only things that truly matter are the things of the heart, and of the mind.  What is essential is invisible to the eye.<br>  <br>  I have no idea how you feel about religion, but if you have a Bible handy you might read through 1 Corinthians 13, where the apostle Paul gives one of the best definitions of what love truly is that has even written (the KJV uses 'charity' where other translations use 'love' but if you make the substitution yourself you'll get the meaning).  Another passage would be the first part of the first chapter of James, about how suffering is a necessary thing to improve strength and endurance.  In times where I've been hurting, the Bible has always been a great refuge and a source of strength.  (I'll include a link to a website with these references below.)<br>  <br>  One last thought--there is always another dawn.  No matter how dark the night, time does pass.  Tomorrow is always another day.|`|bA6udclwaa	Very sad situation you are in. I am on the other side of the coin from you. I am in the same situation your wife is in. I was with a man for nearly 10 years, we have 4 children, and i was devoted to him. He lied to me over and over and over again, about finances and his use of drugs was apparently not a big issue for him. It took 7 years for me to get to the point of leaving and not being able to go back. I still love this man and will love him for the rest of my life. I stood back and watched for 6 months while he continued to ruin himself. All i needed for him to do was come home and tell me honestly that he would change, and show me he was ready to turn over a new leaf, i realise now that it was silly of me. He is 41 years old, he wont change and even if he did come home and stop the lies and crap it would only last a little while and he wouldnt be happy because he would be changing to suit me and the family, not changing to suit himself. He has a good heart, he was a great mate of mine in many ways and i miss him like hell, but once us women get to that stage where we have lost respect for our men, thats that. It will take you to move on for her to ever want you back. You will have to quit whinging about the dream house and family your going to lose and move yourself on, stand tall, take it like a man and continue to prove to her from afar that you are willing to step up and take responsibilty for your actions, only then she may begin to believe that you mean what you say and say what you mean. I wish you luck.|`|n3pkbRizaa	All women are cold hearted!@#!@$#%$. They prtend to have feelings till they get what they want then they are done with you.

y6gVmhHxaa	I would invite your family and friends to the shower.  If I were a friend I would probably be insulted if I knew you were having a shower and I wasn't invited but you invited me to the bach party.  I would leave family out of the bach party, invite your friends and bridesmaids.  Immediate family and wedding party is fine for the rehearsal dinner.  You can tell members of the wedding party that money is getting tight so you would prefer they didn't bring a date, but if any of them are married or in a long term relationship you should invite them also.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	your bachelorette party should be your attendants and close friends.|`|zPvlh82naa	The bachelorette party is usually the girls in the bridal party.

I wouldnt say anyone who doesnt know how to have fun. dont bring like grandmoms and stuff. maybe bring ur female family and female friends who you are CLOSEST to should be invited to the bachlorette party, the ones u can have fun with!!!<br>  <br>  hope i helped

When you're in love it simply belongs to it that you are intimate, and you shouldn't let the distance affect your "private time."  Even if you're not in the same room, state, country or continent, it doesn't matter. All you need is a phone, instant messaging or (my personal favorite) a webcam. Tell him/her what you think and how you feel. Tell him/her naughty things. Write a romantic/erotic story with the two of you or do role-playing. If you wanna go farther, use your webcam and show your partner a little "more" of you.|`|goG3d3Liaa	tell him that your gonna take a poop, get a syringe and inject the poop under his skin so it creates a blister than your gonna pop it and eat it!|`|m3x0TsY6aa	"chuckie cheese, where a kid can be a kid!"<br>  hahah if ya kno wat i mean|`|D2cCZVQXaa	Baby, I wanna slooowly pull out your golf club and hit me a hole in one. ;D

wqRwSaGSaa	leave <br>  iv been in this same relationship<br>  he wound up raping me.|`|vqqxD6Teaa	You need to wacth those kinds of guys. If he has that bad of a temper then there's the possibility that he could become violent. Any guy who treats you like that shouldn't even be worth your time.|`|D5MhP9YEaa	yess ignore him for a few days and make him feel really bad<br>  but the important thing is to figure out why he gets so animated<br>  and have a talk with him about it<br>  if u get in another fight, dont talk while its happening<br>  and if he ever hits you, (i dont know the guy, he prolly wouldnt do that)<br>  then why stay with him?<br>  hopefully he wouldnt..|`|LAVk7GQZaa	Just lay low for a few days... or a day depending on how long you think he will still be upset. The next time you talk to him tell him you are sorry (but only if you really are), by that time you both will most likely be over it. But if this happens on a regular base then maybe you just aren't met to be.|`|sMUw3bJCaa	try to talk to him about it, if not leave him it can easily get worse later. <br>  Im talking of self experience, my ex was like that and in the end he started hitting me.|`|RfAh74uzaa	Personally, I have been in a relationship like that and I found that he was actually the one who really wanted to end the relationship ... He would yell and scream at me until I would get soo pissed off that I would say things.. like I should just break up with you!! so in the end I would look like the bad guy instead of him. But Im telling you right now, it was SOO worth it!! not being with him anymore, Now Im with a guy and have been with him for 3 years. He never yells at me... I mean we get in arguments over stupid things but we would talk it out or take a 15min break from eachother so we wouldnt result to yelling and hating... but in the end no one is feeling like you do right now.<br>  I think you should really talk to him and see if there is a deeping issue that is bothering him and tell him how you feel when you fight... and if he just keeps doing it and wont listen... find someone worth your time!! Hope all goes well!|`|W2GLkhOfaa	Talk to him about this, and if he blows up, leave.<br>  No matter what, anyone deserves better then that. <br>  IF you leave then he will realize. <br>  And if not. then you dont deserve him.|`|V6VYeShhaa	It seems like he has a temper problem that he himself hates, and would hate to admit it (which is why he tries to force the responsibility onto you).  In this way he's using you as a kind of emotional sponge but to his benefit.  You must let him know this is not ok and that it upsets you, that you don't deserve to be treated like this.  But also, i doubt he would respond to shouting or a temper back at him, he may shut off at this.  I would suggest talking to him when he is calm and can see you are upset.  I know this is difficult as when things are good you probably don't want to spoil the nice mood but it really is for the best in the longrun.  He must respect you or things could get a lot worse.  I do believe people can change but only when people want to change, and first, they have to acknowledge they have a problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck, but remember, you do not deserve to be treated like this and if he is not willing to change his behaviour then there are always plenty more fish in the sea!|`|v8Xr0Mn9aa	no you shouldn't ignore him you should break up with him. they say a drunk man speaks a sober mind and an angry person speaks a calm one. he's only telling you how he really feels about you.and if he's putting you down now it can only get worse. temper-mental people usually become violent people.next he'll be beating on you.it's obvious he doesn't appreciate you.sometimes when you're mad you cant take things back. he can lower your self esteem. i had a friend that had a big mouth and spoke her mind in a drop of a dime- she got married and i swear the guy put her down and she has no back bone. i don't know what happened but she has no get up about herself anymore.she just takes it and sits like a log. don't be her. make a stand for yourself right now.
pK708QPOaa	I don't think swearing is as bad as people would want you to believe - it's just about knowing when and where it is appropriate behavior. As for the drinking every weekend.. that is really the parent's job to monitor their own kid's behavior. They don't seem as strict as you say they are, if she can get away with this every weekend. If you "tell" on her, it will surely ruin your friendship. Have you tried talking to her and expressed your concerns? That is what grown adults do. Sometimes, people just grow apart.. there is nothing that can be done. You can't really blame her school for her actions because I'm sure there are some kids in your school who do the same as her. If you think she is going down the wrong road, you should express your concerns first and if that fails.. just give her some space. No one can change anyone's behavior, she must want to change. Of course, this is just my opinion and in the end, you should do what you think is best.|`|B53KDVuJaa	Tell her that her behavior is worrying you. If she continues on with the drinking anyway, she'll probably do something stupid and have to learn her lesson the hard way.|`|DoR81lgaaa	tell her you want to help her but dont go to her parents! im 13 too and my friend knocked up one of my other friends! and hes gottin caught smokin weed!! but that dont meen i do  ethier|`|62e9ba78ee48eedceb41743f5846f0a9aa	Im 16 so just a few years older than you.  But I think you should let your friend start to spread her our wings, try new things.  Even if those things arn't best for her, you don't want to be a pushy friend.  The drinking isn't great, I say if she keeps it up for a longggg time && she gets drunk to the point to where she doesn't kno anything, then talk to her, then tell her parents if it still doesn't change.  But teenagers in public schools lie to sound cool & older, so she could just be lieing.  The swearing, in a public school it some what grows on you, theres not much you can do if she doesn't want to change that.  Just watch out for her like a good friend, and if it gets to out of control say something to her, your parents, or hers. Just wait it out for a bit tho, everyone learns in their own ways.|`|0jt4eX61aa	The best thing to do I think would be to keep in touch with her and do your best to...well..be yourself. Just be a good image and show how religion has positively influenced your life. It IS the people that she is hanging out with but sadly there isn't anything major you can do about it.|`|8ikoMg7yaa	I see you don't want to lose a friend. I understand. Well it seems to me that you should invite your friend over and well talk it out. Say something for example. These friends of yours what are their names again? Then bring up your worries and say it in a calm voice with no yelling. If she listens to you wonderful, maybe she can change. But if not it's her lose, not yours.|`|TlSUgrU3aa	if you dont want to tell on her then you should talk to her and tell her how it makes you feel maybe she will get the picture|`|HsPZvRAoaa	u have to tell someone <br>  goto someoneu no u can trust but dont give any names|`|oYqKiocLaa	I think you should talk to your friend about in a nice way. Don't get mad about it but let her know how you feel about it
qWP7orGnaa	yes... duh<br>  if shes hot just have one night with her...it wont hurt anybody if she never reveals it to anyone|`|DP6UkhXjaa	hahahah nice lie|`|t6IilLfNaa	Even though that story is very unlikely. Ask yourself this question, would you want your friend to have sexual relations with your mother?|`|YSQQGO98aa	first off what she is doing is immoral.........how can you even consider it???  on top of the fact that she is married and also your friends mom.  what would your friend think knowing his mom had an affair with one of his good friends???? How would you feel if someone did it to you.  I would let her know that what she is doing is immoral as well.  why does she have an interest in kids???? think about it!!!|`|ZO2qVAyMaa	haha duuum|`|5HgTTHDwaa	jst **** er!
fQUUG68Iaa	hmm... That's a tough one..<br>  It can go either way.<br>  It seems he is intrested but undecided.<br>  So you shoud just lay low and dont be to pushy.<br>  Unless he likes that then you can ask HIM.
6XoOiPY8aa	Why yes, I do. But then again, there are approx. 417 people in the US with that same name. So I'm sure many other people know one too.|`|7d8b092b0508a647a38976703a57cc4faa	it's a common name..<br>  i have a friend name veronique hernandez<br>  good luck finding her(:
lvOR401haa	Hey - congratulations!!! :-)<br>  <br>  There are no rules - do what you like! That's the good part of it!<br>  <br>  For me, my fiancee proposed without a ring, and is getting me one after.  What he doesn't know is that I have also got him a ring too ;-).  I think it's going to be soon he gives it to me, and I'll give him his at the same time.  I don't mind if he doesn't wear it - it's a token more than anything.  I would be happy if he wore it on a chain if he wasn't keen on as a ring.<br>  <br>  Typically men don't get them, but that doesn't mean that you can't get one.  I just got my man a simply band with engraving inside - a lil message :-)<br>  <br>  You can buy 'sets' that have both engagement ring and wedding band together, so they fit and look like a set. <br>    <br>  But you can get them separately too - though they are set high enough for bands to sit under - in the most part.  Weird shapes may require a ring to be made to fit.<br>  <br>  I have put some sites below - have a look and see what the different styles are like (they do sets too).<br>  <br>  www.bluenile.com<br>  <br>  www.adiamor.com<br>  <br>  www.jpdiamonds.co.uk<br>  <br>  Congrats and have fun chosing rings :-)<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL -<br>  <br>  As well as silver bands, you may want to look at titanium, tungsten or zirconium rings.  These are generally really tough and durable metals which will 'last longer' than silver, but for similar price.  I got my friend a titanium ring 4 years ago and it looks new, and the FH's ring is titanium too as I didn't want to spend too much not knowing if he'll want to wear it or not.  It cost me ￡30, plus ￡11 for engraving.  Silver will show signs of wear faster, but some people prefer the look of it to the others.  Just a little more info - it'll depend on your budget.  I suggest buying online and having the ring engraved by the same company so you have come back if they engrave it badly.  You get more for your money online - just make sure you have his ring size before having the band engraved - the company I used in the UK gave you the option of returning for engraving after sale to ensure it fit.|`|DyuXD9Evaa	well traditionally only the woman is given the engagment ring...but in recent days guys have been given engagment rings...i know this because when i went looking for rings with my fiancee the people there tried desperately to make us buy one for me...let me ask you is your fiance more "manly" or would he not mind having a ring with a few diamonds in it...cuz while if you want to get him one you can choose the ring you want for him the ones that are categorized as male engagement rings are diamond encrusted...yeah i know its kinda feminine...<br>  <br>  but when you get married its completely up to you if you want to buy an entire other ring for you...i kmow married women who have two rings and i know some who have just the one...you can just take off your engagement ring and put it back on in the ceremony...i know a lot of jewelry stores try to sell you rings that come together to make one...like you have the engagment ring then you put on the other one when you get married and it fits in like right under the diamond...in my opinion its a waste of money but your the woman so if you want both im sure you can get both but your getting married i wouldnt take that approach...<br>  good luck|`|4lL34wJnaa	I had friends who both wore engagement rings.  She had a small solitaire and he wore a gold ring with onyx and a small diamond in it.<br>  <br>  When you actually get married, for just the ceremony you wear your engagement ring on your right hand.  Your future husband will be placing your wedding band on your left hand.  Once that ring is in place, you can wear your engagement ring on your left hand as well, but make sure your wedding band is closest to your heart and always put it on first.  Some brides choose to have their rings welded together so make it easier.  <br>  As for him, usually the guy if he has a na engagement ring would stop wearing it on the wedding day and you will place the wedding band on his left hand and he will wear that ring there instead of the engagement ring.  Although I suppose he could wear the engagement ring on his right hand from the ceremony onward if he wanted to.<br>  <br>  Good luck & Congrats! :-)|`|jkXDhtsQaa	There is really no rule of who gets the ring or what's on the ring.  These rings symbolize your relationship so you can have it anyways you want. <br>  <br>  Traditionally, when a guy wants to ask his girl to marry him..he would go get a ring.  The rule of thumb is the ring has to worth 4 months of his salary...but that's just for fun.  <br>  <br>  After he got you the ring and proposed to you -- that ring became your engagement ring.  You would wear that ring down the everyday afterward and down the isle.   You can also use that ring as your wedding ring as well if you decide not to get a matching wedding band as his. <br>  <br>  About "him." No you don't have to get him an engagement ring.  However, if you want him to wear a ring too after you too are engagement...YES, you can get him the silver band.  That would be nice...And also, i think it's fair.  Why us girls have to wear the ring right after we get engaged and the guys don't have to wear one until they are married. :-) <br>  <br>  As for me...I have my diamond ring "engagment ring" which I wore on our wedding day and on special occasion.  However, I still have a special custom matching wedding band with our names engraved in it as a daily wedding ring that we wear everyday. <br>  <br>  Since my diamond is pretty big; therefore, i find it very inconvenient for me to wear it daily.|`|KpxVsPZSaa	i bought my fiance an engagement ring i told him to choose his ring and i choose mine. i got my rings in a bridal set.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	The traditional way is that the man picks out the engagement ring and proposes. Then you get wedding bands to exchange on your wedding day, which is when the man gets his ring, and you get a band to go with your engagement ring. Some people switch it up though. Do whatever you're comfortable with!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no he doesn't get an engagement ring.  unless you want to be cute and unique and get him one!  but get him something cheap he can chuck in a drawer once you're married so he can put on his official wedding band.  yes when you get married you both get bands.  they don't have to match, yours can go with your ring and his can be plain or whatever.  most engagement rings are sold as a set with the band that fits with it.
LD9R0aBraa	well, if she was your friend...then no way there are plenty of guys out there than to be dating each others men! but since your not friends...forget her who cares! lol be with your man! =D|`|UAF9R4g3aa	First check with the girl. If you WERE friends, you know you couldn't go out with him. But since y'all don't know eachother really well...I guess it would be alright to go out with him.<br>  <br>  2 OPTIONS.<br>  <br>  1. Secretly go out with him<br>  <br>  2.Just flat out tell her you're going to and do it.<br>  <br>  Best Luck to Yhoo!

It gives you a chance to really enjoy your life instead of acting like a trained seal to one person.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Yep, it pretty much counts.....|`|BkMjabPvaa	yeah it still counts but you are stupid you will knock her up <br>  <br>  when you have sex you are basically ready to say "i can be a mommmy and daddy"<br>  <br>  <br>  are you POSITIVE you are ready to be "daddy" ?|`|g7gvzhkpaa	if there's penetration then you had sex ,maybe have it somewhere "quite" even though I think 15 is too young .|`|Sl0UPcheaa	That counts dude. As soon as there's penetration that's sex.|`|xbFhE5Tkaa	Yea you have, how can you get interuppted so much?!|`|CNgVwJgEaa	If it's not sex then what is it?!?!?!<br>  <br>  Of course it's sex. It sounds however, that you don't know enough about it to be taking part in it. A couple of months and 15 years old is disgusting. Adult couples don't have sex until after a few months and ur rushing in after 2?!?!?!<br>  <br>  Please be careful and use contraception!|`|PtSeJXnEaa	you two need to keep your pants on and legs closed. you have sex to reproduce. you cant afford children. wait until youre responsible.<br>  <br>  btw. you had intercourse. so its 3 times.|`|mS1ODTalaa	word of the day HERPES.<br>  <br>  Me and Molly were hungry so we decided to go to a pizzeria.

VmSKQ40Caa	I would say it was an insult, but not a very harsh one at least.|`|8qq2wyFiaa	It was either an immature insult or he was just joking. Did he laugh when he said it? He might have been implying that he was indeed flirting with you :)

pdV8Feafaa	church.|`|cTNM4XIuaa	Honey church. It's hard but if you can find a man who does I'll take him if you don't work out. :]]|`|3IVqoH16aa	If any guy says he doesn't want to get into your pants he's lying.  That being said, wanting to get into your pants and being obsessd with getting into you pants are two different things.  That's the main point.  Don't look for asexuals.  Look for complete people.  Sex and love, at least romantic/erotic love, can't really be separated.  They are two parts of the same thing.<br>  You said that you have fallen for guys who seem to be only interested in sex.  You need to look into this.  Men who want complete relationships are everywhere(I guess you'd find a much lower percentage of them in strip clubs).  But you seem to be singling out the ones who go for just sex. And you can always find them, no matter where you go.  There's something about them that keeps drawing you to them.  Is it familiarity?  The way they dress?  The mixed signals?  The lack of seriousness?<br>  I'm just saying this because I've been through a similar thing.  I had to a lot of fixing of myself.  Who I was attracted to, and who was attracted to me, didn't change until I started to change.  I used to be one of those guys who was only interested in sex.  I substituted sex for intimacy, which was what I really wanted.  But I had many issues with intimacy, so sexualizing women was a safe substitute, but not hardly as satisfyiing as real intimacy.|`|vPjbSBhJaa	You can look in some of the more extreme churches. I'm sure that there are a few there that try to ignore basic biology. Or you can try a local gay bar. Other than that, you will have to settle for a sane, rational, normal man. It is up to you to set the limits of your relationship.<br>  <br>  If you are attractive at all, guys are going to want to mate with you. Get used to it and learn how to handle it.

pVnUhYLQaa	Nope. Guy code. If you do it you need to hand over both your balls and your man card.|`|1XRS9jzpaa	if you know its wrong then dont do it|`|Jwh5enUCaa	No way!! No matter how much oyu like it is wrong. You need to tell her to dumo him if she does no tlike him anymore. CHEATING is wrong and you are jsut as guilty if you know she has a boyfriend and mess with her. Talk to the girl. Tell her as long as she is with your friend you can't be with her. Also there are a lot of girls out there, don't lose your self respect over just one.|`|YSQQGO98aa	if she is your friend then all you can do at this point is tell her your opinion.  let her know what you know about him.  but dont tell her that you are interested in her.  after it all plays out then be her friend and comfort her.  take your time before dating her because you do not want to just be a rebound boyfriend because then it will never work.  if she wants it to happen it will later down the line.  if not then move on and continue to be close friends.|`|LETd2hQwaa	I don't suggest you do it unless you are fully aware and ready to handle the consequences of it. If she wanted out of the relationship, she'd get out. Leave it alone and just continue to be friends with her. Let things flow. Don't be so quick to follow your heart, your heart can't think for it self. It's pretty selfish actually. It just wants what it wants with no remorse for anything else. Follow your mind... your brain.|`|RfAh74uzaa	I think you should tell her how you feel and let her decide for herself if she wants to break up with him. Just by you saying somthing can give her an insentive to dump the creep. :)|`|THezIGOiaa	Don't do it man. You'll look like a jerk. Trust me, everyone supports you now, but when you do it and things go bad, they will be no where to be found.<br>  <br>  Also use more punctuation. Girls find it sexy.|`|u7Ji7BZBaa	Dude, use some damn punctuation in your sentences.|`|VjDseED0aa	tell her to break up with him. or try to get them to break up some other way. iot doesn't sound like a good relationship|`|MSW5vetFaa	no man dont do that. hes ur 'friend" if she lieks u she should dump him

yMAfJngcaa	Hmmmmm maybe you should should just talk with her in class and flirt with her. Maybe she thinks that you don't really like her so she is trying to act like she doesn't like you either. So you really just have to get the nerve to talk to her.

4FCRCCKqaa	unless they tell you or you them what the problem was that drove you to cheat it won't work out. If they do say what the problem was it has a chance if the cheatee tries to fix it. But honestly cheaters will always find something to cheat about, because they get bored easily. It depends on what kinda cheating: kissing good chance of success, sex difficult.|`|JtxT2qZbaa	I'm a skeptic. I really think if he could cheat once, what would stop him from doing it again? <br>  <br>  It's not like he didn't know that he would hurt your feelings the first time. If he did it knowing it'll mess you up, that's pretty heartless. No excuse.|`|2PDtqfgvaa	once a cheater always a cheater isn't true.<br>  my boyfriend used to cheat on allll of his past girlfriends, but he's never once cheated on me and we've been together for a two years.|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	Once a cheater, always a cheater|`|359diMXpaa	i say if he does it once he may do it again.... but it isn't always true... some guys actually get more mature as they get older (hard to belive i know!!)
6xWJJonyaa	my friend was just in the same situation<br>  she didnt tell her parents and just said she was sleeping over at a friends house wen she visited her bf , but eventually her parents found out and they ended up taking him to court and not they cannot contact each other in any way- i dont think its illeagle unless you are sleeping with him- even then hes not 18 yet
ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Well since she has a new boyfriend, don't try to pursue her. Even if they break up, give her time. Let her know you still care about her and are there for her. Just be sweet. If she blows you off, she isn't over the breakup yet and still sees things as awkward between the two of you. Give her time to get back to normal again. Take it slow. You guys will hopefully be friends again soon.|`|2hcA3VP9aa	look the way that you describe yourself is kind of clingy. i think that you should just stop worrying about her because i do not think that she is that concerned over you as you are over her. that might be some of the reason that she broke up with you. i know that you might not want to hear this but it is the truth. it might feel weird for her to be friends with you again because of how the relationship went with both of y'all at the same time. i hope that this helped and good luck with your future relationship problems.
zzaScg0haa	let her be for now
9oiZ6Rmbaa	No.  Never have, nor have I seen man-tears over physical pain.
FiCl71flaa	You have to decide within you the qualities you want in a guy.Which is more important to you:love, caring,honor,sexual attraction,sweet and nice,in short,a guy who is a gem ,a man who would go to any lenghts to  please  you. If you only problems is that he is not good looking. enough for you.,then your choices are to walk away from it all . or to stay with a great guy who adores you but is not good looking. Think about it as you try to find a good perfection.I wish you the best.

kBXCwNT5aa	he doesn't just like her he is obsessed. One easy sign is that he makes sure she is safe and makes sure she is fine every day. Also another tip off is if he starts saying sorry for everything he does next to her. He also takes your jokes to seriously while your not even going out so watch out for your friend because he might be trying to steal your girl|`|BXe211Fvaa	DUH! YEAH HE LIKES HER I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.<br>  and when a guy defends a girl over his guy friend yeah it's pretty obvious. especially the texts...<br>  I mean do you just need to be reassured? well we're assuring you alright.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	His texting her everyday, making sure she arrives safely, would suggest that he has stronger feelings than just friend feelings. Also, the way he said you were an *** because you checked someone else out, would also show that he has strong feelings for her. <br>  If you really want her, you need to make your move. And fast, before your friend does. It sounds like he will, if you don't.<br>  It sounds like he may be more into her than you are, by the way. <br>  If that isn't true, do something about it.
0didTstUaa	well i suppose the easiest route from here would simply be to go to GOOGLE and type in translate english to spanish (be sure its the igoogle translator). that way if you want to change anything you can just type in the new stuff on the google translator, (which as far i can tell is perefectly accurate) that way you dont have to keep asking on here and wasting time and your question amount ;) the literal translation of that is below (a number indicates the line it was on and therfore the line it translates.   <br>  1.Te invitamos a estar con nosotros <br>  2.al comenzar nuestra nueva vida juntos <br>  3.Ashley <br>  4.y <br>  5.JP <br>  6.el domingo, el noveno del mes de agosto <br>  7.dos mil nueve <br>  8.en cinco y media de la tarde <br>  9.Comunidad Católica San José<br>  <br>  as for the address do not translate it as it will become innacurate because the location names and the place itself are not in spanish. but the rest is fine. hope this helped a bit <br>  good day ;)|`|LX7GBNbqaa	Juntos comenzamos nuestra nueva vida <br>  y te quieremos invitar estar con nosotros<br>  Ashley<br>  y<br>  JP<br>  por el Domingo, Augosto nueve<br>  por el medio cinco in el noche<br>  St. Joseph Catholic Community<br>  <br>  This is not a literal translation of what you put up, but it sounds better in Spanish. Here is what I wrote:<br>  Together, we begin our new life, and we want to invite you to be with us.<br>  Ashely and JP<br>  On the Sunday, August 9<br>  at half past five...blah blah blah|`|btNUf7rcaa	The people above did a good job but there were some minor mistakes. I dont like using online translators because they tell you things in the wrong order.<br>  <br>  Te invitamos a compartir con nosotros<br>  ahora que empezamos nuestra nueva vida juntos.<br>  Ashley <br>  y<br>  JP<br>  el Domingo, nueve de agosto<br>  del dos mil nueve<br>  a las cinco y media de la tarde<br>  en St; Joseph Catholic Community (if you want to change the name to spanish as well, it would be : en la comunidad catolica (accent on the "o") San Jose(accent on the e); its probably better to keep it in English tho, since most people will know it by the english name)<br>  <br>  yes address can be in english<br>  <br>  another thing, in the first line, in english "you" can be plural or single. But in spanish "you" is different for plural or single. So, if you want to invite lets say 2 people, it would be:<br>  <br>  "Les invitamos a compartir con nosotros"<br>  <br>  What i said before "Te invitamos a compartir con nosotros" is directed to one person.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions you can email me, i will gladly help.

Now, let him be the adult and do whatever needs to be done.  Tell him what happened and trust in his maturity and good sense.  He will probably want you to talk to a therapist about the fact that whether or not he is a 'boyfriend'-it's still rape.  NO means NO!|`|ItA6oEGCaa	It's hard with teachers, but if that's your confidant, then get it off your chest. If you don't tell someone it will just eat at you until you can't react normally in social situations. Your teachers obviously older, so they've been through more and will have better advice for you. I wouldn't name names, because there may be repercussions with  your boyfriend that could turn out bad.|`|ljIm7fI1aa	It's best to do, theres no one else.Its a nice relief to atlest tell someone and sense hes close to you and if you really trust him do so.|`|U4dHE6Kwaa	Tell him exactly what you told us and how he pinned you down etc!

I'm sure he will understand.<br>  <br>  As for your boyfriend...if he's not going to accept your personal desires / non-desires, then he's not the right guy for you.

If you love him then go on, let him feel how you feel but when time comes that hurt rule over the love you felt, then, its time for you to let go of that person. <br>  <br>  Maybe they are confused because they don't like us to get hurt which is wrong because all we like to know is just them to be honest.|`|ZswJ3toraa	haha i have the same problem<br>  <br>  i really like this guy<br>  hes funny hes nice<br>  <br>  i got some eye contact at lucnch<br>  but then<br>  i found out he had a citrus addiction<br>  and he was looking at me cuz i had an orange<br>  <br>  lmfao|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Yeah, sticking your hand in a running blender just once is never enough, go for it, stick the other hand in there sister.<br>  Go for the gold!|`|HNEW1gzDaa	sometimes a guy will say something he doesnt mean because he doesnt know wat to say or is nervous... if you really like a guy you should tell him even though girls think dats wrong...know guys dont freak out they will ike u more... guys are afraid 2 ask girls out sometimes 2|`|iUDrNbcxaa	is your name rihanna?
3ccD7M04aa	I think a guy has a right to have fun at his bachelor party.  Even though you might not be mad at what he does, he's not going to have as much fun knowing he's going to relay everything he does to you.  You trust enough to marry him, so let him have this one secret ;)<br>  <br>  If you need any help with your Bachelorette party I host free Passion Parties as Bachelorette Party ideas all the time! I can help you get in touch with someone in your exact area too. The parties are free because you're allowing a female Passion Party consultant to show you all of our fun products for women. :) Everyone has so much fun. We play games, maybe have some drinks, and there's no pressure to buy anything. We get joy out of letting women have fun talking about and learning new things about their sexuality. Check out my website to get an idea of what it's like and if you're interested or have any questions, my contact info is there too.<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  Sarah|`|g71m3S9Naa	NO it is not wrong he wont tell you.  He doesn't want to get in trouble for something.<br>  <br>  They are most likely going or having strippers over come to someones house.|`|OauZKhKVaa	I would want to know, but that's just my insecurities talking. I don't see why it should be a big secret.|`|s7aM2mpdaa	I think the reason that he won't tell you is that he obviously thinks that you won't want to know.  And you can probably assume that it has something to do with strippers....<br>  <br>  The question is, are you ok with him going to a strip club or having a stripper come to him, wherever they might be?<br>  <br>  If you are or not, then I would suggest that you ask the best man ( who is probably planning it ).  Do ask for details, you will never get them, especially in this case when they are already being secretive about it.  Tell him up front what you feel about your boyfriend and the strippers, be honest too.  It might be that you can't control it and you will have to accept it.  But don't worry about it and don't read into it too much.  From a guys point of view, it's just entertainment and a little fun and harmless.  That may not be your point of view, but I will bet that it is his.<br>  <br>  It's hard to really tell in your question if you are the bride or not, I am going to assume not.  So if that is the case, then you have even less to worry about... All the focus of any of the strippers ( if that is the plan, and most likely is ) will be on the groom and not your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  I guess you have to trust him.
vqqxD6Teaa	It seems like he is actually a good guy. He cares about you and does not want you to do anything that he think you might not truly be ready for or regret. Take things slow. I know that what happened to you was horrible. Just make sure that you truly know what you want and then talk to him. He may be comfortable with everything or he may not. He just wants to do the right thing. You have to be sure that sex is the right thing for both of you.|`|wqCznap2aa	Here's an honest answer from someone who fully understands what's happening. The guy just wanted to use you for sex, but when he found out that you were raped your first time, he felt bad for you and didn't wanna use you as a sex toy, so he's trying to back out of the relationship.

If they break up, then pursue him, But do NOT break up the relationship, or do anything that might potentially break them up, nor have your immature friends do anything to their relationshihp. <br>  <br>  How would you feel if you were dating that guy and some girl came along and broke you two up, like your friends are telling you to do now? Pretty mad eh? As you already admitted..you wouldn't want to be in his girlfriends position. And if he were to cheat on his girlfriend with you...it means he would also cheat on YOU.<br>  <br>  It isn't worth it, don't pursue him. Keep looking for another guy and if along the way, that guy's relationship ends..then go for it.|`|KjF0p72naa	MOVE ON.

The same way he'd leave her for you he will do the same thing to you. Apparently he doesn't 'like' you enough to leave his girlfriend so what reason is that to break them up in the first place? He likes you but doesn't want to pursue a romantic interest in you because he already has someone. Why pursue someone who isn't pursuing you? Just keep your distance and just let it be. Don't let going after what you can't have get the best of you. Just let him be and don't meddle in people's relationships for your own selfishness.|`|vhKUgf6baa	tell him you're not gonna wait around on him. so he needs to choose. but don't break them up that's immature. and you wouldn't want to be in her place because i have been in that place and it wasn't fun. but if you just let things go the way they want everyone will be with who they are supposed to be with.|`|0cEz1Hibaa	wait till he breaks up with that girl,,,, if he cheats on his current gf and get with you, then there's a high chance he'll cheat on you|`|aZ7RmWrjaa	nooo don't get wit him. if i was you, i wouldn't gonna try to break them up cause it's not fair to the other girl. plus, if he really likes you then he already had break up with the other girl. otherwise, he over here telling ur friend that he likes you alot and other there kissing another girl. it aint worth it for u to break ur heart b/c him . i don't think u deserve that. he aint gonna make no good bf for you. if i was you imma try to get over him

You must be breathing short and feeling your heartbeat rise right? your body is preparing you for the next thing that might happen, if this is your first love make sure that you wait for sometime and observe the other person to see how strongly he loves you or is commited to you, because no girl would want to loose everything for jerks make sure you dont make any mistakes before choosing the right person for the right Moment! enjoy.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ldZxNhlKaa	y does he comes closer to u? pls say that 1st...if he wants to touch or something like that..then u decide 1st that u want that to happen or not..if u really want that he doesnt touch u then say him frankly not to come closer to u...if u want that he comes closer and if u likes it then dont b nervous..in the beginning u will feel nervousness later u wont..i dont know ur age..all this can effect career and life of a person..so think bfore doing nething..now adays peoples uses the person and then leave it..so take care...good luck..|`|8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	That is good: do not allow him too closely: still your marriage is confirmed keep the same distance with him:|`|TMjpWxU5aa	Hey.. dont worry dear..<br>  It happens with me also.. but he makes me feel comfortable..<br>  So just overcome it.. nd enjoy dear..|`|OrS5dlcpaa	It's good for u don't do anything jiske liye baad me aapko gulty feel ho i give u this advice bcz i think u r a good girl and i hope so|`|N8zJERG5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It's nerves.

lNlL0Ag2aa	Definitely true, and I wouldn't say majority but all of them because once a guy gets dumped by the girl, that means that the girl is after someone else and that she's no longer into him. And if he doesn't realize that, then he definitely is desperate and needy.
mW1EcKOPaa	You want to know how? If you want to pursue it, then you should probably have a solid idea on how to do it. <br>  <br>  The facts are:<br>  The intercourse is an erect penis going into a vagina. For both pleasure, and reproduction, the couple will move their hips together in order for the penis to enter deeper and rub inside the vaginal walls. When the male orgasms, he ejaculates semen, which carries sperm in it. If a woman gets incredibly turned on, her clitoris, like the penis, becomes engorged with blood. If the blood isn't released via orgasm, she will experience discomfort -- just as men do.<br>  <br>  That's just the sex part. There's much too many things to list about it.<br>  But I suggest that since you don't know how, you shoudn't do it. If you do, use a condom.|`|lbvE1bMqaa	umm how old are you?|`|ulUBv22eaa	watch porn|`|YSQQGO98aa	well if you have to ask how to have sex then that means your way too young to be having sex.  you need to save yourself for someone that cares about you and doesnt want to just use you.  have a little more respect for yourself and if its attention your needing get a puppy!!!|`|wqCznap2aa	you take your penis and put it in a vagina, a mouth, or a butt.
3y0w1qIBaa	If you value your friendship a lot, then you may want to apologize to them and ask if you can make it up to them.  It could be anything.
hhKJfkciaa	Your a fag.|`|8a3gbCbKaa	Well it could be all three haha. I'm sure she was checkin you out! She probably wants to get to know you more, which may result into a crush. Maybe it might be too soon! Just chill with her in art class and see if you guys click! Then, if you feel that you both are comfortable with each other and that you flirt, ask her to hang out. (:|`|5q7unmZVaa	if a girl comes up and talks to you she's interested ask her out for some coffee or to a diner close buy for a burger. she really like that. if she says no or she gots to do something then she's not interested but, if she's busy but would still like to hang out sometime then she interested also.<br>  - cindy|`|YEzJy0CYaa	you guys can be friends without "going out." most likely she likes you, but it's also likely that she's using you. if so, she's a jerk so don't waste your time.|`|CVNjSzu7aa	I think she thinks your cute :D<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Amwb1CyO.qt1EGI3wmwtf0Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309175814AAA8nIx&show=7#profile-info-CVNjSzu7aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|bHdsvFqQaa	She's into you.|`|sFqsTXvwaa	She likes you.|`|my53ST0Eaa	i  think she likes you|`|pF2CiEpDaa	Firstly, what were her facial expressions?<br>  If she were looking curious, she probably seemed interested.<br>  If she looked almost weird, maybe she finds your size a little strange.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest that if you really like her continue talking to her and plan new conversations to talk about.

eGiLYNlzaa	Just joke around and see if he likes you. Be like "Haha, i love you" or something and laugh and look for his reaction. If he's hesitant then you may be able to determine that he likes you. Or just ask him. But i know how hard it is to ask someone that.

y6gVmhHxaa	I wasn't a virgin and wore white.  I think that tradition is long past.  You don't meet very many wedding day virgins now a days.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	white wedding gowns and virginity is such a misnomer.  Here's a little article about the meaning of the white dress.<br>  <br>  Women Haven't Always Been Marrying in White<br>  In fact, in the grand scheme of things, the tradition isn't even all that old. The white wedding dress of today is deep-seated tradition, and for many is worn to signify virtue as well as uphold tradition. Millions - in fact billions - of women all over the world start thinking about the perfect white wedding gown before they have even found the perfect partner.<br>  <br>  Britain is a place that is rife with traditions and legends, so it is little wonder that the tradition of the white wedding dress was started by the English Monarchy. It was the wedding of Queen Victoria that spawned the interest and popularity of white wedding dresses as we know them today.<br>  <br>  Queen Victoria married Albert of Saxe in 1840, and wore what would then have been considered a flamboyant white gown. Of course, this did not start the tradition immediately; however, many women saw this as a statement of class and style, and copied the Queen by also getting married in white.<br>  <br>  The white wedding dress in those days had nothing to do with being virtuous - it was all about wealth. Getting married in a white, extravagant gown was a sign that you could afford to buy a dress that you would never be able to wear again because of its style and color (whites were not easy to clean in those days as they are today!).<br>  <br>  Of course, women still continued to be married in various colors and styles of dress - it was only the vain and the wealthy that insisted on white to follow in the footsteps of the wealthy Monarch. However, during Edwardian times, the white wedding dress once more soared to new heights of popularity, as Coco Chanel unveiled its new knee-length white wedding dress, complete with extravagant train.<br>  <br>  Even so, with the depression that followed World War I and the approach of World War II, many women continued to make do with whatever type of dress they could afford, and this went on for decades. Some women would marry in simple white dresses, which could then be dyed and used as an everyday dress. Again, it was only the fabulously wealthy that could really afford to splurge on an elaborate gown.<br>  <br>  However, from the 1950s onwards, as the world watched Hollywood stars, royalty and members of high society get wed in stunning white gowns, the tradition of white became signed and sealed.<br>  <br>  Wedding Dresses of Different colors: A Bit of Folklore<br>  As with many other things in life, there is much folklore and legend surrounding the various other colors that brides have been known to wed in. One old rhyme seems to sum up these notions:<br>  <br>  Married in white, you have chosen all right.<br>  Married in green, ashamed to be seen.<br>  Married in red, you will wish yourself dead.<br>  Married in blue, you will always be true.<br>  Married in yellow, ashamed of your fellow.<br>  Married in black, you will wish yourself back.<br>  Married in pink, your spirits will sink. <br>  Of course, most people will think nothing of this poem, apart from the fact that each color has been coupled with a meaning that just happened to rhyme very well. We all know that there are plenty of people that have married in pinks, blues and every other color, and have enjoyed a long and happy marriage. And we certainly know that there are plenty of people that have married in white, who have not prospered quite so well|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  You need to read up on the whole "white wedding dress" history.  Colored dresses were the norm until Queen Victoria's wedding in 18?? (I don't feel like looking it up now), and then after that white dresses were the "rage."  It was more of a status thing (because white material was more costly) NOT a sign of virginity.  Clearly, almost 99.999% of brides today (and for many generations) have worn white as "tradition" NOT as a sign of virginity.|`|R7b150Iyaa	Pug Mom's got it right, white is not a symbol of purity or virginity but of wealth and prosperity. How many people in this day and age are really virgins before they marry?  Go ahead and wear white if it makes you happy.  Although colored gowns are coming back in style now, I am still wearing white because how many times in life do you really get to wear an extravagant white dress?  Although I'm being original by having a bit of purple in my dress.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|55zWUXcUaa	I am wearing white, I am a virgin.  It used to be a symbol of virginity, but with so few people actually being virgins when they get married it just became traditional to wear white.  With know purity symbol behind it.  Actually before white blue was the symbol of purity, times change, wear what you like.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	I'm wearing white (well ivory), i've lived with my fiance for two years, will be almost four when we get married, so i think it's okay, it's not really a thing to gossip about the bride and her choice of wearing white (or not).|`|LCAzlHhEaa	I wore white and wasn't a virgin.  My husband and I lived together too for about 6 months before the wedding|`|884v4VhGaa	Don't worry, wearing white has nothing to do with your past history. Wearing white used to be to show that you had enough money to buy a dress that was impractical. It's a lot less impractical now - we can easily clean it, and we're not living in as much dirt - so white dresses just mean tradition.<br>  <br>  Honestly, no one is going to think nasty things about the bride because she doesn't think that white looks good on her.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	umm, I am divorced with 2 kids but never had a wedding and I'm wearing white when I get married in June! I was going to go with ivory at first but I tried a white one on and it looked so much better with my colors. I don't care what people think!|`|xuiSfzgraa	I have lived with my fiance for almost 2 years, so clearly we have sex, and I am wearing white. I don't think it really matters!  If you want to wear white, wear it!|`|fNAU0OL6aa	actually white originated as the color romans would wear at celebrations, then during the victorian era it was worn as  a status symbol it actually has nothing to do with virginity. I'm wearing white.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I'm wearing white because it is the traditional color to wear and actually has no bearing on virginity.|`|xgLqw3WXaa	i think its a stupid rule. and every one breaks it. <br>  <br>  its none of anyones business anyways! lol wear white!|`|yvq7AtJuaa	That is nobody's business!  Wear what you want.|`|jIN3Tnm9aa	I wore white on both my weddings!!<br>  <br>  When I was 18 I got married in white while being 4 months pregnant! I wore a maternity wedding dress, and yes it was white! I did get a divorce a year later, it's a long story! <br>  <br>  When I got married the second time, I wore a huge white princess gown and my son took me to the alter! <br>  <br>  What I do think is wrong is the veil! If you were a veil over your face that means you a virgin! On my first wedding I didn't even have a veil, on my second one I had a long veil but it wasn't over my face! <br>  <br>  Good Luck congrats on your wedding, go for it girl, wear white!<br>  <br>  ~yoyo|`|u4FIwBNWaa	Wearing white isnt about being a pure virgin . Originally it was because only rich people had money to buy white.  Then it was virginity, and now its about happiness!  Wear white!  Or off white like me!|`|jkXDhtsQaa	I was with my husband 1 1/2 year before we got married -- we made love everyday -- but he still purchased a beautiful white wedding gown for me on our wedding day.

Seriously from experience, freshman year girls are very unreliable and fickle, and most of the ones worth dating are focusing on their studies. Don't waste your time trying to date them like I did!<br>  <br>  If anything, join special interest groups, or meetup.com. Be dedicated to something, anything. It will enrich your life and you'll be 10x more attractive, especially if its charity work. It's not worth going to mixers or bars and standing around.<br>  <br>  Also, non-American girls or older girls are much more accessible. Nothing is more complicated than trying to get in a relationship with an 18 year old American girl. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember whoever you think you are now, you won't have this problem forever. I'm 23 and things have only gotten easier.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, I agree with other people, too much hoodie...you also don't want too many corporate logos...if clothes make the man, you don't wanna be Mr. Nike....its juvenile.
07f7853a89aa3cda6f880c27d1d66e86aa	Things to think about:<br>  <br>  Do you spend more time on the computer or phone than with him? If so, are you really wanting to be in this relationship, or do you just like the idea of it?<br>  <br>  Your brother-like friend is of course into you, they always are, and the only reason he is still there is because he is hoping that someday you will wake up and "see" him for the one who has always been there for you, etc, etc. I know I have been in his shoes. <br>  <br>  The other guy who you know likes you is someone who is going to come between you and your boyfriend eventually if you don't make things clear to him. It's unfair to lead him on, and if you like him more than this boyfriend, then let them both know and be done with this foolishness.<br>  <br>  As for the over attentiveness, if he were playing on the computer or talking to his friends on the phone in the same way you do, while you were with him, would it bother you, or would you want him to focus more on you and your time together?<br>  <br>  If you just don't care enough about him, then be done with this foolishness and be single for a while.<br>  <br>  College is hard enough without having drama added to it...unless of course you are in the theater...but that is neither here nor there.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little. <br>  <br>  Communication and Honesty is always the cure for any misunderstanding, and if you play around with people's emotions, that's when things go bad for everyone involved.<br>  <br>  Edit* Okay I just saw your edits: Wanting a girlfriend not to wear revealing clothing in public is normal, because it is something that declares loudly that you want to see the reaction of other men. Women don't need to dress seductively if they have a man. If they are at the beach then whatever, but at school or elsewhere...not the best way to say "I am not looking at other men because I have you."<br>  <br>  So again..if you really don't care enough about this boyfriend...end this foolishness. <br>  <br>  Now about the sheets, did he know in what state of dress you were under the sheets? In any case, that was uncalled for, tell him "exactly" how that made you feel, again, if you care enough about him to do so, if not, end this foolishness. <br>  <br>  Ok, Take Care and all the best.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	normal.|`|1kIP1q71aa	well he's a little insecure, hes possesive but not OVER possesive, you know? i bet if you talked to him about that, he'll be back to normal. i guess he's starting to feel like your his, you have to tell hhim this and explain it to him.|`|NNv8jhjraa	From experience, I think he's being a little too possessive..|`|724cUk75aa	def possesive<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you can't do this anymore<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  break up<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  save uself<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  source:<br>  <br>  past experience<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  see ya|`|HKkbqlIuaa	No, it's not "normal." However, everyone is different. Different people are more or less possessive and jealous than others. More than likely, this isn't going to change. Therefore, you have to weigh the pros and cons and decide if you want to stay with him. Is the relationship worth having an overly jealous boyfriend? It depends if you have strong feelings for him yet or not. You can talk to him about this, and I am sure he's going to be willing to work on it. However, I wouldn't get your hopes up. Jealousy is VERY DIFFICULT too control.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	Thats possessive very possessive<br>  <br>  My GF has mostly guy friends but i just remember one thing.  They are friends for a reason.|`|PPeQliRzaa	He is REALLY insecure. That's not a good thing at all because he's letting it ruin things for you two. He needs to trust you and stop being so possessive.|`|8NvIh3Rtaa	he is being to protecting trust me|`|jeZ1UJmLaa	Its fine|`|91VcMnnSaa	Well of course, its normal for any to react like that. There is a line though if he gets to ridiculous about it. I use to be in that situation with an ex boyfriend but he was a little crazy when it came to that stuff. As long as he's not on your back 24-7 then its normal. Guys will always feel that even though he is yours there is that tad bit of  insecurity when it comes to other guys. It's kind of like competition with men, but as long as you dont give him any reason to doubt then you are fine. Just nip it in the butt when he jumps on you when you get on FB or when you look at your phone. You absolutely do not in any circumstance, feel obligated that you have to explain yourself when you get on facebook, look at your phone or even answer your phone. Trust is the word and he needs to realize it|`|MMelZoTFaa	Yes too protective and too possessive, Sounds like a jealous type of guy. 5 months is not long, but he should trust you more than that|`|mr4pB3xFaa	yes, its normal.<br>  <br>  my boyfriend acutally says **** you to me, when i get a text from a dude, it's gotten to the point where i just dont talk to dudes anymore really, i used to have alotta good guy friends before me and him started dating, and now that he's all protective, i dont really ever talk to any other guy.<br>  <br>  ha, i love him though, so its worth it (;<br>  <br>  but to help you out, just chill with the dudes for a little bit, and let your lover know he's the one that you love, and are faithfull too.<br>  :] give a heart to heart talk to him;]|`|x4HwY3Nwaa	I think that might be a little bit too possessive.

X6gAFO6daa	That is all you and what your willing to do to achieve that.<br>  I'm in a similar position: 16yrs, shy, quiet, smart, a lot of really social friends, but i can't seem to talk much.<br>  What i did was be more open, It's just impossible for me to wake up one day and even act like I'm some big social queen so what i did is be that person with my friends. It's very easy because they will accept anything you do, i'm close with my whole group now, it's very cool :) good luck.

How long have you guys been together?<br>  <br>  popular ideas..<br>  PS3<br>  throw him a surprise party<br>  take him out for dinner<br>  nice watch<br>  plan a romantic getaway<br>  etc.|`|m3x0TsY6aa	take him to chuckie cheese.<br>  "where a kid can be a kid".
THivEt0Paa	It would be breaking the patient/doctor confidentiality and he wouldn't be able to tell your parents anything. Besides a girl can break her hymn by falling as a child so that wouldn't be the case on that part. IF that was to happen, you can look at your parents and say that it isn't any of their business to who you have relations with. You are at that point older then most teens having sex now days.|`|KpxVsPZSaa	the doctor wouldn't know if you are a virgin or not unless you had told the doctor you had sex then it's a different story.....|`|dioPrRFjaa	if you were old enough to be having sex why would your parents still be coming in the doctors with you??
zzUgYFy4aa	contact a lawyer!!!<br>  <br>  no he is not the father just because he signed a piece of paper<br>  <br>  he has no rights if he is not her real dad<br>  <br>  ask your lawyer about custody<br>  <br>  ask your lawyer about the house

She did you a favor.|`|7FIcTB0Uaa	Work on your maturity level first, honestly.|`|wLp2hdlcaa	yeah no wonder why he left you HA HA!!!!|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I doubt she STOLE him. He left you because he didn't like you. Deal with it and stop being so jealous and selfish.|`|70At0HClaa	revengenge is a dish best served cold meaning bide your time you will see your day with both cos chick can't steal your guy if he don't wanna be stolen and you don't wanna get bad karma so take the high ground if it happened with you it will happen with her and then she will know how it feels, and he will end up a cropper so you will be the winner as you will probably be with someone great and not care what ex up to and he will wish he had not cheated and want you.mwhahahaha

ijZmJXggaa	my first kiss came when i was too nervous to make a move, and my gf at the time (or she became my gf soon after) was hanging out with me in her basement away from her parents. we're joking around, flirting, and having a good time together. then we started a kinda lame pillow fight (yea actually really lame haha) but it was cute.  she then proceeded to shove me jokingly, and then i shoved back, so she pushed me onto the ground and climbed on top of me.  i looked up at her, she smiled, and leaned in.<br>  <br>  if thats not a good way to have a first kiss, i dont know what is, but it was awesome haha|`|iSQkOotZaa	haha ive been there with the tall part. try sitting down and pulling his face down to meet yours.|`|7LRPvZkhaa	well if you have like a school dance coming up you could try to make a move if your like dancing with him or something. if you like him you should start hanging out with him even if its like in the hallway or something
vYeS5mYnaa	she sounds like no friend of yours at all|`|g7gvzhkpaa	say I better not walk by you or I'll pop that jealous bubble of yours .|`|ZMk1GDPoaa	Shes gay and making fun of you.

GrCj35muaa	well, where you are already separated a lot of the time, it wont be all that different except you can't call him. you have to wait for his calls. bbut you can email, write, get a webcam if you don't have one already, and just keep living your life. go to work and try to save some money so you know that you can see him when he gets home. try not to sit on the couch and watch women's entertainment with your laptop checking every so often if he's replied... cause that's what I do and it's sad and it sucks and it's more depressing then him being gone. You will do fine. but don't think too much about it now because you will have his entire deployment time to think about what to do.

Especially those that say they're waiting until marriage and then do everything physically they can "get away with" and still claim to be a virgin.|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	it means you've never had sex|`|AMqfcWw2aa	lol.... a virgin is when you never had sex with the opposite gender|`|KpxVsPZSaa	a virgin is when a person hasn't had sex.
h9DKIMQPaa	he thinks you're weird.|`|8qbM2j16aa	he maybe isnt used to expressing his feelings for you in publice some guys it takes time>so jus give him a hug in class or hold hands in the hallway><little things so he can start getting used to you and be more comfortable with your relationship>|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	When someone changes, there is usually a very good reason. I hate to say it, but NO guy who REALLY likes a girl is going to settle for a high five, or hardly talk to her. There is something going on and you better not ignore it. Have a TALK as soon as possible and find out what has happened. When guys start to distance themselves it means they are losing interest, or have their eyes on another girl. <br>   You don't give enough information to be able to tell you what might be wrong with your relationship, but something has Definitely changed and you need to find out what, why and how to fix it.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	You should talk to him, it sounds like he is growing apart from you.|`|aiRn2lQGaa	i think the spark he saw in your relationship is gone for him. sorry hun but it looks like it's over|`|xid6BU3saa	He is being distant. He may be cheating, or ready to break up.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	too much talking.|`|yE47T2BVaa	well i have had the same problem with my boyfriend and i think it is time to talk to him about because i think he might like someone else and not you no more... he might just like you as a friend and i know how it feel and it sucks but that is how life is no matter what. but i am not tryin to make this look bad but you really need to find out what is going on and why he is acting like that and make sure you guys talk face to face because you can tell in there eyes if they are lying or not|`|mr4pB3xFaa	he might want you to break up with him, he might be ignoring you just so you can say that yall are getting too distant and you dont likeit, maybe he's waiting for a fight so it'll be over or something.<br>  <br>  my opinion is to have a heart to heart with him, and REALLY tell him how you feel, and ask him what he wants to do with yalls relationship.<br>  because its in jeopardy.|`|1jltjtjSaa	i think you should break up. sounds like he just wants to be friends. if he really likes you he will definetaly know by that. see how things go. just say 'i still like you, but i think we should be friends for a while and see how things go" saves you the time and the heart break of later on. <br>  <br>  luck!|`|oYqKiocLaa	I think he's starting to see you as more of a friend than a girlfriend... If you don't like him anymore then break up with him. But if you do then you should try to talk to him about it|`|2c88J3M7aa	Hmm... talk to him about it and if things dont work out then maybe you guys should be what you act like - just friends (:<br>  Good Luck ?|`|rRROjCHdaa	sounds like he's young and not ready for a real relationship|`|kpOhopALaa	i would force a conversation lol|`|1bf3dea933e361755cf2ead050fe0e7faa	sounds like he's  backing off, perhaps he feels the relationship is moving to quickly.The question is what happened last week that changed the way he connects with you?If you really care about this person-it's time for a sit down talk to discover what's going on.If he is aloof with you-then it is probably time to move on|`|jWpyDY1Xaa	your young and see eachother too much... i say stand off a bit then he will be chasing you down... give him the cold shoulder for a week. believe me he will react|`|DkScpJN8aa	Keep trying to talk to him xxxx|`|DgmTcvBaaa	how old are you?|`|FrOQ9pL0aa	ask him wats up. hes cheating on u
UAF9R4g3aa	me|`|btNoRiPWaa	Kicking guys in the balls isnt what you do when your angry... And there is no special way.... Thats just immature. how would you like if a guy kicked you in the vag whenever you bothered him|`|wEtoAxhCaa	u listen here u lil bltch u better be glad u didnt try to kick me in the nuts or i woulda knocked ur ***** *** into ur gotdamn place thats ****** cheap u want a size 14 in ur goddam vagina to see how it feels ***** now go give that guy some noggin and tell him ur sorry
g71m3S9Naa	To most it does not.  <br>  <br>  What you hear are the few that it does.  It drowns out everything else.  It only takes one bad apple to ruin everything.<br>  <br>  Think about this,  once you wear out a hole you need to keep going bigger and bigger.  Do you really want to be going it that hole if it is all worn out?   No I didn't think so.<br>  <br>  The perception of big is better is not really so true.  If you pull out a great big 12" hog most women are going to ask you "where you think you going to put that?"   The average penis is only 5".  Think about how they get averages.  Add everything up and divide by how many you got.   Some of those guys had to be smaller than 5 and some had to be bigger than 5"<br>  <br>  Most young girls don't even look so they really don't know what size they like.  they only know if it feels good.  <br>  <br>  The womans "G" spot is only two inches in and in an upward area.  Your penise doesn't even touch that area while having sex.  <br>  <br>  Most guys want a bigger man organ but unless you have the extremely small one then dont worry about it.  Remember 5" is average.|`|n30fNgLRaa	well like... no, unless if its crazy small or big then you have a problem but like i doubt its like that if someone will leave you cuz of it then they are the problem it wouldn't have mattered on the size and you wouldn't last no matter your size if you love someone are you gonna leave her cuz of her boobs? no. but i think the only one it matters to is you, you are just self conscious.<br>  <br>  be confident|`|G28zYbLCaa	yeah..<br>  sadly, if it's too big or too small, that is no good.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Personally, no.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	hahaha humm it shouldn't I don't think guys really care if a girl has big or small boobs?|`|94c983eed26f9fffeb52827bce2a933baa	Absoutely not !!|`|MMIrGwDAaa	no not really if ur saying ppl.|`|kAX9xBmkaa	no!!|`|masYIMRWaa	I agree with CNR. I don't care if a girl has small or big boops.<br>  Who cares ?. Most women don't care about a man's size.<br>  Each person has his/her own choices.|`|422V8LC1aa	as long itz bigger than 2.5 inch...itz ok....bcos scintifically there z no sense in the vegina after that|`|rJOuo24saa	depends  too small is a shame|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Does size matter  - why worry now?  Worry when you can't use it any more.  That is when you have to really worry about it.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	No,but it really depends on how you use it.|`|HlXrHd52aa	Yeah....I hope this doesn't make you sad!  Now, if you are small...but know what you are doing...you won't disappoint!  But on the flip...just because you are big...you still need to know what you are doing!|`|AA10481071	I think it does,  but I think a girl can deal with not having it big, if you know how to use it.|`|OUo9J4i1aa	Those girls just say that if they pulled out a big penis I guarantee you most would run.|`|qcvjUgHzaa	Nope
OFquJwUkaa	When people like you & you don't know what to do, start considering things. Consider what you can do. Consider how much blessed you are compared to others. Consider what time is it. Consider anything, but please don't despair.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

My sister has a child from a previous relationship, that 'father' has NEVER been in her sons life. BUT! My parents have been, and they pretty much raised the kid until he was 9 years old, then my sister got married and decided she wanted her son, so my parents sent him to be with his mom ( my sister) now her new husband is trying to be a father to him, which I think it GREAT!! But my parents are having a hard time allowing him to be a father to the child, it causes problems all the time.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I don't think it's because they don't like her husband, or anything like that, I think it's because they feel threatend by him stepping in and 'taking over' so to speak, on their job. Because they raised him. <br>  My sister is dealing with this every day!! She's has gotten to the point to where she's almost ready to cut my parents out of her life. My parents are good to her son, the only bad thing they do is tell her son that this new man, my sisters husband, is not his real dad, so he doesn't have to listen to what he tells him to do. So that causes problems when it comes to the kid listening to the new dad ( step dad) cause he acts out, then say's   "your not my dad"!! <br>  <br>  At first my sister didn't stick up for her husband, she has just started to recently, and I have to say it's getting a little better. Because she told my parents that if they don't stop she will cut her son out of their lives. Now the issues havent stopped completely, but it has gotten better. I think you need to express to your husband how you feel, and that you are at your breaking point and if he can't be a team with you, then you have to walk away from all this so that him and his family can do as they deem fit for these 2 kids. <br>  <br>  I'm sure you are a  great person, I think any person who is willing to love another child as if it were there own, is an awesome person. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers for this to all work out.|`|0AShsMsoaa	i cant do your math.  you have been with him 8 years but he has an 8 and a 9 year old that arent yours and you have been raising these kids since you were 17 which means you are 21 now and met your husband when he was old enuf to have a one year old, and you were 13.  right?  <br>  <br>  he wasnt looking for a wife, silly, he was looking for a babysitter!!!!!!|`|bMbFw8dwaa	When you tired of the pain, you will make a move. Until then, it is what it is.  Good luck and Godspeed.|`|gSdSRceRaa	Set your husband down and very calmly tell him that he either supports you so that the two of you speak with one united voice, or you are leaving. His children are the way they are because he doesn't want to deal with it. HE needs to make sure his children understand that what you say is law. If none of that happens, be true to yourself and get out. Find a man who will support you. Fact is, long after the kids are gone, it will be just you and him and so his first priority should be to you.|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	The most obvious thing in your letter is something you don't say.......not once do you say that you Love your hubby. You better decide if you love this man and if you want to save your marriage. You are facing a tough situation, and how it turns out depends on how much your husband is willing to change. He is going to have to treat you like a wife and not a babysitter, he is going to have to place YOU above his family and children. He is going to have to RESPECT you and treat you like a woman he Loves. He is going to need counseling (marriage and relationship). <br>    Just bear in mind that you are not the one at fault, this man took advantage of a young, naive girl, and you didn't know any better. If he does not agree to change then prepare yourself for divorce. No one should be in a marriage that is one sided, and makes you feel like a servant......you deserve better, and it is time you asserted your Right to Happiness.|`|09k5GLLkaa	You will figure this out soon enough. All the answers here will just confuse you even more. When you have had enough of your ignorant husband and his crybaby children, then you will know what it is that you want. Life is way to precious and short to deal with such crap as what your husband has given to you to handle. You should live your life as you would want to live it. They are his children, let him raise them. (smile)|`|lckgvz2laa	Put yourself first.. What is it you really want to do? Decide, then do it.|`|50c48696b7488dc525798f3a4b51347daa	There are two tasks that need to be done before a person decides to leave.  First the person deciding to leave needs to grieve the loss of what that person wanted out of the relationship.  The ideal, the dream, or what once was and now is no more.  That person needs to go all the way through the grieving process including the five stages of grief which usually takes about a year.  <br>  The five stages will be listed here because if you are thinking of leaving, it will give you an idea of how far you are in grieving.  <br>  1.  Denial - I can't believe this is as bad as it is.  He or she will get better.  There is still hope for this relationship.<br>  2.  Anger - It is all my partner's fault.  That person is the one that is in the wrong.  Why me?<br>  3.  Bargaining - If only this would have happened or that would be different or if we could get help or if that would have worked.  This is the working through understanding what went wrong in the relationship.  Was it about me or the other person?  Is there any way of salvaging it?<br>  4.  Guilt - It is all my fault.  I am the one that allowed this to happen.  I am the one that made all of the mistakes.  I am the one that is wrong.<br>  5.   Acceptance - This is when you can say to yourself it is over and it no longer hurts to say it.  This is when it becomes a relief to leave your partner because you know without a doubt that it is over.  <br>  Each of these stages have a purpose in understanding why the relationship failed.  Each needs to be gone through.<br>  The second task is to feel that you have done everything you could to salvage the relationship.  While most of this is done in the bargaining phase, in the end it needs to be part of the acceptance that you have tried everything and nothing has worked.  It does not matter what these things are, they are unique to the individual and the relationship.  It just matters that you have tried several things and none have worked.<br>  Also consider the miserable factor. What percentage of the time are you miserable? The higher the percentage the more likely you will want to get out of the relationship.

QPp7zQQpaa	We've always had just one tv set and it broke. Those were the most wonderful days we have had yet. We played board games, we did charades but the time we are most fond of is when we went camping. None of us had done it before, so you can imagine. We went to a field (no bathrooms near) and put up a camping tent. Set the fire and roasted marshmallows, told scary tales, sang, slept till we woke up freezing early in the morning, fished our breakfast, went to the bathroom "al fresco".... you can imagine. It was a blast.|`|D8HsSpVzaa	Go on a day trip or to a caravan park for a weekend with no technology ie. tv radio ipod etc. <br>  just a mobile for emergencies. and do little things through the day like putt-putt golf or the zoo im 16 and we have a week in october every year that we go to a caravan perk and we have a great time.<br>  or go to somewhere in the city you live in and do something new ie.

If both answers are no and you're just thinking that, then you should go out with him. If you're positively in love with that guy, you should give it a chance. It doesn't matter if your friend likes him. She might get over it. <br>  If you answer both of the questions yes, well its better to let it go because they're both in love with each other, and if there's a third person, someone will definitely get hurt.

VohF6t0Vaa	I was in the exact situation man, my best freinds girl was beast and nowbody liked her.... I always told my freind she was a crazy hoe but he was like naw man, it aint like that. She new i didnt like her so she avoided hanging wen i was there. This one time they broke up and she called me asking about my freind and i was like... look sluut, hes been doing just fine with out you so lets keep it that way... that pretty much sealed the hate between us. hahaha<br>  <br>  but just be honest with your friend, if your true friends hell understand and respect your opinion about her... but just stay away from her cuz you being nice and stuff to her makes you a 2 face also... ya know, no offense but just saying.<br>  <br>  but in the end my freind broke up with her and everything is cool again, now he doesnt like the girl that im interested in hahaha .... but thats another story...<br>  <br>  Good luck
MtQ9ea2Uaa	Don't tell him. It'd be really nice of you to let him know what his girlfriend is saying but it wasn't very nice of him to dump you. Let him find this out for himself.

ZxKLOqAlaa	I'm not sure whats up with him. Just leave him alone (not forget about him) for a few days. Make him think you don't mind that he's not talking to you.

3IQq3FPSaa	I'm pretty sure he'll ask about you for two reasons. 1. He likes you obviously. 2. He's used to seeing you at church. I don't think he'll tell your aunt that he thinks that you're cute in church. Depending on how comfortable he is with your aunt, he may let her know that he's interested. If you're interested in him, exchange numbers or email addresses or something to that extent.

Vv7a31pmaa	yes.|`|KasFZL7laa	it didn't really hurt me but it depends on the size of his penis and how turned on you are before you have sex.  just do a lot of foreplay and maybe even have a bottle of lube nearby just in case.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Sure it hurts.Especially when you end up pregnant, and getting dumped and you only had sex the one time.Chances are you won't marry this guy,and after you break up, you'll have a bad reputation.All the guys will want to date you because they will see you as "easy sex".<br>  By the way,howmany of your b/fs ex girl friends were virgins and how many of them did he marry?<br>  I bet he told them everything he has told you about "how special you are","I love you" etc.<br>  Go ahead and have sex.You have everything to lose and maybe an orgasm or two to gain hon.<br>  Just remember:<br>  Sex makes babies<br>  ALL birth control has a failure rate and condoms do not protect against getting used for sex and dumpred regardless of whether you get pregnant or not<br>  It takes a LOT longer to get to know someone than it does to get knocked up.|`|b4Ha48Avaa	lololol.<br>  i asked this question a couple days ago for the same reason.<br>  <br>  make him be on toppp, it'll be painful, but not AS badd.<br>  && uhmm, it's supposed to hurt the first two or three times.<br>  but the first is the worst.<br>  <br>  And, everyone described it as a good feeling of pain?<br>  like, "it hurts sooo good" for the third or fourth time..<br>  and probably the others.|`|JblWZcbbaa	I've only heard yes from anyone I've ever talked to.<br>  It did for my girlfriend, but she got through it.

Unless you partner is little.  Even if he is average size it is going to hurt.   You will most likely bleed and he might tear you a little.<br>  <br>  Just a suggestion,  go get yourself a vibrator.  Not something that is real big.  It should be a smooth one.  Use it on yourself to help open you up some.  Touch the tip of your index finger and the tip of your thumb.  That is about how big of a vibrator you would want to get.  This is going to be close to the size of the penis that is going to go in you. <br>  <br>  Get yourself some KY jelly to help with him getting in.  He has to also understand that he just can not pound you from the start.   <br>  <br>  Take it slow and easy the first couple times or until it starts to feel good.|`|iBJmQ7MWaa	Yes it will hurt if your really nervous<br>  make sure he does some foreplay(oral, finger, whatever foreplay) on you to get you going before he tries to put it in.<br>  You have to be wet down there for it to be less painful, so if your nervous that will show so try as much as possible not to get nervous or it will really hurt, and if you do some foreplay before things will get going faster. usually its better for guy to be on top for it to hurt less, tell him to go slow rushing it in will not help. make sure to use a condom or get on birthcontrol (both is best). umm try and have fun dont feel like ur doing it wrong its your first time so he will be undertanding if you dont know what your doing..just dont be nervous and just laugh off anything that goes wrong , it'll help<br>  <br>  good luck with all & stay protected|`|h7W0q7Ivaa	yea it hurts<br>  <br>  please answer my question<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AixFsJS9Yx_u7mxs01UykNTD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309164642AAb0SO6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|hGWhzfFqaa	It'll sting a little no matter what but to help have him finger you before.|`|CzIaAnsraa	Not if your a guy, ho.|`|8dnwrn1Vaa	Take an Advil before.

I'm asian and my boyfriend's black.. well, let's just say it wasn't very fun for me :(|`|gfmTgLDKaa	Yes, it will hurt, you might start bleeding as well. You see since it hasn't been entered in to before your vagina needs time to get used to it. The first time is the worst, the rest will be enjoyable.<br>  <br>  You see the vagina has to be broken and adjusted to your boyfriend, so it's natural if you bleed or anything. <br>  <br>  Don't sweat it, after the first time you'll be fine. :D<br>  <br>  Pray your boyfriend isn't loaded with a 12 incher if you know what I mean. Because, people say the bigger the better, not really, The bigger the more pain the woman will get. After all, the senses you feel, the good ones, are emitted from the clitoris, and you do not need a very big penis to have a fun time.<br>  <br>  Enjoy, and Good Luck! Don't sweat about it too much!<br>  P.S.: Take it slow, don't rush in to it, since you are a virgin!|`|Y53xwCmbaa	Well I'm 13 and i had sex for the first time last year and i was so scared that i would hurt really bad but even though it does hurt it kind of digs in to the pleasure of it all that pain trust me you'll enjoy yourself haha but make sure your protecting but i mean oviously you know that but i quote from the song I Love College by Asher Roth "Don't have sex if she'd too gone, when it come to condoms put two on"|`|62e9ba78ee48eedceb41743f5846f0a9aa	My first time was over the summer, and yea it does hurt. It hurt me alot, but my ex was big, so i was in pain.  I think you should try to be veryy relaxed before you try.  Have him finger you so ur wet first & you kno you want it.  But if your to tight and he can't get in, and ur hurting, i think you should wait a while longer before you do, you want to be so relaxed with him.  Once you find someone you are relaxed with, it should go in easy & not hurt at all.  && Remember to use a condom, lubricated one might help him get in easier & hurt you less. Always play safe & good luck =)|`|AEFF9fzAaa	There are a lot of factors involved. First have you messed around a lot? If he has fingered you a lot with two or more fingers that will make it easier. Second do you get very wet when you are excited? The hardest thing to get past with virgins, is that they get nervous and wont get wet. If you have trouble getting wet some lube would be good to have on hand. Third you need to relax, if you don't relax you will tighten up and that will make it very hard for him to get it in. And lastly make sure this is the guy you want to sleep with. Good luck!|`|GKSlikxJaa	yes it does trust me it stings because you vagina is adjusting to his penis and it is transporting the sperm in to your vaginal but if you wet it it wont hurt an much<br>  <br>  Tip: if you scared that it will hurt do doggy style and if you dont know what that is it is him inserting his penis up your bum|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	For me it did hurt a little, but I was so scared that my fear outweighed the pain. So most people feel like "this is it?" the first time. It gets much better with practice!!! Maybe try doing it in the shower so he is wet & in case you bleed a little. Make 100% sure you are doing this for you & not him.|`|TlSUgrU3aa	well im 19 and i lost mine at the age of 14 but i know what your up against just breath deep relax and never ever try to close your legs it will hurt you more it hurts a lil the first time but the more you do it the more your biody gets use to it|`|qCgfcu6uaa	well i'm 15 and i had sex like 10 times and it didn't hurt the first time but you have to relax or he could get stuck just have fun and it should go well make sure you where a condom|`|AA10126871	Yes.|`|JjsArGujaa	this makes me curious too. haha<br>  i heard it hurts the first few times.|`|qkUnVwR1aa	vergin to|`|qhPdnzmIaa	no not if he has a tiny widdler|`|aCqz2UE3aa	IT HURTS LIKE A *****!!!!

She obviously has napolean syndrome right now (eventhough its normal for people your age to be that short...I was). Napolean syndrome is when somebody who is really short tries to draw a lot of attention to themselves, either by being obnoxious or mean. She is being mean because she is probably secretly scared of you. Just show her whose boss and dont let that little twerp bring you down. And yes you should go to the teacher that is trying to help you.|`|76iRnYmiaa	i have had the same problem like this in gr.5. well what i suggest you to do is either <br>  <br>  - ignore her<br>  <br>  - go to the teacher you were talking about <br>  <br>  - have a conservation with her. ask her why she is mean <br>  <br>  - talk with you parents <br>  <br>  - try to not be near her .<br>  <br>  - stay with your friends alot so the bigger the group the more she's weaker. <br>  <br>  for example :  if you and some friends stand up with you she may stop|`|tCtcbF4taa	talk to your councelor, anfd have a meeting with her and the other kid.

And he actually proved it to you. So if you can't handle him having other women then cut the strings. Pretty simple.|`|mQg5SVQXaa	You are right to feel hurt.  He says one thing and does another.

The only worst thing that can happen is that he tells you no.  <br>  <br>  Go try, <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|2P2K0rl2aa	I mean only to be kind - you are such a glutton for punishment, with very little self respect.

I prefer a guy that is able to be nice to most people and is at least a little confident.|`|QVY9Fnpoaa	It depends how young a girl is. If she is really young, like in her tweens to late teens, she will be going for looks. Early 20's to mid 20's she still might be going for looks but is already appreciating personality. As women grow older, they often think they have less options than they were young so their standards get lower-- and ultimately will just go for personality. But if you can have both, why not?|`|QFEbDUTAaa	i thought that i'd go for both but since i met this guy i changed my mind. he is not what i would call good looking nor is he smarter than me, but he has amazing personalities, he is caring and really gentle, he makes me feel special, sometime he ignores me i hated being ignored i thought i hated him but when he is nice to me i forget everything else.. so girls dont go just for look..|`|U3lxRnjnaa	As a teenager, gals tends to go for looks more than personaiilty.

The answer is divorce.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Divorce is not an easy process, but I think many people think it's easier than dealing with their problems. And I think it is often a cop-out instead of actually working through things.<br>  <br>  There may be times where divorce is the best option...but I think it should be more of a last resort and less of an instant solution.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Divorce can make some of the problems disappear, at least the problems created by the other spouse and for which that spouse will do nothing about.  Particularly when the spouse is engaging in harmful behaviors and there is a child in the home.  Which is why I divorced my ex.  And felt like 180 pounds got taken from my shoulders.  That was 10 years ago and I've had no reason to think I made the wrong decision, either.|`|nZXJrAAjaa	Here are the common reasons why people get a divorce or decide to divorce.<br>  <br>  Infidelity<br>  Communication Breakdown<br>  Physical, Psychological, or Emotional Abuse<br>  Financial Issues<br>  Sexual Incompatibility<br>  Boredom<br>  Religious and Cultural Strains<br>  Child Rearing<br>  Addiction<br>  Differences in Priorities and Expectations|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	No Marriage, no problem.

Not every one will visit a counselor and counseling will sometimes lead you to the realization that you are not compatible.|`|gSdSRceRaa	Divorce is the easy way out. You fell in love with your husband for a reason. That reason is still there. Odds are though, that it has gotten buried in all of the day to day crap that fills out lives. I find that if people would put the same energy into saving their marriages that they do into breaking them up, most would work themselves out !<br>  Start taking walks together and just talking. About anything at all. Reminisce about when you dated, your wedding, all the good times. One step at a time, the problems will work themselves out.|`|AA10408380	No. U have to work on ur half of the problem, otherwise, when u enter into another union, the same problems will be there. But if u want the problems to subside for a bit, and u guys don't want to work it out for certain, then yes, divorce is the best option. It's all a situational thing. IF ur divorcing over little things, chances are it can be worked out, and should be, but it takes effort from both parties. But if the issues are bigger, then maybe u should think again about saving the marriage. Like, if ur gonna divorce over him not doing his share around the house, that can be worked out. But if he's abusing u, then it's best to get out. Anything can be worked out with effort from all involved, but some things are harder than others to solve.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the ppl involved.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	There is no rational ... rationality to deciding to divorce a lot of the time. My husband says he didn't want to divorce me but he started cheating and made it impossible for our blended family to stay together, blaming it all on me. I would never call divorce the "best" of anything. Sometimes it becomes an option that is badly "needed."|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	It won't make problems disappear, but sometimes is the best solution. Sometimes relationships and the people in them change or are not good to start with.<br>  <br>  If love dies, or there is abuse..divorce is the only real solution. Staying together in those situations is pointless.|`|HAk6iROaaa	Divorce is an option. But the solution is to not get married. Now there's some practical common sense!|`|28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	Divorce will never make your problems disappear, it makes heaps of misery, stress and plenty of ill feeling.I caught my ex wife with another man when I returned home from working away, what was I supposed to do, once the trust has gone there is nothing else. I lost everything, she took the lot and she had the affair. It took 6 years for me to be able to talk to her properly again and I am still paying loans for the legal fees from the divorce as I wanted to keep my children with me.So that's why I divorced, my ex cheated on me big time, it's also when I found out that UK divorce laws suck.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	Divorce is not always the answer. Everyone has problems in their marriage at one time or the other.  Before making such drastic steps it is always good to try to work things out because after all you loved each other once and  a person should be totally sure that it is over before walking out that door forever.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	If you don't know how to love and are not willing to learn, divorce is the answer.<br>  <br>  Love is something that doesn't just happen but must be practiced. it is why scriptures say not to be unequally yoked. Can you imagine how frustrating it is when only one person is making the sacrifices and the other is just taking everything that is given without making any sacrifices for the same common goal? It happens too many times. Courts have been filled with such couples.<br>  <br>  My oldest son was angry with me for 2 years over something he thought he heard me say over the phone about him. He heard a portion of the conversation and assumed the rest. He said I was startled to find that he was still in the house so my reaction solidified what he believed I said. He couldn't give me the entire conversation but it wasn't until I grilled him did he realized that his attitude about me was ludicrous. In those 2 years, he just would not talk to me. The communication was gone. I made up in my mind it was not going to happen and something had to change.<br>  <br>  This is what some marriages need. Misunderstanding and one or both parties believing things that just aren't real. What if there is something as simple as being inhibited. All that takes is a conversation but the fear won't allow it.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I think most issues that people divorce over these days can be solved with counceling, however they aren't willing to admit their mistakes or put the effort it requires to make the marriage work.<br>  However, I believe there are some things that marriages or spouses cannot get over, even with counceling - abuse, adultery, etc.|`|8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	It is like a partnership firm: both have to adjust and run the business( LIFE) There are so many hurdles and different of opinion: Tolerance, mutual trust, forgo Ego, & etc are the must for a peaceful life: Everything should be discussed with open heatedly by the partners: then what is the problem ? where is divorce?|`|V9VJIw1Uaa	it is not easy to tell you here. if any of your dear ones is going through this process then be with that person then you will really understand. no one wants divorce dear. but there is no other option left. it is very painful process. no one wants that much pain in life. but they cant help it. <br>  wish you never to have this trouble in your life.|`|EyKmEptVaa	Consider counseling ,it depends on what is making you consider though if there is abuse and/or cheating and if you can't talk to work out your problems,then i guess divorce maybe an option.But both of you have to decide if your marriage is worth fighting for.Divorce is the easy way out.|`|zY7boFYNaa	It all depends on your situation, if you just want to let go of everything and you do not see that person like that anymore, as a husband, you should leave him, completely, cause then you'll be someone whom you are not feeling well around with all the time.|`|09k5GLLkaa	Depends on what the problem is and how severe. And it also depends on if the problem is fixable and if you even want to fix it. No way to answer you without knowing more.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I think divorce comes after you have explored all your options with none of them working and you are sick and tired of being sick and tired.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	No, the problems will still exist in a way, just not as you think.  And if there are kids, why put them through that as well?|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well I was very physically and mentally abused in my first marriage and that is why I chose divorce|`|xQGCf8GGaa	no<br>  there is always solution for each problem<br>  if u find then ur problem is over<br>  it need some time and understanding too<br>  talk abt it and get rid of the problem|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	because it failed and pretty there's nothing left but problems, heartache etc stuff like that?|`|GdPCE9wbaa	it depends on your problem type.|`|Y6pHjVP9aa	It may be the easiest.<br>  i'm not sure about the best.|`|Mf5i0Hcraa	For me it certainly wasn't . I'm deeply in dept ,I've lost my relationship with my kids, I've lost my home and my savings, I live by myself and don't have much of a purpose in my life anymore. If I could go back-and do it all over again I would give in to my personal wishes and just do everything possible to live life with in the situation making small changes over a longer period of time. In other words  Getting divorced has been like biting my nose off to spite my face ! I would have done better to just go out at night , maybe stay at a bar ,friends  separate vacations, Just stay away from the bullshit. I did everything for my family and when I got hurt and the Queen of the house had to go back to work she just hated it and me for making it happen to her perfect family !  If you think that it may end in divorce someday anyway may I suggest that you start hiding cash some where that the spouse is never going to find it !|`|skvzwS8Faa	I don't believe divorce is the best option especially when there is a kid involved. That's a huge problem in America today, no one understands the word commitment when they get married. Marriage isn't meant to be simple, it takes work. But don't the best things in life take hard work? I would say the only time divorce should be an option is if there is abuse or something of that nature going on in the marriage.|`|kiCccef4aa	Why divorce ?  Yeah ....Why Divorce...<br>  The basic purpose of divorce for a couple<br>  is to re-collect their Individual freedom.<br>  <br>  The marriage is already over, once divorce is<br>  comtemplated.<br>  <br>  So, I will suggest the Husband and Wife to...<br>  to become Neighbours first, and try to enjoy<br>  their Solitude.<br>  <br>  They may develop a deeper sense of missing <br>  each other.|`|lkOHnSU9aa	Dear Friend,<br>  Please remove the word Divorce from your head first. Its not the answer. As it is a path of no return. When we get married we promise to love one another till death do us apart with God as witness to it.<br>  Now if we break this bond , we break a commitment and an oath given.<br>  So i fell give each other and talk to one another. It will surely solve your problem.<br>  All the best give it a try and tell me > ok :-)|`|af2bb29a607e269fd8497ceea873f78faa	divorce will make your marriage disappear, an not only the problems. So, if you care for the marriage, divorce can't be an option to solve the problems.|`|OuJilG4Zaa	i do not think so! marriage is like a garden it need good care.<br>  to share a life,it need a tremendous work.<br>  nothing is easy in life and it will never be.
cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	I would just hand her the note in front of him (after you've made a copy of it)! Ask her what it means and give him the most angry look you can. If he tears it up, then wait and when Mom is alone give her the copy!|`|bjsOnyPkaa	Sorry about your situation however you need to let mom know. Let her know that you love her and feel it's in her best interest if she see's this note.|`|gSdSRceRaa	You have a loyalty to your mother. Give her the note and explain to her that you truly dont want to interfere, but that you love her and dont want her to get hurt. She will appreciate your concern.|`|8wDXm4Kiaa	Give the mother the note and let the adults figure it out.  She will do the best thing with it I assure you.  Be prepared though if she stays with him for an ugly relationship between you and him though...Seems as if he doesn't respect your mother.....<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Leave the note somewhere where you are sure only your mom will see it. In that way, she can never blame you for the demise of her marriage.|`|EyKmEptVaa	Give her the note.Let her read it for herself i guess.Tough situation to be in for sure.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	At your age the best thing you can do is stay out of things as much as possible.  Since you found this note then that is hard to do at this point.<br>  Before you give her the note tell her that you found this note that another woman was writing to him and were afraid it would upset her but you felt she should really know about it.. She should ask you at that point to see the note and this is when you give it to her so she will not be totally surprised and shocked when she reads it.<br>  You really want to make it as easy on her as possible.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	Oh man, you should definitely tell her you have something extremely serious to tell her, and give her the note. <br>  Obviously being as gentle as possible. <br>  I hope your mom, and the rest of your family can recover from this as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you too.|`|JbKPj42Uaa	just come out and say it, if u dont tell her now its only gonna get worse just say mom i have somethig rly rly important to say to u and tell her wat happend and abe show her the note if u can get ur hands on it|`|UdatjYEQaa	ouu..<br>  tell herr!<br>  you have to..<br>  she's just going to be hurt in the end anyways;<br>  you don't want your mom to continue this bad relationship|`|09k5GLLkaa	Give the note to your mom and let her deal with it.

Please just throw it away. Oh well, go ahead give to your mom.|`|qX0Is1lyaa	Everyone agrees your mom needs to know but as to how that is the real question. I suggest that if your mom has a sister that she is close to then give it to them and tell them where you got it from. When she gets this it's going to hurt and having a friend there than might help soften the blow. Not that this is going to be a picnic but still. Anyway if there is no one then spend some special time with her doing something that just the two of you like and after sometime has past start by telling her how much you lone her and how great the time you spend together is. tell her you found something in your dad stuff when you were looking for whatever and found this then give it to her. give her some time to process it,but hang close and let her know if she wants to talk or company your there.|`|8TDnfCkaaa	It's a hard decision to make at your age. I would suggest you tell your stepdad what you saw and let him make the decision to tell her, or have you tell her. good luck|`|B53KDVuJaa	Give the note to your mom. She won't have to say anything about where she actually got it from, and can handle the rest.
5a328dcc94efb65565b23591fae9787caa	I agree with Nascar,<br>  <br>  People are in our lives for a reason and a season.  I look at people in my life like a novel, when people come and go in a story.  Some characters are in the book from beginning to end, others come in the beginning, the middle or in the end.  Its like people in our lives. You meet someone early in your adult life and they are around for many many years, and suddenly they are gone. You might have thought they would be there for eternity, but that's not always the case.  <br>  <br>  It could be that their part in your story is over.  It doesn't mean that they did not love you or the relationship was a waste of time, its just that it was time to end, and they are no longer needed in your life. Its time to prepare for a new chapter.<br>  <br>  The relationships that last a lifetime (literally) were destined to be that way.<br>  <br>  I thought my 1st love would be there forever.  I never thought I could feel that way again, but when our story ended, a whole new chapter opened up for me. Each new partner you experience love on different levels, because there are no two people alike. Each will bring something different to your story.<br>  <br>  There can be multiple partners in your lifetime and your depth of love can be experienced with each one, however, in the end, there is only one.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I think theres more than one person for you......but maybe only one of THAT PERSON.

e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Do it face to face or not at all. <br>  Hiding behind electronic gadgets means she does not mean enough to you to waste your personal time with her.<br>  <br>  You see her on the weekends, then ask her on the weekend.|`|nXxtBkguaa	is it safe to assume you guys aren't in a relationship?<br>  <br>  That wording's perfect, face to face or over the phone.  Not on facebook.  If you guys are already dating then sure.<br>  <br>  Doing it over facebook makes it seem more friendly.  More like you don't really like her in the date type of way, but if you have to chose someone to invite to prom then you'd choose her.  And if that's how you feel then by all means.  But in person says more that you really care, and that it isn't just kind of a random last second thing.|`|5lu0TPUkaa	It seems a little sheepish. Almost every girl you would ask how they want to be asked to the prom they're last idea is facebook/myspace.<br>  <br>  Talk to her face to face starting with something like "Hey, so found a date to the prom yet?" She should then say no and you can smile at her and reply "Would you like to go with me?".|`|62e9ba78ee48eedceb41743f5846f0a9aa	Well, if I liked you id still say yes. But I think if I were her id want you to ask in person. <br>   Don't be shyyy just ask her.  Get her flowers leave a note on her locker telling her to wait for you & that you want to talk to her & when you go there & shes there, ask her to prom & give her the flowers.|`|IKnEeMXLaa	I think it would be better to ask her in person, putting a note in her locker and giving her flowers after asking her is a really cute way!|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, it's better if you tell her face-to-face, then just doing it over the internet nor phone.|`|8hsD9qvVaa	You know, to answer your question, thats fine :)<br>  <br>  But you know what girls reaaallly like and respect more? What will raise the chances of her saying yes by 3 million percent?<br>  <br>  Ask her in person witha big but shy smile. It shows her that she is a big deal to you and you genuinely care.|`|tGovHV0Kaa	I think it would be cuter if you did the same thing, but in person...<br>  i bet she'll like that you were courageous enough to do it, i know i would<br>  =]
WizSb46Uaa	Oh, so sorry about your loss.  He must have been an amazing person to honor all his family members in the ring.  <br>  <br>  I would keep the ring and wear it a a right hand ring.  He had it made specifically for you and the ring has history.  He wanted you to have it, and since grandma wants you to keep it, you should.<br>  <br>  Wear it on your right hand to remember him and his family.  Tell his mom you will wear it as a tribute to him.|`|bcZSIphUaa	You poor sweetheart.<br>  <br>  Keep it definitely.<br>  <br>  Wear it if you feel like it...if not keep it somewhere safe so that you can treasure it forever.|`|1hciyvKdaa	If the grandmother gave her blessing its yours to do with what you want, if you want to sell it though, it should be returned to the family minus the diamond he bought for you. Someone will enjoy it, even if htey just put it away for some other use. Its nice that you are concerned about the family this has been so tough on all of you, it must be comforting for them to know, you were truly the woman of his dreams. Im sorry for your loss.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	One of my dear friends from church lost her fiance.  She wears the ring on a gold chain around her neck.  <br>  <br>  For now, you can keep it on your finger if you'd like, at least until you're ready to think about dating again.  You need time to recover before you can move on.  When you do you may want to move it to a necklace.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	you can wear it, of course!<br>  he gave it to you because he loves you and that hasnt changed. you should hold onto it, even if it just sits in your jewelery box. its a symbol of your love, one that you can always hold on to.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Of course you can wear it. Wear it on your right hand or on a necklace. And she is right. If they feel you should keep it and don't want to take it back from you then definitely keep it.

Since you have tried to give the ring back to the family but they want you to have it I would make it into a necklace, diamond earrings or perhaps a cocktail ring.   When my fiancee and I broke up, I kept the ring and had earrings made from it.  And it took me many years to do that as I was in love with the ring.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	Keep it. It was given to you in love. Im so sorry for your loss. I know how you feel. I lost someone I loved very much when I was 26. Im 35+ now. Just hold onto that lovely memory, and when your ready to move on. You will put the ring in your jewelry box, and look at it with fondness. That's what I did with the ring my old love gave me.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	If the family has asked you to keep the ring, I think that's all the answer you need.  If its too difficult for you to wear at the moment, I would put it somewhere safe, and maybe your feelings over the ring might change as more time has passed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im very sorry for your loss.|`|JtJxVBOsaa	You can wear it for as long as you like. I think his grandmother and the rest of his family would like you to keep it. When you're ready, you can move it to your right hand. There's no reason you should ever stop wearing it if you don't want to.|`|aipChC3haa	I think that you can and should wear it in his memory.<br>  It is very sweet of you to ask this, and it's obvious you loved him.<br>  I'm very sorry for your loss and I will keep you in my prayers.<br>  Just remember that he is in a better place now =)|`|TTjDATeOaa	I would still wear it until I was ready to date again. And then keep it as a symbol of his love and our past. That is so sad, I'm sorry this has happened to you!|`|AA11002962	my fiancé passed 2 mon before our wedding, My mom told me when a Husband or fiancé dies its triditonal for the woman to wear her engagement ring on her right hand for at least a yr. i wear mine still and its been a yr and a half in the end the decision is yours but i still wear mine to this day to remind me that hes with me in sprirt|`|1VDukD7iaa	First, my heartfelt sympathy to you for your loss.   My suggestion would be to do what your heart tells you to do.   If you feel like wearing it one day, then do so if it gives you comfort.  If there is a period of time when it's too painful, then put it away until you're ready.   Since the grandmother does not want it, and that's understandable, have  you discussed this with his Mom?   If she wants you to have it, then there is  your answer.   Perhaps you may want to have the diamonds reset one day into a ring, earrings, necklace, etc.   If the family diamonds have a sentimental value to the family, maybe his mother would want to do the same.   But for now, do what you're most comfortable with day by day, hour by hour.   And my best to you in the future.|`|4cSHX4QPaa	I would definitely keep it. He must have put a lot of thought into it for you. Which means he cared for you. I wouldn't make it into a necklace.. he designed it into a ring on purpose, if you create a necklace you are losing the meaning that he put into it. Wear it on your left hand until you are ready to start dating again, when you are ready.. simply wear it on your right hand, this still keeps the memory of him alive. If his Grandmother tells you to keep it, then she cares for you as well.. If you don't wear it, at least keep it in a jewelry box where you can look at it and cherish it forever.

iqShn0UIaa	An amazing girlfriend is one who will make me feel...well... like nothing else in the world matters. Someone I can just be with and feel in tune. She has to be comfortable with herself, she has to be confident and she has to be genuine. She has to allow me to see her at her worst and at her best, and she will want to see me at my worst and my best. Shes the girl that when your friends push away from you, shes the first person to pull you in. She is both the safety net and the trapeze artist. She is there to catch you (and you for her) while shes also there to make you take risks and help you grow individually. She has to give me my space but hold my hand at the same time.|`|m0QaQZhLaa	shes gotta look nice, not be annoying, be able to have an intelligent conversation, not slather herslef with makeup, not be fake in any way, and be interesting. or at least have something in common.|`|FrOQ9pL0aa	a girl thats just there self and has not alot of makeup and an outgoing but fun personlity and u sund like a fun and a girl i would love|`|EkgZeAbqaa	for makeup wear eyeliner but not lispstick|`|ixHwF4apaa	if it is amazing girlfriend then<br>  1.personality will be automatic<br>  2.some spl traits will be there<br>  3.atleast some makeup will be there<br>  if she approach me, i will try to have a good friendship with her.<br>  shall i tell my different idea<br>  instead of the gf i love, i prefer, the girl who loves me,<br>  personality, special traits, makeup, will not count|`|FFuJ08vhaa	someone who can talk<br>  someone who can listen<br>  someone who cares<br>  someone with the same kind of kinky thoughts or fetishes<br>  someone who does not lie<br>  someone who looks great dressed up or down<br>  someone who does not need makeup to look and feel beautiful<br>  someone who is happy with what they have, how they look and is not looking for a doctor to change something<br>  Someone who understands that you dont need to be called everyday to know we still care about you|`|70At0HClaa	to be independant, both have seperate interests and to come together  to have fun and laughs whilst both having a strong trust and attraction to each other, and that from my best friend who is a guy on the nearest to perfect match everthing else comes natually.|`|2kR4sX48aa	makeup no i keep it simple so for a girl maybe light makeup<br>  personality open but not too wild, more reserved is what i like.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	there are too many things to list <br>  <br>  its usually what you expect from us with some differences|`|282f3c3ef67f759a8388216dc595a9dbaa	much less than you would expect

wRHhpanmaa	It depends...lol<br>  <br>  I had a unique wedding... Darth Vader walked me down the aisle to the Imperial March, (star wars fan club, a guy let my dad wear his costume, it was funny because my dad sounded like darth vader and everything. it wasnt like a cheap halloween costume, it was a genuine thing that costed close to $3000 when the guy bought it.)  (and when it came time to kiss the bride, he sprayed breath spray in my mouth, and when he heard my mom crying, he took a hanky out of his costume somewhere, and gave it to them, then told the priest, proceed. )The groomsmen were Storm troopers, R2D2 was the ringbearer (remote contolled) I had a big plain white dress (the theme was black and white) so i tied a black ribbon under my breasts, and compensated by wearing black combat boots underneath. My hair was black with white streaks and I had black fish net arm warmers. The preist said may be the force be with you , I now pronounce you man and wife. lol. My roses were black and white, and I had a Jack Skellington Cake and black and white cupcakes with Star wars characters, and Nighmare before Christmas figurines on them that people could take home in little white and black boxes. At the reception we also had like, modern songs, and my dad is a really really good dancer so he was still dressed up like Darth Vader, wearing a white t-shirt saying father of the bride (he had bought it especially for the reception) and we were playing the low by FLo Rida and my dad was popping his butt with his hand on his knees and everything, and it had everyone Laughing...... he also did a little "pole dance" for us... it was so funny to see darth vader acting like a goof, even if it was my dad.<br>  <br>  It was cheap and it is something my husband and I will remember forever and ever. <br>  <br>  He is a star wars nerd, and I love the nightmare before Christmas, so we kinda put both into our wedding. we watched the nightmare before christmas at the reception, and our first dance was to the star wars theme song.<br>  <br>  My mom was a wedding planner, so if you need help, you can email me individually, and I would be glad to help you. <br>  <br>  what type of things do you and your fiance like? i wanted my wedding to be a day i never forgot...and it wasnt.

In their quest for a unique wedding, it all ends up the same.<br>  <br>  For a truly unique wedding, personalize it and imbue your personalities and interestes unique to you and your fiance into your wedding.  What makes a wedding isn't necessarily how unique it is or how different it is from others...it's how personalized and reflective of the couple's personalities that make a wedding unique.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi Sara and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!<br>  <br>  I agree with the second poster.  I am not trying to be mean...but believe me, everything has been tried, done, etc.  If it is truly "unique" then it would not come from any of us...it would be something that you would need to think of on your own.<br>  <br>  Each wedding is unique as there are no two people alike.  The best way to make yours unique is to personalize things and bring in your likes, tastes, etc. to everything.  <br>  <br>  Yes, eventually, every wedding does "seem" the same, but in reality, they are not as no two people are the same.  <br>  <br>  Also, what is done in one part of the country may not even be heard of in another part of the country, so you will need to think of something that has not been done where you live.  With that said, though....remember that your guests are there to celebrate with you.  Really, I hardly ever notice things such as:  what the "colors" are; if favors are handed out, etc., etc.  What I like the best is when the bride and groom take time to visit with their guests.  That, to me, means the most.

AA11879371	One of the things my family learned from my brothers in boot camp (and other military personnel) was that "cheating" is not condoned.  It damages morale and just kicks the life out of a soldier.  As a military man he knew that.  <br>  <br>  It all depends on how you phrased "I'm young and not ready to get married yet."  You dated for three years.  He knew you took the relationship seriously.  I am assuming you kept writing to him and/or calling him.  If this is not the case, he could have felt abandoned.  But if you still kept the lines of communication open, then he is the one to bear the burden of blame.<br>  <br>  In my opinion he had a weak moment and used your statement to give himself permission to have an affair (or 'cheat').  When you have other mis-communications of that nature will he do it again to console himself?  And then blame you?<br>  <br>  Giving him another chance is your choice.  It is human nature to make mistakes,  But I think you need a couple of rounds of counseling to set boundaries and clear the air for a more committed relationship.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, hun.  It's your life, live it the way you choose.  Just remember you make the choice, not us.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i dont think you should forgive him<br>  my boyfriend is also in the navy, he is also doing this carreer chose for us and our soon family, and we are young<br>  but even if were utterly pissed at eachother and no matter the distance nither of us would put up with cheating.<br>  if you love someone, truely madly deeply love them you would not cheat on them. <br>  the distance is hell, but it is not a excuss for cheating.<br>  im sorry if i sound mean thats just what i think.<br>  email me if you wanna talk anymore.

There are girls who would be happy to be with you.  But I think you are afraid of opening up to a girl - not because you can't stand to feel the pain of unrequited love, but that you are a commitment-phobic, because you are afraid to risk being hurt.  And while it is true that your experiences are not the norm - and you have been hurt and scarred - if you have truly learned and grown from your experiences, they can make you much more caring.  But all of your wisdom and ability to feel won't do you any good if you are afraid to risk loving. <br>  <br>  Have you gotten any help for your substance abuse issues, and for the abuse?  I know that NA or AA can help you come to terms with your substance abuse issues, and the tools that they give you can help you put your whole past into better perspective by working the program.  We both know that being healthy is more than just not using anymore.  When you get to the right place, with help, you will be able to open up, and the right girl will be there.  Trust me.|`|4FCRCCKqaa	you will don't worry, girls that you want will come around.

You also have to have more confidence in yourself and not let your fears interfere with your desire for closeness. You're also still young and you're at a University, so I'd say your chances are pretty good.

Go for someone like you who understands your problems, someone who will stick by you no matter what happens. Be tremendously cautious of your choices, please. With all that pain make sure your ready for someone to love. Don't go for the sheep.|`|HAYlmwdtaa	try building your self esteem and i think you'll be okay....you should start by turning on the light in that dark little world you live in.  also it's okay to be different, just don't be an idiot|`|l5ZlateWaa	hey huni id be very interested in dating a guy like you ur diffrent to all ova guys ive dated and i think ur sweet email me if you want xx|`|AXJdRGWcaa	go try and get a girl<br>  not be on the computer|`|BRMKkAXqaa	oh defintely ull find luv and there will be a grl who will luv u for who u r.dont worry abt it.an imsorry 2 hear abt ur past.have faith.|`|COs7vGWSaa	You'll get a girl someday. Its hard now a days because alot of gurls are superficial,and materialistic. But there are still real gurls sosome werethere like a dying breed. Just try not to let your past experience and pain that your dad caused you to make the man you are 2day. Dont hold that weight on your shoulders cause if you do then thats when you will be alone. If i was single id date you just to get a chance to be with someone. Oh and drop your fake friends, theres no point of having them in your life. Its better to have no friends then fake ones that will double cross you and stab you in the back. Good luc|`|g6p6PXfvaa	You may not ever find a girlfriend if you just walk away when you find someone attractive!  If you're afraid of rejection, you need to try to deal with that, or you very well may never get a girlfriend!  Girls like to know that you're interested in them!  Your past may be attractive to a lot of girls, you know some of us like the bad boy!  But the fact that you're at university now speaks to your ability to persevere and succeed, which is another attractive quality.  But your "heart of darkness" will only be attractive to a certain group of girls.  But you need to go and put yourself out there when you find a girl you like!  Did you ever think that the reason your love goes unrequited is because you don't ever pursue it?  Doesn't it hurt to just leave a girl that you like behind?  The fact that your music takes a primary role in your life may also make a girl feel second best, which we don't like too well.  Also if they don't find your music as entertaining as you do, that may be hard to tell you.  Anyway, get your butt in gear and go after these girls!|`|ivV4pCcnaa	You're story was somewhat heartbreaking to me. It must be really hard to go what you're going through right now. Doubt is indeed very painful!<br>  <br>  First of all. You need to get comfortable with who you are. It sounds as if you don't really like who you are and you're not comfortable with that. Have you ever thought about joining a community group or activity outside of the university (thus giving you a way to come out of your shell or find yourself amongst other people)? Have you considered doing something where you're involved with a different age group? Sometimes, we find ourselves best when we're out of our usual atmosphere, away from our peers and exposed to a "new light" in society or something of such a nature. <br>  Consider doing something that will give you a chance to thoroughly explore who you are and who you really and truly want to be. I promise you, once you figure that out and establish some self respect, you'll worry less about what other people think (such as worrying about girlfriends and "fitting in") Once you're comfortable with who you are and start defining yourself by the choices you make (whether "they" care or not) you'll see the light. <br>  Then, will you have the confidence to know and not worry about liking a girl too much or getting a girlfriend, etc. There's hope! You can make it happen =)<br>  <br>  God Bless!<br>  <br>  -Sally|`|mW1EcKOPaa	Of course you'll havea girlfriend, if not wife! There are people in the world who are the type to look for people exactly like you, as they have either understanding personalities, or find your type mysterious or interesting. No one can exactly predict how long this will take for you to find someone, but I know we all have a plan in life, and whether you are looking for someone who matches up with you in their lifestyle, or looking for the opposite, you'll find them. I have no doubt in my mind.|`|rGJznUUxaa	Everybody has a soul mate. There's somebody out there for you. Don't be afraid of unrequited love. You'll never get anywhere in life that way. I'm sure you'll find the perfect woman sooner or later. Don't give up. 21 is young. <br>  <br>  Have you heard the song "Don't Blink"? Well, I'm not saying run around without blinking. But life your life to the fullest. Use match.com or eharmony. That's how my mom got together with my step-dad, it's their 21st anniversary in a months--that stuff works,

70xZdTJfaa	You are on the right track with wanting to learn how to improve in this area.<br>  <br>  You will find a lot of info on line that will teach you how to manipulate the other person. This is not what you want.<br>  <br>  Good relationships come down to treating the other person right and being mature yourself.<br>  <br>  One of the best books I have read is called "How to Win Friends and Influence People". You can see a summary below.<br>  <br>  Remember this quote: "You want to be the kind of person you would like to date."<br>  <br>  In other words if you don't like dating selfish people, then don't be selfish.|`|m3x0TsY6aa	answers.yahoo.com<br>  idk if u kno bout this one but i hope it helps|`|yMAfJngcaa	Ya don't ya wish there was. Don't read anything about relationships unless you really need it. Be yourself and take love on as something new and take relationships with your own perspective so its one of a kind. Sorry i didnt really answer your question.
0b5f07e5bab316afb60fcb47e579b84faa	I've had guys do this to me, too. I would assume it is flirting, but no one can be sure. When guys like you, they try to get your attention by doing something immature. Most of the time, they do this in packs because they're too insecure to do anything on their own. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would wait it out and see if he does anything else (if he messes with you again, then he is obviously picking you for a reason, not just some random chick). Or, if you're confident enough, you could go up to him and make a joke about it. Like, "Hey! Where's my dinner?" lol.|`|zVh8by4Raa	i think he likes you
2GvhQtyhaa	just kiss him and let yourself go..touch him && get naughty && let him touch you to...haha...then you can actually tell him you ready...just say like "babe im ready"  and he'll say "ready for what?" then say im ready to do it! haha (safe sex tho..use a friking condom!)|`|lbvE1bMqaa	well..once you know both of you are ready for "things" you gotta be willing to get diseases that will effect how you reproduce and all that. how old are you?|`|O7xYvttsaa	wen ur making out, take his pants off, and if he says stop, then he's not ready.<br>  <br>  xD|`|ijZmJXggaa	i think i speak for all guys when i say this, he's ready.<br>  <br>  i dont know a guy ive talked to since 6th grade who doesnt wanna do things with girls, and your best bet is to show him you want to do things.  most of the time, things end up not happening because we, as guys, dont feel as though you ladies want the same things we do.  show him what you want, and if he doesnt seem to be getting it, your absolute best bet and the single best turn on for a guy (or at least for me) is when a girl climbs on top of me when im sitting on the couch or something like that.  sit right on top of his crotch and wiggle your hips a couple times and look at him sexily.  he will go crazy haha|`|QFEbDUTAaa	break the touch barrier.. slightly suggest him that you want it.. dont make it obvious.. just when you are alone flirt alot with him, and keep going until you get it or if he doesnt want it he will stop you..|`|vHcoVeS4aa	ask him if he's ready.
uYVyEZ7Aaa	jump him<br>  <br>  <br>  lol|`|3jFD9PSFaa	Well maybe if your comfortable with it ask him, and i will not describe how you turn a guy on.|`|I9TvRy5Daa	Ask him.
7LRPvZkhaa	im not sure if he had a legit excuse but if i were you i would text him and just straight up ask him if it was because of you, or if he really had to do something else and if he was planning on sneaking out with you another time|`|udmQP0w7aa	Try ONE more time in a few days.<br>  <br>  if then he doesn't show then you know he is just couldn't handle it.|`|zVh8by4Raa	just drop it|`|jNDvvolYaa	Today, my email discussion group and I batted around the subject" Exes as friends....Fact or Fiction?". Most of my friends said exes can be friends and I had one that said it depends on the end. I say this because the important part is both ppl have to want it. Im sure you are an intelligent person and some one that would be great to know. The ball is now in his court. I"m not saying he doesn't want to, but now he needs to show you, You made yourself available to him, now let him be available to you. This is something that you MUST learn for future relationships to come. You're worth it!|`|rcut6bhoaa	Whats the big hurry.  Dont text him and ask him, wait for him to come to you.|`|ubC1reIraa	it was rejection girl..lol<br>  if he never talked to you after he ditched you..then it's rejection|`|JVYs2TCpaa	What are you guys sneaking around for. Are you 11 or does he have a girlfriend or something. For what ever the reason, you are not worth the risk. Move on.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	he's probably not ready to talk yet. and the sneaking out made him think of how you two used to be together and he couldn't handle the feeling of rejection all over again.|`|JnuOBwhIaa	move on or text him saying can we talk about it at another time|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Ask him why he couldn't go..

v8Xr0Mn9aa	heck no. don't do that. God forbid something bad happens. your parents wont forgive you. let alone the two of you could end up in a terrible situation. i know you're probably saying 'oh boy, her comes a sermon" but guess what A HARD HEAD MAKES A SOFT BEHIND, leave your little sister out of places like that. girls get raped ,murdered and end up missing all the time.i don't know how old you are but you could end up in jail.|`|Q3WweuOCaa	Why? She's 15. Your gonna smoke from a Hookah with your 15 year old sister and her friends? Thats kinda lame. Leave her at home to watch Hanna Montana. You sound like my 7 year old that can't do anything on her own without her 4 year old sister. Get your own life!|`|1jltjtjSaa	no ones going to accept your younger sister and friends without somethin in it for them<br>  <br>  ($$$$$$$$$$)|`|iqShn0UIaa	It's illegal for you to bring her to the bar, theres nothing you can do about it.

XH2o1MM6aa	.I'd say Sophie likes you.Next time you get the opportunity Don't have to rush away and get to know her better.Also drunks are usually sincere about their fellings.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Computer game,DVD,CD T-shirt,sports shirt.cap, sunnies
8NPXQerUaa	Give it a week...wait until this Thursday.  And keep it short, respectful, and caring.  I suspect that you want to pour your heart out to her eventually, but wait until she opens up to you before you do that.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Darezz,just send some flowers and wait.She'll respond positively
XH2o1MM6aa	.Don't interfere and let things develop of their own accord. You might upset her if you try to get too familiar.Everything comes to him who waits.
L2SLF4L5aa	If you really like this guy and you don't want to ruin your great friendship...just stay good friends.  If he is that interested in you...you will be the first to know.  He will pursue you...if that's what he really wants.  Simply flirting with you doesn't necessarily mean that he's into you....in that way.  Don't get yourself caught up into feelings that aren't really there.  You'll only end up hurting yourself.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.At this stage the girl code applies.So concentrate on just building this relationship up.He seems content with the present situation.So why don't YOU talk to him at school.
ijZmJXggaa	DUDE. texting???? why would she ever want to talk to you?? you think a text will help???<br>  <br>  because i read similar questions over and over and over again, im going to paste my last response to a similar question. some of it may not pertain to you specifically, but it will be helpful if you are looking to improve yourself for women in general..<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  <br>  evaluate every aspect of your life, from your weight, your height, your clothes, your build..(basically everything that girls look for in attractiveness), think about the way people view you (are you the joker, annoying kid, quiet kid, asshole, nice guy...) and if its something that is negative, change the way you view yourself and people around you will follow suit. you dont need to change from the nice guy to the asshole, but you do need to get away from nerd-like tendencies and being socially awkward. I am still a nerd, but i dont show it. i leave that aspect of myself at home, and im completely different out in public. Get some confidence, i cannot stress this one enough to all the people asking for advice on this website. you need to have enough confidence in ANY situation you may find yourself in with a girl (such as a random situation where you meet a girl and get her number, to the first date, to having sex). all of this comes with experience, but the way you experience them all is by having CONFIDENCE and asking girls out. Everything you do around a girl WILL be noticed, whether it be your body language, to what you are saying, and HOW you are saying it. dont be nervous, just be chill and confident.<br>  <br>  One problem you have, is the same i do. and after thinking about it, its easy to fix. all the girls you are attracted to are NOT single. you know why???? its because they are dating someone else, and thats why you are interested. you wouldnt be interested if they were single. but the fact that they can be viewed as someone "date-able", makes you want them. trust me, once you get over this, you'll be better off and finding more women.<br>  <br>  i'm currently single, like you. just try not to sweat it so much. you have to put yourself out there and find a comfort zone in everything you do around women. just because you havent dated anyone yet, doesnt mean there's something wrong with you. it just means that you havent developed fully into what a girl wants. you have time to change this, its early yet. compare yourself to the assholes in high school who got all the women. you know what they had that you didnt? thats what you need to get. you need to start lifting all the time (i dunno if you're fat, skinny, or whatever, but lifting is what you need to do. all the time). also, go to parties a lot if at all possible. you can watch what all the guys do at parties to hook up with girls, and you need to emulate that. <br>  <br>  as far as meeting women goes, take a long, hard look at all the girls in your classes at school, and think about every one of them individually. do NOT get hung up on the ones who have boyfriends, cuz messing up someone else's relationship is NOT ******* cool and its how you get your *** beat. if your classes situation is completely hopeless, take a hard look at where you work and if its possible that girls come in regularly (such as a restaurant or clothing store). try to meet women that way. if both of those fail, try to meet women through your friends. hell, if that doesnt work, you're gonna need to hone your skills on how to pick up women who are complete strangers. someone you would just walk up to, start a quick, easy conversation which gets them interested and attracted to who you are, and ask for their number before walking away RIGHT AFTER getting their number, so as to not lose their interest. you gotta be quick with pick-ups. if you cannot successfully pick up women, message me about how to do it better, or ask another question about it on here.|`|JMiIjqyGaa	She does NOT like you.  Move on my man.|`|g6p6PXfvaa	Well, first of all, don't ask her out on text!  Also, you should start by asking her what she is doing!  If a guy texted me and told me what he was doing (especially if it wasn't that interesting), I would probably be like "Oh." too!  It seems kind of awkward to me to just text someone and say, "Hi, I'm playing PS3 right now, them I'm going to baseball practice."  What do you expect from a text like that anyway?  The Oh, just means that you need to learn how texting girls works.  Ask about them first!  As for asking her out, do it in person, at school or wherever else you see her.  Just ask if you can talk to her for a minute and say that you would really like her to go to prom with you.|`|ywXrF7mQaa	Stop over thinking the little things. I say O in text's cause i'm too darn lazy. She might like you. It's hard to tell. That's exactly what i would do so i wouldn't seem lame. Just don't act like a pig around her that TOTALLY turns girls off. It dosen't seem possible ,but you might be able to catch her heart. If you ask her sweet talk her use charm. Be original don't use those stupid pick up lines. Compliment her on something good she did. Don't stop trying.|`|8t7E9S1taa	just come to her and ask her and if u want to make it hard for her to say no get her some roses r something <br>  <br>  goodluck :)|`|my53ST0Eaa	im ganna go with she doesnt like you =[ <br>  <br>  but you could give it a shot and ask her anyways|`|iqShn0UIaa	You like her because shes hot, not because of who she is. She sounds like shes hot and she knows it. Don't mess with girls like this, chances are you wont be able to ask her to prom. Really, you seem attracted to her for 1 reason, and its physical, not emotional. Cut your losses, the girls on the top will never date a guy at the bottom, and a guy who only cares about girls and talks about girls the way you do. Grow up.|`|YevNFgdkaa	Well id go with what everyone else if saying just go for it and ask her if she says no fair enough there'ss plenty more girls out there and liking someone for there ***s is a bit shallow and not a relationship that's going to work out very well but if you really belive it would work just go for it if you can't ask this girl out. are you ever going to ask anyone?|`|fwoDYUx0aa	She probably just responded like that because its weird for guys to text girls b4 they actually talk to them in person. It happens to me a lot with guys and its honestly a little creepy like..how did you get my #? So just try to talk to her in school and you never know, you might just hit it off=]|`|Bt87yaApaa	well there are a few options...<br>  you can::<br>  1. try to start a conversation with her<br>  2. just ask her!! the worst thing she can do is say no.<br>  3. try to let her get to know you.
DYsxVQ1jaa	he prob shouldnt kiss on a first date, when you have never seen him. if it were ME, id play hard to get and not kiss him yet.<br>  just be cassual, jeans,flats(or sparis) a sweater or something.<br>  :) good luck
DYsxVQ1jaa	your pretty.<br>  just some big girls,,,,,,,,|`|VfkyAUWuaa	Wtf?<br>  <br>  Ew....|`|hGWhzfFqaa	You're trashy and look like a man.|`|goG3d3Liaa	holy shyt u got some big titties|`|AA10230993	I'd tap that. Haha nice set of knockers.|`|CBa9G4j4aa	You're not attractive, sorry.|`|tWSYjZMWaa	wow, that is awesome.  i would totally tap that. wow, best thing ive seen tonite
DYsxVQ1jaa	he doesnt feel the connection so much now......
O7xYvttsaa	nothing. that girl should know that her friends come first. you should wait til her friend gets over you. or the girl should talk to her friend about it.
LETd2hQwaa	I'd let it go personally. If he really wanted to continue, he'd be pursuing you. Don't chase him. Let him chase you. Consider those dates great memories but don't stay there waiting for him to come sweep you off your feet. Move on and if he moves with you, great. But if he doesn't don't worry. The next guy will be even more impressive. Just be positive and don't give in to the chase.|`|RgymoiIQaa	I would not do the chasing. If a man is interested in someone there is nothing that will stand in between him and that person. I think if he was interested he would be texting and calling and trying to set up the next meet. That's just my opinion.  Like you said you initiated the second date. So, now I would say the balls in his court.|`|pXTUMTdEaa	maybe try arranging a date? send him a text maybe like "movie at 5 on saturday?" it gives him a time and place and its easy to do
5cm40qU8aa	yes do it wit a girl that isnt a virgin!! she has more experience and shell kno stuffs.....hehe........
ai2qq3J2aa	i think hes tryin 2 make u jealous nd maybe he wont u 2 go back also u should ignore him|`|3YJUdOZOaa	well if you haven't rung him why should he have to ring you? it's not like you were together. what he's saying is you havent spoken but its not all his fault you didnt make an effort either. hes probably being spiteful and showing you he's better off without you.|`|JJARLh3zaa	sounds like he's trying to make up in a really weird way. doesn't sound like a good boyfriend|`|EZHZW7QFaa	He's an idiot. He's mean to. Why would you call someone that you broke up with (and possibly hurt) to casually let them know that you are seeing someone else. That's cruel. Who cares what the hell he was doing for 2 months. My ex was like that. Such an asshole. He used to tell me that he "should be able to be free and date and that we should just be friends" but god forbid someone even complemented me he would want nothing to do with me. Your ex is selfish and he probably got a little bored with his new g/f and needed to see what you were up to for his own dam ego. You want to teach him a lesson?? DONT EVER SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN..trust me you'll thank for it.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I can't tell. Sounds like he's checking on you for some reason. Could he be lying about the girl he's seeing and trying to make you jealous? I really don't know. that is strange.|`|hFsl7WpPaa	sounds to me like he is not worth bothering with.
DYsxVQ1jaa	meanie!!<br>  :) you deserve better.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I don't think she is a friend. maybe whenever she is around-start staying that is stinks in here and start asking her about what type of deoderant she wears. start sniffing around her everytime you see her. should mess with her quite well.|`|VJhZe9VBaa	what the hell. are you serious? don't put up with it, you don't need it. you don't deserve it, stop hanging with her.|`|c674775dc13c0f95352cfe22a3a3450baa	Oh I have one of these. I cant sump her because I have known her for ten years. But the fact of the matter is.. you should. Let me tell you something that will make you feel better. This is the truth: SHE IS SO JEALOUS OF YOU. She feels like she needs to cut you down to make herself feel better about her pathetic existence... get rid of her.|`|4KIRr9SNaa	I don't feel like answering, so here's some stars ***********|`|7UfK1CPZaa	she's not a real friend, you need to ditch her ***, and find new friends|`|FL2nfCSXaa	if she's a friend, you should be able to be honest with her and tell her you didnt appreciate what she said.there are ways to go about putting her in her place without having to get angry and raise your voice.|`|rSIF5jtSaa	She might be joking. Try telling her that she's getting out of control and that she's hurting your feelings. If she's not joking then she's not your friend and you can take your kindness else where.|`|iFJZ9fFVaa	Tell her shes a *****.
N7gOE1btaa	He doesn't like you, thats why he is rude.  Maybe you did something to annoy him or he just simply is bothered by you for no real reason.  Sorry, but not everyone is going to like you in life.

84zKeJxnaa	It kinda depends on what your family would think.  If they are pretty strict and against you dating, then it would most likely be a bad thing to do.  If you have pretty easy going parents and you wouldn't think that they would care about it, it probably isn't that big of a deal.<br>  <br>  The type of person it is would also affect this.  If the person is influencing you to do bad things, then I could understand you not telling your parents/family about it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped some|`|zYEfkwmxaa	i think it is a bad thing

N7gOE1btaa	I didn't read the whole story, but judging from your age its likely that you don't really love your boyfriend.  I believe that you may feel it, but it isn't a strong enough feeling if you are seriously considering being with another boy.  At your age its good to date different people if you find people you like, that way you will learn the type of guy you really want.
GaLw1qMwaa	" money is the root of all evil "<br>  <br>  keep your head up high, your parents need to realize their love is stronger than a piece of paper. all hope is not lost. it could be much worse. for instance be thankful they havent already lost their jobs.<br>  start looking for another job, even look in nearby cities.<br>  <br>  think of a new job as a new beginning.  everything changes, we cant control that, we can only control how we react to it.|`|1MUJBiYRaa	One thing I found that really helps.

You might find that once you get to know him you don't like him as much anymore, cuz he's not who you thought he was, or, something could end up happening between the two of you. <br>  If you don't like that option, you should try hanging out with other guys and meeting new guys so you have someone to take your mind off him. I find that that works.. I've never done it on purpose, but a few years back i really liked a guy (despite the fact we hadn't talked properly for years) and the only thing that got me truly over him was when i met another nice guy, which took my mind off the first guy, and showed me there were other fish in the sea. This has also happened a few times since, so you could give it a go. <br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|lJXxxWH7aa	girl same situation, i just went cold turkey and i think u should too, im planing on altering my schedule in school so i dont see him often and trying not to think about him or think about him|`|YxOWoBZYaa	its a crush soon u will get over it when u find someone better i guess .. if u know ur friend is in love with him keep away its not worth fighting over a male|`|FrOQ9pL0aa	u need a new bf|`|Yc7rHVD8aa	get away from him, you attention & he knows it but hes ingoring you, hes deff screwing with you, just leave, it will hurt but its for the best ive been there trust me|`|wI5bhnuBaa	Well, you need to keep recycling in your head that you shouldn't worry about things you can't control.<br>  I would just start with becoming acquaintances and try to hang out with him or whatever when you and he can, and work up to being casual friends, than you can talk openly with him.<br>  G'luck!

RvFuQIsgaa	haha aww this is such a cute question. I found that kissing with braces on doesn't make a difference. It doesn't matter if both of you have them on or just one of you does either. The only time i could imagine someone maybe saying that they notice a difference is if one person was pushing their lips a little bit hard on the other person. In that case you don't even have to pull away or anything just gently ease yourself back a little bit and problem solved. I had braces a few years ago and kissed someone don't even worry about it they don't make a difference at all. I hope I could help you out =]|`|nSXlffmpaa	No not at all braces don't have any effect while your kissing. The only time making out with braces that feels a bit awkward is that the person has elastics. You can take them out out ^_^. I have a girlfriend, her and I have braces and I recently got my taken out and I don't notice anything different. The only thing that is bad while making out with somebody while having braces is that you produce twice as much as saliva which can be very gross at times. Hope that helps you!|`|pXTUMTdEaa	just make sure even if things get heated that you don't press too hard.  his lips and gums wont be used to the brackets or you could wind up tearing up the flesh inside of your own mouth :S|`|4drQ38qZaa	Don't worry a bit sweetie. My boyfriend got his braces off and I'm still have braces and we have kissed and it doesn't affect us at all. Well actually he did say when we kiss it feels a little wet so your saliva could increase a bit but that should be about it. However I would stick to closed mouth kisses just in case. You don't want his tongue to bleed. Good luck!|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	omg classic lol<br>  <br>  I have braces and I've kissed with and without with people who did and didn't have them<br>  <br>  makes no difference whatsoever lol
nGhqwEdpaa	Well, my son is 14 and acts JUST like you. I can't say or do ANYTHING to make him happy. The ONLY time he is nice to me is when he wants me to buy him something. Its just a faze kids go through..though I NEVER treated my mom like that. Of course back then, they could beat the hell out of you. I respected my mom. Go to your school councilor, ask to talk. I think your mom needs to go to family counseling with you, she shouldn't be hitting you like she does. Get some advice from school and maybe you and your mom can start with some small talk to get back on track. I know you love your mom, but maybe she doesn't feel it from you. Moms feelings get hurt too..we even cry when we can't help our kids and feel like we have failed and aren't loved. Talk to her, calmly. Good luck to you..|`|R6TFrDtxaa	go talk to a counselor right now. You are acting like a normal teen but no one should ever HIT you. Tell a teacher or someone. Next time it happens call the police.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	Oh dear, it certainly does sound like you're having a time of it.<br>  <br>  The angst you are experiencing is a normal part of growing up.  Adolescents and their parents have been having the same problems since the beginning of time.  Look at it as nature's way of making it easier for you to leave the nest, and for your parents to see you go.  While you do need to learn to control yourself, what you are going through does not make you bad or abnormal.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the situation at home may have gotten out of hand with things very physical going on.  Perhaps you should consider speaking to the guidance counsellor at school, they may be able to help.  If you are not comfortable with that, is there a teacher you trust to talk to about this?  You need to speak to somebody.
hfyvLLNEaa	DON'T ask your friend to talk to him. Just a bit of advise. Try to think, If I wasn't attracted to him, how would I talk to him. Look at it this way, if a kid in your class started talking to you casually, would it be a big deal? Nope. Just talk to him casually. If he plays guitar, ask him if he's going to battle of the Bands on Saturday. If he likes basketball, ask him if he's going to the home game on friday. Or just simply ask him something about the particular class you are in. (Like the homework, etc.) Or, if you are friends w/ one of his friends be like, yeah so your friends with so-and-so right? ... Yeah he's really cool, we hang out a lot ... etc., etc. Remember, CONFIDENCE IS KEY|`|DT1Blo2paa	that is so cute but like CASUALLY drop your pencil and CASUALLY kick it behind you dont like chuck it behind you lol and ask him to give it to you, or ask him for a pencil or a pen before class but keep one in your binder or something just in case he says no and turn around again and say thanks anyway i found mine then ask him if he did the homework or if he even got it and if he didnt and you did ask him if he wants you to help him or if you didnt get it ask him if he can help you!!!! hope this helps good luck!!!|`|YrJgZXcGaa	Just say hi with an smile and start talking to him. Be positive and bold. There is nothing wrong if you talk to someone. Its all about the way you start talking to someone. Be confident that you can talk to any one.

You need to use your femimine touch. spice up your looks.<br>  <br>  second thing is to silence. you can do more with silence that talking. dont be dumb but use your words carefully when you talk to him.<br>  <br>  remember it is his job to go after you as long as possible other wise if he gets you easy he will leave you easy.<br>  <br>  last thing and the most important thing is two.3 things that attracts a  man to a woman is her:<br>  <br>  Eyes: it is your biggest tool. the way u look at a guy sends question marks through his mind.<br>  <br>  Body:the way you divert you body is key. it holds the key to let him drop his guard and let him be putty in his hands. i am not saying to throw your body side to side. what you do you keep your legs together because what it tells him that u are not easy to open up. when u sit keep your left above your right leg. it works like a bomb.<br>  <br>  intellegence: no guy likes a dum woman. not attractive at all. beauty and intellengence works hand in hand. work your looks and your brain.<br>  <br>  what i am trying to say is that the more guys want you the best chance that he will follow the chasing pack for you.<br>  <br>  i would not prefer for you to talk to him btu rather find out more about him. work this tips for this week and tell me what so far has happened. then we will take it from there.|`|OK8GpIeXaa	well to make a boy notice u should first of all talk to him about like something u have in common about if u don't have anything in common about then ask your friend's BF to talk to him. trust meh all u need is confidence and u got this in the bag!|`|1hVKeOEmaa	Guys don't really think its creepy if you talk to them, just be like "hey" wusup wuz craking and **** like that.and be like can I borrow w/e it is that you need to borrow and and then over a certain period of time just talk to him about other topics|`|1VCxckdUaa	2 way, if you are a active type, just come and said "hi", everybody know u active already, so it nothing weird.<br>  If you are a shy type, give him a smile when ever you she him or your eyes meet.<br>  good luck|`|jjoBO3jkaa	Ask to borrow something, or just strike up a conversation.

Talk to him about something that's going on in your school or what's on the news. <br>  RELAX! The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed THEY are and the more creative you are.

It is nothing he is trying to do against you, so I wouldn't hold it against it him personally.  The economy is real tough right now.  It's the toughest it has ever been in your entire lifetime.  Jobs are extremely hard to find right now and especially in Las Vegas, that is true.  Las Vegas has hit a little rough patch here.  My advice is that as long as he is trying his best and he has ideas and goals, then I would be a positive force for him and encourage him to do what he wants to do.  Just be patient and positive as he tries to find a job in this current economic situation.  Best of luck!

It would really hurt if you replaced ME. <br>  <br>  If he won't listen, then give him some space for a while. Let him cool off and come back to you then you can talk. Ask some of his friends why he might be feeling this way too if he won't talk to you; see if he's told them anything. If he refuses to listen, write him a letter telling him what he means to you and mail it to him. Then wait. After that, it's in his court to come to you so give him some space and see if he does.<br>  <br>  You are going to have to go on living your life, and if he does replace you then you are going to have to move on. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.

d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	There are several choices for coastline cities on the West side of FL.<br>  and I will guess that they all offer some type of wedding package.<br>  <br>  For what you want, I would suggest going with a hotel and package. Considering all the costs involved, you will come out better this way.<br>  <br>  Specifically, without knowing any details, I can recommend<br>  Sheraton 4 Points in the Destin/Ft.Walton area. Their prices were decent, you can have your ceremony on the beach and they will provide chairs, decorations, and they have a small, separate "cottage" with a deck for a reception where your guests would just walk back up to from the beach, as well as other indoor meeting rooms<br>  <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=817" rel="nofollow">http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints...</a>|`|sE8pH2aNaa	ok actually im having my actual wedding with friends and family in march or april too!! i live in florida and i found this place in long boat key (which is in florida not one of the keys by key west :) that was absolutly gorgeous!!!  its called the wicker inn i went to a wedding there when i was little and always wanted my wedding there. now that i am engaged and the fact that my fiancee is now in the army and the fact that i have older family members who can't walk too well we are ending up having to do it at this place called paradise cove its also known as the buena vista watersports complex...its by disney and it looks exactly like a beach its gorgeous too! but the wicker inn is something you should look into the website has pictures. literraly the place has a pathway that goes right to the beach the only thing is the reception would have to be outside there isnt an inside place but its amazing and we are on a  budget too and it wasnt bad at all.. literally you can rent out this cottage looking house and if your guests want they can rent the rooms surrounding...look into it its gorgeous! <br>  good luck hope this helped!|`|1cdb5875cce621bbd5487293bcd78059aa	There is Sanibel Island and Anna Maria Island.  There are many more, you just need to google.  Also, the Bahamas are only a short flight or ferry ride away.
CNlfn5Wraa	I got engaged the end of October and I always dreamed of being a June bride with an off the shoulder dress and then as I was decorating the Christmas tree it hit me that a Christmas wedding would be beautiful. Yes, you are taking a chance with the weather but any date you choose there is a chance for problems. We did it the weekend after Thanksgiving and I was able to have a fall shower theme. Instead of a wishing well I had a Christmas tree and asked each guest to bring an inexpensive ornament. Our tree each year is full of memories. As for the wedding the girls wore red and green velvet with stoles and carried poinsettia's with muffs. I had white poinsettia's and roses. It snowed a week before the wedding and I have beautiful picture in the snow. The day of the wedding it was 55. All worked out and it was beautiful. The hall was decorated for Christmas and Santa even dropped by. Congratulations and have a blast. There are no limits as to what you can do.|`|7TcxJqW4aa	You can decide on the date based on the easiness to remember your anniversary. Such as my friend got married on 08-08-08... there is 09-10-11. and so forth...<br>  <br>  Also, you can choose it based on the Season your wedding will fall on. If you want a summer wedding, a winter wedding, a spring wedding... <br>  <br>  Also you can choose to get married on a already special day, like Valentines Day, the day you met, and so forth. <br>  <br>  Or you can just think about how long it will take you to get everything together, especially the money, and choose to give yourself at least a year to plan it. <br>  <br>  Lastly, you can choose the place you want to have the wedding at, and see when they are available and decide from there. At lot of popular places to get married are really packed at certain times of the year, so you might choose to call them and find out when they are open. And then choose your date. Also, call the church if your marrying by church and see when they are available. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9UpKxA1yaa	I picked July 18th because I wanted it in July and the 17th is our anniversary and I wanted a date that was close to it. (I wasn't obsessed with it, but I thought it would be nice :) ) We are having the wedding at 11:30 because it will be July in Ohio and I am hoping it won't be too humid since it will be outside.|`|1ctmytcqaa	-My husband picked the month and I picked the date <br>  -We got married on a cruise ship so we could sail away for our honeymoon. The wedding coordinators set the time, which was at 1:00P, and the reception followed before the ship sailed. It turned out to be beautiful (better than I expected), and the food was delicious.|`|FMjsTCWTaa	I asked him when he wanted to do it and he said April or October because it's not too hot or too cold outside.  April was too soon so we went with October which gave us about 11 months to plan.  Picking the day in October was easy too.  I picked the day before his week's vacation starts so that we'll have the week to take a honeymoon.  So 10/4/09 it is!|`|7JDA7m7Laa	i picked a date that was in between our birthdays (mine aug, his sept.), that would be easy to remember & just rolls off your tounge. Your time should depend on the season. Since ours is in the summer our time is in the evening & the reception is at night.|`|4p9ez6PHaa	my man and i picked Jan 30th 2010 cuz its 3 days after the anniversary of the date he asked me out Jan 27th 2009. just keeping it special ans simple for him to remember ;)|`|PPuQHViaaa	June 11, 2011<br>  <br>  That was the date of my graduation party where my FH told me that he had feelings for me in high school.<br>  <br>  So I guess you can say it was our "first date"|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I wanted August, he wanted October, We picked in the middle, and decided on labor day weekend :)|`|0jUGSaZPaa	My anniversary with my fiancee is June 10th... So, we picked the closest to that, which is June 12th, 2010 that falls on a Saturday.  For time, we are thinking about 4 in the afternoon... We're having our reception and ceremony all at one place... So, we wanted to keep the times close together...  Ceremony will be 15-30 min.  And Then cocktail will start at 5 or 6.  Then reception at 7.  :)<br>  <br>  You have to take a few things into consideration...  Such as, if you have it at 2 separate locations, you have to think of the drive for each guest.  And, you should allow yourself enough time for your photos...  At least an hour...  So you are not rushed.|`|7CKipTZOaa	We are wishing now we would have set it sooner hehe but we picked August 12 to give people plenty of notice, have a summer wedding but not when temperatures are overly high and hot where we are from and another key factor was that is when the garden is gorgeous (We are having it outdoors). As for time we have yet to finalize, we want to make sure the sun doesn't interfere with videos and pictures but still have natural light|`|hkwBR1moaa	We're getting married on 04/11/09.  We picked April 11th because it is our 7 year anniversary.  <br>  We were supposed to get married October 15, 2005 but Hurricane Katrina came and we had to postpone it.  So when we were deciding on this date, we refused to do it during Hurricane Season and since our Anniversary fell on a Saturday, we lucked out.|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	Actually he picked the date that way he would not forget our anniversary (it keeps him from being in the dog house). Our wedding date was 08-28-07. the date is one month after his 42nd birthday.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	We picked our favorite time of the year - fall - and picked a day we felt was a nice solid number - 25.  It was pretty easy to do.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Because 80% of our guests would have to travel we knew we needed to keep the wedding to a Saturday and we also wanted to ensure we served them dinner so that was our own requirement.<br>  <br>  From there we included or excluded months: <br>  Excluded winter (mid-November to mid-March) because we didn't want weather to possibly hinder travel for our guests.<br>  We excluded late April, May, June, August & September because my fiance races and we also attend some races during the year and we didn't want a conflict.<br>  We excluded July because my fiance didn't want a summertime wedding (he doesn't like the heat).<br>  We were then left with late March, early April, October or early November.<br>  I started looking at the calendar and found that Halloween fell on a Saturday in 2009 and its my absolute favorite holiday.  My fiance was fine with the idea so we picked it!|`|kQA7SbY9aa	My husband proposed one New Years Eve. He wanted March. I thought it was a bit too soon and wanted June. We went to a few catering halls and March 12 at 6:00pm was suggested at one of them. It was off-season and prices would be cheaper than if we waited until June, so he got his wish. For a wedding pulled together on such short notice, it was the best. I was worried it would be cold but we had an unexpectedly beautiful day...mid 50's and sunny...unusually warm for that time of year.|`|4UUVrWXtaa	The first that came to my mind when i started planning my wedding was the wedding night.. hahaha.. so i started calculating when my period would be (which is very stable, even though i know is never a sure thing).. (my fiance totally understood that).<br>  <br>  -Then we decided on August 29 since he will have the week before and the week after off work (for paid vacation).. but to our surprise our church doesn't do wedding on August (yes, we were very upset)..<br>  <br>  -So, we decided on Sept 12, since is the only day the church will be available at 2pm.. all the other options are at 11am and is wayyy too early for us!!<br>  <br>  What about you?|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	8/1/09 is our 3-year anniversary and also our wedding date. It is also a Saturday, which is convenient. We were both happy with that because we would have no new dates to remember and it's a Saturday so it's good for everyone else! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HxbspmBpaa	The Date depends on the time of year you want to get married!<br>  Spring Summer Fall or winter. Hopefully you want nice weather!  Time is most usually in the Morning because you say your vows, then go to the wedding reception if you have one. Then its off to the honeymoon!<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10784932	We wanted to get married in October, but his cousin had announced that they were planning an October wedding, so we moved it up to September 5th. We wanted a fall wedding, and it will be inside, so if it rains it won't be a problem.|`|q8eue7CRaa	We wanted to get married in the fall, so the date we picked was when our preferred venue was available during that time of year.|`|sGP6s7uraa	May 9th just stuck and 5:30pm so the clock hands would be rising UP on our wedding and not DOWN on our wedding (if that makes sense).
