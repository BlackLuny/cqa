You need like 8 phones though|`|iPSM76Xyaa	Phones without a telescopic antenna use a flat antenna with a fractal design (sort of like the branches of a tree, or ice crystals).  The fractal, it seems, makes it much easier to pick up multiple frequencies (like those used by the cell network, WiFi and Bluetooth).  Without such an antenna, the phone would require multiple antennas.|`|sg1wfaTAaa	even if you shut off service on a cell phone you can still make outgoing emergency calls to 911     that's why i don't donate/recycle my phones right away- i keep a spare phone wrapped in its car charger in my glovebox    also some phones that have wifi access- if you need to call 911 and there's no signal in the area it will look for a wifi signal and make an internet call instead    the little symbol on people's phone that that looks like a sniper crosshair hashmark thing is actually a gps icon and whenever that pops up it means that your call/location is being tracked by gps satellites for police/emergency purposes|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	You can tell the people with too much money.

wM9oHibwaa	Alright...      First, you have to start your wii. In the wii menu, you have to click on the icon in the bottom  left, the 'options' icon which says 'wii' on it. You will now get a screen with 2 squares in it. Click on the square on the right-hand side. It says 'wii settings' on it and has a picture of a wrench. You will now come to a screen with 4 buttons on it. Click the arrow on the right-hand side, to scroll to page 2. Once on this page, the third button from the top is 'Internet'. Click on that. Next, you will come to a page with three icons on it. Click on the first one, the 'connection settings' button. The next screen also has 3 buttons, with each one saying 'connection (1,2, or 3)' and 'none'. Click on the one on the top, and you will come to a page with two buttons. You probably have a wireless connection, so click that icon. Now, you can click 'search for an access point' and then choose your connection. If that doesn't work, then click the button in the bottom right corner, 'manuel'. Make sure 'wireless connection' is boxed, then enter the ssid [the ssid is the name of the network. ex: 'default'.] by clicking the box and clicking the letters. To find this and other information, go into your computer, (windows) and click 'start'. Now go into 'connect to' and click show all connections. Now look in the window and click on your connection. In the next window, click 'support' and then 'properties'. This will open a window with your codes. Now, click the arrow on the right of your wii screen (after you enter it) and click your type of security and enter the code. Now, go to the next screen by clicking the arrow and then click 'auto obtain'. If, when you test, this doesn't work, click 'no' and enter your codes. If you don't have them, try repeating other codes. Do the same for the next page. On the next,  do not use a proxy. On the next page, leave the MTU value as 0. Now save. Test the settings, and you will soon get internet!!!|`|r1MImdh3aa	If you have a wireless network, it's a setting in the internet settings, otherwise buy a nintendo wireless dongle and configure it.

KLL0Acrwaa	No, there are no more new Pentax K1000 cameras being made.    About the only new film, manual focus SLR being made is the Nikon FM10, which is also hard to find.    Pentax is now focusing on digital SLRs; their least expensive SLR is the Pentax K2000.  Bundled with a lens, it's about $560.    For comparison, about 25 years ago, I was selling Pentax K1000 cameras for around $300.|`|68396c0454eb463ff7cc72c3325192f3aa	Hi Tam,    There is no updated version of the K1000, and probably never will be.    It would help to understand why you want a K1000:    Is it because it has a reputation for being a good camera to learn on? If so, you can easily find a used one in good condition on eBay or KEH. KEH is a very reliable place to buy used equipment:    http://photography.shop.ebay.com/items/F...    http://www.keh.com/OnLineStore/ProductLi...    Is it because it's all mechanical except for the meter, so it will work even without batteries, and even in extreme cold conditions where batteries don't work? If so, again I'd look at a used one.    Is it because it was known as a good inexpensive starter camera? If so, any of today's entry-level DSLRs generally make better starter cameras. Pentax has the K2000, which is nothing like the K1000 (except for compatibility with Pentax lenses, flashes, etc.) despite the similar name:    http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/58...    Or you could go with a used DSLR to keep the cost down. Any Pentax DSLR is a great place to start:    http://www.keh.com/OnLineStore/ProductLi...    I see that KEH doesn't have many used Pentax DSLRs at the moment. Usually they have a lot more.     To keep the cost to a minimum, a used Pentax *ist DL (pronounced as if the asterisk were not there) is probably the least expensive good starter DSLR model:    http://photography.shop.ebay.com/items/_...      Good luck and have fun!    Greg|`|d24lC0BZaa	Pentax stopped making the K1000 in 1997. They've been out of the 35mm film camera business for several years now.    Something like the vivitar V3800N  or Cosina C1s might be a good fit, especially if you have Pentax lenses you want to use.    On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with a well cared for used camera - and there are plenty of them out there just wishing for a good home.

i7xO0RUnaa	It alL depends on what your actually trying to do with the dreambox buddy,    If your trying to connect it up to watch programmes then yes you will need to connect it to a satellite dish, but only if you have for example a dreambox 500-s,  If you have for example a dreambox 500-c then you dont need a satellite dish and only a cable connection coming into the house.    But the 500-s are extremely difficult if you don't understand,    But hey everyones got to start somewhere aint they matey. So why not play about with the box and see what you can do ok.    Now if your trying to use your dreambox for something to do with the internet then you will need a router and a crossover cable to connect it from your box to your router.    Hope this helps mate.
5z8uDqmIaa	I got a brand new lg vu and I only had to charge it for about 1 hour and that made it fully charged|`|sg1wfaTAaa	Yes you actually have to do it for the time they recommend. The initial charge on a phone is very crucial because it helps determine the maximum charging capacity of the phone right from the start. So if they say charge for 24hrs leave it plugged, uninterrupted and charging for 24hrs. before initial use. afterwards follow the directions for regular charging.    think of recharging your cell phone as breathing air into your lungs. the longer and deeper you hold your breath (or "recharge) then the more of your lungs you use so that you can hold your breath longer (hold a charge longer) in the long run.    but if you constantly take short quick breaths you never use your lungs (aka your battery) to its full capacity so you can't hold your breath (aka charge) as long as either.    i hope that makes sense to you and not just me because i'm on some pineapple express $*( &  right now  hahhahaa|`|ZDcWEZAEaa	howdy hannahh.!i would charge it 4 at least half the day!i mean come on u cant wait 24hrs without playing with it! wat phone is it. love yoohh.

3CJAUyqPaa	I agree with NYC fan.    Since we don't know what the conditions were when you captured the video, we don't know what might have cause the problems.    Does the video look OK when played back in the camcorder? "sound is horrible and video looks bad" are very general statements and do not give use anything to work with. Some detail of what "sound is horrible and video looks bad" would be really useful for us to try and diagnose the issues.    So... we can only guess.    If the camcorder is broken, then we know the reasons for the poor audio and video. However, "sound is horrible" is typically because very loud audio was recorded and the automatic mic gain circuit could not keep up. This results in clipped audio with a very muddy sound. There is no editor or computer utility that can fix this. "video looks bad" is typically the result of two items - one is that the lighting is to low (like NYC fan said). This will result in very grainy video. The other common cause is that the camera is recording video when hand-held. Humans were not built to remain steady - anything over about 8 seconds is a long time. There is no electronic or optical stabilization in a camcorder that can fix this and there is no editor or computer utility that can fix this.    Presuming the camera is actually OK, you have some options to resolve the problems, but the video in the camcorder is what it is... In the future:    1) For audio: In the case of the HC52, there is not much you can do - there is no audio gain control. This is common in entry-level camcorders. The only thing I can come up with is to use a "field recorder" like those from M-Audio, Zoom, Edirol, Sony, Marantz and others... then when you edit the video, import the audio from the field recorder, sync, and mute the audio from the camcorder.    2) For video: The HC52 is an entry level camcorder and has small lenses and imaging chips. These have the most impact on the light behavior captured to the recording media. You need to turn on the lights... or use a video light... or get a camcorder with bigger lenses and imaging chips.     If lighting is not the issue, use a tripod, monopod or some other steadying device like a chair, table or SpiderBrace shoulder-mount like system.|`|jLTDqVHsaa	It has nothing to do with the software.  I'd advise taking another look at your camera.    Specifically, why does it look and sound horrible?    Perhaps you're shooting in low light and the camera is compensating for it by turning up the gain.  Perhaps you're getting bad audio, whether wind noise, or you have set a manual audio level too high or low (I don't know if your camera has manual audio adjustment, so I can't confirm that).    What I do know is that your editing software has nothing to do with it, it's all about the camera here.

Hold down the A button as you pitch for a screwball, B for a curve, and A+B for a splitter.    Before the pitch, you can press the directional pad to aim your pitch.  Also, pressing the 2 button will make the pitcher throw sidearm, while the 1 button will return it to overhand.    EDIT: I stand by my correct answer despite the thumbs-down troll.|`|57Ykj95Eaa	You can throw different types of pitches by pushing A (Screwball), B (Curveball), and A+B (splitter) while throwing.    If you are playing another person try throwing lots of splitters. They can be hard to hit.     Mix up your pitch types and location when playing the computer. If you keep throwing the same pitch over and over, the computer is going to hit it

As long as you don't need to gig, or band practice, or play guitar more than 10 feet away from your pc....ide reccomend....    www.GAK.co.uk as a website to look at!    and yes, your guitar amp sounds f*cked.     good luck!|`|Jn09dNMvaa	I have the toneport and i hated it. its cool at first but it sounds so processed. its also a pain for recording because you can only play through their software. although it is a good alternative to cheesy practice amps.    for what you want you're going to need a pedal or a serious amp.
OosO8xxcaa	Hey- You can use any phone that T-Mobile offers as a prepaid phone. Only thing is, you will be buying it at a more expensive cost. I recommend purchasing a phone through ebay or craigslist. They offer used phones for much less. IF you decide to purchase through them, check if the phone works, if it has water damage, and that it is not badly beaten. These are just some of the things to look out for, but try the phone out before if you can.    On regards of the aim. If you get a regular prepaid, they will charge you .10 cents to send and .05 cents to recieve. As far as what I know, Sidekick's are the only prepaid through T-Mobile that offers unlimited texts, e-mail, web browsing and instant messaging. Hope this helps!

qWicVoU9aa	For an individual line the $69.99 (That is $39.99 for the voice plan and $30 for the Iphone Data Plan) iPhone plan includes 450 daytime minutes, 5000 Night & weekend minutes, unlimited data (email/web), rollover minutes and unlimited mobile 2 mobile.  Included features are nationwide long distance and roaming, visual voicemail, call forwarding, call waiting, 3-way calling, and caller ID.  The iPhone does not do picture messaging at all.

This is the cheapest plan for a single line so with taxes and all you would be looking at around $100 per month.<br>  <br>  Yes you most certainly can add a line to your Mom's on a Family Plan and then it would be $9.99 for the secondary line; $30 for the iPhone data plan; and $20 for the unlimited text messaging.

Holder Jr. today announced the arrest of more than 750 individuals on narcotics-related charges and the seizure of more than 23 tons of narcotics as part of a 21-month multi-agency law enforcement investigation known as “Operation Xcellerator.” <br>  <br>  Today, 52 individuals in California, Minnesota and Maryland were arrested as part of Operation Xcellerator, which targeted the Sinaloa Cartel, a major Mexican drug trafficking organization, through coordination between federal, state and local law enforcement, as well as cooperation with authorities in Mexico and Canada.<br>  <br>  The Sinaloa Cartel is responsible for bringing multi-ton quantities of narcotics, including cocaine and marijuana, from Mexico into the United States through an enterprise of distribution cells in the United States and Canada. The Sinaloa Cartel is also believed to be responsible for laundering millions of dollars in criminal proceeds from illegal drug trafficking activities. Individuals indicted in the cases are charged with a variety of crimes, including: engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise by violating various felony provisions of the Controlled Substances Act; conspiracy to import controlled substances; money laundering; and possession of an unregistered firearm.<br>  <br>  “We successfully concluded the largest and hardest hitting operation to ever target the very violent and dangerously powerful Sinaloa drug cartel,” said DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. “From Washington to Maine, we have disrupted this cartel’s domestic operations—arresting U.S. cell heads and stripping them of more than $59 million in cash—and seriously impacted their Canadian drug operations as well. DEA will continue to work with our domestic and international partners to shut down the operations of the Sinaloa cartel and stop the ruthless violence the traffickers inflict on innocent citizens in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.” <br>  <br>  “International drug trafficking organizations pose a sustained, serious threat to the safety and security of our communities,” said Attorney General Holder. “As the world grows smaller and international criminals step up their efforts to operate inside our borders, the Department of Justice will confront them head on to keep our communities safe.” <br>  <br>  To date, Operation Xcellerator has led to the arrest of 755 individuals and the seizure of approximately $59.1 million in U.S. currency, more than 12,000 kilograms of cocaine, more than 16,000 pounds of marijuana, more than 1,200 pounds of methamphetamine, more than 8 kilograms of heroin, approximately 1.3 million pills of Ecstasy, more than $6.5 million in other assets, 149 vehicles, 3 aircraft, 3 maritime vessels and 169 weapons.<br>  <br>  The 21-month investigation began shortly after the culmination of Operation Imperial Emperor, an investigation which resulted in the indictment of Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)-designated Consolidated Priority Organizational Target (CPOT) Victor Emilio Cazarez-Salazar, believed to be a command and control leader within the Sinaloa Cartel. CPOT Victor Cazarez-Salazar remains a fugitive. <br>  <br>  As a result of today’s arrests, federal charges were unsealed against numerous individuals in California, Minnesota and Maryland. Cases resulting from Operation Xcellerator are being handled by prosecutors in 11 judicial districts, including the: Central District of California; Southern District of California, District of Minnesota; District of Maryland; Southern District of New York; District of Arizona; District of Massachusetts; Middle District of Pennsylvania; Northern District of Ohio; Western District of Texas; and Eastern District of California. Assistance for Operation Xcellerator was provided by the Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section and Office of International Affairs. Additionally, local prosecutions will occur in Los Angeles, Orange County, Calif., and Riverside, Calif.<br>  <br>  The investigative efforts in Operation Xcellerator were coordinated by the multi-agency Special Operations Division, comprised of agents and analysts from the DEA, FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Marshals Service, as well as attorneys from the Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section. More than 200 federal, state, local and foreign law enforcement agencies contributed investigative and prosecutorial resources to Operation Xcellerator through OCEDTF. <br>  <br>  An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt.

The problem is a webcam uses 5Volts, your cars system is 12Volt.<br>  <br>  OK, that's not difficult, but finding a screen that works on 12Volt and will accept a USB input is.<br>  <br>  Its easier with a CCTV camera and a small 12V ( which is standard) monitor. Just connect them together (output of camera to input of monitor) and draw their power from the reversing lights circuit, then as you select reverse, the camera and monitor will come on automatically. Note, in the UK, this is the only legal way to wire them its illegal to have an active monitor in your line of sight whilst driving. And before you say what about Sat Nav's?

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  Just saw this camera in Best Buy and they may match the prices you see below if you print a copy to show them.<br>  <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy.

The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.

It has Image Stabilization, 8 MP, manual control of aperture and shutter speed if you choose, and costs less than $150.   <br>  <br>  You will need to buy some rechargeable AA batteries and a charger.

Now that kit is more like 1100-1150 or so at B&H etc. Let's look thru the lenses included, the 18-55 is the same as the kit lens for my D50 I got 2 1/2 years ago, the 70-300G is a decent lens, about 150 new, the 50 is about 130 new, the "2X telephoto" is a joke as is the "wide angle", these are tack on lenses and really a silly thing to an SLR owner to have. A lot of the accessories list are included with the D90 body, so giving them value is not realistic, the battery, charger, cables, software. So, you've got a body that's about 850 and around 400 worth of lenses and some other stuff, tripods, cards, bags, etc. I'm not going to diss the package, but I'm not going to jump up and scream "Great Deal!" either. The seller does at least have a good reputation and a lot of background on ebay, so you probably aren't going to get ripped off, and the Nikon brand parts of the package are all good quality.|`|e2o6hnLRaa	EE dude is right.<br>  Ebay always have these deals.<br>  If you don't want a VR (vibration reduction) lens, then it might be a good deal.<br>  To me VR lens is very important especially if you zoom in alot or take action shots.<br>  The lens great all around.  If you need to take longer zoom shots, then get a separate lens like the pros.<br>  Buy the kit for $1124 at butterflyphoto.com.<br>  Ordered and got it the next day even thou I choose the cheapest ground shipping because it's from NJ to NY.<br>  Check the prices at live.com and click cashback on top to get cashback.<br>  Some retailer give 6% and others like butterflyphoto.com only give 2%, but it's better than nothing.<br>  When I got mine, only butterflyphoto.com have it in stock.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend buying such expensive product from ebay.<br>  You have to read it very carefully because most of them are refurbished.<br>  They were returned to Nikon, repaired, and repackaged with 90 days warranty.<br>  If something is return, it's more likely that it will need repair later.<br>  <br>  Live.com's cashback is my place to check prices and get the best deal.<br>  Get a Transcend 16gb SDHC memory card for under $30.<br>  Transcend is the best value and works with all my cameras.<br>  <br>  Another thing is to charge your purchase to an American Express Blue Cash.<br>  You will get an additional year warranty for FREE and some cash back depending on your annual purchases.<br>  <br>  I have experience with it and they paid me twice.<br>  Keep the receipts and warranty card.  AE needs those information.<br>  They might as you to get an estimate for the repair.<br>  Once you submit your estimate from the repair shop, AE will credit your account the amount of the repair cost or they will refund you the purchase price.<br>  I got a refund on my DVD recorder 3 years ago and last year I got $500 to repair my Dell computer.<br>  I sold the broken computer on ebay for $400 and got myself a new Dell computer that's even better for $530.<br>  Ebay is good to sell stuff and buy cheap stuff only.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|oRnPNJRFaa	If u trust the seller to be genuine, its a hell of a great DEAL! i still dont belive it though. I mean forget the other stuff.  those 3 lenses for that price alone is amazing!!<br>  Id say if its genuine go for it!<br>  Good Luck

DNTbV4S1aa	Your connector is dirty. Wet a paper towel  with rubbing alcohol and wipe the plug clean. Then, wet it again and insert it into your walkman up and down a couple of times to "wipe" off the contacts on the inside.   Then  clean your plug again to clean off any crud you may have picked up from inside the Walkman.  Make sure the Walkman is off while you do this.    If you don't have any alcohol, try a pencil eraser. Just rub the whole plug end all over the eraser then wipe clean with a cloth. The abrasives in the eraser will clean the plug.|`|InQTnd4haa	there is some problem with the cable (wire). try getting a new one. if u have a spare ear phone. check out using that. if it's working fine then surely problem is in your earphone.  better buy a new one

AA11056614	I'm not sure how having the receiver in one room and the sub in a second is useful ... but I assume you do. The cable is called what it is, a subwoofer cable, but assuming you are talking about the RCA to RCA LFE cable it is simply a coaxial cable with a single RCA male plugs at each end. You can make one from a length of Coax video cable and two F connector to RCA male adapters.|`|5Wie7d3caa	Abt Electronics has a lot of subwoofer cables.    http://www.abt.com/search/search.php?key...|`|AA12041546	Ya, it's called a uhh.... subwoofer cable.
AA11056614	Yes, but not alone. Since the AVR 1907 needs to "see" IR signals to respond to commands you will need to add an "IR extender". The receiver unit stays in the room with the remote, while the receiver unit must be placed so that the IR pulses it emits (triggered by the RF signal from the transmitter unit) are visible to the AVR 1907. The one IR extender (if positioned correctly) will also pass signals to any other components with the AVR (e.g. DVD player, HDTV).    There are numerous models of IR extender (Google under that name), or have a look at smarthome.com.    On your last point, I'm not sure what you mean by knowing what mode it's in. There will be no visible feedback from the components in the other room. You will know the commands were sent, but will have to go and look/listen to be sure they worked.     Hope that helps.
c079209d6b6dda410f82cb305a7daa27aa	Sometimes Long-Distance phone calls do give the "Echo" effect...    It is the "ghost signal" which has reached the correspondent by a different length of path...    We just have to "put up" with the effect, unfortunately

Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.

785440e73a90380b1cea867ceab71780aa	Yo, Lp you know I am!!   I am definitely getting both Versus and XIII !!!  I almost peed watching the trailer w/ gameplay.   Wtf, all these FF haterz...    And Waffle:  It's not only about reviews, reviews, reviews(and sales, lol wut). It's if you are a fan of FF, or a fan of JRPGs in general. But I would invite everyone to buy and enjoy and FF game~~ I mean really...this games to me are greater than KZ2, or Resistance, or LBP, or Uncharted or Oblivion or whatever.   --------------  It's not just for fun, it's to be swooped into the story.|`|3kgqmJ6Laa	No......because i'm straight|`|oTWnXvFxaa	Of coarse I am, but we have to wait till mid 2010 which sucks but oh well.      And to the first guy who responded, PS3 is getting FF13 and versus, 360 is getting FF13, and not versus.  Just to clear that up.|`|VwUbvo4Paa	No, I mean yea the game will sell millions but I never played a FF game I will just wait for reviews. As for graphics it looks cool but nothing compared to the graphical games Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4.    The new trailer was cool. I wanna know though. Like when you play do you like actually move the characters with the analog stick and press like [] to attack and X to jump?? Or is the game like a strategy game where you pick your moves and abilities, if it's like this then I'm not really into it.    Though now since it's multiplatform some people that were gonna buy PS3s are now keeping their 360s. So I think that sucks. At least we get Versus. But FFXIII could of  raised PS3 sales by millions. At least God of War 3 could do that now.    EDIT: I just hope the game is good. But who really knows. I hope they don't hold anything on the power of the PS3. USE 70% POWER!!!|`|lGg8AU1Yaa	yeah, im pumped but i guess i have to wate till 2010. it comes out in 200 days for Japan.    Im also stoked that we get both XIII and Versus unlike the 360 only getting versus.|`|VcNHahtgaa	Of course. In my opinion, with it being multi platform, will become the best selling game in 1 week.    Final Fantasy is also exclusive for Japan, which will help PS3 sales a lot, seeing as Japanese love their final fantasy.    There are currently 2.8million PS3's sold in Japan, and for final fantasy games, they usually sell about 2million copies in the first week, and around 3 million lifetime. Saying that I'll say it again, it will help PS3 sales a lot.      On topic, I am pumped for this game lol :P. I was excited last night knowing that a new trailer would come out today. It wasn't what I expected though, thought there would be more like more places instead of the city. The Gameplay looks really fun too, I can't wait.|`|59Rd381caa	I guess especially because FFXII was awesome. And this game's gonna have the graphics look real life almost.    ...But I kinda don't like RPG's that much but I could give it a try.|`|pOi0wewIaa	No|`|PEGZmw73aa	Yeah, it's looking great.

MnTvROkmaa	this all depends on the game you play (ie COD5 uses other peoples connection on online play to "boost" others connection) but with a medium speed it shouldn't matter this much|`|cOQCC93maa	gus 1399, is right. If you have medium speed it probably won't affect anything at all, if it does it will probably be sometimes or rarely for that matter. I have medium speed and it works perfectly fine, but that MIGHT just be me, since I'm not too sure of what you have. If you have slow speed, it is sort of common sense to know that it will most likely lag, but don't get me wrong. Some people have no problem at all whether they have slow, medium, or fast. It all really depends.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, :D

A progress bar will appear on the computer screen indicating that the first stage of the restore process has started. When this stage is completed, iTunes will present one of two messages on screen with instructions specific to the iPod model you are restoring.     Restore Instruction 1: Disconnect iPod and connect it to iPod Power Adapter (typically applies to older iPod models).   Restore Instruction 2: Leave iPod connected to computer to complete restore (typically applies newer iPod models).   During the stage 2 of the restore process, the iPod will show an Apple logo as well as a progress bar at the bottom of the display. It is critical that the iPod remains connected to the computer or iPod Power adapter during this stage. Note: The progress bar may be difficult to see since the backlight on the iPod display may be off.   After stage 2 of the restore process is complete and the iPod is connected to the computer, the iTunes Setup Assistant window will appear asking you to name your iPod and choose your syncing preferences similar to when you connected your iPod for the first time.

fl9EozQSaa	All of them easily apart from GTA IV. That game requires such a good PC that Rockstar have said it is designed for PCs that will be relased in a few years!    It will run it, but possibly not on medium, however, if you turn the resolution down you should have no trouble!|`|skkOXxQEaa	it should|`|a81UK85baa	if yor screen is 17-19 inches i am sure for excellent run in tomb raider unwd but for assasin creed i am not sure of average quality , i think low quality might make it good,  the problem is with the game , it eats more power than it has been launched by company,ubisoft always cheats like that|`|YIW1KIi6aa	yes
DWBN7wDbaa	I have been using P2P programs for over 5 years now, and I highly suggest not using limewire. I can also say that WinMX is still by far the best one out of all of them. The original owners gave up on WinMX, and the community came together and got it back up. And now it has more features than before.<br>  <br>  Unlike Limewire, WinMX protects you from the RIAA/MPAA by blocking them from even getting on the network, it removes all fake files from your search results so you never get fake files, and it's fast and easy to use and NO SPYWARE!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.patchwinmx.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.patchwinmx.com</a>|`|htyH4MdWaa	no, they're not. you can get limewire for free, but just think, you're stealing from your favourite artists, there's no money going towards them if you get songs illegally. some internet providers are cutting down bandwidth for people who illegally download, just have that in mind when you actually decide.|`|AA11539218	limewire is free....the $35 is for the PRO version, which you don't need, just download the basic free version.|`|AA10695177	since wen is limewire 35 dollars and yes it kinda is

It was about $18.00. The  Gamestop aftermarket charger is better than sony's charger because the wire can be disconnected from the adapter and plugged into your usb slot for charging.

ag4WG3wQaa	One thing its not as easy as the guy above me said.  you'll need  1 Tower   2 power supply  3 motherboard  4 a CPU or  Processors with a fan  5 video card  6 Hard drive  7 Ram or memory  8 CD or DVD drives  9 Fan on back of the tower  10 Operating system  11 Keyboard and mouse  thats the basics    The sound card is already on your motherboard. if you want you can add a better one.    Listen i built my last 5 desktops i know what i'm saying. My first computer i built took me 3 days to build. Depending on the size of my hard drive i can have a computer built and on the INTERNET in 5hrs. I still don't agree with the guy above me there's things he left out.    Take your time and do it right and make sure you lay all your components out before you start. Any components that goes in your CPI slot make sure there firmly pressed in. Same with your Ram make sure its firmly pressed in. If not your computer want start up.    LOL i didn't have to watch no videos to build mine. I doubt you built yours in a few hrs. Its hard for you to admit i'm right.    LOL i bet you did you took from my answer you couldn't even get the basic right. Dream on in wonderland with your dell computer. By the way reason why it took so long i took my time being my first computer and i built it for gamming and i had to take my time to put my liquid cooling system in. But you wouldn't know about that.|`|ykXzzx65aa	U dont need anythign   all u need is a program called virtual box   this will allow u to install windows 7 on your pc and test it out|`|4vwtElmSaa	you will need;  a processor  a video card  a hard drive  depending on what u want it for u may want a sound card, but not essential  the obvious: mouse, keyboard and Monitor.    they're easy to build and you can get a lot of info on youtube.    forgot about the psu and ram but it is easy to build. I built one mylef in june without ever even opening a computer before.    ha ha 3 days to build a computer.... i had mine ready in a few hours. watch the videos on youtube before you start though    i have no problem in admitting i'm wrong, when i'm am. but i'm not. as i said i had never opend a pc before so of course i had to watch a video. by the sounds of it the asker has never built one before either so..... Why would it not have taken me a few hours? its simple once you mount the motherboard the rest of the parts just slot into it. my case was one of the clip ones where i didnt need any screws for the HD or the cd drives, did it take you 2 days to screw those in?    fair enough i didnt put a pump in, but other than that i built a gaming pc aswell, so it took you two days to install a pump? The reason i didn't take 3 days to build mine is because i wathced the videos and knew exactly what to do, tit
uC7IKCQ6aa	do the fans go full blast after about 5 seconds of power on and then shut off? if so.. then you might have killed your xbox..    or.. if you're lucky you just put way too much thermal paste on your gpu and cpu. just clean them and apply a really thin layer back on and if you're really lucky it'll work    also.. hopefully you're using washers and not just bolting the heatsynks on top of the gpu and cpu|`|vUGKu877aa	keep cleaning|`|caaa35814126b6a10afad243acd20fd4aa	Call Xbox Support.

AA10531094	I heard Vonage is great until there's a power outage. . . then you're out of luck!  Friends and a couple of relatives have Vonage and swear by it.  I'm concerned about not being able to use the phone in an emergency do to a power outage.  Weigh your pros and cons. Good Luck!|`|FSb7Okc9aa	Peaches' concern about a power outage is moot if you already have phone service through Comcast, since your Internet connection depends on the power working. Besides, the Vonage settings allow you to specify a back-up number (such as your cell phone) to call if your VoIP service is down for any reason.    I use Vonage for my home office and have been very happy with it, but the quality of service largely depends on how fast (or slow) your Internet connection is. At first I was using it with DSL and I couldn't download a file and talk on the phone at the same time due to bandwidth issues. I since upgraded to Verizon FIOS I-net service and the voice quality is top rate -- no voice degradation at all. Unlimited Premium Vonage service is about $32/month, including all taxes. Calls to U.S., Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Italy, France, Spain, UK, and Ireland are included in monthly fee; rates for the rest of the world are reasonable but extra.    Vonage voice quality is better than Skype, but if you're just making personal calls you might want to try Skype first. I use Skype to call my wife when I'm out of the country on business.

This will not cause damage to your xbox but will cause the system to overheat....after you hear the fans, unwrap the towels and let it stay on for 5 minutes or so to vent the hot air...turn it off, reconnect everything, and turn it back on....it should start up just fine. <br>  <br>  Remember this is only a temporary fix, and it might malfunction again in a few hours of playing.|`|oJJmJTuaaa	You can't bring it to Microsoft, you need to send it to them.

I found a free copy of "Tansee" iPod/iTouch/iPhone copy software and it worked great.<br>  <br>  Once the files are back on your computer, move them into the iTunes library folder and wa-la...<br>  <br>  Next topic: Burning files to a CD...that should be relatively easy...not only does Windows Media Player AND iTunes have built in software to interact w/ your already installed CD burner, but Windows (Explorer) does as well. All you need to do is locate which files on your C drive you want to burn, insert a blank disk and burn them to the CD (as a music CD - NOT a data CD) and then the CD will play in your car and/or any other CD player. Need more help, hit me up & Good luck!

It assumes you'll be using a private router, not one that's servicing a hotel or apartment complex that requires some form of authentication via a webpage.<br>  <br>  If you have a laptop, what you COULD do is get the laptop connected online, then connect the 360 to your laptop with a crossover ethernet cable (make sure it's a crossover cable!) and use the Windows program "Internet Connection Sharing" or ICS.  This will turn your laptop into a very simple router between your 360, and your apartment building's wifi network.<br>  <br>  The downside here is that the laptop must remain on and logged into the internet, otherwise your 360 will lose its internet connection.<br>  <br>  Setting up ICS is pretty easy.  You will need to create a network between your laptop and your 360.  This will require you to enter an IP address for both devices.  Just make sure the first 3 numbers are the same, and the last numbers should be different, but between 1 and 255.  For example, 10.10.10.1 and 10.10.10.2.  Networks starting with "10" are reserved for private use - like in a home or office - so they won't conflict with any address on the internet.

Play it about 5 times (to make sure its clean) Try playing GH.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work try the DVD Player cleaner. Again 5 more times<br>  <br>  Last Resort: Eye Fix = Send to Microsoft<br>  <br>  P.S. The 5x cleaning won't kill your 360's eye.|`|AA11400829	This is currently happening with my brother.<br>  <br>  In fact he got the "red ring of death" and had to pay $94 to send it to have it replaced. He got it back a couple of weeks ago, now it has problems reading the discs.<br>  <br>  He did research and found that all he can do is either send it back to Microsoft or buy the Arcade version of the 360. He said that version doesn't have those problems.<br>  <br>  So I would guess that the reader on it has gone bad.<br>  <br>  Sending it to Microsoft sucks because they just send back a refurbished one, which means it might be junk or it might work fine.|`|o6LrQTw6aa	It sounds like the try or the eye of the reader is going bad. I would highly suggest saving your money and prepare to not have it for a few weeks. It will more then likely dive very soon and it's $100 to fix.

Let me explain what you have... You have an AV OUT which lets you hook the DVD player to a larger television... you have a DC 12V IN which is a power port so you can plug it into a wall. DC meaning direct current, 12V meaning 12 Volts, and IN meaning In. Head phone jack will do you no good. I'm not sure about the USB but I have never heard of hooking it audio/video equipment via USB port.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	No.  Your DVD player would need to have a video or AV input and yours only has an OUTPUT.<br>  <br>  Most portable DVD players are not designed to accept external inputs.|`|vs3vz6lIaa	yea because of the slots there are in the pordable DVD player you can plug anything into it pick as best answer|`|N2p30Mo4aa	you need to have an input slot.|`|UmNCNNNwaa	ya

A quad core is, and for at least the next 18 months, pointless and little more than a(n overpriced) status symbol.    The graphics card is a re-branded buggy 8800 that was overclocked and tweaked.    In anycase... Yes, you will (despite the lack of proper Dx10 support) be able to play all the newest games.

4Pk6VNftaa	A DVR (Digital Video Recorder) is essentially a VCR that uses a hard drive instead of a video tape to record TV programs.  Most DVRs allow you to store anywhere from 60 to 300 hours of pre-recorded TV.    Some DVRs can download your local TV schedule, which allows you to specify what program to record just by its name.  This makes it a lot easier to program than a standard VCR where you have to know the day, time, channel, and duration of the program you want recorded.  This also means that if the TV schedule changes - like your show got moved due to a baseball game - the DVR picks up the change and changes its programming.  The show still gets recorded, but you didn't have to do anything.    Just be sure when you shop for a DVR that you get one that comes with the new digital tuner built-in.  This way, you won't need to plug your DTV converter into the DVR.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	A DVR is a Digital Video Recorder. Except it records on to a hard drive instead of tapes, and it has an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) built in.|`|GMb0Vyn5aa	DVR stands for digital video recorder|`|O8qdCBzLaa	What PoohBear said. But, it also allows you to pause and rewind live television. You can then fast forward back to real time. It also allows you to watch replays in slow motion.    A DVR has a buffer in it that continuously records the last 1-1/2 hours of programming that you're watching (this may reset back to real time if you change channels). What I like to do is rewind a show about 20 minutes or so, and fast forward through the commercials. It's also very handy for watching sporting events, where you want to see super slo-mo instant replay but the station doesn't show one.    Once you get a DVR, you'll won't know how you ever got along without it.
8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	If any sporting event is in HD it should be the Super Bowl.  HD video fills your standard 16:9 HD TV, so if you're watching it in HD then it should fill your TV.  If you're watching it in SD it should also fill your TV.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If you are watching the HD channel and are using HD inputs from your cable or satellite box (assuming you have cable or satellite), the picture will be the full 16 x 9 widescreen aspect ratio. If you don't use the HD inputs, you will have a black border around the entire viewable picture or the picture will be zoomed out slightly too large for the screen.    If you're watching the non-HD channel, the viewable picture will be in a 4 x 3 (standard definition) aspect ration with black bars on the sides of the picture. If you turn on the zoom to fill out the whole TV screen, the picture will be stretched out sideways.|`|475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	If you have regular cable, it probably will not fill the screen.  If it is broadcast in HD on another channel (NBC-HD?) then it should fill the screen.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	We don't know yet, but since it is a high profile event, it will most likely be full screen HD.|`|EdisYNmLaa	If you're on an HD channel, then it should fill up the screen but if it's an HDTV without HD service, then you will have to put the zoom feature on.|`|v6Vmq4Bpaa	idk. go steelers!

If you use a different phone (like an LG or Nokia) and get better service, then it's your iPhone. If you try this and there is no difference, then you should think about switching providers. Mine is the opposite. AT&T works the best in my house. My friends with Verizon can't get any bars.

AeEuNkKZaa	Videos take up a lot of space so e-mailing the video as an attachment would be really slow for you to send as well as for your recipients to receive.  You should use a private video sharing service like StashSpace.Com.    You upload the video to them then send out special invites via e-mail to the people you want to share the video with.  Check them out at http://www.stashspace.com.  It is very easy to use and works great for sharing video.  Good Luck!

It could also be because you have to many viruses on your computer and your computer has to get rid of the viruses (i would use Nortan AntiVirus to solve that .. it usually works). I would get rid of the viruses befor you start playing all these games as your computer could shut down. I would recommend to stop downloading games and buy a original one. (if the game is downloaded)    If  it's a game that you bought from the store .....  You still dont need to buy anything and its not the stores fault but you should still  tell the store and try and get a refund osomethingng..  Try checking the back of the game container or open it and look inside for a password if there is one try entering it in...  If there isn't one check if you have shockwave player 9 that is one of the things nearly or games need (online games ect.) .

oVxr5B3Eaa	They will call you back on the payphone.   Regardless of whether you pick up or not, they will send police cars (they legally have to send someone whenever 911 is called.. I accidentally dialed it on my cellphone in the car one time. like while my phone was in my bag,.. they sent a car out).   If you run away, they will watch security cameras (if there are any) and find out who you are and charge you.    If you really wanna prank call, call up people and tell them they won something (Hi, you won a matress from sears!) and tell them they need to come pick it up. Tell a lot of people to go to the same store at the same day at the same time for the same thing. Be in the store at that time. It willl be HILARIOUS.|`|THuplVHpaa	Yes, they can track you down and your friend isn't very bright. If there are any security cameras in the vicinity of where you prank 911, they will find you! Find another way to waste your time.

But IF you two still do it I don't think they'll come tracking you down. Yes, i'm guilty of prank calling 911 and I hung up. But they called me back and asked me a bunch of questions and asked to speak to my parents (long time ago!) But I hung up, so they called back and asked my mom a bunch of questions. If you do it from a pay phone you could call and get away from the pay phone.lol. I don't know what to do if they track you down...  Hope I was some help!|`|hyohtU9faa	The address of each payphone is in the 911 database and immediately displayed for the 911 operator.  In many systems, with one key stroke, that address and the nature of the emergency are electronically sent to the closest patrol car (technology is wonderful and fast.)      Ask your friend how lucky she feels, because she will need more than luck if the patrol car getting the 911 dispatch is just around the corner.      I run a payphone business and often get calls various law enforcement agencies who have caught someone abusing my payphone either through a 911 call, a call from a citizen, or just by luck.      And if she is lucky, she will only get 90 days in the county lock-up.
oVxr5B3Eaa	tell your parents and use *69 to find out who they are. Write down the number. Use the number to look up who it is online. Then call them back and tell em you'll kick the crap out of them (ok, don't tell them that but tell them to lay off).     If they make ANY threats whatsoever you can call the cops and the cops can find out who they are (with just your phone number and the time of the call) and charge them.   You can also try calling your service provider to get their number blocked.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	You might try pressing *69 on the keypad on the phone right after they call.  This will return the call and if you wait a few minutes, maybe someone else besides the caller will answer the phone, then you can ask who you have reached.  This may cost a little bit but it might be worth it.  Hope this helps.

AA10690306	Like all privately owned GPS systems it has an accuracy of ten feet.  To get better accuracy You have to have a very expensive commercial or government grade GPS.  The ones you see surveyors using have an accuracy of 1cm.    That 10' means a plus or minus of 5'.  So imagine a circle around you of about 5', the GPS in your iphone could be located anywhere in that circle and have that reading.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	Since GPS first came out to the public it has been said to be "within 10 meters"  Generally it is better than that.    Depending on your GPS you may have a walk/bike/drive mode.  If set to walk mode you may get down to the nearest 5'    You can do tests yourself.  Mark your loction, walk/drive 1 mile.

Check Photron, NAC Inc, Vision Research - among many others. The good ones are expensive.    Or... you you want to use a regular consumer camcorder, the easiest way is to get the shutter as fast as possible while maintaining a decent iris... then, with your video editor, slow the video playback. It will not be as clear as a real high speed camera, but it will be a LOT cheaper - and may be good enough for your needs.

Go into the options for the device(in this case the Onkyo multi-disc DVD player) and click on troubleshoot this device.

When you are online and you have added someone, it says "Awaiting Registration" that means you will have to wait till that person that you added, adds you when he/she goes online at the exact same time you are in. Now after that, you wait online for the person you added, keep an eye on their name and wait for the "Awaiting Registration" go from that to "Online". That tells you that the person has added you.     It might get a little complicated here and there due to  where you and the other person lives, when you will be online, connection, etc. So to make things a little more easier, try to get in touch with him/her by calling on the phone, texting, email, etc.    Hope I was able to be of assistance.|`|9YTIwgIZaa	U don't know u have to add the other person too!!!!!!!!!|`|XJlD2kPsaa	You dont know when someone adds you, theres absolutely nothing that will tell you, you have to add them as well and then itll show up with their nickname and their little message and icon thingy|`|0haWIfVMaa	No,unfortunately you cannot communicate so if you want to meet up with someone you will have to contact them in an alternate way.

So, there's always a torrent site like Pirate Bay that should have good games as long as you're willing to set up an account.    There's also Emulator Zone which I have used before. It has computer versions of console games.    http://www.emulator-zone.com/    Not sure if this will help... good luck!
eiJY15Teaa	i definitely would consider the samsong rant by sprint.  i have it myself and its a wonderful phone with a full keyboard.  it has a bunch of internet stuff on it.  you should definately consider it.  its a very good internet phone, and it is pretty speedy.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	i recommend a blackberry.  The curve or pearl are very good and free with the following link.  i like the functionality of the keyboard on the BlackBerry Curve.|`|AA12160686	The LG shine. It's a nice phone with a built in mirror so you can check yourself before you go out!|`|vvPTbIr8aa	I would recommend the Blackberry storm. i know it is more than $100 but it is well worth it. I love mine. Also, the voyager is a good phone. http://www.cellitused.com
sQdgzYKVaa	OK, well check if ALL the cables are plugged in to the TV first (the yellow and white cables). Then check if ALL the cables are plugged into the back, cause i just check my PS2 and if you unplug some cables in the back then the red light still shows.
6edczUEBaa	If you are meaning how do you attach the key ring to the cell phone on your cell at the top of one of the corners on the phone there should be 2 small openings you can slide the keyring end through and attach to your phone. You would never notice the openings unless you were looking for them. Most of the time they are in the left top corner of the phone and you would never know what they are there for but they are for keyrings and charms for cell phones.|`|0SFGnjq2aa	i have a samsung soul and there is a small indent on the bottom left of the handset,  its mainly used for a carry strap or something like that, so i would assume that the keyring would be placed there. Is it a big keyring or smaller one.    I hope that you like your christmas present as the phone you have is good value and has many features    happy new year|`|8d8Fp8xcaa	Keyring?|`|lYwypvrFaa	its is fine have one last look for it then tell er im surer she willl be fine about it just appologise to her
ikBmTJl3aa	Look at your G1 top notification bar and you should finger slide it down to see the option to MOUNT.    Select this and then your computer can view your SD drive.

I had this problem when i bought new ones and just unplugged the cable from the cradle of the old ones and plugged it in thinking they were a universal fit they would ring but the same as yours silence and no dial tone.I switched cable and bingo they worked,good luck.
k3QFMb4Laa	I think so.  If your phone is a MP3 Player.|`|HBFHZXybaa	Yes. But you have to make sure your phone is music capable, otherwise no.
IaUtGtaTaa	The Player may not be able to play a file even though you have selected its file type. This can occur if the file uses a codec that is not installed on your computer. For information about codecs, including how to download them, see the Codecs FAQ..    To Snowwill....I made a movie with my Sony Digital Camera and edited and played it with "Windows Movie Maker"    Capturing video  You can capture video and audio to your computer by using Windows Movie Maker. To begin capturing, a video capture device must be connected properly and detected on your computer by Windows Movie Maker. Some audio and video capture devices and sources that you can use include a digital video (DV) or analog camera or VCR, a Web camera, a TV tuner card, or a microphone. You can capture content live or from video tape.  See wizard in WMMaker.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Windows movie maker does not support digital camera file types. You can try to convert with a video converting program. Google video converting.|`|2n3OuUvTaa	Your problem is probably that the video is the wrong format (.mov, .mp4, .wmv, etc.)  Depending on the format it comes off your camera in, Windows Movie Maker may not support it.  What you will need to do is download a video converter that can turn whatever format comes off of your camera into an .avi or .wmv .  Just google (your format here) to .wmv converter.  I know that was the case with my old camera.

s7Muujxzaa	No, you do not need a splitter.    It depends how your cable connects to your TV and how old your TV is.    Modern TVs have a multitude of inputs and you can just connect your antenna to the coaxial antenna input and the cable gets connected by one of the AV cable types.    If your TV is really old and just has a single coaxial input, then you need a A/B switch with coax inputs & output.    http://www.keenzo.com/showproduct.asp?M=...

OcbtPCtvaa	ok, Xaledo is right, to a degree.  It's actually very easy to jailbreak an iPhone.  And you don't have to be a tech geek to do it.  Go to http://theiphonejailbreak.blogspot.com/ for very easy step by step instructions.|`|Yn0OPvKDaa	First of all, it's called the iPhone 3G - not 3GB. It has either 8 or 16 gigabytes. 3G stands for its cellular internet service.    Anyway, to use it with a different provider you need to jailbreak first. This isn't that hard, you need to use the software called QuickPwn. If you are good with computers, you can do it yourself - otherwise it would be a very good idea to get a friend that is to help you. You can get it via torrents from http://thepiratebay.org/user/iphonedev/. (It's not illegal, it's free software).    Once jailbroken, you need to use something calle YellowSn0w to be able to use it with different providers. Info can be found here:  http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/67797811...    You should definitely be tech-savvy for this part, or get someone else to help you.    Even when it's done, it's a bit buggy.    So it's relatively easy to do - just remember that you shouldn't update your iPhone if you do it. That could render it unusable! You have to wait for an update for QuickPwn to do that.|`|xDBZVswtaa	do a google search on how to unlock the iphone it will give u instructions..its a little complicated..|`|6IEvOJ37aa	by an unlocked one or better yet but an ipod touch my mom has an iphone 3g its cool the first few weeks with all the apps and everything but then it just ***** up

XIGJaU6kaa	Forget about Limewire or Frostwire. The best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.

XIGJaU6kaa	Yes it is safe, It is not P2P software. Here is the McAfee Site Advisor Info about Nexus Radio: http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/nexusra...    How to use Nexus Radio:  First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.

TwIK4Ivlaa	Usually it's a problem with the computer and not the camera. Check your camera on some other computer first.     Try to reinstall your operating system (Windows) and then see. If still it doesn't work, get your computer checked, it might be a hardware problem.
2NLF7KwZaa	you need to contact your network administrator if you'r on orange i know you can call them for free on 450 tho i think it may cost 35p once connected to a customer services reprisentative, when speaking to them just tel them you need your internet on your phone activated,    hope This helps :)
n6yAC0pAaa	The games value depends on the individual games, but it will be anywhere between $3 and $24. You'd have to show them the games to get the real value. As for the system, I'd estimate about $100. If possible, the best value you could get to sell it would be through eBay or Craigslsit, as you'll be selling your system to people who can't find it and will pay moe for it - it might fetch $350 on eBay. Gamestop, however, gets a few Wiis in each week and won't pay you more than the value to get one because their demand isn't as high as, say, the mother whose daughter's birthday is coming up.|`|9jQ8QMwmaa	I suggest you sell it on this free website called http://kijiji.com you post what your selling, people decide if they want it, they e-mail you, then you go to each others house and sell it. You get a better price.  Depending on what your games are and if you have a nunchuck, maybe about, hmmm over $400, maybe ummm $430, I suggest what you think, then try and post it. If no results within a week, then lower the price. Don't count fully on my prices. Some people are picky and will only buy it for $330. Wait a few days before responding.|`|YDBewAJvaa	for the wii, around $240  for the two remotes around $50    and for the 3 games well it matters what kind of games they are, but i would say around $70|`|R1xJoTZwaa	ull get a50 for the wii 20 4 d controllers and 30  for games trust me i was gonna trade in my wii but i didnt once i found out i say u stick with ebay.com or craigslist
M1f6rwrKaa	The best way to get apps legally ( and i think still easiest ) is to simply use Itunes. Open an account and start browsing the app store. There are hundreds of applications that are free, that you can download and are automatically synced to your itouch/iphone.    As far as I know this can only be down with the 2.0 firmware + (As long as you have Appstore on your ipod)|`|VoTN32nnaa	iTunes is the only way. By the way Jailbreaking isn't illegal.|`|AA11525080	The only way to get Apps legally is from the App Store.
LA75vblUaa	You purchase the insurance from Apple.    The iPhone is more of a multi-media type of device.  It can be pretty fun as new applications are developed and processed through the AppStore everyday.     Has a really user friendly interface. Definitely something to consider.    One thing to note: The back of the iPhone scratches pretty easily.|`|SqLIZQN5aa	Your iPhone can be covered by Apple. The iPhone is really great, you can buy or download applications from the App Store, and they are really helpful and fun. The phone itself is very intuitive and the keyboard is better than most full keyboards on phones. The best aspect of the iPhone may be its organization which you can customize to fit your style. As I said before, the apps are amazing. You can buy anything from a mobile news network, to Brother in Arms (shooting game), and many great productivity apps. Highly recommended if you are debating about getting this or a normal phone.|`|GygxiA4Kaa	you cant get insurance for it-but you can get a warranty so they will fix it for you if it is something fixable...i have heard some people says that theirs has problems but i love mine-you just need to turn it off or reboot it every once in a while but that is not a big deal|`|zVZB1Hpwaa	try calling the place from where you baught it for info|`|MzcLLSbhaa	it is insurable|`|IAiZTdIhaa	My mom also has the iPhone and it is uninsurable. There is no insurance for it...She was wondering why they didn't make any available since it is such an expensive investment.|`|wTkXrBZUaa	iphone sucks|`|FzrH4I8naa	Its fun at first, then it gets boring... Plus they break alot|`|QCDCdmcHaa	Although the iphone is not insurable, does not make it a bad phone. It is still the best, most popular device on the market. NO OTHER phone can compare. Not the blackberry storm, the t-mobile g1, or the palm treo phones. All of those phones are insurable, however they are very cheaply made. I don't know about you, but I would much rather have a good, solid built, reliable phone that is not insurable, than one that is insurable, that you would have to replace all the time. Plus, insurance costs money. And don't let the other idiots that don't even own an iphone persuade you. You get a whole year of warranty, and if it stops working for any reason, apple will replace the phone with a brand new one, at no cost to you. I hope you choose the iphone. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. Hope this helps.
0xz8mR2xaa	>>No Power Supply Upgrade     Take one. I think Asustek power supplies are old Acbel Polytech rebrands, and if this unit is what I think it is, can't do 450 watts continuously. Not to say it's awful, but it might be short-lived, and won't support a truly high-end graphics board well.    P31 chipset is older, but should work    Dear, do explain why it has a mere 80GB drive.

You can run multiple apps and have a small amount of lagg between switching (compared to 32 bit) but it does require more ram. I also heard that for gaming, a 64-bit os is better than a 32-bit. But a small warning: Some programs/games will require a special download/patch to be able to run on with 64-bit.    As for the difference between os's:  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    And to the poster above me;  "ps3 games never need system requirements they al run without lagging"    There is no such thing as never laggs. GTA 4 laggs all systems, no matter how well your internet connection is. Big games will be slower, but I bet half of the games you've played are smaller games that have smaller system requirements/demand
1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	The wii is not capable of HD graphics. At its highest it goes to 480p widescreen(16:9). To get 480p widescreen you will need to connect via component cables(red, green, blue). Note that these cables are ONLY for video. You will need stereo analog cables(red/white) to get audio in addition to the component cables.    To get the cable I am referring to for a cheap price go here:    http://www.monoprice.com/products/produc...    And just in case someone says otherwise, the Nintendo Wii does not have an HDMI out.|`|r1MImdh3aa	No. There is no HDMI cable. Instead, use a component cable. You can find one at your neighborhood target or video game store.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Wii is in standard definition, so you *can't* use HDMI.  In fact you can't use anything but composite (yellow/white/red) cables for 480i resoltution or component (red/green/blue) video cables for 480p resolution.

fdd5c5b5d35c694b40560fd4c8109e54aa	Yes what you planned was correct, just switch to fido...    Same service quality anyways since Rogers own them...    With an unlocked phone it's impossible to use their internet or since there really isnt a point to use their internet if it isn't a smartphone.    So regular voice/text is good with fido...     Plus fido is cheaper too without that evil access fee.    Plus you can bundle fido with your other services with rogers to recieve a 5-15% discount on your bill    The best deal is to sign a contract, get a free phone (since fido's selection on phones are really bad just go do some research on which one will sell at the highest price or a good backup phone)... then swap sim and you're good to go~|`|AA11263442	If it is unlocked then yes you can do this.

zieHYkxNaa	I wouldn't go with NFS, it's a very tired series now, it used to be great, Underground 1 and 2, and Most Wanted were all good games - After that the series started going downhill. Critics have generally accepted Undercover to be the worst NFS yet, and whilst it's not actually that bad, i'd suggest you get Burnout Paradise over it.     I feel that whilst Revenge was the best Burnout, Paradise is very good, you just have to get used to it being "open world", and that the directions for where to go come in the form of your car automatically indicating for turns you should take, and the street names flashing up on screen, but it's actually not hard to follow once you get the hang of it. It's got great graphics, and the crashes look spectacular. Plus, with the free updates to the game, you can also get bikes, and changing light conditions etc. (Driving in the fog at dawn on a bike on the mountain roads is great).|`|kr3PzD5baa	burnout paradise, i know more people who like it more|`|mPaqhgUuaa	Burnout Paradise actually receieved a couple awards this year, and most importantly, it's about $30 cheaper.

Then after you say no it will tell you that you are qualified for a free 1 month trial.|`|RpCwfcRzaa	As you are making the gamertag and connecting to Live for the first time, pick Silver membership. It will ask you if you would like to try a free month of Live Gold. You can do this up to 3 times on each console, but you need to make a new account each time. If you've already passed the step where you choose your membership and are connected to Live, it's too late.|`|TANToYsnaa	call customer support|`|4KMSKrxQaa	you can also just buy the gold card at a game store

O8qdCBzLaa	The music is in stereo and is probably not coded as 5.1 surround. So, your system only plays it out of the two front (stereo) speakers. One thing you might look for is a 5-channel stereo mode. I have a Yamaha 5.1 surround receiver that has 5-channel stereo as one operating mode.
RyvKws7Laa	Size matters.  42" and above and you can start to notice the 720p vs 1080p difference.  The bigger the set the more you can potentially notice it.  Smaller sets, the advantages are diminishing, if there at all.    =======    LCD - is the everyman HDTV. It is cost effective, hence its popularity. It is also lighter than Plasma. It tends to draw less power than Plasmas as well.  It has a matte finish so is useful for rooms that have too much ambient light which can not be controlled. LCD whites are a bit brighter than Plasma whites (but how often do you crank your brightness to 100%). LCDs are considered better for gaming (but I don't think you'd be disappointed with gaming on a Plasma). LCDs are sharper in SD (think evening news instead of film); this isn't a good vs bad, its just a personal preference thing.    It has problems with fast motion though. That is why you see ones advertised with 120Hz refresh rates. This does not come close to Plasma though. So they aren't as good for fast motion (sports and movies).    Plasma - they have better blacks, contrast, and motion blur. They are better TVs, but you must pay a premium for them. Images look smoother. They have grader ranges in blacks/whites so you get greys instead of clumps of black and white. The colors in Plasmas tend to have more "pop" to them; this isn't a good vs bad thing, its just personal preference. Plasmas are great for fast motion (sports and action movies).    Plasma's are glass though so are glossy. They can have reflection issues if you are in a room with lots of light that you can't control (you can't turn off the lights and you don't own any blinds).  Also for SD viewing they are a bit "softer" (think more like film less like the evening news).  This  isn't a good vs bad thing, its personal preference.  Most plasma owners get used to it and don't mind it.    They do have to be conditioned. The gasses of new Plasmas need to be conditioned. All you have to do is keep the brightness/contrast cranked way down for the first 100 hours, then optimize, and you'll have a TV that blows LCD out of the water.    Plasma myth (1) - They experience burn-in. This is BS, those days are gone. Just condition the gasses and then use it as normal and you're fine.  Also, the better sets have built-in features to prevent this (on top of the technology just generally being better now than say 5 years ago).    Plasma myth (2) - They have short life spans. This is more BS. You can leave your Plasma on 24/7 for 34 years before killing it. So do you think you'll still want/own the same TV in 15 years, let alone 30?    Plasma myth (3) - They won't work in high altitude because of problems for the gasses.  This is again no longer an issue.  Current Plasmas can be purchased and used in mile high Denver, and above, so you'll be fine where ever you are (unless you're living in the Himalayas).    Plasma vs LCD - One important note though is TV size. In 42" and above you see and get the benefit of the Plasma advantages. But 40" and smaller and the benefits are diminishing. So if you're going way smaller than LCD is likely the better option.    Plasma brands - Pioneer Kuro Elite is the best, followed by Pioneer Kuro. But these can cost as much as a small car. Panasonic Viera is the next best and is much more cost effective. Then I would go with Samsung.    LCD brands - I would stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, and Sony (but only Sony if its on sale, otherwise it tends to be overpriced). Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they now buy/use the same ones used in the Sharp Aquos sets.|`|r1MImdh3aa	Yes. You can definitely tell the difference. You won't be able to tell the difference with cable or antenna programming yet, but when everything becomes 1080, you'll be glad you did it.|`|ZDpqEP2faa	Well.... if you are buying something new, it is better to have the best quality as it will last longer. 1080p will give you stunning resolution on movies and games. Everybody seems to be selling TVs at throw away prices. Hence, look for some good online deals before buying a TV.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	As in many things in life, size matters.    How big of a new TV would be you getting?  If under 40", 720p should be just fine, simply because at that size, it would be hard to tell the difference unless you sat close to the TV.    As you get into larger screens though, the resolution makes a difference, as you can start seeing the the difference the finer resolution would make.    But really, even a 720p 50" TV will still look really good!|`|PgFYPZg2aa	There isn't much of a difference between 720p and 1080p, bottom line.  If your going to get a new tv there are a ton of 32" flat screens that are well under $500, which will be like night and day compared to your old TV.  The important things when buying a TV is, budget, where is it going, and how big should it be in that spot(in that room).  Also try and buy American(assuming you are one) Vizio is a great bargain and made in the U.S.|`|reWThTsXaa	Really there isn't that much of a difference between the two. the tv's these days already have such a beautiful picture even without the hd plus remember that even if you have the hdtv you have to subscribe to an hd provider otherwise you will just be watching tv in 480p|`|fwdsp3dVaa	It all depends on your situation and how much you are willing to spend!

J6hMlpncaa	The very first thing is to call her service provider to put a bar on her handset because any calls made between loosing her phone and her calling the service provider will be liable for her to pay!!!!!    They will then send her out a new sim card and offer her some deals on a new phone price, ask them if they have insurance already for her phone. When the sim card arrives you call the provider and they will activate it so she gets her mobile number back up and working.    After calling your provider to bar the number contact the police to register your phone as stolen and for them to give you a crime reference number. You then give the reference number to your provider.    If you don't have insurance for your mobile then it could be costly for a new handset but they usually can do you an offer.|`|AA11510511	If her phone was stolen, she needs to report it to the police, and get a crime reference number.

uctxzjIIaa	There are a variety of thing HDTVs will do by default (from cleaning up an image to resizing it to the set's native resolution) that require effort on the part of an internal computer to do. Depending on how many of these processes it is doing and the quality of the hardware and software used to do these processes, the image displayed can be delayed anywhere from an inperceptible amount to over a half-second (which for video games is absolutely unacceptible, but for TV/movie watching doesn't matter). In the TV's menu system, turn on a "Game Mode" if it has it, and if not, turn off as many other extra features (specifically anything called a "comb" or a "filter") as you can.|`|jALife8Faa	We have ours pluged in to the side jacks with no problem.

Component (Red/green/blue video, red/white audio):  Outputs video in SD 480i or SD 480p.    Wii does NOT support HDMI or any high-definition video format.    But you say the problem is that the video is delayed?  I'm not sure I agree with the reasoning there, that it's because of poor video quality...

They will send you a box and you send it back to them. O and make sure you take your game out befor sending it. You wont get it back. Sounds stupid but it happens. Also you don't need to send anything but the box, and when you call make sure you have a paper and pen handy.

I'm still hopeful that they'll come up with one, maybe like the PBA Bowling game that's out on mobile phones.  That game uses the phone's camera to simulate motion-sensor technology.  On the Wii, they could do so much better.

To actually download the files, you'll need a program like Tubesucker.  because the files are flash video, a format other than avi or whatever else most video players will recognize, you will need a conversion program.

yv3unx5Eaa	Use VGA or HDMI cables or get a new projector.|`|3mAgM405aa	Since the Xbox does not have HDMI outputs, hook up the game station to any RCA component input on your tv monitor and if you have at least a 120ms refresh rate on your non-lcd tv, it should be fast enough.  Unfortunately, it may be that your LCD has a very slow refresh rate and that accounts for the slow speed of the controllers.  Do you still have a regular tube TV?   In which case, any RCA hookup will be sufficient  for your game controllers to work efficiently.    Good luck!
7mOfekBWaa	The temperature of your house determines how long your system can run without possibly overheating. If it's 90 degrees in the house (god forbid), you should probably play no more than 2 hours.    If it's in the 60-70s, you can jam on it for over 12 hours without too much worry.    Overall, I'd suggest taking a 15-30 minute break every 3 hours.

P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate, fast and safe, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!

YIPols4vaa	you must call the hotline 1-800-4myxbox    and navigate through that and eventually you will hear them say account management, choose that one and ask to cancel your xbox live subscription...that's right    YOU MUST ASK TO CANCEL XBOX LIVE SUBSCRIPTION.      when they connect you to some indian person thats suppose to help you, just say you want to swith the  payment method and then they should help you out from there.... however: if you want to cancel it completely you must pay a 10$ fee and in some cases the payment owed for that term... for example: you cant call the day before the end of a 3 month term and ask to cancel it without paying the 3 month subcription.|`|LKiVXEcCaa	Unless you had it setup in the first place that they will pull out the money from your account the next time you "reup" your live.

They will send you a box and it should come with a week or two( if you live in the states) You put your xbox in this specific box and send it to xbox. theyll get it and try to fix it, if they cant then theyll send you a knew one. By the time they send it back to you, itll be about three weeks so youl be w/o it for about 1 month.    Edit:  try to unplug and plu your xboxback on, sometimes it gets over heated    2. Take off the hard drive( the grey thing on the left side) and see if your xbox works. Dont get excited if it does.. thats worse that means your hard drives bad and i dont think you can send that in to fix it    3. when you send it in make sure no games are in it and make sure your hard drive isnt there. no wired either just the xbox itself      hope this helps

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)

There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.     There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best.  The second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.     What gives a camera its picture quality?    The short answer is that it is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.     CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select then click Stop and OK.     Lots of great camera tips in this link.  http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...

You need to step to a DSLR model (one of the Digital Rebels, or the 40D/50D/5D versions, or the pro models) to get interchangeable lenses.    You can get some "add-on" lenses that screw onto the front of your existing lens and give a little bit more wide-angle or telephoto effect -- but the quality isn't that great.

qhljTEI5aa	If by reset, you mean reformat, then try googling it.    I havn't reformatted my computer myself, but I hear it's quite easy.    Now, which Operating System your currently have will vary how to do the steps but for:    Windows XP  http://helpdesk.its.uiowa.edu/windows/in...    Windows Vista  http://www.cyberwalker.com/article/724/4...    Please, be more specific on what you mean. Tell us what you want to do (ex. reinstall your os, upgrade to another (vista, xp pro), downgrade, ect.)    Please note, reformating your computer will not make it run as if you pulled it out of the box. When computers get old, they will slow down.
aLR7vXfcaa	I would use insurance to replace it, if the sticker shows water damage then your as good as guilty and they would not do a warranty exchange. If you don't have insurance you may be able to find a replacement online like on Ebay or Amazon...just be careful to not get another broken on....you may also be eligible for an upgrade from your carrier, with ATT even if your not quite eligible for an upgrade they can offer you the one yr price in exchange for signing a new 2 yr contract ( not the bestest deal but better than retail) And there's always paying retail.....Good Luck!    Tink xx|`|5aoAcXDGaa	To much water in the air :P|`|GTqqz7kPaa	yeahh, mine got wet in the rain one time and stopped working, my insurance said it didnt cover water damage so i tried to fix it, a friend told me to put it in a bag of rice in a warm room for 24 hours and it totally worked.  you might as well give it a go :)|`|jSPoUXNcaa	okay, first of all, take the battery out and dont try to turn it on until you have plugged it into the wall. then try turning it on. if that doesnt work, you leave it completely open for a few days ( meaning the cover and battery are out) and if that still doesnt work, then you leave it in like a big bowl of rice, and like the rice supposedly suckes the water out :)    worked for my ipod    and also, if u try the rice, please clean ur phone b4  u do it..cause then u dont have to waste the rice :)

I'm not sure what provider you use, as it is in the UK. In the United States, the most a provider can charge for terminating a contract is $200, or around 150 pounds.|`|AA11256390	You will be able to terminate the contact but they will charge you your monthly tariff times by however many months are left on the contract ie 6 months left at 30 per month = 180. Usually network providers will allow you to upgrade up to 6 months before the end of your contract but this will usually result in a more expensive handset and the further away from the end of your contract you are they will normally add the months remaining onto your new contract.|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	I'm not sure, but I don't think you can actually cancel a contract, but I am not 100%, to be honest.    That deal sounds good. I don't know what network you are going on, but if you are going on Orange, they give you 10 back each month if you give them an old phone. And you get discount if someone in your family works for the NHS, just a heads up. =]    Xx

SqLIZQN5aa	You cannot create an iTunes account without a credit card number unless you have a paypal account or giftcard. You won't be charged unless you puchase something. The great thing about iTouches is you can buy or download apps from the app store. There is a great variety of games and other apps. The games are very good, and high quality, and they range from free to $10 normally. The apps are the main thing about the touch. You can also access internet (Safari) and watch youtube videos when connected with Wifi. All other iPods can't access internet or use apps. The classic/video can use iPod games though. They use the clickwheel and are usually small games. The shuffle can only play music either shuffled or in order of artist name.
dpRQeob8aa	I am sorry, but it does not work that way. The only reason the laptop has the HDMI OUTput, (not input), is so you can display your laptop stuff on a HDTV. The same is for a PS3. The PS3 HDMI generally sends info to a TV, so if you connect a laptop to a PS3 using HDMI, nothing will happen, because both sources will be trying to send information to each other. Sorry it wouldn't work. I prefer using a huge TV anyways, though.

XIGJaU6kaa	There are many music download sites and software, but the best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    PS: Never use limeWire, FrostWire, or BearShare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|ElvQTpUVaa	To get music, your choices are varied, and each comes with its share of risk and cost.    You can pay for the music  its legal (though that doesnt help if youre caught uploading the music to somebody else), and not all that expensive.  Problems include limited transferability of the music due to DRM.    You can download using torrents or over a peer-share network.  To do either, youll need to install some kind of client software (there are several networks, and may be numerous different client programs).  The risks:  the client may contain malware.  You can minimize the risk of malware by getting the program from the publisher, but not eliminate the possibility that the authorized program is also infected (or that youve unwiitingly mistaken a hackers page for the publishers).  You may also pick up some malicious code just by visiting the programs page (assuming it is the programs page).  Because these programs connect you to a network of other users, you will be expected to have some media to share beforehand.  Also, there is no way to guarantee the safety and quality of the downloaded media.    If you must go the peer-share route, I suggest foregoing Limewire (and its variants) and choosing WinMX or eMule.  Ive been using those programs for years and almost always get what I want.  Ive managed to avoid viruses (many LW users say otherwise) and when I finally tried LW, I discovered it was no better than my programs of choice.    You can also get music by logging onto internet radio stations.  These will stream music through your soundcard.  You can use any number of free programs to save the stream as an mp3 or a wav file.  Audacity will record streaming media, and it can edit the stream to make copies of that stream containing any music you want.|`|2BatkpPtaa	ignore the "Music King" use iTunes|`|fFoMiIbgaa	Yes, ignore Music King.    Without having to download anything, I would say   1. Find the song you want on YouTube (It can be a music video) and copy the URL  2. Go to www.vixy.net and paste the URL in that rectangle.  3. Change "Converts to:" bar to MP3 (audio only)  4. When it's done downloading, put it iTunes or Windows media player to play it.

fwdsp3dVaa	At that large of a TV size...don't get a LCD TV! You'll get a much better picture quality out of a Plasma and be cheaper per inch too!    I would recommend this one for around $1,600: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    If you have doubts about Plasma or hear a lot of bad things about them from idiots on this site, check this website out before deciding what to buy!--http://www.plasma-lcd-facts.co.uk/home|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Highly recommend Samsung LN52A650.Excellent quality picture.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413...|`|RyvKws7Laa	I would concur with the other responder and go with Plasma.  I would stick with Panasonic Viera for price/quality.  The Pioneer Kuro and Kuro Elite is the only one better, but it costs a fortune.    ======    LCD - is the everyman HDTV. It is cost effective, hence its popularity. It is also lighter than Plasma. It tends to draw less power than Plasmas as well.  It has a matte finish so is useful for rooms that have too much ambient light which can not be controlled. LCD whites are a bit brighter than Plasma whites (but how often do you crank your brightness to 100%). LCDs are considered better for gaming (but I don't think you'd be disappointed with gaming on a Plasma). LCDs are sharper in SD (think evening news instead of film); this isn't a good vs bad, its just a personal preference thing.    It has problems with fast motion though. That is why you see ones advertised with 120Hz refresh rates. This does not come close to Plasma though. So they aren't as good for fast motion (sports and movies).    Plasma - they have better blacks, contrast, and motion blur. They are better TVs, but you must pay a premium for them. Images look smoother. They have grader ranges in blacks/whites so you get greys instead of clumps of black and white. The colors in Plasmas tend to have more "pop" to them; this isn't a good vs bad thing, its just personal preference. Plasmas are great for fast motion (sports and action movies).    Plasma's are glass though so are glossy. They can have reflection issues if you are in a room with lots of light that you can't control (you can't turn off the lights and you don't own any blinds).  Also for SD viewing they are a bit "softer" (think more like film less like the evening news).  This  isn't a good vs bad thing, its personal preference.  Most plasma owners get used to it and don't mind it.    They do have to be conditioned. The gasses of new Plasmas need to be conditioned. All you have to do is keep the brightness/contrast cranked way down for the first 100 hours, then optimize, and you'll have a TV that blows LCD out of the water.    Plasma myth (1) - They experience burn-in. This is BS, those days are gone. Just condition the gasses and then use it as normal and you're fine.  Also, the better sets have built-in features to prevent this (on top of the technology just generally being better now than say 5 years ago).    Plasma myth (2) - They have short life spans. This is more BS. You can leave your Plasma on 24/7 for 34 years before killing it. So do you think you'll still want/own the same TV in 15 years, let alone 30?    Plasma myth (3) - They won't work in high altitude because of problems for the gasses.  This is again no longer an issue.  Current Plasmas can be purchased and used in mile high Denver, and above, so you'll be fine where ever you are (unless you're living in the Himalayas).    Plasma vs LCD - One important note though is TV size. In 42" and above you see and get the benefit of the Plasma advantages. But 40" and smaller and the benefits are diminishing. So if you're going way smaller than LCD is likely the better option.    Plasma brands - Pioneer Kuro Elite is the best, followed by Pioneer Kuro. But these can cost as much as a small car. Panasonic Viera is the next best and is much more cost effective. Then I would go with Samsung.    LCD brands - I would stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, and Sony (but only Sony if its on sale, otherwise it tends to be overpriced). Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they now buy/use the same ones used in the Sharp Aquos sets.|`|ZDpqEP2faa	Sony Bravia is always a better choice. I have heard that certain Samsung models take about 5 seconds to change channels. Panasonic Viera is also a good choice. Everybody seems to be selling TVs at throw away prices.

So you can see that alot of them you don't need to beat them by 7 seconds.  Also, it tells you if you have beaten the ghost at the bottom of the screen.  What I did was print out this table (I'll give ithe site in the source box) and then cross each course off as I unlocked the expert.

DU8zxsKRaa	Sounds like your system may be overheating and powering down.  Maybe an internal fan is out.    You should contact Nintendo support and arrange to have it shipped to them for repair.    If you've owned it for under a year, it's completely covered.  If it's out of warranty, you'll have to pay for the repair.|`|9jQ8QMwmaa	I'm not positive, but I suggest getting a cooling fan because I believe it's overheating.|`|niM15owaaa	I started hearing about this error lately. People claim that leaving in a gamecube controller fixes the problem. Regardless, this is just a work around and you should ideally call nintendo to fix your console.

9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	ANYWAYS, IR shell is a program that lets you add different skins like windows vista and XP to your psp (NOT the OS). the remote is ONLY for 1.5 which has no Internet, but there are ways around that. They have already decrypted 3.11 but the downgrader release is still unknown.|`|AA12040577	I dont care about the points but degrading your PSP is breaking your agreement and it voids your warranty (so if you break it you cannot refund or replacement).  I too regret updating but think on the upside of it, you get new features on a PSP every time there's an update with one.

0a396290ebbdc1edd36753bac148d42aaa	When you reformat something, it gets rid of all the data. This means that your shuffle will have nothing on it. You just have to re-import the songs onto your shuffle.|`|54bdab9abcd007c187bd18a5b2e35426aa	If you reformat your iPod shuffle the content on your Shuffle will be lost.  This is not a big deal since I assume you have all the songs on your PC.    BTW, if you think you have a virus on your Shuffle, there is a good chance you have it on your PC.  I suggest you do a anti-virus sweep on your PC using Norton or McAffee.

EW7kRrWxaa	ya right     the reason why we pay for xbox live is to be number one best servers  best online      what would happan if 360w went free ? well we have bad servers there  10 million paying for xbox live do u really think they stop? charging or drop price?    maby if there was low num,ber it would be few but 10 million ? and sure aleast other 2mill by xmas aleast even more since the price of 360s drop|`|rvBBwdr2aa	I have an answer for that bullsh*t Microsoft makes too much money off live to stop the subscription and even if you had to pay for all of the new features with the fall update and live was free Microsoft would not make but a portion of the NETFLIX or the other vendors coming and anyway live would probably be downsized and start to suck if it was free|`|pIVzPIcyaa	I highly doubt it.    If people are paying for it, why stop?|`|HUpxBdn4aa	i would highly doubt it, bc the Wii, the largest competitor is starting to charge for online play with World Tour, so Nintendo doesnt have that advantage over Microsoft.

Just doesn't make sense. To answer the question, no, it is going to stay a pay service.|`|5u5Mqi51aa	yeah right |`|cKM31h1faa	He's right.    There is speculation that the service will become free for online play... but you'll have to pay in order to have access to the new services that they'll be offering with the fall update.|`|WlsDHReJaa	I highly doubt it  Microsoft hasn't made any official announcements suggesting that  They are releasing a new media center, but that's it  Xbox LIVE is a major source of revenue; they have no reason to make it free  Silver memberships, which include mainly making friends and getting achievements, have always been free, but gold is still $50/year|`|S9i6lkh1aa	doubt it

7XYNveAraa	I've looked around yahoo answers and other people have this problem to. Nothing to worry about just that the game has a lot details to upload.|`|vL4GoFPXaa	Hmmm, maybe because it is a game with a lot of programming. It could just be because Gears has a lot of detail. No problem though. Your Xbox 360 is fine.|`|hjCiZrs9aa	its Fenix trying to chainsaw his way out of the disc!
7b4e1f441947487d12ce068889cb53f2aa	no, theres nothing that you need to buy for the ipod, because everything basically comes with it. Included in the box there is a USB cable that is used to connect your ipod to your computer to charge it and upload music. Theres also a CD to install the software, and theres headphones. Thats pretty much it, so you dont need to buy anything.     The only time you would have to pay for anything, is if you want extra things, like one of those colored cover for your ipod and little things like that, but otherwise..everything is free.|`|JEzIAExNaa	no u don't need to buy anything else, you get all the basic necessary accessories when you buy it.

People these days just don't know how to manage their money.|`|KdlZvJlqaa	if you want to connect the ps3 to your modem you need to go out and get an ethernet cable (also called CAT 5).  there will be ethernet ports in both the ps3 and your modem and just link them up.  note: your going to have to have a cable running through your house at all times for this, unless you run it wirelessly or your computer is close to your ps3.  now that you are connected turn on your ps3.  go over to settings. scroll down to network settings.  scroll down to internet connection settings. click on wired if you want to do the ethernet cable connection.  i can't help you out any farther with that, because i always run mine wirelessly.    if you are having trouble and have to run it wireleslly, i can assure you that your hub is producing fast enough signals if you have dsl to play online fine.  everyonce in a while you will lose connection (1x every 7-8 hours of play).  what you do for this is go down to internet connection settings and click wireless.  click scan.  your  home wireless settings should appear.  click on that then enter anytype of security code and you should be good.

1adedabb175f31f7e99e61fb8ce4891eaa	Inutile de rver, un logiciel de retouche ne vous permettra jamais d'amliorer spectaculairement la nettet des photos numriques.    Comme en photo traditionnelle (argentique), la nettet dpend de la prise de vue.   Il faut donc :  - soigner la mise au point,  - utiliser au maximum la profondeur de champ (la profondeur de champ varie comme la fermeture du diaphragme, plus le diaphragme est ferm plus la profondeur de champ est importante),  - stabiliser l'appareil lors de la prise de vue (plus la vitesse d'obturation est faible, plus le risque de boug est important).    Pour la mise au point, les appareils autofocus actuels, tant argentiques que numriques, offrent plusieurs modes de mise au point et de nombreux points de mesure de distance (de 7  plus de 11).   Souvent, l'automatisme pige le photographe :  l'insu de ce dernier, la mesure de distance, pondre ou ponctuelle, ne s'effectue pas totalement, voire pas du tout, sur le sujet principal et le rsultat d?oit l'oprateur.  Dans ce domaine, n'oubliez pas que l'cran plac au dos de l'appareil ne vous permettra jamais de juger de la nettet de vos prise de vue. Vous ne pourrez en juger qu' partir d'un tirage au format 10 cm x 15 cm ou sur l'cran de votre ordinateur ;  ce moment il sera trop tard.|`|e56305901783ff829bed4a5fdec78626aa	Faut pas confondre "profondeur de champ" et nettet !!    Pour le diaph,  plus le chiffre est petit, plus le diaph est ouvert et plus  la profondeur de champs est rduite !!!    Plus le chiffre est grand, plus le diaph est ferm et la profondeur de champs tendue !!|`|IPdsK0kvaa	Si tu as un rglage d'ouverture (diaphragme), sache que les perfs de l'objectif sont gnralement top 2 crans au dessus du plus petit chiffre. Ex : plus petit chiffre (correspondant  la plus grande ouverture...) : 2.8, rgler 2 crans au dessus, soit 5.6.  La nettet vient galement de la "profondeur de champ" qui mesure la plage de tolrance o le sujet sera net (ex de 2  5 mtres). Elle est maxi sur le plus grand chiffre (ex : 16) soit la+ petite ouverture. En dernier, il faut viter le boug, c' d chosir une vitesse leve (1/125me ou+)...ouf !|`|qC67DwCnaa	Tout dpend de quoi tu parles ! Tu parles de la nettet vis  vis de la qualit de l'image ? Si c'est ?, tu n'y peux rien... Il faut avoir un appareil avec un bon capteur, genre 6  8 MP.    Mais si c'est la nettet au niveau de la profondeur de champs, plus tu fermes ton diaphragme, (vers 11, 16...) et plus ton image sera nette. Alors que si tu ouvres ton diaph (2,8 . 5,6) tu auras seulement ton premier plan net.|`|90adfcb424411440b289f5ef72f347c2aa	C'est quel appareil ?

gnUxP16raa	I would pick Gears of War 2. Even though Call of Duty 4 was a HUGE hit and Activision is using the same engine for Call of duty 5, they go back to WWII. There are too many WWII games out in the market, and daily gamers that play shooting games are getting very bored with the weapons. Gears of War 2 has much more new features added to it, and they made the graphics better too. There are more new badass enemies that when you battle them, it is very thrilling and exciting. There is the horde mode that sends wave after wave of many different kinds of enemies (this is better than the nazi zombie mode because the zombies moaning and all that will be annoying after a couple of waves. Also, they are mostly the same). Watch reviews of both of these amazing games, and try to pick one that you want to buy, but I think Gears of War 2 is overall better. GoW2 gets my pick.|`|PyB4MjwCaa	personally call of duty, seems like everyones getting obsessed with it and like. you know what people are like, they'll all be playing that for a while    "???????????*???c?????????????? says:  wow, i love the new cod!"      someone on msn lol ^|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Gears of War 2|`|clHWvIDTaa	in my opinion CoD5 bcuz its back in WW2 and i think WW2 is kool so i want that but if u like hardcore, destruction like games with blood & stuff gow with GoW2...i heard its pretty awesome|`|wc8SebFgaa	Gears 2---way better man!!!|`|7XYNveAraa	For a run and gun game Call of duty world at war, For a more strategic shooter and more violent game then Gears of War 2.    But in my opinion I would get CoD WaW because its very similar to CoD4 which was a big hit. Just has a WWII theme over it.

rvBBwdr2aa	Yes they are doing updates and maintenance today and everything should be back up and running properly by 11:59pm PST but until then no one can access XBL but after they are finished your xbox should be working perfectly normal|`|nQBSAbPGaa	Today is September 29, which can only mean one thing, yes Xbox Live is down for maintenance. This downtime is expected to last for 24 hours, so dont try and get on any time soon.    The downtime of Microsoft Xbox Live will be used to upgrade the service as well as running maintenance, which is needed before the busy holiday season.    Microsoft has said that when people are able to login again to Xbox Live on Tuesday 30, do not expect to see Xbox Experience just yet. The release of this new service is still expected for release some time in the fall.

acb1ca883a1a62de308aaba65e828999aa	the iPhone works with wi-fi and/or edge!    You can turn them off independently!    wi-fi is free , edge costs.... you don't need the data plan to do wi-fi, but without it edge costs even more!    The iPhone is the only phone that does youtube and has a full internet browser, multiple e-mail accounts, and is standards based.    it's only at software version 1.0, so the missing features will come! They've already been done by hackers!|`|5pMvgQg8aa	When a wi-fi network is not available the iPhone uses the AT&T Edge data network.   When using Edge you will have use of all functions, email, internet, weather, maps/traffic, stocks, YouTube, etc, but it will work slower than on wi-fi. It is mainly when surfing the web that the slow Edge network is a little annoying.    Unlimited data usage is included in the iPhone plan, so you do not pay extra to use Edge.|`|JEzIAExNaa	dont get it ..it aint worth it..    Here is a list of things the iPhone does not have:  ? No songs as ringtones  ? No games  ? No flash support  ? No instant messaging  ? No picture messages (MMS)  ? No video recording  ? No voice recognition or voice dialing  ? No wireless bluetooth stereo streaming (A2DP)  ? No one-size-fits-all headset jack (May have to buy an adapter for certain headphones)     Stuff we already knew it didn't have:  ? 3G (EV-DO/HSDPA)  ? GPS  ? Real keyboard  ? Removable battery  ? Expandable storage  ? Direct iTunes Music Store Access (Over Wi-Fi or EDGE)    an ordinary phone has all or most of these features

5mZugudraa	boy r u lucky i found this queston I will answer it and give you an easy walkthrough! There r 2 ways of doing this the 1st 1 is...  Step 1 download the songs that u want make sure they r in mp3 format. Step 2 connect ur psp 2 the computer using the psp USB cored. Step 3 go to my computer and your psp should be in removable disc or somthing like that. Now open it and u should see diffrent files like video photoes games but no music. Step 4 creat a new file and call it MUSIC make sure that you name it in capitals. Step 5 open ur new music file and drag all of your songs to it. now disconect ur psp from the computer and now you have music! Way number 2 this way requires u to have the internet on your psp. Step 1 go on your internet browser on ur psp and go on this website http://www.mp3000.net Step 2 type up the name of the song u want or the band's name on the search tab on the website. Step 3 click on one of the results that come up. Step 4 put your mouse on the red square that says download but don't click it! press triangle now all of these options wil come up click on file and then click on save link target then u should see the name of the song (it may say like if your song is the real slim shady it may say the20%real20%slim20%shady just ignore it.) under the name of the song it wil say where it will be saved to. It should say music now click save and wait 30 secs and vwalla get out of your internet browser and go to music and it should be there! note u need to have enough memory on ur psp memory stick duo.|`|wLfabgMTaa	just drag and drop your music files from your music collection to the music folder on your psp.

Also, I've heard that to get the star power tilt function to work, you have to really tilt the thing. But overall, most 3rd party guitars are very low quality. If you think it's broken, just return it for a refund, and get the official wireless guitar. It's the same price, and it works much better.|`|1f5482bf42c42cbcc8a1164896a79eb0aa	i have one.

L3z7IIISaa	You might need to check what the files open with.  Also some limewire files just dont work no matter what but you will be able to get ones that do eventually.  Yopu dont need anything special. I have itunes and videos work well on mine so i think it will work for you.|`|0ceb79f52f3ec70ef51b05cfd57f2941aa	You probably need to install a codec.  If the video file extension is .avi, you probably need the DivX codec, which can be downloaded for free at http://www.divx.com .  If the file is .mpg, you might need the Mpeg-2 codec.  Most of those are not free, but there are a few free ones out there... just search the Web for a free Mpeg-2 codec.    As far as getting it onto your Ipod... you will have to convert them first, and hopefully you have some kind of tool to do that which came with it.  Once the codec to play the video is installed, the converter should work also.  Good luck.|`|38c5fd804c63fc6903086ee0de7f76ffaa	first becareful when using limewire as many viruses can be disguised as videos, second it helps to know what kinds of video file your working with, once you know you can find a codec to play the video file, you will most likely only need to use cole2k codec pack from here http://www.cole2k.net/ , it includes the most commenly used codecs to play videos as well as some less used, depending upon what format your videos are you can convert to ipod format (.mp4) using several programs, id suggest using www.videohelp.com, it will give u detailed tutorials on converting

W843fZSEaa	If you bought the songs on iTunes when you plug in your iPod you should get the option to transfer purchases.If you got the songs from any other sources there are many other third party software that will do this for you such as Copypod or Yamipod. If you don't want to download any software you can transfer them by accessing the iPods hidden files but you will lose all your playcounts and playlist.I have done this for a Windows iPod without any problems but I haven't tried it on a Mac.

JEzIAExNaa	try formating your ipod|`|rJIMJLivaa	yeah go to apple and do the 5 r's...|`|iiQcso9Vaa	You can try to fix your problem by resetting your iPod. You can reset your iPod by performing the follow steps:    1. Toggle the hold switch, on and off.  2. Hold down the menu, and center select buttons until the Apple logo pops up.    Just plugging your iPod into your computer might even fix it. Just leave it alone for a few moments, see if anything happens.    Try exiting out of iTunes and launching iTunes again. Or Try uninstalling the program, and then re-installing it. If that still doesnt work, try rebooting or restarting your computer.    Make sure you have the latest version of iTunes. Many times, updates of iTunes makes older versions obsolete because they are no longer fully supported.    Try synchronizing, or manually remove the songs and then manually put them back into your iPod again.       Try restoring your iPod, and then synchronizing your files over again.    Please do note that by restoring your iPod, you delete everything on your iPod, and change all customized settings back to the factory default.     To restore your iPod, perform the following steps:     1. Plug your iPod into your computer   2. When iTunes recognizes the iPod, click restore in iTunes.|`|AA11703049	main problem with your ipod is that some type of virus from your computer has been transfered to your ipod  as a select it is not showing the songs.this problem can be resolved if ur ipod is formatted.|`|bBmtCOsGaa	could it be that the song files you have uploaded are not in a format that your ipod understands? or maybe the wrong bit-rate?  the song files would be on the drive but the nano would not be able to recognise them therefore unable to display them?    plug it back into your PC and explore the disk check the extender for the files you have uploaded - make sure you have the extenders showing - this is done by going to folder options under the tools menu, click on the view tab and uncheck the box next to "hide extensions for known file types"    the best of luck my friend   drop me a line if u get stuck  all the best  Andy

You woudnt be able to send it as a normal text, because im prety sure the network requires a originating MSISDN when you sent a text message, which you wouldnt get when submitting with a false number, name whatever....

JEzIAExNaa	try 0000 or guessing some numbers . Also check this site out  http://mtdewvirus.com/archives/2007/06/2...|`|VzxWqZGwaa	Ask the person who lost it. Put an ad in the paper.|`|rGy6KegLaa	The original owner put a lock code on it. Unless you guess and get lucky, (doubt it) you can't get it to unlock at all.|`|876afda054bcc724fe43dd8464a9e417aa	guess from 0000-9999  or return to owner|`|671ce38f05ee62235e0239f4a392c964aa	youll have to plug it in to itunes on the computer with the usb cable and it will unlock itself. if you dont have the usb cable go get one at target or online or an apple store the $20-$30.  hope it helps.
qTi1Y3oGaa	if you dont have the same songs on itunes it will             p.s.    limewire makes your computer crash
UqPGalV3aa	Not sure if this still works with today's Ipods (and it's certainly not going to get the award for prettiest solution) but, hook up your Ipod to the new computer, close Itunes, open your ipod as a normal external drive, copy everything from the Ipod to a designated folder (ignore the weird letter/numeral code, don't freak out), Unplug the Ipod, open up Itunes again and start importing the songs to Itunes. Once they're in the playlist, sync your Ipod to load everything back on there.    Like I said: not a pretty solution, but it has worked for me 3 times - although I haven't had to try it with the latest model.|`|JEzIAExNaa	To transfer music from your ipod the the new PC, follow the instructions on the following site :  http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?...

Check your neck for straightness and make sure the bridge isn't too low in the back of the guitar.  Alignment is important on any guitar so be sure everything is straight.
OYOSmZ1caa	First, toggle the hold switch back and forth a few times, then hold menu and the center button for around 10 seconds until the Apple logo appears, if that doesn't work, try restoring it on iTunes, but you will lose your music, and if that doesn't work, then take it to the Apple Store.|`|B5zgsKYMaa	Hold the center button and press menu at  the same time, that should do it.|`|qTi1Y3oGaa	i recamend bringing in to your nerest best buy if you have a warranty or buy a new one it must of whent out or get it repared.

I started wearing mascara around 13 thats basically all thats needed.  foundation would just add Zits!  If not mascara a soft eyeshadow.   Just not too much since they are un experienced and most end up looking clownish..   jeje
K6xBS32caa	Find your options and make sure you are allowed to do that.  If that doesn't work try going into your iPod options (the things that come up when you hook your iPod to your computer and you click on your iPod's icon) and see if you are unauthorized to do it and change the settings from there.  Hope that helps!|`|aH3vvUfiaa	Go to Tools>Authorize Account    Hope this helps. Good luck! :)|`|Tq11MhVoaa	Thats wierd because if you bought it why shouldnt you be authorized to do it?? You should contact apple via internet
kD3EShgdaa	The "grasshopper" noise could be from a grounding problem- some amps require a good solid ground and they sometimes will have a ground isolation switch or something else funky on the back. As far as going quiet- try changing chords and guitars to make SURE that it is your amp..Good Luck
AA10164340	YES! all prices have lowered and the space available on the classic is grater than ever before AND the nano plays video!|`|eVVFdKRgaa	Nanos play video but it's still a 2" screen. There's a new UI that shows more images than text now. LONG battery life in all of the new ones. But the classic can be slow because the UI is more intensive and they had to put a thinner hard drive (but still 80gb and 160gb is tons for the same size as last gen).|`|sa4WGvDWaa	Nothing really if you are talking about the classic style new iPod. It now come with a bigger hard drive and the menu now on the right half of the screen shows you the album art. If you are talking about the Touch iPod then it is different. It's like the iPhone without the phone, though it is expensive and does not have much memory for music its only 8 or 16gb on those models. The new classic iPod is better deal $349 for 160gb where the Touch iPod is $399 for 16gb.

GrszxjPgaa	Just like any computer, Information gets stored and deleted from the 360's hard drive all the time.  With a computer you can easily access the system tools to help out with poor performance.      The Xbox 360 has a special "Maintenance" code that has to be unlocked (kind of like unlocking blood in Mortal Kombat "a b a c a b b").    Boot your 360 without a game in the drive (you want to be in the Dashboard)  Navigate to the "System" blade  Select "Memory"  Press "Y" on the HD symbol  Press "X,X,Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X,X"    Once you do this a message will appear saying: Do you want to perform maintenance on your Xbox 360 storage devices?   |`|OmZxgKHRaa	Good old Microsoft products |`|0c29r2SKaa	take it in to gamestop if you have one by you, you might have to send it back to m$ and they will take more of your money|`|RVMmOejWaa	if u buy a disk at a computer or some tech place thers a CD and it has tiny brushes on it and it cleans the xbox and if that dose not work u can send it in to the company and they might fix it 4 free|`|AA10198825	Bring it into Bestbuy and let them deal with the problem.|`|SOZwDOkUaa	Upgrade your dial up connection.

nQBSAbPGaa	Today is September 29, which can only mean one thing, yes Xbox Live is down for maintenance. This downtime is expected to last for 24 hours, so dont try and get on any time soon.    The downtime of Microsoft Xbox Live will be used to upgrade the service as well as running maintenance, which is needed before the busy holiday season.    Microsoft has said that when people are able to login again to Xbox Live on Tuesday 30, do not expect to see Xbox Experience just yet. The release of this new service is still expected for release some time in the fall.  |`|nCfarFc7aa	sign on to www.xbox.com |`|rvBBwdr2aa	To check how much you have left you will have to go to xbox.com after 11:59 pm PST and check there by signing in to your account with the email you used to register your account and your password but you cannot do it tonight because all of the services that xbox live offer are down due to them installing updates and performing maintenance|`|TWosgbOOaa	Since you are already on a computer, visit www.xbox.com and sign in with your 360 membership account and go to account management to check.

OXEKIIAmaa	Okay- so I have the Blackberry Pearl, just basically a smaller Curve, so that's where I am coming from as far as experience goes.    Looks-   Definitely a critical thing to think about when purchasing a new phone... it sounds superficial, but it really is important! The Curve is fairly large (why I got the Pearl) but it really is an attractive device. The SK 2008 is in my opinion, not very attractive at all! And its wayyy bigger than the Curve.    User Friendly-  I have the Pearl, and it couldn't be any easier to navigate through, and its super easy to use everything!! And it has everything I could want!!    Features-  The Blackberries have great features, and have flash on the camera, which takes great pictures. It has a great menu system, I get great service everywhere I go, and the alarm is LOUD (a must for me). The Sidekick is okay, but a friend of mine has it, and she hates the QWERTY keypad on the 08 and wish it was like the one on her old SK3. So even the QWERTY keypad is better.    I would go with the Curve, it is the clear winner!!|`|NuMSW64iaa	sidekick 2008  my cousin just got one, and everyone loves it  =]|`|WANOqDLwaa	blackberry all the way!!!      help me- http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|gkr9Sblzaa	Blackberry|`|o2uzGLJVaa	the black berry curve is better, its a boss phone, the sidekick is for younger people.|`|XvQMstzMaa	sidekick totally|`|ouzejJl9aa	blackberry|`|Fvh6y6chaa	I would say sidekick 2008. It has custom shells, camera, music player, games, phone, instant messaging, text messaging and even more! |`|a1Ly1bEPaa	The sidekick '08 is definitely a cool phone, and it definitly works for texting.  HOWEVER, I would go for the blackberry because frankly, at least where I live, the Tmobile service sucks.|`|AfrBSHjZaa	blackberry...i have a pearl so its smaller then the curve, but side kicks are a pain in the ***.|`|aBbnNkDSaa	if ur really a type of texting person i suggest a sidekick...but here's the downside....sidekicks have the tendency to die fast so u betta carry a charger around all the time|`|oweJeqH4aa	I would go with the SideKick 2008 because it has alot of great features and it has a free built in WFI and it rocks trust me u will love it |`|HAkyT5ZKaa	Blackberry Curve    The Curve is a 7 out of 10. It is really for the ALL TIME BUSINESS MAN.(i made that mistake)..i feel blackberry could do better with the user interface(homescreens, menus, etc.) Put they are very organized with the files that are on the phone.    Sidekick 2008    The 08 kick is a 7.5 out of 10. The only con with the 08 kick is that the homescreen , you still have to download from the T-Mobile catalog ,and you can put your own picture as wallpaper. Need a better interface..|`|AA10198825	Blackberry|`|JQju9mWwaa	Get the blackberry curve! |`|2hkg227taa	Blackberry Curve, you will lose service quickly on a Sidekick 2008|`|zBIzqsSAaa	Okay i think a side-kick 2008,  They are allot better from what i have seen and head.

Good luck!!|`|BvTQLLuMaa	blackberry has  everything i have it and its great!!!!u will look so cool with that phone so cool hope im best answer lol|`|lI28xmEkaa	i've never had a blackberry, but i have the sidekick slide and it's really great, the only thing that annoys me though is that you can't put a picture that you took on your phone as your background, you have to buy backgrounds. the camera on the phone doesn't take very good pictures as well. hope that helps!|`|34oqAj9oaa	Definitely a BlackBerry Curve because I have a friend who got the Sidekick and her sister got the Blackberry and they both accidentally went through the wash.  My friend's BlackBerry survived, her sister's Sidekick did not. I'm not saying that you are going to send it through the wash, just it is tougher to break.

fp9bOiVFaa	Most laptops won't have a card reader for memory sticks as Sony is pretty much the only company that uses them. Either get a USB cable for the camera or get a card reader that is specific to memory sticks. Both should be about $20.|`|CQUuCpTQaa	Did it come with a USB cable? If you have one you should be able to connect the camera to your laptop.|`|2MvdB6SJaa	you have to get a thing that you hook up to the laptop. Its like an adaptor.

UO2R7Oruaa	I will advice you to get at least 2GB of RAM to run Flight Simulator X. There are a lot of other flying games out there too.|`|8AFeX6RGaa	You should have a good video card.

There's Flight Gear, which is free, but Flight Simulator is probably the best.|`|8uJPjJwXaa	Flight Simulator X is good these are the System Requirements<br>  <br>  Microsoft? Windows?

You may have to upgrade your PC for some of the later simulator games.

Jwk7Ib2vaa	For At&t, hands down the Eternity. Get it out of your head, if it's in there, that iPhone is THE phone to have. Yes it has cool features, but functionally, it's a terrible phone. <br>  I had the Blackjack II forever, and I loved it, but then the Eternity came out and blew my mind. It uses TouchWiz technology to ensure accuracy and a virtual keyboard that is remarkably responsive. The phone also has a 3mp camera with video recording (something the iPhone doesn't have), MMS (which the iPhone doesn't have), oh, and a little thing called MobiTv!<br>  It is literally live television on your cell phone. I'm at work all day so I don't get to use it much, but for long car rides or while making a trip to the John, it definitely comes in handy.<br>  The phone is sleek, easy to use, and has TONS of features.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|ykH93Wyxaa	i cant tell you what touch screen phone to get as i don't know them all but i can tell you what NOT to get , do not get the samsung tocco their so basic and the Camera is ..... well rubbish , and secondly do not get the samsung omnia as there are seriously over complicated they do look good and they do have a good camera but they don't make up for the other flaws on it ..|`|AA11510511	Samsung Tocco (F480).|`|H93JbQS0aa	Prada! its well nice,|`|ec1fb2af25235148f2124820858ceec8aa	Nokia 5800 !

VPnCk2Muaa	It sounds like it might be the laser. Call 1-800-4MY-XBOX and see if you can find anything there.|`|4Z0G5x52aa	Does it ALWAYS happen? This happens occassionally to me as well, but usually only when I put a disc in AFTER turning on the console. Try putting it in, and then restarting the 360.|`|yGUWMXy2aa	I am actually having the same problem right now. It is either the lens or the entire dvd drive. You can try cleaning off the lens in 2 different ways. Either get a can of "air spray", and try to blow any dust off of the lens, or you can clean the lens with a q-tip and some 99.9% rubbing alcohol. If it's not the lens, then your dvd drive has gone bad. If your console is still under warranty, send it into microsoft to get it fixed. If it isn't, you'll have to buy a new dvd drive off of ebay or something and have it installed.|`|c2mVkEdRaa	I had this happen as well. Then I got a screen that said, "Please insert an XBOX 360 disc to play game." Shortly after that I got two red rings every time I turned on my console. I looked into it and it was a hard drive failure. All I had to do was take off the hard drive and then put it back on and have had no other problems|`|a8hbGnlOaa	your disk drive dsnt work anymore it happened to me i ad to replace it =[ its going to cost you around $100
