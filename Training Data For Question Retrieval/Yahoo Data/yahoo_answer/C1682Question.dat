20090202133501AAzg9oU	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Should Lisa Lampenelli be censured?	She is an "insult comic" in the tradition of Don Rickles. She is the most foul mouthed, fattest, crankiest, bigot, female comic in the public eye. She cannot be censured. But I can't understand how she is gaining fame and fortune because all the misguided people choose to go to her shows in droves and subject themselves to the same old racist jokes and minority stereotypes. I can't understand why people pay her to be insulted. Some traditions should die. Don't we get enough of that in our own lives?  Insult comics like Don Rickles came from a generation where it was okay to be a bigot. I thought we've come a long way from there. But this time around, it's all the minority groups that are championing her racist beliefs and humor. She is like a yeast infection. You keep scratching it, but she won't go away!

If that is true why do so many people from around the world want to come here? Millions even risk their lives sneaking across the border to get here. It seems like if the US was so mean that people would be trying to leave here instead of come here.

20090202174838AAD6qTE	News & Events;Current Events	Israel now admits to funding Hamas?	 http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.asp...       "The office of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert admitted on Wednesday that it is allowing the transfer of hundreds of millions of shekels to the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip every month.      Most of the funds enter Gaza in currency exchanges for the dollars and euros Hamas smuggles into the territory following fund-raising trips to Iran and other supportive Middle East regimes."         This is sheer genius on the part of Israel really. Fund money to the entity which you claim is your mortal enemy, have them use the weaponry from said funding to attack you with wildly inaccurate rockets, and use that as rationale to continually oppress and subjugate Palestinians under the guise of "security" and launch massive slaughtering campaigns in the territory you occupy.      This is not even including the fact that the Israeli intelligence agency supported the rise of Hamas in the early 80s as a counterweight to Arafat's PLO.      Thoughts?
