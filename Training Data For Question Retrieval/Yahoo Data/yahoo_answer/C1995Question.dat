20090227130337AAbk9uX	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Digital TV not working - DVD recorder?	I have a Sony DVD recorder and it has digital built in, but i'm unable to receive any digital channels. I live in Scotland, and the Government is changing to digital in 1 or 2 years. I have set up the DVD recorder correctly. I can watch DVDs but Digital TV is not working. Today I phoned the Sony helpline, and they suggested I should talk to an aerial specialist. I'm beginning to think the problem is with the aerial that connects from the wall to the DVD recorder. It's quite old and I don't think it's digital, since we've never had digital before. The aerial from the wall connects to the digital aerial input on the DVD recorder. Will we need to have a new aerial installed to be able to watch Digital as well as analogue programmes?   Is anyone in a similar situation e.g. Does anyone own a DVD recorder with Digital/Freeview built in? If you could tell me if you needed a new aerial installed to be able to watch Digital, I would be glad to hear from you.      Thank you.

Hi,      I have a 2 year old PC, windows XP, about 1.5 years ago I got as a gift an IPOD Nano (i believe its the nano), 2nd generation, I installed the itunes software and linked the ipod to the pc using the USB, I then purchased songs and they are in my main library, everything was fine, then this week I get another IPOD (someone in the family got the current version of the NANO) and this one needs to be installed on the same PC, its a newer version and comes with the software CD as well, so i assume i need to install this software as well, in order for itunes to recognize this newer version. Problem is i already have an ipod and itunes on the PC. How do I install the 2nd software and have it work with the new IPOD and when I purchase songs for the new IPOD, i want them to go into I guess the new IPOD's library and not in the original IPOD's library. Then when I plug the USB to the PC and to the new IPOD, I want only the new songs I purchased for the new IPOD to update the IPOD ?
