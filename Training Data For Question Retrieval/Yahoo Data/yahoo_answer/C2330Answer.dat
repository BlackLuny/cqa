EnXlS0yVaa	AP History? Be more specific.<br>  <br>  I took AP World at that age, I don't know how you can ask people questions like "is it hard?" Everyone is different, some people here are saying it is a lot of work and they got a 2. I didn't think it was hard, I got a 5. Just take the class.|`|nB5R7HwSaa	I'm in it right now and I'm fifteen, started the class when I was fourteen. I've had a solid A all year it's hard, though. You have to read, write, and memorize a lot. But in addition to learning facts and dates you have to know the importance of what you learn, how it relates to other events, how it relates to current events, etc. Also, don't half *** assignments because you'll regret it on tests and finals when you don't remember that time period because you rushed through it. <br>  <br>  Wish me luck I'm going to start preparing for the AP exam soon! :)|`|eZsOGcOwaa	Ap history is exteremly difficult if your planning to have other advanced classes.<br>  IT very benificial, and i personally like it alot. but you have to be able to manage the homework, tests, and dates well. and be able to organize your time.<br>  Its alot of dedication, but if you can, try it.<br>  I'm sure you'll enjoy it once you can handle it.
Sozc3MyFaa	Neither.  Nursing is not the best path to med school.  Being a Pre-med in college is the best path.  Do not waste an undergrad nursing place (and even more a master's place) from someone who REALLY wants to be a nurse.  You do not learn the same things in nursing school & medical school and you would spend extra years making up the med school pre-reqs to get in--spending more time & money. Nursing skills will not help much in med school, you need an entire new set of skills. Being a nurse first with out even practicing as one will not make med school easier to get in, or even easier overall.  Pick a career--nurse or doc. You can always look into nurse practitioner (or physician assistant) if you do do the nursing route.|`|AA11039109	Both are a waste of time.

You are jeopardizing your job.  If  you fall asleep or doze off, you could be fired.  If while you were up 24 hrs you were partying and drinking, if they suspect they can have you take a drug test and if you are legally drunk you can be fired.  If if you have been drinking, then you better stay home sick as you are.  <br>  <br>  You have a job and you can't do a decent job if you aren't getting sleep.  Kids today are not always easy to teach and it takes an alert teacher to teach and to help a kid if there is trouble, as well as to help yourself.  If  you are uptight or hyper from lack of sleep you could lose control of temper.  You are putting yourself in danger - physically and of losing your job.<br>  <br>  If  you don't like teaching, then go get another job as kids shouldn't have to have a poorly prepared teacher and one who is hung over from lack of sleep.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Volunteer yourself to help out in classrooms like the one you see yourself in. Take the time to seek out the best teachers in the subject areas/grade levels you are interested in. Ask parents in the community who the best teachers are. Look for teachers who are involved in professional organizations or who teach at the university level. Start out by just watching, and gradually increase your activities with the students if the host teacher is comfortable with it. Offer to teach minilessons on areas you have expertise in. <br>  Start a professional journal. This should be a sturdy, hardback notebook, like a laboratory notebook or a composition notebook. As you watch the teachers whose classrooms you are in, write down cool things they do or say. After each session, write your impressions. <br>  Think hard and write hard about the teaching profession. It is not for everyone, and it is a lot easier to realize that BEFORE you spend a lot of time and money studying education. Think about yourself deeply: Do you enjoy being the center of attention? Do you have a strong self-esteem? Are you knowledgeable about many subjects? Are you good at thinking on your feet and improvising in a pinch? Are you warm? Fun to be with? A funny bone in the making? Flexible in everything you ask for? Are you willing to be kids' teacher and not really their friend? <br>  Join a professional organization that specialises on the teaching career. Be sure to get the student discount and subscribe to the journals. You will learn a lot, get ideas and inspiration, and impress people in school and job interviews if you are keeping abreast of the latest in your profession. <br>  Attend state, regional, or national conferences while you are still a student. The rates are deeply discounted, and you will make valuable contacts. You will learn a lot about new teaching methods, and you will be inspired. It also looks great on your resume later. <br>  Find a teacher training program where you feel comfortable. The cohort model is increasingly popular, and it helps you establish solid relationships with other students and future teachers. In this kind of program, you go to classes with the same people term afer term. Make sure that the program helps you through the process of getting your license and finding employment. <br>  See if you can substitute teach or work as an aide part-time while you go through the program. You might also look into tutoring or working at an after-school program. Any education-related experience you can get prior to that first year teaching is critical for your success. <br>  Study your state's requirements for licensure. Try your best to get multiple subject-area endorsements while you are in college. It makes it way easier to find a job. <br>  Try to seek out relationships with the best teachers you can find. See if you can student-teach with them. Student-teaching is one of the most important professional relationships you will ever form, so it is best to work with someone with whom you are very compatible and whose work you admire. <br>  Ensure that somebody in a higher rank observes you at lease once. He could be the principal of the school or a school officer. Make sure that he sees you doing an outstanding job! If you feel like your lesson was less-than-great, invite her back for a second round and show how you have grown. Impress her. She can be an invaluable resource to you during your job hunt. <br>  Save examples of your work and students' work while student teaching. Make sure that student work shows mastery of state standards, not just pretty fluff. <br>  Bring along important stuff stuff with you, while you are being interviewed for a job. Your professional journal, samples of student work, lesson plans, photos, posters, videos, CDROMs, whatever it takes. Have SOMETHING to leave with the interviewing committee: a mini-portfolio they can keep and look over after the brief interview. Realize that most interviews are just about 30 minutes long. They can relax and peruse your stuff later. <br>  Thank the job interviewers. Always send hand-written thank you cards the day after an interview. Ask the secretary on the way out if you don't remember everyone's name.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	English, literature, but these pay less and it is difficult to find a job. Get a double major with a subject that is in demand like math, bilingual ed., science, etc.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	If you want to teach Literature you should major in Secondary English and Literature, or major in Secondary Education with endorsements in English and Literature. Middle school doesn't really focus a lot on Literature alone -- there are a lot of other things you have to focus on and the students aren't really mature enough for some of the really good literary works that you could teach high schoolers.  If you have an old high school english teacher see if you can shadow them for a day or even sign up to substitute teach just to be sure teaching is for you.|`|VZFEB85Iaa	I'd choose kindergarden or 1st grade.

AA11039109	Here's the sequence...<br>  <br>  High school, college, medical school, internship/residency in surgery.<br>  <br>  At each step, the task is to get to the next step.  Yours is to prepare yourself to get in college and to excel while you're there. <br>  <br>  Take the "college prep" sequence in high school, which should include 4 years of math, science, English, at least one year of a foreign language, and whatever else your HS requires.  You don't have to be perfect, just good enough to get in a decent college.<br>  <br>  In college, major in Pre-Med, biology, or maybe chemistry.  You must do extremely well here since getting in medical school is very competitive.
DQlZIzAFaa	The "standards" of American education are ridiculously low. Honestly, given the chance, most pre-teens could probably do simple algebra or pre-algebra, yet my state thinks that pushing algebra onto 8th graders is too harsh and only advanced students should attempt it.

rpRzeGN5aa	I strongly disagree. Yes, some colleges are scams, since the degrees aren't 'worth' much--like the University of Phoenix. But let's say you want to be a Professor, an Anthropologist, a teacher, a Vet, a magazine editor--you will need to go to college, or you simply do not have enough credibility to be hired at a top place. Maybe you could get hired a small local magazine, but you will never be hired by a top-notch magazine like The New Yorker.<br>  Furthermore, statistics show that you make much more money with a college degree than you would without one. In 2007, U.S. Census data showed that people with a bachelor's degree earned NINETY PERCENT more than those with a high school diploma. <br>  Yes, for some people, it might not be worth it, simply because they'll need to take out too many loans. But for the majority of people, college can only help you--it will never hurt you.|`|9Ijv5Mppaa	I don't think any degree is a scam, unless you get it from an unaccredited institution. <br>  <br>  So many people go on the internet and spout their opinion on what is or is not "practical" and "useful" and "worth time." But in reality they're just people who wanted to be painters or writers or anthropologists but didn't have the guts to follow their dreams, because what if they didn't have someone telling them what to be at all stages of life? What if they had to actually create something for a living? What if their paycheck were irregular? The horror. There is a reason that no society is made up exclusively of practical-minded office-drones and blue-collar workers. They are not the people that make life worth living. People who get degrees in the arts or social sciences are. <br>  <br>  So stop trying to put down all the people who decided to go out and pursue their own happiness and fulfill your own life.|`|dfBYe4Vyaa	um.....how is college a scam?<br>  <br>  you need a degree to show you are qualified for a any serious job. <br>  <br>  you dont need a degree to work at mcdonalds but the reason people get degrees is so they can learn and be able to get a better job instead of being stuck at minimal wage

zgTsCicNaa	Here's what white privilege sounds like: <br>  <br>  I am sitting in my University of Texas office, talking to a very bright and very conservative white student about affirmative action in college admissions, which he opposes and I support. <br>  <br>  The student says he wants a level playing field with no unearned advantages for anyone. I ask him whether he thinks that in the United States being white has advantages. Have either of us, I ask, ever benefited from being white in a world run mostly by white people? Yes, he concedes, there is something real and tangible we could call white privilege. <br>  <br>  So, if we live in a world of white privilege--unearned white privilege--how does that affect your notion of a level playing field? I ask. <br>  <br>  He paused for a moment and said, "That really doesn't matter." <br>  <br>  That statement, I suggested to him, reveals the ultimate white privilege: the privilege to acknowledge you have unearned privilege but ignore what it means. <br>  <br>  That exchange led me to rethink the way I talk about race and racism with students. It drove home to me the importance of confronting the dirty secret that we white people carry around with us everyday: In a world of white privilege, some of what we have is unearned. I think much of both the fear and anger that comes up around discussions of affirmative action has its roots in that secret. So these days, my goal is to talk openly and honestly about white supremacy and white privilege. <br>  <br>  White privilege, like any social phenomenon, is complex. In a white supremacist culture, all white people have privilege, whether or not they are overtly racist themselves. There are general patterns, but such privilege plays out differently depending on context and other aspects of one's identity (in my case, being male gives me other kinds of privilege). Rather than try to tell others how white privilege has played out in their lives, I talk about how it has affected me. <br>  <br>  I am as white as white gets in this country. I am of northern European heritage and I was raised in North Dakota, one of the whitest states in the country. I grew up in a virtually all-white world surrounded by racism, both personal and institutional. Because I didn't live near a reservation, I didn't even have exposure to the state's only numerically significant non-white population, American Indians. <br>  <br>  I have struggled to resist that racist training and the ongoing racism of my culture. I like to think I have changed, even though I routinely trip over the lingering effects of that internalized racism and the institutional racism around me. But no matter how much I "fix" myself, one thing never changes--I walk through the world with white privilege. <br>  <br>  What does that mean? Perhaps most importantly, when I seek admission to a university, apply for a job, or hunt for an apartment, I don't look threatening. Almost all of the people evaluating me for those things look like me--they are white. They see in me a reflection of themselves, and in a racist world that is an advantage. I smile. I am white. I am one of them. I am not dangerous. Even when I voice critical opinions, I am cut some slack. After all, I'm white. <br>  <br>  My flaws also are more easily forgiven because I am white. Some complain that affirmative action has meant the university is saddled with mediocre minority professors. I have no doubt there are minority faculty who are mediocre, though I don't know very many. As Henry Louis Gates Jr. once pointed out, if affirmative action policies were in place for the next hundred years, it's possible that at the end of that time the university could have as many mediocre minority professors as it has mediocre white professors. That isn't meant as an insult to anyone, but is a simple observation that white privilege has meant that scores of second-rate white professors have slid through the system because their flaws were overlooked out of solidarity based on race, as well as on gender, class and ideology. <br>  <br>  Some people resist the assertions that the United States is still a bitterly racist society and that the racism has real effects on real people. But white folks have long cut other white folks a break. I know, because I am one of them. <br>  <br>  I am not a genius--as I like to say, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. I have been teaching full-time for six years, and I've published a reasonable amount of scholarship. Some of it is the unexceptional stuff one churns out to get tenure, and some of it, I would argue, actually is worth reading. I work hard, and I like to think that I'm a fairly decent teacher. Every once in awhile, I leave my office at the end of the day feeling like I really accomplished something. When I cash my paycheck, I don't feel guilty. <br>  <br>  But, all that said, I know I did not get where I am by merit alone. I benefited from, among other things, white privilege. That doesn't mean that I don't deserve my job, or that if I weren't white I would never have gotten the job. It means sim
xwQ2my6Maa	Someone somewhere set the standards for whatever it is they think people should know and if they don't know what they know then that makes them not as smart.

For me, this was harmonica. I have since given up on it.<br>  <br>  3. Write stories. I know of a 4-H club that is always looking for skit ideas. It is a good excuse to come up with stories.<br>  <br>  4. Read a good book. "The Silmarilion" was on my list, though I wouldn't recommend that particular book if you aren't much of a reader. Read the Hobbit or the Chronicles of Narnia first.<br>  <br>  5. Start a hobby. For me, it is photography.<br>  <br>  6. Go for a run. Or rollerblade (skate in the winter if you live up north). Or whatever. Just get outside.<br>  <br>  7. Type "things to do when bored" into google. You will find plenty of ideas, some better than others.

xuztRbN7aa	As a second year student just coming back from an internship I can tell you that college doesn't effectively prepare you for work.  <br>  <br>  College is important to give you a broad field of knowledge and theory of such, but all of that are nothing more than a weak foundation.  Experience is always always always the key to getting a good job no matter what (internships, etc).  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying ditch college.  Only a few individuals skipped college and succeed (ex. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc) and the rest of us need a college degree to get ourselves up on our feet to survive what's ahead.|`|vyVDWIehaa	It really doesn't.

It took me until about age 27 or so to learn that maturity.|`|x0rqNORPaa	Pros:  Possibility of specialized knowledge, gives you time to mature, helps you learn to deal with stress, helps you become a better writer and communicator, looks better on a resume, allows you to have the possibility for grad. school and beyond, helps you find out what kind of careers you'd be interested in<br>  <br>  Cons:  Costs money?  But even then, its a wise investment.|`|QebfMqdMaa	It really depends on what degree you're getting, if you ask me. I had a lot of friends who got earned business-related degrees, and their classes were a direct reflection of the workplace: all about doing presentations, accounting, marketing projects, etc.<br>  <br>  For me, as an English major, I'm STILL trying to figure out how my degree prepared me for the workplace. My former professors are still encouraging me to pursue my masters and PhD in English, but I don't want to teach. <br>  <br>  With English, it was all paper-writing and class discussion, which I only see being helpful if I want to actually go into teaching. I guess I learned how to be a better writer and how to form/defend a persuasive argument, which would be helpful if I wanted to branch out into marketing or journalism.<br>  <br>  But if I wanted to do that, I'd would've majored in marketing or journalism.<br>  <br>  I'm not knocking my professors or anything, it's just that some degrees lend themselves more to real-world application (mostly, the sciences and mathematics) than others.<br>  <br>  Right now, my career options pretty much all require me to go to graduate school to earn my masters. I'm glad I majored in English because I'm good at it and I enjoy it, but sometimes I wish God had given me a more practical "talent." <br>  <br>  Like...if He'd made me good at computer science or business, I'd be all set. :)|`|k0MqD82saa	Pros:<br>  - A higher percentage of you getting hired at a job.<br>  - Gives you the skills you need to succeed in the outside world.<br>  - You earn more money if you go to college<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - It cost a lot of money.|`|a292abef1a0f2e960a3aeec079ea9c8baa	Actually it does not but that aside education prepares you to be receptive to learning how to learn.

5m5qApYxaa	It all depends on how many APs your high school offers,  The school will send a academic profile of the curriculum available and the admissions staff will see if you have tried to take the hardest classes or if there appears to be an attempt to cherry pick and take the easier route.  Schools like Tufts, BC, Holy Cross, etc take a very close look at the academic classes taken and not just the overall GPA.  They will often remove non-core classes like gym, band, art and recalculate the academic GPA.|`|x0rqNORPaa	Its not bad.  But some college will only take so many AP credits.  Check the college's websites and look at their equivalency charts to see what classes you'll be getting out of, what score you would need, and if they even offer to accept AP credit if its your major.  If you can't find a chart, e-mail an advisor.
SATTX6egaa	It depends on what grade you are in and what state you're in. Connections Academy is good and so is IQ Academy. Each school had different grades depending on the state and they are each only in a few states.<br>  <br>  EDIT: There is an IQ Academy in Texas that offers middle school and high school. I am currently enrolled in IQ Academy in a different state. Connections Academy also is avalible in Texas but only goes to grade eight so that obviously wouldn't work for you.<br>  <br>  IQ Academy is great. I'm in my first year of it and I love it. There are great course options and the teachers are very nice and helpful. You get a teacher for every subject and you can email them whenever you have a question.  <br>  There are also things called Elluminates. It's basically an online classroom. Teachers have elluminate sessions about once a week for an hour that any students in that class can go to. The teacher uses a microphone and talks to everyone and the students can also use it if the teacher allows them. Students also get a chat box where they can talk to each other using IM. The teacher gives a lecture and shows a power point most of the time. Students can also raise their hand when they have a question. It's really great! <br>  When you log in each day you have a list of your courses and you just click on the course you want to work on and it will tell you what you need to do. You get a pace chart also for each class that tells you what you need to do each week to stay on pace. <br>  The work isn't too diffucult. A few things can get a bit challenging but you'll have that at any school. The courses are really fun one you get into them.<br>  As far as getting into college afterwards, you shouldn't have a problem. IQ Academy is the normal public school curriculum. You'll have the same chance, if not a better chance of getting into the college you want as the students in public school.<br>  Here is the link to the IQ Academy Texas website if you want more info. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iqacademytx.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iqacademytx.com/index.php</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.

A way to keep track of your progress is to record your daily work on gridded paper, one subject per line.  Each month you can transfer the total to a subject credit sheet.  Each 180 clock hours equals one credit hour.|`|QUBMATEpaa	Calvert is a good hoemschool. It is tough sometimes but the results are WAY awesome.

Never had the highs been higher or the lows been lower. The Great Depression—the worst economic crisis in the country's history—left an indelible scar on American society and culture, causing millions of people to languish in joblessness, homelessness, and starvation for nearly a decade. In an American culture that measured self-worth by success, many breadwinners from the Roaring Twenties felt deep humiliation when they found themselves unable even to put food on their families' tables. Even today, nearly every survivor of the Great Depression can still recall the feelings of hunger and desperation.

ctOge9SLaa	Hello sister:)<br>  Satan caused the evil spirits, that is, the fallen angels, to mingle with man and to join with man through illegal marriage. At the time of his fall, before the creation of this present world, Satan captured a large number of angels.  According to Revelation 12:4, it should be that one-third of the angels followed Satan in his rebellion. This is the reason that Ephesians 6:12 speaks of the principalities and powers in the air. The Lord Jesus even told us that Satan has a kingdom (Matt. 12:26). In this universe there is an evil kingdom of the subtle enemy of God, that is, the kingdom of Satan. Satan has a kingdom, meaning that he has under his rule a good number of principalities, dominions, and powers.<br>  <br>  According to the whole revelation of the holy Word, these fallen angels under Satan's control did something which polluted the human race. They caused the human race to be extraordinarily sinful and to be a mixture. No longer was the human race merely the human race; it became a race that was mixed with the fallen angels. <br>  <br>  Perhaps this word sounds very strange to you. Very few Christians know that the human race was once polluted by being mixed with fallen angels, the fallen spirits. Nevertheless, there is such a fact recorded in the Bible.  A number of the fallen angels in Satan's principality came down to the earth, took human bodies, and used these bodies to form illegal marriages with the daughters of men. In this way, the human race was mixed with the fallen spirits.<br>  <br>  When Peter and Jude wrote about the degradation, they wrote with the facts recorded in Genesis as a background. In verse 6, Jude says that the angels did not keep their principality. Principality here means the angels' domain or rule, referring to the sphere of their rule. What is the principality or sphere of the angels? According to Ephesians 2:2 and 6:12, their principality is the air. God's dwelling place is the third heaven, man's dwelling place is the earth, and Satan's and his angels' dwelling place is the air. When Jude 6 says that the angels did not keep their principality, but left their own habitation, it means that they left the air, came down to the earth, and entered into illegal marriages with human beings. God has reserved these fallen angels under darkness in everlasting chains unto the judgment of the great day.<br>  <br>  <br>  When did these angels leave their principality? When did the fallen angels leave the air of their principality and descend to the earth and do something which caused God to reserve them in chains unto the judgment of the great day? They must have done something very serious in order for God to take such an action. When did this happen? It must have been during the time mentioned in Genesis 6.<br>  <br>  This illegal marriage between fallen angels and the human race produced Nephilim. The "mighty men which were of old, men of renown" in 6:4 were a product of the fallen spirits mingled with the human race (cf. Num. 13:33). Although the King James Version uses the word "giants" in Genesis 6:4 and Numbers 13:33, the Hebrew should be rendered "Nephilim." It is translated this way in the American Standard Version. The word Nephilim means "the fallen ones." G. H. Pember in his book Earth's Earliest Ages says that it probably refers to the fallen angels. However, the Nephilim were not purely angels, but were the product of the mixture of the fallen angels with the daughters of men. They were the product of the mingling of the human race, that is, human blood, with angelic spirits.<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, the Nephilim were "men of a great stature" (Num. 13:32). If you were to look at them, they would threaten you, and you would be frightened. That is exactly what happened to ten of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. They saw the Nephilim and were terrified (Num. 13:33). They told the Israelites, "We should not go into the land, for we saw the Nephilim there." The Nephilim which they saw should be again the descendants of the fallen angels that had mingled with the daughters of men. The Nephilim were giants, capable men, men of renown.<br>  <br>  God sent the flood to exterminate Noah's generation because the blood of that generation had become impure. Likewise, God slaughtered all the Canaanites because the Nephilim again were among them, and the blood of that race again was no longer pure. God could not tolerate that situation. For the sake of the fulfillment of His purpose, He could not allow such a human race to exist."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I got this from a life study of the Book of Genesis and it was very helpful.  If you want further information I am leaving this link for you.<br>  Grace be with you sister.<br>  Yours in Christ<br>  sandy<br>  <a href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/life-studies.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ministrybooks.org/life-studie...</a>|`|QjlWEapVaa	Nephilims were a race issue from marriages between fallen angels and daughters on men.  They were the giants in the Bible.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	they are the giants.  The children of women and archangels.  They are in the book of Enoch.|`|grwtwPbAaa	References Nephilim<br>  by Judd H. Burton <br>  Genesis 6:4 states <br>  "The Nephilim were on the earth in those days --and also afterwards-- when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown." The Nephilim were a race of giants that were produced by the sexual union of the sons of God (presumably fallen angels) and the daughters of men. Translated from the Hebrew texts, "Nephilim" means "fallen ones." They were renowned for their strength, prowess, and a great capacity for sinfulness. <br>  The origination of the Nephilim begins with a story of the fallen angels. Shemhazai, an angel of high rank, led a sect of angels in a descent to earth to instruct humans in righteousness. The tutelage went on for a few centuries, but soon the angels pined for the human females. After lusting, the fallen angels instructed the women in magic and conjuring, mated with them, and produced hybrid offspring: the Nephilim. <br>  <br>  The Nephilim were gigantic in stature. Their strength was prodigious and their appetites immense. Upon devouring all of humankind's resources, they began to consume humans themselves. The Nephilim attacked and oppressed humans and were the cause of massive destruction on the earth<br>  www.panthelon.org/articles/n/ nephilim.html<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Below is what I personally believe: and I am not saying this idea is correct,only a theory!!!!!!<br>  Most people believe that demons and fallen angels are the same. They are not!<br>  <br>  Demons: are the offspring’s from fallen angels and the daughters of men. (See Gen: 6) <br>  During this time the human race veers away from God. Rulers develop harems, signaling sexual dissipation, and criminal acts that violate the rights of others are excessive. And “violence” (Gen 6: 11) – acts that intentionally damage others- are rampant. Noah, who is not only righteous but is living blamelessly among his neighbors, is living as a preacher of righteousness. He is busy telling others that a judgment day is coming. Genesis 6:2 states “the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were beautiful…. The sons of god were in fact part of Satan’s fallen angels. (See 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6). These fallen angels had union with the daughters of men, and the result was the birth of giants. The flood occurred and the resulting physical death of these giant offspring happened. However, Moses said the giants were on the earth in Noah’s time, after the flood. <br>  The book of Job (which is the oldest book of the bible) refers to the “sons of god” as angels. So it is believed that the giant’s spirits remained alive without natural bodies. It must be remembered that they are evil, since they are the offspring of fallen angels. Since they lost their bodies they crave to possess one. Jesus refers to those who walk through dry places. These offspring are known as demons. Since they are of the earth they remain on the earth, seeking to destroy whosoever they “can”. They were born of this world, and they remain on this earth and they are not airborne.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ORIGION OF DEMONS<br>  <br>  Since demons are the product of the daughters of men and the fallen angels, they are known now as demons. Once you understand where the demons came from (sexual sin) you know where they like to best operate in. Demons work in the areas of sexual immorality. They are unclean spirits. Their fathers were the fallen angels. God didn’t spare these fallen angels (2 Peter 2:4). He sent these to hell, but not all of the fallen angels sinned with the daughters of men. Of the fallen angels that didn’t commit this particular sin they became Satan’s celestial group, the principalities, etc. Not only do these demons operate in the areas of sexual sin they also love violence, since that was part of their origin. Sexual perversion, lust, and violence go hand in hand since their fathers were of the above. They continuously attack the unredeemed man as well as the redeemed. There is a limited amount of demons, but there number is not known. Remember that Jesus cast them out of a naked man into a herd of pigs and when asked how many were inside this man. The Lord answered “a legion” (which is one thousand). And why were Jewish men herding pigs? As Christians this is an important question because if Satan even has a small foothold of leverage in our lives – he will use it against us to consume us. Since man is of the flesh, sexual sin is one of the hardest to get rid of.<br>  These demons are tireless; they will attack men endlessly until there is no purity left in any. The book of Genesis describe that sexual immorality and violence go hand in hand with these forces of hell. These two activities create many perversions for men and women alike – and that had much to do with why God brought on the flood – to rid the world of this evil. We must guard ourselves against these particular sins as they can completely overtake the soul. People who have these evil spirits in their lives usually display violence and sexual sin.

O7KR3tgjaa	This depends on the school, your GPA, as well as other factors. There's a precise mark that you've got to meet in order to max out on financial aid. Since you are an independent and also unemployed, you might recieve a grant for that. If you are a minority, you may be considered for another grant-- so it solely depends on your personal status.<br>  <br>  Most financial aid packages cover the cost of undergraduate school so you'll get money for the university you were talking about. But if you'd like to attend grad school at a dental institution, you might have to pay for that all on your own.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest a meeting with the school's financial aid representatives to determine what you'll need to pay. No one else will have more information on grants and scholarships than the school itself.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|J6FJdI2yaa	If you have a state scholarship, tuition is 100%.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	No, those degrees will not lead to you teach math at any point.  Most people will stop with an MBA (masters in business) unless they want to teach - but teach business.  The doctorate will allow you to teach at the university level.  That's about 8-12 years of school, on average, for a doctorate.  One in business will be on the shorter end of that (science and math on the longer end).|`|Moz2d806aa	A doctorate in business is usually only for people who want to become professors. If you want to work in the business field, you only really need an MBA. Often, someone who is smart enough to get their Ph.D in business will not waste time on a joke business undergrad degree. For operations management: major in engineering, specifically industrial.<br>  finance: major in mathematics.<br>  It will be about 4 years after undergrad (so 8 years total) to get your doctorate.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	For students and debaters working on this topic, the best place to start is at <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=1917" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article....</a>  It has links to both sides (click on curriculum) and is easy to navigate.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you don't have to sympathize with criminals to take a good look at the death penalty system in action.  If you do, you find surprising and disturbing things. Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money.

Is it humane?  Is it based on race or mental stability?  Will a poor person be more prone to receive the death penalty than a rich person?  Are men more dangerous than women?  Today we will try to answer these questions with statistics and facts along with our beliefs in the value of humanity and the fairness of an eye for an eye or forgiveness and rehabilitation.|`|g73u605Haa	Introduce the topic by giving a brief explanation of how the judicial process for the death penalty works, then talk about what kind of people are accused and put on death row, and then talk about execution and exoneration.  <br>  <br>  Other good talking points: how so many inmates are severely mentally ill and are executed anyway despite it being unlawful to execute someone who is mentally incapacitated.  Also mention how racism is a big factor in indictment, look at the numbers, you will find that the majority of the inmates are people of color, despite people who are not of color killing people too.  And finally, it would be good to talk about the lethal injection process and how many find it to be cruel and unusual punishment as it is questionable whether after the first injection (which is a light anesthetic) if the inmate is truly asleep.  The second shot is often administered without knowing whether the inmate is fully under the anesthetic, and as it paralyzes all the voluntary muscles (something that is incredibly painful) many inmates are still awake and must suffer through this process.  Another thing is that without the death penalty, taxes would be lower, because the state would not need to fund public defenders and investigators to work on the cases of those not capable of affording a private lawyer (the vast majority of inmates) and the inmates would just get life without possibility of parole.|`|7XUZIuEFaa	I find it easy when I start with "imagine."<br>  <br>  Imagine.... you are sitting in an electric chair.

7m8ayTLjaa	Reading is a unique form of learning that allows us to experience facts, stories, history, etc. indirectly, and across time. It opens our minds to abstract concepts and other points of view. It stretches our minds and keeps neural pathways open. It is certainly the cornerstone of formal education in virtually every culture which has such education.<br>  <br>  It has been posited by Jean Piaget, the father of cognitive developmental psychology, that it is formal education which brings us to the final most advanced stage of cognitive development. In cultures without written language, Piaget argues that people remain in a sort of adolescent-like mindset. This is not to say that they are not intelligent, just that they never advance past the Concrete stage to the Formal Operations stage, where they no longer require concrete objects to make rational judgements. <br>  <br>  It could be argued that reading makes our minds capable of hypothetical and deductive reasoning, and these are skills and qualities which we need in order to learn.|`|iPXE4N5kaa	Readers score higher on tests than non-readers.|`|4d8g3q6saa	Don't you see that your quoting SCH. is the best example against <br>  his argument?

7ydnDQl2aa	First, I implore that you don't steal this answer verbatim, but take t the basic facts of it.<br>  Speech writing tips:<br>  You should be able to win over your audience with basic facts and logic, as well as answering the questions that you could predict a non-believer in aliens would ask.  Your speech should already deflect any arguments against it.  Also, it will be hard for an audience to take you seriously without proper grammar and spelling.<br>  <br>  Facts:<br>  If the universe is truly infinite, it is impossible for us to be alone. Although the conditions for life on a planet are very specific, there has to be somewhere other life. In fact, using simple logic, there must be an infinite number of planets with life on them, unless there is a point in the universe where there is nothing but darkness, which could be the case.<br>  Also, it is impossible for two given universes (within a tetraspace) to be exactly parallel, and there must be portals somewhere in our universe (again, an infinite number of these portals because tetraspace is also infinite). So, aliens from other universes - with completely different laws - could be in our universe after coming through these portals. (one theory is that black holes are these portals, but I think that the portal would be a constantly moving, infinitely stretching plane.<br>  Also, if you have the time, I reccomend that you watch the movie "Alien Planet".

EdC9JfIQaa	I actually had a pitbull puppy that I trained.  Pitbulls are obnoxious, arrogant and overbearing-somewhat like a good friend. Another characteristic they share with friendship is that they are tenacious and, once they trust you, will challenge you to be better than they are.  <br>  <br>  The best way to challenge them back is to let them know you are not afraid of them.  The best way to do this is to act like you are eating out of their food bowl with them.  <br>  <br>  The runt of a litter is the runt for a reason.  All the other siblings push to get to the food first and the runt gets the leftovers-if there are any. The order that the siblings eat is the order of their dominance.  Therefore, if you "eat" first, the other siblings will respect you and listen to you.  <br>  <br>  This takes a lot of guts because, with a pitbull, the bite is worse than the bark. Therefore, sticking your face next to it when it is eating could cause it to snap at you. But, if you don't flinch, it will respect you forever.

C4WlEbIOaa	I was rejected by GWU, early decision.  I would rank it GWU, Georgetown, and then AU, personally.  I would suggest you go visit AU, because it is located in an odd location.  I actually withdrew my application from AU once I found out where it was located.  <br>  I would say AU is the easiest to get in from all three, and Georgetown the most difficult. <br>  I would say that you should have lots of money to go to all three schools because they are super expensive.  <br>  For your classes next year, try and take a few AP classes, and do well in them.  <br>  Okay, so here are the Stats for all three schools for you.  <br>  GWU:  GPA: 3.75 (Weighted), SAT: 1900+, SAT II: Not needed for College of Arts and Science, needed for other schools.  DO NOT APPLY ED, I think it does not do well for you unless you have a perfect transcript and are not depending on fin. aid. Need a decent amount of EC's.  Also, if you can get on campus to get it interviewed, do it!<br>  AU: GPA: 3.5 (Unweighted) SAT: 1450+/1600 (It looks like they only look at your Math and CR and not the writing portion) SAT  II: Same as above.  <br>  Georgetown:  GPA: 4.0+ (Weighted)  SAT: 2000+ SAT II:  Same as above.<br>  <br>  If I got into all 3 and had my choice, I would pick GWU because it is located by the white house, congress, and you can pretty much walk to the places you can get jobs and internships at.  Also, I love that GWU does not have a campus, and their dorm rooms are EXCELLENT.  If you get in and go, know that I'm totally jealous.  I'm going to try and transfer.<br>  <br>  Also, you should look into Boston University and New York University, they have GREAT international relation programs.  And, BU is a great place to go to school as well.

The computer thing might be hard, because if you get on it for school work, you might end up wandering onto the internet. Why don't you work out a deal where you cant go on until your homework and studying is finished-- and if you need the computer for homework, give yourself a time limit like an hour or 30 min. to do research or type up your paper, and if you need to lengthen that limit, check-in with your parents and let them know that you're still working-|`|juXQJJrXaa	i think its great that u see what is distracting you from your work.. i would suggest you give the items to your mom, with the agreement that you can only have these items back when you finish your homework, and you mom checks it.. you will be willing to finish your homework properly and quickly so that you will have your things back..  this will also show your parents responsibilty !

28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Its absolutely fine to do it that way. You are still taking a number of AP classes, so it will look great on your College Apps. <br>  <br>  The only time you would even worry about this is if its the specific thing that you wish to pursue...if you want to go to school for Biology, then definitely take the AP Bio class...even then, I don't know that it would make a huge difference.<br>  <br>  Just a side note...AP Bio was my absolute favorite class in HS...it was super fun.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	If you are in all AP classes you should be able to handle AP Bio. The trick to making yourself look good for colleges is to show progression, for example it would look really good if freshman year you were all standard, sophomore year you had some honors, junior year you had mostly honors, and senior year you took all honors and AP courses.|`|LxEAT0XKaa	When you say them "all" do you literally mean you're going to do all AP sciences. I mean I did something similar. Instead of taking AP Spanish next year, I'm taking regular. And instead of AP English Literature, and taking a Syracuse course. Then again, I've got 5 other APs lined up next year. Still, if you don't take it, big deal. I know plenty of people who backed out of a couple of AP courses and still ended up at Ivies. You're good.|`|oLk6IoDeaa	Yeah. in the beginning of the year i was in AP biology and i got out of the class because she was going over all the stuff that would be required and crap and i just wasnt up for it. Its ok.. lol I may not take it at all.. this year i played it safe to just honors even tho 2 ap teachers wanted me to take their class.|`|ofQ1QM1Saa	Are you thinking of going into a biology-related field or medicine? If so, you might want to keep AP bio and not do AP another class, but I'm not an expert, so, yeah. :P|`|2I5XqMDzaa	its better to do a class u can handle it will look better on a transcript|`|6PBGAp7Raa	Yea, that's fine. Colleges would way rather see an "A" in a regular or honors course then a "C" in an AP class. and you can always study extra on your own and sign up for the AP exam to try to get the same credit for college. You don't need to take the actual course to take an exam. Also, if you take it and it winds up being too heavy a work load, it could negatively affect your other grades which would be worse. So if you think it would be too much then just take the regular course instead. good luck!|`|e1zvb2ADaa	AP classes are for the students who have done exceptionally in that class the year before. They are for the students who find regular classes too easy and want a challenge. if biology is already hard enough then take the regular. an A in a normal class is defiantly better than an F in AP.|`|FarXPqq9aa	Sure it's okay, just make sure that a college knows that you were offered it!<br>  <br>  Also, to make up for it do some charity work during the summer, colleges will eat that up and you will have a higher chance of getting in.|`|Q0zVaBuaaa	Well for reference,in a lot of colleges an AP class is weighted 1.5 of a gpa higher than regular college prep classes. Hopefully this helps, but you have to answer this question yourself.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	i think its ok as long as ur not planning to go into bio, cuz if u do at a really good uni, itll be better to take ap bio.¨<br>  <br>  but hey, do u know what u wanna do, cuz u dnt need to be taking so many classes..|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	if youre already taking ap classes and thats the only one youre having trouble with it should be fine. the only tine it really would matter is if youre going to major in science when you get into college|`|KrFQ1gcraa	Biology is hard.<br>  I think you'd be just fine not taking AP.

l57Ld9xaaa	Thesis statement = <br>  <br>  1. Specific Noun (i.e. Meyer Wolfsheim)<br>  2. Active Verb (i.e. represents) Note: avoid using "is"<br>  3. Assertive Predicate (i.e. the seductiveness of clever corruption)<br>  <br>  Reasoning:<br>  Meyer Wolfsheim rigged the World Series, but is seen in a very sympathetic light throughtout the book by Nick and Gatsby. Moreover, he's one of the only people to attend the funeral. We forgive his corruption because he's clever, but in doing so, we also start to forgive Gatsby himself, who is guilty of similar crimes. <br>  <br>  Remember that symbolism doesn't need to be complicated. Virtually any detail in the story has significance, you'll just need to make an inference about what it is. For example, during the party scene, one of the guests mentions to Nick that the pages were never cut in Gatsby's books (in earlier times, the buyer manually cut the pages apart after buying the book). This indicates that while Gatsby owns a lot of books--enough to fill a respectable library--he hasn't read most of them. The guest remarks that Gatsby "knew when to quit." What might this mean? One guess is that Gatsby's fraud (and ones like it) were normal in upper-class circles (i.e. buying books for a personal library to "appear" intellectual), but that Gatsby left the pages together to reduce the pretentiousness of the act. Yes, he *owns* the books like other upper-class types, but he doesn't *pretend* to have read them. :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  <br>  A12|`|M7QjpS6Taa	F.

A D and/or F is not acceptable to them, and they don't accept many transfers, as was already said.|`|vyVDWIehaa	Ivy League schools don't accept many transfer students.  Particularly Columbia.  They are small.  <br>  <br>  Unless you don't like it at Hofstra or aren't challenged or learning anything, I'd stay there.  You're doing well and GPA means more than what school you go to.  Say you transferred to Northwestern.  Everybody there was at the top of their high school class.  It could easily be five times harder than Hofstra and you could struggle.  But getting a 4.0 at Hofstra could open a lot of doors and you already know it's possible.  Just a suggestion...

Set your clothes out, have a shower the night before.<br>  Then in the morning you just need to get up, have breakfast, brush teeth, brush hair and get dressed.
IWSc7xkiaa	Honestly, I think either way will be greatly appreciated. Teachers love to hear from students who actually got something from all the effort they were putting in teaching. You may think about sending a card. You wouldn't have to say much in it, but at least then your teacher could have a little memento to keep for years.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	either.
sx8MsmPSaa	Unfortunately, where you go will depend largely on where you get in. I know at 13 it seems like you can get in anywhere, but MIT is highly selective. As you get older, your SAT scores will be a good guide on where to apply. They're generally a good indicator (along with your GPA) of where you will be accepted.|`|fZkFgYDmaa	I really don't know dude, im 13 also and right now im thinking of high school.

t4xtqjjfaa	Well volunteering is good but so many people do it that even having an insane amount of hours starts to blend in with everyone else. You say you are a painter and a writer, have you entered your work in any competitions or shows? Awards and state or national recognition are the type of things that set applicants apart at very competitive school. Have you also considered applying for Yale's summer program? It's a great thing to put on any college app if you are accepted and attend. And if you are interested in politics JSA is a lot of fun, and if you are elected to a regional leadership position it is something that would look impressive on a college app.<br>  link to yale summer program if you don't already know about it: <a href="http://www.yale.edu/summer/application/welcome.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yale.edu/summer/application/w...</a>|`|C4WlEbIOaa	Before I say anything else, Yale rejects people who rank number 1 in their class on a normally.  It's REALLY hard to get into Yale. Your GPA right now is a 4.0/5.0 which is a B.  <br>  I'll answer it to the best of my knowledge.<br>  I hate to say it, but Yale is not going to accept you unless you have over a 4.2, (5.2) in your case; perfect SAT Scores, LOTS of EC's, and lots of AP/Honors classes. Their acceptance rate is only 9%. A close friend of mine applied to Yale this year-- early action. Her GPA was a 4.2, her SAT score was 2190/2400, on her three subject tests she score a perfect on the Spanish, she got a 750/800 on her Lit subject test, and she had 700/800 on her History. She was super involved with clubs, had a bunch of AP classes, and she did not get accepted. Early Action's rate is like 23% accepted and she still did not get in. So, that says how difficult it is.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped a little.  AP's look good, but it does not matter if you don't pass the tests. The colleges-- especially Yale-- think that you could not handle it. And, for Yale, you need to get 4 and 5's.|`|lMNRzbO3aa	what do you want to major in at Yale?|`|DJYJqYleaa	It is awesome that you are thinking ahead to college as a freshman. But, I advise you not to get so set on one college. There are many wonderful colleges other than Yale and no one has good chances of getting in. You should visit lots of schools in your junior year to get a sense of a number of places you would like to attend. As far as what you can start doing now... really, really focus on your grades. If you can't get straight As or A+s, so what? Maybe Yale isn't for you, (I'm sorry and I'm sure it isn't what you want to hear, but it is the truth). To get into top schools like Yale you need to take all of the most difficult courses at your school and do well in them all. But, if you aren't doing well in the upper level courses, you might want to lower your standards. Take part in extra curricular activities and volunteer. Get involved in any way that you can. Take time this summer to start prepping early for the SATs. You will need killer scores to get into a Yale level school, and doing well on the PSATs is not necessary, but would be very helpful because if you can be a national merit scholar that will certainly help. As for JSA, it is a very good program but there are lots of very good programs. If you are interested in politics, go for it, but if not, there are many programs you could do... or your could work, volunteer, intern or take part in something else. Honestly, there is no one thing that you can do to set yourself apart. As you know, there are TONS of qualified kids who want this just as badly as you. All you can do is work hard. If you are passionate about something, get involved with it. You say you love art. Join art clubs. Maybe do an art program this summer. Take advanced art courses. Demonstrate your passion as well as you can. Maybe teach an art course. <br>  <br>  If you work hard and you really want to do well you WILL get into a GREAT school and one that "fits" you, but you have to realize that that school might not be Yale. You might not get in. You might fall in love with another school. Have you even visited Yale? I suggest you stop looking at specific schools for at least another year or so. Leave that to junior year, maybe end of sophomore year. Right now, do the best you can. You won't know what kinds of schools you should look at until further along in your high school career. You need to see your standarized test scores, your grades, your transcript, all of that. Oh, and one more bit of advice, make sure your teachers like you. In a few years you will be needing recommendations from 11th and 12th grade teachers as I'm sure you know, so develop a good reputation. Be a nice person so your teachers and school will realize.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck! Try your hardest but still have fun. I'm sure you will fall in love with and be accepted to an awesome school, (maybe Yale, maybe not). Oh and by the way, don't stress too much over freshman year (although of course work hard) as it doesn't matter AS much as the rest of your high school years.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped some!<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, <br>  <br>  Sorry. I forgot to add that I'm going to start a nonprofit charity organization for orphans. hehe.<br>  <br>  ^^^ do this because you want to, not for the application<br>  <br>  and as the above answer said, art competitions would be a GREAT idea.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You need a 4-year college degree to apply to medical school - they only care about your college classes, not high school.  Med schools recommend you take your premed classes at the highest level school you attend, so that means not using AP credits to place out of bio or chem or physics or math, if that's what you mean.  So yes, you and everyone else would need to take them again in college.  But that's good - doing well on the AP exam means you'll probably ace college-level science (hopefully) and that will help keep your GPA high.

But the food that these people ate isn't still going to be there after thousands of years, because food rots quickly. <br>  <br>  So we are stuck looking at rocks that were made into tools, and other things that could survive for this long. If someone gets lucky, they might find seeds that never sprouted, and that could be evidence that the people were farmers.<br>  <br>  By the way, you might have more luck with this question in the Anthropology section - click Social Science, then Anthropology.

8nTu6a4Paa	Well, the SAT is now out of 2400.  And the Princeton Review says that most colleges regard scores below a 1100 as low and the national average is about 1500.  So, according to the average, 1300 is a little below, but not absolutely horrible.  Never fear, you can always try again!  There's good books on preparing for the SAT as well.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you do better on verbal sections than you do with math, I'd suggest taking the ACT as that focuses more on verbal skills and has 4 areas of testing instead of just two.  I took both, and my ACT score was comparatively a lot higher than my SAT score, because I do better on verbal tests than mathematical ones.  <br>  <br>  Study up, and try it next year, or during your junior year.  Good luck!|`|9DCjdnZ1aa	well i guess if it's your first time.<br>  you can study and do better :D|`|CgOs2ViPaa	well its not a good score, that's true. however, if you haven't taken geometry and algebra 2 yet, that might be the reason why your score is low, seeing as the math portion covers those subjects. so yeah, its not a big deal. i mean, you're only a freshman so you've got 2 more years to improve your score|`|OUxxGO6paa	For a freshman that is good :)

5x29ikk5aa	That's a fairly good score. I got a 24 on my ACT, and colleges seem not to mind.  For cheaper colleges, they require an 18 usually, and others require a 20.  with a score of 24, most colleges will be interested and won't turn you away, unless you're applying to an upper class school. Then scores around 27-over 30 are required. You can always retake it anytime for a better score, and study guides you can buy to help you study may be a great investment.|`|Dh0JX2Onaa	You are doing better than average but it is not an outstanding score./|`|ISljRZIRaa	yeahhh|`|8nTu6a4Paa	well, the highest you can get on the ACT is a 36.

tTg1XU8faa	The pond is a circle. The distance from the edge to the center is 8 feet long, so the radius of the circle is 8. You are looking for the distance around the pond, which is the circumference of the circle. The formula for the circumference is 2pi(r), where r is the radius, so the distance around the pond is:<br>  <br>  2pi(r)<br>  2pi(8)<br>  16pi<br>  about 50.2654825 feet <===<br>  <br>  *To the answerer above: Reread the problem. It does not say that the rope goes to the center. It says the rope only goes around the pond.|`|c1yTH7QXaa	the measurement you're looking for is called the circumference. it can be found with the equation 2(pi)r, where r is the radius of the circle. the radius is equal to half the diameter, which is the longest length between two points of a circle. pick any point on a circle, and draw a line from that point, pass through the circle's center, and connect to another point on the circle. thats the diameter, and the radius is half that. in the website's problem, it says that the rope goes from the center to the edge of the pond so that's the radius, which they said was 8 feet. multiply that by 2(pi) and you get 16(pi) feet. use 3.14 as pi and you have 16 times 3.14 = 50.24 feet.<br>  <br>  50.24 feet is the circumference. however, the rope started at the center and traveled 8 feet before getting to the edge, so you have to add 8 feet.<br>  <br>  the length of the rope is then 58.24 feet.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You can transfer whenever you want, but whether or not you're successful will depend on what your grades are - and what your high school grades were.  College applications are dun in Jan/Feb, so you'll be apply to colleges without having any college grades to show them - just your high school grades.  If those were enough to get into college, good.  If they weren't, you'll have to wait until you have college grades for at least a year to show them you're ready to attend a 4-year college.  That's why most people spend 2 years in community college.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Most four year colleges only need 12 credit hours from your CC to transfer.

Hopefully you picked some backups you like - and if not, there's always the option to try and transfer later.|`|7ab916140739d43fdaf1975e036f6b98aa	Contact the admissions department.  I believe there is an appeal process.|`|ZJKcczPWaa	Don't appeal.

I have so many friends who are in college (ivy leagues, state schools, UCs, even community college) and NONE of them have given me a bad review. overall being in college is awesome because there is so much more to college than which school you go to (no matter what peers, parents and admissions officers say). and even though its really corny, I truly believe that the college experience is what you make it. So try not to be too bitter. You will be happy where ever you go.|`|ct8ebOk3aa	Can't be the essay or test scores. How did you not get accepted with a ACT:30 to UIC?

So, we're in a state where we're sacrificing the creative intelligence of the next generation for the short sighted goal of Standardized Testing.

t8kykME3aa	What an interesting question :)<br>  <br>  In order to unleash as much as possible the potential of your brain you have to start by defining what you want to improve. Intelligence is not a clearly defined term but you need to define what it means for you.<br>  <br>  For example we can say intelligence is the ability to make connections between facts in such a way that you will be able to draw the correct conclusion (deduce relative truth) in a situation. Based on this conclusion you need to be able to decide what is the best course of action and then to pick the best methods to achieve what you want.<br>  <br>  Based on this definition you see that your intelligence depends on input (facts) and on ability to analyze and correlate facts.<br>  In order to know facts you have to study. You have to study long term to improve the collection of the facts you know. You also have to study short term to understand new problems you are faced with. When I say study I don't mean just reading books but also doing practical things. For example you cannot study playing tennis just from books. In order to fully understand tennis you need to practice it.<br>  <br>  One very important aspect is to study how to study. It is very important to know what to learn and how to learn. You can read about this but in the end you have to understand through trial and error what works for you. Different people learn using various combinations of theoretical and practical activities.<br>  <br>  To be able to learn you need to search for learning techniques and memory improvement exercises and techniques. To improve memory basically you have to improve the ability to make connections.<br>  <br>  Once you know how to learn and what to learn and you are on the right track. Intelligence is also the ability to extrapolate and draw conclusions about the big picture from limited input. To develop this ability you have to constantly try to use learning for this purpose. For example while learning history try to understand the connection between different events, the causality and the reason behind the events. The same for example with geography. Look at the effects of relief on weather. Try to understand why things are the way they are. Build scenarios and try to validate them.<br>  <br>  Now after looking at the world this way you should be able to extract the important facts in a given situation and to draw correct decisions. But still this is not enough. In order to be very precise in your thinking and then in acting upon your thinking you have to keep your mind clear. In order to have full control on your mind you have to train this control. Relaxation techniques, meditation techniques and specific physical training can help you achieve that. Think about meditation, yoga tai chi and others.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that a healthy mind lives in a healthy body. Sports and good eating habits and in general a balanced life will help you to fully reveal the potential of your mind.<br>  <br>  This process is life long and it doesn't have an end. You can always become smarter and more experienced. It is a life long journey.<br>  <br>  Every learning process starts with learning one method of doing one thing. This is the first level of learning. At some moment you find out about more methods of doing the same thing and you become interested in comparing them. This is the second level of learning. While you continue using these methods you reach the point where you create new methods until the method doesn't matter anymore. You've reached the point where the skills used in solving the problem are as natural as basic instincts. They are your own values. This is the third level of learning. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that usually people at different levels of learning cannot properly communicate with each other because the language changes. At first level people think solution, at the second they think method but at the third they just naturally act.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your quest :)|`|4e061QWkaa	Eating fish is a great way to improve memory because of its Omega 3's.

However I will never accept who I am right now.  I am striving to improve myself in every way.  So to accept ones self completely means that we have no areas to improve upon.  I think accepting that fact is truly terrible.|`|fLjPs8pCaa	Jung, Carl Gustav (k?rl goos't?f yoong) [key], 1875–1961, Swiss psychiatrist, founder of analytical psychology.<br>  <br>  He also developed the theory of synchronicity, the coincidence of causally unrelated events having identical or similar meaning. <br>  <br>  For Jung the most important and lifelong task imposed upon any person is fulfillment through the process of individuation, the achievement of harmony of conscious and unconscious, which makes a person one and whole.<br>  <br>  In response to Statira, yes, hmm. A large part of me thinks we have everything we need except for motion, getting off our rockers is imperative to arriving some where. See below: second star to the right...<br>  <br>  We should check out Thomas Szasz. He validates current psychiatry by checking and balancing it. <br>  Thomas Stephen Szasz (pronounced /sas/; born April 15, 1920 in Budapest, Hungary) is a psychiatrist and academic. <br>  He is a prominent figure in the antipsychiatry movement, a well-known social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry, and of the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as of scientism. He is well known for his books, The Myth of Mental Illness (1960) and The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement <br>  he criticized the "Free World" as well as the Communist states for its use of psychiatry and "drogophobia". He believes that suicide, the practice of medicine, use and sale of drugs and sexual relations should be private, contractual, and outside of state jurisdiction.<br>  In 1973, the American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year.<br>  <br>  Personally, I try to live by (and the mental tape-script keeps running through my mind) the quotation from Peter Pan: "Second star to the right, straight on till morning." Captain James T. Kirk is quoted using the second star line. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Star_to_the_Right" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_...</a>

UcTUdPrwaa	Its arguably the best in the nation (normally ranked in the top five).  Not just that but many biotech company's are here in SD, so placing an internship or job is easier.  Also many of these local companies were started by UCSD grads.  <br>  As to companies determining whether it is a good school, industry usually informs the campuses what they want in an a candidate.  Good schools adapt there curriculum to meet industry needs.  UCSD does this all the time.  It can be annoying since this means a course can be added to your graduating requirements.   Anyhow best of luck.
qV8Vz36Iaa	Were you president of student council?<br>  Football team leader?<br>  President of the debate society?<br>  Have extensive work and interest in the bioengineering field?<br>  Have won student awards or prizes?<br>  <br>  How have you distinguished yourself from those who earn a 3.3 who did not get into the program?<br>  <br>  Now if you were a member of the Bush family who donates a building, I'm sure you'd be in the program within a few seconds.|`|aCDWwsisaa	If you got a 3.15, and they require a 3.4 to 3.9, then you did not get in because your record proves that either you are not smart enough to meet their expectations or you don't work as hard as they expect...<br>  <br>  You can "appeal" all you want, that won't make them want you.<br>  <br>  And if you really want to go into science, you might want to work on your spelling...accuracy is critical in scientific disciplines. "Univerisity" and "rejeceted" are not real words, and spellchecker doubtless told you that when you were typing the question, but you chose to ignore that...would you be happy with a bank that was that inattentive to your balance?|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	It's very simple, they rejected you because you didn't get their required results.|`|298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	Appealing generally is not an option when you've been rejected from a college or university. They have certain standards and, if you don't reach them, you don't get accepted, end of story. It doesn't matter if it's been your dream school since you were five years old or if you haven't applied or been accepted anywhere else.<br>  <br>  Generally, schools respond to applicants with one of three decisions: accepted, rejected or wait-listed. If you've been rejected, it doesn't matter how much bigger their program gets, you won't suddenly be accepted. When spaces open up at universities (generally when an accepted student chooses another school or the program is expanded) they begin accepting students from the wait-list group. So, unless you've been wait-listed at the school, you're not getting in.<br>  <br>  Like others have said, you can start out at another school and, if your grades there are good enough, apply as a transfer student to your first choice.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	No appeals.<br>  <br>  However, if you go to the best school which accepts you and get straight A's, you can apply as a transfer student.|`|KcAehrrKaa	They usually don't do things like that, but there have been exceptions like Einstein.|`|mb2Otvunaa	It isn't a debate or court case...<br>  If you didn't get in, they don't want you.|`|C4WlEbIOaa	You can e-mail the admissions office and ask for to appeal the decision.  Personally, I would not waste my time doing that because 99.99% of the times they will not accept you. (I appealed when I got rejected to GWU and they rejected me again haha)  You have a better chance of transferring and getting in. But, you should still try, it will only help.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11261740	NO.  Why appeal.  They have standards which you did not make.<br>  But, if you do appeal, then do it. You probably know the process...but still.....once you get in  (I hope you don't onoly for the sake of standards) then..hey...the next kid who says..OH gee..I didnt get accepted to the bio engineering dept....becasue my gpa was 2.9...damn..I'm going to appeal..<br>  <br>  it is any wonder American Universities rank #17 in the world?|`|VkVyuq5baa	I'm sorry that his has made you feel down. I'm afraid not, because you didn't meet the asking criteria. However, you did have a chance and I am glad you took the risk. If you don't risk anything you will never gain anything - you have to be "in it to win it". Hope you win next time :)|`|IWSc7xkiaa	No, I don't think that there is much you can do here. If you were a little closer to a 3.4 you might have a fighting chance, but a 3.15 just isn't that close. Some schools have very high prerequisites and don't allow any wiggle room. I would just look elsewhere.|`|Rsr8nngWaa	Looks like you don't have much for grounds to appeal on if you're that far out of the GPA range. Write a letter, don't hope for much.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	Chances are that you weren't a right fit for the college to begin with so you'd probably be happier somewhere else.  Plus companies look at where you get your masters more than where you get bachelors.|`|ahujYDBdaa	Get back up, and try, try again!|`|SCeIOtZpaa	You don't have a GPA in their range of accepted students, but if you actually think you have a shot at an appeal you can call the admissions office and ask them about their appeals process.  <br>  <br>  Usually you have to have a pretty good reason as to why you are appealing too...so if you go through with an appeal make sure you have reasons why, especially since your 3.15 is lower than their 3.4-3.9|`|sx8MsmPSaa	No. You're below their standards. It's not as if they had no reason for not accepting you (the general concept of an appeal). Your GPA was too low. End of story. Sorry, but all you can do is bring your GPA up and try to transfer next year.|`|L39kEDoqaa	It is possible to appeal, but you would make a fool of yourself! Your GPA is way too low, so why do you think you deserve to go there?|`|Z5qoTctNaa	You can always contact a counselor at the school but if you plan on attending the fall semester, it may already be too late as they most likely have their rosters full.|`|t4DP30r6aa	No you can't appeal.|`|Q7d1Fo1daa	I would use a Molotov Cocktail to appeal.

But you do need a comma after 'a chicken or a pig'.<br>  I like the comma after 'We have killed', but expect someone to disagree. Here, it adds that subtle pause and is, in my opinion, valid.<br>  The only other point I'd raise is that the phrase 'of those who you yourself' should read 'of those whom you yourself'.<br>  Good luck.

Why lie?|`|5mIhU9KAaa	I'm debating on going into that major myself. let me tell you first off if you don't already know a thing or too about the study it's a hard subject to grasp. i'm in my first semester of financial accounting and it's a different world with a lot of stuff to know. but getting it down is the hard part. once you understand it. it becomes second nature from what i understand. and yes usually accounting majors do quite well after they get there degree. only thing is most people can't handle doing it there entire life because it's so boring. <br>  <br>  good luck.

r5wUPsz8aa	There are quite a few online vendors that will buy your textbooks from you, but if they're older editions then you might have a hard time selling them.  You could do some internet searching for any company with a buyback program to find some vendors that purchase textbooks.  Generally requesting a quote does not obligate you to send back your textbooks, so you can see who will pay you the most for them.  Here's a few to get you started:|`|9q578shgaa	Try posting your books on <a href="http://www.bigwords.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigwords.com</a> That is where I sell all of my books back at the end of the semester and I've noticed that I get a lot more money back if I use them instead of some other sites.|`|AA10297549	<a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-9500130874042580%3Alhydcc-51gy&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=sell+old+textbook&sa=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub...</a>

Moz2d806aa	You should probably major in history. However, you could major in something more useful for the workforce, and learn it on the side. History, obviously is a subject that could just as easily be learned by reading books and self taught as taking actual classes. Go to a library or a bookstore, and you can find a book on any facet of history you are interested in.|`|zv01EjTLaa	Move to the US.  Live long enough.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Read. A lot.<br>  <br>  Go to University and take a degree course, then a doctorate.<br>  <br>  Done.<br>  <br>  Simple eh?
TaZvxS7Saa	You say this class is a requirement, which means you'll have to take it sooner or later. Sooner rather than later is better, however horrible that sounds. I say stick to the class and get it over with.|`|6TxREZWdaa	yes hey look at committments|`|qZ23brcwaa	No. The point of droppin the class is so that it doesn't hurt you. Thats why if you're failing or not doing good you just withdraw from the class and thats it. You can drop a class within the first two weeks i think and you can get a refund, but once you're like halfway thru the semester and you drop the class you still have to pay for it and also the book(s) turn out to be a waste of money. But yeah, if you feel you're not going to do so well in the class, you should drop it. You don't want a low grade. Your gpa will suffer.<br>  <br>  I learned the hard way :(|`|258c8918b8008933d8507500eed704dcaa	as long as you drop before the "last day to drop..." with or without a "W". you're fine.  it won't affect your GPA...  and schools won't look at it badly because they know it may not all be because of the course.  It may be family related, personally related, or any other personal reason.<br>  <br>  good luck

6a425ca0206ca2d39f255ee40c811f44aa	Bachelors degree 4 years<br>  Medical school 4 years<br>  Residency 4-5 years<br>  <br>  No radiology school.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	probably something close to that, although after you become a doctor, you would work in residence  <br>  at a hospital specializing in radiology...probably 2-4 more years to become certified as a radiologist.|`|C4WlEbIOaa	You won't exactly go to "College."  You will be going to tech school for radiology.  So, option C.<br>  And, its a lot of MONEY!!|`|dOJQsStSaa	Radiology school?

A9oWnxYlaa	College, unless you think you lack discipline and need structure. If that's the case then go ahead. But would you want to die in the marines at 20? ;(|`|iPvLRE6Oaa	Defiantly finish out college. And if I were you, just skip over the marines entirely. You're only 20, almost done with college. Our country is fighting for ridiculous reasons. Dont think you'd be dying for saving the country.|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	I don't think you owe your country your life.  Especially for what their fighting for.  Stay in college!|`|bnA0wUPRaa	Stay in college. Become a officer in the Marines.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Um why would you die? in college? I am not sure what your life goals are but if I were to start over again I would have gone to college first then join the military. If you are seriously thinking about joining the Marines then I would look into what it takes to join as an officer. A lot of colleges have a ROTC course where after school students join the military as an officer which I think would be much better than what most do is join after high school as enlisted.
VtRbZiy1aa	its to show your progress and your contribution to school. Its practically saying that if you don't work for it, you don't get the mark.<br>  <br>  so basically, its to show your progress in school work.|`|AA11277812	Dude the point of the midterm is to get you use to college, that's what they do in college some classes are not about homework, you take a midterm and a final, the point is to see if you have learned anything at that point, and if not you can drop the class.|`|fPavekfeaa	The point of any test is to gauge how well you are learning/have learned the material.

hmOXtGTwaa	Sentence is fine, but be sure to place a comma before the clause "graduating in May 2007."<br>  <br>  Or how about:<br>  <br>  "I graduated with a BA in (your major) from (name of institute, and city if it is not a well known school) in May 2007."|`|EOZsYlZkaa	Well, if you have to use "graduate" you at least have to add a comma after the (institute, city), graduating...<br>  <br>  Or, "I graduated  with a B.A. from (institute, city) in May 2007". <br>  <br>  Or, " I graduated from (institute, city) in May, 2007, having obtained a (my) B.A. degree".|`|KxYc28aaaa	that sort of makes sense<br>  or u could write " I obtained my B.A. from (name of institute, city ) when I graduated in May 2007."<br>  that makes more sense
Dh0JX2Onaa	You are far better off for health reasons not to drink or smoke./|`|d3hcJVphaa	i was a little nervous when i started but when u get into it its basically like middle skool jst a few extra perks and that smoking drinking deal<br>  if its social and responsible drink occasionally but dont start smoking youll regret it and not many ppl like to be around that smell|`|c5c157de44722b3201c46ab6e2a00078aa	NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!! that is NOT what high school is about. you fail if you do this only to gain some sorta stupid rep. what you need to do is gain confidence and stay away from bad influences if you do any of that you will SO regret it in your future because it will come back and haunt you. it's not cool, it's super nasty and people that do that are trying to be mature but to the mature people they look outrageously immature. and they are. don't join them, don't give in to that kinda stuff. go make friends the classic way and just talk! you're 14, young, and your life is just beginning. don't throw it away as if it's worthless! it's not scary. just be yourself and be a buddy!|`|waVPtmAEaa	it'll all be fine, you have the same fears as everyone in your situation, and yes it'll be bad for you to drink and smoke. Its not cool , be yourself dont try to impress anyone.|`|rwrDD14Jaa	Yes it's bad to drink and smoke at your age. It's illegal and extremely unhealthy.|`|cIs6GcYvaa	Dont do things if you know there will be terrible consequences and High school isn't scary at all. Dont drink or smoke pleez dont thats terrible . play sports!!|`|eMQudlg4aa	well you're not fat if your bmi is healthy. if you really think you're fat, try dance classes or sports or just exercise. <br>  <br>  Is it bad to drink and smoke? What do you think? Why else would it be illegal? There is no drinking responsibly underage. If you drink illegally, that's most definitely not responsible. And smoking can ruin your lungs. You might say you will only smoke sometimes, but it's very addictive and you won't be able to quit.|`|Dw17gInsaa	Look it's your life if you no one else want to drink and smoke then do it but don't do it to impress others that just really sad, oh and ignore people making fun of you for your weight it is probably just puppy fat i had loads of it when i was your age i am nearlly 16 and i am a size 8 in england so don't panick it is all good
AA11604732	There are two main problems.  The first is that it would mean higher taxes.  The second is that money rarely comes free -- and if the government is giving money to universities, they may attach strings, lessening academic freedom|`|ZEc4GoGfaa	that its socialist; and we cant live like commies or we'll start speaking russian or cuban or whatever....<br>  <br>  it would be hectic.<br>  <br>  but aside from the joking, the level of education would come down, or either be REALLLY expensive.
AA11146651	Ok, the question wants you to make the production costs equal the money from sales.  So, set up your equation with the production costs on one side and the money from sales on the other, like this:<br>  <br>  $41,785 + ($9.50 x Books) = $24.75 x Books<br>  <br>  Then solve it, like this:<br>  41, 785 + 9.5B = 24.75B<br>  41,785 = 15.25B<br>  2,740 = B<br>  <br>  If you plug 2,740 back into your equation you can prove that the production costs equal the money from sales.
AA11604732	Almost 30% of Northwestern's students are Black, Asian, Native American or Hispanic.  Another 5% are international.  So I wouldn't call it a White School, since the percent of white people in the school is the same or less than that in the general population.<br>  <br>  In addition, people who are snobby will rarely wear purple.  I know that I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  That being said, your comparison to USC is apt.  USC is 23% Asian, 12% Hispanic, over 5% African-American and nearly 10% international.<br>  <br>  You need to get your facts right before you cast aspersions on these schools.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	No it's one of the best schools in America,a top 10 school actually and it's better than Duke. They aren't snobby, it's kn Chicago so it's pretty diverse.
C4WlEbIOaa	If I got into Cornell, I would go there because your pay check will be bigger, since it's an ivy league school. <br>  However, yes, NYU's location has an advantage.  You might have to travel going to Cornell, but at the end of the undergrad, it will be better if you go to cornell.|`|nLFXkiExaa	Cornell's overall ranking is higher than NYU's.<br>  <br>  But for many business programs, NYU tops almost all schools, including Cornell.

Colleges do care what happens your last semester of your senior year. But other than that, your grades sound awesome and you should get into a lot of schools.|`|ombfkcfNaa	No darling, it won't have a drastic effect on your GPA. I'll give you an example that will hopefully put your mind at ease; I graduated with a 3.5 GPA even though during my senior year I recieved D on Physics and a C+ in Pre- Calculus. It dropped from 3.57 to a clean 3.5. So, I wouldn't worry about that D+ ;P. Now your GPA is a pretty incredible achievement! Keep going and you'll be a successful person one day; more so than now.

d4b561ee302dc2175e53d2d42fcba40baa	Well the most important thing will be your transcript. The people in admissions will look at which courses you took in HS and how well you did in them. So generally, you want to take the most rigorous courseload (honors and AP classes) and try to get all As. To be competitive for NYU, you'd want at least a 3.5 GPA.<br>  <br>  Sports are always good, and getting involved in other school activities also looks good. Make sure you also do some community service though. Volunteering at the hospital or something like that will always help.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you're a little young to start prepping for this but SATs are really important. For NYU you want at least a 1900+. Don't worry about that now. Sophomore year, you can start practicing for that.<br>  <br>  You're on the right track. It's a little early though. Just don't slack off in high school and just have fun!

Dh0JX2Onaa	Information about Berkeley graduate admissions requirements is below./<br>  <br>  I agree with the person who said that admissions are more difficult during bad economic times and I agree with you as well. In bad times more people gp to school in order to better prepare themselves for jobs and also because they are out of work. In good times more people can afford to pay high tuition rates.|`|VCc77ZCoaa	actually, because of the bad admissions, more people are going back to school because job opportunities are so bad.  So it is actually more competitive.
77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	It is not that hard to transfer into UCLA from a CA JC if you have good numbers.  <br>  You kinda give us an idea of your grades but what are the hard numbers?  What is your cumulative GPA?  If taking honors courses is going to leave you in the "B" range, I would rethink that decision.  You really want a good GPA for that school.  A 3.0 GPA is not likely to get you admitted to UCLA.<br>  Being a single mother and working.. may help you some, but you are going to need a solid GPA to go along with that to make you competitive for UCLA. Aim for higher than a 3.5 and I think you will be fine coming from a JC.  A 3.5 straight out of high school would never ever get into UCLA|`|AA10025466	UC transfer admission focuses on grades and demonstrated interest in your field of study. As long as you have good grades and you are working a job or participating in clubs/community service/internship in your chosen field with some decent experience you can discuss in your personal statement, you will be fine.

UxooffHZaa	My degree is in Music Education, and I teach music. If you absolutely want to teach in a school, go for the Education major. But, if it's not absolutely what you want to do, go for the Therapy major. You have to really want to be in a school to be a teacher. That is why the teaching profession has one of the highest drop-out rates of any job. Schools are either right for your personality or not. Principals, parents, etc. I love teaching, but I've seen too many of my colleagues quit or fail at their jobs to tell anyone who's considering this job, and weighing it against another, to do anything but pick the other option. Besides, Music Therapy has so many options, schools, institutes, hospitals, and the Health care professions are all growing.

st3qnhETaa	the penis growth rate starting from the age of 10 to 24 years and over. The size of the penis changes during puberty. On average the growth of a healthy male penis start growing between the ages of 13 years up until 24 years of age. Some boys will start puberty later then some, but this mainly due to genetic factors.<br>  <br>  <br>  During puberty the testicles will first begin to enlarge and the growth of hair will appear around the pubic area. At some stage the length of the penis growth will appear then followed by girth slightly later.<br>  <br>  For a mature adult, the average size for a non-erect penis is between 3-4 inches. When a mature adult penis is fully erected it can reach up to an average of 5.5-6.5 inches .. Teenage boys will have to wait a further one to two years after they have stopped growing in height before they will be able to clearly know their final penis size.<br>  <br>  it was concluded that after puberty ages the average male penis will continue to grow slightly and will completely stop growing around 29-30 years of age.|`|AawCo4oLaa	i'm sure its 6 inches. any man who says they're inches bigger are probably lying *cough* *cough* the man who answered your question :)|`|b952dc4daef7cdac170e8b48c85a490daa	I've heard anywhere from 4 inches to 6 on different studies.....<br>  <br>  But I think one of the studies threw out 4 inches for self esteem help|`|raxnazWKaa	I DONT HAVE A PENIS.<br>  SORRY.|`|J4xsLrnoaa	my size|`|skgN9TJLaa	I believe the average size is between 5-6 inch.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Men seldom see other men in the erect condition unless they are gay, so believe a woman who married late and divorced early.<br>  The average erect male organ is a little shorter than an unsharpened pencil and a little fatter than a wooden broomstick.

81bQDmEtaa	I think you should go for the triple science-I did double for GCSE, and got my results back-a B/B for doing absolutely NO work! Double science isn't really valued that much, and triple science would be invaluable to you in the long run, as long as you put in the effort to get back the results, I'm sure you would succeed! :)<br>  Also, doing triple science would prepare you better for A levels-I took Biology and Chemistry at A level, and really struggled with Chemistry, and ended up having to drop the subject despite putting a lot of work into it, and am still attempting Biology! Universities like Oxford are really looking for an AAA grade at A level, so anything you can do to produce great results would be essential.|`|7twWHSJYaa	do triple|`|ROPLbLW9aa	if medicine at Oxford is what you want to do then triple science should be easy for ya. good luck and get used to the work pile|`|IvqSPjm5aa	If you want to study medicine, you should REALLY do triple. If you want to do it at oxford, you pretty much MUST do triple. I think, anyway. Although A-levels will be much more important for University, you'll still want to show that you've studied science thoroughly. Adding up to 5 doesn't seem right, though - check that. Also, it will really be a lot of hard work - I'm currently doing triple and our teachers are, for some reason, really rushing the coursework!!!!|`|LLrT8iNKaa	Completely. I'm taking triple science because I know it will help me study medicine at Cambridge (my university of choice).

As for clubs and sports, Payton and Whitney are both great at that. If I was accepted into both of these, I'd totally choose Payton, besides, whichever one you choose, they'll both put you on a great path in life.<br>  & also, think about what kind of ranking you'd get in your class; remember, colleges look at your ranking for the admission process.<br>  Payton accepts a small amount of students (Between 240-300; the total amount of students there is between 850-900) and Whitney Young accepts a large amount of students compared to Payton, and the total amount of students there is about 2,000.<br>  So just take all that in and decide, and hey, I might even see ya at Payton =)|`|fFQZABndaa	I'd go with Payton, but that's just my personal opinion.

M1YjvFGIaa	Before people thought that left-handed people were evil so they made them learn to write with their right hand. So it is possible to learn. Start with small things like brushing your teeth and them try harder stuff. In fact using your non-dominate hand can actually excercise your mind. This is because you are using the other side of your brain (no joke). People who do things with thier right hand seem to be more logical, they use their left brain. In contrast, if you use your left hand you tend to be more creative and use your right brain.  I have a friend who is left naded and she is very creative. Whereas me, am rght handed and am very logical.|`|DE5akU6xaa	You are born with a dominant hand and it stays that way.  There is nothing you can do.<br>  <br>  You CAN try to give your left hand some exercises, such as writing.  It will be very hard though, and you will probably never reach the same level of skill as you have with your right hand.<br>  <br>  Train your left hand, but there are no guarantees.|`|PNLKqdQ8aa	Yes, you're born with one hand being dominant and that's the way it is. With enough practice, you'll be able to write with your left hand, but yes, not as well as with your right. You can try sketching/tracing precise lines for practice, or writing your name and other things over and over.|`|auNkztd5aa	When I was in college, I had a roommate who was captain of the fencing team. He used his left hand to hold the foil, and also to write and brush his teeth, but he was born right handed and still threw a ball with his right hand. When he was nine years old, he ran into a closed class door, broke it, and severed the his right index finger just below the third joint. Doctors were able to reattach the finger, but it has no strength and he can't bend that joint. <br>  <br>  Because the index finger is both your power and your precision finger, he had to relearn to do everything with his left hand. He learned well; not only was he captain of the fencing team, but won a couple of national titles too.<br>  <br>  Based on that experience, it seems that it should be possible, with the right discipline, to learn to do all the precision things with your left hand. Start using it exclusively. I'm not sure you will ever be able to throw as hard or as accurately with that arm, but you should eventually be able to train yourself to do the rest. Good luck
FJuBhLOBaa	You may be ambidextrous.  That's a pretty hand trait to have.  <br>  <br>  I'd practice your letters, capital and lowercase, for 10 minutes a day.  Write all the letters out, say twice, then do simple words and sentences.  Alternate hands when you write during the day as you get better.  Do that until your handwriting with either hand is about the same in neatness.  After that, you're set!<br>  <br>  Also, if you can, see how many other things you can do with both hands.  It's useful to be able to do a large number of things with both hands, not only in ordinary life but also if you happen to break an arm, you have the other already trained to do everything.
EOZsYlZkaa	Unless you live in Hawaii or Alaska, $20,000 for 3 people is just above the poverty line according the 2009 federal guidelines Both Hawaii and Alaska are about $1,500 higher). The actual figure is $18,310. Quite frankly, if your family is only $1,690 above the poverty line, there are only two things to do; either earn more money, or reduce your yearly income by about $1,690.

I2Tw4zOAaa	Tile has a high specific heat, meaning that it takes more energy for it to get hotter.  During the summer it takes a large amount of energy to keep it warm so the tiles are nice and cool in the summer.

8LyR0efpaa	Your situation has many facets.  First, you have thought the matter out logically, and your explanation of what happened is reasoned, well written, and thoughtful.  You admit to wrongdoing, you agree that some punishment is proper, and you are willing to accept what is fair.  (I miss in your discussion any regret about having made the bad choice, or any promise to reform, but those are other issues.)  As an administrator, I can tell you that it is a bad decision to put pressure on administrators.  They do not react well to it.  A petition from "The Geek Squad" or any of the rest of them will have no influence whatsoever, because their opinion about the severity of what you did makes no difference.  It is the opinion of the principal which counts.  I would recommend your putting your considerable communication skills to better use.  Write a letter to the principal (send it certified, which costs a couple of bucks, but makes it look important and gives you a receipt) explaining your error.  Focus on regret and commitment never to repeat the transgression.  MENTION (but do NOT dwell on) the difference between the punishment you are receiving and that of the other students.  Let your parents read and edit the letter before you send it, since they may have to be aware of its contents.  Your letter explaining why you feel that "computer misuse" is a more accurate description of your behavior than "tampering" is more worthwhile a use of your time than gathering signatures which will influence nobody.

ncqfq0b3aa	If I were you, I would stay away from Full Sail University. It is a for-profit school, meaning they are in it for the money, not the education. If I was the head of a entertainment studio, and had to choose between someone who graduated from USC Film School or someone who graduated from Full Sail University, I would choose the USC graduate. That is because USC is more reputable than Full Sail, and I can trust the USC graduate to do a more thorough job.<br>  <br>  Now, there are a few that have come from Full Sail and made good, but that is only a small percentage. However, most graduates of Full Sail (like most that graduates from for-profit schools) will either be turned down by employers or will be hired as cheap labor.<br>  <br>  The scheduling is crazy. They claim they are a 24/7 school, which could lead a student to burnout. I even called at midnight and someone answered the phone. I will admit their website is real eye popping candy. But a good looking website does not make a good school.<br>  <br>  On top of that, it is not regionally accredited by a governing body of the US Department of Education, so that makes it questionable. It's national accreditation is not recognized by regionally accredited schools.<br>  <br>  However, you do not have to take my word that Full Sail is a ripoff. Go to the website below and listen to someone that actually went there. <br>  <br>  Now, you want to major in graphic design. There are many traditional schools that provide that. SCAD ia a traditional school so you are off to a good start. Parsons School of Design has associate degrees in graphic design (as well as bachelors in photography).

1zfKVG5Xaa	colleges.mywebcommunity.org - try this site.

You apply by talking to the ROTC recruiter in your area for the branch you are interested in.  Go through the application and all that nonsense, and if you get selected, great you are in.<br>  <br>  Else, you can still participate in ROTC on campus and if they like you (and you don't drop the program) they will get you signed on for a full scholarship by your sophomore year.  Depending on the branch, this may be easier or harder than you would expect. <br>  <br>  If you don't get the scholarship, then they are not paying for anything for you.  You show up for PT/drill and work with them until they put you on scholarship (or you get tired of it and quit).  <br>  <br>  Thoughts on the various ROTC branches:<br>  <br>  Air Force - notoriously difficult to get into.  If you develop any medical or academic problems they will drop you from the program so fast, it's not even funny (even SENIORS!!).  <br>  <br>  Army - easier to get into.

7PbJWEo1aa	a one year foundation course before uni is a half way house between a-levels and degree to make sure you have the basic understanding before doing the full degree course.<br>  <br>  It is just to make sure you have the "grounding" of the course that may be lacking otherwise.<br>  <br>  (for example if you do english, geography and history at a-level but then decide you want to study maths at uni you would have to do a foundation degree year)<br>  <br>  It is quite common on engineering courses, science, maths and other technical courses.<br>  <br>  Usually a foundation course converts into the start of a full degree after a year so (for example) to get a BSc in Material Engineering you would have to do 4 years - a course that would normally take 3.<br>  <br>  Think carefully before you begin a foundation course because 1st year uni is very basic stuff anyway and the course only kicks in on the 2nd year of the course.|`|0l98mcf3aa	As far as I'm aware, a foundation course is at Level 0 (zero), so can't count towards your degree. The course is there to ascertain if you're suitable for the degree course you're considering. If you are, then you start the course (Levels 1, 2 and 3; equating to the years of study).<br>  The foundation course is often used in respect of people who have been out of education for a number of years and need to be gently eased in to higher education.<br>  I'm not aware that it's called a foundation 'degree'. And if you pass the foundation course, there's no top-up; you must fully study for the degree afterwards.<br>  If you can get onto the degree course straightaway, do that.|`|a026d4b14e3c0dc3fbbe97a76351c0f3aa	a Foundation Degree FdA is a 2 year award at HE level, so is equivalent to 2 years of a degree program.  Usually the Uni also offers a 'top-up' programme which is usually a year long and will give you a BA [Hons] Degree. An FdA is usually valued at 240 credits [not related to UCAS Tariff].  A Diploma of Higher Education [DipHE] holds the same value.<br>  <br>  A BA/BSc [Hons] Degree is generally a three year award at HE level [sometimes 4 with a placement year].  This is valued at 360 credits.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.
ktOqm7cgaa	FACTS ABOUT POET DONALD JUSTICE:<br>  Donald Rodney Justice was born in Miami, Florida, in 1925.  His mother encouraged Justice's interest in the arts early in his life, providing him with piano lessons; and Justice remained passionate about music and art throughout his life. <br>  <br>  In Miami, Justice studied with composer Carl Ruggles and poet George Marion O'Donnell.  He was a graduate of the University of Miami (B.A., 1945), the University of North Carolina (M.A., 1947), and the University of Iowa in Iowa City (Ph.D., 1954).  He taught English and writing at several American universities.  From 1982 until his retirement in 1992, he was a professor of English at the University of Florida, Gainesville. <br>  <br>  His books include: <br>  "New and Selected Poems" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1995); <br>  "A Donald Justice Reader" (1991); <br>  "The Sunset Maker" (1987), a collection of poems, stories and a memoir; <br>  *"Selected Poems" (1979), for which he won the Pulitzer Prize;<br>  "Departures" (1973); <br>  "Night Light" (1967); and <br>  *"The Summer Anniversaries" (1959), which received the Academy's Lamont Poetry Selection. <br>  <br>  He also translated Eugène Guillevic's "L'Homme qui se ferme" (1973) from the French.   Additionally, having considered becoming a composer when he was a young man, Justice retained a lifelong interest in music.  He wrote the libretto for "The Death of Lincoln" (1988), a musical work by A. Thomas Taylor.<br>  <br>  He won the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1991 and has received grants in poetry from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. He served as a Chancellor of The Academy of American Poets from 1997 to 2003. <br>  <br>  He lived with his wife, Jean Ross, in Iowa City, until his death on August 6, 2004.<br>  From <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/39" rel="nofollow">http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/39</a> and <br>  <a href="http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/donald_justice/biography" rel="nofollow">http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/don...</a><br>  <br>  "INCIDENT IN A ROSE GARDEN":<br>  The poem consists of 10 stanzas each of 5 lines.  It tells the story of a gardener who encounters Death.  He thinks that Death has come for him.  He runs to his master (a sign of deference) and tells him what he has seen; that he wants to see his sons once more before he dies; and that he is quitting.  The master does not object.  The master then sees Death in the rose garden and tells him that he is unwelcome. Death responds indirectly but with clear meaning as Death says, "As for your gardener, / I did not threaten him. / Old men mistake my gestures. / I only meant to ask him / To show me to his master. / I take it you are he?"<br>  <br>  Of course, each reader finds his/her own "meaning" in a work of poetry.  For me, one "meaning" is that Death may come when least expected, and that we should live life with that thought in mind.<br>  <br>  Another "meaning" that I took from the work is the display of the arrogance of human beings. I believe that it is shown in the relationship between the master and Death.  The master, believing that Death has come for the gardener, refuses to recognize Death's power, telling Death that he is not welcome in his rose garden. He seems to assume that because he is the owner of the rose garden, he can issue orders to Death. <br>  <br>  I hope that these few paragraphs are useful to you.  Good luck!

kov7p4Y8aa	I don't know the movie, but the quote itself doesn't seem to be saying "spies" as in the FBI lol.<br>  So what I think is that those who learn or understand others are not meant to judge them by your own morals, but to step into their shoes, and see it from their perspective. Which is the only way to fully understand a person. Thus thrusting yourself into the "wars" of that inner person, their emotions and feelings, predicament, thoughts, and morals all battling against one another. <br>  Understanding people well involves putting yourself into that battle.<br>  Otherwise, you are not taking everything that is them into account.|`|XhirXRkpaa	I think it means that spies don't consider the morality of situations.  They only do what they have to do.  However, many other people who do consider the morality of their actions, engage in personal wars trying to decide what they should do.

oNV1yja3aa	hmm... to answer #1 yes but depending on what school you go to and the area is what you will have your jrotc ... like virginia beach has mostly navy in the area so they only have navy jrotc... but in another part of virginia there are airforce, army and marine jrotcs<br>  #2 the only thing that it changes is the pay grades... if you go in right after school (HS) .. in the njrotc is supposed to get you 3 pay grades higher in every brach except for the marines... its only 2 pay grades higher<br>  #3... advantages.. alot more people are willing to give you a job if you mention you are in it and realize that it takes alot to be a cadet... but you have to be willing to work hard and to listen to others... oh and to put up with alot of drama.. believe me i know... i've been in it for 4 years now... <br>  but as long as you do what you need to its an easy A for the school course as naval science and takes care of the consecutive thing for your exploraritories. <br>  have any more questions about it feel free to ask

rlKZ40fZaa	Hi, yes it is a comma splice, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  A comma splice is a sentence in which two independent clauses are joined by a comma.<br>  <br>  In your sentence the first independent clause is, 'Many religious people can’t fathom lack of belief in God.' <br>  <br>  The second independent clauses is, 'therefore they assume that atheists reject established religion but not a higher power.'<br>  <br>  <br>  You need a semi colon, a colon, or a comma and a coordinating conjunction to join these two main clauses.<br>  <br>  'therefore' is a conjunctive adverb which is a type of transitional word/expression which links two ideas together.<br>  <br>  Using this word, here are the two best ways to punctuate this sentence:<br>  <br>  Many religious people can’t fathom lack of belief in God; therefore, they assume that atheists reject established religion but not a higher power.<br>  <br>  Many religious people can’t fathom lack of belief in God. Therefore, they assume that atheists reject established religion but not a higher power.<br>  <br>  Additionally, you should place the definite article 'the' before lack.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you need further help improving this sentence, you can email me.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Change the can't to can not, if this is a formal paper it is not a good idea to use a contraction.<br>  <br>  You could add a semicolon instead of the comma and then put a comma after the word therefore.

45deb346668a7b66aee588c0399444f9aa	They are used in a variety of ways in maths and chemistry, but let me explain the context you are talking about.<br>  <br>  Newspapers quote what people say from interviews, but they don't publish entire interviews (there isn't space and people wouldn't read it). So if they just take a sentence quote out of context it might not make sense. The words in square brackets are things that the person did not actually say but are put in by the editor to clarify what they are talking about or sometimes so that their quotes make grammatical sense to the reader. For example:<br>  <br>  "They [the teachers] have no right to complain about their pay!"<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  "[The] teachers who are complaining should all be sacked!"|`|8RCOlWdMaa	Square brackets are used in exactly the same way as round brackets. Sometimes you may need to use brackets within brackets, especially in mathematical formulae, and the use of square and rounded brackets differentiates the pairs. Otherwise, it is just a case of personal preference.<br>  <br>  The use you quote in the Guardian would appear to indicate a word inserted for the sake of clarity where it is omitted in the original  version.|`|QFrbFp4Gaa	You use square brackets when you're quoting something directly but you change one of the words so that it makes sense in the context.  So for instance if the original quote said, "He walked across the street", and you want to make it clear who "He" refers to, you could write "[The boy] walked across the street".  I'm not sure if that's the use of square brackets that you're talking about but if it's not then I don't think I can help you.

3OoCiOkAaa	Quote : <br>  As he put it, "This 'Wait' has almost always meant 'Never.'" He asserted that not only was civil disobedience justified in the face of unjust laws, but that "one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws."<br>  <br>  Psychologists would agree that the wait and see attitude is pretty ineffective. When someone adopts this attitude they are stating they are ineffectual in change and others  instigate change.<br>  <br>  <br>  Waiting is actually a passive  verb- which means the person is active in inactivity. Therefore King had a point of taking part in  civil protests. Otherwise he would have been agreeing to do nothing.<br>  <br>  <br>  I suppose the  clergy who he wrote to : should have been more active  if they wanted change.

NtYXtlUxaa	It's easy!! All you've got to do is... is... umm.... Wow! my Cat's just jumped off the fridge-freezer!<br>  Anyway, what's the question again?|`|pLacTaMPaa	I've had the same thing too, for years in the mornings at school - I used to be sat in assemblies and zone out, the teachers on the stage demanding of the pupils' attention would begin to have auras around them and I would find it difficult to snap out of without lapsing again within a few moments - probably mainly because the hall was not ideal aoustics for a voice to carry across without a resonant echo.<br>  <br>  Fresh air is highly recommended - avoiding sugary & caffeinated drinks as well as foods with high saturated fat content that all cause highs and lows as the body is taken on an induced metabolic rhythm it must revert back from.<br>  <br>    First of all getting into the swing of things - instead of trying to focus and do homework - try doing something as a warm up, e.g. if the homework is the new stuff, how much of the old stuff can you readily lay claim to in well recited detail - if you know this, the homework should be a breeze, just a light coating of extra subject matter [like, it's all relative]<br>  <br>   And clearing out the cobwebs too - anything from a good & loud singing yawning stretching limber up, to a more composed recital, rendition or repetition of any exercises or subjects you enjoy - adversely watching tv makes your body sedentary and your heart rate lower with less inclination to put anything into gear and drive it purposefully.   <br>   Have you tried, walking, jogging, running to the newsagent/convenience store in a morning for a paper or fresh milk/eggs/loaf.<br>  Going out for a walk before teatime, letting tea settle just fifteen minutes & then tipping your books out like a tin of Quality Street so you can pick your favourites and spend ten minutes making your mind up...<br>  Making a project that neatly ties up more than one of your subjects - recently tv ads illustrate exercise equipment used as a dynamo for powering household electricals - that's like phys'ed & science combined....<br>  <br>  Are you listening to music or trying to do the homework with a tv on nearby (even only within earshot, similarly a radio, voices talking etc. - all diversions your brain can misguidedly latch onto) ...<br>  <br>    What kind of hobby...., needing only a little spare time each day, gets you outside in fresh air, never 'needs' doing - like having a corner of the garden to keep or making something in the shed or garage...<br>    If outdoors is inconvenient - something like a craft you can take up and get results soon - providing you are easily focussed on it, so you bring a greater ability to stay focussed on other subjects.<br>   <br>    Your strong subjects are eventually going to shine through while those you have little care for, or do not excel in with an aptitude comparable to those best in class, will cease to matter to the extent they are dropped from your choice of options (assuming you still go through the options process).<br>  <br>    If you find difficulty with focus, yet the subjects are to your liking - it may be that you are tired, or feel pressure to perform to a required grade - you may seek some kind of release - like the warm up exercises mentioned - but only ever need to do it once to be able to continue without feeling your focus is impaired - a burden you carry may be the cause of this, perhaps not even your own - just that as you consider others and mindfully practise the correct etiquette and elocution of polite words, you could be undertaking stress, and maybe unnecessarily so.....    Keep a diary if you do not already, see what is emerging as a theme to your thoughts as you write them down and amass weeks & months worth of thoughts corresponding to your life, others' impact upon it & the events taking place - you could be narrating a pertinent news story that affects everyone in the world and not really speak it out loud - this kind of onus you have placed upon yourself would surely be a millstone to someone still at school finding they are in fact just losing out to a lapse in concentration for every attempt at making the grade....<br>  <br>    Try not be emotionless, but do give vent to any inner impedance between you and your aims.  Also address this where it is an external matter if you must complete these subjects and tasks and something/someone is obstructing you - simply with a poilte and knowing insight stating your need to progress beyond the loss of focus - this could be requiring a quiet space & time for your study and if there's any distraction from anyone else, they will not inevitably take the blame for you failing even if it's them insisting on watching cbeebies while you try complete your homework....<br>  <br>    Just understand it simply and the answer will be too :)
PLmfwr7Yaa	The meaning of assonance is:<br>  Assonance is repetition of vowel sounds to create internal rhyming within phrases or sentences, and together with alliteration and consonance serves as one of the building blocks of verse. For example, in the phrase "Do you like blue?", the "oo" (ou/ue) sound is repeated within the sentence and is assonant.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is YES, it is an example becuase of `ly` being spoken twice in the same phrase (`steadiLY and slowLY)

nB21gG19aa	If you go to a European university, where the education is free for all students, you will find that their mentality is far different from ours.  You could say that they are much more laid back.  As a result, it is not uncommon for students there to take much longer in acquiring their degrees.<br>  <br>  An education, much like everything else, is a scarce resource.  If we made college degrees available to everyone a few things would immediately happen:<br>  <br>  1 - The utility of a basic degree (Bachelor's) would immediately become useless.  After all, everyone has one now.  We would just be shifting the entry level degree required for many employers from a bachelor's to a masters or PhD.  <br>  <br>  2 - Taxes would have to increase, dramatically (not likely to happen here in the States).<br>  <br>  3 - More people would attend school, but do so only because they could, not necessarily because it was in their best interest or what they really wanted to do.<br>  <br>  4 - There would still be the HAVES and HAVE-NOTS in that if you were not accepted into a top rate program you would have virtually no chance of getting into certain positions.<br>  <br>  Pros of the current situation:<br>  <br>  1 - Reduced applicant pool.  <br>  2 - Students have an incentive to actually go to class and get a degree as fast as possible (to avoid financial charges).<br>  <br>  Cons of the current situation:<br>  <br>  1 - It is difficult for some groups to afford the high cost of some universities (although this is arguable because you can afford to go to your local state universities regardless of who you are, through loans and scholarships).|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Sorry.. I think all Education should be free...<br>  <br>  Most people that want it NOT free are people with money, that want it to remain exclusive...So they can continue to be the "Haves" and the Rest will be "Have-nots"...<br>  <br>  Rich people in the 1800s refused to allow free highschool, because it kept the poor from working, and gave them grandiose ideas that they could become "equal..."|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	The answerer above is wrong, there are less than a handful of "developed democracies" which offer free education beyond secondary education, in fact I am struggling to think of a single country that does offer free college (or university, as it is called in most countries) education.<br>  <br>  A very compelling argument is basic the economic principle of supply and demand. If education was free, then more people would go to school and get a bachelor's degree, then go onto get a post-graduate degree, thus increasing the supply of educated individuals. This then decreases the demand and results in lower wages and salaries and you know should be able to work out the rest from that.<br>  <br>  Another argument is where will the funding come from, tax payers? That creates a bigger burden. If there are not enough funds, then the schools will have poorer facilities, fewer professors etc etc<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, you picked the right side of this argument.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I do not know where this misconception that universities are free in European countries comes from. It is simply not true. <br>  <br>  Secondly, how does it take them much longer to acquire their degrees? In the U.K. students finish high-school at 16, college at 18 and then have their bachelor's degrees at 21. Americans, generally speaking, are taking four-five years on average to obtain there degree, that makes the age 22-23 before the average American has obtained a Bachelor's.<br>  <br>  People really should do there research.<br>  <br>  Edit, Someday:<br>  The Netherlands does pay its citizen to study in higher-education, it loans them the money which they then must pay back over time. Not really free education now is it.|`|jBhFaZW8aa	If you chose that side of the debate, I think you chose the wrong - and harder - one.  Public education in many other developed democracies is free all the way through college because going to college should not be something meant exclusively for the people who can afford it.  If you can't afford college, but you don't qualify for full scholarships/grants, you're either stuck with entering the military to pay for your college education or taking out a bunch of loans - at worst, you will be stuck not going to college at all and working a full-time job in food or retail to get by.<br>  <br>  Allowing students to attend public universities/colleges for free would require much higher taxes, yes.  But this "rugged individualism" that Americans tend to foster is getting really old.<br>  <br>  To get the other side of the debate, I recommend looking at European countries with free college education and seeing if you can find any flaws with them or abuses of the system.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To CPG, I have done my research.  I know that the Netherlands offer a free college education, though I'm not sure about the exact terms and conditions that you will need to qualify for it.  One of my good friends is a Dutch citizen, and if she lived in the Netherlands for a year, she would be able to have the government pay for her education.  I suggest you do your research. Have a good day, sir.<br>  <br>  And in my opinion, everyone has the right to higher education.  It shouldn't simply be a privilege for those who can afford it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I also know that Sweden provides free education for both citizens and non-citizens.

JgFkpDwzaa	I took the SATs in 8th grade too through Johns Hopkins CTY. I scored a 1570 (530 math, 530 reading, 510 writing) with no prep before the test as well. <br>  First of all, getting chosen to take the test by a talent search company is an accomplishment within itself, and one score does not define your intellegence. <br>  For no preperation, your scores are good. I'm assuming you are in Algebra 1 for math. Therefore, you are missing many Geometry and Algebra 2 concepts needed to suceed on the SAT. That might  be another reason why your writing score was low. In my state, we get 45 minutes to write an essay. You must be used to this also. The SAT only gives you 25 minutes, which is probably why your score is low.<br>  Since I knew this when 9th grade came around, and since I had some new geometry knowledge, my scores improved enourmously. (I did not study at all, and it was a practice SAT I took, not the real thing.) On my total score, I gained about 260 points. So just getting older and starting to make more sence out of the material will improve your scores. <br>  Anyways, congrats on just getting chosen to take the test and your good scores. By the time you get to be in 11th grade (keep in mind, you are taking the test 3 years before you are supossed to), you will be able to do great. <br>  Hope I could help!|`|47dc19901ab5d71a382bc20054d2c20faa	It's a decent score for someone as young as you are, having received no preparation. I think that after two to three more years of education and some SAT prep-work you'll be good. If you were in 11th grade and scored a 1540, I'd have to call you dumb... no offense.

AA11604732	In the US, law school is a graduate program -- meaning you have to get a BA or a BS first.<br>  <br>  You can go to law school with any undergraduate major.  I would suggest Economics over Sociology (which many think of as a "soft" major) or Legal Studies.  There is no "Pre-Law" major.  "Pre-Law" is just what people say when they want to go to law school.  Sociology is easier -- but the easier major will not help you get into a great law school.<br>  <br>  Human Geography is probably related to sociology -- but not to law or economics.<br>  <br>  In order to get into Berkeley's law program, you will need to go to a high quality undergraduate school (e.g., a CSU wouldn't help you -- but a UC would be great), get a very high GPA as an undergraduate and get a high LSAT score.

Vertical angles are equal to each other. <br>  <br>  Vertical angles are when you have two intersecting lines, the angles which are a reflection of each other, like a V and an upside down V. So in the image, angle 1 is equal to angle 3.<br>  <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/vertical-angles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/verti...</a><br>  <br>  2. Corresponding angles are equal to each other. <br>  <br>  Corresponding angles only occur with parallel lines intersected by a transversal. A Corresponding angle is an angle that's in the same place on each parallel line. In your picture, 4 and 12 are corresponding angles, as are 7 and 15. <br>  <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/parallel-lines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/paral...</a><br>  <br>  3. Supplementary Angles add up to 180 degrees.<br>  <br>  Supplementary angles occur when you have one line intersecting another. The two angles that are next to each other added together equal 180 degrees, because when added together, they are the same as a straight line. In your image, 15 and 16 are supplementary. If they are added together, they equal 180, so if you know 15, you can subtract it from 180 to figure out 16.<br>  <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/supplementary-angles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/suppl...</a>|`|OB0WHwkQaa	m<12=100<br>  m<1=68<br>  m<4=112<br>  m<3=68<br>  m<7=68<br>  M<16=100<br>  <br>  you might wanna check the answers cuz i could be wrong but i think these are right.

The term comes from the Latin post scriptum, an expression meaning "after writing."<br>  <br>  A postscript may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book.

vYNOotEMaa	For one thing, so you can write a sensible question, or one where the verb agrees with the noun.  (Why is there school, or why are there schools -- this is proper grammar)<br>  <br>  Actually, schools are relatively new in history.  Public schools did not start until about the early 1800's in USA.<br>  Before that, all schools were private, mostly church supported.<br>  <br>  The original idea for schools was to teach young people to read, so they could read their Bible.  Many schools used to be taught in Latin, they were called Latin Grammar Schools, because most "classics" were still published and read in Latin, the language of scholars.<br>  <br>  Schools became a "leveling agent" in society.  Giving poor children some boost, or advantage, to become more equal to upper classes who had private tutors, or who could afford to attend private centers of learning.<br>  <br>  You should take advantage of all the free education you can, because later, after high school, you again must start to pay for it.  You will be paying taxes for other people's education, rest of your life.<br>  <br>  So, if you don't take advantage of what you can learn now, you will suffer in more ways than ignorance, you will stiffle your future, reducing your chance to earn more money, and provide for your own family.<br>  <br>  We can increase the earning power, and the potential for each citizen with more education, that's why we pay so much for a good educaion.  <br>  Hope you see the need to enjoy it, while you have the time and energy.<br>  <br>  Only in school, will people be helping you to succeed, later it will be more dog eat dog, and competition, where only the best survive.<br>  It's your choice to learn, or not. I hope you get prepared. <br>  Good luck.|`|7MoYemOdaa	In theory: School is supposed to make people smart so that there would be no idiots. Well theory isn't always right (see: evolution). <br>  Plus by looking at salaries, the best jobs are currently the ones which don't need education because it's that kind of job noone wants to do. So they pay a lot. "Oh no I can't do that, I have a phd" <br>  <br>  So I think government has too much money. That is why there are schools. People want to think that they do something so government gives us this illusion we want.<br>  How else can you explain so many stupid people around?|`|j5v3bTKsaa	Not funny if it is not original..

AA11604732	You are wrong that the quality of the school does not matter.  This is especially true if you eventually want a master's in accounting or an MBA.  My advice would be to avoid the CSU schools.  None are very selecctive and none will help you if you want to get a graduate degree.<br>  <br>  In addition to going to a school to get a degree in accounting, you might also want to go to a school that offers a BS in Business Administration, where you can do a concentration in accounting.  If you go to a good school, this will actually give you more options -- allowing you to become a CPA -- but also allowing you to do other areas of Business.  I know that you want to get away from the Bay Area -- but Berkeley has one of the best accounting departments in the world.  They offer a BS in BA through the Haas school.  Any of the UC schools that offer business as a major woulf be better than a CSU school that offers accounting.

The animals over throw the Farmer, they form a manifesto "All animals are equal". The pigs gather a strangle hold in a counter revolution, they add it it "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others" Hence the pigs justify their abuse of power.<br>  You have to remember Orwell wrote when communism was at its violent most pinnacle e.g. Stalin....

It is an urban phenomenon, and my take on it is that it indicates not only more than one location, but refers to the "scene" as a whole, including restaurants, nightclubs, bars, cocktail lounges, and theaters.  Typically, the purpose of these places is to come into contact and become minimally acquainted with those one wishes to not only socially, but sexually, communicate with. Activities include modern mating rituals such as dancing, drinking alcoholic beverages, listening to live musical , theatrical, or comedic performances, dining in restaurants, and displaying talents to those one wishes to attract and subsequently have sex with,  such as billiards, mechanical-bull riding, dart-throwing, and gambling. Participants don mating attire which often differs radically from apparel worn at any other time, in an effort to attract the type of mate sought. . .|`|eca735eb563a6a25bedeef0050127389aa	"Sashay and cabaret" - going out to the clubs to boogie or rock late at night

AA10176626	Well, Amy - there are a number of ways to approach this question - you'll have to decide which one seems more appealing to you.<br>  <br>  One obvious way that furthering your education will enhance your ability to contribute to society is that your education will (hopefully) qualify you for a career that you otherwise wouldn't be able to gain entry to. If you're interested in some sort of "helping" profession, there's an obvious essay in there somewhere. If you're going to be a nurse, or a doctor, or a lawyer, or a teacher, or a police detective, or a medical researcher, or a speech pathologist, or whatever - you're going to "make a difference" in peoples' lives - and your education will open up the doors to those opportunities.<br>  <br>  If your goal in life is to be an IRS auditor (apologies to IRS auditors everywhere), the connection between your working life and your contributions to society might be a little more vague.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's not your career that will enable you to "make a difference" - maybe you're interested in the kinds of educational opportunities that will engage you in some of the world's problems - maybe you'll learn about the socio-political issues in some far-away conflict, and the lessons will lead you to get involved in charities and service organizations - maybe you'll become a mediator with the United Nations.<br>  <br>  Maybe your education will inspire you and open up new ways of seeing the world - lessons that you will be able to pass to your children and your community.<br>  <br>  You'll need to give this question a little more thought - as you can see, it is intentionally vague - and there is no correct "answer". You're not going to be evaluated on whether you give a "correct" answer, you're going to be evaluated on how well you write, how well you marshal your thoughts, and how well you can present the case that you'll be a "somebody" when you're done, and not another nameless, faceless follower walking amongst the crowd.<br>  <br>  Let your imagination run wild and put it on paper.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

You can do whatever else you want have a double major, a minor etc...<br>  <br>  I encourage to double major in education. You can get a great teaching job if you dont get accepted in Medical school.<br>  <br>  The pre-med requirements that you need to complete while in college are:<br>  Biology (I &II), Chemistry (I &II), organic chemistry (I &II), physics (I &II), Calculus (I &II), English composition (I&II). Extra classes to make your self competitive are : anatomy & physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Statistic.<br>  <br>  You need a cumulative college GPA of 3.5+<br>  <br>  You also need to have research experience and clinical experience. Shadow a doctor or something. My advice to you is become an EMT or an RN while you complete your pre-med requirements, this will give you plenty of clinical experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  MCAT: you need to ACE the medical entrance exam known as the MCAT 35+ should be your goal.

rgNP0Qo6aa	Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!
8RCOlWdMaa	I have done the OU and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is good because you can choose your own course profile and so can tailor it for your own interests.

Hope this helps! Good luck.

Talibans are the best in gorrila warfare. Also in first afghan war USA sent hell lot of weapons to defeat Russia. thats why there is no shortage of weapons here either.Pakistan made many outpost with the border but the American and nato don't even want to go in this area neither the ANA ( afghan national army ). The caves give extra ordinary protection even from bunker buster and carpet bombing. These are the reason the British never conquered this area by force in 18th century. The Russians tried but failed too in 19th century. and now the Americans and nato. The biggest difficulty here is TERRAIN|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	Dangerous for whom?

That place is used as the hiding place for the terrorist who are escaping the Pakistani and NATO forces. In 1980, the CIA and the American forces used the tribal area located in the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan to fight the russians. After the Russians were defeated by the Taliban, the taliban took control of the whole region and their strong bases were near the Pakistani border. After the terrorist attacks on US, the Talibans were labelled as terrorists and Afghanistan was Invaded. The only safe place for them was somewhere not in Afghanistan and that made Pakistani-afghani border area the best area for them since the people in the tribal area were very religious and uneducated. Slowly the terrorists (the taliban) spread the roots in THis whole region using guerella war tactics to fight the large number of forces from Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The only day you DON'T want to count is the 1st,  so the number of days is (8 - (2 less 1)) = 8 -1 = 7.<br>  <br>  Right, so the interval from 2nd to 24th is (24 - (2 less 1))  =  23 days !<br>  <br>  (that is, including both the 2nd and the 24 in the count).<br>  -------------- -------------------- ----------------- ---------------------<br>  And just to make the idea more general, suppose you wanted the number of days from the 10th to the 29th --<br>  <br>  You have 29 days up to the 29th, but this includes the days from 1 to 9, which you don't want included, so you have to subtract 9 days from the 29, giving you 20 days --<br>  <br>  The sum, again, is (29 - (10 less 1))  = 20 days.<br>  <br>  If you didn't want to include the 10th and the 29th themselves in the count, then the sum would be<br>  <br>  ((29 less 1)  -  10)  =  18 days.|`|VkWVV1SDaa	22  You are including the 24th|`|AA12218857	22 days because the use of the word inclusive suggests that you should include the 24th.|`|z6ZNrN2paa	If you think of a smaller interval - say between the 2nd and the 4th - it's clear that you subtract the dates and then subtract one.

lGRKVihaaa	the answer to th first one is option 4.  That's because there are 2 answers for most absolute value questions because the answer can be negative and it will end up turning out to be positive, or an answer can be positive, and it'll end up turning out to be positive, because absolute value is always positive (it's the numebr of spaces away from zero).  For number 1, what you will need to do first is ignore the absolute value signs and treat them like parentheses.  So, first distribute the 3 to the (x-8).  You get 3X-24=132.  Then you try to isolate x, and so you add 24 to both sides and you get 3x=156.  Then you divide both sides by 3, and you get x=52.  Then you do the same thing, but make it equal to negative 132, because again, absolute value solutions can have 2 solutions.  Then, you get 3x-24=-132.  Then you add 24 to both sides and you get 3x=-108.  Then, you divide both sides by 3, and you get x equals -36.  Therefore, option 4 is correct.<br>  <br>  The answer for question #2 is option 3.  For this one, what you will need to do is solve each equation, until you get the solutions x < -6 or x > 11.  So, for option 1, you know that it cannot be true, because the answer to an absolute value equation can never be negative.  So, option 1 can be crossed out.  If you solve option 2, you get 5x-25>50.  Then you would add 25 to both sides, and you get 5x>75.  When you divide both sides by x, you get x>15.   x>15 is not x < -6 or x > 11, so you can automatically eliminate that one.  For option 2, you would have 20-8x>68.  You would subtract 20 from both sides and you would get -8x>48.  Then you divide -8 from both sides, and you would get x<-6.  (You switch the signs whenever you divide or multiply by a neg. #, and in this case you're dividing by a negative number, so you would have to switch the sign.  Next, you would need to set it equal to -68, because there are two solutions for absolute value problems.  For inequality absolute value problems, to find the second solution, you need to switch the sign, and make the number a negative.  You would have 20-8x<-68.  You would subtrack 20 from both sides and get -8x<-88.  You divide both sides by -8 and get x>11 (becausem you have to switch the signs because you're dividing by a negative number).<br>  <br>  For the last one, the answer is no solution.  That's because you can have absolute value equal a negative number.  Although, the absolute value for this one is separate, it still can't work out, because if you do what I taught you, and solve for x, none of the other options get you the answer you're looking for.  So, the answer is option 4; no solution.<br>  <br>  Well this is it!  I hope i helped and good luck with your homework! =)
I2F2Padgaa	The A-levels are not very important as long as they are academic. Subjects like English, Law, Sociology etc are useful. Basically any subject that involves essay writing.<br>  After that the quickest way is to do a law degree. Some uni's prefer if you have an A-level in law whereas some don't so research which uni you want to go to before you choose your A-levels.<br>  After your law degree which is about 3-4 years, if you want to be a solicitor its another 3 years i think. So a total of about 6 years.<br>  For a Barrister its about 7 years altogether i think. <br>  For both professions it costs alot of money to actually get to the job and there is alot of competition but once you're there you can make up your debts. Not everyone gets to the job though so you may want a back up plan.|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Firstly you will need to have your sense of morality removed along with your soul.|`|x0rqNORPaa	Get your bachelors in w/e with around a 3.4-3.8  average and score well of the LSAT.

No doubt you will be knocked back a few times but if it is really what you want then go for it. Just keep trying is all i can say =)<br>  <br>  The A-Levels aren't so important, it's just really getting the points for university. I would recommend taking A level Law as it does give you background knowledge of the law, which i certainly found useful especially starting the degree. Other than that i would suggest taking the subjects that you enjoy and think you will do well in. <br>   <br>  After that the quickest way is to do a law degree. <br>  <br>  If you go on to become a solicitor then you must have a law degree. If you choose to do a non-law degree at university then you will have to do the conversion course (GDL) to change your existing degree into a law one. You then take the LPC which is a year course. After the LPC you then have to complete two years of a training contract to qualify as a solicitor. The training contract is the most difficult to get hold of. Many people will complete the LPC and not even get a training contract, so like i said you need to be hard - working and determined. <br>  <br>  If you choose to become a barrister then you must have a law degree and if not then must take the GDL conversion course. You then go on to take the BVC and then once the BVC is complete you then have a 12 month pupillage with a set of barristers' chambers. Then you will be fully qualified. <br>  <br>  It might also be worth considering that it can be quite expensive. Currently the LPC is in the region of ￡8,000 - ￡11,000 and the BVC ￡10,000 - ￡13,000. I don't want to put you off, but you need to be aware of the hard - work and competition out there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	Face painting is always a good carnival-type activity. You should be able to get some face paints at Michaels (see first link below) or any other type of crafts place. Think up some good designs beforehand; spiders, lightning bolts, <br>  <br>  Do you have a digital camera and a photo printer? After the kids are done with face painting, you can take a picture of each child, print it out, and have them decorate their own picture frame. That will give them something they can take home. You can buy 12x18 inch foam sheets at Michaels and cut them into quarters (see second link below), and glue their picture in the middle of each sheet. Then they can take foam pieces and stick them around the edges. <br>  <br>  You can also buy six helium balloons, tie a ribbon to each one, then punch a hole at the top of each frame and tie the frame to the balloon in the middle of the ribbon. Weigh down the bottom end of the ribbon using another balloon filled with sand (so the balloon doesn't go flying off). The balloons might be a bit much, though; you should check with your parents.<br>  <br>  For food, I would say pizza is the easiest, or else hot dogs. Popcorn for snacks.

They want change and reform---like President Obama.<br>  American progressives tend to support interventionist economics: they advocate income redistribution and they oppose the growing influence of corporations.<br>  <br>  Progressives are in agreement on an international scale with left-liberalism in that they support organized labor and trade unions, they usually wish to introduce a living wage, and they often support the creation of a universal health care system.<br>  <br>  In some other countries, the word refers to right-wing economic policies. In Ireland, progressivism refers to free market liberal policies of Progressive Democrats. European Progressive Democrats was a mainly liberal conservative group in the European Union.

q4hPRznvaa	The ingredients needed for performing it are as follows:<br>  <br>  - A few toy cars – preferably four toy cars made of plastic.<br>  <br>  - Donut magnets – get double the number of donut magnets as the number of cars that are being used. In fact, the more magnets you use, the better the results are going to be.<br>  <br>  - Elongated cardboard case, preferably the type used to hold tubelights.<br>  <br>  - Cellophane tape and scissors.<br>  <br>  - Thermocol.<br>  <br>  - Colored paper and other toys for decorating the set-up.<br>  <br>  <br>  The first step is to find out which poles of the donut magnets are similar poles by bringing each magnet close to one magnet set as a standard. Once you have located the same pole in every donut magnet, fasten the magnets to the toy cars using cellophane tape in such a way that the same poles face outward.<br>  <br>  Now for the tracks – make a latitudinal section of the cardboard case. Only one half shall be used for the experiment. It should have the same width as that of the toy cars, and be around a couple of meters in length. Now arrange them at a slight angle (approximately 3~5 degrees) to the horizontal plane using the thermocol. Attach a block of thermocol at the bottom as a dead end. At the top, leave around thirty centimeters of the track parallel to the horizontal plane. Line up the cars one by one. Place blocks of thermocol at regular intervals along the track in order to provide support to the entire set up. Also, make sure that the sides are vertical. Otherwise, the cars might fall over.<br>  <br>  Now roll one car at a time to the track and release it. They will reach the bottom. However, adjacent cars would never touch due to the repulsive force created by the similar poles of the magnet, and you will observe a spring-like effect each time a car approaches the previous one.<br>  <br>  This quick and easy science fair project can be decorated using the colored paper and toys. It illustrates the fact that the like poles of two magnets repel one another.<br>  <br>  If you don't have those supplies try these websites:<br>  <a href="http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com..." rel="nofollow">http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com..." rel="nofollow">http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com...</a>|`|WpaQKpckaa	pick a project at the bottom of the page where it says projects:  <a href="http://is68.org/?q=node/222" rel="nofollow">http://is68.org/?q=node/222</a><br>  <br>  answer me: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222151352AAiuqrj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|JoIjYhNQaa	You could do does the size of a magnet have anything to do with how strong the magnet is.

5lXouSKAaa	Relate to how the seasons change throughout the year.<br>  Note the differences (what makes it special/significant) in each rock cycle and the changes that “Jack” goes through.|`|iM6VdCdoaa	(pronounced /?du?na?t/ or /?d?na?t/) is an igneous, plutonic rock, of ultramafic composition, with coarse-grained or phaneritic texture. The mineral assemblage is greater than 90% olivine, with minor amounts of other minerals such as pyroxene, chromite and pyrope. Dunite is the olivine-rich end-member of the peridotite group of mantle-derived rocks. Dunite and other peridotite rocks are considered the major constituents of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about 400 kilometers. Dunite is rarely found within continental rocks, but where it is found, it typically occurs at the base of ophiolite sequences where slabs of mantle rock from a subduction zone have been thrust onto continental crust by obduction during continental or island arc collisions (orogeny). It is also found in alpine peridotite massifs that represent slivers of sub-continental mantle exposed during collisional orogeny. Dunite typically undergoes retrograde metamorphism in near-surface environments and is altered to serpentinite and soapstone.<br>  <br>  Dunite may represent the refractory residue left after the extraction of basaltic magmas in the upper mantle. This is the type of dunite found in the lowermost parts of ophiolites, alpine peridotite massifs, and xenoliths. Dunite may also form by the accumulation of olivine crystals on the floor of large basaltic or picritic magma chambers. These "cumulate" dunites typically occur in thick layers in ultramafic to mafic layered intrusions, associated with cumulate layers of wehrlite, olivine pyroxenite, harzburgite, and even chromitite (a cumulate rock consisting largely of chromite). Small layered intrusions may be of any geologic age, for example, the Triassic Palisades Sill in New York and the larger Eocene Skaergaard complex in Greenland. The largest layered mafic intrusions are tens of kilometers in size and almost all are Proterozoic in age, e.g., the Stillwater igneous complex (Montana), the Muskox intrusion (Canada), and the Great Dyke (Zimbabwe). Cumulate dunite may also be found in ophiolite complexes, associated with layers of wehrlite, pyroxenite, and gabbro.<br>  <br>  Dunite was named by the Austrian geologist, Ferdinand von Hochstetter in 1859 after Dun Mountain near Nelson, New Zealand. Dun Mountain was given its name because of the dun colour of the underlying ultramafic rocks. This color results from surface weathering that oxidizes the iron in olivine in temperate climates (weathering in tropical climates creates a deep red soil). Dun Mountain is separated from its sister massif, Red Mountain, at the southern end of South Island, New Zealand, by the Alpine Fault, an approximately 600 km long right lateral strike slip fault similar to the San Andreas fault in California.<br>  <br>  A massive exposure of dunite in the United States can be found as the Twin Sisters Peaks, near Mt. Baker, in the northern Cascade Mountains of Washington State.

lXlmdChpaa	some great songs include-<br>  the lonesome death of hattie carroll, the times they are-a changin', hurricane, subterranian homesick blues, masters of war, like a rolling stone, blowing in the wind, my back pages...<br>  <br>  "the times they are-a changin"..controversy was made over his criticism and suggestion of changing society..this gave dylan a label as a controversial singer/songwriter in the sixties as he began to speak out against society. (some thought of him as a rebel and did not think dylan's music should be accepted..as with many of the popular artists)<br>  <br>  obviously bob dylan was a very important figure during the sixties (as well as through out his standing career) and in my opinion was a spark to many of the social/government realizations and revolutions..in all of his songs he tells of his opinions of society and its flaws..including corruption in the government, racism, "higher society"/ class, war, self reliance, etc..<br>  i personally think that dylan is a musical genius and deserves much credit for changing the uptight and volatile society that existed in his times as well as to opening doors for other performers during the time..you can find connections or any other information from his work by analyzing the lyrics and thinking about the message bob is trying to send, though he is not always very straight forward about what he is specifically saying about. of course some knowledge about this time would also help since that would give better background for song references and explanations. <br>  good luck and i hope this helps make a base for your paper.. but bob dylan was a great choice for a  topic !

AA11146651	First, try to summarize the problem.  You know that:<br>  1.  (.01 x Pennies) + (.05 x Nickels) = $2.58<br>  2.  Pennies = (2 x Nickels) - 36<br>  <br>  Now, substitute the Pennies in #2 for the Pennies in #1, like this:<br>  .01 x [(2 x Nickels) - 36] + .05 x Nickels = $2.58<br>  <br>  Then solve it, like this:<br>  (.01 x 2N) - (.01 x 36) + .05 x N = 2.58<br>  .02N - .36 + .05N = 2.58<br>  .07N - .36 = 2.58<br>  .07N = 2.94<br>  N = 42<br>  <br>  Finally, plug the 42 Nickels into either of the equations above to get the number of Pennies, which is 48.

TRUpkxWwaa	i would say emotional because he chose to help his friend over doing his math homework. It was nice of him to help but its not like he was physically unable to do it ie: he got hit by a drunk driver on the way home from mardi gras and had to get his right arm amputated. But in my opinion this kid is a lying bastard just trying to get out of a zero. He probably dosnt even have friends to help.

More information is needed.<br>  <br>  You'll have to summarize what happens with Gene and Finny in the book pointing out how they are able to restrain themselves from doing whatever might be negative to their development in this book.  It just means that their is a mean or saddistic side to human nature and that sometimes particularly before we reach the age of 24 (research has indicated that's when the frontal lobe of the brain which controls decision making and impulsivity develops to its fullest) that our choices are not always good.  You may need to do a bit of research to support your opinion.|`|h7eD3GPZaa	Most people have their normal, rational, concious self that is around most of the time, but sometimes judgement gets impaired and they give over to their darker side.<br>  The question is asking you to talk about how Gene and Finny face their wilder desires and desicions as they grow up and how this affects their lives. You could probably talk about the conflicts they have between themselves and the people around them.

AKA Saltwater!|`|AA0MuMt3aa	Think sciencey!!<br>  What's the actual chemical reaction for a nail rusting?<br>  Well, what are nails made of..?<br>  Iron!<br>  What happens when you put them in water..?<br>  They rust!<br>  Why do they rust..?<br>  Iron is a metal, and water is a chemical itself, so that means they must have reacted!<br>  <br>  In other words:<br>  Iron + Oxygen + Water -> Iron Oxide<br>  4 Fe+ 3O? + 6 H?O → 4 Fe(OH)?<br>  <br>  This reaction is called rusting, but the actual name for it is oxidisation. Oxidisation is any chemical reaction that involves oxygen.<br>  So, to think of more chemicals to mix with your nail, think of mixing your nail in other substances that contain oxygen and hydrogen (hydrogen because hydrogen is in water, and water is made up of oxygen and hydrogen).<br>  Research on the internet for chemicals that contain Hydrogen and Oxygen.
