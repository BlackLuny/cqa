ldIoqejGaa	Its bulls hit innit. It's like when they changed Opel Fruits to Starburst, its not the same!! Or when they changed Coco Pops to Choco Crispies but then changed it back due to public demand. I could go on all day :P ha|`|z0vf71k3aa	If they are tryin to make it healthy then they should call it "Salad Hut" or something.  Most people wont associate pasta with being healthy.|`|Cka4vgrcaa	I think thats just in the UK, here in the US they are just serving pasta but are still Pizza Hut|`|UjNFGJbOaa	pasta is good. i love it. esp. aglio olio n lasagne|`|QbalYOgnaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|68tEpCDYaa	It wont happen...|`|FSKiPO1Laa	no its still called pizza hut still |`|EDJ8heifaa	I think it may be a big hit with certain individuals, but nothing permanent.  I don't think the change is going to last very long.  It seems as though Pizza Hut is making desperate attempts to bring in more money and stay alive.  I'm not sure how many people will go to a Pizza Hut to get pasta when they can go to a fresh Italian Restaurant or even Olive Garden.|`|5RSHzT9Xaa	whay omg i love pizza hut nd i always have the salad bars thing omg not going there nw its changing :(((((((((|`|AA12316360	Oh please! It so does not have the same ring to it.  They should have stuck to Pizza Hut, kept the same in the way of fat based pizzas but a create your own style and centred more on skinny, healthier pizzas, healthier pasta and salads and done a massive, different ad campaign.  This will be pants.  |`|fGwBKEV2aa	It seems to me like a bit of a ploy to sound a little less bad for you... it's all a bit inconsequential really! And no, it definitely doesn't have the same ring!|`|FsYUBf6faa	yeah i know! How on earth can they change it to pasta hut?? But to be honest its a good publicity thing, i know i'm going to go to try out their new menu.|`|9RpMDlWsaa	That's SO rediculous....their pizza rocks! :) 
xGoqevxiaa	You can be any age during the day if you are accompanied by someone over 21, but after a certain time you have to be 21.|`|G13DBUcUaa	I knew someone who got hired there and she was 18.
aTkPvZQuaa	i agree didn't know they stopped doing deep pan .........................|`|kjFjGrOvaa	wow I did not know they were changing their name to pasta hut that is strange. They have enough advertising for us to know that they serve pizza and pasta so why the name change I do not know. I agree I loved the deep dish pizza the best the one here where I live still has it and I will be sad if they stop. |`|AA10045246	im sure its because you were just unfortunate with the people who served you<br>  <br>  but i dont understand the need to change their name completely<br>  does it mean they will soon scrap all pizza's and turn it into one huge lettuce palace?|`|bBRsQaRWaa	They still do ahve deep pan... at least where I am at. Thier not changing their name the pasta hut thing is for advertising the new pastas that they sell.  And never get delivery from any pizza place it usually cold when it gets to you.  Sounds like you pizza delivery boy needs fired. I would call corporate if it is smashed up they usually send you free pizza coupons.|`|Y7DBhONraa	They're not changing their name to Pasta Hut, you f_cking idiot!|`|ryEiHFOnaa	i agree, it is went down.. |`|xTb8u783aa	I nave had a pizza in pizza hut cold yet! and pizza hut very nice and yum yum i read the braille menu but it dont sound comussing to me or we get somebody to read it to us. when me and my boyfriend go there and i also like  the new toppings they had in the summber months. i  have also try Stuffed Crust<br>  the The Italian, Pan Pizza  and Cheesy Bites sometime we try them  i like the cheese bites <br>  <br>  and yes there chaging there name i seen it one of ours pizza hut in town to pasta hut so yes there are chaging.|`|yYbp9hSLaa	what?! they are changing their name to pasta hut? holy crap.. what i dont like is they only have marinara sauce for their pizza.. oh and bbq..i dont like pizza cuz of that sauce but other pizza places have garlic chicken with alfredo sauce which is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! but they dont have it. their pasta sucks.. but their hot wings rock my socks.. if only they refridgerated the blue cheese =[|`|G13DBUcUaa	I think you were just the unfortuntate victim of a bad situation, in this case because I still love the Pizza Hut by me. They aren't changing the name to Pasta Hut. It is just an advertising technique used to get people to buy their pasta. |`|2iaIRqMlaa	Trying to find them self, so many people have got healthy or cutting back because of the credit crunch.  Well we can do without it any way.|`|uAibwdMHaa	naw i dont agree bc i get deep pan ALL the time and it's hot and ready and ready to eat....come to texas........leave where u live @|`|b8bc0df3b725314ceaeaf729c6afe856aa	their shooting blanks everywhere just like dominoes new sub's??|`|DHTKiQP0aa	i dont like P.H it sucks<br>  the food is too fatty fat|`|kU29MvyKaa	i no bad init|`|qK5sThbAaa	OK, part-time Pizza Hut delivery driver here. I would EXPECT, not hope, EXPECT, that if a customer got what you received from that order, to call in to make a complaint. I am from a reasonably small town. Big enough to have a Pizza Hut, and 5 other places to order pizza delivered. So my delivery area is THE TOWN. A round trip for one order is about 18 minutes, average for me. Pizza should never be cold on delivery. Our Za Hut still has Pan, always will. And there isn't any change. The pasta is great, but they are not becoming Pasta Hut.|`|YpqOWxgSaa	I was at a mates party the other week. We ordered 4 pizzas and they told us they would arrive in 45 minutes. Nearly 90 minutes later they arrived. We payed and they left. We then opened them up to find one of them was the wrong pizza, so we phoned again, complained, and got another pizza free.<br>  <br>  So although the service was absolutely rubbish, we got a free pizza from it! =D|`|dw9Px8F8aa	well...I'm not sure I could really agree with that cuz the closest Pizza hut to me is HUUUUUUUUGE, and they are huge in business, and have good service. They get tons of money just cuz their service is so great when  they serve pizza.|`|voJ8XzuEaa	Pizza hut is the most unorganized, idiotic pizza place in existence. Instead of focusing on good food and good service, they come up with some new gimmick each month to get you to order. |`|wOwHliwjaa	Pizza Hut has taken a dive of late. I use to order them say once a month. But the quality is sadly lacking. I now use a rival. I would add it is not domino's|`|LzzE795daa	Yeah i know im starting not to like them.  It's sad they use to be my favorite.  Now i love Papa John.

bQraDPLUaa	OMG PLEASE DO NOT GO TO Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, Famiglia Pizzeria, or Sbarro– These are all national chains that have absolute nothing to do with NYC or its honed art of pizza! Don’t go to Bubba Gump Shrimp either, gross!<br>  <br>  Amadeus Pizza is a reasonable “average” NYC slice. <br>  <br>  Artichoke Basilles Pizza is an excellent choice and I would definitely recommend trying their Sicilian slice, which is currently being touted as the best on the isle. Their Artichoke slice is also really good but is not a true embodiment of “great NYC pizza”<br>  <br>  John's Pizza (on Bleaker) is straight from the heart and soul of NYC pizza – this is where you get the “great pizza” everyone refers to when talking about New York. Also of this caliber:<br>  <br>  Lombardi’s <br>  Patsy’s (East Harlem)<br>  Ray’s (only the Prince St location)<br>  Apizz<br>  Una Pizza Napoletana<br>  <br>  Brooklyn:<br>  Di Fara Pizza<br>  Grimaldi's<br>  Totonno's <br>  Franny's<br>  <br>  As for hotels the cheapest/coolest I know in the city is Ace<br>  <a href="http://www.acehotel.com/newyork" rel="nofollow">http://www.acehotel.com/newyork</a>|`|AA10640608	Any Ray's (all over the city) has a great NY slice but John's Pizza on Bleeker St. is one of the best for a whole pie.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	There are so so many places to eat pizza in New York City such as Thats Amore on Saint Nicholas Ave or Villas Pizza on 42nd St. I would suggest an online yellow pages to find all of your options for good pizza and you can also do that to figure out a hotel to stay at.

Be sure to call the restaurant first and make sure they take it!  I used a certificate I bought from restaurant.com and it caused confusion among the staff.   I had to keep explaining that even though it was a print out, I had already paid for the gift certificate.  They eventually took it, hence it was a good deal.  But, if the restaurant doesn't accept it, you're out of luck.|`|718ab341d8ab377300fb152c3ce9b024aa	I have actually bought about 5 gift certificates from restaurant.com.  I bought them at 80% off.

I know how that is, you find something your really like and get all the time and look forward to and they up and stop making the item.  Happens at every restaurant I have been to pretty much.  They have done the same in some stores I have been to where they have an item I absolutely love and they stop selling it, same with the Schwann's truck, I used to order from them but when they stopped selling my favorite item, I stopped ordering from them.

2pSHq0Lraa	Have you tried thrift stores they usually have nice ones...so does walmart...any ma and pa shop for furniture stores have nice cheap ones...I bought one at a place called oak furniture and it was a 6 seater for 310.00 great deal..look around town there are bargains to be had now a days..all the little shops would love to bargain with you for a sale...stay away from the big chains they are not willing to bargain.|`|vBQrHiIiaa	Ikea usually has good furniture for cheap.<br>  w/o a cheap quality.|`|vWFz82heaa	Look at ads for furnitures in the wanted ads, try Craigslist or the local junk shop/thrift store where you can mix and match. Even a surplus office supply store may have a conference table cheap.

The only pie I would order would be a double bacon cheese burger pizza on thin crust.  I don't know if they would make it for you, but you can ask if they still use cheddar instead of that white imitation cheese.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Whatever you decide, save enough money for some anti-nausea tablets and tums.

It's my favorite!|`|JwuEZCwzaa	I recommend the stuffed crust. That's always a good stand by. You can never have too much cheese... unless you're lactose intolerant. I've always enjoyed the simplicity of pepperoni as well. That's my recommendation.<br>  <br>  I will have to agree with the others above as well that the pasta isn't bad.|`|FslI1WyYaa	the pasta is surprisingly good. and they have really good chicken. the pizza hut in my town has the freshest salad bar in town.|`|1giK9hUhaa	Supreme Pizza is Great,..

You might not have eaten Pizza Hut, but you had to have eaten pizza before.
hel4ebsoaa	Spending time over coffee and bagels is a nice way to pass a couple of hours hooking up with your sister and inexpensive at that<br>  <br>  GOing to museums/galleries together and packing a lunch ....Most every major museum in Chcago has free days .

The later in the month it is the less expensive they become.<br>  You can pick the restaurant by area or by cuisine. <br>  I have never had a problem using a coupon just make sure it is valid for the day and time you wish to use it.<br>  <br>  Another option would be to alternate dining in and going out.  Pick a theme and one of you make the entree the other make a dessert. <br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that many restaurants have "early bird specials" if you can eat between 4:00-6:00 quite often the dinners are less expensive.  Many times with the special it is a full meal with a salad or soup, entree, and dessert for one lower price.    Lunches are less expensive than a dinner, portions are smaller that can be a good thing!<br>  There is a great French Restaurant in Arlington Heights, La Titi de Paris that has an amazing lunch special for under $20.00.  Many restaurants are now offering specials.<br>  Word of caution:  Not all "specials" are a great deal.  Check the regular price on the menu against the "special" price to be sure.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	Go to a comedy club, there are a bunch in Chicago. You can get food, drinks, and watch a good show! Its a good way to share the time and get each other laughing. There are a few in Chicago like Interactive Comedy Shows and Jokes & Notes. Call them and see what place would be the most affordable tickets or look at n online yellow pages for more : >
gJnXb9NIaa	I used to work at Pizza Hut and being a waiter is the lowest paying position in the chain. You have to rely on the tips to make decent money and there are some nights that are better than others. I think that if you are starting out in the work force and don't have a family to support and lots of bills to pay this is a good job. I would check and see if there were any other positons open there though, such as food prep, cook or even driver. I made almost as much money delivering pizzas from tips alone, as I did with my weekly paycheck. Good luck to you.|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	Since they dont serve alcohol, and the economy is so bad- probably not.  Also whenever I've been in there its always really white trash people eating there- white trashers dont tip.|`|vWFz82heaa	it's for a short time only I hope. If it is close by, and no hassle with the schedule. Sure. It's th first step to other jobs.|`|AA10804824	Take the job. It will get you experience to move on to a better one. I have served for 20 years at fine dining, privately owned places. I currently work at a steakhouse and work average four hours a day and average $84 a DAY.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Any job in this economy is a job worth having.  It's pretty simple work, but if they have the buffet tables, your tips will be pretty small.
vWFz82heaa	Depends on who your target customers. College students, adults, teenagers - it got to be relevant to them as well as inform them. If it is for guys or couples or families. Let this be your guide.|`|6rNmAqXnaa	Well since your name is R8, maybe you should do that. or something simple, but out there.|`|gtXcnGYbaa	namux|`|sGBRRpF9aa	flip it

PxJXJKCpaa	Pretty damned rude people down under, ain't they?  Every place has different rules about outside fights.  They have the responsibility to call the cops first and foremost, but I don't think anyone would give aid during the fight.|`|HL6kj8NRaa	Why are you buying that crap anyway?
b3hGPUGXaa	It may be legal but it is morally wrong. The customer gave the tip to the waiter/waitress not the busboy etc. Tips are for the waitress/waiter. Why do you think you do not need to tip at a buffet?|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Pooling tips is common practice in most restaurants.  Everyone except the owners can be part of the tipping pool.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	30% sounds like a lot to me... how do they even know how much you made when some tips are in cash?  Most restaurants do tip out based on sales... at my job we tip out 3% of sales.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I've had to annie up with bartenders as well, but never with cooks.  Just depends on who you work for.|`|vWFz82heaa	Only if the servers as a group have agreed to that policy as part of employment with the restaurant. Sometimes, I see as only fair if the kitchen staff is working their **** off. After tipping off the bar, busser... you should have 50-65% which is pretty normal. Just make sure you log all your tip outs so the IRS don't get you (they have free log books too!)|`|BI6iR0wjaa	anything is legal if you agree to it prior to starting work there. it's up to the employer to set the rules and if you don't like it you don't have to work there!!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	some places.. yes.|`|AA10804824	Never heard of tipping the cooks.
