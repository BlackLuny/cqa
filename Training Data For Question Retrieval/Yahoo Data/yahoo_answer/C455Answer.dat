e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Elsie,<br>  <br>  If your cabinets are natural and only have a sealer and/or clear finish on them, try sanding the area very lightly.  Be gentle and use a 100 grit type paper.  If it doesn't work or scratches too deep, switch to a 220 grit paper.  Again sand lightly.  It will come of gradually, depending upon how bad the burn is.  Once that's done, try to determine the type of finish used else on your cabinets.  It could be a gloss, semi-gloss or satin.  Gloss is the shiniest you'll probably see and satin is not too shiny.  Get a can of the spray finish/sealant that matches and lightly spray over the sanded area.  Try to dove-tail or blend the spray into the existing finish.  If you take your time you should be able to d a fairly decent repair job.  It's not that difficult, it's just that some folks harbor self-doubt and that prevents them from giving it a try and realizing they can repair it.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|1HQavOGOaa	Tibet almond stick|`|O4m7cKHCaa	First, get a small razor knife and scrape as much of the burned material out of the surrounding wood. Then, depending on how deep the depression is, you can sand down the surrounding wood so that it makes the edges blend into the depression. There will still be a depression, but it won't be noticeable when you stain it. it will look like a feature of the wood. If the burned area is really deep, you will have to remove the burned material until you have removed it all. Now you will have to cut the wood on each side of the hole to a cone like shape with points on the opposite side of each other. Don't make the cone shapes any deeper than the hole left from when you removed the burned material from the initial hole. You will now need to go to the hardware store and ask for wood putty that is colored to the shades of different woods or stains. Take the putty and fill the hole about 1/4 of the depth of the hole, let this dry and then add another 1/4 depth putty to the hole. Keep building up the putty until the hole is filled up. You may want to build up the putty a little higher than the level of the surrounding wood leaving a mound. Now, you can sand the putty until you get it flush with the surrounding wood. Before you apply stain you would want to sand a small area around the burned area to leave bare wood. As you stain the areas in the burned area, and the surrounding areas, they blend together. Let the stain dry and repeat the staining process again, let dry. The area should look like the rest of the unburned wood, and then you can apply a finish. As you apply the finish, try to feather the edges of the finish so that it will blend in with the finish that is already there. Now, you should follow the directions on the can of finish to get the area done. Good Luck|`|5X8SvT38aa	It depends on how big the burn mark is. If it's small try tuching it up with a little paint tinted to match the cabinets. If it's big your probably gonna have to sand and refinish the door. If it's big I'd call your fire insurgence company.

Put your hand on the device. if it is cold it is not using any or just a tiny amount and is of no concern.If the device is warm it is using power. The warmer it is the more power it is using.

Then fill them with light soil- something with peat moss mixed in to keep it light. Put seeds in these cups and keep them wet until they sprout. I've had as many as 50 or more seeds in a pot and it's fun to watch them sprout and grow. then you transplant them into larger or more pots so they can spread out. Just be sure to keep them moist.

You can get a couple of garden hoses and try and flush them out by flooding them but if you have a huge yard and many escape routes, you may need to resort to other means.  Killing the grubs that are in the lawn and any surrounding "food source" would be the first line of defense, followed by poisons which should ONLY be placed down inside of the holes so other animals don't get at them.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	nope -but you'll have healthier grass.  the moles burrow thru an elaborate tunnel system much deeper than an aerator can go.  talk to the local exterminator about the moles, so that you don't have to resort to poisons.|`|03sLrNPCaa	A aerator won't reach far enough down to do much damage to the critters, or even their runs for that matter.  They are just too deep. Trying to drown them with a garden hose won't work for the same reason.

Poison baits are a wash since the animals are strictly carnivorous, and don't waste your money on the so called sonic repellers.

I have heard the initial cost is a little high, but all the equipment you need will work for the remainder of your lifetime. <br>  <br>  I found a great site with detailed directions on how to can salsa:<br>  <a href="http://www.pickyourown.org/salsa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pickyourown.org/salsa.htm</a><br>  <br>  My mother-in-law cans all the time and loves it. She says it's a good way to relieve stress. I think she just enjoys to cook and garden. <br>  <br>  The cheapest way to find canning supplies is go to estate sales. <br>  Needed equipment - <br>  <br>  PRESSURE CANNER - with dial gauge is the most important equipment needed for low acid foods (this is the most expensive investment but will last for many, many years)Read all instruction on this pot because it has a few different tricks to it. <br>  HOT WATER CANNER - for high acid foods has to be deep enough to accommodate canning jar height placed on a bottom rack an inch off the floor of pot plus an inch or two of water covering the jars. (these can be bought fairly inexpensively) <br>  MASON JARS - these come in many different sizes and shapes (wide-mouth, plain or deco sided etc). Small, 1/2 pint, for jellies and jams, medium, 1 pint size are good for fruit conserves, salsa, salmon, etc., large 1 quart size is best for multiple portion meals such as meats also small pickles whole or sliced, X-large, 1/2 gallon, great for bigger whole pickles and large family size soups etc. Always make sure you have enough jars on hand for the. <br>  LIDS and RINGS - these come in all the standard sizes. Rings are not needed to stay on jars once the seals are complete. However it doesn't harm to leave on either. <br>  SPOONS - long handled, slotted, ladle <br>  KNIFES - large for chopping, parring, and vegetable peeler <br>  MEASURING - cups, spoons and scales <br>  TONGS and JAR LIFTER <br>  JAR FUNNEL <br>  SPATULA - non-metallic <br>  COLANDER or STRAINER <br>  TIMER
0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	Depends where you live, I'm in Australia and they are to be completely phased out over the next few years.<br>  <br>  Once they decided to go eco friendly the bulb companies have been working on many new varieties.  My electrician says they now have dimable varieties even dimable florescents.  LED ones are also being replaced.  It wasn't that long ago that only really large ones where available now they come in all shapes and sizes.  Prices have come down too but the savings in you electricity account are really worth it.|`|aEadwhXQaa	As long as there are popular fixtures that need bulbs, the bulbs will be for sale.  Dimmer switches require incandescent.  LED fixtures are still pricey as retrofit units.  Eventually incandescents will go away,but no time soon.<br>  <br>  my 2 cents|`|O4m7cKHCaa	In the U.S. they are slated to be phased out in 2 years. However, there will be some specialty incandescents available for fixtures that won't accommodate the compact bulbs. My experience of using them for the last year and a half has been disappointing. They don't give off enough light, and some have burned out way before they were supposed to. I have a 3-way lamp that is too small for the smallest 3-way compact bulb they make. So, I have to use the old style incandescent until they phase them out.
yMVdKHhmaa	by the sound of it you need to polish it, I work with Limestone which is softer than granite. if you use a course sanding disc of about 24 grit that should remove any roughness then finish it off with a 80 grit which will leave it smooth and glossy. seal it using a stone sealer like stone fix.<br>  <br>  any good supplier of Natural stone tiles should be able to provide you with materials that you'll need.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|AA10097817	Yes, they sell granite sealer, which is what you might want to be doing to your indoor counter top.

6N3yjlXhaa	What is under the carpet and padding?  Maybe you could get rid of the carpet and go with bare floors and rugs.<br>  <br>  Or a professional carpet cleaning service may be able to clean and disinfect the carpet. <br>  <br>  Your husband can wash down the walls.|`|DzRLYAAJaa	Have a professional carpet cleaner come in and see if they can do anything with the carpets. If they can't, then you leave the house and have the hubby with a couple buddy's come over and rip out the carpets in those rooms. Then clean the entire room down with 50:50 bleach:water solution. Make sure you don't do it because that mold and whatever it is may damage your baby.
AA11982228	Use "pipe dope" (that thick, grey stuff that comes in a can that you brush on the threads), instead of the tape.  Then, crank it down very tight with a wrench.  Hand tight will not be enough.|`|5X8SvT38aa	What type of plug is this? If it never needs to be removed again glue the thing in place. Call your nearest plumbing supply house.|`|0a4bd4d0b27788668da04d42dbfa8c22aa	Are you wrapping the teflon the right way ? Wrap it in the direction of the fitting .For example : If you are holding the square part of the plug in your left hand and the threads are on the right wrap the teflon tape over ( over your left hand )the plug 3 times . If you wrap it the other way the tape will unravel when you tighten it . Also , use pipe dope with the teflon it ( rector seal is good or mega loc  home cheapo rector seal  ) <br>  Use both teflon tape and pipe dope . Don't bury the plug  you can crack the fitting .|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	the problem is that you are using the wrong type of plug for below water line applications, you have an inspection plug that is not meant to be used for applications that will be holding water, you will need to get the right cap that will have a rubber gasket for a tight seal, you will need a sewer plug not and inspection cap|`|fNuMoHt7aa	pipe dope will work best. the tape may work if you put enough layers on very tightly. the problem is that the threads are too thick for the thin width of the tape and it bunches up.
Dvx9JquIaa	Your question isn't very clear.<br>  Do you have an old fashioned plastered wall that you are trying to connect into a wall with dry wall?<br>  <br>  If so, what I have done is tape the transitional seams as you would with dry wall and then add some texture to the dry wall to attempt to match the texture of the old plaster.|`|944iJNAdaa	I suggest doing the best job you can of filling the gap in with dry wall mud and tape (on the drywall side only, and this might take several coats), and then finish up with a caulked joint between the two.  Either that, or put a piece of wood trim up.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	They make a few different types of tape. One is simple paper for which you place a skim coat of mud then stick the tape to it and the other is a fiberglass tape with a sticky substance on it. Just trim and stick. The mud goes right over it.<br>  I used to do body work in a rusty place where we filled huge holes all the time with fiberglass and bondo.. For a big hole you can stretch a thin layer of mud embedded on a piece of cheese cloth if you have the patience to do it right and it does work. I've done it, but use very thin layers of mud because thick layers will crack. Just lay a thin layer, let it dry completely then repeat till you have what you want. That method takes a lot of time and patience, but the first posters idea works too. just cut a piece of drywall to fit the hole you want.<br>  If your question is only the tape then above, the first part works well..|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	Depending on the width of your joint if it is below the width of your tape you can load teh joint first with mud let it dry then tape it if it is wider use lathe to fill the gap and spackle over it. when either drys may crack if it is a deep joint. usually with a gap we will cut a peice of sheetrock to fill the void then tape and spackle it. Just make a wide seam to hide the transition about 18" or more, because the plaster is not straight like dry wall or the same thickness.; hope this helps
9QF6GGyiaa	Try using oxy clean. It works great for all my stains and you can use it for colors as well! I've also heard of detergent with a cup of banking soda.|`|6b779640bf250fccc59e09ede108d6ceaa	I would soak them in a bucket. Oxy-clean does sound like a good bet. Then I would scrub them with a toothbrush. Good luck.
LF7qeNskaa	Bikini wax|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Yes that area must be washed every day, and it the summer, when ur sweating, twice a day. I think most of us shave, I usually do the bikini are and then trim with hair salon scissors.  Hope I helped.|`|XzRKYYGsaa	Well When I bathe or shower which is hoer in the morning and bath at night , I wash there .. I get a gentle soap or I use the Summers eve Feminine wash , and clean it with that . There are also wipes you can get to use throughout the day to freshen up .<br>  <br>  As far as shaving you can get a trimmer , there are some made especially for bikini areas and use that if you do not like to shave there . <br>  <br>  But down there should be washed everyday , and in between baths and showers you can use the feminine wipes to freshen  up  , or even baby wipes ..Huggies in the light green package are good and the smell like cucumber and melon . I use those instead of feminine wipes because I can get a big thing and they are cheaper , and for my purse I have the smaller thing of wipes so I can freshen up when I am out .
3OeE8kMQaa	Depends on the lease... If you can get a short term lease or month to month at the new place then I'd say move. Living environment is so important in terms of mental health and can have such a huge impact on your happiness. Also I'd think that the stress of living without heat ect. would be more stressful then moving.|`|3Ophdo9raa	I'd say move. The place you're in now is a pit. You should be warm and comfortable in your home.|`|G8ESMK3Iaa	well if you are able to have a rent contract for a year, and your current landlord is not providing vital maintenance then I would move. You dont plan to buy a  house or another year as it is, but i wouldn't get REALLY cozy since you would only be there about a year, but you need heat!|`|DzRLYAAJaa	If it's going to be another year before you buy, yes, move out. You shouldn't be living in a slum lord's home.|`|oHsxp5weaa	You should totally move out! Just do it!|`|jRJKDceqaa	your choice|`|vtAywfhSaa	I just recently found a great two bed two bath apartment for my boyfriend for a great price and they told me this is a great time to rent. Prices are really low, prices go up in the summer because thats when everyone moves so I would do it ASAP. Plus this is a renters market. This year if you buy a home however you get a $7500 tax break. So this is a great year to buy. Either way, you should move!|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	Deoending on wher you are looking to live, I may be able to help. I run a company in NJ and have several homes for sale and would offer you a rent to own situation in one of our homes. But if you are not from the area this is a great time to buy prices are low but getting a mortage nay be tough without income. look for a rent to own possibly, but only if you want to be in that area. If you are in NJ and need a home feel free to contact us www.caparosoandsons.com we have many for sale, will offer seller financing or rent to own, or we can build or remodel one for you and save you 50% over standard costs.|`|AA11002791	Things are rough now.  Times will be getting harder.  If you have family that can help, you might need to turn to them. Maybe even move in with them temporary.  Getting another job might be a plus at this point.  Jobs are scarce.  If you have kids, get on the list with Housing and Urban Development, that way they can help you with the rent for the future.  It might however be a two year waiting list.  Save, Save, Save and Cut Back on the vacations.  Try the free things in life: Parks, libraries, and Get together with friends at Church.  Some Church groups helps in situations like yours.  Good luck, hope this helps.

After that you can spray with white vinegar and hose off.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	Surface cleaning won't work.  Whatever the porch floor is made of has allowed the urine to penetrate.  You're going to have to clean it, and re seal the floor.|`|XhtDtZK9aa	I had a cat that urinated on my carpet I used white vinegar and put newspaper over it did the trick .I don't know if it would do the same on a porch but its inexpensive and worth a try.|`|54b04613e0079baaf6c5ebe16657bf5faa	If it is just concrete, a mixture of bleach and hot water solution would do the trick.  Put it on there and let set , then put gloves on and scrub it with a brush. Rinse with hot water.
e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Bahiagrass does well in both shade and sun.    Bentgrass, centipede, dichondra, ryegrass all tolerate some shade.  Also St Augustine tolerates some shade.  Overall, you could plant as you said and find one that does well in shade, and then one that does well in sun.  I would go with centipede myself.  I have this type and I gorws well here in SC sun and shade.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|gFHTcIc8aa	If you live in area which cool season turfgrasses thrive (climate zone 6 (lower Indiana, Ohio, Illinois) or futher north), red fescue, chewings fescue or hard fescue will thrive in nearly fully shaded conditions. Plant these in your shaded areas.<br>  In full sun a mix of tall fescue and perennial ryegrass works well.<br>  In either case, good cultural practices (proper watering, cutting weekly during peak growth, weed control) are essential for best growth. I have had very good success in climate zone 7 with hard fescue in shaded area. <br>  But I am careful to insure lawn does not become drought stressed during hot summer months and weeds are controlled.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Agreed, fescues in the shade (fine, tall, sheeps) and ryegrasses in the full sun. Tall fescue can do well in either
5X8SvT38aa	That's like trying to boil a pot of water for tea using a match. There's a lot more water in a pool hat size then in a spa.|`|AA10097817	I would check with your local code office regarding safety issues.|`|SweUcu3Caa	There is a serious amount more water in the pool then in any spa. Products for a spa are rated for spas. It takes a long time and probably be more expensive in the long run not to mention it may even be unsafe. If you are looking for an inexpensive way to heat the pool try a solar heater i used to sell these and have been in pools that have used them. If you have a good area near the pool that gets good sunlight then a solar heater would be a good fit for you. They run anywhere from about $100-$600 and don't require electricity or gas. They hook right up in line with the filter in minutes and in good sunlight will increase the temp. on average about 10 degrees. Most local pool stores should offer them and can give you more details on them. If not check them out through www.swimtodaypoolservice.com. Also make sure you get a solar blanket for the pool as well. No matter how you heat the pool with out a solar cover all the heat you are adding is just going right back out wasting your time and money|`|NELaKi46aa	Try a solar blanket.

05b3af152124c775d5129804746bbc06aa	Legally, one should call the distributor, have them cut the tags and get them to re-seal after the board is changed. <br>  <br>  You also need to inform building control beforehand (part P of Building Regulations) . In practice if you call the distributor to inform them that the seals were 'missing' when you started and ask them to re-seal after you are done, then there is never any comeback.<br>  <br>  You can also claim an 'emergency' & phone the distributor on the day and get the Ok to snip away.

If so, all you do is call the electric company and they will unhook the power in the am and you will have all day to work on the panel and they will rehook in the pm.

KArPQEWuaa	Hi. Did you remove the drain plug on the new disposal? Assuming that the dishwasher drains through it.<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  <br>  The drain plug is located in the new disposal.

9dXCEE1Daa	If the molding you refer to includes baseboard and shoe, it might be best to buy or rent a finish nailer! If it's just thresholds, then you really don't need one. As for all the recommendations on saws, they're great ideas. We just did our whole downstairs. I bought about 10% extra, and we have enough left for one of the rooms upstairs (whenever we start upstairs...ugh...). It really depends on the room- what all you'll have to cut around and just how good you are. Best case would be to check the return policy- if it's something the store stocks, you could buy extra and then return any full boxes left. We made all of our cuts with a circular saw and jigsaw. Granted, we didn't have too many obstacles, but it was so easy to just mark it, go in the garage, and chop whatever we needed. The jigsaw cut like butter. We used it most. Definitely buy an installation kit with the shims and the tapping block! The block fits the tongue and groove so it doesn't crush. It you try to use a block of wood, you'll crush the edge and the next piece won't fit. And it has a bar for pulling pieces in when you get to the wall. You might want to check the width of the planks compared to the width of your rooms- we ended up with about a 1" wide strip at the very end, which we cut on the table saw, but that's extra waste if you get stuck with something like that.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	We had this done by professionals trust me it sounds easy to do but there's so much cutting it's un-real  you have to do sections at a time for it to expand & before you even attempt this job you have to put down padding & also you need a miter saw & have perfect measurements I'm not saying this can't be done by you I'm just saying there's more to it OK|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Add about 10%... about 620 sq. ft. should do it.

But your exercise ball is not strong enough to hold the shape of the ball without deforming.  If it does not have to be too heavy, go to the hardware store and investigate some of the expanding foams, and use it to fill the exercise ball, the weight of the foam would not be enough to deform the exercise ball.  If there was a type of setting foam or gel that was about the same density of water, then you could fill a container with water put in the exercise ball and fill it with the gel.  Then you are certain to get your almost perfect ball.|`|3RfHq80Naa	You're going to need something solid if you want to make an even mold.  It will flatten even with sand.  Also, a ball that size made of concrete would be far heavier than most people can lift without injury.  <br>  You could try filling the ball with water, freezing it and using ice atlas stones.  But they wouldn't be perfectly round either. <br>  Ok this might work: only fill the exercise ball up half way.  Hang it up so it keeps a good shape.  Combine two molds into a full stone.|`|acd2422384edc4d1cfde1cdb5a971fbeaa	Haha, you forgot to tell hem how much these stones are going to weigh.  I'm already loving that someone has suggested than it will be too heavy.  Look up Atlas Stones and Strongman.  Ordinary people wouldn't dream of this.  BTW if anyone is wondering, the heaviest stone we will be making will be roughly 370lbs and lifted an loaded up to something around four feet off the ground.  They get heavier too.

giCUEYsJaa	There are many ways to clean carpets.<br>  <br>  One is where they APPLY a dry cleaning agent on your carpet, agitate the chemical into the carpet fibers and then vacuum it up.  I do not prefer this method.<br>  <br>  The one I prefer is Steam Cleaning.  But be sure it is a truck mount - so that it has enough suction to remove all detergents.  Don't rent the steam cleaners at the super markets - all they will do is ruin your carpets because they don't have enough power to clean and/or remove the cleaning chemicals.<br>  <br>  STEAM CLEAN  - IT'S THE BEST!|`|fHA6zk07aa	Steam cleaning is a proven system and the best i think. Up selling is a known and just don't buy.Know what you want and stick to it. Make sure you get a reputable and that means an established company or reputation to be safe.|`|1ujQD20Maa	Well, i have to agree with you about steam cleaning. It has been my choice and if done correctly, it does the job. Pre-treating any stains is a must. I do not care for deep cleaning "shampoo cleaners". Shampoo cleaning to me, just grinds the dirt down into the carpet and nothing takes it out. Make sense? One mistake i made tho when my carpet was brand new 8 years ago, was that i cleaned it very often. MISTAKE!  in order to retain the stain resistant effectiveness of your carpet, you aren't supposed to clean it but about once a year. that doesn't mean you can't spot clean. Somehow when you steam clean, it can get too wet under the padding and cause problems, and the stains come back through. I haven't tried the businesses that use the needle injection cleaning under the padding. Expensive. But also, my mistake was, that after cleaning so often, i didn't spray the carpet with scotch guard after wards, not knowing i had cleaned it so much till i wore off the original stain resistant. voiding my warranty. Any way, hope this makes sense to you. Actually i have done just as good a job renting a steam cleaner and doing it myself as the professionals did, for a whole lot less. I just make sure i get a clean machine and i really look it over good first.  I mean, shoot, the professionals use the same machine on other peoples carpets before they do ours. Good luck tho.
9dXCEE1Daa	I'd clean the walls first. It's not like it matters if the bleach messes up the paint since you're about to repaint anyway.<br>  Prime first! Kilz is good. Zinsser is better. It's a lot thicker, so you get better coverage, and it blocks stains better. The Zinsser bullseye primer is my preferred product. Then you can use any paint over it. I'd avoid store brand paints- they tend to be thinner, thus cheaper, but you use twice as much. Buy some good sherwin williams, behr, benjamin moore. Better products really do make it easier!

It also depends on how much moisture is in the tree. The wetter the wood the heavier the tree.  The dryer the wood the lighter the tree.  Another point is where it is grown at.

Next, loosen the set screw and remove the pilot drill from the arbor.  Then clamp the piece of plywood to the piece of wood you want to drill.  Insert the hole saw in the hole on the plywood and slowly start the drill.  The plywood will act as a guide for the hole saw until it bites into the piece of wood.

qt0J7sB8aa	First, contrary to what one of the other posters wrote, one story houses do have load bearing walls. (they are why the roof and ceiling isn't sitting on the ground!)<br>  17' is a long span in residential construction. If that wall is running perpendicular to your ceiling joists it is carrying the weight of your ceiling, those joists, your insulation and anything that's sitting on the attic floor. Also if the bracing from your ridge beam comes down to the top of that wall, it's carrying roof load. There are potentially thousands of pounds the wall is holding up.<br>  I would strongly advise getting a professional to look at it.<br>  If you put in a beam, you are concentrating the load to what ever holds up the beam at the two ends. You may need to do some reinforcing in your crawl space if you are not on a slab.|`|e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	dogger,<br>  <br>  If you surf any web sites with similar forums or questions, they will all wind up saying the same thing---especially those sites where experts moderate the sites.  You should have an engineer or expert come and look at your project.  <br>  There are  host of other factors beyond just how thick the beam should be.  You have point load, floor support, and floor weight to be considered.  You may be able to contact your country building inspectors and they can come out and give you some advice.  But since your house was built in '57, that's codes that are 52 years old.  Lots have changed since then.  <br>  I simply wouldn't trust anyone to give me a good calculation, because they can't inspect your site and see if other factors need to be included in the equation.  The last thing you want to do is have to repair a sagging beam that doesn't bear the load properly.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11584500	You can get a lumber yard to spec out a LVL.  This doesn't sound like a huge load, but without looking in the attic....It may not even be a load bearing wall, but I wouldn't assume anything.  Being a ranch with rafters, and if the bracing from the ridge doesn't land on the wall, it may not be necessarily load bearing.  But then again the if the ceiling joist end on the wall...<br>  <br>  That's why need to get a professional to actually look in the attic.  You provide most of the information, length of the wall, pitch, but you also need to provide the horizontal span of the rafters.  Also, different regions have different design loads for roofs per code.  Another thing to consider is you are replacing a uniform load with two point loads, that need to be transferred directly to the foundation system.  It may require piers in the foundations.|`|NNbGdrPsaa	Plain and simple the architect is correct But if you contact a structural engineer in your area.He can tell you exactly what you need and more than likely the cheapest route to go in all aspects. His specifications will meet all codes and not jeopardize the integrity of the home.Remember any changes you make to the structure that aren't done to the building codes will get you lots of headaches and if something fails due to a snow load or storm damage insurance more than likely wouldn't cover it if is done without a structural engineers stamp.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Walters answer is the strongest header design you can make.  a single story house normally doesnt have load bearing walls. especially if it is trusses.

o0oYsQM7aa	It would be very expensive to pour concrete. I would build up the floor with pressure treated lumber and CDX tongue and groove 3/4 plywood. Lay a 30# felt under the lumber to act as a vapor barrier. Also a garage floor slopes towards the door. Usually 1/4 inch every four feet.<br>  <br>  Also consider that garages are not insulated. So it would save money in the long run to strip the walls, insulate, and re-drywall.

ispQWeQmaa	All refrigerators sold in America (or most other developed countries) must meet minimum energy efficiency standards. Those that are at least 20% more energy efficient than the minimum standard are labeled ENERGY STAR. So the first way to answer your question is to check whether the refrigerator is an ENERGY STAR fridge. A quick check in the energystar.gov website database shows that there are no models from Fisher&Paykel, which may just mean that the company has not chosen to apply for this label.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider in terms of energy efficiency is that side-by-side units are the least efficient type of refrigerator. The relative efficiencies are:<br>  <br>  Fridge only (most efficient)<br>  Fridge with bottom freezer<br>  Fridge with top freezer<br>  Side-by-side (least efficient)<br>  <br>  As well, fridges with a water dispenser or ice cube dispenser (or both) are less efficient than those without.<br>  <br>  The only Fisher and Paykel side-by-side refrigerator I know of is huge - if this is the one, I presume your space issues are that you need a lot of space to store food! This unit has a combined capacity of 25.6 cubic feet, which is about 8-9 cubic feet more than the typical big North American refrigerator. <br>  <br>  The minimum efficiency standard for side-by-side fridges of 24.5 or more cubic feet capacity is in the range of 690-715 (it varies by exact volume, type of refrigerant, and other features), so your refrigerator is more efficient than the standard. For a refrigerator to be ENERGY STAR qualified in that class it needs to consume no more than 552 kwh/year (for the 690 requirement) to 572 kwh/year (for the 715 standard). So it would appear that your refrigerator just barely scrapes by as being in ENERGY STAR territory, although it is not apparently ENERGY STAR labeled.<br>  <br>  Assuming you really need a fridge this big - for example, perhaps you run a catering business or have a huge family - you could also look at the Whirlpool GS5VHA*W*0* unit, which is a side by side unit with an ice dispenser, has a volume of 25.65 cubic feet and is about 10% more efficient than the Fisher&Paykel model.<br>  <br>  If there is any way you can get buy with a smaller refrigerator, or a bottom-freezer model, you will almost certainly save energy. Remember that 'energy efficient' when applied to a refrigerator is relative to its size, but in absolute terms energy efficiency just means using less energy. Not having a fridge at all would be the most energy efficient choice, but not one most people want to make. You can buy refrigerators of about 18 cubic foot combined volume that use only 376 kwh per year, which is again just barely ENERGY STAR qualified but uses a whopping 32% less energy than the unit you are considering buyuing.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	These days I can't imagine that any appliance wouldn't meet energy efficiency standards.  Look inside the door and ask your salesperson.  In the last 10 plus years, every appliance we have looked at is energy efficient.  It would seem a kiss of death not to be.  Who would buy?

81ff98a2b59a7150ffd94a3f4604b9e1aa	Kian Baby, you have tons of good advice here, let me add a few cents worth:  <br>  <br>  Do you have too many clothes?  Clothes that you don’t really like wearing?  Do you find yourself putting outfits on and then discarding them on the floor because you aren’t satisfied with how they look?  If this is part of the reason clothes end up on your floor, consider a wardrobe overhaul, put together outfits you KNOW you like, and consider taking a photo of them and printing them so you can plan what to wear for the next few days to a week. <br>  <br>  If you have clothes you don’t love, pass them on to someone who will love them, or just flat out needs them.  <br>  <br>  I totally agree that if you don’t like folding, use hangers.  I even use them for bras sometimes, and for pajamas.  Then, as you take things out of the dryer, hang them up.  I don’t like digging through drawers, because if I bothered to fold things up, they get all messed up.  Hangers solve that problem.  <br>  <br>  Consider painting the inside of your closet and investing in a few really, really functional organizers – yes, including hampers.   Have one for darks and one for lights or one for cold water wash and one for warm water wash.  This simplifies life on washing days and leaves more time for putting things away. <br>  Also, if your closet is pretty, you may be less likely to trash it, and you may enjoy putting things in it more than you do now.  <br>  <br>  Just say no to tossing things on the floor.  Repeat that a million times. You are simply CREATING UNPLEASANT WORK for yourself, because it takes more effort to pick something off the floor and deal with it, than to drop it in a hamper or hang it on a hanger in the first place.  <br>  <br>  Think through how you want to use your space and make sure that things that often end up on the floor have a designated spot to live in that is easy, accessible, and preferably attractive – like a shelf or a special drawer.  <br>  <br>  Think of your floor as a sacred, special place that allows you to move freely in your room.  You are only hurting yourself when you throw things on the floor.  And I mean that literally, if you’ve ever tripped on something on the way to the bathroom in the dark.  You say yourself you hate to go into your room.  Why aren’t you treating yourself a little better?  It is ok for you to take the time to treat yourself well by keeping your room nice.  Retrain your mind to consider the process of keeping the room tidy as a way of blessing yourself, and then just do it.  I heartily subscribe to the timer method.  It doesn’t have to be 15 minutes, it can be 5 or 10 or 15 or 20.  Using the timer shows you how accomplished you can be in very little time, and allow you to feel less oppressed by the job.  You can reward yourself often, both for progressing, and for finishing.   <br>  <br>  If you set your timer for a given amount every single morning and every single evening, and devote that time to blessing yourself by blessing your room, I think you will find that you no longer have a problem.|`|TZBrjuwkaa	if you have a closet and space in there hang your clothing up when its clean ,and when you are trying different outfits on just hang them back up. 2 isay get a box and de clutter any thing you don't use or want put in box and eather donate it or through it away. any thing that you don't want out put away.|`|8Ld9Dmgeaa	well you could put ur shirts in a closet... its not as bad is folding... i hate laundry which is why most of my clothes is of hangers =)<br>  <br>  will you do mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqVVL96jOImpQIw61Ub4ow_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224153106AA2wxfY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XNFvoIGxaa	Get a laundry hamper.

You could try what sweetpea said, the 45 minute thing that makes you sound like youre a human radar with compulsive cleaning disorder and heaps of time on your hands.

Now you have a clean surface with which to work. You'll have to go through your bedroom and look over -everything-! Decide if the item is a keeper or no longer wanted/needed.  Should you find an item you no longer want/need get a trash bag and put the item in the bag. Items you want to keep place on your bed. As someone has all ready stated work around the room going from the top working your way down. <br>   Once you've worked your way through the entire room you should have two distinctly different 'piles'. One the trash bag(which you'll take right out to the outside trash) and the other on your bed. <br>   Now you're going to have to find places for the items you want to keep. Once you've done this your room should not only be clean but 'organized' as well! <br>   The trick is to put an item back in its' 'home' after you've finished using it.<br>   Oh, don't forget to wash the windows and vacuum.<br>   Now you're finished.<br>  <br>   Good luck keeping your room clean and organized!<br>  <br>   Vincent Reagan<br>  'Hawkeye'<br>  <br>   :)<br>   ;)

00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	First off, unless you've got one of the best water saving shower heads and a huge tank, I have a hard time believing you could shower for nearly an hour with steamy hot water available constantly.    Secondly, Gas man and DVD are  wrong!   The dip tube does indeed carry cold water into the tank, and introduces it at about mid height, which is why the sediment that precipitates out of the water when it gets hot is allowed to accumulate on the bottom of the tank and not get sucked up and out whenever the hot water is used.     The hot water is drawn directly off the top of the tank, where the water is hottest and where the hot water travels to as soon as it is heated, to say the dip tube breaking off cuts down on the amount of available hot water is not correct.   If you're experiencing a decreased supply of hot water, the odds are your bottom element is burned out.  The top one may be getting weak as well, so as long as the tank has to be drained to remove the bottom element, changing the top one at the same time just makes sense.   If you plan on doing this yourself, you'll need to turn off the breaker before starting, drain the tank completely, remove the elements, (you'll need a special socket for this), and then reinstall, refill, bleed air off top, completely, and then, only then turn the breaker back on.
