zTcpZEm7aa	Usually pretty simple to install a new outlet directly above an existing one.  Leave the lower box in place but remove the outlet.  Cut the opening in the wall at the level you wish the new outlet the right size for a new box.  Run the proper cable from the existing box to the new hole, splicing the cable in the lower box, which you will cover with a blank cover ( I assume the lower outlet will be behind base cabinets).  Feed the new cable into the new box, then mount the new box into the hole you just cut.  They make boxes with ears for just the type of retrofit you are planning.  Connect the new outlet, install face plate and you are in business.|`|i1jV0xIGaa	Hard to visualize. Cabinets are usually installed near the ceiling.  But yes, outlets  can be raised and lowered if you have enough wiring attached to the outlet to move it around - or you can splice wiring onto the existing wiring to give you slack. Of course, you're gonna have to knock out some wall for access and to find out what you have to work with.  Might be easier to notch the cabinet to expose the outlet.|`|AA11241715	Chase a new wire into the wall to the new socket from the old one and either cover the old socket with a blanking plate or leave there. Use cable clips to pin the wire to the wall and a wire cover to protect it. Alternatively, use surface trunking to carry the wire. Make sure the wire is capable of handling your maximum current in your country. If it's a hollow wall, simply feed the wire through the wall using straightened wire coat hanger.|`|G5QC5f5baa	In the USA, local building codes generally determine whether or not you need a building permit and a licensed electrician. Per the National Electric Code (NEC) that all state and local codes follow pretty closely, you can only splice a wire in a box that is accessible. If the existing outlet is in the back of a lower cupboard, you can probably take out the outlet, splice in the box and put on a blank cover. If the outlet is behind the splash board or behind a drawer, it would probably be considered inaccessible.<br>  <br>  You also need to find out if revised wiring needs to meet new code requirements. If the old outlet is not GFI protected, put in a GFI outlet. If it is on a 15 amp circuit, it might need to be increased to a 20 amp circuit. If you have easy access to wiring in a basement below the kitchen, it might be worthwhile to upgrade the wiring if it is out of date even if the local code doesn't require it.|`|b207128f6213ea5411a368f91e6bb3d1aa	If you are living in the UK there's all sorts of hoops and jumps you have to go through nowadays. You need a qualified electrician with a P15 to do it, otherwise insurance, fire brigades and landlords (if you're a tenant) come down on you like a ton of bricks.
5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	The World Health Organization defines a live birth as the birth of any infant that shows signs of life regardless of gestational age. It is an imperfect definition, since infants under 600 grams birth weight stand little chance at survival.  Many countries cheat on the WHO definition and report as live births only infants above 800, 1000, or even 1200 grams as live births, and those under that do not survive are recorded as stillbirths. So yes, we are not comparing apples to apples, and the USA is not as bad as it seems when it comes to infant mortality.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, there is a great disparity in the US infant mortality rate between white and black mothers, something directly related to income and the access to good neonatal care.
9Xur3g9Paa	If you have 3 cc in the syringe, I assume the plunger is in the barrel and at the 3cc mark (that's why you know you have 3 ccs).  Unless your saline source is disposable, I would replace the needle so as not to contaminate the saline.  Hold the syringe, needle facing up with one hand and holding  the saline bottle in the other hand, puncture the rubber septum top of your saline solution.  Draw back on the syringe until the flat edge of the syringe is at or just slightly past the 10cc mark on the barrel.  3 + 7 = 10.  Without pushing on the syringe, remove the saline bottle, tap the side of the syringe to get air bubbles to the top (near the needle end) and GENTLY and SLOWLY push the plunger in to get rid of the air but be sure not to go below the 10 cc mark.  You now have your 3 cc of med and 7 cc of NS in your 10cc syringe and you are good to go.|`|EN32vSsCaa	Get a 10cc syringe.  Draw the plunger back to the 10ml mark.  Inject the medication in. Next fill it up by injecting NS up to the top.  Put the needle on.  Draw the plunger back a little more.  Mix by inverting a number of times, not by shaking.  Hold so the needle is pointing upright.  Tap on the sides to get rid of any bubbles.  Expel any air.  Now you're ready to go.
MIdK43wHaa	The planets rotate at a speed that is typically dependent upon mass, however this is not always the case.  Venus rotates only once in 284 days, and does so in a  retrograde (backward) fashion as compared to all the other planets.  Neptune rotates once each 16 hours (equatorally), Saturn 10 hours 14 minutes, Jupiter in just under 10 hours, while Mars rotates once in 24 hours and 39 minutes, and Mercury experiences one revolution on it's axis every 58.7 earth days.<br>  <br>  The other difference between the planets is the angle of alignment to the solar plane, or ecliptic.  Earth is tilted at about 23 degrees, while Jupiter is only tilted 3.13 degress, but Uranus is tiltes 97.77 degrees!<br>  <br>  So we have planets that rotate backward, travel around the sun on their side, and have days that are only 10 hours long.<br>  <br>  There is an elborate theory called relativity which attempts to explain bodies in motion through the use of gravitation, which is described as a "warp" in the space/time continuum.  Actually, gravitation is really an after effect of a much more pervasive control mechanism we refer to as electromagnetism.<br>  <br>  This single force can explain many of the discrepancies we witness when we look out at our solar system, and beyond.  Like the differences between our planets and how they behave.<br>  <br>  In reality, while there are differences, it has nothing to do with mass.  This is demonstrated in the fact that Venus has a retrograde rotation, and spins only once in 284 days.  There is a tendency for the outer gas giants to rotate at a much faster rate, from 10 to 17 hours, while the Earth and Mars both rotate at about the same rate.  <br>  <br>  Therefore the rate and duration of rotational spin of a planet is not dependent upon it's mass, but upon it's elctromagnetic orientation, the size of it's magnetosphere, and it's ability to conduct electricity.<br>  <br>  Gases typically conduct electricity much better than solids or liquids, so the magnetic fields surrounding the gas giants rotate at a faster rate than those of their rocky counterparts.  Venus has no intrinsic magnetosphere, but does have a weak magnetic shield cused by an interaction between it's ionosphere and the solar wind.  Therefore it's axial spin is minimal, and oriented retrograde to it's revolutionary path.<br>  <br>  It was thought for years that Mercury did not rotate at all, but was tidally locked into it's position because of it's proximity to Sol.  However this has since been refuted since satellite observation does indeed indicate that Mercury rotates once each 58.7 days.<br>  <br>  No one is certain of Pluto's rotational speed or orientation.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	The inner planets all rotate much slower than the outer planets do.<br>  The fastest-rotating inner planet is the Earth - 24 hours.<br>  The slowest-rotating outer planet is  Uranus - 17 hours.<br>  <br>  One reason could be the inner planets are closer to the sun, so tidal forces and the sun's gravity has a larger effect on them and has possibly slowed their rotations down.|`|SFjI6YAgaa	well some some outer planets are faster rotation than some inner and vice versa it all depends on the size.<br>  linda june is wrong
zF6zkFfbaa	If what your looking for is hands on all the way it may be difficult to find an online class but if it just learning A, B, and C in your head it very possible that the degree can be gotten online sorry I can't help out much.|`|GIqHMBOpaa	If you find the right site, you can get a doctor's 'degree' on site.  That doesn't mean you will have 'learned' anything, and I sure would not want you to be within even my same county, much less same town.<br>  <br>  Real World "exposure" that you have had would be a benefit.  However, the 'best' you could do via online, is to find a land college(s) that offers the specific type of degree you want - then go in person and discuss with them exactly what type/which courses that they would accept as 'transfer' credits into their programs.<br>  <br>  The only courses that might be transferable are probably going to be the first or second year 'basic' courses that most any student has to take.

It was created during inflation of the universe and fills its total space.  The Higgs particle, as I understand it, is massive and requires a lot of energy to be detected with particle accelerators.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Raccoons are well-suited for a vast array of ecosystems, although they are best adapted for deciduous forest biomes.  However, they are common almost everywhere in North and Central America, from Canada to Panama, from swamplands to tropical broadleaf forests to xeric shrublands to temperate coniferous woodlands to montane grasslands.<br>  <br>  Although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in the last decades, raccoons depend on vertical structures to climb when they feel threatened. Therefore, they avoid open terrain and areas with high concentrations of beech trees, as beech bark is too smooth to climb.  Tree hollows in old oaks or other trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping, winter and litter dens. If such dens are unavailable or accessing them is inconvenient, raccoons utilize burrows dug by other mammals, dense undergrowth, or tree crotches.  Since amphibians, crustaceans and other animals found around the shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of the raccoon's diet, lowland deciduous or mixed forests abundant with water and marshes sustain the highest population densities.  While population densities range from 0.5 to 3.2 animals per square kilometer (1.3–8.3 animals per square mile) in prairies and do not usually exceed six animals per square kilometer (15.5 animals per square mile) in upland hardwood forests, more than 20 raccoons per square kilometer (51.8 animals per square mile) can live in lowland forests and marshes.<br>  <br>  Due to its adaptability, the raccoon has been able to use urban areas as a habitat, such as  Cincinnati, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Toronto.  Population in large urban areas are typically about 50 to 150 animals per square kilometer (129–388 animals per square mile).  The range sizes of urban raccoons are only 0.03 to 0.38 km2 (0.01–0.15 mi2) for females and 0.08 to 0.79 km2 (0.03–0.31 mi2) for males.  In small towns and suburbs, many raccoons sleep in a nearby forest after foraging in the settlement area.  Fruit and insects in gardens and leftovers in municipal waste are easily available food sources
BDKqYOSraa	It is possible, but it would not be a smart career choice.<br>  These are two completely different specialties that have very little to do with each other (except both dealing with the brain).<br>  <br>  Neurologists are experts in the diagnosis and medical (non-invasive) treatment of neurological and cerebrovascular disease.<br>  Neurologists regularly treat such diseases as strokes (CVAs), epilepsy, parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, sleep/sleep motion disorders, neuropathies and a large variety of central and peripheral nervous system disorders.<br>  <br>  Neurologists perform and interpret several important neurological tests including electroencephalograms (EEGs), electromyelograms (EMGs), nerve conduction velocity studies (NCVs) and sleep studies.<br>  Neurologists do not usually perform surgery.<br>  <br>  Neurosurgeons use invasive means (ie. "surgery")  to treat nervous system disease. They are experts in surgically treatable conditions like certain forms of brain trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, surgically-removable tumors, aneurysms, spinal cord injuries and spinal/disk diseases. <br>  <br>  Neurosurgery training is among the longest and most rigorous in all of medicine. To complete a neurology residency and then go back and start all over to complete another 7 years of neurosurgery (while still retaining your skill-set from neurology) is highly improbable.<br>  <br>  Even if you spent the ~12 years in residency doing both, it would be very difficult to maintain your neurosurgery skills while running back and forth from the operating room to the neuro lab and sleep lab.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way: would you want a brain surgeon who only works part-time opening your skull?

Your best bet would be to mix a number of other substances. For example, I believe methane looks blue, so if you could combine methane with something red or pink you might manage a purply color. Hydrogen looks red, but an Earth-like planet would not have enough gravity to hold onto hydrogen for any long period of time. Another idea might be to have some kind of red or purple living organisms floating in the planet's atmosphere to give it some color, or even just to have a thick blue atmosphere and illuminate it using a red dwarf star, although I'm not sure if these kinds of solutions would work for you.

So hot that matter could not exist, not even the forces.<br>  <br>  For some reason (that the theory does not even try to explain), this extremely hot and dense universe expanded, and is still expanding.<br>  <br>  The Big Bang theory is the scientific explanation of this expansion from the state of extreme density and temperature.  It explains what happens AFTER the expansion begins.  As such, it is a very good tool.<br>  <br>  The Big Bang theory does not state that there was nothing.  In fact, it states that there was an extremely high density of energy.<br>  <br>  As the universe expanded, the energy density (therefore, the temperature) diminished and "things" began to precipitate from the pure energy.  First the forces, then the particles.<br>  <br>  All in accordance with the famous formula E = m c^2  (energy and matter are simply two representations of a common thing).<br>  <br>  So particles were created from energy,  not from nothing.<br>  <br>  If you try to use that theory for what happens BEFORE the expansion, we run into a problem.  The early universe was at some very high temperature (called the Planck Temperature, from the name of a scientist who worked on such problems): each point in the universe would have had so much energy that it would have been a black hole.<br>  <br>  This means that every single point of the universe would have been (from our present viewpoint) an event horizon (as exists around every black hole).<br>  <br>  From our frame of reference, time appears stopped at an event horizon.  We do not understand how time behaves on the "other side" of an event horizon.<br>  <br>  Therefore, we do not know how to apply the word "before", to whatever could happen "before" the time of the Planck Temperature.<br>  <br>  That, for us, marks the beginning of the expansion as it can be described by the Big Bang theory.  By extension, we call that moment the beginning of the universe, as we can perceive it.<br>  <br>  Some scientists are working on how the universe could have been in that initial state (in other words, what could have happened "before", in order to cause the state of very high energy density), but their ideas are not yet testable (they are not yet fully-formed theories).<br>  <br>  In one of these attempts [albeit a serious one], our universe is a sub-space of a much larger space with many more dimensions (up to 11) than ours (which only has 3 spatial dimensions).  In this space, there are sub-spaces (called 'branes, from the word "membrane" which is a 2-dimensional surface in a 3-d space).  They are working on the idea that if 2 branes collide in the multi-dimension space, the energy of the collision could provide the creation of an expanding sub-space (our universe).<br>  <br>  I don't really like the idea and I don't believe in higher dimensions.  But that does not make their idea wrong.  For all the universe cares, I could be wrong.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You think your desk if 13.7 billion years old?  Because that's when the big bang occurred.  Frankly, you're showing some very basic misunderstandings, and they're ones that show up here about twice an hour.  Why don't people ever learn?  Why can't you read previous questions and realize what you think happened is not what science supports?  Elements didn't start to form until hundreds of thousands of years after the big bang.  It didn't spit out your desk.  So you decide the answer must be magic?  Try basic physics, chemistry, and later biological laws.|`|a1VK1L64aa	I like to think that the big bang started from a black hole. But just as there are many types of suns and galaxies, I expect that there are few types of black holes as well. The conditions inside a black hole does reasonably appear to contain enough energy and matter in a small enough space to account for such an explosion. Given enough time and matter, the black hole continues grow and absorb pretty much everything until it reaches a critical mass and ignites in to the explosion.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	The current theories about the Big Bang state that matter as such didn't exist at the moment of the Big Bang - the universe was a very hot sea of plasma.  It wasn't until it had started to expand and cool that the lightest elements (hydrogen, helium, and some lithium) formed from that energy.<br>  <br>  So something wasn't created from nothing.  Energy was converted to matter (Einstein's e=mc^2 equation shows that a lot of energy is equivalent to a small amount of matter).|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Now one knows. As a few people have mentioned, the passage of time leads us to the Big Bang, but no further back. In my view, we can never know or even comprehend what was "before", if we can even use that term.<br>  <br>  It's easy for us to think of time as an imaginary line that stretched back infinitely. But reality works a bit differently. Take speed and temperature for example. You can't accelerate any further than the speed of light. Neither can you cool something down to below the Absolute Zero. Even achieving these limits is impossible. So is with time - we can go back along the timeline to the point of the Big Bang (never quite reaching it), but no further.<br>  <br>  Instead of imagining time as a line stretching into the past and the future, I propose to imagine it as a series of concentric circles. At the centre is the Big Bang, and each of the circles represents the passage of time, from the centre - outwards. If you decide to mentally go back in time, following from a circle to a circle towards the centre, you will find that once you've reached the centre you can't go any further in. The Big Bang is the point of origin. Asking what was before the Big Bang is like asking what is north of the North Pole.|`|m84nHutpaa	There is no answer to your question. And your desk is made of energy that only 'seems' solid. <br>  <br>  The Big Bang is BS... and it doesn't matter either way, because everything was here forever, or everything came from nothing.

HTmj2BXDaa	Having the iron well tinned helps handle the solder and helps with heat transfer to the part being soldered.  I recommend you wear safety glasses.

2E9V0sKfaa	I am not expert on this, so take this as a grain of salt, but i believe it is as a result of warm air being less dense than cold air.|`|HTmj2BXDaa	The previous answers are confusing the issue.  The answer is that sound does not necessarily travel faster in warm air, it may travel slower.  The reason is that the temperature only partly determines the density of air.  Humidity is a big factor in air density.  Cold moist air is less dense than warm dry air.  Warm moist air is less dense than hot dry air.<br>  <br>  Sound travels faster in dense things then in things that are less dense.  The density of a vacuum is very low (the better the vacuum, the closer it is to 0.000000000000 density) and sound does not travel at all in a vacuum.<br>  <br>  If you were standing on the shore of a lake and, as you watched, a hunter on the other side fired a rifle at you (and say you were just out of range).  You would first see the muzzle flash, then the bullet would splash in front of you, then you would hear the sound of the shot through the water, then you would hear the shot thru the air.   hope this helps|`|SDhKNBBkaa	In the search for a Northwest passage (around the north of Canada) one of the early explorers recorded that it was so cold that when a trumpet was being played no sound could be heard!<br>  However when Spring came and the air became warmer the music unfroze and could be heard.<br>  <br>  So - sound does travel faster in warm air and slower, frozen, in cold.<br>  <br>  Check this out...|`|TfwYPeV3aa	The speed of sound is equal to the square root of the medium's coefficient of stiffness divided by its density. If the density decreases, the speed of sound increases when the coefficient of stiffness remains constant.

Now you get V, T and n, so P is a breeze.<br>  <br>  Doc is also right.  You can the partial pressure route.|`|i1jV0xIGaa	Use PV = nRT for each gas. P = nRT/V.<br>  <br>  V will be 10 liters, T will be 25 degrees C + 273 to convert to degrees K; R is the gas constant 0.08205 liter-atm/mole degree K. n is number of moles    For N2, the moles will be 2.8g/28 g/mole. For H2, n will be 0.403g/2g/mole, and for Ar the number of moles will be 79.9/39.948 g/mole.<br>  <br>  for each value of n, calculate a pressure using <br>  P = n(0.08205)(298)/10 liters<br>  <br>  Add the pressures together to get total pressure|`|CYo6oisNaa	Okay, all you need to this is PV=nRT. You have to find the individual pressure of nitrogen, hydrogen, and argon and then add them up. To do this, first find the number of moles of each gas by taking the given mass and dividing it by the molar of the element. Also, you must convert Celsius to Kelvin, so add 273 to 25 to get 298 K. From here, you just plug in the volume of 10.0 L for V, the number of moles of each gas for n, 298 K for T, and 0.0821 L*atm/mole*K for R, and then solve for each indivual P. I didn't actually calculate the answer, but I think that you will be able to do that for yourself.
2ef5ca5a39098769a8dac8a2f3c15f57aa	You use Boyle's law, PV= constant.<br>  <br>  I assume you mean 575 mmHg as a pressure.  You must convert that pressure to atmospheres and then simply calculate a ration of pressures times the original volume:<br>  <br>  V = (1.00x10^6 mL)x(575 mmHg/760 mmHG/atm)/1.23 atm<br>  V = 6.15 x 10^5 mL

Furthermore, the amount of meat protein that is ideal/healthy for humans is FAR below the average meat consumption in most industrialized nations.

Even the smallest steak on the menu is generally twice the recommended serving size.  <br>  <br>  No, vegans aren't better than vegetarians (who can eat animal products such as milk and, depending on the type of vegetarian, some animals such as fish and eggs).  But neither are they in any way inferior.  So no, we will not "split as a species" along dietary lines.  Even if that were to happen who says that the vegans will not be more intelligent than the omnivores?

AA10267328	In dissolving in water, hydrogen bonds can form with the water and between water and the compound.
1Ox7si0eaa	Your confusion is justified. If water were included as a reagent in the reaction drawn, the reaction would actually go in the reverse direction and product the ammonium salt of the aldehyde. <br>  <br>  I believe the problem meant a catalytic amount of acid is present. That means that no acid is actually present. A small amount of ammonium salt would be present. I believe the catalytic amount of acid is to generate a small amount of oxonium ion to ease the loss of water from the reaction of the amino group adding to the carbonyl group (and after a proton transfer to the oxygen, after all an O(-2) will not be the leaving group). If oxonium is produced, water will be a better leaving group than hydroxide. <br>  <br>  You will find a similar mechanistic argument for formation of an enamine from a ketone in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid or the formation of an oxime from an aldehyde or ketone and hydroxylamine. The formation of an oxime is fastest at about pH 4. A lower pH will tie up the hydroxylamine and a higher pH will slow the loss of OH (as H2O). <br>  <br>  I will surmise this reaction will proceed to the product without the acid present. Secondary amines readily add to aldehydes in the presence of potassium carbonate. So the addition reaction to a carbonyl group probably is not aided by acid. <br>  <br>  Disclaimer, I am the author of "A Guide to Organic Chemistry Mechanisms" and "A Handbook of Organic Chemistry Mechanisms" (Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble or <a href="http://www.curvedarrowpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.curvedarrowpress.com</a> ).

WCICeezjaa	Everything!  A stem cell is the basic cell created in the early stages of development and they can grow to take on the job of any imaginable cell (except brain cells). Stem cells are what create genes. Without stem cells a human is not a human. Stem cells make it possible for a cut to heal, a broken bone to repair itself, hair to regrow.  Because they are the basic building blocks of the basic building blocks of life, they can be used to cure genetic diseases. For example: Sickle Cell Anemia is a condition that occurs when there is a genetic mistake in the DNA layout of the bone marrow. The stem cells can be used to produce healthy bone marrow to later be transplanted into a waiting recipient. The new marrow can now produce healthy red blood cells that cannot be produced with the unhealthy bone marrow. Further more, stem cells can now be created from the DNA found in a person's skin cell. You can, in theory, re-plan the layout of the body with the use of stem cells and correct the bad genes thus you can create an entire organ with the corect DNA to where the body won't reject it. Stem Cells are life. And so I ask you, why are we only using limited funds on a subject that is no longer an ethical issue seeing as embryos no longer have to be destroyed to obtain the stem cells.

YpUhEviCaa	Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and some viruses. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information. DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints or a recipe, or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and RNA molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.<br>  <br>  Chemically, DNA consists of two long polymers of simple units called nucleotides, with backbones made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called bases. It is the sequence of these four bases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA, in a process called transcription.<br>  <br>  Within cells, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes. These chromosomes are duplicated before cells divide, in a process called DNA replication. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store their DNA inside the cell nucleus, while in prokaryotes (bacteria and archae) it is found in the cell's cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.<br>  <br>  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a type of molecule that consists of a long chain of nucleotide units. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate. RNA is very similar to DNA, but differs in a few important structural details: in the cell, RNA is usually single-stranded, while DNA is usually double-stranded; RNA nucleotides contain ribose while DNA contains deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen atom); and RNA has the base uracil rather than thymine that is present in DNA.<br>  <br>  RNA is transcribed from DNA by enzymes called RNA polymerases and is generally further processed by other enzymes. RNA is central to the synthesis of proteins. Here, a type of RNA called messenger RNA carries information from DNA to structures called ribosomes. These ribosomes are made from proteins and ribosomal RNAs, which come together to form a molecular machine that can read messenger RNAs and translate the information they carry into proteins. There are many RNAs with other roles – in particular regulating which genes are expressed, but also as the genomes of most viruses.|`|DhcQC9DBaa	Dna is the master plan it never leaves the nuclius(sp) rna is just a replica of dna that is used to create different structures.|`|fxF2oraPaa	it takes rna (ribose nucleic acid) to make dna (deoxyribose nucleic acid); plus, rna is a strand, and dna is a double helix|`|3DxWzPUYaa	...... the  difference btw DNA n RNA is that DNA starts with a D n RNA stars with a D ?  <br>                LOL<br>    no !!!

Each nucleotide consists of a sugar, a phosphate and a nucleic acid base. The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose. The sugar in RNA is ribose, the same as deoxyribose but with one more OH (oxygen-hydrogen atom combination called a hydroxyl). This is the biggest difference between DNA and RNA. Another difference is that RNA molecules can have a much greater variety of nucleic acid bases. DNA has mostly just 4 different bases with a few extra occasionally.  The difference in these bases (between DNA and RNA) allows RNA molecules to assume a wide variety of shapes and also  many different functions. DNA, on the other hand, serves as a set of directions and that's about all (but that's absolutely necessary!). ---DrPam<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/bio99/bio99410.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/bi...</a>

2gsPuSx2aa	acidic samples have their pH values lower than the neutral point, pH=7, such as vinegar (pH=2-4), lemon juice (pH=3), stomach content (pH=1), etc. Basic substances have their pH values higher than the neutral point, such as soda lime, caustic soda, bleacher, soap solution, etc. <br>  <br>  Water's pH value changes with its ingredients; dissolved carbon dioxide makes water's pH down to 5.5, and some minerals make its pH to 7.5-8.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FWOKlNTMaa	lemons are acidid and water  is basic
WVPYem5Vaa	It is the hydrogen ion, H^+. However, this cannot exist on its own, since it is simply a proton. In most cases, the proton binds to a water molecule, forming H3O^+, also known as the hydronium ion. This is what is measured in pH readings.|`|3opisoDMaa	well, something makes somthing acidic when it has a pH of under 7, so perhaphs it's basic|`|X0e6p9Ilaa	I think you have been given some bad information.  In the Arrhenius theory an acid is defined as any substance that dissociates in water to liberate a hydrogen ion.<br>  <br>  The Bronsted-Lowry theory says basically the same thing.  It is in this theory that the idea of the "hydronium ion" is put forth, in which the hydrogen ion is hydrated by a water molecule and exists as H3O+.  <br>  <br>  We know that even the H3O+ ion is an oversimplification.  While the jury is still out, the current thinking is that a H+ is actually surrounded by four water molecules at the corners of a tetrahedron, with the H+ at the center.  This makes for a new hydronium ion with the formula H9O4^+.<br>  <br>  There is one other definition of an acid, in which an acid may not have to donate a H+.  In the Lewis theory, a base is an electron pair donor and an acid is an electron pair acceptor.  This broadens the scope of what is an acid and what is a base considerably.  The Lewis theory is of most use when dealing with many organic reactions.<br>  <br>  But practically speaking, it is the hydrogen ion, regardless of however many water molecules may surround it, that is responsible for the acidity of most acids.

No scientist knows it. But the chance for 2012 being a year without asteroid impact on Earth is very small. A 5 m asteroid hits Earth approximately every 2.4 years. 1m asteroids hit Earth about every month. <br>  <br>  The chance for a 20m asteroid, like last week, to hit Earth, is once in 72 years. <br>  <br>  So, it is not really magic to predict an asteroid impact in 2012. It is like claiming that a Dart, which you have thrown, will hit something.
YHFybwuXaa	How strong is "superstrong"? And what wavelengths are you talking about?<br>  <br>  One can try to imagine some way a star could excite a H2 medium to change the spin orientation of atoms (from up+down to up+up or down+down). The transition is the well-known 21cm band. But that state is unstable and it surely decays so you wouldn't tell that from the "natural" emission from interstellar medium.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing any plausible radio emissions wouldn't come from the star itself but rather from some cloud near/around it.

AA12329845	Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  In physics, the plasmon is the quasiparticle resulting from the quantization of plasma oscillations just as photons and phonons are quantizations of light and sound waves, respectively. Thus, plasmons are collective oscillations of the free electron gas density, often at optical frequencies. They can also couple with a photon to create a third quasiparticle called a plasma polariton.<br>  <br>  Since plasmons are the quantization of classical plasma oscillations, most of their properties can be derived directly from Maxwell's Equations.<br>  <br>  <br>  Plasmons are explained in the classical picture using the Drude model of metals. The metal is treated as a three dimensional crystal of positively charged ions, and a delocalized electron gas is moving in a periodic potential of this ion grid.<br>  <br>  Plasmons play a large role in the optical properties of metals. Light of frequency below the plasma frequency is reflected, because the electrons in the metal screen the electric field of the light. Light of frequency above the plasma frequency is transmitted, because the electrons cannot respond fast enough to screen it. In most metals, the plasma frequency is in the ultraviolet, making them shiny (reflective) in the visible range. Some metals, such as copper and gold, have electronic interband transitions in the visible range, whereby specific light energies (colors) are absorbed, yielding their distinct color. In doped semiconductors, the plasma frequency is usually in the deep ultraviolet[1]. That is why they are reflective, too.<br>  <br>  The plasmon energy can often be estimated in the free electron model as<br>  <br>  E_{p} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{n e^{2}}{m\epsilon_0}}<br>  <br>  where n is the valence electron density, e is the elementary charge, m is the electron mass and ε0 the permittivity of free space.<br>  <br>  <br>  Surface plasmons are those plasmons that are confined to surfaces and that interact strongly with light resulting in a polariton. They occur at the interface of a vacuum or material with a positive dielectric constant with that of a negative dielectric constant (usually a metal or doped dielectric). They play a role in Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and in explaining anomalies in diffraction from metal gratings (Wood's anomaly), among other things. Surface plasmon resonance is used by biochemists to study the mechanisms and kinetics of ligands binding to receptors (i.e. a substrate binding to an enzyme).<br>  <br>  More recently surface plasmons have been used to control colours of materials[1]. This is possible since controlling the material's surface shape controls the types of surface plasmons that can couple to it and propagate across it. This in turn controls the interaction of light with the surface. These effects are illustrated by the historic stained glass which adorn medieval cathedrals. In this case, the color is given by metal nanoparticles of a fixed size which interacts with the optical field to give the glass its vibrant color. In modern science, these effects have been engineered for both visible light and microwave radiation. Much research goes on first in the microwave range because at this wavelength material surfaces can be produced mechanically as the patterns tend to be of the order a few centimeters. To produce optical range surface plasmon effects involves producing surfaces which have features <400 nm. This is much more difficult and has only recently become possible to do in any reliable or available way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Possible applications<br>  <br>  Plasmons have been considered as a means of transmitting information on computer chips, since plasmons can support much higher frequencies (into the 100 THz range, while conventional wires become very lossy in the tens of GHz). Plasmons involve rapid motion of electrons through the solid, but the ohmic losses vanish. They have also been proposed as a means of high-resolution lithography and microscopy due to their extremely small wavelengths. Both of these applications have seen successful demonstrations in the lab environment. Finally, surface plasmons have the unique capacity to confine light to very small dimensions which could enable many new applications.<br>  <br>  Surface plasmons are very sensitive to the properties of the materials on which they propagate. This has led to their use to measure the thickness of monolayers on colloid films, such as screening and quantifying protein binding events. Companies such as Biacore have commercialized instruments which operate on these principles. Optical surface plasmons are being investigated with a view to improve makeup by L’Oréal among others.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon</a><br>  * <a href="http://www.plasmonicfocus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasmonicfocus.com</a><br>  * <a href="http://www.sprpages.nl" rel="nofollow">http://www.sprpages.nl</a><br>  * <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/mp/con/plasmon/sp1...." rel="nofollow">http://www.qub.ac.uk/mp/con/plasmon/sp1....</a><br>  * <a href="http://www.nano-optics.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.nano-optics.org.uk</a><br>  * Plasmonic computer chips move closer<br>  * Progress at Stanford for use in computers<br>  * Slashdot: A Plasmonic Revolution for Computer Chips?<br>  * A Microscope from Flatland Physical Review Focus|`|468c5dee5c181b1798b24ccd745a3804aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon</a><br>  <br>  cheers

For instance, the first equation can be made into 2x=36-13y so x=18-6.5y.  Plug that x into the second equation to get 13(18-6.5y)+2y=69.  Multiply this out and get 234-84.5y+2y=69.  Simplify to 234 - 82.5y = 69.  Then solve for y so -82.5y = -165 and y = 2.  Put that back into either equation (the second one seems easier).  13x + 2(2) = 69.  So 13x + 4 = 69 and then 13x = 65.

El Ni?o was blamed for severe flooding, drought, crop shortages, coral bleaching, and even the spread of the deadly hantavirus in some areas. What is El Ni?o, and how could it have such a widespread impact? <br>  <br>  El Ni?o's name, which means "Christ child" or "boy child" in Spanish, comes from the time of year it is likely to occur: around Christmas. It's not a hurricane or tropical storm, but a series of warm water currents that can have surprisingly serious effects. El Ni?o is an ocean-driven weather pattern, and it recurs every few years. It was first noticed by fishermen off the coasts of Peru and Ecuador, who observed that the warmer currents of an El Ni?o year tended to deplete fish populations. Warmer water temperatures reduce the amount of algae, which thrives in cooler temperatures. With less algae to feed on, fish populations decline. <br>  <br>  Making the connection: Water currents and weather events <br>  <br>  In 1957, Jacob Bjerknes, a scientist studying El Ni?o, discovered the connection between changing water currents and weather events such as increased rainfall. Every few years, western-flowing trade winds weaken, allowing warm waters to flow farther east. As these warm currents reach South America, moisture builds up in the atmosphere. Thunderstorms increase, causing heavy flooding and mudslides in some normally dry regions such as the desert areas of Peru. Until Bjerknes's discoveries, scientists thought that Peru was the only area affected by El Ni?o. Further research uncovered the fact that El Ni?o can cause weather changes in many parts of the globe. <br>  <br>  La Ni?a <br>  <br>  Scientists have also discovered that El Ni?o has a sibling: La Ni?a. La Ni?a means "little girl" in Spanish. Like El Ni?o, it is a recurring weather pattern, but it has the opposite effect. La Ni?a brings cooler water currents, usually increasing fish populations but also bringing colder winters to warm areas. <br>  <br>  La Ni?a and El Ni?o tend to alternate every few years, and in fact they are part of one phenomenon. In the 1920s, a scientist named Sir Gilbert Walker observed that barometric pressure readings in the Pacific showed a seesaw effect. When pressure increased in the eastern Pacific, pressure dropped in the western Pacific. As pressure changed, surface currents changed, causing either cooler or warmer waters to circulate. Scientists now refer to this seesaw effect as the El Ni?o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO.|`|cj2qiONVaa	yes

59vpcHuhaa	Gastrulation.<br>  <br>  Edit: actually gastrulation is during the embyro development. sorry :/ the same thing happens during gastrulation for an embryo.|`|YpUhEviCaa	A zygote (from Greek ζυγωτ?? zugōtos "joined" or "yoked", from ζυγο?ν zugoun "to join" or "to yoke")[1] is a cell that is the result of fertilization. That is, two haploid cells—usually an ovum from a female and a sperm cell from a male—merge into a single diploid cell called the zygote (or zygocyte). A zygote is the first cell of a new unique organism that has DNA from the mother and father.<br>  <br>  A zygote begins as a fertilized egg (ovum), and contains all of the genetic information (DNA) necessary to become a baby; half of that information is from the mother’s egg and half from the father’s sperm that has fertilized the egg. The organism in the zygote stage of life travels down the fallopian tube, while dividing to form a larger group of cells.[2] This cell division is mitotic, and is known as "cleavage".[3] All mammals go through the life stage of being in the zygote stage of life. After this life stage the organism goes through the life stages of an embryo, and a fetus. A human zygote exists for about four days, and becomes a blastocyst on the fifth day.[4]
tNnekUTIaa	cytokinesis|`|NIb8zWEHaa	cytokinesis|`|YpUhEviCaa	Cytokinesis is the process where the cytoplasm of a single eukaryotic cell is divided to form two daughter cells. It usually initiates during the late stages of mitosis, and sometimes meiosis, splitting a binucleate cell in two, to ensure that chromosome number is maintained from one generation to the next. In animal cells, one notable exception to the normal process of cytokinesis is oogenesis (the creation of an ovum in the ovarian follicle of the ovary), where the ovum takes almost all the cytoplasm and organelles, leaving very little for the resulting polar bodies, which then die. In plant cells, a dividing structure known as the cell plate forms across the centre of the cytoplasm and a new cell wall forms between the two daughter cells.<br>  <br>  Cytokinesis is distinguished from the prokaryotic process of binary fission.

Instead, we try and understand some examples of different types, and also understand why the mix of types exist.<br>  <br>  We will be interested to find out what type of stars have what type of planets, as part of the understanding of how solar systems form.  Of course, in this, we will include rocky earth-like planets in the 'goldilocks' zone, the place that's 'just right' for earth-like conditions.<br>  <br>  Who knows, maybe one day we'll find out that some of these planets do have life, but that's still a long way off.|`|4263a18069edde729fc3dc47e66f1e80aa	You need to define "Earth-like".

239bf03f74eeaad4c18a8972abf502cdaa	Sorry that's is completely incorrect, because you made an error in reasoning at the beginning. In fact well insulated means there is no heat transfer. But you cannot conclude from zero heat transfer to zero temperature change.<br>  Actually the internal energy of ideal gas is a function of temperature:<br>  U = n?Cv?T<br>  for a diatomic gas Cv = (5/2)?R<br>  If you do some compression work on the gas, internal energy rises. Hence temperature rises in this process.<br>  <br>  Zero heat transfer implies that  the gas do not exchange entropy with surrounding. Assuming furthermore reversible work, that's means no entropy is produced in the gas due to work, the entropy of the gas remains unchanged. Hence we've got an isentropic process. For such an process:<br>  p?V^γ = constant<br>   <br>  γ is the heat capacity ratio. For ideal diatomic gases:<br>  γ = Cp/Cv = (7/2)?R / (5/2)?R = 7/5 = 1.4<br>  <br>  For part a) use this relation to calculate final pressure, then use ideal gas law to calculate final temperature<br>  pi?Vi^γ = pf?Vf^γ<br>  =><br>  pf = pi ? (Vi / Vf)^γ<br>  = 1atm ? (2)^1.4<br>  = 2.639atm<br>  <br>  Ideal gas law<br>  p?V = n?R?T<br>  =><br>  p?V/T = n?R = constant<br>  =><br>  pi?Vi/Ti = pf?Vf/Tf<br>  =><br>  Tf = Ti ? (pf/pi) ? (Vf/Vi) <br>  = 293K ? (2.639) ? (1/2) <br>  = 387K<br>  <br>  For part b) you could solve the work integral.<br>  W = - ∫ p dV from Vi to Vf<br>  for this you would have to take the variation of pressure during compression process into account. (and not simply set to pf, as you did).  Actually you can derive and relation between pressure and volume from isentropic condition and integrate, but this is more complicated as it must be.<br>  <br>  I would consider the change of internal energy of the gas. As you pointed out correctly the work done on the gas is equal to the change of internal energy.<br>  W = Uf - Ui<br>  Using the expression for U from above, you find:<br>  W = (5/2)?n?R?Tf - (5/2)?n?R?Ti <br>  = (5/2)?n?R?( Tf - Ti ) <br>  <br>  You calculate the number of moles from ideal gas law<br>  n= pi?Vi/ (R?Ti)<br>  = 101325Pa ? 0.003m3 / (8.314472J/molK ? 293K)<br>  = 0.12478mol<br>  <br>  Hence:<br>  = (5/2)? 0.12478mol ? 8.314472J/molK ? (387K - 293K ) <br>  = 243.8J
QPWjtDzcaa	The decision is ultimately yours.  But one of the subjects that would give you plenty of information would actually be the planet Jupiter.  It might sound quite boring at first, just a big old planet known since ancient times, but it has a lot of information, and has provided us with a lot of information, for centuries.<br>  <br>  If you did go that route, the toughest part might be knowing what to leave out.  But in a nutshell, the things I would definitely include:<br>  <br>  Galileo (person) and his observations.<br>  Galileo (spacecraft) and it's observations<br>  Voyager I<br>  Voyager II<br>  Four large satellites (some cool things you will most certainly learn about these worlds).<br>  Calculating the speed of light???<br>  Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9<br>  Oblateness<br>  Zones, Belts, and Bands<br>  Atmosphere<br>  GRS<br>  Trojan Asteroids<br>  <br>  Not to mention all the spinoff discoveries and theories that have been attributed to the study of this giant world.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and mass, radius/diameter, orbital period, eccentricity, inclination, albeido... (all the "tale of the tape") details should probably get thrown in there as well.<br>  <br>  If you're more set on something more "out there" or "new," how about dark energy and the potential fate of the universe.  Big Rip?  Big Crunch?  Big Chill?  Heat death?  Big Bounce?  That might be too close to cosmology than physical astronomy.  So the choice is up to you.<br>  <br>  All the ones you listed would be good as well.  Some do not have as many sources for informaiton, and some are not nearly as easy to write about as there is limited information, but all are fascinating and once you get into it, it should be a great learning experience that will "wow" you as you gather the information.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  ~DLM~|`|PblD7JR5aa	The easier subjects are well covered. You can do research on projects that involve amateur - professional collaborations (variable stars, supernovae, exoplanet transit research, asteroid occultations). Or something called "cloud computing", where individuals let their home PC's work on little bits of massive projects (SETI@home, Galaxy Quest and so forth).<br>  <br>  The object with both of these concepts is that the professional community may not have the time or resources to devote to these tasks, but amateurs do. In some cases, such as asteroid occlutations, you have to go to a particular spot or area to observe the event. So its much easier for someone with portable gear to go to that site and record an event than a professional observatory (fixed site).|`|HcMVgU14aa	I would go with the search for earth like planets because the Kepler Mission just launched for that reason.

X0e6p9Ilaa	The conventional view of metals is the "electron-sea" model, in which metals are depicted as "ions" surrounded by a "sea of mobile electrons".  <br>  <br>  This model is being replaced by another in which metal atoms are covalently bonded in which the shared orbitals overlap so that electrons are free to move within the overlapping orbitals.  These electrons are referred to as "delocalized" since they are so loosely bound to any one metal atom and are free to move from atom to atom, and thus conduct electricity.<br>  <br>  This same delocalization of electrons in pi-bonding is what allows some nonmetals to conduct electricity, primarily carbon in the form of graphite.  Graphite exists in large plates of interconnected hexagonal structures.  Since the bonding in the hexagons includes delocalized pi-bonds the electrons are free to move throughout the plates allowing graphite to conduct electricity.|`|2gsPuSx2aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Electricity is basically the flow of electrons. The "conductivity" of metals and "insulation" of non-metals is best explained with the band theory, which might be quite confusing for you at this point. However, let me explain it briefly:<br>  <br>  Metals have a electron-full valence band and empty conduction band so close to each other that simple energetic stimuli like heat (thermal conduction) or electricity (electrical conduction) makes some of the electrons jump from the full valence band into empty conduction band. Non-metals have conduction and valence bands fairly apart from each other, so there is no way for the electrons to jump into the conduction band (extreme pressures might render an insulator to be a conductor, but it is practically useless).<br>  <br>  The "band" here is energy levels of HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and these are expressed as lines. Since there are many atoms, there are many lines in the form of "bands".<br>  <br>  Good luck.

qaMPEdL2aa	There is a pot that is heated by electricity.  In the pot is a slowly rotating paddle to stir the popcorn and oil mix.  The oil heats the corn and causes the water in the corn to become steam and increase the pressure inside the hull of the kernel.  The hull ruptures and the kernel explodes into popcorn.  A lid on the pot keeps the popcorn from blowing out of the pot until the volume of the popped corn has increased to the point where it lifts the lid.  Then the weight of the popped corn keeps the rest of the corn from flying out but just pushes the earliest popped kernels out as more of the corn is popped.

If you live in a suburban area, you won't see it.<br>  <br>  The zodiacal light is generally dimmer than the Milky Way.

It's often described as triangular in shape, but it's a long and thin triangle, angled to the south in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.  The tip of the triangle usually fades into nothing.  However, under especially dark skies, the zodiacal light extends into a very faint band crossing the sky along the ecliptic (the zodiacal band).

Start with a basis for U intersect W:  {v1, .... , vn}.   These n vectors are a linearly independent set that spans part of U, so you can augment them with a set of additional vectors {u1, ..., uk} so that {v1, .... vn, u1, ...., uk} is a basis for U.  Likewise, you can find vectors {w1, ...., wj} such that {v1, ....., vn, w1, ....., wj} is a basis for W.<br>  And if you put all the v, w, and u vectors together you've got a basis for U+W.<br>  <br>  Now look at what you've got, how many vectors are in the basis of each subspace, and the dimension formula follows immediately.

Most people have jobs and than they have money to spend, they utterly need transportation and more comforts. This are implied to usage of petroleum in USA. The total number of Automobils in USA in year 2006 was 250,851,833. Around 90% of Americans drove to work in cars give us a clear picture of high usage of petroleum . This was about only one product of petroleum , if one looks at the range of petroleum products and its significance in US economy you will be overwhelmed. Plastics , chemical, pharmaceutical, pesticides and so many othe industries have dependencies on petroleum products.<br>  As far as depletion of petroleum is concerns, experts are predicting the 50 years from now  natural petroleum source will deplete. Various countries/ companies are exploring different location rich in petroleum like north pole and south pole. As far a US is concerned about petroleum supplies their is no doubt that their is a vast source of petroleum is hidden unexplored in soils of US.

AA12329845	Sci-Tech Encyclopedia: Rift valley  <br>  Top Home > Library > Science > Sci-Tech Encyclopedia<br>  <br>  One of the geomorphological expressions between two tectonic plates that are opening relative to each other or sliding past each other. The term originally was used to describe the central graben structures of such classic continental rift zones as the Rhinegraben and the East African Rift, but the definition now encompasses mid-oceanic ridge systems with central valleys such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. See also Mid-Oceanic Ridge; Plate tectonics.<br>  <br>  Continental and oceanic rift valleys are end members in what many consider to be an evolutionary continuum. In the case of continental rift valleys, plate separation is incomplete, and the orientation of the stress field relative to the rift valley can range from nearly orthogonal to subparallel. Strongly oblique relationships are probably the norm. In contrast, oceanic rift valleys mark the place where the trailing edges of two distinctly different plates are separating. The separation is complete, and the spreading is organized and focused, resulting in rift valleys that tend to be oriented orthogonal or suborthogonal to the spreading directions.<br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/rift-valley" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/rift-valley</a>|`|vzRwazI0aa	look it up much?<br>  google, duh.<br>  (:|`|AA12324658	The Great Rift valley is where the first suspected hominids were found<br>  <br>  AKA were the first "cavemen" were found

z7BiMSWmaa	Episomes<br>  An episome is a portion of genetic material that can exist independent of the main body of genetic material (called the chromosome) at some times, while at other times is able to integrate into the chromosome.<br>  <br>  Examples of episomes include insertion sequences and transposons. Viruses are another example of an episome. Viruses that integrate their genetic material into the host chromosome enable the viral nucleic acid to be produced along with the host genetic material in a nondestructive manner. As an autonomous unit (i.e., existing outside of the chromosome) however, the viral episome destroys the host cell as it commandeers the host's replication apparatuses to make new copies of itself.<br>  <br>  Another example of an episome is called the F factor. The F factor determines whether genetic material in the chromosome of one organism is transferred into another organism. The F factor can exist in three states that are designated as FPLUS, Hfr, and F prime.<br>  <br>  FPLUS refers to the F factor that exists independently of the chromosome. Hfr stands for high frequency of recombination, and refers to a factor that has integrated into the host chromosome. The F prime factor exists outside the chromosome, but has a portion of chromosomal DNA attached to it.<br>  <br>  An episome is distinguished from other pieces of DNA that are independent of the chromosome (i.e.,plasmids) by their large size.<br>  <br>  Plasmids are different from episomes, as plasmid DNA cannot link up with chromosomal DNA. The plasmid carries all the information necessary for its independent replication. While not necessary for bacterial survival, plasmids can be advantageous to a bacterium.

A study conducted by LifeStyles Condoms found an average of 14.9 cm (5.9 in) with a standard deviation of 2.1 cm (0.8 in) (measured by staff).  The Cancún LifeStyle study found an average of 12.6 cm (5.0 in) with a standard deviation of 1.3 cm (0.5 in).  Similar results exist regarding studies of the circumference of the adult fully erect penis, with the measurement taken mid-shaft.  As with length, studies that relied on self-measurement consistently reported a higher average than those with staff measuring.<br>  <br>  One study found the mean flaccid penis length to be 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) (measured by staff).  Length of the flaccid penis does not necessarily correspond to length of the erect penis; some smaller flaccid penises can grow much larger, and some larger flaccid penises cannot grow much larger.

God probably created a preview universe, like a blueprint for what he will do. Then when he finished his "blueprints" he put it into action in one big pulse (the big bang). The pulse used energy, which was released. The gathered energy bunched into blah, particles, bacteria, then molecules. Then the (insert reeeeeally big number) molecules bunched and created stars, planets, everything non-living. Then as said in the Bible, God made living things.<br>  <br>  This is just my theory.

jlf1sSrGaa	"...1. Is new space (or existence) actually be created, or is preexisting space simply expanding?..."<br>  <br>  No one can say for sure, but the prevailing thought is that instead of "new" space being created it's existing space that's expanding, as it has been since the instant of the Big Bang<br>  <br>  <br>  "...1. Is everything in the universe expanding in every direction at the same time? Meaning, am I miles larger than I was a few seconds ago?..."<br>  <br>  No, everything in the universe is not moving away from everything else. You have to think in terms of "close" and "far."  For example,  galaxies that are close enough to each other interact gravitationally. Our Milky Way belongs to a cluster of galaxies known as the Local Group in which several galaxies orbit around a common center of mass; they do not move away from each other due to the expansion of space. On the other hand, galaxies that are separated from us by hundreds of millions of light years are not influenced by their mutual gravity and are subject to the expansion of space. As for our bodies, they are bound tightly by the nuclear forces of atoms, easily overcoming the expansion of space.

h6GEvhBqaa	First of all, a vector tells you two things: magnitude and direction. Magnitude answers "how much" and direction asks "at what angle" For example, velocity is a vector. You could say my velocity is 30 mph (magnitude) Southwest (direction). With that in mind....<br>  <br>  To find the magnitude of a vector simply place it at the origin. The endpoint of the vector would then be (-3,-2). To find the distance (magnitude) of this vector, just use distance formula, or sqrt ( 3^2 + 2^2) = sqrt (13)<br>  <br>  cu is what is called a scalar multiple. It doesn't change the direction, it just makes the magnitude different. for example using a c of 2 and the velocity example, you'd be going 60mph southwest. So, just multiply each coordinate (-9, -6) by 3 to get that. It makes it 3 times bigger (the magnitude)<br>  <br>  a unit vector is a vector with magnitude 1. a simple formula to remember is a unit vector in the direction of you can be found by dividing each coordinate of u by ll u ll. so, (-3/sqrt(13), -2/sqrt(13))<br>  <br>  Try the last one with this information!|`|1e8f9a70b81ba191472efb5cd4e71038aa	Vector u = - 3 i - 2 j<br>  I u I = √(9 + 4)<br>  I u I = √13<br>  <br>  cu = - 9 i - 6 j

It will be 365 +365 +365 + 366. That will be equal to 1461 days in four years, including the leap year. Divide 287,775 by that, which is 196 and some left over. So, you have 196 blocks of four years, which translates into 784 years. Then, you need to take the remainder from 287,775. That is equal to 287775 - (1461 * 196), which is equal to 1419 days. Therefore, you can fit only three more years into those 1419 remaining days. You answer will then be 784 + 3 = 787 years with some days left over.. <br>  <br>  If you are doing 365 years, don't count leap, then 287775 / 365 = 788 full years with some days left over.|`|rI7lfuN9aa	287775/365=788.424657 years<br>  787.885010 if you consider Leap Years, as follows: 287775/365.25=787.885010 years|`|yZUQToOdaa	How many years in 287,775 days?<br>   <br>  Answer: 788.42465 years|`|uhTMdZeVaa	787.88501

y0MnsQRNaa	Thorium, as well as uranium, can be used as a nuclear fuel. Although not fissile itself, Th-232 will absorb slow neutrons to produce uranium-233 (U-233)a, which is fissile (and long-lived). The irradiated fuel can then be unloaded from the reactor, the U-233 separated from the thorium, and fed back into another reactor as part of a closed fuel cycle.<br>  <br>  In one significant respect U-233 is better than uranium-235 and plutonium-239, because of its higher neutron yield per neutron absorbed. Given a start with some other fissile material (U-233, U-235 or Pu-239), a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient than that with U-238 and plutonium (in normal, slow neutron reactors) can be set up.  <br>  Thorium, Plutonium and mixed fuel are possible with technology available today, who knows what the future will bring..|`|tIDNEwdMaa	Mixed Oxide.

vSkqJ813aa	Within simple Newtonian mechanics a mutual gravitational force of attraction by a massive body 'M' upon an object 'm', gives rise to a force of acceleration (from Newton's second law of motion F = ma or here F = mg): -<br>  <br>  F = - GmM<br>  ........ ___<br>  .......... r2<br>  <br>  (The negative sign is a convention - meaning attraction towards a common centre)<br>  <br>  This, force of gravitational attraction is that of a conservative central force whose potential V(r) is such that: -<br>  <br>  F = -dV(r)<br>  ...... ____<br>  ....... dr<br>  <br>  <br>  Thus, as an object and a large mass mutually accelerate towards each other, gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy for both objects. However, a very large mass, such as a planet, has a substantial inertia or resistance to motion change (from Newton’s first law of motion) and therefore does not move as the object accelerates into it. <br>  <br>  The gravitational potential energy for an object of mass ‘m’ and height ‘h’ above a massive body is: -<br>  <br>  V(r) = mgh<br>  <br>  This potential energy converts into kinetic energy, given by: -<br>  <br>  E = ?mv2<br>  <br>  This energy conversion may be expressed by a conservation of energy equation: -<br>  <br>  ?mv2 = mgh<br>  <br>  <br>  Thus, energy is conserved within a 'central conservative force field' and all of the potential gravitational energy is converted into kinetic energy as an object accelerates towards a massive object under mutual gravitational attraction. Hence, gravitational attraction does NOT ADD ANY EXTRA ENERGY!<br>  <br>  NASA use gravitational 'sling shot' effects to boost the velocity of their inter-planetary probes by converting gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. <br>  <br>   <br>  Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GRT) provides a Newtonian approximation to the gravitational potential energy so that: -<br>  <br>  V(r) = - (K/c2).∫(ρ/r).dτ<br>  <br>  The unit of time is 'τ' and Newton's constant G = K. Again, within Einstein's theory - potential energy is conserved and converted into kinetic energy under gravitational attraction. Einstein also placed a limit on the velocity that an object may attain under gravitational acceleration - too that of less than the speed of light in a vacuum.<br>   <br>  A more detailed second order version of GRT allows the consideration of massive gravitating potential well such as black holes! If the intense gravity of a black hole object captures 'gas' it will accelerate the gas in a spiralling inward orbit until the ripped apart particles of the gas attain close to the speed of light velocities before crossing the event horizon.<br>  However, this is just part of the picture where an intense gravitational field is concerned. An object or particle spiralling into a Black hole loses energy through gravitational radiation. As it reaches its last stable orbit, it falls rapidly into the Black hole and emits a last gasp burst of gravitational waves. The total energy radiated during the slow inward spiral is equal to the binding energy of the last stable orbit: -<br>  <br>  E(radiated) = μ - E(last orbit)<br>  <br>  Where 'μ' is the rest mass of the object or particle. It may be shown that for a Schwarzschild hole this has a value of 0.0573V and for a Kerr hole 0.4235μ. The total energy of the last gasp burst is about 0.01μ(μ/M) if μ<<M. <br>  <br>  Certainly, a black hole could be used to create a very high velocity for a spacecraft using a ‘gravitational sling shot’ effect. However, the Special Theory of Relativity  does not allow massive objects to attain the speed of light and, furthermore, such an attempt would be a ‘smidgen’ risky!!!!!!!!|`|0gR9MM2Xaa	No additional energy,just a change from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy.For a material body to reach the speed of light INFINITE energy would be needed and so it is therefor impossible.The centre of the earth is molten at more than 4000deg,K and most of this heat energy came from the fall of all the tiny and large meteorites falling from thousands even millions of miles out in cold space into the growing planet earth.When they hit earth the kinetic energy was transformed into heat energy: and is still there causing volcanoes and the drift of continents today.Shooting stars show that space dust is still falling into earth at many thousands of miles per hour,when they reach our atmosphere they are slowed down by rubbing against the air and change their kinetic energy into heat energy so that they shine like stars(shooting stars).Material falling throuh the earths air can only reach speeds of up to about 200 miles per hour ,human bodies no more thanabout 120 mph because of their need to push the air out of the way.|`|OatLZ0sXaa	Gravity is energy too.But way is ellipse.So by gravity no but by chellinging gravity feild can reach star in 2 to 6 ch namly more directly way (no crooked).For gravity line is no line.|`|8mFvaWeBaa	Gravitational potential energy. The gravity 10 N will force the object to accelerate, and if the mass is greater, it will pick up more drag faster.|`|AA11539543	There is no additional energy ?<br>  <br>  I think the ultimate speed something can reach using just gravity is 120mph in free fall though i might be wrong but i'm sure i read somewhere that is the max speed a falling person could reach regardless of from what height they fell ?|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	1) From gravitational potential energy--or to use a field point of view--from the gravitational field itself.<br>  2) A limit to what?  Speed?<br>  3) Gravitational slings can certainly be helpful in accelerating interplanetary probes.  I don't know about using one to achieve light speed--that would take infinite energy, and the fields apparently don't contain infinite energy.<br>  <br>  High energy gravity problems are difficult to answer because all the working field theories have non-renormalizable infinities (which we don't observe).  GR is the low energy limit of our effective field theories, but there's no reason to trust it at sufficiently high energies.|`|jY0ZxcLcaa	If you arrive from space the question is relevant. Then your body is given kinetic energy from the gravitational field. But as you hit the surface in your brutal way, you give the energy back.<br>  <br>  But it ie more understandable for us living on this this loved erath.<br>  <br>  We need to use enegy to get our elevators lifting us. But if we jump out of the window, we will have kinetic energy hitting the grond equal to that used in the elevator. I estimate no loss of energy in the elevator or to the air caused by by its resistance.

IGyQohy9aa	A hydraulic press delivers a big force. By using a high pressure on a big piston you can achieve a high force. However you can generate the high pressure with a small force although the small force has to travel a long way to generate the high pressure in the big cylinder.<br>  <br>  i.e. you have a multiplier effect. <br>  <br>  Another advantage (over a mechanical system such as a lever) is that the pressure can be obtained from a distance away by using pipes or hoses to transfer the pressure to the piston. When the force is no longer required the hydraulic fluid returns to a reservoir for re-use (unlike in pneumatic systems where the air is usually lost).<br>  <br>  Another advantage of hydraulics over pneumatics is that if there is an explosion at high pressure with hydraulics you will only get a jet of oil but with pneumatics the explosion can be catastrophic.

YHFybwuXaa	The FT of a function f(t) can be written as a sum of a sine series (the cosines are just sines with argument phased by pi/2).

This is a 2-dimensional function (width and height). <br>  The FT of a picture (imagine pure black and white for now, no grays or colors) describes how much of "big objects/blobs" appear in the picture (low end of the spectrum), how much of "medium objects" appear (about the middle of the spectrum) and so on.

9lzNDwhZaa	Inarticulata open and close their valves with muscles and do not rely on sockets and teeth that are a characteristic of articulate brachiopods. They have 12 such muscles. Devonian species of this class are often found attached to other organisms -- such as another brachiopod shell or horn coral. The bottom ventral valve may be cemented to a firm surface, while the upper dorsal valve is opened for feeding. Inarticulata are typically composed of calcium phosphate shells. Articulata are MUCH MORE common than Inarticulata.<br>  <br>  Articulata have two valves that are of different size. The larger shell is called the pedicle valve. It contains a hole through which a fleshy stalk called a pedicle attaches to a substrate (rocks or sediment on the sea floor). The pedicle acts as an anchor which firmly holds the brachiopod in place. The pedicle valve contains projections called teeth that fit into sockets on the opposite brachial valve. Articulata are always composed of calcium carbonate shells.|`|25VvTwKaaa	When looking at the fossils, look at the hingeline between the two valves.  Articulate brachiopods will have a definite hinge line connecting them.<br>    <br>  Orthida, Strophomenida, Pentamerida, Rhynchonellida, Spiriferida, Terebratulida are all from the class Articulata.  If you can identify any of the Brachiopods as these you can place them in Articulata.

That's basically how you cook in a microwave oven.<br>  <br>  Radio waves basically just go right through.<br>  <br>  X rays and gamma rays are nasty. You can get a lot of Compton collisions where it deposits energy by ripping electrons (X-rays) off of atoms, or inducing nuclear transitions (gamma rays) such as transmutations: there's surely some gamma reactions where you change a carbon nucleus into a nitrogen isotope.

GyunhYKzaa	Myelination of the axon and increased axon diameter. As for the second part, think about a garden hose. Suppose the hose has a series of holes in it that allow water (or in this case electric current) to leak out. If the hose is insulated with tape to block the holes, this decreases the amount of water that is lost and results in increased water flow out through the nozzle. Suppose you didn't have any tape but had two hoses, a thin hose with 50 holes or a thick hose with 50 holes and had a limited amount of time to fill up a bucket. It would make sense to use the larger hose because it will be able to accommodate a greater flow of water. <br>  <br>  I'll leave the limitations part up to you.|`|PJPxulGJaa	Here's MY comment - do your OWN research!

It can not be contained by anything man-made because it grows to millions of degrees. But even if you could, it would be unstable, meltdowns would be way worse than a fission reactor, it would be like having an atomic bomb waiting to go off on the edge of your town. Then you have the fear of radiation and the mutations and cancer that goes with it, as well as destroying the environment. The end result would also be that we probably would not get that much more energy from it than what we do now (which is about 7% of humanity's energy consumption).|`|coRvefiYaa	Actually, if it is ever possible, nuclear fusion would be a very clean energy source without any chance of it blowing up like a nuclear bomb. The thing with fusion is that no nuclear byproducts are produced like fission.<br>  <br>  The downsides right now are that it hasn't been developed yet for energy (outside of setting off a fission bomb to get the atoms hot enough to fuse, which is why we have fusion bombs). There is a lot of work going on to try and get fusion technology going but its very expensive and will require quite a bit of energy to get atoms to fuse. <br>  <br>  When they do get it to work, they state that the world's energy needs will be solved.

S8H5yYcoaa	Notice that I[x] is the subset of R[x] whose coefficients have values in I.  This set is an ideal if it is closed under addition within itself and multiplication by anything in R[x]:<br>  For polynomials a(x) = a_0 + a_1*x + a_2*x^2 + ... + a_n*x^n and b(x) = b_0 + b_1*x + ... + b_m*x^m, consider a(x) + b(x):<br>  a_0 + a_1*x +  ... + a_n*x^n + b_0 + b_1*x + ... + b_m*x^m =<br>  (a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1)x + (a_2 + b_2)x^2 + ... (goes in this manner up to the min of n, m, after which is is simply the leftover terms from a or b).  Note that if n and m are not equal, any term with subscript greater than their min has coefficient automatically in I, by placement of a and b.  For subscripts between 0 and this min, each coefficient is the sum of terms in I, which is an ideal and so closed under addition, and so these coefficients are also in I - then (a+b)(x) is in I[x], which is therefore closed under addition.<br>  For a(x) in I[x] and f(x) = f_0 + f_1*x + ... + f_m*x^m in R[x], consider a(x)f(x):<br>  (a_0 + a_1*x + a_2*x^2 + ... + a_n*x^n)(f_0 + f_1*x + ... + f_m*x^m) =<br>  a_0*f_0 + (a_0f_1 + a_1f_0)x + ... (the important part here is that everything ends up being sums of products of elements in the ideal with elements in the ring - I'll let you work out the fiddly bits of the coefficients here, as it's easy but tedious).<br>  So each coefficient is a sum, of which each piece is a coefficient of a times a coefficient of f - an element of I times an element of R, in I by the definition of ideal, and so as ideals are closed under addition each coefficient is in I - then (af)(x) is in I[x].<br>  <br>  I[x] is closed under addition within itself and multiplication from the whole ring R[x], and so is an ideal.

I used to live in a small Ukrainian town by the river and mountains.Both of  us were pretty independent for our age so my parents would let us go almost anywhere alone.On this summer day my friends and I decided to go camping by the river.It was about 3 kilometers(1.8 miles) away from our houses so none of our parents let us go alone that time. We lied to our parents and told them that there is an adult going with us. Some of us set up  tents others started a fire for BBQ.<br>  We ate  we played some card games and went to sleep.In the middle of the nigh my brother and I went to take a piss. There was starnge hole (3ft radius ) so we decided to piss inside it when heard a strange noise. It sounded like an evil dolphin so both of started running like crazy with open zippers pissing on our pants. We were scared but curious so I grabbed a flash light and went back to that hole. Both of us were stunned when we saw some wierd creature ( looked like a hybrid of murmaid and mondfish ) eating something. The creature was about 3 feet long it had hands  and smelled like sh!t.To bad it disapear as soon as rest of our friends came to see it. Our freinds still believed us because water inside that hole was red and it still smelled really bad. One of my friends thought that a humans wes eaten and  its  a grave now. We brought few showels from home and for the next 3 hours we were filling that hole with soil. We put a lot of soil inside but it seemed to disapear so we figured that the hole is way to deep for us to fill it. We told this story to our parents but they thougt we were lying.<br>  Our parents were not the only people who heard the story. We told it to other kids and it spread.

OcfUTWataa	Type was small to put more words on each page and fewer pages in the book.  This held down the price of the book.  Before the 1970s people were more careful about spending money and would not pay the equivalent of $20- $25 for a book. So small type helped keep the price down so that a price could be charged that people would pay to buy a book. <br>  Paperbacks were originally invented for the same purpose - to make books affordable so that more people could afford them.|`|AA11826768	Most printers then were small operations that could not afford more then one set of type face.

5EIrFbHkaa	Because of their harmonic movements and their influence across each other.<br>  The Sun rotates and produces certain magnetic and gravitational attraction. Each planet who "falls" in the orbits of the Sun will start their movement according with their own projected trajectory and will stabilize their orbit accommodating his speed with this distance around the Sun.<br>  When other object "falls" in the orbit of the Sun, the same occurs, but with the influence of the other object already in orbit, which can collide until they can find their harmonic movement, and their influence about each other (and in the Sun - like the tides) is high enough to make they turn in the same direction after a big period of time.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	How do you know they aren't going up and down?

If you looked at the plane from another direction, it would look like they were going up and down instead of horizontally.  It's all a matter of perspective.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	You may be confused about the idea of spin. If an object is spinning, there is a direction, "the axis", at right angles to the direction of the spin.  The direction that the whole planet moves around the sun is independent of the spin axis.  One of the planets has its spin almost parallel the direction of motion. The earth's axis is about 27degrees tipped from true right angle to its orbit direction. That is why we have the seasons.<br>  <br>  There is a basic law of Physics called "Conservation of Angular Momentum" which is a little complicated to explain here.<br>  It is the way the Universe is.<br>  <br>  Also the whole solar system, sun and planets, are thought to have been condensed from swirling gas.  the spin of that gas was conserved in to the spin of the sun and the planets.|`|xDPQ700baa	Depends which way you look at it.......

Pluto actually comes in closer than Neptune every few hundred years.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	IF all the planets in a system were formed from the spinning gas/matter cloud that formed the star then Conservation of Angular momentum and the dynamics of collisions in space cause the planets to from in the same horizontal plane as the spin of the sun.

Planets that are very distant from a star will be separated by great distances, however, and will not influence each other much - so they can and do exist at large angles to the ecliptic.<br>  <br>  Planets close to a star ( out to Neptune in our case) tug on each other with gravity since they are closer together than the far away thingies and they tend to line up for that reason.<br>  <br>  They also are thought to be lined up because the solar disk from which the solar system formed is thought to have been flat like  a disc.   If so,  the gravity tug of war between the closer worlds will tend to also keep them within the original disc configuration|`|yaq7oaH6aa	If you mean do planets orbit a star in orbits with very different planes, the answer is "not for long as cosmic events go.<br>  Such an arrangement would be unstable over time, and unlikely to occur as planets as a rule condense from from one spinning disk of diffuse <br>  matter that would have a single plane.of rotation.<br>  a captured object might orbit in a different plane, but interaction with other objects would tend to disturb that orbit.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Not likely, since planets are thought to form from the same rotating disk of material (sort of like a pizza - a flat shape, not a ball).|`|yZUQToOdaa	Yes, planets' axis' can be horizontal and vertical.

UFteXlqwaa	Well, for fog to appear, you need those conditions:<br>  <br>  1) An inversion. That is: warmer air aloft and colder near the ground. That way, the air is not rising and the fog is not lifting.<br>  2) Humid air at the ground that cools down, goes under the dew point temperature and condense into droplets of water.<br>  <br>  That happens when you have a high pressure; a place where air sinks and warms up aloft by adiabatic effect (compression of a gas creates heat).<br>  <br>  Then the surface must cool down. That happens often at night with a clear sky and the radiation of the heat toward the sky. The problem for your scenario is that ... the sky is overcast.<br>  <br>  The large river is certainly a good source of moisture. You have certainly seen that early morning fog appears often over lakes and wide rivers.<br>  <br>  A plausible scenario is that the air cools down at night not by radiation but by katabatic effect. That happens in valleys, during a windless night, when the cold air falls down from the mountains into the valleys. Rivers being often at the bottom of a valley, it could fit your scenario.<br>  <br>  Katabatic winds are often weak but in special conditions, they can be quite strong. For example there is stories of Inuit villages in the fjords of Greenland being destroyed by the cold air from the central glacier, falling down the deep fjords in gale force gusts.

It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage? <br>  <br>  ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.<br>  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years.

The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.<br>  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.<br>  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes. <br>  ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.<br>  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.<br>  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.<br>  <br>  Each time the end the world is predicted.

9Xur3g9Paa	NEGATIVE.  If you are taking a normal dose (not drinking the bottle) the amount of alcohol in the strongest cough syrups is about 40% v/v so one tablespoon would only contain about 1/2 an ounce.  A standard drink contains 1.5 ounces, so you are talking about 1/3 of a drink.  Second, the very small volume (remember this 1/2 ounces is not in a mixer) will spend more time in the stomach where gastric alcohol dehydrogenase will metabolize it.  Also, the formulation of cough syrups is such that is sticks to your throat and very slowly makes it way to your stomach.  Third, whatever alcohol in the stomach that was not metabolized would be subject to significant first pass metabolism as it went from the intestines to the hepatic portant vein and directly to the liver.  Fourth, it is standard operating procedure to any breathtesting instrument user to observe the subject for 20 minutes before taking a sample.  Therefore, any residual mouth alcohol (from drinking or from cough syrum) will be completely eliminated.  This time allows more metabolism in the liver of any alcohol that made it into your circulation.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line: therapeutic use of a cough medicine that contains (even a large amount) of alcohol will not present any problem for breath alcohol testing.  In addition, there would be no reason for you to be required to take a breath alcohol test without "probable cause" to arrest you (e.g., bad driving, you appeared intoxicated, admitted to drinking, odor of alcohol on your breath).|`|AA12327015	If that cough syrup has alcohol in it, yes it will.

Tiph3lQcaa	The best store to buy a telescope from varies based on your location. You should try to find a local dealer that has a good reputation in amateur astronomy. Look under telescopes and hobbies. Even better, contact your local amateur astronomy club. They will know who has a good record based on integrity and service. That's who you should go to. Do not buy from a department store like Wal-mart or a resale site like Ebay, since the suppliers know nothing about astronomy and will not be able to help you when you need it (we all need help on occasion). On-line suppliers of new equipment like Orion are OK, but they are not as good as finding a reliable local source.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	Believe it or not, for less than $200 you can get a fairly nice amateur telescope at Wal-Mart.|`|1i6aF5Tdaa	Get a 8" Dobsonian.

So unfortunately, you still have two options. If you use the water, the salt will dissolve, and it'll be extremely hard to measure the displacement, since the salt breaks-down. <br>  <br>  Oil, on the other hand, is more dense, so the salt would most likely float on top of it, allowing you to measure displacement easier.

It may be so big that we only see a small part of the "curve".|`|jSPj3S6faa	Currently, the universe is considered to be flat as perceived in the fourth spatial dimension.  The curvature of our universe in the fourth spatial dimension would not be readily apparent to us three-dimensional beings unless it were very extreme.<br>  <br>  As stated at first, it is the current opinion of science that our universe is flat in the fourth spatial dimension according to measurements taken within our visible universe at great distances.  I qualify this opinion because things can change as our ability to measure (observe) things in the universe increases.<br>  <br>  For instance, since it was discovered that the universe is expanding, measurements made seem to confirm that the rate of expansion was slowing.  Within the last decade, better (more precise) measurements have been made which revel instead that the rate of expansion is increasing.<br>  <br>  To return to the question of how our universe is flat, science is taking the stand that our universe is not curved positively; that is, if it were curved positively, by traveling in a perfect straight line for a long enough distance, we would end up where we started and headed in the original direction.<br>  <br>  More bizarrely would be the other possibility that our universe is curved negatively in the fourth spatial dimension.  To imagine a negative curve (because it cannot be drawn in a manner comprehensible), you need to consider the effect of a negative curve.<br>  <br>  In order to understand the effect of a negative curve, you must understand the effect of a positive curve, which, fortunately, is quite easy.  If you imagine two points on a paper and connect them with a straight line, that line is a certain length.  If you instead connect them with a (positively) curved line, the length of that curved line is longer.  Now comes the crazy part: we then connect the two points with a negatively curved line (in theory because we cannot draw it), the length of that line would be less than the straight line.<br>  <br>  There does exist math that deals with this craziness and it has been applied to observations made within our visible universe; the conclusion is that our three-dimensional universe is flat in the fourth dimension.<br>  <br>  It is my personal opinion that the universe does feature a negative curvature... that is very slight... very, very slight.|`|i1jV0xIGaa	Flat means that euclidean geometry would hold in the Universe - everywhere. For example, a triangle formed from 3 points in space would have three angles that sum to exactly 180 degrees.  Einstein said that the Universe is close to being flat, but is actually gaussian.  Space in the vicinity of the sun, for example is slightly warped, so that light passing the sun is deflected slightly from its course.  Light is massless and is not influenced by gravity, per se, but it must follow any curves in space as it moves. To do otherwise would be to exit the universe which is not allowed or defined.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	OK, OK, I know I should watch this week's episode of "The Universe" before answering this question. Saying that the Universe is flat does not mean it 2 dimensional. The debate was whether the universe is flat or curved like a space-time parabola or hyperbola.

GASTNilgaa	It helps to know what some call "the parallelogram law," which says that<br>  <br>  2a^2 + 2b^2 = c^2 + d^2<br>  <br>  With a = 15, c = 25, and d = 20 I get c^2 + d^2 = 1025 and 2a^2 = 2(225) = 450 so that<br>  <br>  2b^2 = 1025 - 450 = 575 so that b = sqrt(575/2).  Since 575 = 25*23 you could rewrite b as 5 sqrt(23/2) but I can't think of anything nicer than that.  Either I've made some silly mistake, or the numbers in this problem weren't engineered to turn out nice.  Once you've got b, applying the law of cosines should be no problem.

On the left side you will get 3(x+1) +3(x-1)=4(x+1)(x-1).  Simplify and you should then get 4x^2-6x-4=0.  Next factor out a 2, and should now have 2x^2-3x-2=0.  Now, factor this equation.  When you factor it you get 2(2x+1)(x-2)=0.  Then set all of them equal to 0 and you will get x=0, x=-1, and x=2.
RRFiy9CAaa	128-bit refers to the length of the key in bits. As you might imagine, the longer the key, the harder it should be to break the encryption, at least by brute-force testing of keys, hence the use of the term "strength" in conjunction with 128-bit. If you have 128 key bits, then there are 2^128 possible keys to try in a brute-force attack on the cipher. 64-bit-keyed block ciphers such as the long-lived Data Encryption Standard (DES) used to be considered quite secure, until advances in computing technology and cryptanalysis mandated a move to greater key-sizes (as well as encryption-block sizes). Now 128-bit keys seem standard, with many ciphers providing options to incorporate even more key bits.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in cryptography in general the standard introductory text to the field is Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography.

kjml1apoaa	Atomic number of elements is known as the proton number. It states how many protons you have and since atoms are of neutral charge and are not in their ion forms you can determine the number of electrons you have in that atom. Atomic number is represented by Z and you can find the atomic mass with the formula A= Z+N where A=atomic mass and N= number of neutrons. Hope that helps!|`|KJHw0oI3aa	The atomic number is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.  The nucleus also contains neutrons.  The number of neutrons could be the same as the number of protons, but not necessarily so.  Sometimes the number of neutrons is greater and sometimes smaller than the number of protons.  Protons are positive particles.  Since atoms are neither positive nor negative, every atom must also have negative particles called electrons equal in number to the number of protons.  Electrons are outside the nucleus forming a cloud around it.|`|f8gt7egjaa	atomic number ussually suggests u the no of protons, neutrons and electrons in an atom(in lower atomic numbers). However, for higher atomic number it is not easy to estimate the no. of neutrons in an atom.the amount of neutrons is also varied in Isotopes.  Also, in an ionized atom the number of that specific atom's electrons can be varied. For this reason, atomic number is defined as the number of proton in an atom. In this case atomic no. is only 9 (means relatively small atomic number), and if the atom is not ionized(neutral atom) or not charged, then it has 9 protons , 9 electrons and 10 electrons (may seem to be 9 neutrons, but that isotope is unstable and ignore other isotopes to make the model). The atom with atomic number 9 is Fluorine. <br>  <br>    If you like to know more about that just go to this website  <br>          click this link                                        <a href="http://www.chemicalelements.com/elements/f.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chemicalelements.com/elements...</a><br>     Gud luck|`|8j182CvKaa	I think you might be confusing atomic number and atomic mass (also called atomic weight).<br>  <br>  Atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom. It tells you which element the atom is. In this case, if there are 9 protons it is a fluorine atom. Orbiting the nucleus, there are also 9 negatively charged electrons which cancel out the positive charges on the protons.<br>  <br>  All atoms (apart from hydrogen atoms) also contain neutrons in the nucleus. A normal fluorine atom contains 10 neutrons in the nucleus so there are 19 particles in total in the nucleus - 9 protons and 10 neutrons. The total number of particles in the nucleus is called the atomic mass or atomic weight, so for Fluorine it is 19. Fluorine atoms can be made in the laboratory with anything from 8 to 14 neutrons in the nucleus. These are called isotopes of fluorine - the atomic number is always 9, but the atomic weight can vary from 17 to 23. However, all the isotopes except for the one with 10 neutrons (fluorine-19) are radioactive, which means they break down very quickly to other, stable elements.<br>  <br>  If your teacher meant the atom has an atomic weight of 9, then this means there are a total of 9 particles (protons plus neutrons) in the nucleus, but it doesn't tell you how many of each. It could be lithium-9, with 3 protons and 6 neutrons, or boron-9 with 5 protons and 4 neutrons, or even carbon-9 with 6 protons and 3 neutrons - but all of these are unstable, radioactive isotopes which don't exist in nature. The only stable isotope with atomic weight of 9 is beryllium with 4 protons and 5 neutrons, and of course it has 4 electons orbiting the nucleus.<br>  <br>  So if your teacher meant atomic number 9, it is a fluorine atom with nine protons and ten neutons in the nucleus, and nine electrons orbiting the nucleus. But if the teacher meant atomic weight 9 it is probably a beryllium atom with four protons and five neutrons in the nucleus, and four electrons orbiting the nucleus.

J3TGyOnDaa	No, the world is not going to end in 2012. It's already changing culturally and spiritually, and I doubt that that will end in 2012. Scientific paradigm changes take many years to spread, and then people get lazy and assume that a paradigm is correct, even when there is increasing evidence that it is not correct (type 1 diabetes mellitus is a life-time auto-immune disease). Cultural shifts take a decade or more to fully take effect.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is real. It does not end, because it is circular<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=aztec+..." rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?q=aztec+...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.azteccalendar.com/azteccalend..." rel="nofollow">http://www.azteccalendar.com/azteccalend...</a><br>  <br>  The Aztecs conquered the Mayans and absorbed the Mayan culture. There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Trinage of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	No, the world is not going to end in 2012.

JPYFTgrEaa	I used to have a Brown Anole myself as well! Her name was Pepsi and her most favorite things in the world to eat were both crickets and meal worms. I must admit, Pepsi seemed to enjoy the meal worms more than crickets, though. Crickets and meal worms can be bought at pet supply stores like PetsMart and Petco, but I would recommend PetsMart. Meal worms are usually sold out more often then crickets, so beware if you're planning on only feeding meal worms to your anoles. I would also recommend that you buy the meal worms and/or crickets in a plastic bag by the dozen, not in a box. There are very hard to catch in a box like an egg carten, and it is easier to just dump a few into the tank through a plastic bag. I hope that this helped you and told you what you needed to know! :)

The computer then uses that data for calculations, moving data from RAM back to the disk when needed. <br>  <br>  .|`|ljen1oasaa	Memory in computers is arranged in a hierarchy with RAM in the mid-tiers. In a high-speed machine the time it takes signals to travel from one part of the computer to another become important. And smaller sizes of memory are faster than larger blocks of memory for the same technology. So in your computer memory is arranged from small fast blocks near the CPU to very large blocks in your disk drive or now flash drive. <br>  <br>  Memory hierarchy can look like this: <br>  1) Register memory (small very fast bits of memory on chip) <br>  2) Cache (S-RAM or custom D-RAM either on chip or off) <br>  3) Main Memory (CMOS D-RAM) <br>  4) Disk storage (magnetic or now solid state) <br>  <br>  A cache is small and close to the CPU. It operates on the principle that data you recently used may need to be used again soon, when the CPU finds data it needs in the cache this is called a "cache hit". If the CPU doesn't find that data this is called a "cache miss" and the data must come from somewhere else. The time required to get the next piece of data depends on the latency of the memory, generally this causes the CPU to pause and wait for the data from the main memory. If the data the CPU needs is actually on the disk memory this is called a page fault and the CPU continues on with another task until the data is available (since it takes a long time to get the data.)

The brain contains structures that regulate the blood pressure - such as the brain stem, which can stimulate the heart to beat faster, increasing the blood pressure.  Also, the Sympathetic division of the nervous system can stimulate the blood vessels to constrict, again increasing blood pressure until more blood is manufactured.

(Tom is 30).|`|g4nlUfmeaa	The first thing to do is express the facts as a system of equations, then use some method (like substitution, elimination, or graphing) to solve for the variables.<br>  <br>  For example, in the second question ... M will be Tom's age and D will be Todd's age.<br>  <br>  "Tom is 3 times as old as Todd" -- this one is pretty straight forward.<br>  <br>  M = 3D<br>  <br>  "In 3 years Tom's age will be 7 years more than 2 times as old as Todd."<br>  <br>  M + 3 = 2(D + 3) + 7<br>  <br>  That one is a little trickier to get.  But on the left side you have Tom's age 3 years from now (adding 3 years) and on the right side of the equation you have double (2 times) Todd's age three years from now (D + 3).  You have to put parentheses around D+3 because we're talking about twice Todd's age three years from now, so the 3 years must be doubled too.  Then you add seven because Tom is supposed to be another seven years older than Todd after the doubling.<br>  <br>  So we've got two equations:<br>  <br>  M = 3D<br>  M + 3 = 2(D + 3) + 7<br>  <br>  Let's solve by substitution.  Since M=3D, we can substitute (replace/plug in) any instance of M with 3D in the second equation, so the only variable in the equation is D, which allows us to solve for D with a constant value.<br>  <br>  M + 3 = 2(D + 3) + 7 ... substitute:<br>  3D + 3 = 2(D + 3) + 7 ... distribute:<br>  3D + 3 = 2D + 6 + 7 ... combine like terms:<br>  3D + 3 = 2D + 13 ... subtract 2D and 3 from both sides:<br>  D = 10<br>  <br>  So Todd is 10 years old.  To get Tom's age, we can plug in the constant value for Todd's age (D=10) into the first equation.<br>  <br>  M = 3D<br>  M = 3(10)<br>  M = 30<br>  <br>  Tom is 30 years old.|`|73qWMojKaa	1. b) 8<br>  2.

AA10132204	Yes, the sodium acetate if dumped directly in large quantities would be a problem.  It is an organic molecule and it would have to be degraded in the environment.  This removes O2 from the system and can shift the ecosystem.  The "low affect" you see is based on the direct toxicity of the acetate.<br>  <br>  Now, the sodium acetate is no worse than the acetic acid.  They would have about the same impact.  This system you are studying is used all the time in industry, but the acetate is run through a wastewater plant where it is extremely degradable and never gets into the environment.  Bioconcentrate means it does not degrade and instead gets stored in the body of the critters exposed where it can have long term effects.

wSRHWpItaa	Sorry, first answerer is not quite right. The virus hides away in the nervous system after the infection! The virus is introduced to the body via the lungs:<br>  <br>  After initial inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets, the virus infects the mucosae of the upper respiratory tract. Viruses reproduce in regional lymph nodes of the upper respiratory tract 2-4 days after initial infection. A second round of viral replication occurs in the body's internal organs, most notably the liver and the spleen. This secondary viremia is characterized by diffuse viral invasion of capillaries' endothelial cells and the epidermis. VZV infection of cells of the malpighian layer produces both intercellular and intracellular edema, resulting in the characteristic vesicles of the skin (the chicken pox).|`|Ew5E8nDlaa	I think it might directly affect the Dorsal Root Ganglia Cells and the trigeminal nerve cells

X4EBNoNUaa	Actually, it is because there are two shuttles that take the extramitochondrial reducing equivalent ( the H^-1 ) from the glycolysis generated NADH  ( glyceraldehyde-3 P ---- 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate step ) into the mitochondrion. One of the shuttles called the glycerol-3 phosphate shuttle brings in the H bound up in glycerol -3-P.Inside the mitochondrion the glycerol -3-P is oxidized back to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and an FAD becomes reduced to FADH2. This FADH2 can enter the ETS and produce 2 ATPs. Another shuttle called the malate aspartate shuttle takes the H^-1 into the mitochondrion bound to malate....Inside the mito the malate is converted to OAA while generating an NADH..The NADH can enter the ETS and generate 3 ATPs...some tissue have both shuttles operating  nearly equally while others may be predominantly one or the other... so summing up.... the ATPs....2 for glycolysis , 30 ATPs for the 2 GTPs in TCA and the 28 ATPs arising from the ETS via the 6NADHs from TCA  the two NADHs from the linker reaction ( pyruvate dehydrogenase ) plus the 2 FADH2 from the TCA  ( 2 + 24 _ 4 =30 ). plus either the 4 ATPs from the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle ( remember there is one H^-1 from NADH transferred PER glyceraldehyde -3-P and you have two of them  from glucose so 2 X 2ATPs = 4, or you can have 6 ATPs from 2 H^-1 being shuttled via the malate aspartate shuttle....so<br>  <br>  2 + 30 + 4 = 36<br>  2 + 30 + 6 = 38   and a combination of the two shuttles  say in a tissue it is 60% malate aspartate and 40 % glycerol -3-P shuttle then the ATP "yield " would be .40( 36 ) + .60(38) =  37.2 ATPs...  if it were 50:50 it would be a net ATP yield of 37 , etc etc .<br>  <br>  side note : The NADH formed in glycolysis must be recycled back to NAD+ so it can be reused in the pathway .

Prokaryotic cells do not have mitochondria.  Eukaryotic cells do.

In Eukaryotic cells, 38 ATP are created, but only 36 are available for use by other organelles.<br>  2.  This is similar to the first one, but some textbooks will say that Eukaryotic cells produce 38 ATP, which is technically true, but doesn't take into account that fact that 2 are reused in early glycolysis to keep the process going.

This value is:<br>  <br>  3.2 x 10^-4 M  (molar)  hydroxide ion concentration.<br>  <br>  Since Molarity= n/V   or  moles/L     (remember "n" stands for moles and "V" is the Volume in Liters),<br>  <br>  we can find the number of moles of hydroxide ion needed to give us a concentration of 3.2 x 10^-4 Molar in 750 mL of solution.<br>  <br>  Rearrange to get    <br>  <br>  moles =  Molarity x L (volume),<br>  <br>  Convert 750 mL to 0.750 L, <br>  <br>  moles =  3.2 x 10^-4 moles/L   x  0.750 L<br>  <br>  the answer here will be<br>  <br>  2.4 x 10^-4 moles of hydroxide ion.  <br>  <br>  Now we have to take into account the stoichiometry of Ca(OH)2.  It might be tricky to see on here but  I'll do the best I can.<br>  <br>  2.4 X 10^-4 moles OH-  x   ( 1 mole Ca(OH)2 /  2moles of OH-)  =<br>  <br>  equals     1.2 x 10^-4 moles of Ca(OH)2 needed -and then using the molar mass of Ca(OH)2:<br>  <br>  1.2 x 10^-4 moles Ca(OH)2   x  (74.1 grams Ca(OH)2  / 1mole Ca(OH)2   =<br>  <br>  <br>  equals 0.0088 grams of Ca(OH)2 required to give 750mL of water a pH of 10.50.
zPOW1yIkaa	Some ideas to get you started....<br>  <br>  1.  The heat gained and lost must be equal.  The warm water that's cooling down releases heat into the cool water and the calorimeter.<br>  <br>  mcΔT hot  = mcΔT cold + CΔT calorimeter<br>  <br>  30.0 g x 4.18 J/gK x (48.9 K- 30.1 K) = [30.0 g x 4.18 J/gK x (30.1 K - 25.1 K)  + C(30.1 K - 25.1 K)]....from this point, solve the equation for the value of C.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  All of the heat gain that occurs in the water and the calorimeter comes from the NaOH...temperature increases by 14 oC<br>  <br>  Heat gain = mcΔT water + CΔT calorimeter...use the same value for C for the calorimeter that you calculated in Step 1:<br>  <br>      Heat         = (100 g x 4.18 x 14 oC)  + (C x 14 oC)<br>  <br>  All of this heat came from 6.50 g of NaOH, less than 1 mole...to solve  the problem you need to solve it per mole of NaOH....use the heat from the calculation above to calculate the molar heat of solution.<br>  <br>  (Heat / 6.50 g NaOH) x (40.0 g NaOH / 1 mole NaOH) = J/mol, the heat of solution.  <br>  <br>  If you want it in kJ/mol, divide the result by 1000.
seV3BW62aa	1) natural selection would favor those that bred best, that is, those that reproduced the most<br>  2) natural selection would favor those that reproduce most and survive best. Weak individuals would eventually die out because not being able to adapt as well to the environment, and thus leave no offspring.<br>  3) natural selection would still favor those the reproduce most and survive best, if the changes are dramatic and none in the original population can survive it in the end, then they will all die out. But that's not how natural selection works: natural selection will take out those that are worst adapted first, then go on to take out more well prepared. The strongest individuals will hopefully be strong enough to survive the changes, and at least some of their offspring even better prepared for future changes. <br>  4) All adapt automatically but the weakest still dies like in the above example, if everyone can not survive. Otherwise if everybody can survive, the "fittest" individual will reproduce more (all will never reproduce equally in most kinds of animals) and thus get more offspring, it's genome will eventually dominate the species.|`|91bhiXTVaa	Of the 4 options, only #2 results in a change in population.

If you are 'haunted' the noises and such are going to be louder at night as it is more quiet and there is more attention to be had.<br>  <br>  It is usually best to start out this sort of "relationship" in a harmonious manner -- try and coexist. If it is the former owner, realize she was there a very long time and it may be hard for her to let it go.<br>  <br>  She is naturally going to be pissed because you're *touching* her things. You do need to explain that since she no longer has a physical body that she no longer needs the house and you have become the next owner.<br>  <br>  However, if it were me [and I'm a bit more tolerant/experienced in the area] I'd ask her if she'd like to stay on at the house until she was ready to move on [i.e. she figures out that she can't take it with her].<br>  <br>  The more angry she is about people in "her house" the more she is going to hang on to the anger. By putting her at ease and letting her see that you care about the house, etc...the more likely she will be to quietly hum about; if she doesn't leave all together.<br>  <br>  People usually mistake anger for evil; that is not the case. All of my 'worst' cases of "evil" activity were far from evil -- they were just pissed off. Just like physical people; you don't want to piss off the nice ones...cuz just as nice as they can be; just as angry.<br>  <br>  If you don't seem to come to an agreement, you can always send whomever is thumping around to my house...the thing about the non-physical is that you never run out of rooms.|`|sE2RH0A7aa	Don't sell the house - Your just handing somebody else the problem if you do, that's selfish.<br>  If it IS paranormal phenomena, it's not doing any harm.. yet.<br>  Just make it clear that it's YOUR house now.<br>  Also, don't encourage it by trying to communicate, in most cases it just makes the activity much stronger.<br>  Again, if it's paranormal, you'll eventually learn to cope.<br>  If the activity gets worse on it's own, then is the time you call in some help.

stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice- December 21, 2012 - is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

"Planet X" and "Nibiru" simply don't exist. The Mayan calendar ends a cycle, but there were no predictions of the end of the world. The Sun doesn't line up with the galactic centre; it's 6 degrees off.

I'll tell you what I told another asker:<br>  Basically what the mayans said is that the world wont blow up or something but that WE will destroy ourselves. They say that war will play a part (possibly Al Queda and Taliban). A solar flare that scientists predicted would come in 2010, 2011 or 2012 would break all electrical equipment killing thousands and even send people looting and killing others. A comet could apparently hit earth in 2012 winter ( I dont believe that). Religion ( considering that al queda are supposedly religious). Famine from things like disease. And death from murders and natural causes. There are more but I can't remember them.|`|PCsdELD7aa	Hahahahah, no!<br>  The Mayan calendar only went up to 2012, they probably didn't finish it, etc. It's really not a big deal.

t2RFXYUcaa	You were correct in wanting to convert the .787 torr into atm because that's the unit of the gas law constant. Convert the 35 C into Kelvin = 308.<br>  <br>  The equation for osmotic pressure is (pi) = MRT; M is the molarity(moles/L), R is the gas constant (L-atm/mol-K), and T is the temperatur (in K).<br>  <br>  Substitute .001035atm for (pi), .08206 for R, and 308 for T.<br>  For M, you'll want to write it as (mol/L) and substitute 1L for L.<br>  From this point, divide (pi) by RT, and you should be left with (mol/1L).<br>  To get rid of the 1L, multiply both sides by 1L, and you are left with moles.<br>  <br>  To get the molar mass, divide the 10g by the moles you obtain in the answer.

AA10034285	The answer to your question is - yes, a glass of soda could apparently move by itself without any direct human intervention whatsoever (Sorry about the telekinesis.). There are a number of perfectly reasonable and scientific reasons why such an event could occur. In no particular order of likelihood they are:-<br>  <br>  1. If the glass had been cold before it was placed on the table, any air trapped between the not quite flat bottom of the glass and the smooth flat table top would expand in the heat of the room, or with the warmth of the table top, and could literally lift the glass off the top of the table and set it in motion. This is the same way that a hovercraft rises on a central cushion of air and then tends to scoot to one side or another until the main forward thrust propeller brings it's motion under control.<br>  <br>  2. If the glass had been cold and wet before it was placed on the table, any water trapped between the not quite flat bottom of the glass and the smooth flat table top would expand in the heat of the room, or with the warmth of the table top, and could lift the glass off the table and set it in motion (just as for air - see item 1.).<br>  <br>  3. Mini-earthquakes or tremors are far more common than most people realize, occurring almost every day, almost everywhere on earth inhabited by people, and, obviously, particularly in known earthquake zones and areas of high volcanic activity. Such a mini-earthquake, although detectable by instruments, might be quite unnoticed by a member of the public going about their normal business. Such a mini-earthquake could very easily move your glass across a smooth table top in the way you describe.<br>  <br>  4. Traffic, especially heavy goods vehicles, trucks and buses, set up vibrations in the ground that are just like the mini-earthquakes mentioned above, and with the same effects.<br>  <br>  5. Surface and underground rail transport also set up vibrations in the ground with the same effect as mini-earthquakes.<br>  <br>  6. Aircraft, especially high performance or low flying jet propelled aircraft, set up shock waves in the air which have exactly the same effects as the mini-earthquakes mentioned above.<br>  <br>  7. There are lots of other things like mining, quarrying, drilling, and pile-driving on construction sites, which can all have the same effects as the mini-earthquakes mentioned above.<br>  <br>  I hope that is enough to set your mind at rest - at least until you find out that you can walk though walls too.|`|chuNwSTtaa	the vibration you caused by lightly putting your hand on the table caused the soda to glide since it is wet at the bottom, etc...|`|AA11673762	Things can happen that don't seem natural, but happen anyway.

I thought I despised math in the seventh grade too, then I was skipped into Algebra 1 because I was on the honor roll all 4 quarters of the seventh grade in a private school in greater New Orleans. I switched to a different private school for my junior and senior years. I had to take calculus to graduate. I already had some underlying interest in math, because I had wanted to be an astronomer since I was 6 years old, when I found out/was told what an astronomer was.<br>  <br>  The first thing I did after I graduated from college with a bachelor's in history was immediately enroll in calculus 1 for summer school.<br>  <br>  The first thing to understand is that you are NOT dumb in math. You just need more time and practice to fully understand math. I still didn't realize that my PSAT and SAT scores meant that I wasn't dumb in math when I started college in August, 1971. I spent a year enrolled at the University of Arizona after my first bachelor's degree, supposedly as an astronomy major, and I finally realized that I had to change my attitude about math. I made math a personal challenge and puzzle that might actually be fun to figure out. I read a lot of non-fiction books by Isaac Asimov. I started counting things, like stair steps. I went back home to New Orleans and Tulane University to work on a bachelor's degree in geology. I took calculus and physics, again. I had a "light bulb going on in my head" moment when my Dad was taking me to a physics class. I was trying to understand what a vector quantity was (how can a number have direction?) when my Dad made a left turn from Carrollton Ave. across the street car lines. My body swayed. and the light bulb went on. I'd been thinking about momentum when he started the turn. My body swayed from inertia because it was trying to go in the same direction that it had been going before the turn started. I understood fully and exactly what a vector quantity was and what inertia was in that "light bulb" flash. Physics (applied math) is real life, not abstract concepts.<br>  <br>  You can't make an aptitude GRE score of 620 on the math section if you are dumb in math, which is what I did in January, 1980. I may still mentally roll my eyes when there are three or more integral symbols on a page, but as long as I have the time to take the equation apart, and put it back together, it's fun, except during a math test. I find math quite fascinating now, especially when you can analyze, understand, and explain all the flooding in south-east Louisiana from Katrina's storm surges down to two simple equations: Force = mass x acceleration, F= ma; Inflow/outflow = vertical cross sectional Area of a "stream" x velocity of the stream, q = AV.<br>  <br>  OK, I suspect I know exactly who is giving me thumbs down on a lot of my answers. Talk about juvenile, jealous, spiteful behavior, Edselford, a.k.a. HBosch, Schwegmann, Kashbuk, EdselRanger on the nola.com fourms.|`|9syEUfnqaa	in all honesty, you can't make yourself enjoy or love anything your brain isnt set to like, yea your dad might be good at it so just tell him you feel embarrassed when he says that to you, and that its not that easy for you to understand as well as he does..what i suggest is just to study more, your still in 7th grade and you'll get it soon.|`|WEHjGaVKaa	Maybe having someone other than your dad teach you would be the best thing.

I hate math too but when I listen carefully to what the teacher says I understand it really well. When I understand it I tend to like it a lot. Maybe you could use math with something that ou really like. For example make up math problems about food, shopping and other things that you enjoy. For example I hated multiplication my whole life. I didn't understand it very well and I though it was boring. Then one day my mom and I went to CVS and she got me two monster energy drinks (I am in loove with monster?) and I was reading how many calories were in one can of monster (90 calories) and then I started multipling all these big numbers in my head! At first I was trying to find out how man calories where in two cans of monster then suddenly I started finding out how my calories were in 50 cans of it! It made me totally understand how to multiply! I was amazed! Try doing something lie that and I'm sure you'll get it in no time!|`|vlrqFhxlaa	dont be affraid to ask questions bcoz if u dont ask questions u wont be able to love math.so be free to ask questions dont be affraid of him.I think u will love maths if u understand it|`|DAizz4NAaa	i like to think of food and $$$ lol. think of your favorite object. trust me it helps alot.

3443ca8928f42fd8cfd8b8d2964936d4aa	Hi. Most stars, the Sun included, come into being when gravity causes the gas in the vicinity to condense. The gas forms a disk, then a central object, then perhaps a group on other objects in the leftover gas and dust. The mass determines the size (mass) of the central object, usually a star, and the other objects, planets. It is physics that determines what happens later.
nUYuqUQTaa	# "?? What is the C in (nCk) stand for?"<br>   <br>  It stands for "combination" -- in this case, of "n" things chosen "k" at a time, so the expression "n choose k" for the number of ways of picking "k" events out of "n" events. In your example, <br>  11C5 = 11! ÷ 5!(11 - 5)! <br>  = (11/1)*(10/2)*(9/3)*(8/4)*(7/5) = 11*3*2*7 = 462 <br>  so P(X=5) = 462*(0.3)^5*(0.7)^6 = 0.132

17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	Very simple: lack of money. Congress cut NASA's funding after the sixth lunar landing in 1972 because the public seemed to have lost interest in the Moon and the "space race" with the Soviet Union had been won. It was tragically bad timing, because Apollo 17 in 1972 was the _first_ Apollo voyage to have a trained scientist, Harrison Schmitt, on board, and was supposed to be the first of three scientific expeditions.<br>  <br>  More was learned about the Moon and its history in that voyage than in the previous 5 put together, and much more would have been learned if the two next voyages had been funded. Instead the US space program was redirected into the boondoggle of the shuttle and space station programs, neither of which has made much contribution to science.<br>  <br>  Whenever this question is asked, some people reply that we now know everything there is to know about the Moon. What a ridiculous idea! How can anyone say that we learned everything about a place with almost as much dry land as the Earth in six visits of a few hours or days?|`|KHSOVxViaa	Why they've never returned?

It's much easier to send an unmanned rover to do what scientists want to do there. <br>  <br>  What benefit would another group of humans hopping around the Moon surface and planting their country's flags bring to our science? Human presence on the Moon is more of a space race matter than a scientific matter.<br>  <br>  On January 14, 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush called for a plan to return manned missions to the Moon by 2020 (see Vision for Space Exploration). NASA is now planning for the construction of a permanent outpost at one of the lunar poles. The People's Republic of China has expressed ambitious plans for exploring the Moon and has started the Chang'e program for lunar exploration, successfully launching its first spacecraft, Chang'e-1, on October 24, 2007. Like NASA, China hopes to land people on the Moon by 2020.
