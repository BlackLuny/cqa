I am worried because there are some days that i can't even get out of bed and i was also just put on a low sodium diet to possibly help with the dizziness.  will they be able to treat me with this while i'm in iraq?  any info would be appreciated.  Thanks!

I jsut saw on the news that a 71 year old wallmart employee ws knocked down by a off duty cop for no reason. The guy even yelled he was a cop.      He was suspended for 29 days but he's done stuff like this before and was caught twice bullying someone. Yet his fellow police officers overlook it.       It's similar to when some jerk cop sprayed mace in a teenage girl's eyes which was caught in camera at a fast food restaurant. She sued and won but the cop wasn't fired. He got away with it.      What does ittake to get rid of these kinds of cops? It makes me wonder if they are all like that and the reason they protect them because they know that someday they will need to cover up their indiscretions?      Why can't they be fired?

This also includes Obama. I guess he should've thought twice about voting for that ridiculous bill      Also,why did McCain vote for it? I saw him this morning on American Morning, and he talked about pork and the current stimulus bill.He voted for that TARP bill which was loaded with pork.       Oh and Sarah Palin came to D.C. to support the current stimulus bill,which is loaded with pork. I thought she was a "reformer" and a "maverick". What happened to all of that?      How hard is to for these idiot politicians on both sides to work together and not put their own special interests in the bill?      Democrats loaded it up with their interests,and the Republicans aren't happy that they didn't get to load up the bill with their interests.Instead they're hiding under the "Oh,we care about the tax payers" excuse.       They didn't seem to care about that for the first six years of Bush's presidency when they controlled Congress.The spending that Bush did is one of the reasons there is a huge deficit and the fact that the national debt doubled under him.I didn't hear them talk about "fiscal responsibility" then

Same with Hillary Clinton in 2007 when she got all that critcism      This is my favorite."You're just jealous of Sarah Palin". HAHAHAHAHA      They sound like the fangirls of Miley Cyrus,the Jonas Brothers,High School Musical,and Twilight. Anytime someone says that these losers suck,they always say,"You're just jealous that you're not as talented as them"      Give me a break. It make no sense to say that at all.

20090202190240AArJkC8	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I ask a serious question about trials and witnesses?	When I was 13 years old I witnessed a murder first hand. I was so scared that I literally did not speak for 4 years about anything, I did not speak one single word for 4 whole years. When I was 17 I broke down and could not hold it in anymore, I had to tell someone what I saw. I went to tell a police officer and believe it or not, as odd as it may sound, he was actually coming that very day to ask me whether or not I knew anything about the case.  I gave a statement to the police and was interviewed for hours and hours. The problem was was that this man was already in jail for committing 2 other murders. The prosecutor told me that the case could not go to trial, but he could not explain why, he said it had to wait. Then when I was 21 I got a call from him again telling me it was finally going to go to trial. However, I am 23 now and it has been postponed again indefinitely.   When I ask why it keeps being postponed, they give me some round about answer. I keep telling them that this is really inconvenient to me because every time they tell me it may go to trial I have to prepare myself to see this man. Can anyone explain to me why this possibly may not have gone to trial yet?    I live in Nevada, however, the crime took place in New Jersey and is being prosecuted there.

SENATE DEBATES $888 BILLION STIMULUS BILL   The House passed a stimulus bill last week with no GOP votes. (How They Voted) The Senate begins its debate this week with GOP Senators opposed as well but looking to change it through amendments. The Senate version, which will combine two bills(S. 350 and S. 336), differs from the House version H.R. 1. The Senate bill provides for a temporary fix to the alternative minimum tax and additional spending.      The stimulus package is criticized from all sides. The GOP says there aren't enough tax cuts. Democrats want more spending. Some question the effect of the stimulus, especially some of the proposed spending. Economists say something big needs to be done fast. Should Congress pass or defeat the Senate version of the stimulus bill? Select your view below and tell Congress what you think.

20090202144449AApIyL6	Politics & Government;Elections	Should banks who abuse their republican "bail out" money be forced to give the money back?	Despite a near collapse that required $45 billion in federal taxpayer bailout funds, Bank of America sponsored a five day carnival-like affair just outside the Super Bowl stadium this past week as President Obama decried wasteful spending on Wall St.      The event - known as the NFL Experience - was 850,000 square feet of sports games and interactive entertainment attractions for football fans and was blanketed in Bank of America logos and marketing calls to sign up for football-themed banking products      In 2006, Citigroup entered into a $400 million contract with the New York Mets for naming rights to the team's stadium, now called Citi Field. That was then. Housing prices were climbing, no-doc loans were flying out the door and Citigroup was encouraging us all to "Live Richly."      This is now. Citigroup has taken $45 billion in bailout funds -- plus another several hundred billion in guarantees -- to stay afloat as it contemplates breaking into smaller pieces. With that cash in mind, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich, one of the House's most liberal Democrats, and Texas Rep. Ted Poe, one of the most conservative Republicans, see a problem with the $400 million contract. The duo wrote newly-confirmed Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner Thursday urging him to nix the deal.
20090202154051AACd9EE	Politics & Government;Elections	Is the primary reason for the demise of the Republicans is the significant change in America's demographics?	Conservative Republicans are in denial      George Bush will go down as the worst United States President in American history, this in only a minor factor in the demise of the Republican Party.      It is obvious math is not taught in middle America. Conservative Republicans fail to see the importance of doing the math to see the demographic evolution of America to a Hispanic America.      We will not get there today. We may get there tomorrow but the day is coming when Arizona and Texas will be in play with the growth of Hispanic Americans and the earliest date is 2012 when Arizona and Texas will vote Democratic.      As for Republican Party restructuring, nothing can be done with a new direction on the issues because at the heart of all white conservative Republicans is a fundamental difference in the way they perceive Hispanics and blacks.      Most ominous for Republicans, the GOP is in dire straits as evident in consecutive election cycles the Republican Party now finds itself in its worst straits since the rise of the conservative coalition — a minority party without the White House, fewer seats in the House and Senate, only 21 governors and full control of just 14 state legislatures.      All the king's men can strategize on how to prevent the dinosaurs from traveling down the road to oblivion but nothing can put Humpty Dumpty back together again from his fall.      J. Garrido

20090202175539AABcNKy	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Do Israeli policies make sense?	Look this over carefully, and let me know if it makes sense to you.       "Israel's foreign minister threatened Monday to keep hitting Hamas as long as it attacks Israel, ruling out negotiations with the Islamic rulers of Gaza just eight days before national elections in which she is running for prime minister.   Tzipi Livni's tough statement came as a Hamas delegation went to Cairo for talks Tuesday with Egyptian mediators on a long-term truce with Israel, building on a two-week informal cease-fire that followed Israel's bruising offensive in Gaza."       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090202/ap_o...       And now look at this:      "Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the military wing of the Fatah faction led by Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, told Al Jazeera that it carried out the attacks.   The Hamas faction seized control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah forces in June 2007, but several other Palestinian groups, including the Brigades, continue to operate in Gaza.      Israel, however, holds Hamas responsible for all rocket fire coming from Gaza."       http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middle...       So, it appears that though Hamas has announced its intent for peace, Israel has no intention of complying. Hamas has launched no attacks, but Israel blames them for any attack. So by Israel's definition, Hamas is still attacking, and Hamas has no say in Livni's demands.       Now what's wrong with this picture?

(a) A lawful occupant within a home or other place of residence is justified in using any degree of force that the occupant reasonably believes is necessary, including deadly force, against an intruder to prevent a forcible entry into the home or residence or to terminate the intruder's unlawful entry (i) if the occupant reasonably apprehends that the intruder may kill or inflict serious bodily harm to the occupant or others in the home or residence, or (ii) if the occupant reasonably believes that the intruder intends to commit a felony in the home or residence.

20090202174801AANNaHT	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What do I tell the police?  Who do I call?	SHORT VERSION...We were a band of four members.  Two of the members (who are brothers) decided to quit and keep the most expensive piece of equipment which I paid for and the band equipment fund has not fully paid me back for.      LONG VERSION... We lost our lead singer and his PA equipment.  We had paying gigs scheduled and needed PA equipment so we could play the shows (and continue to make some money). We agreed that they money we made from the shows would go to pay for this equipment. Since I was taking over singing, I put the equipment on my credit card back in August. After putting some money towards the equipment they got flaky and stopped paying me for the equipment and justified it using very fuzzy math. I still owe money on said equipment.      After a show in December the two brothers packed up the most expensive piece of equipment which I paid for (it's a PA head valued at $500 new 6 months ago). After ignoring my phone calls for they called me to inform me that they want to quit the band. They said "so what are we going to do about the PA?" -expecting compensation since they put money into the band fund to pay for part of it. They say that they have someone who will buy it for $350.  The fourth member and I agreed to play a show for free giving them the proceeds ($300+free booze all night) in exchange for the PA.  This offer wasn't good enough and they want $350 cash.        They have made about $800 between the two of them from shows that we played with the equipment that I purchased and only have put in about $300 towards the equipment (which is money they never had in the first place mind you). They would have made NOTHING if I didn't buy the equipment.      Last resort is calling the cops.  What do I tell the police?  Who do I ask for?  Will they even bother to help me?  Can they help me?  I just want my stuff back...

While trying to do a good deed, she was then rear ended by what she believes was an intoxicated driver because they hit and ran. Now her 2007 Chevy Cobalt LT Coupe that she was leasing is now totaled and the insurance company isn't paying her a dime. She was almost at the end of her lease. She and her friend suffered from whip lash and are extremely sore. They've closed her case and aren't trying to pursue her hit and run driver. She did give a description of the vehicle that hit her but isn't the insurance company suppose to give her what she's already paid on her vehicle instead of making her pay her deductible and closing her case? Now she's out of a car and it clearly wasn't her fault.

When I was hired there was no warning that he smoke in the office, but he did. Then my lung collapsed, twice. (Not directly related to smoking, it was just a spontaneous). My husband talked to my boss while I was in the hospital and told him I could no longer be around smoke. He then promised he would no longer smoke inside. Well, now we are in a new building and his office his a good distance from mine. BUT he seems to think that if he opens his outside door and closes his hallway door that he can smoke. I can smell it and I can't go to the bathroom (right next to his office) without having a HUGE coughing fit. I am already looking for a new job, but I just want to know my legal rights. If he sends me into a coughing fit and my lung collapses because of it I am going to be pretty pissed...especially since I don't have benefits with this company. I don't get paid if I am out sick!

20090202191657AABLYER	Politics & Government;Politics	In an effort to combat pressure from the GOP, Obama had no choice but to hire lobbyist and otherwise appear to?	just so we are all clear, Obama was NOT lying when he said he would not hire lobbyist, throw money at programs or create porkbarrel earmarks. What he did not count on, however, was being met with such extreme pressure from the GOP, who continue to play politics and as their ideas are, may even be doing so to damage Obama's reputation, making it look like he is lying when he merely had to change things because of them. I do understand that it is extremely dangerous to let the economy fall victim to politics, but the bottom line is Obama is doing what he is doing because the GOP continues to play politics, so Obama has no choice but to hire lobbyist on behalf of his own interests and create earmarks full of pork, which he is essentially doing to assert his party's authority over the GOP, NOT because he does not agree with the GOP's ideas. He DOES want to work with the GOP, but they refuse to work with him, taking an all-or-nothing approach as if trying to take full control.

20090202123810AAxR89i	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I sue my car dealership?	I bought a car back in August of 2008 and now they want to repossess the car. I bought a used car and trade-in mine for the same monthly payments. I gave the dealer a $400 down payment. Here came October and I still had not received a car payment so I called the dealership and they said that the loan is off their hands and with the new lender company. Basically, they got their money and had nothing else to do with us. I called my old lender to see if my trade-in car had been paid off, and it was. So now I call the new financing company and they say they have no records of us or our car. I called the dealer again and they said they got their money so it was on the new company. So now I have a car, but I'm not making payments. I called the new company in Oct, Nov, and Dec. Now in January a guy from the financing company calls me and says that someone just "brought this to his attention" (he even has the wrong car on file). He said this loan was denied by them back in August and the dealer had 2 weeks to resubmit an offer. I asked the guy how did the dealer get paid and he said that they have a process where they can self-fund themselves. Sooooo, this guy says I have to pay all the months I haven't paid or my car will get repossessed.      Can I sue the dealer for failing to communicate to me (the customer) that the loan was denied? Plus, they self-funded themselves when they shouldn't have.

20090202130117AA0uMzg	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What is the best way to dispute a bill with an attorney?	I had an unfortunate incident that requires me to hire an attorney, and this leads to another unfortunate event of trusting and hiring the wrong attorney for the job. The attorney only came to court for my case for less than half an hour, in which the court was not actually a notice of postponement of the court date. The poor performance of the attorney made me decide to change my attorney.      Unfortunately, I have paid the attorney a full amount retainer fee. She charges by the hour, hence she should refund me the rest of the amount that was not spent on my case. When I receive the bill, I was shocked -- not only did she charge me for the time spent on the free consultation, but she also made up the time that she "spent with her boss to talk about my case" and "talked to the DA's office", which when I asked her about her discovery of the case, she discovered NOTHING. ( to be honest, how could a lawyer be lame like that? I found out about my charges by calling the court office myself.)       So the question is: what should I do to dispute the bill and get my money back? Is there any protection for consumers of attorney services? I know that I can file a complaint to the state bar of California, but that may not help me in getting my money back. I desperately need the money for the other attorney that I am hiring. Help!

This is IN ADDITION to their paycheck.

I don't get a government stipend for my rent every month in addition to my paycheck.        If you're a military member, please feel free to justify it, but if your reason is going to be "...we could be sent overseas at any time..." don't bother.  I don't want to hear that.
