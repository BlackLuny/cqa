20090227103437AAy4JxA	Education & Reference;Other - Education	This is going to sound weird, but....?	I live in a double at college with a roommate.   I brought hall cough drops to school with me, but i didnt like them and havent eaten any since.   One day we lost the remote to the tv and i saw 1 cough drop wrapper on the floor under my bed near the heater. I thought it was weird because i hadnt eaten any. A week later I dropped something off my bed and noticed that there were at least 15 cough drop wrappers all ripped up near the heater! I asked my roommate if she was eating my cough drops and she said no she had her own (a different kind). We asked anyone that has been in our room in the past week if they had eaten any cough drops and they all said no. We though maybe they were falling out of the radiator? But then I was folding laundry and putting it away in my bottom drawer of my dresser. There were 40 hall cough drop wrappers just laying all in my clothes in the drawer. Most of them were in the corners of my drawer all bunched up on different sweatshirts. I was really freaked at first, but took all my clothes out and there was nothing in the drawer other than the wrappers and 1 uneaten cough drop. Whats even freakier is that the cough drops are put away in a drawer that shut up. We thought maybe some sort of animal was in the room (my roommate got bit by something the other day when she was sleeping) but the cough drops are shut in the drawer and the cough drops are opened on both ends (something an animal cant do?). Does anyone have any ideas what might be eating these cough drops?

20090227105648AAmOrJ2	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Where do I look for grants/scholarships for LPN school?	SORRRRYYYYY!!! Hit the wrong key! I wanted to add: yes, I've done FAFSA and have asked my school/college's financial aid departments and struck out. This is why I am putting this question to Yahoo!Answers. I've tried Tylenol and searches on the internet with dead ends and advertisements for other schools.  What I need are scholarship websites or places that actually give grants or specific places to put in applications. Many thanks for your thoughts so far, but I need more. Thanks again!

20090227110619AAycYoh	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I stay in school?	I am a junior Econ major right now, and will be a senior at the end of the semester.  However, for the last two semesters I have felt like dropping out and just working for a while until I want to go back to school.  All of my friends and my brother, all seem to know what they want to do for a living and I have no idea what I want to do.  I really hate school, and am sick of doing around 4 hours or more of homework a day, only to have more assigned the next day.  I just feel helpless, like it does not matter what I do or how hard I work because I am just going to have more work the next day anyway.  For my money situation, I currently just have enough to barely make it til the end of the semester and then I have to find a job to pay for next yr. (I have already been looking for employment now), but the job market is so terrible right here in MT that I don't even know if I will find a job this summer.  Both my parents would be extremely upset if I did this I already know, but I am just not interested in school anymore, I mean they already picked my major for me, I wanted to major in History because I find it interesting.  I went to the career fair on campus yesterday and talked to some employers (Wells Fargo, NW Financial, .etc..) about Finance positions and the more I learned about working for those places, the more I realized that I dod not want to work in any Economics related field.  I also talked to US Customs, and the Border Patrolm and their jobs sounded fun and like something I would not get bored from.  The Border Patrol did not require a college degree, and paid more than the Banks and Investment firms did too.  I really just feel like doing that instead of going to school because the recruiter said that some of the agents do attend school, albeit 1 class at a time, but you still are going to school nonetheless.  Also, if I can't find a job this summer I won't be able to be in school anyways since I will be out of money and FAFSA is just out to screw the middle class and claims that my parents have $13,000 just lying around for me to go to school, which is crazy since I am paying for my own school.  My parents can't afford this because they still are paying off their house, saving for retirement, paying car loans, and I am sure there is more.  Anyway, what do you all out there think I should do?

20090309200052AAeI3TA	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Descriptive writing for English class; what do you think?	A dull iron gate barely kept closed by a broken lock is nearly obscured by ragged privacy hedges that haven't been trimmed in years. Some branches have been torn off, leaving bare patches and the few branches that remain are tangled together so that no ending or beginning can be seen. Past the desolate gate, a cobbled path worn down by hundreds of footsteps leads through an overgrown garden.   A weathered stone angel stretches to the sky, its wings too heavy to fly. A lone sunflower stands by the angel, its brothers choked by the weeds long ago.  The slender branches of an ancient weeping willow slump to the ground, nearly covering a dilapidated car that was once sleek and beautiful.     Its bright red paint has faded and chipped, giving the appearance of dried blood. Rusted doors hang limply from their frames, like a man dangling from a gallows. Its windshield has long since vanished, only leaving a shards of glass as proof that it ever existed.     A forlorn house rests by the car, its rotten door hanging open like a panting beast on the verge of death. The moldy shutters sigh as they shudder in the slight breeze, almost as if they are wistfully remembering when this barren place was full of life. Now, their only inhabitant is a mangy, flea-bitten cat that perches on the collapsing roof, its amber eyes glinting. Ribs show faintly through its skin and its ear has been torn.     Despite its sad condition, it leaps deftly from the roof to the moss-covered porch and climbs onto a chair that has been warped by rain, apparently taking notice of the battered welcome mat. The cat rests for but a moment before slinking off and leaving the dead in peace.

Here's # 1:   Within an article titled, “ADL Congratulates British Prime Minister for Being First to Sign Declaration against Anti-Semitism,” Abraham H. Foxman discusses the example the British Prime Minister set for other government officials. Foxman is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) director and he states, “[Prime Minister] Gordon Brown set an important example for others to follow…” This is referring to the fact that the London Declaration is calling attention to the issue of anti-Jewish prejudice around the world. The ADL has taken part in coalitions to help the fight against anti-Semitism in order to find a way to decrease the intolerance. Foxman declares that “Too many leaders were silent in the face of blatant anti- Semitic displays at recent demonstrations against Israel and following attacks on Jewish institutions.” Since the Prime Minister has signed the declaration against anti-Semitism, there is hope that the act will have an impact on other government officials to step up and do something in accordance to help the cause.      And here's #2:   Lying has been around nearly as long as humans have. It’s a problem in every workplace, every school and every household; but the even bigger problem with lying is being able to tell whether or not it’s happening. In the article “You Can’t Hide Your Lying...Face?”, Jennifer Vendemia and David Lykken, both psychology professors, debate where the detection techniques lie. According to Lykken “The most effective lie-detection technique isn’t a traditional polygraph examination but instead a "guilty knowledge" test, in which a polygraph machine measures the reactions of people when they see several items”. Vendemia disagrees and thinks the answer lies beneath the skin. "You have to engage in a certain number of cognitive activities -- you have to pull the truthful information from your memory, inhibit that information, create a deceptive response and make a decision to deliver that response. You have to engage in these steps to tell a lie, a complicated process involving different parts of the brain” and according to her, her brain wave tracking device can detect 94 percent of lies during tests. Vendemia predicts “It might be as soon as 2010, perhaps using elements of thermal facial scans, brain scans and other technology” but either way they both agree, with Thomas O’Connor, a justice professor who teaches about lie detection, “I think lying is here to stay."      Any suggestions on how to connect them?      THANKS!

But I also got a lot of confused people who said it didn't make sense b/c the lines didn't all relate to the same point. But the point of the poem was to put down what one could imagine a world to be like. So that doesn't mean that the first line sets the meaning of the poem, it's just one point- in other words... a lot of the lines have their own meaning. (yet similar because the whole thing is about...a messed up world) Okay I'll shut up xD      Here it is--         Can you imagine...   A world untouched by man,   A beach that has no sand?   A world without air,   Every forest on Earth stripped bare?   A song with no meaning,   Being in love minus the hurting?   A place with no conflict,   No point of view to contradict?   Erasing all of mankind's greed,   Preventing bloodshed for where there is no need?   A nation where people look beyond the surface,   A nation where everything you have is embraced?   Going through life without a single fear,   Living in a world where all are sincere?         (Don't be too harsh because this is my second poem and im 14 =|)   Thanks in advance!

20090309210931AA4k78m	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Do you think that i have a chance at getting into Brown University?	Hey guys!   So I want your honest opinion- do you think I can get into Brown U?   I am a junior in high school. I take some honors classes and have As and Bs. I am a good student, but definately not outstanding. The thing that I feel sets me apart from others is my passion for one thing- and that's acting. I have been in lots of Boston indie films and many plays. Currently I am even working on writing my own play (hopefully producing it this summer) with the guidance of my acting coach. I'm taking a scriptwriting class at Dartmouth this spring during the third trimester.   I really have passion and drive and I am not well rounded at all- I am an extremist, but that is what sets me apart. I am not like other teenaged actors, either. I love offbeat roles. My last role was a mentally ill character in a short play that I wrote with a friend. I also enjoy making my own short videos.      I also am starting a charity fund to raise money for humane societies.      I haven't taken the SATs yet, but my score on the PSAT was a little above an 1800 and that was without studying. If i study I know i can do better on the real SATs. I am also taking an SAT subject test in math.      so do you think I have a chance of getting into Brown for acting/theatre? I have a passion for acting AND a passion for Brown. I think its the right place for me.      BUT I want to be realistic. If you don't think I could get in, do you have any suggestions for other schools that you think would be a good fit for me?      Thanks! :)

Because you are in the area, you decide to inquire about it.       a). The sales representative here tells you they also have two floor plans available, but they only have 38 homes available. Write an equation that illustrates the situation. Use x and y to denote floor plan #1 and floor plan #2 respectively.      X + Y= 38      b) The representative tells you that floor plan #1 sells for $175,000 and floor plan #2 sells for $200,000. She also mentions that all the available houses combined are worth $7,200,000. Write an equation that illustrates this situation. Use the same variables you used in part a.      175,000x + 200,000y = 7,200,000      c) Use elimination to determine how many houses with each floor plan are available. Explain how you arrived at your answer.
20090309235319AAziJml	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Paying for College: Can I get my Dad involved?	I am a senior in high school and my parents have been divorced since I was 2. At the time they set up an in prompt to account for my college when I was older. My father seemed completely willing to help pay for college and his other two boys from his previous marriage were headed in that direction so my mother had no concerns. This, of course was before my mother divorced my father.      As the account's existence remained, my father to turned a complete 180 and refuse to pay for his two son's college. It was a red flag too late, without any legal binding my father had not signed a thing concerning my college, though the joint account still exists.      Two years ago my father and I got into a big fight about my car. My parents had bought me a car in response to my success at a college prep school in which I was excelling. They thought I deserved it. My father refused to pay for any of it and believed it was all my mother’s doing, and she was trying to screw him over again. He ended up paying for less than half, less than his share, but he did help. After that I stopped seeing him.       After repeated talks with him and my mother I have conclude that there is no way for my father to consider giving me much money for college at all.       We have requested from him the entirety of the college fund and then fill in the gaps; all in all he would share the burden 50/50 with my parents.       He told us he is willing to give us less than half of the fund required and none of the college fund which had been set aside for me in the first place. To put this in numbers he is willing to pay for $4,000 of a $17,000 a year invoice, not even half.      I am at a road where there is no easy path. My father makes an insane amount of money, I know this because of the calls he gives my mother (which I have witnessed) where he calls her names and tells her how much money he's making while she makes so little. My mother makes $48,000, my father is $160,000 and he got bonuses, two years ago was $66,000 (but he has already called and told us it was twice as much this year)      Because there is no legal binding in the courts about my college we cannot force him, nor can we persuade him. I'm being told to go after my grandmother, which makes me sick to my stomach, she's 93 years old.       Again I'm not sure what to do I find myself in a place I never thought I would be, a rock and a hard place.      I'm not sure if anyone can offer any help. I will receive a $1,700 a year scholarship, and the FASFA, so far, has given us little hope, my mother makes too much money. If you're wondering why this is all an issue then if she makes so much then you still don't understand. We are upside-down on our house, (we will walk away when I leave for college and my parents will rent) my step dad is out of work (he was in real-estate) and we have little in savings which was drained after the bubble burst in the housing market.       I'm not sure if anyone can give me any advice, I think I've looked everywhere, and well, I'm looking for a job right now.       Thanks for reading.

20090310010312AAkzPM2	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Can I start homeschooling when reg school year is almost over.?	I have been having anxiety issues and it just stresses me out to be in school right now.   The school year ends June 15th but I just don't think I can stay in school for much longer.   I think homeschooling would be a better option for me right now.   When I search on google for home school programs I just find a bunch of stuff that costs way too much money.   I want to just find something where I can get a curriculum and then just buy used textbooks and other materials and maybe set something up with my normal school to go in && take my regents.   The only thing which screws with it a little bit is that my school goes on a semester/block schedule.   We have four 80 minute blocks every day and the core classes like ss,english,math and science are taken everyday for one semester. Instead of every other day all year long.So this year I already have 1 credit of science and one credit of global.       How exactly would it work. Because this semester I am taking global 2, so in school I would be finishing that in June, but would I be able to continue with homeschooling during the summer as well.   Through school I am already taking an online course of English 11 through PLATO.   So if I switched to homeschooling I would then be doing Global 2 and English 11.   But if I did homeschooling would I be able to take other classes as well to graduate early.   Well not really graduate early because my original graduation year is 2009 but due to anxiety I dropped out my sophomore year.    So I fell behind.      I highly doubt I'll get any answers now since I wrote such a long question, nobody probably even bothered to read everything.

20090310020640AAWkOMm	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Why can't we........?	Bring the Tibetan people, and their culture to America? I just read about the damage the Chinese society has caused these people and I wonder why we cannot offer these people safe haven in America. We have huge swaths of deeply isolated and mountainous regions in the Rockies that would be perfect to accommodate their culture. They are a very self sufficient people, and certainly are too proud to take anything from our society without returning something of equal value.      What I would like to know, as an American, if we are so powerful,and so right, and so much more civilized, and more free, and more advanced than anyone else on Earth, then why can't we help these people that are currently living in conditions that have been quoted as being "hell on Earth". Clearly the Chinese do not want them there, and clearly the Tibetans do not want to be ruled by them.      Are we so ignorant and ego-maniacal, that we cannot offer a legitimately oppressed culture safehaven in the United States. Obama has said that he is about hope and change. Does that hope and change stop at the border or do we have any intention at all of sharing or spreading freedom to all those who wish it, or do you think we should have just tore down the statue of liberty on the day of 9/11/01?       Every day we lose more and more of our freedoms, while the rest of the world looks to us for hope and change. Pretty soon, we will be the ones needing safehaven, and you know what the world will tell us? I won't say it here, I think you all know. There is no reason why we cannot open some of our unused land to those who are capable and willing to make use of that land to preserve their culture. Perhaps the Tibetans could teach us a thing or two about self-reliance and respect for nature as well. Seems like a fair trade to me. What about the rest of you? I look forward to some of your answers.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_o...

I am currently about to start my courses at a local technical college so I can receive a TCS (Telecommunications Specialist) Certificate so I could transfer to almost any college or university in Georgia, if I meet transfer requirements...I was told by someone in the financial aid department that I wouldn't receive the Pell Grant because I'm just receiving a certificate,but if I were trying to get a degree or diploma I would receive it. I know I'm guaranteed to get the Hope Grant though. Is this true..or somewhat true ?

20090310015210AAZX7oZ	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Questions on the 'Amistad' case (pls help me asap!!)?	Okay, I have to write an essay answering these questions:      - What evidence is there to suggest that the Supreme Court’s “Amistad” decision had a major effect on public opinion and helped hasten the arrival of the Civil War?       - How might the “Amistad” case have contributed to the abolition of slavery?      I personally hate the questions....   i mean.. it's not really THE Amistad case that abolished and changed views of slavery... it was happening gradually and the Amistad case was just an event in its process.      i don't really understand how I am supposed to respond to these questions. Please help!!

20090310022227AAHye3z	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you look at my speech?	Hi my speech is on genetic modification. Can you guys look at it and tell me if you like it or not so far? It is not finished. and thanks or your time :D   .........................................      Have you ever dreamt of having a child who looks like Harry Potter? Well it is no longer considered magic but it is very much in the face of reality. Yes you can make you child look like Batman or superman and they could break through metal walls and flying with X-ray vision and saving the world from destruction. OK maybe not that far but you get what I mean. Yes this ‘magic’ is called Genetic modification or genetic engineering. It is possible to make your children look like Tom Cruise; Genetic Modification goes so far that scientists say that they can give a brain which is as smart as Albert Einstein. Can you believe it; you can have someone who looks like Paris Hilton with the brain of Einstein! You are probably thinking that this is too good to be true and that I am probably lying but let me explain to you what Genetic Modification is and the many advantages it brings along with the many problems it may create in the future.      Genetic Modification! The name says it all, it a bit like cloning except for some difference. With cloning you can make someone look identical to their parents. But Genetic Modification can change the characteristics of a living organism or you can even remove bad genes which run in the family, for example cancer, heart disease and eye-sight problems. Plants and animals can be given characteristics. To do this they change the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. If they want to put in a specific gene, the use a gene gun, it fires microscopic bullets; no these are not life-threatening bullets coated with gunpowder but ones coated in foreign DNA into a plant or embryo, embryo is just another fancy name for a fertilized egg. The foreign DNA combines with the host’s DNA and alters the host’s genetic make-up.      Simple, isn’t it? This technology allows us to physically change the appearance or any genes of a plant or animal. It brings with it many advantages. Genetic Modification is becoming very popular in plants and mainly is aimed at crop production. Using genetic modification they can improve the quality of the crops like flavour, appearance and nutritional value. They can also increase the tolerance of the crops, like less need for water. Genetic modification food supporters say that Genetic engineering is essential in feeding the worlds population. The reasons for this is that in countries where the soil is poor using GM they can make the crops grow in those conditions and can make summer crops grow in winter.

20090310014054AAVje7a	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I drop out of High-School?	Well first off, I'm a year 13 at a New Zealand private school (which is our equivalent to a USA senior I think?) and I already know that when I leave school I want to study fashion design.       There is a college near my current school which offers a foundation arts course (because I haven't taken an year 12 art course, which I would need to get into an art school) for 17 year olds who have left. This would teach me a lot of general skills, and allow me to later on in the year to go on to projects more fashion specific. I would also have a portfolio at the end of the year to submit to other BFA courses.       This seems like a really good option, but I'm not sure if it would be the most practical choice. I really hate the idea of dropping out of high-school, as I kind of feel like I'd be giving up, but my school doesn't offer any courses fashion related, and I don't feel like I 'belong' in most of my classes. At the moment I'm working towards getting my English and Geography A levels, but I'm not doing particularly well, it seems like I'm just wasting my time.        I do really like my school however, It's an amazing place and I'm not keen to leave that environment and my friends, before I have to. If I left I'd also miss out on things like my Senior ball and the Production, and I would be losing touch with alot of people.      As much as I love it though, because it's a Private school, My mum is paying 15 thousand a year for me to be there, and I feel guilty staying even though I know I'm not getting anything out of it.        By the way, I do have New Zealand University enterance, and If I had wanted to, I could have gone to Uni this year, so I wouldn't be leaving with nothing.       Any input would be very, very much appreciated, I'm quite lost at the moment.      Thanks! :)
