They all get along except with one person who appears to be a control freak and wants to do things her way or no way. She completely defies my authority by ignoring what I ask her and the other workers to do, and thinks she can take her breaks and lunches whenever she wants, even though we are all obligated to stick to a schedule. It has become blatantly obvious she is not a team player at all, she just refuses to cooperate with me or anyone else in the group, whom she constantly puts down. To make things worse her desk is right next to mine so I can hardly get any work done because she constantly needs attention and questions answered.  I don't mind answering questions but she just fires away every five minutes. I would tell my superiors but at my job no one does anything about that kind of thing because we are unionized and everyone is afraid someone will go to the union if you try to exercise authority.Any suggestions?

We went through a real estate agent.  The actual home owner met with us the day we looked at the house.. We then agreed on the deposit amount and the monthly rent amount and handed the real estate agent our check.. They then called and verified it. Everything was good.. Two weeks later I contacted the real estate agent about getting utilities turned on and that was taken care of.. All of my utiliteis will be turned on the friday feb 6th.. We drove by the house yesterday and there is someone else living in the house.. The real estate agent didnt know anything about it and neither did the land lord.. They think her daughter in law told someone they could move in with out talking to her first... Now for the question.. Legally does she have to let the other ppl live there since she knew nothing about it.. Does she have to make them move out so we can move? She wants us to live there not them.. And if she makes them move out does she have to give them 30 days to do it? And if not will we be able to get our deposit or anything back.. but we also dont have anywhere to live as of Feb 15th... What can I do???

20081003091858AAlf8jU	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	How long does it take for funds to become available with WAMU?	I just opened an account 2 days ago with Washington Mutual. I opened 2 checking accounts. 1 is for personal use such as writing checks, cashing checks etc, the other I made is for ebay so I can deposit my paypal money and withdrawl to paypal etc. Today I got paid by my employer. My question is, the payroll company is out of Texas and I live and bank here in Florida. If I deposit my payroll check today how long will it take for the funds to be available? Also out of curiosity how long does it take the bank to actually verify the funds? I am nervous about depositing it because I read somewhere they might put a hold on it for 7 days leaving me stranded. The check is for 2,194.67 someone let me know!!! Thanks

Es un tema del que nunca se habla en los trabajos y de eso se aprovechan precisamente los empresarios y a cada uno nos pagan una cosa distinta. Tanto mejor te vendes, tanto más cobras, aunque hagas el mismo trabajo que otros.   Me gutaría saber lo que se gana en los diferentes trabajos para saber si estoy cobrando más, menos o lo que debería cobrar por hacer mi trabajo o si simplemente me he equivocado de profesión.   Soy responsable de sistemas.

20061009183615AAfmppT	Business & Finance;Investing	How to reduce cost of investment?	I want to buy 20-30 stocks with my $10,000 and hold them for a year. But my broker is charging me $30 for each transaction. ie.. it will cost me $60 to buy and then sell one stock.. this takes away 6% of my earning in each stock.      Is there any way I can buy stocks for very little overhead cost (say 1%)? I am Canadian so I can't take advantage of the $4 fees which some brokers offers to Americans only. There're banks offering lower fees ($10/transaction) if I trade 30+ times a quarter. But I am not rich enough to be an active trader.      Any advise? (except dumping Canadian citizenship and apply for US PR:)
