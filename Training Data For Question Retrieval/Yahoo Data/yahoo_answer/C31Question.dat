The worst is that one guy does donuts at night at 2:30 on Fridays and odd times at night during the week. The noise of the screeching tires wakes me up at night and makes the neighborhood look bad. Plus my car is parked in the corner sometimes and I feel it might be hit someday. I see the same car doing it and can get the license plate if I need to. What course of action should I take.    1) I can call the police when it happens but it is so quick that I don't think they can catch him in the act so I don't bother   2) I can record them on camera from the corner of my house if I need to for evidence   3) Leave anonymous notes to neighbor asking them to stop   4) Track the car down and slash his tires then leave a note telling him to stop doing donuts.      The neighborhood is pretty dense and setup in a grid layout. I prefer not to leave nails on the road since it might endanger others. I left an email to district supervisor but have not gotten a response. I don't want to run out and tell him to stop since the neighbor and friends are still outside when this happens and I don't want to get into confrontations. My others neighbors generally keep to themselves so I don't know about talking about the issue with them since I don't want to raise any suspicion since I will probably slash the tires eventually.

We have been spending the last few months getting together all the papers and documents we need to have to apply for her Spousal Visa.   I will be taking all the stuff i need to take with me when i fly out.  MY BIGGEST fear is that when i get to immigration at the airport and say 'im here to get married' i am going to get a moody border officer who is going to either refuse me entry or at the very least keep me there for ages asking all kinds of questions.  My fiance lives in Ohio, there are no residency laws insisting that i have to live in state for any amount of time before we wed......the people at the probate court have said all i need to bring is a passport and my birth certificate.  I'm hoping that a caseful of evidence that it is my fiance who is relocating to the UK afterwards and proof from my employer that i'm returning to the UK after 2.5wks PLUS a return flight ticket will convince immigration that we are doing theings legally.......im just concerened that they will turn me round at the border.........i want to be 100% truthful with them........any opinions???

Blame Clinton and Bush. Now what can Obama do? Well, start spending trillions for a stop gap stimulus that commonsense says is an attempt to do just what Bush tried with his useless $150 stimulus that had absolutely effect. It was not detectable in the economy. Borrowed money wasted but owed plus interest. There is a pattern here and it is not good and makes no sense. Jobs drying up by the millions and unemployment spending shooting up. No, we will not wait until nothing is left to regroup. These are not professional, rationale decisions, these are shots in the dark and do not hit the mark. We are getting set up for a collosal diaster with people loading up with their bibles and guns and regrouping in the woods to wait them out, even when they bring in more and more labor and engineers to work for less. Super rich just want more cheaper replacements from other countries. Phasing out the long term expensive labor. Corporate welfare for their cronies and illegals working for slave labor. Cheap labor and displacement of those who get a decent wage. This wrong and immoral. I blame both Dems and Reps with identical agendas. The tradional work force cost too much so toss them. Kick them to the curb instead for doing R&D to engineer products people really want to buy. These arrogant SOBs have one solution, import cheaper workers. Plain and simple by bad, unimaginative managment like GM. Bad business and all this while jacking up boness and salaries out of reality. Anything goes with  these rats, just like Enron and concentrating on cutting expenses on he backs of labor. Eventually, there will blood and guts over these business decisions. These people are courting a massive revolt that will not turn back once the shooting starts. It will be too late then. We need the troops to come home and protect their friends and family, not the arrogant, greed politicians.

20090221021111AAbXIN3	Politics & Government;Military	When does leadership training start in the Army?	1st of all thank-you to everyone who has taken the time to give me information in past questions. So now that I have a little better understanding of the Army's rank structure. When in the Army do you start to receive leadership training? Is there a special school for it?    I am asking because I have a very close friend who is making the change from the Marines to the Army . As a Former Marine I have alot of misconceptions about the Army that I would like to correct. I understand that the Army and the Marine Corps are two very different beasts. In the Marine Corps leadership and advancement through the Ranks go hand in hand. All Marines are taught to be leaders. So I thought that is how it works in every branch. But what has been explained to me is that leadership in the army does not start till specialist. Why is that?       Please don't answer if you are going to start a fight or say something negative about EITHER branch. I don't care to hear who is better or why my friend is smart or stupid for switching branches. We are all on the same side.      And no it is not me who is making the change.

I am bewildered by American politics, I have this idea that most of the people who protest, who make the loudest noise on the internets aren't really informed or well-read enough to make some of the opinions they are making. I'm guessing that many get their information from very biased sources, either liberal or conservative.      The Republicans and the Democrats cannot agree based on differing viewpoints, and instead of thinking of what is best for their country, they are thinking about their party policies.      I have been trying to read up on the news about what is happening in America, instead of getting an objective viewpoint from a single source, I usually find polarized opinions by reporters instead of economists or scientists.

Mark Sanford on why he thinks he opposed the stimulus.          “The governor of Louisiana expressed opposition. Has the highest African-American population in the country. Governor of Mississippi expressed opposition. The governor of Texas, and the governor of South Carolina. These four governor’s represent states that are in the black belt.

I live in a community where there have been very few foreclosures at all in the last ten years or more. We are a modest community, most all are homeowners, who work hard for little money, but most everyone around here lives within our means, and hardly anyone around here is in any danger of losing their house through foreclosure. The community income ranges from working class to lower middle class. Almost everyone around here supports the bailout though.      I also have many friends and family members who also own homes, but fall more in the upper middle class income brackets, and yet again, none of whom I know who are in danger of losing their homes through foreclosure because they weren't living beyond their means either. All of the people I know who fall in this class oppose the bailout.       What is your position?
20090203073323AA3s1lh	Politics & Government;Military	Need someone who really knows Army info who can help...?	Hi there!  Let me explain my situation and hopefully someone can help because I'm sick of getting the "i don't know" answers from my chain of command and branch...      I re-enlisted at the end of 2007 and got K9 on my contract.  I was suppose to go to K9 school that coming March but got pregnant Feb 2008.  So I got stuck in Germany at my company because if I would of went to a new duty station then the company would of had to pay for me to go to K9. (so i was told by my re-enlistment ssg)  So I stayed in Germany and had the baby in sept 2008.  Well after you have the baby you have 6 months till you can take a PT test.  For me to go to k9 i would have to pass a PT test.  I can't take a PT test until March 28th and my deros is april 4th.  (not enuff time right?)  Well...I've come to terms with it and decided to waive off my K9 and just pcs out of here.  I know I won't pass the PT test so to save time I asked to get my k9 waived and not to do it.        My question is:  My company is leaving by the end of this year and going back to the states because where we are at is closing down.  So everyone had to put down whether they wanted to go sum where else in europe or go back to the states with the company.  Well my platoon sgt told me that I'm basically PCSing and get to pick where I want to go.  So I put down for Hawaii.      NOW my question is:  since the company is leaving, what are the chances that i get my choice of station now that I gave up on my k9 school?        if you have any advice I would really appreciate it.  It's better then getting the "idk" from my chain of command and branch.  branch won't even look into my situation until my k9 is lifted off and there's not that much time from now til my deros.

20090221052739AAZIxcO	Politics & Government;Elections	President Obama is finally helping us on this terrible economy.  He says the average household will take home?	an average of 65 dollars more a month!!  Wow that's amazing 65 dollars more a month!  What will I be able to do with 65 dollars?  Woo hoo, maybe buy a new crack pipe!  Hmm lets see how many cases of beer will that buy me?   If I get the cheap stuff, probably quite alot!  So now I feel much better.  I was begining to get pissed off seeing the market lose 2000 points since his Ignauguration knowing that my investments are now worth ......hmm lets see.... about 65 dollars a month!  And all the while seeing Mr. Obama talk doom and gloom as if he wanted the markets to continue to tank!   I also was concerned at how the spending package will cause inflation and give the federal government more control over my life, but then who cares because I will probably be one of the masses with my hand out asking for government help now.  Did anyone see my crack pipe?  I set it down and now I can't find it...oh well let me get back on point.  Ya know I was also concerned that the spending package would raise our debt tremendously and cause future generations to struggle under the burden of this massive loan.  I got over that though because I realized that I may very well be dead before any of that happens so what do I care?  Ha-ha Barack old buddy you really are a visionary, I would never have thought you really are looking out for people like me!!!  Now here is the best thing about all of this.  Right now I pay about 14K in federal taxes.  Pretty soon I will be getting a tax rebate and I won't even be working!!!!! How great is that?  That is what it will be like living in Obama-nation.

20090221052019AAnjUR7	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I Need Some Legal Advice Please!!!!?	My mother, my sister, and I just moved into these apartments 2 weeks ago, and last night my mother received a letter saying that she is to immediately move out because the terms of the lease had been violated. So my mother called the owner and the landlord told her that my mother said she was going to be the only person living in the apartment, but on the application my mother wrote both me and my sister's name down as other tenants and i was there with my mother when she payed her money and i even picked up the key, and the landlord told her that she never looked at the application, how can she tell someone their lease has been violated  when she never looked at her application to see if its true how would that hold up in court and what kind of landlord won't look at the application when someone is moving into their property she even spelled my mother's name wrong on the court letter. She just loves money. they also have noticed children here everyday and a strange guy walking up and down the street and she explained that my brother  has been helping us move furniture in and we have needed someone to be here while the cable and telephone people come because my mother works and both me and my sister are in school, and in the afternoon my oldest sister needs someone to baby sit while her and her husband works but they pick them up when they get off work so they don't stay here. the landlord said that  was ok, but my mother just told her she would be the only one  staying her, but her application has both me and my sis name on it, so can she put her out for that. Can we get a lawyer, if so what kind?

I have always been a very law abiding individual, with no criminal or any other triple on my record. However, this year, my sister and I had an argument, she was so angry and she called cops. I spent one day in jail and was release with NO bailout. I was charged with domestic assault. In my court day, my sister was with me, she was not charging me anything, but the MN state prosecutor asked me weather if I want my case to be continued one year with no guilty entered in my record. That means if I'm not charged again during this year then the case will dismiss. I accepted because I didn't’t wanted my case to be long and I couldn't’t afford a lawyer .Anyway, my sentencing order is that the matter is continued one year without judgment of guilty. Also, the judge ordered payment of $150 which I paid .My sentencing order also says that I shall remain law abiding and not be charged with/convicted of any same or similar violations within one year. I' m wondering if that will affect my citizenship. Please help me understand .Thanks for your answers.

Back when Ron Paul was running for the Republican nomination for President, his supporters were all over the place espousing the Libertarian viewpoint. Something that struck me was how there was a Libertarian solution for just about every problem we faced; which I actually found kinda suspicious since no philosophy is 100% correct.   At any rate, in the global recession heading for depression we have now, what would a President Paul have done (other than saying 'Told ya so!')? Certainly not a huge Stimulus Package like Obama is advocating. In fact, I don't envision him doing much of anything (I could be wrong of course). Would we be prepared to deal with the consequences of that, how would it help? I'm not saying the current strategy WILL work, but I don't see how letting the global economy go down the toilet ( what conservatives call a 'Correction') would be the best choice.      p.s.- Read this:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comme...  if you're not scared already, you should be.

We probably need to vote all of them out of office    and send them back to school to learn history!    We pay more to illegal's in welfare than it would cost to deport them!    Our career politicians need to work for the voters    and the good of the United States of America , not the lobbyist and big business.          HOOVER , TRUMAN AND EISENHOWER       Here is something that should be of great interest    for you to pass around.    I didn't know of this until it was pointed out to me.       Back during The Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover    o rdered the deportation of ALL illegal aliens    in order to make jobs available to American citizens    that desperately needed work.      Harry Truman deported over two million Illegal's after WWII    to create jobs for returning veterans.       And then again in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower    deported 13 million Mexican nationals!    The program was called 'Operation *******'    so that American WWII and Korean veterans    had a better chance at jobs.    It took 2 Years, but they deported them!       Now, if they could deport the illegal's back then,    they can sure do it today!!       lf you have doubts about the veracity of this information,    enter Operation ******* into your favorite search engine    and confirm it for yourself.       Reminder.    Don't forget to pay your taxes...    12 million Illegal Aliens are depending on you.

20090219173737AAFP8Jl	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	My political science teacher believes we should become more of a socialist country, your thoughts?	He says that medicine should be controlled by the government.  His argument is that medicine is failing, in that we're 17th in the world for birthing, and that we provide other emergency services through government like protection, firefighting, education, etc etc.      My argument is that the government wouldn't be able to handle it, and if anything they would only make the situation worse.  I believe they need to step in and set medicine on the straight path, (like they're currently doing with the economy) but I do not believe that they should take over health care.  Before they even think of taking over health care, shouldn't they prove that they can provide the other services effectively?      Our public education system is failing.  Bottom line.  Our firefighters are doing their job, but crime rate hasn't exactly gone below most other industrialized countries rates.  We have a social security system with a huge flaw that they have no idea how to get out of.  We're in a war that has no end in sight.      First things first I say, and by the rate it's going, the government will never be ready to take on the medical industry.  Your opinions?

20090219174439AAcKTtf	Politics & Government;Government	Do we need to license politicians?	Think about it, to be a hairdresser or a daycare operator you must be licensed. Attornies, doctors, land surveyors, engineers and even plumbers must be certified. You have to pass a test to work for the post office, become a teacher or even drive a car.     But what about politicians? They have some of the most important responsibilities in society yet to be one you simply need to be voted in. No tests to prove you know anything about economics, laws or even gov't! Heck, technically you can be illiterate and not be able to add but still get elected right?     Why not have both parties get together with some other intelligent people and come up with some certification tests for politicians? In order to be eligible to be elected, you have to pass a basic competency test. Then we can be reasonably assured that our politicians have at least a modicum of common sense and knowledge.     Why should my mailman have to pass a test while my senator who spends my paycheck can be ignorant?    What do you think?

I don't have a missing toe or anything, I just want to know if that is considered a disability or is it considered an impairment under Americans with Disabilities Act definition.      The ADA defines "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual."      Obviously, a missing toe will not keep a person from working a job (No job that I can think of at least). So, the question: is a person who has a missing toe covered under the ADA, OR no, because it's an impairment under ADA definition?      So, if an employer says "No, I won't hire you because you have a missing toe," can the person file discrimination under the ADA?

So, a lot of this money from the stimulus package is basically "handouts", they just don't want to use that word. And these handouts will be spent (not invested, spent) in ways that won't actually benefit the economy. The "tax cuts" are going mostly to people who don't PAY taxes anyway. How can you give someone a tax cut when they don't pay? It's a HANDOUT.    Also, I'm relatively young in the work force. But one day, I want to retire, and I want to get social security. If they stop taking social security taxes out of my and everyone else's paychecks - how will I get that social security.      And where is all of this money coming from? Why is it that when Bush has a deficit it was evil-money-monger but when Obama is planning on increasing our deficit by handing out money, its a "stimulus package"?   Does anyone believe that this will make a large majority of our population dependent on government money - money which they will spend just as carelessly as they have done recently? And what is he doing to help the private sector?

Hello,         I am seriously suffering very bad with my time in the Marine Corps. I have been in for 8 months and I am stil in school. I have given it all I can to make it and give my all to this but I cant do it anymore. I physically and mentally can handle no more so please do not reply to this telling me to suck it up.       I recently tried to get help because of my extreme anxiety, distress, panic attacks and depression. I was not helped during my first few visits to the military hospital so I saw an outside physiciatrist and he diagnosed me with major depresion. i have been to the ER serveral times having severe panic attacks and I was later referred by a deployment health commander back to the naval hospitals mental health with a recommended administrative seperation.  I was then taken to San Diego to the phyciatic unit where i stayed for nearly two weeks. I saw another naval doctor and was again recommended for an expidious administrative seperation for adjustment disorder (that makes two of the same) and I was told my command had agreed to it but I had to return to base to begin the process. I have been here two days..and i was dropped from my classes to a platoon to wait it but I really cant take this anymore and need to get out of here asap for my own well being and mental state. I cannot recover in these conditions and I am deteriorating daily despite my best efforts to widthstand it.      My father is contacting an attorney in attempts to speed this process up and get me out of here immidiately but I truly feel helpess in knowing what to do. My father has and the attorney have suggested either writing my home state congressman or senators in an effort for intervention in getting this done RIGHT NOW. I am however terrified that my command will take that out on me in turn for seeking help above them. What good could getting an attorney that specializes in military law do in terms of intervening and speeding things up? additionally, who should my father write to? senators or congressman? I really need to stop torturing myself and escape this mental torment but there is no one to turn to here and i truly don't think anyone that i would go to cares. please help

20090219173931AAcoSyd	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Is this really a law?	I hope that someone can shed some light on something that happened to a friend of mine. I never knew that the thing he did was an offense, and yet he was ticketed for it. I'd like to know more about this so that I can make sure that I never do anything like this in the future. Okay, here it is (I wish I could draw this out to make it easier, but of course, I can't):       A friend of mine was driving one day in one direction on a huge, long street. On this huge, long street, he had stopped at a business that he was considering buying, and after looking at it, he exited the parking lot of the business, and put on his left blinker to signal that he wanted to get over to the far left lane. He was safely able to get into the far left lane. Then, he says that he turned into a church. He exited the parking lot of the church and proceeded to travel in the opposite direction of the business that he first stopped at.       The second he exited the parking lot of the church, a police officer stopped him. The officer said that he stopped my friend because he used private property (the church) as a roadway; the officer gave him a ticket. He said that he should have proceeded to the next light and made a turn, instead of pulling into private property to do so.       This really got me to thinking. I just want to know has anyone heard of anything like this? If you have, can you explain more about it.

My boyfriend lives in China and he disparately wants to get here, but we have no idea how to make that possible. I know there are fiance visas and you can come here for school, but non of those work. He can't afford to come here for school and marriage is a huge thing. We arn't going to get engaged just so he can get here. One option he has is to wait for a open opportunity to come here with his college hes currently attending, but if he gets the chance he won't be here for long at all.   Does anybody know any other options!!! I would greatly appreciate it.   THANKS A LOT! : )   PS: Do you think if someone here wanted him for work he could get here?

20090219175111AAtoJVO	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Who should be pointing the finger at the Washington Post?	I voted for Obama.  I read the comic strip. I Laughed, It wasn't until the racist accusations poured in that I saw the strip in that way.  I assumed It was Republican Police taking a shot at Democrats.  What I find to be racist is not a comparison of a Black man to a monkey especially when I can't recollect that comparison being used in my life time of 30 years.  What is racist to me is segregation.  For example a Black Entertainment Television, or a Black History Month.  The Highest office is currently held by a Black Man.  This is cause for celebration, and should be an end to the "Black Card" being used.  I personally believe this is a method used to obtain power for argument purposes, and promulgates more hate and racism through ignorant means.  When I argue I do not argue on behalf of all Italians, I simply point the finger and say I don't like you because I simply don't like you.  It is time to end racism in our country and stop spreading it.  So if you are going to point fingers and throw stones make sure your not hoping onto a bandwagon for sheep, and disguising the devil.

20090203094939AA4e75C	Politics & Government;Government	Do these stimulus packages feel like we are rewarding bad behavior and punishing good behavior?	I am talking about Bush and Obama's stimulus plans.       If you run your business into the ground or over extend yourself in a mortgage then the government is going to give you a hand-out.      If your business is successful and you have paid your mortgage on time then the government will give you a pat on the back and probably raise your taxes to pay for these stimulus packages.       Does this not seem fundamentally flawed? Where is the incentive to preform better if you can fail, by your own mistakes, and the government will step in to bail you out.

20090203095008AAnSDgG	Politics & Government;Politics	Serious question about Obama ?	Okay, a lot of people are asking questions about some of Obama's elected officials that have had previous scandals whether they be the lawyer that gives/gave advice to terrorist or the guys not paying taxes.       Anyway, a lot of the responses I see say something along these lines      "well bush....(fill in the blank)"   or    "well remember Enron.....etc etc et..."      okay my question is this: by comparing Obama to past presidential scandals aren't you just reinforcing the fact that he too is just as corrupt? I mean your not really defending the guy by doing that your just making excuses why it should be okay-basically like saying well he hit me first so I punched him back so it's even.       Bush wasn't running on a campaign that declared he was holier then thou & marketed with the slogan "change we can believe in"....So what people are saying is that Obama is no more of a change from Bush (once we get past the race aspect of course)          & no Im not anti-Obama at all-I just think it's funny that that is how people try to justify things

A thought came to mind while I was thinking about how there are so many different opinions on politics these days, and I thought maybe things would be better if someone in california couldn't dictate what goes on in florida.  In other word would things be better if the federal government were less involved and only kept the state governments from being involved in other states issues?  For example if you want a social liberal economy in your state you can have it but it wouldn't be aloud to dictate other states.  I know I'm fed up with someone who is in another state deciding what goes on in my life, and I'm sure there are others, no matter what your ideology is.

20090219180734AAmhLdI	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	For those who claim the NY Post cartoon is racial?	You do realize the cartoon actually isn't racist, right? Reading the cartoon and understanding the political system would allow someone to understand what the true point of the cartoon was.      However, I fear people merely saw the cartoon of two cops shooting a chimp, equated chimp with a racial slander against black Americans, and saw the word stimulus and immediately cried "racism".      However, reading the cartoon caption would clear up everything.      Cop: "They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill"      Writing a bill is the action of Congress, not the action of the President. By specifying "write", the artist was taking a jab at Pelosi - who oversaw the majority of the writing of the bill and shut out Republicans from putting anything in. He was also implying a chimpanzee could've written the stimulus bill.      Now, if the cop had said "They'll have to find someone else to SIGN the next stimulus bill", I'd agree that it was racial.      All in all, I feel that anyone who is making an issue of this being racial is merely hiding their own racist leanings. And yes, that includes Al Sharpton.
