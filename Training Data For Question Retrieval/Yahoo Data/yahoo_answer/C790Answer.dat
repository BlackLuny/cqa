RJpekNPfaa	Well you could "turn yourself off", by telling yourself how bad commercial ice-cream is for you:<br>  <br>  “It is not uncommon for commercially produced ice cream to be made without any of the three basic building blocks from which ice cream originates ~ eggs, cream, and sugar. <br>  <br>  Instead it will often include an entire pantry of synthetic flavours, sweeteners, stabilizers, and preservatives.  <br>  <br>  To compete with the flavour and texture of full-fat ice creams, commercial low-fat ice creams (which incorporate a larger percentage of air) must substitute synthetic emulsifiers to keep them smooth and other artificial thickeners to make up for the loss of creamy texture.<br>  <br>  It seems that the ingredients deemed suitable for use in ice cream become more bizarre as time goes by. Unilever, the largest producer of ice cream in the U.S., recently introduced a genetically-modified "anti-freeze" protein derived from the blood of a polar ocean fish.  <br>  <br>  This protein, when used in the ice cream making process, imitates the smooth and creamy texture of real ice cream without incorporating any of the confection’s real ingredients. <br>  <br>  Such "breakthroughs" in technology appeal to the consumer - who can seemingly enjoy the pleasure of real ice cream without any of the guilt - as well as the manufacturer, who profits from using cheaper ingredients of lower quality. <br>  <br>  But such short term solutions are detrimental both to human health and to that of the planet and the other life forms that it supports.  <br>  <br>  Many commercial ice creams are made with milk from cows raised by dairy producers that administer large doses of artificial growth hormones and antibiotics, and that provide feed heavily laden with pesticides”.<br>  <br>  Read full article here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://greenlivingideas.com/ice-cream/ice-cream-returns-to-the-natural-basics.html" rel="nofollow">http://greenlivingideas.com/ice-cream/ic...</a><br>  <br>  You should make your own homemade ice-cream; at least you know what is in it. <br>  <br>  You don’t even need a fancy ice-cream making machine, I use to use a spoon for the stirring / churning part. <br>  <br>  Homemade ice-cream is utterly sensational………very addictive. <br>  <br>  And the variety of flavours is only limited by your imagination.<br>  <br>  A few years ago, I made an utterly sensational caramelised pumpkin ice-cream.<br>  <br>  I can’t remember the exact ingredients but it was very basic, somewhere along the lines of:<br>  <br>  Tin of evaporated milk<br>  Egg yolks<br>  Brown sugar<br>  Vanilla bean pods<br>  Fresh pureed pumpkin<br>  <br>  These recipes look similar: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhg.com/recipe/ice-cream/pumpkin-ice-cream/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhg.com/recipe/ice-cream/pump...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Pumpkin-Ice-Cream-138641" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Pumpkin-Ice-Cr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://mikes-table.themulligans.org/2008/11/15/spiced-pumpkin-ice-cream/" rel="nofollow">http://mikes-table.themulligans.org/2008...</a><br>  <br>  Here are more homemade ice-cream ideas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhg.com/recipes/searchResults.jsp?start=1&searchType=text&resultsType=recipe&resultCategory=kitchen&_requestid=91146" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhg.com/recipes/searchResults...</a><br>  <br>  YUMMY.<br>  <br>  .|`|k5RVJxliaa	Drink cold water or pepsi or anything like juice but really cold mayb thtat would help or i have an idea get a ice tray and pour your favorite kind of juice in the ice tray and freeze it and after it is frozen for a little while stick a toothpick in it and put it back in the freezer and aafter eat it!

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Yes there are, and I'm sure they don't hold a candle to what is available in England.<br>  <br>  Many fast food restaurants have fish and chips, although the "fish" is going to be the same kind of chopped and reconstituted white fish that is in fish sticks and fish sandwiches. Restaurants like this include Long John Silvers and Jack in the Box. These should be avoided unless you like fish sticks.<br>  <br>  There are a handful of restaurants that specialize in fish and chips. There is one down the street from me (called amazingly enough "Fish And Chips") that serves actual battered and fried fish. There is another place a bit away from me, that is actually part restaurant and part fish monger, so they have very fresh and delicious fish. They make very delicious fish and chips, including some very American versions like salmon and chips. British-style pubs probably serve fish and chips as well.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	There are some fast food seafood places that proclaim that title but the best rendition of the British fish and chips comes from local pubs and taverns.|`|vtixxvU0aa	im pretty sure Ruby's diner has 'em, with a propa white lightning! lol just kidding but yeah they do|`|Pdex43zgaa	No. Not like in London. <br>  <br>  When I visited London I had no idea there were so many.

f2d9c213ef900a74f5759771f3fb61a7aa	I would say it is not instinct or a natural reaction but  rather from Environment and influence from Parents . When you are hungry , yes you want to eat that is  instinct and your brain . <br>  Eating meat is taught to you when you are little , you are fed it and get used to eating it . You are also taught about animals like Old McDonald's farm ; even play games and toys with farm animals .<br>  <br>  If you tell a child who understands what a pig or chicken or cow is and then ask them if they want to eat that animal they will say NO .. They see it as an animal not food , but as time goes by the animal is basically disguised as a cute nugget , hot dog , shaped into burgers etc etc . They no longer make the connection that they are eating an Animals body .<br>  I have seen this as my sons who were raised vegan , once in kindergarten telling the other children who were eating burgers, that they were eating a dead cow . The children stating yelling and argued , when he convinced them it actually was..No children wanted to eat it ( yes a call from the Principal)<br>  My mouth never waters if I see meat , in fact I am usually rather repulsed and many times Lose my appetite .I am not conditioned to eat meat , neither is my family who reacts the same as I do to meat .<br>  So yes I would say it is conditioning from Parents , School , Media including tons of Ads like Burger king, Wendy's etc .. and Not instinct . Instinct is survival and we do not need meat to survive .<br>  Just my view<br>  <br>  Vegan Forever|`|8dfca7e2b1f09cef17816b68835e11f5aa	I think vegetarians/vegans are more enlightened people to begin with; more compassionate and broader thinking. <br>  I was raised eating a lot of different things but now the smell of some of those things cooking can make me sick to my stomach, especially fish! We ARE trained as children to eat things and that they "taste good". We're told it's "beef" not that cow and "venison" not Bambi. Some parents even lie to their kids about fish being chicken. If everyone who ate meat went to a slaughter house there would be a LOT more vegetarians!|`|khXGGBiTaa	Interesting question. I wish I had a definitive answer for you.<br>  <br>  All I know is that it doesn't appeal to me in the least. I've been a vegetarian for a third of a century so far. Some of the smells repulse me more than others. Especially some of the strong fishy smells which, if severe enough, can make me gag. There's a really foul variety of dried fish that some Fijian Indians seem to love, and it has to be one of the worst smells you could ever experience in your life. Whenever I see or smell tuna, I don't instantly think "edible" - my mind automatically goes down the track of "cat food" (Call me weird, but it does!). Going past the "meat" section of the supermarket, my eyes scan for "reduced for quick sale" labels and I don't think along the lines of "That would be great for dinner tonight" - instead I think "The dog would love that" or "No, the dog won't eat that".|`|sMTVcfiVaa	I don't know if it's the meat itself or just the thought of a well-cooked and flavorful meal. I'm a vegetarian (9 yrs) and I admit that if I smell a bbq, steak or chicken being cooked, I will salivate. It's not because I WANT to eat meat, it just smells like a delicious meal.<br>  <br>  So I don't know. I think it's just that it's food and food is almost always appealing to the human brain.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	i think it does have something to do with your mind, but not in the way you think.<br>  im a vegan but when i look at meat i still find it appetizing, but i know better than to eat it because its wrong, in my opinion.<br>  i think most people look at meat and don't find it disgusting because it has always just been something we were brought up on and so we always found it appetizing. eating meat has just always been something accepted.<br>  its like someone who has always eaten frogs legs thinks yummy when they see them but then someone who has never had it often finds that gross.<br>  <br>  that's just my opinion i don't know if it really answers your question or what, but there you go.
AA10351134	The giant lollopops are great props, stick them into any centerpiece-type container, or even into a cake if you're having one. You can get foil balloons that look like actual candy on ebay for cheap. One of the cutest ideas I've seen is to take those round japanese paper lanterns, and wrap them in a long piece of cellphane, tying off both ends like a hard candy.

AA11610779	I've never tried that, but you can try to find it in the Chinese area, which is in the 13th arrondissement, especially between l'Avenue de Choisy, l'Avenue d'Ivry and le boulevard périphérique (it's a large road that goes around Paris). It forms a triangle. Just look it up on the map. I'm not sure you'll find it there, but that's where you're more likely to find it.<br>  <br>  Soybean is called "soja" or "graine de soja". In case you don't speak French, you can ask them that: "Je cherche de l'Edamame, ce sont des graines de soja cuites dans l'eau bouillante avec du sel et parfois d'autres condiments et qui sont servies telles quelles" (I looked up what Edamame was on Wikipedia.)<br>  <br>  Hope you find it!

You say you have left over veggies? Cooked or uncooked? What kind? Peppers? Onions? If they are already cooked, just reheat them with a little butter. If they are uncooked, toss them with some olive oil, salt and pepper and either grill them or roast them in the oven at 450 degrees F.

TJOHxhEUaa	All these different sea salts, whether Celtic or French Fleur de Sel, are still just sea salt.  They might each have a slightly different look or a _very_ faintly different taste, but you'll never notice it once it's on food.  Get the less expensive stuff!|`|36a3ynpJaa	Gray salts have no nutritional advantage over sea salt but they are subtly more flavorful.   I don't think it's worth the extra money.|`|7b1d5447f72c26dfddad46cbc6b5ab07aa	The difference between the two lies in the procedure by which each is made. True Celtic Sea Salt is hand-harvested in special coastal salt pens along the coast of Brittany, France. Sea water is brought in to the pens, and then carefully allowed to slowly evaporate, leaving behind sea salt in its most natural and complete form (this includes all the ambient minerals and trace elements that you find in the sea water, including trace amounts of magnesium, which keeps the finished product slightly "moist").<br>  <br>  Other sea salts on the market are made by boiling the seawater until salt remains, but this process of boiling also removes many of the other minerals and trace elements, so this process yields a type of sea salt that's not nearly as complete as Celtic Sea Salt.<br>  <br>  I can tell you from personal taste testing that Celtic Sea Salt is wonderful - it has a rich pleasing taste to it. I use it on everything, I even dip a piece of chocolate in it and eat it. It isn't dry and powdery, like other salts on the market, and this is because it still retains a small amount of natural sea moisture due to magnesium's natural ability to absorb moisture. So, you know you have good, fresh Celtic Sea Salt when it appears slightly damp and "clumps" a bit in the salt box. (Make sure you store it in either an old-fashioned wooden salt box, or pure glass/ceramic container, never in metal or plastic, as those other minerals I mentioned can react with metal and muck up the taste!).<br>  <br>  Also, you can add Celtic Sea Salt to your bath water, because bathing in salts is good for your skin, and also, your body naturally absorbs the salts and minerals through your skin, and this is good for overall health. Taking a hot bath or soaking in a chlorinated hot tub actually drains salts from your body, which is why people often feel weak or even dizzy after stepping out of a hot bath. But add a few handfuls of Celtic Sea Salt, and you actually replenish and reinvigorate your system. (You can actually buy Celtic Sea Salt in 22 lb.bags, allowing you to add large amounts to your bath water).<br>  <br>  Be sure to check out my sources below. Good luck, and happy salting!
UIXKTaghaa	watching movies tends to be a little boring if you have friends who want to chat or play, and sport isn't for everyone so you need a mix of things that will appeal to all.<br>  <br>  How about running your own murder mystery and getting your guests to come as characters.  These are great fun, especially if everyone gets dressed up.  You can pick a theme and then theme the party around the mystery - it's good fun preparing and running.  Guests usually have a great time!<br>  <br>  If that's no good, what about cooking a meal together?  Or having a casino night in, get some poker chips and play some casino style games and see who wins.<br>  <br>  Mix your own mocktails rather than cocktails - they're just as tasty and you can have just as much fun.<br>  <br>  Have a themed party such as Bond, you might want to find a good Scene-it bond game, play bond music, watch a bond movie etc.  Or pick another theme.|`|FlMyCRUtaa	A huge fight.|`|zg82CYzIaa	HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY            HOUSE PARTY           HOUSE PARTY|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	You could do one of those who dunnit parties!

Not sure if that makes sense but I've been cooking awhile and tend to eyeball ingredients and don't measure much. I boil whatever noodles I have handy. Usually egg noodles.

To that add cream of mushroom or celery soup or both. Grate cheese to add to your soup and put noodles and tuna in with the sauce. I also like to use a little bit of dill weed. Add garlic and onion powder if you like and peas (canned or frozen) if you want more veggies. Cook till heated through. Easy, breezy. Enjoy.

DT2mU1jOaa	You are obviously an educated and intelligent person to be curious about brewing such a great beer. Yes it is difficult to brew but do not let that stop you from conducting your own trial brews.<br>  You must know that the rice needs to be milled very small/fine and gelatinized in a cereal cooker prior to being added to the main mash. This is because rice does not contain amylytic enzymes and its strach needs to be made ready or exposed to the enzymes of the mash.<br>  When it somes to beechwood aging this is for yeast-wort contact foe a more complete fermentation. You can accomplish this by circulating (agitating) your fermenting wort. The beechwood chips serve only for this fermentation purpose and contributes no flavor. It is an old practice amny brewers employed in days gone by and serve AB through marketing. It is labor and cost intensive to employ this method of yeast-aiding attenuation.<br>  You also need to use good German hops as Ab does with their beer. They use nothing but the highest quality of ingredients available on the private and commercial markets. Clone style yeast(s) are available also online or from most any brew shop.<br>  <br>  The Weatherman does pick and choose his words carefully, and knows very little of the reasons for using rice in beer.<br>  <br>  If the Weatherman can state his sources for the use of rice being for cost only it would lend cretance to his diatribe? But of course he cannot because it is deeper than that.<br>  <br>  I can easily speak on the behalf of DEA of anyone that is interested in being educated on beer for that matter. Today, I give a lesson to Weatherman. Rice is not a cheap ingredient for beer. Yes it like barley of any commodity has a fluctuating price and at any given time it may be cheaper or more costly than another given a certain set of circumstances. But rice/corm/wheat/ oats (just choose any) all have particular contribution to the product that they are utilized in. Rice indeed contributes flavors very light and subtle flavors indeed. <br>  DEA is correct that the German brewers in the USA did incorporate rice in the beers they brewed in the US. Perhaps if one was to read more carefully and stop interjecting into others words they could learn something.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Rice in American Pilsner is/was indeed a German brewer inception-fact!<br>  2. American-Pilsner is a world recognized beer style and has won many awards as well. It is anti-Ameirican (#@$%$^) that are in fear of this becoming, as it has, more popular in their countries.<br>  3. What a laugh. To hear/read such things from someone which has never worked in the beer industry and it shows. The above guy (s) speak with (I can not say) but a very large deficit on both beer knowledge and especially in the skills department of brewers. Yes indeed the automation in the larger segment lends to processing large mass flows to aid the brewer of which will become beer. But in a smaller scale,  craft brewers utilize the same. LMAO It goes beyond that. It goes into the knowledge of how to set parameters with the ingredients specifications and to adjust on the spot during the actual brewing. These are the knowledge-based skills the big brewers have over the little boys by far. Do the craft brewers do a good job? Yes they do. But they do not compare easily to those skills of the Anheuser Busch, Heinekens, SAB's of the world Just a fact no big deal really..<br>  <br>  " I find it curious that anyone can come down on an ale for containing wheat while praising Bud for using rice. Chaque un a son gout."<br>  Why? Others do the same with many other adjunct ingredients.<br>  Well I FIND it curious anyone can come down on Bud when brewing Miller Lite. Or that same person can condemn one rice beer over another. Chaque un a son gout.<br>  Wheat is an adjunct grain to the brewer. But should any grain be considered adjunct?<br>  <br>  Wheat was the "rice" of its day in Germany. It took some political wrangling to get its written into the German and "German only" food-beers laws. So many people overlook the the foolish decisions brewers make today in brewing beer with strange and unusual ingredients. [coffee, cocoa, spices, fruits (banana, grapes, others), millet, Sorghum, and many many others.] Is it a throw-back to earlier breweing days where freedom abounded for the brewer? Yes. Is it now that brewers today understand health and safety issues of brewing a food product? Yes. But certain people just can not and will not educate themselves on beer and beer/brewing history. The same people are just to entrenched into outdated and limited mind sets about anything especailly beer.<br>  <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Grains#Other_Grains" rel="nofollow">http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.p...</a>|`|ZGE8mvkpaa	YA will let anybody on here. Well it is not English rubbish beer no doubt.<br>  <br>  It takes a crew of skilled and educated workers to brew Budweiser. Many hold chemical engineering and biology degrees.<br>  The beer is processed as any other beer basically but it takes an extra step in utilizing rice as a grain source. What to know about this type of  beer is understanding that the rice serves several functions from fermentable sugar source to lighter body and refreshing taste. It came into use from German brewer-immigrants back in the 19th century and has gained a greater percentage in the total grain usage over the years.<br>  <br>  The rice is first made gelatinous in a cereal cooker then added to the main mash. The brewing then commences as in any other lager beer. During the fermentation of Budweiser beer beechwood chips are used. This once was a more common practice of many brewers and is used today mainly for marketing purposes. What the wood chips do (and only this) is add a greater surface area to allow the yeast to be better exposed to the fermenting wort.<br>  You are correct to say it is difficult to brew. The skill involved must be superior as off flavor can easily be detected unlike many European and US craft beers which usually hide their mistakes" in all the excess and unbalanced flavor. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wheat beers are not real beer as it uses cheap wheat which is an adjunct.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	Quite simple.<br>  <br>  You get a normal lager recipe.<br>  <br>  Throw out half of the real ingredients, and replace them with cheap rubbish like rice.<br>  <br>  Only brew it 3/4 as far as it should be brewed, then artificially kill the yeast.<br>  <br>  Refuse to store it properly, instead drink it way to early (after all who cares that the word LAGER actually refers to the fact that is is stored before drinking to develop flavour)<br>  <br>  Seriously, if you want a cool, refreshing, beer look for a Weizen recipe and brew that instead.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Nice to see DEA picks and chooses his words carefully, and knows little of the reasons for using rice.<br>  <br>  An adjunct is ANY non malted grain added to beer.<br>  <br>  1) Rice did not get to America via German brewers, they are not allowed to use it is Germany because of the Reinheitsgebot (German beer purity laws) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsge...</a><br>  <br>  2) Wheat Beer (Weizen in Germany) is a recognised beer style world wide, and the wheat used is NOT an adjunct in that style of beer, but an integral ingredient. IT is there to provide better head retention, and add a slight sour/tartness to the beer. (Hoegaarden, Pauliner, Schneider, Bernard etc are some award winning Wheat Beers .... award winning being something ABs poor version of Czech Budweiser will never do outside the USA)<br>  <br>  Using his argument oats are only an adjunct to oatmeal stouts, but the same as wheat in wheat beers are there for taste reasons, not purely to save money.<br>  <br>  3) Rice was added by AB to their beer because it IS a cheap adjunct and is purely there to make production cheaper (strange for something that calls itself a premium beer). The only real effect it has on the product is to make it lighter in colour.<br>  <br>  4) IT takes more skill to make AB Bud than a craft brew as off flavours  are hidden in craft brewed beers - I don't think so, AB, and all hugely mass produced beers worldwide, are automated, so take no brewing skills at all, it also takes no skill to make bland beer time after time. Craft brewers hand make their beers, and show their skill by turning out the same beer time after time, they also show it in developing new beers, of many different styles.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	I'll skip the obvious question of why you would want to and get to it. You can get clone recipes on the <a href="http://byo.com" rel="nofollow">http://byo.com</a> website. I think that they have one for Bud. If that is the style you like, Papazian has a book of gold medal clones. That is, he cloned all the gold medal winners that particular year. I have brewed the Miller Lite clone, which my wife likes, and the Dos Equis clone, which we both like. Either is a good "lawnmower beer". Both use pilsner yeast, as I recall. I still prefer a good hefeweisen, no matter what any Bud shill says. I find it curious that anyone can come down on an ale for containing wheat while praising Bud for using rice.

It tastes decent (not great), leaves you in pain in the belly.  Mostly cramping, though if you get enough it can get much worse than cramping.  Nothing poisonous or anything, you just need a hardy stomach to deal with it.

F77AfkUIaa	Ignore the previous person.<br>  <br>  I am an avid hookah smoker (at least once a day).<br>  <br>  Here's a diagram to help out with part terms: <a href="http://www.hookahshisha.com/images/hookah_setup_diagram.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.hookahshisha.com/images/hooka...</a><br>  <br>  The water in the base should cover about an inch of the stem. I personally like cold water better, maybe even with ice cubes (if you can fit them in through the base opening).<br>  <br>  The tobacco (or shishah) should be put into the bowl loosely, but filled up to the rim. <br>  <br>  Then, place a piece of tinfoil that will cover the top of the bowl and then some taut across. Scrunch the rest around the bowl so that the top stays tight. <br>  <br>  We then usually use a toothpick to get the holes in the tinfoil. The holes should be fairly little and pretty evenly spaced.<br>  <br>  As far as the coal goes, it can differ from type to type. If you're using a more commonly used coal (like Pharoah's or Three King's), then, holding it with your tongs, light it using a lighter or your stove burner . Gently (I do mean gently!) blow on the bottom of the coal until the entire bottom of it is glowing reddish. <br>  <br>  Lastly, place the coal on the tinfoil.<br>  <br>  It will probably take a minute or two to get the smoke going.<br>  <br>  The only other thing to know is that you might want to move the coals as the smoking gets too hot or too cold. Also, using the tongs or the small bar hanging off your tongs (if you have that type of tongs), you'll want to push off excess ash off the coals. The excess ash can prevent the coal's heat from reaching the shishah and the rest of the hookah.<br>  <br>  I'm going to let you know that, no matter what, it will take practice to get your methods down and expect to waste a coal or two or maybe even some shishah while you're trying to figure out the best way to do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun hookah-ing!!|`|HoHHpwDlaa	Hey there!<br>  <br>  Specific-ness!  :]  <br>  <br>  How to Setup a Hookah - Beginners Guide<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_BCJ1xOQTE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_BCJ1xOQ...</a><br>  this was a complete god-send when i didn't know how to set up mine for the first time. <br>  <br>  How To Set Up A Hookah by SaharaSmoke.com.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebC6uUT6l8&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebC6uUT6...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

(b) DONT use the metal screen, the ash gets into the holes so easily. Use the foil, 1 or 2 layers.

Wi3Z3vSQaa	You can get a 190 proof (95% alcohol) version of Everclear. Just because you can buy it doesn't mean you should drink it ;)<br>  <br>  The next step down is 151 proof (75% alcohol), and there are a number of options there. Bacardi 151, Everclear, etc...<br>  <br>  Most liquors are around 80 proof, or 40% alcohol.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Spirytus Rektyfikowany.  It's like Everclear from Poland but it's a tiny bit stronger at %96|`|0vQsoYIbaa	Well, we used to be able to buy 190 proof grain alcohol in the Pennsylvania state liquor stores, but you really don't want to do that.<br>  <br>  It is more possible to kill yourself with that stuff.|`|AA11835015	true! everclear 95% can be dangerous. if you cut it with water, juice, etc to 50 % say, it is no worse than 100 proof whiskey.<br>  a lot of 96% was sold in russia in the unregulated 1990s, many people died. it can also cause throat and stomach cancer. i tried it just to see how BAD it hits your throat, and it was only once. i felt like: why punish yourself rather than drinking something you enjoy? often we find 70% absinthe, but i am 1/2 afraid to drink that. makes a scratchy throat... not good...|`|dJXdiCYPaa	Illegal or legal, cause there is always mooshine, lightnin', kersun! whatever you call it, and they don't exactly have that on the FDA program.

It is often used as a substitute for wheat flour in baking, but due to the lack of gluten, it requires other ingredients for binding such as tapioca starch, guar gum or xanthan gum. However, some rice flour may not be gluten-free, due to cross-contamination at the flour mill – check with your supplier if this is important.<br>  <br>  Some types of rice flour:<br>  <br>  White rice flour – highly refined, generally best as a thickener or in combination with other flours<br>  Brown rice flour – milled from the whole grain, so more flavour and nutrition than white rice flour; often not milled fine enough for baking, so select carefully<br>  Glutinous rice flour (also sweet rice flour) – made from white glutinous rice, better for baking than white rice flour<br>  Roasted red rice flour – used for making roti, dosai or hoppers, especially in Sri Lankan cuisine
hZQg56d9aa	You could sure try, you could take them and set up a little table at your church and see if after church when people are walking out they want to buy for a mid morning snack.  You could also make a little flyer and hand out to friends and family so they can 'order' from you so your not throwing any away, instead your making them knowing they are already sold.  You could also take to school and sell to your friends. <br>  <br>  If your really looking for odd and ends ideas to make money I wouldn't limit yourself to just baking I would also look into doing side jobs for people like cleaning windows, washing cars, yard work, etc.  Also pet sitting if someone is going on vacation (check with your parents first).  Just make up some flyers and hand out to friends and family (no strangers)  tell people to hold onto the flyers cuz they might not need the help now but maybe in a few weeks!|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	Who will you market your cookies to?   <br>  <br>  You could try.  Just insert each completely cooled cookie in one of those cheap fold over baggies. Set hem out on your display with a price and see what happens.  Make a little sign to identify type of cookie and price.<br>  <br>  Or if you know someone having some guests over for coffee or running a meeting, ask them if they want to order some cookies to serve. That way you can sell more at once.|`|bbpDgLonaa	Maybe not the best idea, but sell them to your friends and family, you'll    <br>  be making a lot off cookies probably and don't sell ones over 2 dollars, <br>  personally i like oatmeal and raisin

0maJCeLCaa	Triple Sec is used for Tequila Margarita, but you can use it in many other drinks, where you want the intense orange flavour.<br>  <br>  A nice shot is the B52 (as in the bomber plane). It's a 3-layered drink, which presents really nice, and tastes fantastic.<br>  Get a shot glass, and fill 1/3 with a coffee liqueur (f.ex. Tia Maria or Kahlua). Then pour as much Baileys (or other cream liqueur) on top, using a spoon, so the 2 don't mix, but the Baileys float on top of the Kahlua. Finally top with Triple Sec - also poured over the spoon. <br>  <br>  Serve :)

kfOpbbCyaa	This is a guess, but I'd say that the freezer is meant to be closed most of the time to keep items frozen and therefore gets less "traffic" than the refrigerator. A light in the refrigerator would be more necessary to find those small items that get thrown into it. Besides which, the refrigerator is generally larger and used more frequently.<br>  <br>  Another thing I found is from <a href="http://www.fluther.com/disc/5108/why-is-there-a-light-in-the-refrigerator-but-not-in/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fluther.com/disc/5108/why-is-...</a> (a question and answer forum & this is part of richardhenry's post):<br>  "Because the temperature in a freezer is much lower than of a refrigerator, a much more expensive shatterproof bulb would have to be used. In fact, if you put a common household bulb in the fridge, it will be fine. But put it in the freezer, and it should crack after a few hours (or days, depending on the temperature you freezer operates at)."<br>  <br>  It does make sense that a more expensive and specialized bulb would be required, which would hike the cost and be more difficult to maintain.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Because you have an old, cheap freezer.

On the other hand, I have a separate, large freezer and it does have a light.  I think that's a good question, and I'm going to also guess that it may have something to do with how often it gets used.  <br>  <br>  It may also have to do with size.  I think larger freezers, even when on a refrigerator, probably have lights because of the relative difficulty of finding things as compared to a smaller freezer.  Cost-cutting also seems like a viable possibility.|`|AjFC8mEFaa	my parents freezer in the laundry room has a light in it. i think some freezers don't have lights because my parents freezer that they had years ago didn't have a light.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Probably just cost-cutting.

6768c11da3a7523681b339d4d16ff8b6aa	Make sure you allow your eggs to come to room temperature before beating them. Warm eggs accept more air and make for a fluffier omelet. You may also try whipping in a small amount of pancake batter. This will help the omelet rise but will be undetectable in the final product. (IHop does this with its omelets.)<br>  <br>  As for fillings, I like the old ham & cheese standard.|`|3QGv54ynaa	Try putting a splash of milk in scrambled egg and then cook it. It comes out fluffy. My dad does it. <br>  I like omelets with cheddar cheese and cut up turkey lunch meat. Then I cook it and add salt and pepper. You can also cut up some bacon and put in in the mix too. Yum! <br>  Your omelets might be coming out too thin because your pan it to large. Also, don't use a super high heat. <br>  Hope that helps. =]|`|AA11610779	For each egg, you add 1/2 a tablespoonful of water. You add that before you mix the egg. Or you can whip up the egg white and incorporate them before you beat the whole thing into an omelet.|`|Whd6tqLzaa	You have to make sure that your pan is heated enough. When I pour the egg mixture in the pan, I take it away from the flame (to avoid burning at the bottom). Then I lower the the flame into really low and cover the pan. I let the pan sit on the stove top for some time. If you use a glass cover, you could see your omelet is getting all fluffy in the pan. Then I take it off the pan and serve.<br>  <br>  You can add milk in your egg mixture, I never did. Some times I add pickled jalapeno peppers or olives or cheese after I pour the mixture to the pan. You can add anything at this point to satisfy your taste buds.|`|YQTBQ5xyaa	Beat the eggs with a little milk or cream really well.  They should be foamy when you pour them in the pan.  Also, make sure your pan is hot, but not too hot.  Don't over cook them.  <br>  <br>  One method of omelet making is to scramble the eggs when you first put them into the pan.  Once they begin to set, let them form a single sheet of eggs.  You can also flip them, but do not let them brown.  The omelet will come out really fluffy if you use this method correctly.<br>  <br>  I like to put a pinch of minced garlic, minced onion and Lowry's season salt in with the eggs before I whip them.  Sour cream or cream cheese is also good and shredded pepper jack, spinach, mushrooms and chicken are some of my favorite omelet ingredients.

pMFLqU0Yaa	There are a couple of things you can do. Here's a variation on crisco frosting, but a better flavor because it's made with butter - which I think is tasty! LOL!<br>  <br>       * 1 cup sugar<br>      * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br>      * 1 1/3 cups milk<br>      * 1 cup butter, softened<br>      * 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In 2-quart saucepan, thoroughly combine sugar and flour. With wire whisk, gradually stir in milk until smooth. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture has thickened and boils. Reduce heat to low; cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and cool completely. <br>  <br>  In medium bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat butter until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in milk mixture; beat in vanilla.<br>  <br>  <br>  OR, this frosting that tastes like chocolate ice cream - if you have the stuff for it.<br>  <br>      *   1 cup chocolate chips (real, semi-sweet)<br>      * 1/3 cup milk<br>      * 1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows (or 15 large)<br>      * 1 cup heavy whipping cream<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>  <br>  Melt chocolate chips, milk and marshmallows in top of double boiler over simmering water. Cool to room temperature. Whip cream until stiff.  Fold in vanilla and chocolate mixture. Frosts one 9x13 or 8 inch layer cake. <br>  <br>  OR an adaptation of a popular fluffy southern frosting<br>  <br>      *   3 cups granulated sugar<br>      * 1/3 cup light corn syrup<br>      * 3/4 cup boiling water<br>      * 6 large egg whites<br>      * 1 pinch salt<br>      * 1 teaspoon vanilla<br>      * 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br>  <br>  Place sugar, corn syrup and boiling water in a 3 qt saucepan over moderate heat. Stir until sugar dissolves. When mixture comes to a full boil, remove from heat and set aside briefly <br>  <br>  Beat egg whites with salt to stiff peaks.<br>  <br>  Transfer hot syrup to a pitcher for easy pouring.<br>  <br>  Beating at high speed, pour hot syrup in a thin threadlike stream into the whites. Pour slowly and scrape down sides if necessary to keep the entire mass well mixed. Frosts one 9x13 cake or two cake layers.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Do you have whipping cream?  You can beat it to stiff peaks with 1/2 package of either pudding or jello mix.  This will flavor and color it.

jZRtTpZiaa	Hi!  If it's a fresh new batch of flaxseed, it should be just fine.  You should keep it in the fridge so it doesn't go rancid over a longer period of time before you're done using it up.  You can smell rancid flax when it has  sort of an oil paint smell,  and it won't taste right. <br>  <br>  You can buy whole flaxseed and grind it yourself in a little coffee grinder at home too.  It keeps longer when it's whole.   But I usually use the bag of flax I buy long before it would ever go rancid.|`|llkSmgLJaa	It's still good, and it will be good a week or more from now. It smells nasty when it's gone bad.|`|D3rw1C8faa	It has a high fat content and the oils in it can become rancid.  Buy only fresh, small quantities and keep refrigerated.

c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Rub it with a bit of olive oil, sprinkle with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.  Put it into a hot skillet and don't move it for at least 4 minutes, turn it only once and depending on how thick it is will determine how long to cook it.  After cooking, remove it to a plate and cover loosely with foil and let it sit for about 5 minutes to let the juices get settled.  Top it with a pat of butter and serve.<br>  <br>   I don't marinate mine, but if you do, make sure to pat it dry with paper towels before putting it in the hot pan.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	The first answer is really good.  I'd just like to add that some steakhouses add a pat of seasoned butter to the top of the steak as it's resting after cooking.  I sometimes do that, or I drizzle it with a small amount of really good quality balsamic vinegar while it's resting.  The flavor is amazing.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't marinate a good steak because it shouldn't be necessary.  However, I agree with you about the Italian dressing...I use it to marinate the meat and veggies for kebabs.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I didn't see the second answer before I posted mine.  That's a really unusual method.  I'm curious about what kind of steak you use for that recipe?|`|edPeEGzmaa	Well first off if you want a restaurant quality steak make sure you get the best stuff. It's pricier, but tastes FAR better than the average lesser quality steak. In Canada standard quality steak is AA, and the premium stuff is AAA. This alone will make your steak delicious by itself.<br>  <br>  You can really marinate it in anything that you like. Italian dressing, beer, bbq sauce, whatever you want. I actually usually don't marinate my steaks, but whatever flavours that you enjoy are worth experimenting with. If you're not sure about something, just cut off a piece of the steak and marinate only that part to see if you like it, then you know for next time.<br>  <br>  I put some Montreal steak spice and salt and pepper on both sides of the steak, then push it in and spread it around with a spoon so that it all doesn't fall off while cooking.<br>  <br>  I always make sure that I cook my steak on a low setting (I do mine on the BBQ). I like my steak well done and thus cooking it low and slowly lets it cook thoroughly and evenly. Then when it's nearing completion I'll throw on a few different flavours of BBQ sauce and put some more of the Montreal steak spice and salt and pepper on. Around now I also raise the temperature quite high so that the edges char a bit. I love a slightly charred steak.<br>  <br>  I've never done a steak on a skillet so I don't know how different it is, you can still probably achieve the charred effect if you want though.|`|Yek5D2Chaa	try it the carne asada style. . jst season with a lil salt, garlic powder, and a generous amount of lemon juice( or try it with a  beer instead of lemon juice). cover it and let it cook for a few mins about 10 to 15 min. then take the lid off the pan and let the juices dry while turning the steak occasionally until your steak gets a little caramelized color in both sides... then enjoy!!|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I cook my steaks in a skillet  with 4 tablespoon of Liquid smoke and 1 1/2 cup of water , cook slow with cover ,it make the steaks so tender.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	The Italian dressing is a short cut, try olive oil & balsamic vinegar.<br>  Add any spices you like, such as ground pepper, garlic salt, etc.<br>  Restaurants dry age their steaks, after selecting the top beef.

xrRZeROmaa	Basic Red Chile Sauce    (Salsa de Chile Rojo)<br>  <br>  Makes about 2 1/2 cups<br>  <br>  This sauce can be used whenever red chile sauce is called for, such as for enchiladas and chilaquiles.  Use gloves with the chiles.  (These are dried chiles)<br>  <br>  6 guajillo chiles (about 1 1/2 ounces)<br>  4 large ancho chiles (about 3 ounces)<br>  2 teaspoons vegetable oil<br>  1/2 medium onion, chopped<br>  2 medium garlic cloves, chopped<br>  1 teaspoon dried oregano (Mexican variety preferred), crumbled<br>  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br>  2 medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped <br>  3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste<br>  <br>       1)  Wipe the chiles with damp paper towels.  With scissors, cut off the tops and cut each chile lengthwise in half.  Remove the seeds and reins.  On a comal, or dry skillet, toast the chiles about 3 seconds on each side, holding them down with a wide spatula until barely blistered and aromatic.  Do not burn, or they will be bitter.  Submerge the chiles in a bowl of hot water, and soak about 20 minutes.<br>  <br>       2)  Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat and cook the onion and garlic slowly until they start to brown, 5 to 6 minutes.  Stir in the oregano and cumin and immediately transfer to a blender.  Add the tomatoes to the blender.  With tongs, lift the chiles from the soaking water and put them in the blender.  Taste the chile water.  If it has a pleasant taste and is not bitter, add 1/2 cup chile water to the blender, along with 1/4 cup of water.  (If it is bitter, discard the chile water and add 3/4 cup of water.)   Blend the mixture 1 minute or until the sauce is as smooth as possible, scraping down the sides of the blender jar as needed.  Pour the sauce through a strainer or a food mill, into a medium bowl.  Discard remaining bits of tough skin and seeds.<br>  <br>       3)  Transfer the pureed chile sauce to a saucepan and simmer the sauce 15 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally, until completely cooked and flavors are blended.  The sauce is ready to use or cover and rrefrigerate for up to  5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months
AA12145054	Phall Curry<br>  <br>  Phall (sometimes spelt as phaal, phal or paal) is an Indian curry dish, which originated in South India. It is one of the hottest forms of curry regularly available, even hotter than the Vindaloo, using a large number of ground standard chillies, or a hotter type of chilli such as scotch bonnet or habanero. Typically, the dish includes ginger and optionally fennel seeds.<br>  <br>  The phall has achieved notoriety as the hottest generally available dish from Indian restaurants. For example, the well-known Brick Lane Curry House in New York has a "P'Hall of Fame" on their website and will provide customers who finish the dish with a free drink and a certificate, whilst in the UK, a charity competition was based on competitors eating increasingly hot phalls.|`|MdSU0s8Saa	a tinderloo|`|I5pUxwPbaa	vindaloo can be as hot as you want it, it all depends on how much chillies/chilly powder you add to it. any curry dish can be really hot, just adjust the recipe and go crazy with chillies|`|b718fa2d9a8d00357a3f45f873ceaa0eaa	Go to your local curry house and ask for "phal curry".<br>  <br>  see question><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071028112430AAovUwP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	Mine it is so hot one teaspoon of powder added will blow your head off.

cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	There are programs for teens created by some of our more famous chefs.  I know Emeril has one for instance.  The problem, I think they are mainly for troubled teens, trying to give them an outlet.  Go to Emeril.com and look for his program.  If you can't find what you're looking for, go to a good restaurant, and see if you can't "help out".  Chefs can be guarded with their secrets sometimes, but they also seem to enjoy a camaraderie with each other, and might appreciate your genuine desire to learn.  You could get your cooking school for free, learn a lot, and it could possibly turn into a part-time job when you get a little older.  Also, look at the adult community ed. classes in your area.  They might not be advertising towards kids, but I really doubt they're going to turn one away.

jZRtTpZiaa	Human breast milk is entirely vegan because it is naturally what a mother voluntarily provides for her child of her own species.   If a cow walks up to you and sticks her teats into your mouth,  by all means,  drink away.   Breast milk has nothing to do with not harming animals.   If, however, you were to take a lactating woman,  hold her captive, feed her an unnatural diet,  take her baby away and kill him for meat, while you hook her up to a machine to steal her baby's milk (as long as she's still producing milk, otherwise you'll kill her too),  that would not be vegan-- just as it is not vegan with regard to cow milk.|`|ugW9r4gRaa	The definition of vegan is a vegetarian who omits all animal products from their diet. The primary reason for becoming a vegan is animal rights issues regarding the treatment of animals who are killed, or have other products taken from them.<br>  <br>  In the case of a human, you obviously know the mother is likely not forced into cramped cages with other human's providing milk, and there's no dangerous genetic modification going on. I think the common belief will be that breast milk does not make you any less vegan.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Yes. Of course.<br>  <br>  Being vegan is not really about avoiding animal products, but about trying to be a 'natural' human, with the addition of moral obligation and idealism, I guess you could say. That is, we are not designed for nor do we need to kill and eat animals, therefore why do it? Just because it's tradition?  Because some say it tastes good?  Because "Someone else is doing the killing, I'm just doing the eating"?  Hey, there are some weirdos out there that think killing and raping other humans is a great thing to do and perhaps it's a tradition in their family, but does that mean it should be allowed? Even if that tradition has been passed down through the generations for the last 1000 years?  What if it were 2000 years, would that make a difference? <br>  <br>  What if there was a whole civilization that made it a common practise to kill a child for their god every month of the year?  Hey, it's their right to do whatever they want, right?  It's their 4000 year old tradition and nobody should be able to say that it's wrong because it's part of their culture and longstanding traditions, not to mention part of their religion.  No, of course this does not make it okay.  Nor does it make it okay to sacrifice another life for food when there is no need for it.<br>  <br>  Okay, my little rant is over.|`|J4wTIhsoaa	No, because it's using human milk, and we're animals. But be careful you can be charged with child endangerment if the baby doesn't have have proper nutrients, babies need a lot of nutrients to grow.|`|lwKz0iDJaa	On an episode of Dr. House, a couple were raising their kids as vegans and he called child service in - it's very unhealthy, they need stuff that we dont anymore so make sure they're getting it one way or another but i dont know abt ur q|`|Aoc9wRIqaa	You'd have to be an idiot to raise a child without milk, though technically drinking a mother's breast milk is not vegan.|`|aBtUtnKtaa	Like DAH!

5zNwBQZHaa	Naturally soft water is fine to drink from the tap.  If you came from a place that hard water - you will notice the water has less taste than it used to.<br>  <br>  Hard and Soft refer to how many dissolved solids - like minerals - are in the water.  Well water is generally harder than rain water.  <br>  <br>  Plus you'll also notice that softer water gets your laundry whiter and brighter because minerals aren't being deposited on your clothes as they wash.<br>  <br>  Naturally soft water is fine to drink.<br>  <br>  However - drinking water that has been artificially softened by use of an in-home water softener isn't such a good idea.  In order to make that water soft - the water softener machine adds a type of sodium to the water to replace the minerals.  Too much sodium is bad for people with High Blood Pressure or other health issues.  <br>  <br>  But that is only water that has been softened by an in-home machine, not naturally soft water from the tap.<br>  <br>  Drink up!|`|9b4NCdmBaa	I say boiling always helps.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	It's hard water you need to worry about.<br>  <br>  Soft water is drinkable, tastes good, is much kinder on your skin and hair, washes clothes better and means you need to use much smaller quantities of house, laundry and personal cleaners.|`|yfwY8XGlaa	Should you drink softened water? If you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure you should avoid drinking it. If you are on a low-salt diet or seeking to reduce your salt intake you shouldn't drink softened water. However, recent studies have shown that the amount of salt consumed by drinking softened water is insignificant when compared to overall daily salt intake. If you love soft water as many people do, then, simply choose the most efficient water softener available (EcoWater) and install a reverse osmosis system to remove the remaining sodium from your drinking and cooking water.<br>  <br>  Potassium chloride can be used as a substitute for Sodium chloride (salt) in water softeners.

Cook, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved; then cook without stirring, lowering the heat and cooking more slowly during the last few minutes, to the hard crack stage (300 degrees F), If sugar crystals form on sides of pan, wipe them off with a damp brush.<br>  <br>  Remove from heat, add oil flavoring and enough food coloring to color; stir only to mix. Pour into 2 well buttered 9 inch pans. Set one pan of candy over a sauce pan containing hot water (unless you have a helper to help cut the candy). As soon as the other pan of candy is cool enough to handle, cut it with scissors into 1-inch strips. Then snip the strips into pieces. Work fast. Drop the pieces onto a buttered baking sheet. If the candy cools too quickly, set it on a saucepan over hot water to soften it, but if it gets sticky, return at once to the work counter.<br>  <br>  Toss in a small amount of powdered sugar to keep from sticking together. Repeat with the second pan of candy. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://baking911.com/recipes/candy/hard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://baking911.com/recipes/candy/hard....</a>|`|zEz0tfNRaa	Anise Hard Candy<br>  <br>  1 1/2 teaspoons butter, softened (NO SUBSTITUTES)<br>  3/4 cup water<br>  2/3 cup light corn syrup<br>  2 cups granulated sugar<br>  1 teaspoon anise extract<br>  Red food coloring<br>  2 to 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar<br>  <br>  Butter an 8-inch square baking pan with 1 1/2 teaspoons butter; set aside.<br>  <br>  In a large heavy saucepan, combine water, corn syrup and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Cover and cook for 3 minutes to dissolve any sugar crystals. Uncover; cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard crack stage).<br>  <br>  Remove from heat; stir in anise extract and food coloring (keep face away from mixture as odor is very strong). Pour into prepared pan. Using a sharp knife, score into 3/4-inch squares. Cool.<br>  <br>  Separate into squares, using a sharp knife, if necessary. Place confectioners' sugar in a baking pan; add candy and roll until coated. Brush off excess sugar with a pastry brush.

Continue to cook, without stirring, until syrup reaches 290 degrees F on candy thermometer.<br>  <br>  Remove from heat and add food coloring to desired intensity and the desired oil flavoring.

Stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat and cook until thermometer registers 250 degrees F, firm ball stage. Add butter; cook with occasional stirring until thermometer registers 300 degrees F (brittle stage). Remove from stove; add vanilla extract; pour into buttered shallow pan, making a layer 1/4 inch deep. While warm, crease into squares with a blunt knife. When cold, break into pieces.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Candy Canes<br>  <br>  6 cups granulated sugar<br>  3 cups cold water<br>  2 tablespoons light corn syrup<br>  1/8 teaspoon salt<br>  1 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>  Peppermint flavoring oil<br>  Food coloring<br>  <br>  Combine sugar, water, corn syrup and salt in a large heavy pan. Heat and stir until sugar crystals are dissolved, then stop stirring. Bring to a rolling boil and wash down the crystals, then add the cream of tartar. Boil rapidly to the hard crack stage on a candy thermometer.<br>  <br>  Pour two-thirds of the syrup out quickly onto a slab or greased flat pan. Pour the rest into a buttered glass pie pan, and do not move until partly set. Turn the edges in on each portion and add flavoring to each - about 6 drops of oil to the large portion and 3 to the small. Add food coloring to the small dish. As soon as possible, start to pull the portion in the large container until pearly-colored. (It will be very hot - butter your hands and set it down when it gets too hot!) Form it into a ball.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile gather up the colored portion and form it into a rope and wrap it around the ball. With one person on each end, start to stretch and twist the ball in opposite directions to form a long rope with the traditional stripe. Cut into lengths as necessary. When the desired diameter is achieved, cut and form into canes (roll it on the board to get it smooth). If it gets too cold to work with, put on a wooden breadboard in a warm oven to soften.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cinnamon Rock Candy<br>  <br>  1 cup water<br>  3 3/4 cups granulated sugar<br>  1 1/4 cups light corn syrup<br>  1 teaspoon red liquid food coloring<br>  1 teaspoon cinnamon oil<br>  1/3 cup confectioners' sugar<br>  <br>  Line a 15 x 10-inch baking pan with foil and butter the foil; set aside.<br>  <br>  In a large heavy saucepan, combine water, sugar, corn syrup and food coloring. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cover and cook for 3 minutes to dissolve sugar crystals. Uncover; cook on medium-high heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard crack stage), about 25 minutes.<br>  <br>  Remove from heat; stir in cinnamon oil. Immediately pour into prepared pan. Cool completely, about 45 minutes. Break into pieces using the edge of a metal mallet. Sprinkle both sides of candy with confectioners' sugar.

Place over low heat and stir until mixture boils. Cover the saucepan for 5 minutes so that any sugar crystals that have formed on the sides of the pan will be washed down. Now put in the candy thermometer and let the candy boil without stirring. Using a pastry brush or a fork wrapped with muslin and dipped in water, wash off any crystals that might form. After the candy reaches 280 degrees, lower heat so as not to discolor the candy. When candy thermometer registers 300 degrees, remove pan from the heat and allow it to stand until all the bubbles have simmered down. Then add the flavoring and coloring. There are many to choose from but one favorite is anise along with red coloring. One teaspoon of a flavoring extract should be used for this recipe, while only a few drops of an oil such as peppermint, wintergreen or cinnamon are enough. Coloring should be added gradually until the desired intensity is reached. It is important to stir these in as gently as possible. Too much stirring will cause the syrup to solidify into a hard sugary lump. Now the candy is ready to be formed. It may be poured into a pan, 7 by 7 inches, and marked into squares as it begins to harden. Or it may be poured in rounds on skewers or sticks to form lollipops.

If that isn't it, you can try moving the fermenter to a warmer spot or covering it to hold the heat in. Before you give up on a batch, check the SG. If it has dropped from the OG, your wort is fermenting so seal it up again and let it go.|`|fc7d78df36e4b2395fd6613441d8c67eaa	DO NOT ADD SUGAR !!!!!<br>  <br>  Your yeast is too old, wrong (lager) or your malt may be too old (is it canned Mr. Beer style) or your vessel was contaminated with cleaner (bleach, other).<br>  <br>  If you re-pitched and still haven't had anything happening after 24 hrs. your batch maybe wasted. I know how hard it is to chuck a batch believe me. But trying to salvage a bad batch will do no one any good.<br>  <br>  Wait another 72 hrs. just to be sure (nothing to lose if it's junk), if still no action, start over and make sure to rinse all cleaners thoroughly before fermentation.<br>  <br>  Also get a small heater with a thermostat and a digital temperature gauge, put the whole works in a walk-in sized closet (worked wonders for me) point the heater away from the ferm. vessel and keep a close eye on the temp.

A3tg75UDaa	I have just one word for you: experiment<br>  <br>  OK, you want more than one word? You need to up the tequila and drop the cointreau down a little. Plus you're probably not using the same mixer. Did that place in Vallarta use a "margarita mixer", Rose's lime juice or fresh lime juice? That would make a HUGE difference in flavor.
2bf6acf3f4a911280e04850ab8ab1521aa	All alcoholic drinks are pretty much strong. Stay away from anything that is brown. and drink water in between every other 3rd drink. If you keep drinking all night you  will wake up with a really bad hang over. There is nothing like waking up to the toilet. Drink at least 4 glasses of water before you go to bed and eat crackers or toast. soak up the alcohol.|`|fERs7TzVaa	If you're not used to alcohol, I'd stay away from cocktails altogether, and go for cider, beer or possibly wine. Stop when you feel an effect, and wait to see how strong it is 15 minutes later. Drink lots of non-alcoholic drinks too, helps prevent a hangover.|`|sYb9UJGOaa	anything frozen|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Frozen margaritas are good (frozen means on the blender, and they taste like an "icee").

It's not "bad" meaning it won't make you sick, but it gets an "off" taste.  And, if the steak has been badly burned, it will smell "funny" as it cooks.  But, October isn't that far back.  If the meat was wrapped well, it should still be good.  I've had chicken in the freezer that lasted a year without freezer burn.  When you open the package, smell it.  If burned, you will smell it right away.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|D3rw1C8faa	The meat will be fine unless it has freezer burn.  If there are parts of the meat that are white (DEHYDRATED and BURNED) then you can either cut those pieces off and proceed with cooking or if it is too freezer burned then discard it.<br>  Next time wrap the meet in another layer of freezer paper or freezer bags and use before 3 months time.|`|p0dP4Oiyaa	Generally it will have a layer of frost on it.

RJpekNPfaa	I don’t know how many calories it has, I am not obsessed or interested in counting calories.<br>  <br>  The low fat plain bagel is suspicious. I would have to know the full ingredient list before commenting further.<br>  <br>  I am always suspicious of anything that proclaims “low fat” or “diet”.<br>  <br>  It normally just means that it is packed full of fillers. <br>  <br>  They also tend to use powdered milk - which is normally sourced from China and the less said about that the better! <br>  <br>  These sorts of products are also normally full of artificial sweeteners or corn syrup and these two products are very detrimental to your health.<br>  <br>  So I can’t really comment on the healthy aspect of a plain bagel. <br>  <br>  In future, try to buy whole grain or multi-grain bagels instead, as they contain more natural fibre. <br>  <br>  I don’t know what garden and vegetables cream cheese is but it sounds foul. And it sounds foul because it sounds highly processed.<br>  <br>  I found the ingredients on the web and they said:<br>  <br>  * MAJOR Ingredients: Pasteurized Non-fat milk and milk-fat.<br>  <br>  * Vegetable Ingredients in SMALL AMOUNTS includes: Onions, Carrots, Green Bell Peppers, Red Bell Peppers & Cucumbers.<br>  <br>  * Allergen alert: Sulphating Agents and Colour Red 40<br>  <br>  So it would be a better idea to make your own from scratch:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.about.com/vegetarian/Vegetable-Cream-Cheese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://video.about.com/vegetarian/Vegeta...</a><br>  <br>  So maybe next time you could have a whole grain bagel ~ topped with organic mashed avocado, home-made garden & vegetables cream cheese, a whole grated carrot and some freshly grated beetroot. <br>  <br>  Natural sugars in fruit and vegetables are healthy and are treated and utilised in your body entirely differently than refined or artificial sugars would be, so no need to worry about that.  <br>  <br>  The fruit smoothie (orange, kiwi, strawberries, blueberries & lemon juice) sounds fantastic and very healthy…………as long as all the produce was from FRESH RAW fruit?<br>  <br>  One thing I will mention is food combining. You should eat fruits / drink fruits on an empty stomach and wait about an hour before eating anything else.<br>  <br>  So perhaps have your smoothie and then wait 30 mins to 1 hour before consuming your bagel. <br>  <br>  Bad food combining can cause fermentation in the stomach and lead to bloating and gas.<br>  <br>  I am also hoping your description is for one meal and not what you consumed all day? I know many teenagers get obsessed about calories and as a result tend to stave themselves throughout the day. For weight loss and general health, you are better off to graze and have five small meals throughout the day.<br>  <br>  So you may need to fine tune a few things but generally you seem to be eating fairly healthily for a teenager.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|D3rw1C8faa	Where was your protein?  You consumed mainly carbohydrates and lots of sugar with all that fruit  Your body will burn protein better than all the carbs.|`|3q490h6saa	mmmm sounds pretty healthy.  its all healthy um how many calories? don't know but it is healthy.... lol i think.....|`|1jIzBUkhaa	you had a very healthy lunch but for the cream cheese, it is fating|`|uj9GjzdOaa	Why just half a carrot?  They don't have many calories.  I would use peanut butter instead of cream cheese because of the protein and good fats you're lacking in this meal.  Also exchange the bagel for whole wheat.  Total calories would be somewhere between 350-450cal depending on brands/size.  Depending on size of breakfast, lunch and snacks, if you eat this much 4-5 times a day you should be eating pretty good.  Check out sparkpeople.com for free calorie counting and community.  Better yet, make a sandwich full of green and colorful veggies & hummus.  Fruits are high in sugar.  Overall better than most Americans and definitely meeting your fruit requirements for the day at lunch.|`|IMwLQG1haa	seems like a very healthy lunch to me. my mother used to be a nutritionist and i asked my mother and she said that was very healthy.<br>  all that you consumed was probably 350-400 calories because of all the fruit you had those are good calories.<br>  it is good to know that there are teenagers out there that dont eat junk food constantly for luch|`|4YxuxEIOaa	it sounds a good balanced meal. you have got most of your daily allowance just from your smoothie!<br>  <br>  well done :)<br>  <br>  you eat very well for a 19 year old. just drink loads of water too and it will make u feel amazing.|`|oAwgNL40aa	sounds like a yummy lunch.  i think its healthy   maybe not the cream cheese so much   but its not that bad.  youre eating good. dont worry about it.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Sounds great!  You had a few carbs (but not bad); your protein; and lots of fruit.  This sounds very healthy, and also very tasty!!  I don't think the calories are that important when you eat this healthy, since they're all working calories (and protein burns fat).  If you ate the same amount of calories with just cookies or candy, then you'd have problems:)|`|BhFeii5Xaa	<a href="http://www.sparkpeople.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparkpeople.com</a> and join the team! Then you can put tye ingredients to your meals and recipes in the nutrition generator and see what is lacking in your food plan.<br>  <br>  I note there is absolutely no veggies other than a little carrot which is pure sugar and a bit of fiber.

I only managed 48 hours, because I had to go out;  passing the Baker's shop robbed me of my will- power , even though I shut my eyes -   the irresistible aroma of freshly- baked rolls finally did for me !One friend managed a week, but got the beginning of a stomach- ulcer; so much for ' reaching a higher plane'!

eAobNmUTaa	No.  You really need to use a short grain/glutinous (sticky) rice.  A regular rice will not conform to the sushi and hold shape.  :)|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	that depends,what is meant by "normal " rice?|`|CxCigxZIaa	Unfortunately no.<br>  It gets TOO chewy.<br>  However I did find this.<br>  This was the best way I found to do mine. It's really not that difficult to do. Also make sure you use a sticky short-grain Asian rice to begin with or it won't be sushi rice. I use the Kokohu Brand.<br>  <br>  Here is how I make my rice on the stove top if you don't have a rice cooker.<br>  <br>  I always rinse my rice in cold water first. It helps get some starch off, but you still have it sticky. If you like it really sticky then skip this step.<br>  <br>  Use 1 to 1 ? cups of water to every cup of dried rice. Use your finger tip to measure. The water line above the rice should be a finger tip deep.<br>  <br>  Bring up to a boil, put on a lid and lower the heat. Let the rice simmer with the lid on for about 15 minutes. Next, remove the pot from the heat and leave the lid on. Let the rice rest and fully absorb the liquid for about five minutes. Fluff with a fork.<br>  <br>  Add the following when you make sushi rice (use 3 cups of cooked rice):<br>  <br>  1/3 cup rice vinegar<br>  3 Tbsp sugar<br>  1 tsp salt<br>  <br>  Prepare sushi vinegar (sushi-zu) by mixing rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a sauce pan. Put the pan on low heat and heat until the sugar dissolves. Cool the vinegar mixture.<br>  <br>  Spread the hot steamed rice into a large plate or a large bowl. Please use a non-metallic bowl to prevent any interaction with rice vinegar. It's best to use a wooden bowl called sushi-oke. Sprinkle the vinegar mixture over the rice and fold the rice by shamoji (rice spatula) quickly. Be careful not to smash the rice.<br>  <br>  To cool and remove the moisture of the rice well, use a fan as you mix sushi rice. This will give sushi rice a shiny look. It's best to use sushi rice right away.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Sushi rice is made from short grain rice for a reason - it gets sticky when cooked and that is what makes it stick together.<br>  <br>  Using medium or long grained rice will not have this effect and you won't get the rice to stick together.  The dressing you added to it - vinegar, water and sugar - is not what holds sushi together - it is the stickiness of the rice.<br>  <br>  Sorry.

gIJ5JDdvaa	I am 14 as well and recently turned vegan the in january for animal rights reasons as well. it was the best choice i had ever made. i had been wanting to become a vegetarian but no one in my family would support me but i forced them too. the only trouble i had was convincing my mom to buy soy based foods w/o meat. its been only 2 months and i am already a vegan for animal rights reasons it is hard but when u get the facts about things u can eat it feels GREAT!!!<br>   1) u wont feel lazy at all actually when i stopped eating meat i felt more lively and happy knowing that meat wasn't rotting in my colon.<br>  2)u will have more energy and feel a lot happier trust me, u will be able to look at animals knowing that u dont contribute to eating them.<br>  3) soy foods actually have A LOT of protein but go to a vitamin store and tell them ur nutritional situation and they will give u good vitamins that u need.<br>  4) tofurky is a GREAT substitute brand, tofu as well cooked right it tastes about the same.<br>  5)  well most soy products do contain dairy but not tofurky ( u can finf it at your local grocery store) it is vegan.<br>  6) really u HAVE to do research on this because pretty much everything contains some form of animal unless it is vegan so DO UR RESEARCH!!!<br>  7) i havent lost anything yet but it depends if u eat healthy<br>  <br>  <br>  yes please stick with it go to goveg.com, peta.com, peta2.com and get info on why it is good to be veg and get the facts so u can tell people why they should be veg too so u dont seem uneducated on the reasons.good for u because it really DOES help and try to convince ur friends to do the same.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  also go to <a href="http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/teennutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/teennutriti...</a><br>  please do ur research first tho!!!!|`|wtg8vtzBaa	You can go gradually.  Give up red meat, then fish, then chicken.  Whatever your reason for going vegetarian, it's a good choice.  Eat soy, veggies, nuts, grains for proteins.  When you eat plant-based proteins, eat a combination to get a complete set of amino acids.  You'll want to make sure things aren't cooked with meat when you eat them.  For example, I found out that a local Italian restaurant cooks its meatballs in the same spaghetti sauce they serve to vegetarians.

THe only difference I feel is I get less digestive discomfort, but I do feel hungry more often and have more gas. Most kinds of beans are excellent sources of protein.Soy products are excellent, and more healthful than meat. There are a lot of soy based meat substitutes available. Many are good ,and almost indistinguishable from meat. Some are not so good. Just shop around.<br>  Soy milk,especially the vanilla "Silk" is good in cereals or as a drink,especially good with chocolate.<br>    Vegetables can be cooked in a lot of interesting dishes ,and not just boiled and buttered like most of us grew up with. Check out the bookstore for veg cook books. Watch that you don't overload on too many carbs. I have seen a lot of vegetarians regularly fill up on pastas and potatoes. This will throw your blood sugar off and actually cause you to be more hungry. Of course pasta and potatoes are Ok in moderation. Try to eat whole foods like whole wheat, oats, fresh as possible fruits and vegs. Frozen is good and sometimes even better than "fresh" ones which are no longer fresh when they get to the store.<br>    All in all vegetarianism is better for your body, and the environment.<br>    A high potency natural vitamin/mineral supplement is always good ,too,just to make sure you aren't missing something like B12 that is only found in animal products.|`|wlEBP4HEaa	-Not hard to switch, as long as you do your reasearch 1st.<br>  -Not any trouble.<br>  -Not eating meat, but it's not as hard as you think it will be.<br>  -Don't stop, I started to feel really lazy and mopey when I started, but that's just your body detoxing, getting out all the junk you don't need.<br>  -You'll have a lot more energy when you're full veggie for a couple weeks.<br>  -You can eat nuts, eggs if your lacto-ovo, or ovo vegetarian, lentils, peanut butter. Most food does have some protein. I once read that as long as you get your calories, you'll get your protein requirements.<br>  -Beans, fruit, fake meat (morning star foods are good).<br>  -You can get calcium from leafy greens (broccoli, aspargus, brussel sprouts, etc.)<br>  -Meat sauce might have some, read the label. A lot of things have gelatin in them, which vegetarians don't eat. Again, you just have to read the label.<br>  -If you're healthy weight now, you shouldn't lose weight unless it's bearly any.<br>  <br>  Tips, eat more fruits, and veggies if you're not trying to lose weight. I would decide what kind of veggie you're going to become. Start by cutting out red meat (cow), then chicken, then fish. Go slowly into it. Watch out for gelatin, unless it's plant gelatin. And yes it's worth it. Many health factors are reduced if you're a "veghead". Cancer, heart attacks, diabetes.

I am a vegetarian from last 20 years and still I do not regret it.<br>   <br>  What was the hardest part?<br>  Initially eating outside with friends.<br>  <br>  Will I start feeling lazy and mopey when I stop?<br>  No you will not feel lazy at all.<br>  <br>  Will I not have as much energy?<br>  You will definitely have as much energy as you have. Because you will be doing exercise every morning to stay fit.<br>  <br>  What will I eat to get the protein I lose from meat?<br>  You can eat lots of beans, lentils. Basically lentils are the best substitute for the meat protiens.<br>  <br>  What are good subtitutes for meat?<br>  Try tofu.<br>  <br>  I'm not really big on dairy products, so will that be an issue because <br>  most subtitutes for vegetarian contain dairy?<br>  No it is not true. Because most vegetarian diet consists of leafy vegetables, lentils.<br>  <br>  What are things that I have to stop eating, that contain meat, that might seem like it doesn't? (what might 'secretly' contain meat?)<br>  Anything which has gelatine.<br>  <br>  How much weight will I lose, because I exercise daily? (again, I'm not TRYING to lose weight, I'm just wondering if this will be the reason if I start losing the pounds.)<br>  As you are starting to become a vegetarian. Do not think about weight. Just exercise. 30 minutes walk atleast. And stick to your vegetarian food. Do not think about the fats in oil or anything because as you are cutting your meat lots of the fat and oil will go. So try taking asian diet as they have less oil. <br>  <br>  Try to avoid MSG, SUGAR, drink lots of juices (HOMEMADE), because the ready made have sugar. <br>  <br>  Walk for 30 minutes very important. Start with 10 minutes a day and then increase it, will definitely help you.<br>  <br>  Try to take 5-6 small meals.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|tAR4T60aaa	Is it really hard to switch? <br>  It wasn't really hard for me, but I never liked meat so much. For most people the first few weeks, even months, can be hard. Especially if you are around meat-eaters a lot. After the first month or so, you'll look at a hamburger and be like "how did I ever eat that??"<br>  <br>  Did any of you have trouble?<br>  I had a little trouble, because my whole family, and most of my friends eat meat. They're also staunch conservatives, so they didn't understand why I did it. They teased me a lot in the beginning. But once you prove to them that you WON'T eat meat, they'll back off. That was the hardest part about becoming a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  Will I start feeling lazy and mopey when I stop?<br>  NO! You'll most likely have even more energy, I know I do. I feel so much better, both physically and psychologically. I have more energy, and I feel good when I don't eat the flesh of another animal.<br>  <br>  What will I eat to get the protein I lose from meat?<br>  My favorite things are beans. There's so many different types, and they can be used as a good substitute for meat. For example, if you used to eat tacos with beef, you can put re-fried beans in it instead. If you choose to eat milk and eggs, these are the best sources of protein. If you become a vegan, it's much harder to get protein. <br>  <br>  What are good substitutes for meat?<br>  Beans, tofu, soy, etc. Most grocery stores have a section that contains a bunch of good meat substitutes. Look around, and try them out, you'll find some that you like.<br>  <br>   What are things that I have to stop eating, that contain meat, that might seem like it doesn't? (what might 'secretly' contain meat?)<br>  A lot of soups and dishes that use broths contain chicken or beef broth. So watch out for that! I've had salads that contained little pieces of bacon that I didn't notice at first. Looking at the ingredients is your best bet.<br>  <br>  How much weight will I lose, because I exercise daily? (again, I'm not TRYING to lose weight, I'm just wondering if this will be the reason if I start losing the pounds.)<br>  You might lose a little weight. It probably won't be drastic though. Your cholesterol will probably go down, and you won't be eating as much fat. Being vegetarian is a very healthy diet, so if you weren't eating healthy before, you might lose a little weight.  <br>  <br>  YES! It is so worth it! I encourage you to try it. Being a vegetarian is beneficial in so many ways. Vegetarians have a proven longer life span, as well as a much lower risk of heart disease and other diseases. Not to mention how good you'll feel!<br>  :)

EyAAFfaMaa	I'm not a vegan, but I think I can help anyway. Try to take some Vitamin C and Iron vitamins. They will help. Try to get some omega-3 into your diet, try this by eating sushi or walnuts. Now, slowly transition back into those foods. Try by first eating an egg, it's good for you :) Then eat some cheese. Eat a bowl of cereal and milk one day. Try just leaving out meat, and eat everything else. Eat soy burgers (they're yummy), and fish. Then when you feel ready, eat a piece of meat. See how it feels. It isn't a big deal, you can live without meat, you'll be healthier when you eat animal products. If you're really against meat, sub with fish, soy, or chick'n. Chick'n is made of chick peas, and it tastes like meat (or better). Tofu is also pretty good. <br>  <br>  If your parents and your nutritionist say it's okay though, you can just start eating it. I think it's more that you don't really want to..or you don't want to let it go. Just slowly transition, you'll be fine :) Good luck! <br>  <br>  Oh, if you want to gain weight as a vegan, eat french fries daily :P Not the healthiest, but yummy and full of fat.|`|LEixu90naa	Return to vegetarian vs vegan and you can have animal proteins without the meat.

Eating meat doesn't make you thin or fat. You need to work on nutrition!|`|fZEVgFe8aa	My guess is after you try meat again a few times you won't like it or how it makes you feel.  But if you must, try cheeses, hard-boiled eggs, organic sausages, salmon, beef soups.  You don't have to go straight to the cow.  You need more nuts in your diet sweetstuff.  I am a longtime veg and raw foodie. I am 5'9 and weigh 125 lbs.  My lowest weight as an adult was 110 lbs.  Your weight also has to do with your muscles as well.  If your muscles aren't strong and healthy, you will weigh less.  You can't for sure go by what the scale says.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	If you have two doctors and a nutritionist advising you,  why are you asking for advice in a forum filled with amateurs?   I have been a vegetarian or vegan my entire life, and I'm extremely healthy.   Millions upon millions of people are vegetarian and healthy,  My doctor is a vegetarian, healthy, and specialized in clinical nutrition, having taught nutrition at the university level.    Since you said you are underweight,  you have not eaten enough food to be healthy either on a vegetarian or meat eating diet.   As you are interested in modeling, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you have been not eating right and trying to remain unnaturally skinny.   I'm sure the nutritionist must have said something about eating enough food for adequate nutrition.   Share this with your "nutritionist"   from registered dietitians at the American Dietetic Association <a href="http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf</a><br>  <br>  The bells and whistles on my bullschlit detector are going off.<br>  <br>  ** "my god why is everyone so hateful today<br>  "   I'm not hateful.  It's bulllschlit that 2 doctors and a nutritionist could be so ignorant to think that being underweight comes from a vegetarian diet.  I'm a tall 205 pound male who has eaten no meat for decades.   The idea that meat is the only place where one can get enough calories to maintain a healthy weight is ludicrous, and if that comes from doctors-- is the equivalent of either malpractice or sheer ignorance.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	for the anemia sip orange juice with meals to help absorb iron.<br>  eat 3 meals a day<br>  <br>  meat is not a magic cure for your immune system. if it was then meat eaters wouldn't get sick.<br>  <br>  raw fruits, vegetables, nuts are ideal for returning back to good health|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	you obviously weren't doing it right. if you want to remain vegan, actually start eating right. you are obvously eating junk and not enough iron-rich leafy greens and beans,<br>  <br>  <br>  iron pills don't replace the real thing(beans,leafy veggies,nuts)|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Just do it already.<br>  You might experience a bit of upset if you were to suddenly <br>  gorge yourself on a rack of greasy spare ribs, but slowly adding <br>  sensible portions of lean meats to your diet should give you <br>  no trouble at all.|`|1P5qWMQ0aa	This person wants to switch back for health reasons and your getting on her case.   This is one of two problems I have with vegans/vegetarians, you are all hypocrites.|`|kdSuwt8paa	I haven't heard of a gradual process to effect the change back to omnivore, but I am thinking of how a baby starts eating solid food very gradually.    I would start with dairy products.   Yoghurt would be easy on your digestion to start with.    Then try pancakes - that would mean you would be getting a small quantity of egg.  Things like biscuits and cakes made with butter and/or milk and egg would be easy on you to start with too, and a scrape of butter on your bread and toast.  Once you are eating the same amounts of dairy food as the rest of your family (in about a week I expect) you could start on small helpings of whatever meat they are having.    Keep up with eating a tub of yoghurt every day and gradually increase your meat intake.    You don't have to have meat every day even if you are an omnivore!   If you take it slowly you will know if any of the food doesn't agree with you, and you can reduce the quantity.  Good luck.|`|vtFbGgTRaa	I have thassalanemia minor so when I was vegan I got really sick (it is not iron related) and soy made me sick. Anyways just slowly eat meat I will warn you it will taste gross for a little but keep trying! Good luck. I only eat meat once a week or so and that seems to keep me healthy<br>  <br>  <br>  ALSO you may have developed lactose intolerance so I would avoid dairy except for yogurt until your body is used to the meat etc and then test dairy and se if you have an allergic response. Good luck

5zNwBQZHaa	Sauerkraut - most fermented foods are pretty good for us.  In addition to fiber, it also contains Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Iron.<br>  <br>  A 3.5 ounce serving only has about 20 calories in it and more than half of those calories are from fiber which won't be absorbed by your body anyway.  So it is very low calorie.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Extremely low in calories... it has fiber and vitamins in it (since it's cabbage)|`|2b7ErdOqaa	Sauerkraut is a very healthy food for anyone except those that have to watch their salt intake.  The brining is high in sodium.<br>  <br>  But there have been studies that link sauerkraut with fighting cancer so not only does it have a lot of good vitamins in it, the antioxidents in it are good for fighting things in your body.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA10187219	It is spelled Sauerkraut.  And it is very healthy for you.  Essentially, it is pickled cabbage.  Today, in the USA, we tend to use it as a Hot dog topping.  But for generations, it has served as a reasonable substitute for meat when times get tough.<br>  <br>  One of my favorite meals is still pork chops, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.  I know! it sounds awful, but I grew up with it and still love it.|`|XEAq2AtMaa	Yes even the bacteria in Sauerkraut is healthy because it helps your digestive system.  The only drawback is that it is loaded with salt so you should eat it in moderation.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	yes , good for you

Usually, it will say calories for mix alone, and then with added ingredients....  Trying to make Hamburger Helper "healthy" though is difficult, since it contains so much sodium & carbs.  You should try making skillet casseroles from scratch, so you can control the rest of the ingredients.  Or, just BBQ hamburgers made with extra-lean ground beef......In general, casseroles are much more fattening than entree & sides done separately

hHCdXq0Naa	If you like wheat bread, it should be fine.  Personally, I prefer white or sourdough though.  You need to thaw bacon before you cook it (either in a frying pan or the microwave)|`|fEBOzWeXaa	if you like whole wheat bread it will be fabulous.  that is the nice part about whole wheat breat, it has lots of its own flavor unlike your basic white Wonder bread which is a tasteless sponge.  I personally feel that whole wheat bread inproves all sandwiches.<br>  To cook frozen bacon, lay it in a pan and turn on the heat.  As it fries, slowly by the way, the thawed, partially fried peices will come loose from the whole bunch. just move those to the side and keep frying.<br>  You can also quick thaw the bacon in the microwave and then fry.|`|53giV6PFaa	Any kind of bread would work with this since it's just a simple turkey club, it's up to what you prefer.<br>  <br>  As for the bacon, you will need to thaw it first, then cook it, because you cannot separate the bacon slices while it's frozen solid.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Yes you can substitute whole wheat bread , <br>  cook bacon in the oven ,on a cookie pan  lay the bacon side by side, bake until brown .I would put the oven for the bacon for about 400 degrees|`|AA12336927	Of course,the whole wheat will make it better. The frozen bacon however ... you may want to drop SEALED into a pan of cold water to help along the thawing

b9wICW1Paa	If you are eating enough fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains, then fiber is not something you need to be to supplementing with.  In fact, you could be causing or exacerbating constipation.  I know from experience that too much fiber can be just as bad, and even worse than, too little fiber.  <br>  <br>  If you need to use up what you have, you might consider dumping it on the compost pile, if you have one.|`|nvH62xo5aa	it's better than nothing.|`|2Av3gIqgaa	Not sure about your question but if you are looking for a good fiber supplement, I love the chewable Fiber Choice with Calcium and Vitamin D.  They are mixed berry flavor and they taste really good.  They aren't chalky or nasty or smell bad.  I don't even like fruit and I like them.  <br>  <br>  I don't think that you would get less of the fiber by putting it in your cereal.  I wouldn't think so since most people end up drinking the milk after their cereal anyway.  So, I think that if you add the fiber to the cereal and then finish everything in the bowl that you are getting all of the fiber.<br>  <br>  Try the Fiber Smart though.  Good luck.|`|QlBLZ4tVaa	It should be okay to add it to your cereal or any other food. Just be sure to drink plenty of liquids.|`|u5WLzvJAaa	by powdered fibre I guess you mean Bran -  its a perfectly natural fibre and good for all of us.|`|ta1d1wjEaa	NO|`|t41DmHwPaa	The sugar and the milk might bring down the fiber; but i think u will b okay.

RbSa5YNSaa	I like French women!|`|AA12198711	Gratin Dauphinois Recipe<br>  <br>  This gratin Dauphinois recipe is the ultimate comfort food. Potatoes are double-cooked in seasoned cream and then baked with Gruyere cheese until the gratin is butter-soft. This recipe is the ultimate version of classic potatoes au gratin.<br>  <br>  Cook's note: This is a great make-ahead side dish. Simply refrigerate it for up to 1 day before the final baking stage.<br>  <br>      * 5 cups whole milk<br>      * 2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/4 inch slices<br>      * 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br>      * 1 1/2 cups crème fraiche (substitute sour cream)<br>      * 1 teaspoon salt<br>      * 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>      * 1/16 teaspoon (pinch) freshly grated nutmeg<br>      * 2 tablespoons butter, softened<br>      * 2/3 cup grated Gruyere cheese<br>  <br>  In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring the potatoes and milk to a gentle simmer. Continue simmering the potatoes for 15 minutes, until they just start to turn tender.<br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 350F. Drain the milk from the pan and add the heavy cream, crème fraiche, salt, pepper, and nutmeg to the hot potatoes. Heat the cream-crème fraiche to just under a simmer (a few bubbles are fine) for 10-15 minutes, until the potatoes are very tender, but not falling apart.<br>  <br>  Butter a large baking dish and spread the potato-cream mixture into the dish. Sprinkle the Gruyere cheese over the potatoes and bake for 20-25 minutes, until the potatoes are golden brown on top.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sausage Baked In Pastry Crust<br>  (Saucisson en Croute)  <br>  <br>  # 1?-to 2-pound uncooked plain or garlic pork sausage, about 12 inches long and 2 inches in diameter, fresh or smoked (French, Italian or Polish)<br>  # Water<br>  # Pate Brisee<br>  # 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water<br>  # Dijon-style prepared mustard<br>    <br>   With the point of a sharp knife, prick the sausage in 5 or 6 places to prevent the skin from bursting, and to release its fat when it cooks. Lay the sausage flat in a large, deep skillet and add enough cold water to cover it completely. Bring to a boil over moderate heat and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes. Transfer the sausage to paper towels to drain and cool. Then split the skin with a sharp knife and peel it off.<br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 375°. Roll the Pate Brisee out 1/8 inch thick in a rectangular shape large enough to wrap around the sausage (about 8 inches long and 15 inches wide). Center the cooled sausage on the rectangle. Cut triangles of pastry from each corner of the roll and gently, without stretching the dough, lift the long sides of the pastry up over the sausage. The pastry should overlap by about an inch on top; trim off anything more than that with a knife. Brush the lower edge of the pastry with the egg-water mixture and press the upper edge down upon it firmly to secure it.<br>  <br>  Brush the envelope like flaps at the ends of the roll with a little egg mixture, then lift the flaps up over the ends of the sausage and tuck the edges in neatly to seal them. Turn the wrapped sausage over and place it seam-side down on a buttered baking sheet. Cut the pastry scraps into decorative shapes such as half moons, diamonds or leaves and arrange these on top of the roll, sealing them in place with the egg-water mixture. With a pastry brush, coat the whole roll with the rest of the egg mixture. Bake the roll on the middle shelf of the oven for 45 to 60 minutes or until it is golden brown.<br>  <br>   Transfer the roll to a large platter and serve it cut into ?-inch slices. Pass the mustard separately.

I'm a peanut butter fan, though, so I just load it on anyways.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Put a thin layer of peanut butter on one piece of bread, making sure to go all the way to the edges.  Put a medium layer of jelly on top of the peanut butter, leaving an un-jellied space about 1/2" wide all the way around. Then put a thin layer of peanut butter on the other piece of bread, again making sure to cover all the way to the edges.  Put the jellied piece of bread on the counter (or plate) and carefully align the un-jellied piece over the top of it.  Slowly lower the bread topper down, keeping the proper alignment at all times.  When the bread topper has made contact with the bottom piece, do not press down in the middle, but do press down lightly around all of the edges, insuring a tight seal between the pieces of bread.<br>  That accomplished, the bread will not slide no matter how you handle the sandwich.  In addition, the jelly will not squirt out the back of the sandwich when you bite into the front of the sandwich, unless you have piled an inordinate amount of jelly into the middle of the peanut butter.<br>  Science is fun.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	the thing is, if you put the peanut butter on first, then the jelly and then of course the second slice of bread and then turn the sandwich over, now you have the jelly first.......|`|Ppstz3lCaa	peanut butter.<br>  not too much jelly <br>  definitely strawberry|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Peanut butter sticks to the bread better than jelly, so do it first.|`|gpON465Iaa	PB cause when you get it on your knife and then transport some to the jelly that is refrigerated, no problem, but if you start with the jelly and then transport the jelly to the PB jar, big problem.|`|ws0nvFi5aa	peanut butter, or you can put peanut butter on one bread and jelly on the other and put it together|`|3eKaATFtaa	I think Peanut Butter <br>  <br>  Now im gonna go make one<br>  <br>  want me to make you one too lol|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Peanut butter.

8qZrlz07aa	Well there are two types of frosting you can use.  A simple sugar base or a buttercream frosting.  <br>  I have a recipe for each of them on my site <a href="http://www.birthday-cake-central.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthday-cake-central.com</a> at the frosting page <a href="http://www.birthday-cake-central.com/birthday-cake-recipe.html#vanilla" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthday-cake-central.com/bir...</a><br>  <br>  The real difference that stands out between the two is ease of preparation.  The easy vanilla frosting is something you can whip up pretty fast and have ready to go in a pinch.  The second, the buttercream, takes a little more work but is a creamier, richer frosting.<br>  <br>  Both are good, neither is hard to make.

3yEh8X9Caa	"refrigerate or freeze ground beef or hamburger as soon as possible after purchase. This preserves freshness and slows growth of bacteria. It can be refrigerated or frozen in its original packaging if the meat will be used soon. If refrigerated, keep at 40 ?°F or below and use within 1 or 2 days. For longer freezer storage, wrap in heavy-duty plastic wrap, aluminum foil, freezer paper, or plastic bags made for freezing. Ground beef is safe indefinitely if kept frozen, but will lose quality over time. It is best if used within 4 months. Mark your packages with the date they were placed in the freezer so you can keep track of storage times".|`|eAobNmUTaa	This is totally okay.  :)|`|kkVHXm1Kaa	i only leave it in for 3 days max. so if it is alright i am glad i learned this|`|4VQZuH9vaa	couple of days|`|n1D90COxaa	it was fine..|`|x2mgUMb6aa	it is ok,but i wouldn't keep it in fridge longer than 5 days without cooking it.<br>  you can then freeze it.

ylJoUuMDaa	Here's your answer.<br>  <br>  The Sugar Act<br>  Titled The American Revenue Act of 1764<br>  On April 5, 1764, Parliament passed a modified version of the Sugar and Molasses Act (1733), which was about to expire. Under the Molasses Act colonial merchants had been required to pay a tax of six pence per gallon on the importation of foreign molasses. But because of corruption, they mostly evaded the taxes and undercut the intention of the tax — that the English product would be cheaper than that from the French West Indies. This hurt the British West Indies market in molasses and sugar and the market for rum, which the colonies had been producing in quantity with the cheaper French molasses. The First Lord of the Treasury, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Grenville was trying to bring the colonies in line with regard to payment of taxes. He had beefed up the Navy presence and instructed them to become more active in customs enforcement. Parliament decided it would be wise to make a few adjustments to the trade regulations. The Sugar Act reduced the rate of tax on molasses from six pence to three pence per gallon, while Grenville took measures that the duty be strictly enforced. The act also listed more foreign goods to be taxed including sugar, certain wines, coffee, pimiento, cambric and printed calico, and further, regulated the export of lumber and iron. The enforced tax on molasses caused the almost immediate decline in the rum industry in the colonies. The combined effect of the new duties was to sharply reduce the trade with Madeira, the Azores, the Canary Islands, and the French West Indies (Guadelupe, Martinique and Santo Domingo (now Haiti)), all important destination ports for lumber, flour, cheese, and assorted farm products. The situation disrupted the colonial economy by reducing the markets to which the colonies could sell, and the amount of currency available to them for the purchase of British manufactured goods. This act, and the Currency Act, set the stage for the revolt at the imposition of the Stamp Act.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	The British King always taxed the colonies on everything they exported to the mother country.

Slowly add milk, stirring constantly, then add your cheese. Let the cheese melt evenly, add as much as you'd like, if it seems too globby, you can add some more milk. also salt and pepper if desired. keep cooking until it's the way you like it. I like putting chili powder in it to make it hotter, but you can do with it what you will, it's all about personal taste|`|yUUWKk9vaa	Well, not really. You definitely need milk, to thin the cheese out and to get a less grainy consistency. And definitely melt it in a saucepan, if you do it in a microwave the cheese gets all hard and icky and the milk and cheese don't combine well.<br>  <br>  I would approximate 1/2 cup milk to 2 cups cheese, melted in a saucepan and stirred occasionally. Adjust cheese levels as necessary for your desired consistency.|`|1AyRPRSOaa	Big Cheese Squeeze<br>  <br>  (Recipe courtesy of Alton Brown) <br>  <br>  Show:  Good Eats<br>  <br>  Episode:  Cable in the Classroom <br>  <br>  <br>   There are times (your team just lost by a lousy field goal) when our appetites should be free to comfort us without having to bow to the culinary censorship of our consciousness. What could possibly get us through the winters of our discontent like the warm embrace of melted cheese nestled between perfectly crisped bookends of toast. That’s right: nothing.<br>    <br>  2 slices of bread, cut thin (as far as bread selection goes, all I'll say is the bigger the loaf the bigger the sandwich) <br>  <br>  1 teaspoon (or more) smooth Dijon mustard <br>  <br>  1 cup Grated cheese (This is the soul of the thing, so use the good stuff. We like a semi-hard, semi-soft combo like smoked gouda and Gruyere or Fontina with a young Asiago. If you're a purist , go for the Cheddar, but make it sharp and aged if possible. <br>  <br>  Good quality olive oil for spritzing.<br>  <br>  Find 2 heavy skillets that will nest together. Two (10-inch) cast iron skillets are ideal. Heat them over high heat. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, spread mustard on one slice of bread. Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread. <br>  <br>  Spritz the bread surface that's staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer. A light coat will do, don't soak. <br>  <br>  When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down in the middle of one pan. (if your pans are a different size, this would be the smaller one.) Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet. Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich. If the top pan isn't cast iron, weigh it down with a brick, can, or something of similar heft. <br>  <br>  Wait patiently, crack a beer. When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it's done. This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  Carefully remove the top skillet, (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it). Just look at it. It's perfect...better than mom's. (no reason to tell her) <br>  <br>  Remove to a plate, count to 10 and slice it in half. Take a bite. Take another. So they lost... there's always next year.|`|PMwg1hWAaa	Your telling us not to tell you the only possible answers!  If you melt shredded cheese, it will only have a creamy consistency for no more than a minute, then it will be hard as a rock.

Stir in the flour, being sure to combine it with the butter very well, to make a roux. Let cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. Do not let it darken. Gradually add the milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking or stirring vigorously to incorporate. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until thickened and just starting to boil, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the cheese and stir until melted.

AA10027242	Try to get things in the 365 Organic store brand.  It's usually quite a bit cheaper.  Also, check out the bulk bins.  You can get things like grains, beans, nuts, granola, and snacks for much cheaper than the prepackaged version.|`|dYvKr5yeaa	Most everything at Whole Foods is organic.  This may not mean much to you, but it costs farmers and processors a lot of money to be able to legally call their products organic, so you're expected to pay a little extra.  Their staff is also much more trained than your average grocery store, with much of their meat products cut up on site, and training courses for other areas.<br>  <br>  As to what is "worth" it, well, that's a matter of opinion.  Everything is expensive everywhere, but as with any store, the key to shopping at Whole Foods is to pay attention to what's on sale, as their sale prices are usually BIG discounts.  Whole Foods brings in a lot of spices, vegetables, fruits and more you won't easily find anywhere else, not to mention it's one of the only places you can reliably get things like wild caught salmon, FRESH meat, and an enormous variety of cheeses -- some more expensive than others.<br>  <br>  It's purely a matter of taste.  If fancy or organic ingredients don't matter that much to you, then go ahead and bypass it for another store.  However, if organic is important, or if you're just looking for quality, you really can't beat the place.  I "treat" myself to a shop there once every other month or so, and everything I have gotten has always been top notch.

Try the Kraft website, most everything is easy there. Campbell's soup is a good easy site, also. <br>  another trick is to figure out what you would like to eat, type the brand name into the browser, and likely whatever brand name you want has a website. <br>  Gee even a particular food. I wanted a recipe for catfish, and got the association website, with recipes. <br>  Swiss steak, Husband's delight from allrecipes.com, chili, spagetti with meat sauce, all easy and quick. A salad, some fruit, and you are done. <br>  Wish you would have said some things that you like to eat, beef, pork, I could have been more help.<br>  Here is a recipe for beef that even fooled my very good cook aunt, she thought I slaved over the stove. It can be altered to feed you for a few meals, or feed Mom and Dad when they come to call. <br>  You need a big heavy skillet or a dutch oven, a big spatula, a big spoon, a measure cup and a sharp knife some Crisco or some olive oil, some flour, an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix, a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup water, and somewhere between one and 2 pounds of good round steak. <br>  Preheat your pan with  just enough oil to coat it. Cut the round steak up into pieces that look like they would be 3 or 4 bites. Dredge them both sides into the flour, and put them into the grease that has been heated to about medium. Brown them lightly on both sides. Turn down the heat, mix the soups and the water in a bowl, stir it into the beef, and turn the heat to simmer. Cook it at least an 1 and a 1/2, 2 for a bigger steak,and stir it a couple times. You do not want the heat so high that the gravy pops bubbles, just nice slow steady heat. <br>  Serve this with mashed potatoes, rice, a veggie of your choice, even a salad. <br>  This recipe has an easy quick prep, it does not take long. and you can walk away from it and come back. If you have a crock pot you can use it, but you still have to brown the meat. <br>  Some quick and easy is a Boboli crust, some pizza sauce, and the toppings of your choice. Bake it, and you have supper, fix a salad or fruit. <br>  Mac and cheese made with Velveeta is always easy.<br>  Chili with pasta works.<br>  Soup is easy, especially chicken, use some chicken broth, add cooked noodles or potatoes, vegetables, even use chicken that has already been cooked, try some poultry seasoning, some salt and pepper, and all you need is a sandwich to go with it. <br>  Need a dessert? Ice cream pie is so easy, all you need is a bought cookie or graham cracker crust, some softened ice cream that goes with the crust you picked, Oreo sounds particularly good right now, crush the oreos and make your own crust, and reserve some for sprinkling on top of the pie, or make a layer of them in between 2 layers of ice cream. , any kind you want, buy the ice cream topping of your choice fudge would go good with the oreo, and at the last minute, put on some whipped cream, the canned stuff works fine.

Yum , now I feel like poached eggs lol.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	use a tsp of white vinegar, so that when you put the egg in the water it will stay together, you can really use any vinegar as long as your not using it longer than a hour or the yolks will turn green inside|`|KgtlyWDXaa	The balsamic vinegar will flavor the eggs.

You start by cutting the cornbeef into a few chunks [ but not right through ]. Get a big pot or slow cooker and put your cornbeef in with potatoes, pumpkin, carrots [ all cut into reasonably large chunks ] Cover the cornbeef and veges with water and add pepper, soya sauce, a bit of honey or sugar and bring to the boil if in a pot.  In a slow cooker you would use slightly less water and turn it on low and forget for a couple of hours.  When the pot boils turn down to a simmer and simmer away gently for a couple of hours.  Now is the time to add the sliced cabbage.  Do not slice the cabbage too thin - the magic of boil up is ruined if things are too small when they go in....  Keep a lid on pot or slow cooker till dinner time.  Stir every half hour or so.  Simply delicious and nutritious....  It probably takes 6 hours whether by pot or slow cooker.....|`|1AyRPRSOaa	Recipes for Corned Beef<br>  <br>  Different ways of Prepering Corned Beef<br>  <br>  Making the Perfect Corned Beef and Cabbage<br>  <br>  Dublin Corned Beef<br>  <br>  Old Fashioned Corned Beef<br>  <br>  The History of Corned Beef<br>  <br>  Back to Top<br>  <br>  Preparation<br>  Corned beef is made from one of several less-tender cuts of beef like the brisket, rump or round. Therefore, it requires long, moist cooking. Keep food safety in mind when preparing the corned beef. It can be cooked on top of the stove or in the oven, microwave or slow cooker (see information below).<br>  <br>  "Fork-tender" is a good indication of doneness, but use a meat thermometer to be sure. Cook until the internal temperature has reached at least 160 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Corned beef may still be pink in color after cooking. This does not mean it is not done. Nitrite is used in the curing process. This fixes pigment in the meat and affects the color.<br>  <br>  Allow the brisket to stand for about ten minutes after removing from the heat. This will make it easier to slice, and it is best sliced diagonally across the grain of the meat.<br>  <br>  Cooking Times<br>  <br>  <br>  The USDA does not recommend one particular cooking method as best. Following are methods from various sources. The cooking times are based on corned beef that is not frozen at the time of cooking. Whichever method you choose, be sure the beef reaches an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F to ensure it is safely cooked.<br>  <br>  OVEN: Set the oven for 350 degrees F or no lower than 325 degrees F. Place brisket fat-side up. Barely cover the meat with water -- about one inch -- and keep the container covered throughout the cooking time. Allow about one hour per pound.<br>  <br>  <br>  STOVE TOP: Place brisket fat-side up in a large pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil; then reduce the heat and simmer, allowing about one hour per pound. Vegetables may be added during the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking. Cook to desired tenderness.<br>  <br>  <br>  SLOW COOKER: If using root vegetables, put them in the bottom of slow cooker. Cut brisket into pieces of like size to ensure thorough cooking. Place brisket on top of vegetables (if using) or in bottom of cooker. Add about 1-1/2 cups of water or enough to cover meat. Cover and cook on high setting for the first hour of cooking. Then cook for 10 to 12 hours on the low setting or 5 to 6 hours on high. Cabbage wedges may be added on top of the brisket during the last three hours of cooking.<br>  <br>  <br>  MICROWAVE: Calculate cooking time at 20 to 30 minutes per pound. Place brisket in a large casserole dish and add 1-1/2 cups of water. Cover with lid or vented plastic wrap and microwave on medium-low (30 percent power) for half the estimated time. Turn meat over and rotate dish. Microwave on high for remainder of time or until fork tender. Vegetables may be added during the final 30 minutes of cooking.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cooking Ahead<br>  Some consumers prefer to cook corned beef ahead of time. It is easier to cut uniform slices when corned beef is cold. Cooking ahead also makes it easier to reheat and serve later.<br>  <br>  After cooking a whole corned beef, cut it into several pieces for faster cooling -- or slice it, if you like. Place the beef in small, shallow containers and cool it in the refrigerator quickly.<br>  <br>  Leftovers<br>  Any corned beef left over from a meal should be refrigerated promptly -- within two hours of cooking or reheating. Use cooked-ahead or leftover corned beef within 3 to 4 days or freeze up to 2 months.<br>  <br>  Back to Top<br>  <br>  Courtesy of The USDA website<br>  <br>  Using a clove studded orange<br>  <br>  I have read some recipes that use a orange and roll it to release the juices inside. Then they stud with cloves and then cut in half. Then they squeeze the juice into the pot and drop the studded orange halves in the pot and then add your water and boil the beef.<br>  <br>  For additional food safety information about meat, poultry, or eggs, call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1 (800) 535-4555; Washington, DC area, (202) 720-3333; TTY: 1 (800) 256-7072.

Baking powder contains baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) as well as other ingredients. Not the other way around.|`|BKsrKTIuaa	Baking powder is a leavening agent or rising agent. Some others are baking soda, yeast, beaten egg whites and other things. With out it your cookies will be thin, flat, hard and heavy, instead of light and/or crunchy. Baking powder is relatively slow acting, especially when compared to baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda, a base, and cream of tartar, an acid, when mixed with a liquid the two combine and a gas, carbon dioxide,CO2, is released. The tiny bubbles make the dough rise. The liquid is usually added last thing before baking so the bubbles don't just dissipate into the air. The cookies go into a hot oven so the dough begins to set up and the bubbles separate the small particles of firm dough instead of just being baked as bubbles into the otherwise hard cookie.<br>  In a bread dough yeast, a one celled plant, is used, as the yeast grows in the dough it releases CO2, in bread you want the big bubbles and that is why you let the dough rise before baking. Without the baking powder you are going to wind up with sweet hard tack and I don't care how sweet it is hard tack is still hardtack. Maybe if you are running away from Egyptians you could keep the kids happy with some sweet unleavened bread.|`|KgtlyWDXaa	You cookies will be very flat and because they have no lift they may not bake evenly.  There is no adequate substitution for baking soda.|`|QQbSIrBxaa	If you have baking powder you can mix that with cream of tarter to get "baking soda"

Don't stretch the dough; if it's too small, just put it back on the board and re-roll it.<br>  <br>  Fill the pie with the apple mixture. Brush the edge of the bottom pie crust with the egg wash so the top crust will adhere. Top with the second crust and trim the edges to about 1-inch over the rim.

Brush the entire top crust with the egg wash, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar, and cut 4 or 5 slits.<br>  <br>  Place the pie on a sheet pan and bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the crust is browned and the juices begin to bubble out.

Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out on a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough to make sure it doesn't stick to the board.

These are the companies we must boycott. I've had luck convincing Progresso to label their food 'vegetarian and vegan" and using "natural flavors from non-animal/meat sources". I recommend buying NOTHING that says "natural flavors"! Don't we have the right to know what we are buying and putting in our bodies? The FDA doesn't think so!<br>  They label rennet as "enzymes' !|`|sMTVcfiVaa	Sometimes companies actually list rennet in the ingredients, but in general, it's safe to assume that items that have real cheese (not powdered or fake cheese) have a good chance of having rennet in it. According to the Vegetarian Society, there is no "normal" cheese on the market that is always vegetarian. <br>  <br>  As the other poster mentioned, keep your eye open for fish products in products you wouldn't expect to find fish, such as multivitamins. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't worry about these things too much because there is really very, very little animal by-product. Still, it's better to avoid it if you can. As a Wisconsinite, I try not to ever think about rennet. <3|`|HHmz4Rsfaa	u might want 2 check 4 flax oil aka fish oil....|`|Ohcyim3Kaa	I agree with Billy.  If people are serious about this, the additive "natural flavors" has to be avoided.  Unfortunately, this includes a large chunk or processed foods, including salad dressing, tomato sauce, ketchup, on and on and on.|`|UlN4EACsaa	eggs, and whey
8VZeJ2KZaa	Their all fruit smoothies and protein berry workout (with soy protein) are vegetarian and vegan. You can get the other smoothies without yogurt. <br>  Probably the easiest way is to request for them to made without yogurt.|`|MW71fAdeaa	ummm...idk but u should def. try mango-a-go-go
XFZmAMOAaa	I'm a member of R.F.P.(rights for plants).They have lives too you know.|`|ykP7I3caaa	Eating the meat would include having the animal killed.<br>  <br>  Eating eggs from a chicken or a cow who had a good life I don't see why not. Like my question,<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj9MNytA.e0cDn8uWoBlAPvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307154358AALVeLW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Some people are vegan for health issues. Allergies etc.|`|gntFLkOgaa	Actually I have been a vegetarian basically all my life and it is because I think that animals lives have merit too.<br>  <br>  I have never forced my belief on others though, including my husband or child.|`|8dfca7e2b1f09cef17816b68835e11f5aa	Wake up redneck ! Killing animals is always wrong and no-one gets a toaster oven if they 'recruit" a new vegan!|`|sMTVcfiVaa	Ok first, don't judge vegans saying that they FORCE their beliefs on the "rest of us." Seriously. How many vegans are strapping you to a chair and shoving carrots down your throat? None. I wish everyone would stop saying this because it's just an ignorant statement. Think before you speak.<br>  <br>  Now then.<br>  <br>  If, somehow, all animals were given better living conditions, then yeah, some vegans might go back to eating animals. But to be honest, it's not always about the animals' quality of life as a primary reason to be vegan. Personally, I don't eat animals because, morally, I don't feel that any animal should have to be killed for that reason. Even if animals were all living in the wild before they were slaughtered and had the fullest possible lives, I still wouldn't eat meat. It's just how I live my life. To most non-meat eaters, there are many, many reasons to be a vegetarian/vegan. It's a personal choice that millions have made and it has NOTHING to do with YOU. So the answer to your question is no.
Nk9jElJjaa	heavenly. seriously though, its really good. its just garbanzo beans pureed with tahini (sesame seed puree) and they usually add garlic and salt, maybe other herbs and seasonings. so its usually kinda garlicky but go to trader joes and they have a million different types. anyway its REALLY good....kinda beany tasting if you like it :)|`|TAgAnfIbaa	really good! my husband is lebanese and i learned to make it . it has tahini in it and it taste like peanut butter but it is crushed sesame seed. also it is really good for you try it with pita chips you can find that in any deli section. also another to try is baba ganosh it is smoked eggplant mixed with tahini lemon and garlic. enjoy!|`|ozWi3TJlaa	It's delicious.  It's thick and creamy and garlicky and lemony with a hint of sesame and is really good on baked pita chips or just chunks torn off warmed pita bread.|`|8dfca7e2b1f09cef17816b68835e11f5aa	Creamy, nutty, salty- very good ! If you eat it with corn chips it's a perfect protein!|`|6ccuJbLbaa	If you know what chikpeas taste like then it kind of tastes like that. It is simply amazing. lol. Try it with pita bread!|`|XHnpraaxaa	It does depend on who makes it if it is any good.  There is many kinds as well.  I had a taste at a Food Show of a few flavors.  Mine is the Greek one and I do not like the others at all.  I find mine in the deli section cold counter.  It is made in Michigan and I believe the name is Garden Fresh.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	It's delicious! I make every day, here is my recipe, it takes about 5 minutes to make, eat it as a dip or in a sandwich with cold cuts...<br>  1 can chick peas<br>  1 heaping tsp tahini sesame paste<br>  1 clove of garlic, minced<br>  1 tsp cumin powder<br>  Small pinch of salt<br>  1 tablespoon good cider vinegar or lemon juice<br>  1-2 sundried tomatoes and some of the oil<br>  Blend everything smooth, enjoy!|`|5c4565841ff39f9d2aaf978980335d5eaa	Amazing! lol<br>  <br>  Sabra's Classic, Mediterrainan Hummus is the best in my opinion. I eat it with carrots, Pita chips, or toasted Vegetable Wheat Thins. I'm sure there are many other thigns you can try it with too. <br>  <br>  It tastes creamy and smooth. The taste also reminds me of beans because its made with chickpeas.|`|2RzEaod9aa	MAGIC.<br>  <br>  I eat it everyday that I can. I buy it by the tub. It's so freakin' delicious. It's made from chickpeas and tahini (sesame paste) and seasonings and other ingredients depending on what kind it is (roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, etc.). I was eating it today just by scooping some out with my fingers. It's THAT good.|`|aBtUtnKtaa	It's very good but I don't know what to compare it to. You will just have to try some. Most shops have it in the deli section, or you can make some like my bf does.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Why not buy some and try it?
