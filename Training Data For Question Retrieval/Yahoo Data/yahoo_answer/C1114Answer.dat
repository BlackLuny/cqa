pVwyu6Fuaa	Hi Clueless,<br>  <br>  what you want is something to weigh your hair down.<br>  Make sure you keep getting it thinned out by your stylist, but when you by your hair products, aim for shampoos and conditioners for dry hair. I say this because they have more moisture, conditioning elements to them which will weigh your hair down, not make it more volumous.<br>  Also ask your hair stylist what you can buy to further weigh it down.<br>  Good luck!|`|STd3geMxaa	herbal essences dangerously straight<br>  its good stuff

dxMQAdndaa	Yes, you can do it at Claire's. What they will do is clean your ear, mark the area, and use a gun. The gun makes a loud pop, but it honestly does not hurt that badly. The only thing I would make sure of is that the gun is clean and sterilized. Every time I have gotten my ears pierced (I have three in each ear and one cartilage) they have sterlized the needle on the gun as well. <br>  <br>  Also, they will give you a solution to clean your piercing, but for faster healing with less drying out, I would use Neosporin. It helped make the area less tender. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|loqsl5xXaa	go to a place that uses a needle so it is less damaging to your ear and will be easier to take. also after u get it done they don't want u to sleep on that side cause of all the movement you do can effect the ear piercing, what i did is i took a washcloth and folded it long ways and then bent it like a hose shoe and put it around the outside of my ear so i wasn't touching the pillow with the ear. it was awkward the 1st time but after that it was ok.|`|1ss17pyzaa	yes you can. and I would do one at a time because it bruises pretty bad and it is pretty painful to sleep on and use to talk on the phone. I got both done at Claire's in 2000.|`|ZO4fBiOSaa	yea u can but i wouldnt. go to like a tattoo/piercing parlor for your cartilage<br>  <br>  i got mine perced at claires n it got infected|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Do NOT do it.<br>  Yes, Claire's does it...but they also do it with a piercing gun, which causes blunt force trama to your ear. Go to a shop and have it done with a needle. It will probably cost more, but would you rather have a sales associate taught to hold a gun to someones ear forcing a earing through an extreamly sensitive area or a person who does it for a living putting a needle though?|`|07YBD5mJaa	Thats where I had mine done, no problems what so ever through them. They do it pretty fast, with the gun. Mine did not hurt at all, a little sting but thats all. They sent me home with a cleaning solution and all, great service.<br>  Best wishes!|`|pqlhPnexaa	No, you should not go to Claire's to get your cartilidge pierced. The thing about a place like Claire's is that the people who work there are not trained in piercing, as well as the fact that piercing with a gun can be extremely harmful to the cartilidge.<br>  <br>  Go to a place and get it done: while it might be quicker and easier to go to Claire's, your piercing will look SO much better for having been done right.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bae3b34f8cfcdb7878e0d8bfe7de1948aa	You COULD. But DONT! I am going to copy and paste a answer I gave not too long ago, so some of the stuff may not relate to you, but I was adressing someone who already got theirs done at Claire's.<br>  <br>  Never AGAIN get your cartilage pierced with a GUN. Even getting your lobe done with a gun is kinda odd (but too late for many of us to go back to change that huh?) I can't imagine how s/he got into position to even pierce your cartilage with a gun! You went to Claire's didn't you? Using a gun on cartilage can shatter the surrounding cartilage in your ear and near the piercing. it's very dangerous not to mention cause scarring! It should have been done with a needle by a professional. (not trying to bash you here)That line is now a bruise because they at least have to keep your ear steady. A clamp was used on my ear when I got my industrial and it hurt like hell but left no bruise. Your ear is probably too "young" to be infected so quickly. it's probably just very irritated. Keep your hair and pillows, phones, etc away from it and use sea salt soaks on it (use google to find correct measurements) Even just putting a hot/warm washcloth on your ear will help. Stop Turning it as well. It's unecessary and painful, and if you don't clean all the crust or soap off you can bring it back into your ear when turning. And plus it moves when you clean it anyway. Jewelry used today is nonporous and your skin grows around it anyway. I hope you start to feel better. If after a month or two you are still in excruciating pain then ask a professional piercer to look at it. Also check to see if your skin isn't just reacting to the soap you're using. My skin was too sensitive for Dial Antibacterial and it inflammed SO bad, so I just bought this expensive stuff called Satin and it's all better.|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Yes, you can get it done at Claire's.<br>  Its like a burst of burning at first, but its really fast, safe and easy.|`|1thElV58aa	yes
swAONFfEaa	i used it once and it did make my hair kind of dry...but if you have naturally oily hair then you should get it...its cool because once you scrub it in it makes your head all cold...it feels like your head just got rained on and now you're stuck in a mini snowstorm occurring only on your scalp. ugh i hate the word "scalp" but i've said "head" too many times...anyway yeah.
AKKDXZxZaa	mousse<br>  or get it thinned^^|`|154dzJ1Faa	Without seeing what you mean, I really can't give any specific directions.  But it all depends on the cut and how you style it.<br>  <br>  If the hair is short enough that the hair can stand up, it is going to do that.  When the hair gets longer, the weight will pull it down.  If you have curl, it puffs up the hair, and will look puffy when it is longer.  You must also style the hair in the direction it grows.  If you looked closely, you will see that it usually spirals in the crown (we all have a different spot) and that it probably will lay down better if you comb the hair in that direction.  By combing your hair against the direction of growth, you are making it stick up more.  So you have the final control of what it does.
RYLkjYkIaa	Just dont wear them and be yourself and ask that guy, he will like u as u are|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	Heels are fine. wear them|`|p0mCoRyMaa	i think yes! your lucky you can too, i go to a private school in australia that has a uniform :l but we still find school shoes that have heels ;)<br>  go for it and good luck!|`|pqlhPnexaa	Heels are fine. I know lots of people who wear them.

Wpq4qUllaa	i have a mono speedy 30 and LOVE IT, i find it's practical so get alot of use out of it<br>  I'm not a huge fan of te neverful because it's an open bag and just don't think i'd get along with it<br>  it also depends on your size, if you're quite small go for the speedy :)|`|AA12133586	tote bag is more functional and more space , but u can go wrong with a LV bag|`|dtt9r8Ehaa	I have the Speedy 30 in Damier Canvas. I like it a lot. If you don't have the tote one, get the neverfull MM. I think the tote can be used anywhere. It will be good for school, work or just hanging out with your girlfriends. Sometimes the Speedy can be hard to carry, because you have to hang it on your arm. It would be nice to have a bag that you can hang on your shoulder from time to time. But it's really up to you. They are both good purchase. You can never go wrong with any of them. They are  a good investment too. I love my LV bags. They really last a long time. Good luck!!!|`|psAbFL6kaa	Bags are personal.  We all need different things out of a bag.  I have a LV speedy in pink denim.  I like the size, it's about the same as a mono speedy 30.  Very roomy, zips closed, but the drawback is that it can only be hand carried.  This bothers me sometimes, but not much.  The Neverfull is nice, shoulder carried, but doesn't zip so your items will always be exposed.  Does this matter to you?  I also don't like how the straps on the Neverfull are so thin.  I say pick whichever bag suits your lifestyle.|`|4381ce1eabe1bba2f5000ef04b6611caaa	I like the tote, its much cheaper, and it seems like you would get more usage out of it.<br>  The Speedy 30 seems more of a travel carryon bag to me.<br>  They are both great though,<br>  I would pick the tote:)|`|a9F58wUraa	speedy! you can close it all the way, nothing will fall out, its more of a LV classic!
aV0QmAOtaa	Your skin/face is a reflection of your stomach :)<br>  Eating a lot of sugar, oily food, fast food and junk food can def. make your skin irritated, oily and you can break out very easily. This is why water is often recommended so much for skin care. Water basically gets rid of toxins and cleans out your system/stomach. This is why water makes your skin look a lot better and clean. However, also keep in mind that there may be other foods that can help you break out (but this all depends on the person). For example, eating peanuts/almonds/almost any type of nut causes me to break out, while you or another person may not have that effect. This is just something you figure out as you grow up, but most of the foods you listed above are def. no-no's :)|`|ibOD8ggDaa	sugar,candy,greasy,oily fast and junk food is all bad for you<br>  and these can affect your weight and arteries in your heart too greasy,oily,fast and junk food.
2vb1zoshaa	I guess the Heart-Lock charm is the cutest. It is a noteable Tiffany piece and I guess a little unoriginal because it is so popular, but then again, isn't that why you want it? To be able to show off the fact that you have a piece of Tiffany jewelry. Sterling silver jewelry is beautiful but for some reason Tiffany Co. gets away with charging 4times the price of any other standard silver piece. If you are willing to shell out the money for a staple piece, I guess it is a good investment.|`|dtt9r8Ehaa	If you can afford only one piece I think you should get the heart lock necklace. If you can afford two You should get the Return to Tiffany round tag neclace and the T&Co. circle charm bracelet. I think they match because their charms have the same shape.<br>  <br>  No matter what you will get it will still be a good investment. I have Tiffany jewelry and they really last a long time. Even if I had them for almost a decade now, they still look good. Plus you can have them cleaned at any Tiffany store for $100 plus. Good luck on your purchase!!! Choose the heart lock necklace if you can afford only one item.|`|SfatAG9Gaa	I love the Tiffany heart lock charm! It's soo cute and I've never seen anything like it before.
BFqE10WYaa	hmmm maybe cloud from final fantasy|`|jxizzHL1aa	First off, ooh crap.  You're not going to be able to do it with that kind of hair.  Also what color gatsby did your friend give you?|`|aV0QmAOtaa	You should try some spikes or something. Lot's of gel! Go crazy! :)|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Thin it, then take a shower in the morning and gel it upward with slanty bangs hanging down in front. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://lan.ningin.com/wp-content/uploads/ningin/lan/2008/09/animehair1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lan.ningin.com/wp-content/uploads...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://a593.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/127/l_966e280d710b41cc7046670be65842e8.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://a593.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/ima...</a><br>  <br>  Actually don't use gel. Use a wax/ finishing oil mix. I use to have hair like that (except in a girl version) It helps it stand up but still makes it shiny, natural and soft. <br>  <br>  Go to a good salon and ask a hair stylist. I got my product from a aveda salon. Their very up to date and good. Theyll make you look pro. Theyll also give you the cut you need to pull that off. Theyll razor your hair and thin it out. You won't be able to achieve anything anime-like without the right cut.<br>  <br>  I'm filipino too and it looks like you have similiar texture of hair to me. I always found that blow drying it upside down in the morning gave it the body it needed to spike, then straightening the edges and putting a little bit of wax with some oil mixed on my fingertips and putting that on the tips and on the top (to help it stand up) worked great. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/29/l_7ba6189af26b40c1f215374393c9227d.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a><br>  <br>  See the back? That's what i'm talking about. It's more natural looking. That's me 2-3 years ago. Doing that technique on the whole top of your head should produce the same effect all over. Some red/black store bought dye might not hurt either. It won't be noticeable except in light. It'll have a redish sheen. It'll look more anime-like but still not unatural.
y96eYj0Faa	Don't go with double lobe piercings but single lobes are fine on guys. Um, I think a rook would be cool. I like those on guys. An industrial piercing or a tragus would look cool too. I like the industrials on guys ;]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd65/bazookatooth23/EarDiagram.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd65/...</a><br>  <br>  ^^^^Exampleeee^^^^|`|Rcs1X5Zeaa	I like the single gold hoop..like a pirate :) lol|`|85pp4KGiaa	get a barbel through the top parts of your ear, i think it is called an industrial. Those look really good. or you could just get your lobe pierced.
pqlhPnexaa	I think that would look cute. You're not a little kid, and if you have the curves show them off! The only thing I would say is to not show a ton of cleavage with the top- if you're already highlighting your waist, you don't want boobs hanging out all over the place. By making it a higher cut shirt (and make sure your pants aren't too low), you keep it looking classy.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun at your party- your outfit sounds super cute!|`|82bd5471fa6227574ee9aa967a43e4c3aa	if it feels and looks good to yourself, then sure.
DQ8WR6CXaa	As far as foundations, you have to go to the counter to get your color matched. However, MAC isn't known for their foundations. They tend to break you out a bit. BUT, everyone's skin is different. Also, the right foundation depends on the coverage you want and your skin type. <br>  1.) Do you have dry skin?<br>  2.) Do you have oily skin?<br>  3.) Do you have combo skin (oily in T-zone) <br>  4.) Normal<br>  <br>  If you have dry skin, stay away from powders & stick to liquids. As far as the prep+prime...eh.. it wasn't that great. I like Smashbox's photo finish. MACS prep+prime is a bit glittery too.. kinda weird. <br>  EYESHADOWS: <br>  As far as eyeshadows, they're awesome & super pigmented. I don't know what your skin tone is like, but must haves are: Shroom, Vanilla, Sketch, Carbon, Satin Taupe, Woodwinked... gosh I could go on forever =)  Carbon is basically a black color with no shimmer, if you want a sparkly black color get Black Tied. To prevent fallout & to make the colors last longer, use Urban Decay Primer potion (non-mac), it's AMAZING. <br>  <br>  For eyebrows, it depends on the look you're going for. Get a brow pencil if you have some gaps to fill in. If you just want to keep them groomed, get the brow set<--it's like a gel that will keep your eyebrows in place.<br>  <br>  BLUSHES:<br>  As far as the blushes, I like them too. NARS makes some awesome blushes as well. I tend to go for the powder blushes, creams can be trickier since you have to blend well. <br>  <br>  MASCARAS:<br>  As far as mascaras, they're nothing spectacular.<br>  <br>  BRUSHES:<br>  THEE greatest! A bit pricy. Must haves: <br>  EYE BRUSHES--239 (packing color to the lid) 217 (for blending in the crease) or 222 for the same purpose BUT better if you have smaller eyes/crease. 224 (perfect for blending)<br>  FACE BRUSHES- 187 (for liquid foundations/blushes...almost anything!)  and one of the angled brushes for filling in brows if you use shadow instead of pencil to fill them.<br>  <br>  Do not buy the sets, they are not hand made and the quality is not as good--they're not very soft :(<br>  <br>  Also, if you use eyeliner on the top, Blacktrack fluidline is a must!<br>  -----------------------------------<br>  <br>  I saw some other ppl telling you to go for the studio fix. Make sure to use the right product for your skin type & your desired coverage. Studio fix is more of a med-to-heavy coverage. <br>  <br>  If you do end up using liquid foundation, do not forget to SET IT. Basically, put a powder over it. I use Mineralize skin finish in natural. You can basically use any powder that matches your skin tone or an invisible setting powder (pro product).<br>  If you do not set it, it will smudge. <br>  <br>  (OH! Get Fix+... it's awesome! It will make your skin feel so good and you can use it to mix your pigments. It can also make your makeup last longer if you spray it after your done!)|`|4421hMH2aa	best makeup ever. i use the studio fix liquid foundation with the studio fix powder on top and it doesnt look heavy at all but it covers so well. for your eyes get this pot paint thats a nude color to put on your eyelid before the eye shadow. it'll stay longer and look a lot brighter. get whatever blush goes with your skin the most. or if its summer go for a bronzier one. i use a really light pink because i'm so light. good luck! <br>  :]|`|3dc824d455482baacc26222f0a74bfd4aa	definitely check out their powder foundation called studio fix. I use it and it makes my skin look flawless! I also like their powder blush. Pretty much anything by MAC is awesome. Happy shopping!|`|RcBkUBsfaa	its the best in the world...i couldnt live without mac!!!!<br>  <br>  try the powder...mac studio fix<br>  blush in powder<br>  the brushes are great!!<br>  and i totally love the eyeshadows!!!!|`|xsHT1Vz2aa	i like the eyeshadows|`|ZO4fBiOSaa	ok<br>  studio fix is great for touchups through out the day but id go w/ liquid foundation and pressed blot powder<br>  make sure you get the foundation brush # 190- its good!<br>  <br>  <br>  i deff like the blush powder better than the creme- its too gooky for me.<br>  <br>  i have used the prep+prime eye creme n it really helps the shadow to stay on long- it looks like u just put it on at the end of the day- it helps it look fresh<br>  <br>  for the eye shadow the pigment is AWESOME!!!!!! the colors pop and look so vibrant, im not a fan of the paint pot or the shade stick thou. the reg. eye shadow n the meneral ones are great too!<br>  <br>  i havent used ne brow stuff.<br>  <br>  o and last but not least- dont 4 get the brushes! they make the make-up work! o n the makup bags are cute n very durable!<br>  <br>  I love MAC!
EXdiDbTTaa	Okay so first you have to get a shimmery set of eyeshadow, I have this one that have rows of different kinds of shimmery browns and it can also can be used as bronzers, Anyways, apply your whole entire eyearea, brow to eyelashes with a rally light nuetral yellow looking color. Then after to the middlee of your eye are to the bottom apply with a darker coat, and then on your lid make it maybe like, 3 shades darker. <br>  Then for the outter area of your eyes apply a dark brown to it and also add some in your crease if wanted. <br>  Then, apply liquid eyeliner on the top, it looks like she did it thin,<br>  and apply regular eyeliner on the bottom,<br>  P.S. if you are afraid that it might get smudged, you can try freezing your eyeliner stick over the night and apply it, it doesn't smudge as much,<br>  then you have to apply a thick coat of mascara.<br>  <br>  goodluck (;|`|5I3l7q7uaa	Buy simple gold maybeline or cover girls eyeshadows, eyeliner and some light lengthening mascara.<br>  <br>  Here is the video for you;<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpqMiHidOKU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpqMiHidO...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi0RGCqGlYY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi0RGCqGl...</a>|`|SA6dCr0Laa	its easier if u see it done for yourself<br>  <br>  go to youtube and enter "urban decay deluxe pallet" <br>  there u will see those same exact colors and how to apply them.<br>  its funny cus i just did this look yesterday.. good luck!|`|F6g2iH78aa	it looks like you use liquid black eyeliner on top and bottom. and more eyeliner towards the end of the eye<br>  and then it looks like metalic gold ish eye shadow and black mascara|`|RcBkUBsfaa	put eyeliner all around the eyes...top and bottom...<br>  use mac eyeshadow in woodwinked!!<br>  then apply lots of mascara|`|ACjPwIc1aa	WELL IM NOT SURE...BUT YOUTUBE!!!

1HJwuQhAaa	its hard to tell in situations like that, especially if both people are shy to make a move. he may be thinking the same things as you! start getting a little flirty, not too strong though. hug him hello, or goodbye everytime you see him or playfully hold onto his arm when you are walking. see how he reacts, if he seems happy and is smiling and all thats very good. if he seems uncomfortable or awkward then back of a little. hope this helps!|`|cNZAO5BRaa	You need one-on-one, alone time, away from the musical and everyone associated with it, in order to tell.<br>  <br>  Ask him to go with you after rehearsal to get coffee or some food, or offer him a ride home from the rehearsal (or ask for a ride home, depending on the car situations). Then, if he still acts the same way even though you're alone, I'd guess it's definitely a relationship that's heading down the path of being more than just friends.

I would have just suggested some large velcro rollers while damp. Blow dry, and take them out, add a little hairspray. Otherwise, large curling iron, hairspray. When done, put your fingers through the curls a little and NEVER brush them. That ruins them.
RYLkjYkIaa	I think none|`|cNZAO5BRaa	All I can say is that if that gets infected, you are seriously screwed. Be careful getting it- also, I'll estimate that about 80% of girls HATE this kind of piercing.

So your average person who has a tattoo, has it because they love or are in some way involved in acting. I just love the comedy/tragedy thing.

It works wonders. They use it on chemo patients. It's a godsend. Also using it on your elbows/knees/fingertips anything else that gets dry and cracked works really well too. It's also a skin protectant for small cuts and burns. Just get a small tad bit and put a light layer over your lips with your finger before you go to bed.

VYMOwgc3aa	In my experience, air brushed foundation looks amazing. The first time I had it applied it was by my make up lady at Nordstrom. She sprayed it on & blended with a brush. It's much easier to apply & blends into your skin smoothly with great coverage. It felt like I wasn't even wearing make up at all and I loved the way it looked. It looked so smooth & natural yet covered all my facial flaws. I love the stuff :)<br>  <br>  <3|`|urCMCb1laa	Ok Quick NOTE as someone mentioned above , "airbrush Makeup" from a CAN at any department store IS NOT Airbrush Makeup!!!<br>  <br>  To get the Airbrush Makeup Feel & look You need an Airbrush System such as my Favorite DINAIR.

But does it really matter as long as there are no panty lines?!|`|9PUW480Eaa	people who actually choose 'big knickers' have usually not tried thongs.

If you don't overdo it, and put your fingers (and some palmade) through it afterwards, it should loosen up like this. I think, Take a med/large, to large sized curling iron, and curl all your hair, spraying with hairspray as you go. Not too heavy on the spray. When you're done, slide your fingers through it, and maybe add some palmade, and it should end up like this. <br>  <br>  It is likely, that she intended better curls but they didn't come out as tight as she wanted and they loosened to this. That is generally how my hair ends up when I "rush" a curl job.<br>  <br>  Play around with it and different sizes and see what you get.

It as a lot to do with how you tense up before the pic is snapped.  Just stop worrying about it and stop looking at photos.  I don't have any real suggestions to become more photogenic.

Despite the fact that I am QUITE pretty, I sometimes look ugly in pictures. In away I think you have kinda answered your question yourself (not to criticize or anything), 'sometimes I'm shocked at how ugly I look in photos, but occasionally I think I look ok.' It all depends on lighting, poses and how good your camera is. Despite the fact the mirror shows you in reverse, you are going to look somewhat like that face. Maybe not prettier- or uglier, just a little different. Trust your mirror- I know I do.<br>  <br>  :)|`|IPuL2U14aa	To be very honest I have yet to find a picture that I think I look good in. Even my senior pictures were horrible, and they were touched up by the photographer! I know I look ok in person, a lot of people say I'm pretty cute...but I am just not a photogenic person. some people aren't. But then when looking at home photos nowadays, you find a lot of people are using photoshop to touch theirs up, you can make a four hundred pound person look like a model with it! If you want to spend some money to have great pictures, by all means buy it.

Vitamin E has been shown to decrease collagen generation, fibroblast proliferation and reduce inflammation. Vitamin E can be applied topically and is easily absorbed by skin cells. It may improve the scar characteristics by its hydrating effect, thereby softening the scars.<br>  <br>  Vitamin E is not known to have any beneficial effects on acne scars and keloids. A keloid is a tumor of scar tissue that is developed, instead of maturing, and it is permanently red, hard and raised. There is also a small risk of skin allergy to vitamin E.

rvGaryaCaa	I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I think the piercer would warn you if the retainer had a chance of falling out because obviously that's a huge hazard.  You can always call and ask though just to be sure.

Otherwise it should just stay in straight and not come out at all.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you. =]

It is a ring that means "I promise I will propose to you and we will get engaged when I am old enough, rich enough, or whatever enough to get married. <br>  <br>  Secondly, I don't think you need a special ring - I think any ring will do.<br>  But if you really want to spend your money, here are some vendors:<br>  www.purityrings.com<br>  www.cornerstonejewelrydesigns.com/cata...<br>  www.waitt.org <br>  www.purityringsforless.com <br>  <br>  Thirdly, God really doesn't care if you have sex before you get married.

Therefore their is not a certain one for every little occasion.
H3PcFertaa	Here's an answer to this question from Karen Hudson:<br>  <br>  "Again, just like when you're pregnant, what goes into your body will affect what eventually goes into the baby. The general rule is no tattoos or piercings until at least 6 weeks after the baby has been weaned. This ensures that your body is back to "normal" and that the child is not dependent on your milk. Then it should be safe for you to get a tattoo or piercing."<br>  <br>  So, no.|`|Cavz3kAPaa	Any good tattoo artist would NOT tattoo a pregnant woman. There are just too many hormones, and the body is already under enough stress, so it might not handle the tattoo. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I can't think of any reason why you can't in terms of it affecting the baby, but I wouldn't do it, just because your body is still going through so many changes.|`|SW6fButzaa	It is better to wait to finish nursing.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	you can get one while you are pregnant so i'm sure you can get one while breastfeeding. just make sure to go somewhere that has sanitation as their number one priority.

It would look seriously stupid!<br>  <br>  But go ahead - it's your body, who are we to tell you what we think?  Oh, that's right, you asked us....|`|NmsBFeNJaa	If you want cavities and a strong likelihood for other teeth and gum diseases then sure, go for it. There is not a dentist in the world that would recommend it!|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	NOT A GOOD IDEA!<br>  the gums are sensitve. You should never have anything near your teeth ever.|`|AA10426129	Please do|`|YErSkMNEaa	I really don't think its such a good idea... I'm sorry :(|`|8sPS24cmaa	ewww.. i sayy no|`|aXqtzNIraa	I personally wouldn't risk my health of my teeth... choice if yours!|`|9XohPfA4aa	no. you cant keep the rings in all the time so when you eat, you will have two visible holes that will fill with food. it would definitely make backwash. and it would be uncomfortable to chew gum or close your mouth. bad idea|`|clInlnIqaa	I'm pretty certain you can not do that. And tongue piercings are dangerous enough on the mouth and teeth, so I can not imagine just how dangerous that would be.|`|ldADbhYmaa	please, some one enlighten me as to how you perform teeth piercings, why you would do it, and what its supposed to look like?|`|iaUo3tvMaa	I can't imagine the many other spots you already pierced to want to go to your teeth now.|`|loqsl5xXaa	if  you want jewelry get a grill. you can't pierce your teeth. not even a smart idea.|`|baC3UdzHaa	always pushing the limits|`|UdoLcwm4aa	This is a very bad idea.|`|igYM91eRaa	Root canal anyone?|`|59Sszxz8aa	that sounds horrible|`|PJ4kq7Nzaa	wtf can u do that. if u can i dont think ill be a great thing 2 do|`|44zx5YC9aa	wth?!|`|KJhlt5yPaa	yeah<br>  way to go<br>  have fun geting it infected<br>  ;-)|`|dFfQxy92aa	Only if you are VERY stupid|`|BMt8jcTwaa	OH man i did that wen i was 5 do it!|`|uVpNVKkWaa	thats strange.<br>  <br>  and very painful i would assume|`|tMK190xaaa	that sounds super smart|`|finFp99taa	no its a terrible idea, for all sorts of reasons but do it if you want, its not my teeth.|`|vwgmh3v6aa	doesn't sound good.|`|lvlCJDO3aa	can they really do that ? i never saw it b4|`|WmTHrVw4aa	livin on the edge. i dig it.|`|tB6f7kguaa	go for it, then maybe you could get ur hands gauged
ldADbhYmaa	Johnsons Lavender Baby Lotion smells amazing! So much better than Palmers coca butter, plus it is a great moisturizer!|`|SAtTPpABaa	***|`|74C2DOKGaa	Eww... cocoa butter smells nasty!|`|CgaQHgZLaa	Palmers coca butter|`|rGlRMe8haa	Palmer's for sure
eNulfbs7aa	sure..but it smells very "fresh" you know "baby like" I would use the Cocoa Butter...don't smell "babylike"  It might give the girls the wrong impression...|`|igrdohopaa	Don't use those. Use Lubriderm (=<br>  Not greasy and it makes your face really soft|`|1uvrkDWNaa	I like Palmer's better, only because it smells like chocolate.  Both can be too heavy to use on the face.|`|1thElV58aa	yes its ok for them to use baby lotion, girls love soft skin.<br>  <br>  baby lotion on your face is ok<br>  <br>  try St'Ives oatmeal shea butter my favorite lotion :) nice sent<br>  <br>  use cetahphli face lotion instead.<br>  <br>  dont try Vaseline coco-butter lotion...SO Oily.. my friend let me try it .|`|AA10426129	its ok to use it. Watch what you put on your face. it can make you break out|`|3NNWSpDraa	yeah thats fine,<br>  its good to see some guys actually care about thier skin<br>  =)|`|3mkRbaB0aa	Yes, it is perfectly fine for guys to use baby lotion. And as far as what has a better scent, thats up to each individual. Like me, I love the smell of baby lotion but my mom prefers the scent of cocoa butter. And as far as for something to use on your face, you probably wouldn't want to use baby lotion it could irritate your skin like it did my sister. You should probably use cocoa butter but that depends, do you have dry skin, blemishes or scarring that your trying to get rid of? If so, definitely go with the cocoa butter, but if  you have like oily skin it can still be good to soften your skin and help with blemishes and wahtnot you just have to be more careful like washing your face a bit more often to make sure you don't clog up your pores and end up creating blemishes, but all in all it's something you should try cuz it helped my skin quite a bit :)|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	I say use Aveeno for the face. Any part of the body, actually. It's THE best thing ever as far as a lotion goes. I wouldn't use baby lotion, simply because it's intended for skin that is sensitive, yes, but already VERY soft. You want something that will MAKE your skin soft. So, baby lotion might be too mild for your skin. Aveeno is your best bet. Don't get anything scented, either. Usually, you're more likely to break out if there are scents in things.|`|KCpGsN2faa	Yeah its ok to use baby lotion. I personally think for a guy if it is a choice between baby lotion and Palmer's, you should use the baby lotion cuz it is more masculine smelling than cocoa butter. I would buy a face lotion instead of using normal potion.|`|loqsl5xXaa	i like the scent of baby lotion, i wouldn't use either on face though. get a lotion or cream for the face and for your skin type.|`|Ogi1iyaPaa	Both of them are not suitable for your face, personally i think Palmer's Cocoa Butter is nicer.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	No, if you use it too much you will turn into a baby.|`|A2TRPQThaa	yes
q1LhYjv1aa	I would go with blue and pink eye shadow and black mascara.  I use always and covergirl.  You should use any make-up sparingly though don't want to clog any pores.|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	i love brown eyeliner on blue eyes, and light pinks and browns are gorgeous shadows too|`|v0Sn3V9Qaa	Go for Earthy colors, it'll look natural and really pretty. If you can put it on thin, use black liquid eyeliner, and light brown eyeshadows.<br>  <br>  But if you can't put on the eyeliner thin, use a brown pencil liner, and brown eyeshadows.|`|F8moK8ytaa	Light tans, browns, and golds along with baby pinks all look wonderful above blue eyes. <br>  Also, When going out at night wear black eyeliner and black mascara with darker smokey eyeshadows in rich browns and blacks.<br>  <br>  However during the day always wear fair light colours otherwise you wind up looking like a panda. Brown eyeliner and brown mascara.|`|KCpGsN2faa	I know a lot people look down on Wal-Mart, but they actually do have an eye makeup kit designed by professionals based on your eye color. I got the one for brown eyes and it looks awesome on me. The brand is Almay.|`|gkXEUvvxaa	i think that for ur skool social u should wear something bright n fun or if u wanna look sexy ucould go for smokey eyes n all the guys will find u totally irresistable!!|`|spXPpyP0aa	i use mono eyeshawdow. and light blue or green to bring out your eyes.
SS5py9jIaa	It means you are wicked naughty... and it is meant as a compliment... it says "sexy".|`|qWIRkiTYaa	hahaah DONT gooogle cat lady that person is rediculous unless you really look like that....but if you did i dont thknk youd be asking if it was a compliment!! lol maybe cat woman is hott lol cause cat lady is NOT. haha|`|fxFFo7e9aa	<a href="http://answersgetin.solarsciences.us" rel="nofollow">http://answersgetin.solarsciences.us</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|d3GUVXjlaa	Google "cat lady" on images and find out.|`|MWOyQAvfaa	Meow... i love cat woman! <br>  <br>  <><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AutcbHh1obSts5NcpQlUMPjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219191846AAYBgZH%3E>" rel="nofollow">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kUhcypC9aa	It depends :) x|`|spXPpyP0aa	Haha cool
7df573746dd6a85c2a8f383acdd3aefbaa	Go to a salon and ask for a shampoo that makes your hair thicker and they'll probably give you one.<br>  [:|`|spXPpyP0aa	use rogain lol|`|uclZT4Enaa	Well I have used Main n Tail shampoo and conditioner all of my life, it has helped me maintain my thick hair. <br>  <br>  After you start using it for about a month you can definately tell the difference.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps you. =]
j8HOuy8aaa	i like carmel colored highlights with brown eyes and darker hair.<br>  <br>  deep auburn looks good too.|`|eMhrDGvHaa	I wouldn't use the perfect 10 if I were you.  It fades far too fast and isn't really worth the money.  I would go for a loreal feria color.  They last longer and I've tried quite a few shades from that line that all ended up looking great!
F8moK8ytaa	Take it slow, I was exactlly the same as you at your age only half as articulate.<br>  <br>  Start off wearing your regular shirts, skirts and converse/sneakers. The tomboy-punk-ish look works well for Avril Lavigne and could work wonders for being your starting point. <br>  <br>  Your best off starting with light makeup, then slowly as you become better at application wearing more. And start styling your hair, get a nice cut with layers and spend a little time each morning making it look pretty.<br>  <br>  If you need any help with makeup, clothing, or just about anything dont be afraid to throw me an email.<br>  My MSN address is sarah_is_so@hotmail.com, For any help, dont be afraid to ask.|`|otYvv2XOaa	haha ive always been a tomboy im an athlete still in college...<br>  i struggled with this too<br>  and wound up wearing some things that were very wierd n got made fun of.. <br>  erm<br>  pride is good it will separate you from some who live to be girly and flirt.<br>  look at sanya richards world class sprinter. <br>  a tough girl, a tomboy whos also girly and highly respected  :) <br>  also <br>  FLO JO!! she inspired many gals to dress up for kicking serious ***...|`|73BIDHQ7aa	go step by step. start out with a change of clothes. instead of wearing your baggy stuff, go get some girl t shirts (graphic, v-necks) and pair it with jeans and stuff. (try: forever21, pacsun) then slowly start wearing tank tops and then shorts. <br>  <br>  for makeup: you can maybe start out with a light coat of lip gloss so its noticable but not too out there. and then you can start wearing eyeliner, and surely eyeliner are not girly at all. plus some accessories such as rings or bracelets are also a good idea.<br>  <br>  hope it helps and everything works out  !!!|`|sV5URLZHaa	I was exactly like you when I was 13 only actually 2 years ago lol but i even went so far as to wear shorts over my pants (I had some issues obviously lol) but now i love skirts, wear high heels like their sandals and love being girly! But I took it step by step too. I started with getting my hair done and just wearing jeans and t-shirts, then move into tank tops or more flowy girly tops but always stick with the jeans if you dont want it to be to noticeable a change. Um as for makeup you dont need tons of makeup to be feminine i think it looks more feminine if you go lighter. Just foundation (only if you need, dont if your skin is clear) and a clear gloss maybe some mascara. Then once your comfortable wearing the flowy tops(with jeans) then switch to shorts and tops, then once again move onto skirts. And eventually dresses will come.<br>  <br>  Now for the pride issue, take pride in the fact that your a girl and celebrate it by wearing feminine clothes!!
TYRRjIv4aa	The second one because they are classic and the animal print boots will go out of style sooner. I love the second :)|`|UnMramoWaa	The black ones, however along with the 'jellies' of the late 90's, these shoes are an embarrasment outside of the home.<br>  Glorified slippers.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	The second pair. I have them & they are gorgeous.<br>  <br>  The second pair would be harder to match to clothing & they look kinda childish.<br>  <br>  <3|`|CzK3NGZraa	the black ones.<br>  no doubt. the leopard print is...not nice.|`|QYn2hVgYaa	NONE UGGS ARE DISGUSTING|`|uDl5lUtdaa	1ST ONES!|`|mzhFrm5Taa	defnitly second ones|`|79QrhuQWaa	the second ones for sure|`|miU0ogXiaa	the black ones, but uggs are ugly in general|`|oWheKC37aa	plain black definitely|`|igrdohopaa	I really like the first one (=|`|OeQbs95Naa	im no help i hate uggs there is a reason they are called uggs and i agree they are UGLY! anyway now if you asked a ? about pumps id be happy to help =p|`|DNQxUcptaa	None!

yctdK40baa	yeah sorry i dont know, i was going to ask the exact same question. well ive bumped the question, hopefully get some answers now. i hear there great, says my mom, that i do know.
fR2Geezcaa	I just found the best store and they have a website too. It is called the Windsor Store. They had the cutest dresses for prom's and a night out on the town.|`|vkQOeDlUaa	Try Ebay..that's where I buy my formal wear.  Why spend a fortune if you are only going to wear it once!|`|KCpGsN2faa	Macy's and JC Penny's always sell nice gowns. Also, look in your phone book, u can usually find boutiques that sell unique dresses. Or go to a bridal store, most sell prom/formal dance dresses. Since u are tall and slim, you can wear damn near anything, get maybe a skintight long formal. You can find those almost anywhere formal dresses are sold. When u go dress shopping take along an honest girl friend and your boyfriend/ a good guy friend, so you can have 2 different opinons from both sexes when u try on dresses. Also, you can ask the sales people for help, contrary to what most people think, a lot of them are more than willing to help, and honestly do just wanna do that, not just make a sale, especially if you go to a younger associate, not the manager.
7KJcMpl9aa	Better question:<br>  <br>  Why do MEN wear thongs?|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	:) If only there was a way to separate ppl so that ALL the thonged girls could be in my class and NONE would be in yours!|`|AA10426129	Mostly everything girls do is uncomforable. They only like to be noticed and get attention. Of course its not comfortable. They do anything for attention|`|Xmy5PLysaa	If she is a skank she will still look like a skank no matter what the woman is wearing. I like 'em it  makes it easy to slide right in for a quickie.|`|1thElV58aa	to feel more like a Woman, or you want to tease your Boyfriend. thats it. <br>  <br>  Plus certain clothes or pants you wear you would have wear a thong.|`|Q5KFND17aa	this must be a girl on a guys account.......<br>  hell im a chick and i find it damn hot!|`|bAzI8VWfaa	to show off to guys like us rock on!!!|`|kTZevQNHaa	They're in vogue now and they don't leave panty lines...also they are more comfortable because htey don't ride up the butt cheeks...the low rise jean and low waist top leaves the top of the g string showing..that's today's fashion faux pas...personally, I'd prefer if the woman;s top was tucked in so as not to show the top of the g string/.thong.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	I love wearing them. They're the only underwear I wear.<br>  <br>  And they are very comfortable. If they fit you right then you shouldn't be able to feel them at all.<br>  <br>  And no, it doesn't look skanky in general. But if you're one of them trashy girls that wear their thong up high & their jeans down low so you can really see her undies then yeah, that's pretty damn slutty.<br>  <br>  <3|`|9i1r2VBHaa	Its uncomfy because your staring at it and growing half a stock. Dude I am not asking for you to conform, but next time do what most of us do and give God a high five in your head.|`|SPbHTgETaa	I PREFER boy shorts.  <br>  I only own ONE thong, and it still has the tag on it.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	They like the feeling of having a wedgie 24/7.|`|mN0DnlYYaa	i find them much more comfy and also i do not like panty lines from the full undies :-).|`|KKFg7pH1aa	I wear them so i dont have a knicker line|`|sV5URLZHaa	Well if a girl purposly wears a thong showing above her jeans that yes its skanky but if they aren't showing it then what is wrong with that? As for being uncomfortable they are way more confy than bikini bottoms because it (lol this will sound funny) feels like it's not even there! And the added bonus no panty lines and come on as a guy its so convenient if a girl is wearing a thong because ya put your hand down and BAM theres her butt! And as for you not wanting to see that while your taking a test you might not want to be staring at thier butt in the first place, some ppl might think it rude...|`|IPuL2U14aa	It is skanky when girls knowingly show it, if they don't it either means they need to buy bigger pants or a smaller thong. Thongs are pretty comfortable, you don't notice they are there. most girls like me wear them that way there aren't any underwear lines. you can't see while wearing jeans, but I wear dress pants everyday because of work, so regular underwear itsn't a good option in an office.|`|KCpGsN2faa	Because we want to look sexy, most men (and women) find them attractive. Most thongs are comfortable, the exception being ones with itchy glitter, feathers, crap like that. I think it's skanky only when a chick does it for attention.|`|0MPEbMYhaa	I wear them just to avoid panty lines! Girls who let that all hang out in class are skanky, but that doesn't necessarily mean all thong-wearing-girls are. And depending on the fit and style of the thong, yes, they can be uncomfortable. But they don't have to be!|`|YtLYg56Maa	Nope, it's not uncomfortable at all! in fact it's more comfortable wearing a thong then normal underwear. that may be had to believe but it's true.... even though it looks skanky. i'd rather feel comfortable<br>  -Luna|`|Ed6oxtUTaa	i think their reasons are...<br>  1. its comfortable<br>  2. It makes it so there aren't any seams showing thru their pants.<br>   <br>  As a guy, I dont think thongs are attractive.|`|se7c5zzcaa	Yep. I agree. They are so not comfortable and whoever invented them is seriously whack.|`|BVoH7WHzaa	They think it looks sexy. If it is showing above the pants, I agree, it looks very cheap.|`|WL1cX9rTaa	you queer boy? i understand its not appropriote to see at some places and on some women but thongs are great when you grow a wenier you will start to like them|`|hFGT2RCkaa	Why not wear a thong!?! They're sexy as hell! You don't enjoy them because you probably prefer men's jock straps. Good luck dude with your dudes!|`|tB6f7kguaa	umm I think it looks pretty sexy depending on what the girl looks like lol...and they wear them because we like them I guess....|`|UdoLcwm4aa	It depends on the girl. Sometimes it works, sometimes not.|`|cF3nMgpeaa	Maybe were just not slit wide enough apart yet ;-)|`|cYlcZH7Aaa	its comfrtable|`|78344ee4e6417a64e30f15b3c697c11caa	because they look sexy ! XD|`|HGl8ddWjaa	cuz they will look sexy
g29VfDGvaa	Yes. Tattoos hurt. But not like you think. <br>  <br>  Your endorphins kick in about 5 minutes in, and then you barely feel it. <br>  <br>  Its strange, its unlike any feeling. But its like a 6 on a 10 scale. <br>  <br>  It also depends on where the tattoo is located. Easy places are: shoulder blade, outer arm, side of calf. <br>  <br>  Painful places are: ribs, inner arm, chest, basically any part that doesn't see the sun. The tender spots. <br>  <br>  There is no comparing piercing and tattooing. Very very different experiences. <br>  <br>  <br>  The healing of the tattoos can often times be more painful than getting them. You will want to educate yourself on proper tattoo care. <br>  <br>  <br>  A tattoo artist that isn't worth a crap can really hurt you by going too deep, or having the machine up too high to get done fast, among other reasons. You could find yourself infected... Or worse. So do your homework. Pay the money for the best. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|IPuL2U14aa	Depends on your pain tolerance, I say it hurts worse then getting a piercing because it lasts long time, a minimum of half an hour. I have one on my hip bone, but it really wasn't that bad. there is some pain, but nothing to be scared about, I actually found it relaxing because you feel the vibration from the tattoo gun as well as the needles. Maybe take a tylenol before, but I wouldn't worry about it. I'd rather have a full body tattoo, then a light sunburn if that eases your mind. Another thing that might hurt is taking care of your tattoo right after you get it. the first few days it is very tender, like well a scab, which is what it is!|`|eQQWdk0uaa	Tattoos don't hurt too bad.  They just take awhile.  That was the worst part for me, just wanting it to be over.  It is worse than piercing because they are over before you know it, but it's not unbearable.  I don't know if extra weight makes much difference, but it's going to hurt either way, so if you want it, just do it.  Bring a friend to talk to while it's being done and it's better.|`|5TBZMx0haa	They are bearable, depends on location. Sides or joints hurt more because its so close to the bone. If you can handle piercings well, you can pretty much do a tattoo, I wouldn't really take anything before you get one. Before all my appointments, I just ate a quick lunch before coming in. My first one was a large rose the back of my right arm, above the elbow; took maybe an hour or so. I chatted with the artist a bit and had music going, that helped take my focus off some of the touchier areas. They are not horrible but there is pain involved, just try not to tense up and remember to breath!|`|QDaLE9Lbaa	I just got a tattoo on my wrist on Monday... it hurt more torwards my hand but further up the arm it wasnt so bad.. it felt like a million bee stings lol Tattoos hurt worse on the parts of your body not normally touched, like the under side of your arm or the back of your knee, but also more boney places hurt worse like your feet, ribs, wrist..ex So if your planning on getting one in a more fatty area it wont be as bad as you think. =]|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	yes, they hurt. A piercing is one poke in your skin, a tattoo is millions of pokes in your skin. But, if you think the pain is worth it, you'll get one.|`|lvlCJDO3aa	have you ever gotten a really bad sunburn then scratched it by accident well to me it kind of feels like that|`|loqsl5xXaa	yep, some parts hurt more than others. but if it's something you really like than it is worth it.|`|CqgQgSLOaa	Depends on which part of your body. They do hurt but the most hurtful place to get it done is the ankle because of the bones. So bony parts are the most hurtful places to get.|`|Aemjrtgnaa	depends on the artist and where on ur body your getting it.|`|a31kUn1Naa	I have one on my right foot.<br>  <br>  And I'd say it hurt way worse than a piercing. Totally more then 10x.<br>  <br>  But thats because the foot is all bone. So yeah.|`|OBnNGcfHaa	Yes there is some pain involved in getting a tattoo.  The amount of pain involved is different for everyone. It also depends on what area of your body your getting tattooed how big it is. Is there alot of line work or shading. Also do you have a high or low pain tolerance. I have 10 tattoos and each one the pain level was different. Most of the time I would describe the feeling as having a sun burn scratched over and over again. I will say my most pain full tattoo was the star on each of my elbows. If you do decide to get a tattoo, a good artist will keep in mind that it is your 1st tattoo and will take it slow.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	They aren't too bad. it really depends where you're getting it done. I have my whole leg covered and some on my arms and i think the worst was getting my shin, back of my ankle, knee cap and knee pit done. other than that, it isn't too bad after the first few minutes, it just kind of goes numb after a while because you know what to expect... the way i can describe it is scratching a bad sunburn with sharp nails or a piece of sand paper. What I've also noticed is that all the places I am really ticklish in, hurt the most because they are the most sensitive. so if you go with the arm or your calf or something, it will be more than tolerable.. I love getting ones that you can watch being done too. It's soo cool to watch. I love it, i can't wait for my next one.. and just a warning, they are like potato chips, you can't have just one. they are wayyy to addicting.|`|65ae5dbf750c54c86214b6a8746d4b43aa	It depends on where you get the tattoo at and your pain tolerance.  Some people say the tats on the neck hurt some say it dont. I was told the ones on the neck, ankle,  and back especially when pressed against the back bones. I have one on my left boob its a heart with a rose sitting on top of it. It hurt because theirs alot of tissue their. You shouldnt drink any alcoholic beverages before getting a tattoo because you will bleed way to much. I recommend taking maybe a loratab or hit a bong something strong lol. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|3GevtCxVaa	depends where you get it & how big it is.<br>  they hurt alot more than piercings.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://users.zoominternet.net/~rayvin/DoesItHurt.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.zoominternet.net/~rayvin/Do...</a>|`|USxxSS7qaa	I found that my piercings hurt a lot more than my tattoos. It's a diffrent kind of pain...<br>  Piercings are sharp but short while tattoos are dull but take a long time..
0KXu3KFpaa	i say you cut it....sorry|`|dGuKnWNgaa	Brush it, put in some gel|`|KCpGsN2faa	Don't cut it, long hair is super sexy on most men and women in my opinion. Straighten it and if u can put it in a ponytail.

a370d8c7d4357a7a7a5a4efe2e727266aa	Get your breast enhancement surgery in India.Cosmetic Surgery (including facelift/ breast enhancement tummy tuck./lipo) is very cheap in India.There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges cosmetic surgery for foreigners in India.They are called the Forerunners Healthcare.I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories.I have also read that they arrange financing for international patients as cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance or by the stinking NHS.<br>  <br>  They also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star .<br>  <br>  My cousin got her cosmetic surgery done there and she is more than very happy with the results.sHe is all praise for this forerunners healthcare company.She paid just 30% of the cost what she was quoted in USA and it was like a wonderful vacation for her. .hope this helps.I think she paid only 8000$ for the tummy tuck and liposuction surgery for which she was quoted 22000 $ in USA.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AjPGJtko_mul.zHFDoI4miYjzKIX?qid=20060619131938AAb5Sfi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=...</a>|`|7ce5dd48cabadf551140ebafe1f373d3aa	Nope. :)<br>  <br>  ~ Elle|`|2143c956ebc7f7278b79f51077f1f10eaa	first of all i would never get breast implants .

XOlnc8iBaa	Use brown eyeliner or eyeshadow. Dont worry they will grow back in a week or 2.|`|e9JRcA35aa	An eyebrow pencil will cover them, yes. Before you do that though, your best bet would be to buy some root touch up or another small box of hair dye and just dye them. It will save you a lot of time and effort.|`|PGMeHgwmaa	No worries. Just dye them the same color as your hair but make sure you leave it on for a small amount of time like ten minutes because that hair turns color easier than head hair|`|miU0ogXiaa	maybe you can dye them|`|spXPpyP0aa	draw them in with eyebrow pincle|`|JHLK8T92aa	i'd say dye them darker or use mascara it works better than eyeliner and eyeshadow. even blank works just do it lightly but a lighter color is better. just use it like a brush. if that doesnt work for you than eyeshadow is the second best just make sure its not like liquid haha. <br>  im really sorry btw that sounds like it sucks. <br>  i wish you good luck.<br>  hope i helped:)|`|qGiFTnC2aa	Any beauty salon can dye them darker for you - I wouldn't try DIY.  You could shade them with eye shadow, but I think the dye is a better idea.|`|IPuL2U14aa	My guess would be either an eyebrow pencil or some eyeshadow. I once used a brown eyeliner pencil when I tried Nair on mine and took half of one off.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Haha, use eyeliner and kind of just go over it.  Not black eyeliner, that'd look ridiculous if you have blondeish or brown hair.<br>  Buy one that matches your eyebrows and kind of just go over it.<br>  Go over both eyebrows though so it's not obvious.<br>  I've seen people do it and it looks really good.
KCpGsN2faa	The french twist is a classic. For my senior prom I put half my hair up and left the rest down in curls, with some strands framing my face. It really depends on what kind of dress u have for the hair/makeup.|`|spXPpyP0aa	put it up and have|`|xsHT1Vz2aa	a braid?

vTfEYeKQaa	For me, giving birth was a lot worse. I have 5 tattoos, one being on my upper back...it really wasn't that painful. It's more annoying than painful.  It's like a cat scratching you over and over...but once it's done, it feels like a sunburn for a few hours...then it's just tender to the touch. I think if you can give birth, a tattoo should be a breeze!|`|e0b72c5a543a2ac83d3bd8c89c44146aaa	wife says giving birth|`|Cavz3kAPaa	"If you can push a watermelon through your vagina you can do a small tattoo." DUDE, She had a C-SECTION! Assuming she hasn't had any other children, how on earth would she be able to compare it with pushing a watermelon out?!<br>  <br>  Tattoos seriously don't hurt. I think of it like a cat scratching you, but the pain stops as soon as they take the machine off you. So it's basically a temporary stinging feeling.<br>  <br>  I've never had a child, but I imagine it to hurt much much more than a tattoo (and I've had one on my foot & on my thigh)|`|fznvQptlaa	having a baby is worse. obviosly theres pain with a tat as well.. love ur idea. its actually a good pain believe it or not. i got my daughter's name (grace) tattooed in script on my wrist and in tiny letters below it it says john 1:16 (johnathan is my sons name).|`|USxxSS7qaa	Getting a tattoo is A LOT less painful then birth...<br>  If you can push a watermelon through your vagina you can do a small tattoo...|`|miU0ogXiaa	tattoos don't hurt that much.  people exaggerate the pain|`|eQQWdk0uaa	Getting a tattoo is not even comparable to giving birth. I have 3 tattoos and have given birth twice.  Getting a tattoo is like someone scratching on your skin and just breaking the surface.  It's more annoying than actually painful.  There were moments when I just wanted to tell them to stop, but it's just because I needed a break for a minute.  Get the tattoo if you want it, they are not that bad.
79QrhuQWaa	i accidently got a hair removal cream on my legs after i'd shaved them and it hurt a lot. there was sort of a red burnt patch too. so i probably wouldn't.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes u can|`|AA10426129	Yes you can use nair<br>  It will look better than if you shaved.|`|ptZdKKiBaa	You can use nair. and yes you can put nair on the shaven area. just make sure to test it on a small part of your leg first. some people have bad reactions to the nair.|`|cjwu3YaEaa	I personally think Nair works better then shaving. It leaves your legs smoother and you don't need to shave for a while longer. You can put Nair on an already shaven area, so go ahead! (:|`|uIAHkm0Naa	yeah nair will work..why would you put nair on an area youve already shaved?|`|IPuL2U14aa	you sure can! but be very careful, that stuff can burn your skin! I tried it on my eyebrows when I was younger, and It burned the skin off.
FS8n1FUQaa	MAC would be best.  If you call ahead and let them know several of you are coming, that would be a good idea.  It doesn't cost anything, but each person is expected to buy at least one of the products used on them.|`|spXPpyP0aa	mac is hella money|`|s4KZRtF8aa	yes.
RYLkjYkIaa	why shouldnt they wear some????<br>  <br>  never heard a rule for that|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|XHweMNNkaa	Men should be able to wear and dress however they want. Gender roles are yet another man-made idiocy.|`|MgiK02Zbaa	not unless its a septum piercing.|`|cWuumdy7aa	no man should wear nose rings. its feminine|`|kUhcypC9aa	No :) x|`|spXPpyP0aa	no|`|f5NXsiayaa	It depends how the guy is. If he's a prep, HELL no he shouldn't have his nose pierce, b/c it doesn't go-with-the-flow. If the guy is goth, or scene he can get his nose pierce because it suits them better!|`|xsHT1Vz2aa	no.....|`|r7rfflpyaa	Wearing nose ring or ear ring depends on the choice of an individual.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	Why not.<br>  The way I understand it, nose rings and multiple piercings make it easier to find that high paying job.|`|Sb93dIXbaa	Only if you want to look ridiculous!|`|H6rPxpHWaa	Hell Yes! My bf has one and he looks so hot!|`|mzrNTI8naa	yeah.<br>  <br>  men suit rings better then studs<br>  <br>  xx|`|miU0ogXiaa	eeww no|`|qWIRkiTYaa	some men...others no. haha septum? really depends. it fits some well some not.|`|GG2bxCd1aa	No. It doesn't make them look decent unless you wanna look otherwise.|`|jACbPO7xaa	only if you have the look for a hoop.. other wise you just look like tupac|`|s6pLuijLaa	if your a ******.
miU0ogXiaa	because you aren't your friend|`|74C2DOKGaa	Different types of hair! Try a flat iron!|`|QQJi2Jvuaa	I don't know, i can barely understand with the Ebonics in the question, i get it though. <br>  <br>  everyone has different textures and courses of hair type. maybe your friend had straight and medium hair type and your is much course so when its wet to blow dry it gos frizzy.<br>   <br>  my hair is course so i use a dryer after i wash. then, i use a hair Straightener the Ceramic Maxi Glide with steam burst and it works good not everyone can blow dry there hair and have it come out shiny and smooth you gotta do extra sometimes.|`|Si9hhcW1aa	Could just be the type of hair you have. Each person has different hair and each person's hair reacts differently. Just try out different sleeking products and decide on the one that works best for your hair.|`|cnMT4pzuaa	maybe you two have different hair types, or use different hair products.

It would make him even more attractive to me.|`|lvlCJDO3aa	lol i live in hawaii so to see people barefoot is pretty normal if they are barefooted they usually have no shirt on and i think its perfectly fine..|`|2Qpor8Xgaa	first, i think he looks hot, then i see he's barefoot. in a grocery store.

I just happen to enjoy walking barefoot as much as humanly possible)|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Why would he not have shoes on? lol<br>  <br>  What happened to the "No shirt No shoes No Service" sign? <br>  <br>  thats kinda weird...<br>  <br>  but if i saw a hot GIRL in a grocery store barefoot, it wouldnt change my view of what i think about her......<br>  <br>  but thats because girls usually have nice feet, guys feet can be terriblely ugly LOL|`|YErSkMNEaa	If he was hot then I noticed that he was barefoot in a store... that would kill the attraction for me Lol|`|C0TL8d2Gaa	I'd get so turned on.

AA12100644	You really don't want to buy a shampoo that says it will give the volume.  All it will do is open up your hair follicle and actually create damage.  If your hair is colored, a great shampoo is L'Oreal for color treated hair.  Use it every day - it is like silk.  It has a matching conditioner that's great too.  If you want volume to your hair - get it cut about shoulder length and have them add layers to your face - or get highlights.|`|94e089f3169741dd5cb21db2b511fd05aa	try awapuhi shampoo by paul mitchell. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/hair-care/paul-mitchell-awapuhi-shampoo/361635" rel="nofollow">http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/hair-care/paul-m...</a>|`|1f7ae02e3911f8c9759e194ee367621caa	look at one of those tv commercials.with the real catchy songs.lol|`|7c8bdcfc06f1cf42f40d5190371dcb1eaa	pantene|`|c46db6f03e1a99b94e6a53d48b612dc8aa	Before buying, you might want to ask your hair dresser.

The American Girl Samantha movie is set in the Edwardian era, which was right after Victoria died (really not what you want, but hey, it's what I can think of.)

The movie couldn't really be called "dark", but more deep and emotionally powerful. There is also the movie adaption 'Pride & Prejudice', based upon another book of Jane Austen, though it may be a bit too cheerful to even nearly fit your two requests. Thus, the first will be the most fitting, the latter less. <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped you and good luck in finding the right movie(s)!

c640479951c339f834f0f5ac6f920cb3aa	Benzoyl peroxide is sooo harsh on the skin.  What I used to do when I used it, I put on a facial mosturizer about an hour or 2 before I cleansed.  That way the moisture gets soaked into your face.  Then when you clean, obviously the b.p. cleans it out, so just make sure that you use the facial cream after too.  Check out the Noxema site because they have a great line of things for your face.  Good luck!|`|ee15e8ea4128f044db013332fb021854aa	well, if ur using it for acne, and  if u are using the benzoyl peroxide in a gel or lotion, try applying it only directly to the pimples. if you are  using it in the form of a cleanser, and it is drying out your skin, try not to use it as often. also be sure to moisturize. another way to help keep skin from being dry and flaky is using an exfoliating treatment, then using a good moisturizer with vitamin e and aloe. also drink lots of water.|`|3b095b6efad8a3e2a0545db397727e70aa	If it's spot treatment (for individual pimples), make sure you only apply it to the zit & not the surrounding skin.<br>  <br>  Dryness is common & hard to avoid if it's an all-over treatment you're using (like face wash or oxypads).  Using moisturizer is an option, but that might just make your skin go crazier.  You might be better off with products that contain salicylic acid instead of benzoyl peroxide - they basically do the same, but salicylic acid is less drying for some people.

YQ87jVdjaa	The solid stick can't be used to moisturize your whole body like the lotion because it's too thick, it's too greasy, and you'd probably use the whole thing while trying. The solid kind is basically used for scars or elbows, lips, etc. I don't know what brand you're using but I've used both Palmers cocoa butter lotion, as well as Vaseline's cocoa butter lotion and they both work great. So if you want to moisturize a small part get the solid version, if you're looking to moisturize the whole body get the lotion. Better yet get both. It's really good for the skin.|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	The Cocoa Butter solid is cocoa butter, period.  Lotions usually just have some cocoa butter added to it.  If what you found is what I'm used to using it's in a stick form that you expose by puch up on the bottom.  This is usually used to apply to scars, stretch marks, burn or anything else you'd like to fade over time.  Hope this is helpful.|`|b1175d4d889f29087cceea9d76b4eccfaa	no sorry idk.|`|2VXJnNUYaa	Its the pure oil from a cocoanut. It turns to a solid unless its warmed. It melts easily in your hands or at room temp in summertime. Its a heavy duty moisturizer for the body after swimming. Use on legs, arms but never on your face. Its too heavy and will clog your pores. I used to use it to tan; back before sunscreens came out.|`|E8xD5ikjaa	Lotions are thinner formulas of the item...stick is awesome for elbows :D lotions for normal to oily skin, cream for normal to dry skin, and solid for joints or really really badly dried skin

Everyone's skin is different.|`|K5F5mhzmaa	Maybelline Pure is what you want. It's a liquid foundation that's made with 50% water--completely oil-free, so it won't clog up pores and break out your skin.  This foundation looks completely flawless and never cakes. Because it's 50% water, it doesn't dry out skin. It never looks too obvious, because it has sheer-to-medium coverage.<br>  <br>  For reference, I have combination skin-- oily nose and forehead, but dry cheeks, and redness above my jawline. <br>  <br>  These foundations are ranged somewhere between $4-$10 bucks and are readily available at your nearby drugstore/target/walmart! <br>  <br>   I have a fair, warm complexion with yellow undertones. I use Light 02 and it's a perfect match for me! If you're cool-toned, I suggest odd numbers like Light 01 or 03. <br>  <br>  If you tend to look orange, that means either 1) the foundation color sucks, or 2) you picked a shade that was too dark for you, or 3) you're cool-toned and picked a warm shade. To check if you're cool-toned or warm-toned, check out the color of your veins on the inside of your wrists. If they're more blue than green, you're cool-toned. If they're more green than blue, you're warm-toned.<br>  <br>  I got my Maybelline Pure liquid foundation for $3.99 on sale! It's a blue tube with a gray screw-on cap.<br>  <br>  Many low-end brands are just as good as, and even better than, high-end brands, in my opinion.|`|gpN0JfCzaa	Do you need to use a liquid foundation? <br>  Unless you have some kind of crazy allergy, what makes people break out from make-up is the oil in liquid foundation and the talc in the powder foundations. <br>  It's very easy now to find powder foundations (pressed powder, not liquid to powder!) that are talc free. I like physicians formula and you can get it right from CVS for like $15.00<br>  Also, make sure you use a really great face cleanser before bed. It's very important that you wash off not only your make up but the dirt and oil that's accumulated on your face during the day. Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask is awesome.<br>   And be sure to use a light moisturizer in the morning. If your skin gets too dry it'll flake and actually cause clogged pores, but if you use too heavy of a moisturizer you'll get too oily and clog pores that way. <br>  <br>  If none of this seems to be your problem, I'd think about going to see a dermatologest to see if you have a skin allergy. At least from there you can get a grip on what's going on with your face and he/she will be able to suggest make ups or creams for you. <br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|lhalT7Qfaa	try avon... they guarantee their product or your money back!|`|02797a7699a7653821ce2dbd3ba78a2eaa	brands arent  necessary. what you need to look for are ingredients. water based foundation are least likely to cause break outs.|`|XQAfUJxMaa	Try Clinique. <br>  <br>  I have acne, and though it does nothing to help me, it doesn't create more of a problem.

230cffdfc69a49f6816925d200011de4aa	whoa..major damage girlie! well u should use hot oil treatments once a week..they help with the heat damage. Sunsilk, i have to say, works awesome! You should try the TLC (pink line) it leaves your hair feeln soft and smelling mmm good. (and the TLC hair mask works grrreat!) You can also try the anti-breakage line from them (its like a purple color) it should help somewhat with your split-ends. Also remember to get your hair trimmed at least every 6-8 weeks.|`|cWBsLpjwaa	I never tried sunsilk but I used Pantene restoratives Breakage Defense Shampoo.

l2gqxJ9Taa	Sounds like you're concerned with the health of your hair. If so, the girls today have beautiful, thick and curly hair. You just need to go au naturelle. Virgin hair is stronger than processed hair and pressing it is to me creates more stress on the hair shaft than perming it because people tend to press the hair more frequently. <br>  <br>  Keep hair free of split ends by clipping the ends of your hair monthly. If you can't afford to wash your hair every weekend then plan to deep condition hair and use hot oil treatment every other week or once a month.|`|44h8skM6aa	when you get split ends, you simply have to trim your hair.|`|ODsotNeVaa	why do u want to straight ur hair any way?! do u have curls? i like curl even though i have straight hair...maybe they have split ends too.....or it's their natural hair!!!!|`|aDM7mpg2aa	Well first off you need to make sure that your straightner is not to hot. Take a tissue and clap it between the straightner if it turns the tissue yellow it too hot. Second you need to get products that aid in straghtening and heat protection *for straightening I suggest Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum and for heat protection just use any kind of heat protection spray* and lastly you won't get split end from your roots to the ends.|`|ajfmBtKRaa	Do you use your straightener on a high setting? If so, maybe you should try it on a lower temperature. If that's not the case, there are some hair care products that you can spray into your hair that supposedly guard from split ends, frizz and other mishaps that flat irons may do to your hair. Perhaps if you tried some of those, your hair would cooperate. :)

Simply Silver or So Silver are shampoos that are dark purple that counteract the brassiness in blonde hair. You can get this at your beauty supply (Sally's carries a brand of this). If ever in doubt, any good cosmetologist will give you some good at home advice...<br>  Good luck! :)|`|IvoaNyN2aa	my guess is that if it is brassy you should choose a different shade ..maybe one that is more ash?

8TgOg6aIaa	They are several things that you can do to make your hair more moisturized and manageable without going to the hair salon. Moisture is extremely critical for your hair as you have several inches of new growth. <br>  <br>  Tip #1:  Alternate braiding your hair and leaving it loose. Braiding can be good, but it can also put undue stress on your hair.<br>  <br>  Tip # 2: Do conditioning pre-wash treatments to your hair before shampooing it. Simply whip up 2 tablespoons of Mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and a 1 egg. Let it remain on your hair for at least an hour. It will tame and soften your new growth. Do this 2-3 times a week.<br>  <br>  Tip # 3: Buy a high quality, all natural hydrating product for your hair. I have tried several hair care products for African American hair, including Carol's Daughter, Giovanni, Ojon, KeraCare, and Motions. However, I recommend using GodHead Silky Smooth Hydrating Shampoo & Conditioner. It will hydrate your hair and infuse your scalp with essential oils made to grow and treat dry, coarse, and damaged hair. The product also contains moisturizing Aloe Vera, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E, and Jojoba, which will heal and moisturize your strands and make your hair more bouncy, shiny, and healthy.  The product will also soften and detangle your hair better than most, if not all, products on the African American hair care market. As a result, your new growth will be more manageable and will flatten. Of course, it will not straighten your new growth like a relaxer, but, the more you use it, your new growth will loosen into a wavier pattern. Go to www.discoverb4a.com to find the products.<br>  <br>  If you go with another brand of products, make you stray away from traditional, unnatural hair care products available for purchase in most drugstores or beauty supply stores. They contain synthetic emulsifiers and harsh detergents, such as Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Phosphates, Dimethicone, and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Unfortunately, these products are loaded with toxins and chemicals and will strip your hair of moisture and nutrients it needs to be soft, healthy, and hydrated.|`|mbPxyPApaa	u should try garnier or how eva u spell that|`|VNpLftzVaa	panteen pro v
976ebea085177eab173b82330c81ec61aa	proactiv works, honestly it really does, but it takes a few weeks (more than the two they say on the commercials). it does share ingrdients w/ OTC products and they are benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. get a high percentage in your OTC products. personally, i get university medical (the knock off of proactiv in the orange box) as a daily cleanser and it works just as well for half the price. and for deep cleansing (every girl should do this, even if u dont have skin issues) i use neutrogena clear pore cleanser/mask every other day. it smells like ralph lauren perfume and really aids the daily cleanser.|`|K5SGG1QYaa	THIS IS REALLY GOOD ADVICE!<br>  <br>  look, there is no magic cream. think about it, spots are caused by clogged pores witch allow bactria to grow deep in the pore, under the 'plug'. there is no way a cream, wash or mask, could go that far into clear pores, let alone pores with which are blocked!<br>  <br>  i tried EVERY cream and wash out there and spent a bloody fortune along the way. i finallly came to the above conclusion, and i decided to try and tacklr it from the inside.<br>  <br>  no, i'm not going to tell you to drink more water, eat more fruit, sleep more, or get more exercise. its very good for you, and it may even improve your complexion, but its been proven time and time again it does nothing about acne.<br>  <br>  i went to my doctor and he put me on the pill. for the first 2 months it did ***** all about my acne, nothing, NO CHANGE! then i came out in bloody giant boil/cyst things. DONT GO ON THE PILL! different contreceptive pills alter different hormones to make you infertile, and your doctor just prescribes 'the pill', what you get depends on what your chemist stocks. others may work, but i dont know which, and i wouldnt take the risk!<br>  <br>  then i went an oral antibiotic, it took a few months but ITS WORKING! go and get some NOW! i'm on mynocycline, so i recomend that, but i'm sure theyre all the same. they kill all the bacteria deep in your skin where the creams cant reach, where they actuly cause spots, so if your pores block, you dont get spots. (it also worked 4 a fu of my friends). i recomend using gentle skincare designed to clear your pores and control oilyness, this will be the same as acne skincare only more gentle and not antibacterial (you sont need that, obviously, and the chemicals are really hard on your skin) the brand isnt that important because theyre all the same, but someething of a good quality, biore and clinique are good. i use clinique because i have sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  also, whn you get a spot, leave it as much as possible (unless its really pusy, in which case squeeze it hygenically right at the begining so u dont hav the urg 2 always poke about with it) and just dab a bit of antiseptic like TCP on it 3 or 4 times a day. DONT USE SCRUBS! they 'anger' acne, and spread all the bacteria from open spots (with heads) around. when the spot isnt infected anymore, and you just have a mark (or woundish think if you squeezed it) put a healing cream on like nelsons healing cream, it helps it fade quicker.|`|dfpE7LtPaa	I LOVE PROACTIV .

I recognize that you're in that stage where you've decided you want a tattoo and sorta kinda have a sense of what you might like but don't have anything definite in mind.  Now is the time to sit back and really do some hard thinking. Good tattoo ideas spring from  what is important, funny or meaningful to the person getting the tattoo.   So start there. I like the Italian language concept by the way.  The previous posters are absolutley right..."Does it hurt?"  "What should it say?"  "Where should I put it?" are all questions that will seem ridiculous to you soon enough.  The reality is that the choices are infinite...be an individual and create something unique for yourself from within yourself.

8c7cc680a9dfdc46cf7a06e1622558bbaa	Keep getting regular trims and be careful when brushing or using heat styling products. Also never brush your hair when it is wet!! only use a comb.<br>  <br>  Oh and Patience is they key!|`|3d282ced673963b513a58ff9b2caec24aa	The best way, let it grow out and don't cause too much damage to it, don't dye it too often, don't use too much heat. If your hair starts breaking, you'll get that v-shape at the back and you'll have to cut if off to look decent. Use a strengthening conditioner and do a hair mask once a week.|`|7b70f1a5854be1b09386c77760fd2b07aa	Wash it only 3 times a week, try not to blow dry it to often, and use good shampoo and conditioners.

I have heard that zinc, silica, selenium, iron and lecithin are good for hair growth. Some people also mix a tablespoon of mustard oil with two tablespoons of coconut or almond oil, and rub it into the scalp, as a pre-wash hair conditioner. Scalp massages are also good for stimulating hair growth.|`|f9eaed45e0e60eee10f1a785d319688caa	cut the ends every 2-3 weeks!!!
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Actually corn starch works even better than baby powder - corn starch is actually an ingredient in many powders and does work.  Back in the late 70s there was a product called "Psssst" - and that was just the powder in a can.  So here's how it works - the easiest way is to have a soft bristle brush and lightly shake some of the powder onto the brush -then brush through your hair starting nearest the scalp - brush through thoroughly.  If you do it at night be sure to brush your hair good in the morning with a different brush.  If you do it in the morning just make sure to brush with a different brush after powdering. Oh, and what it does is absorb the oils in your hair.   Make sure you don't use a lot of powder or corn starch or you'll look like a grandma.|`|5de839df03a8242ec8e1e66025a26026aa	I have found that translucent powder is better for this.  A little more subtle.|`|7FyOsJxNaa	I have heard good things about the baby powder, but I've never had to try it.  My hair got used to not being washed every day and wasn't so greasy anymore.<br>  <br>  Now my hair is in better condition when I stick to washing it every two or three days.  I use a terry cloth shower cap from the dollar store, they're awesome.|`|fohh0ajAaa	What would be the point of translucent powder?!<br>  The reason you're using the baby powder is to absorb the oil.<br>  And it's not like you  dump a huge pile onto your head...<br>  Put it in your hands and rub them together over the sink then rub your hands on your roots and along the hairline of your face until the whiteness is gone and the grease. I will then either style my hair with product (like hairspray) or use a body spray/perfume to get rid of the baby powder smell! Good Luck! Also if you ask your hairstylist they can recommened you products to freshen your hair, I know Meijer's sells them just can't remember the names of the products!
a4cf1b0a9f8be96da2b38908ddbed266aa	Try loreal has a hair color remover. It takes the black out but it leave your hair like orange tint so you'll have to dye it after using it.

982279d1c02d4cd1cf6cc91caef5ab0daa	Muted darker colors, or very bright deep colors, instead of pastels. Try an off-the-shoulder look- its very flattering if you have chubby upper arms, and its a timeless look. It works especially well if you have a nice shoulder line. What color depends on your skin tone. If you have pinky undertones, try a deep blue or green- avoid orange or  If you have an orangy tone, try a burgandy or orange (avoid pink or white like the plague). Black is always a classic choice, but be sure to add some color with your jewelry so it dosen't look like your going to a funeral. Bright colors are very flattering with dark skin, while they makes us paler girls look sick! Try a vivid blue or red- they make a great statement without being overdone. (and if i remember my proms, you'll stand out in a sea of baby pink and blue poof)  For your figure, go for something with an off-the-shoulder look, and make sure it isn't too tight on you. Forget the tag- if it fits, it fits! Try something with a fuller skirt and a drop waist ( waists that make a V shape). Boning will help too, but its less then comfortable. (boning is plastic rods sew into the dress) Those will add to an hourglass shape. Avoid narrow skirts and skirts that are fuller at the bottom- those will make you look shapeless or bulgy in the middle. Just go with what looks good on you! Accent your assets instead of worring about being chubby- if you've got nice breasts, show them off! If you've got beautiful hips, a drop waist will accentuate those. You can get controlling underwear if you're worried about belly chubbiness (those things are the invention of the devil, but the affect is worth it! take it from another chubby girl) If you've got nice shoulders, show those off, ect. Don't worry about your weight- just stick to showing off what looks good!<br>  <br>  If you want to make a statement, try making a trip to a vintage store, or even goodwill or the salvation army. Look on ebay and online, too. Vintage dresses are less expensive, and you can usually find exactly what you want if you look hard enough. Plus, you won't have to worry about showing up in the same dress as half the girls in your class!|`|b6ed75cef904599c8deeb4ac46157d96aa	i think since it is in feb. u should wear pink,red,purple,or something that suits u.and nobody should call their self fat even if they are!!!|`|4e82e862976e1f1b7c6dacdcc2dbc4d7aa	i think that you should go with a dress that has a striking color.. or you can go with gothic style

z4TfGrBDaa	DONT perm it|`|7euKjvG9aa	Condition it with an ultra moisturizing deep conditioner, then white its still wet use a hair cream in it to soften it, braid it into one braid, let it dry, take it down, rub on an oil,  use a wide toothed comb to only hold the ends, do not comb it at all, blow dry while the hair is stretched, until the hair starts to loosen wave a bit, let it cool while it is still stretched out. Shake it out rub on more oil to make it really shiny, and then put it into a ponytail.|`|9a9efa502b0058af7e0569bc2672d617aa	ONE can NEVER have to much moisturizer. I recommend that after washing your hair, use a leave in conditioner and then apply some extra virgin olive oil. Braid it tightly large to medium braids and leave it that way for about three days. Unravel it carefully and then you should have waves. Much like a crimp affect but that would be the natural way to go instead of applying heat; which is NOT good for African American hair.<br>  <br>  DO NOT BRUSH OR COMB after you unravel it! You can use your fingers part it into a micro wave but whatever you don't brush or comb it.|`|IvoaNyN2aa	one good way would be to put some product on it like mousse or gel and sleep with it in a braid

Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin. It will not remove your dark circles on the first application (but you will notice a difference), but if you do it daily for a week, and then 2-3 times a week for maintenance, you should notice a drastic reduction in dark circles.<br>  <a href="http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01/01/special-spa-home-remedy-to-reduce-dark-circles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01...</a>|`|5j260HSTaa	I wouldn't recomend using the fake tanner because there is a chance that the dark circles under your eyes will become even darker than the rest of your face after you use the fake tanning make-up.|`|9f501fa25deb38509be74d598afc9cfeaa	I wouldn't try it.

E67wp1XLaa	there really isn't any other way to make your hair straight besides straightening it with a flat iron OR getting it permenently straightened (which can be costly, ineffective, and damaging). <br>  <br>  a flat iron can be a great tool if its used correctly. the problem is, you can buy a flat iron anywhere, but nobody tells you HOW to use it to keep your hair healthy. well, thats what i'm going to do.<br>  <br>  first of all, you need a ceramic iron. most of them are these days, but you can't cheap it out. the cheap ones are usually just ceramic coated, which means its not REALLY ceramic. you need one thats fully 100% ceramic or else it'll fry your hair. a good flat iron will cost you at LEAST $50, but it should last your forever. I love the Paul Mitchell smoothing iron. It's about $120, but it works really well, adds a ton of shine, and will last you years...literally. i'm a professional hairstylist, and i've had my Paul Mitchell iron for 1 year and a half now, and I use it WAY more than you ever could. Chi is another good one, but expensive.<br>  <br>  another very important step is PRODUCT.  people fail to use good products, or any for that matter, because they feel they don't work, or for some other reason, but even if the product doesn't work, it WILL protect your hair. a leave-in conditioner like Paul Mitchell The Cream works great, and if you're trying to get a shiny, sleek finish, Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum works wonders! Use it when its wet AND dry, and it will protect your hair. the iron will burn off product before it burns your hair.<br>  <br>  lastly, you shouldn't be heat styling your hair on a daily basis. washing your hair too much will dry it out, so try to go at least every other day. a flat-iron finish should last at least 2 days, if not more than that. obviously, if your hair starts to look greasy, or starts to smell bad, you should wash it. but on average, you can go 2 days before this starts happening.<br>  <br>  you should also use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. make sure you don't put the conditioner directly on your scalp or it'll weigh it down or look greasy. always start on the ends, and work your way up. the ends are what need the moisture most.<br>  <br>  good luck! i hope this helps.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	have a stylist apply a relaxer.....CHI is the best|`|27462b4710556aa4b206551af4ada52caa	put a relaxer on it|`|7KSug1BUaa	why dont you want to use a straightener? same thing happens to me when i blow dry it so i just let it air dry over night then in the morning straighten it.|`|e34a14804acde4a753afa362ead0c478aa	Find a salon that offers the Brazilian straightening method. My best friend had Shirley Temple curls and now its stick straight, has no frizz and we live in Miami!! (humid) <br>  <br>  The brazilian straightening is cheaper then the japanese version plus after the first time you only have to touch up your roots. So you could wait up to 6 months if you didnt have the time or money.  Its also super healthy. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|suNqR4hNaa	well, u  can go to a salon, and then have your hair straightened. then, after u do that, use straightening shampoo to keep you hair straight. good luck!!!!!|`|lXtkFkpeaa	use a hair serum. it wil calm ur hair down
Yb8U8D7Saa	you can get a chemical relaxer which doesn't straighten completely but if your hair is crazy curly it does help, or things like the chi straightening system. it's really expensive but totally worth it. your hair is left in amazing condition and really straight. i don't recommend you do it yourself because these chemicals are so strong there is a good possibility of breaking a lot of your hair off. i hope this helps|`|AA12111931	what i did was put baby oil on my hair then straighten it|`|a9nYJXFRaa	i would buy a straightener.......you can buy one just about anywhere....but the best kind is a chi. if you get it chemically straightened then as your hair grows it will be wavy at the root. I use a chi and it works well. but make sure and use some kind of protection. like biosilk oil.|`|aLmEid46aa	Well, depends on your age. If your younger, you probably shouldn't get it done.. But to get it nice and strait--<br>  <br>  1.After a shower, blow-dry your hair.<br>  2. Spray it down with a water bottle (Ones they use in salons to wet hair) after blow-drying.<br>  3.Blow-dry again<br>  4.Straiten hair<br>  <br>  If your hair is frizzy, consider using John Frieda Frizz Ease before the first blow-dry.|`|AA11987767	i've tried every product and iron i could find for years and gave up. then a friend came over and loaned me her iron. I could not believe what it did for me. I went the next day and bought me one and can not live without it now. Its called the CHI flat iron. It is rather pricey but is well worth the money because it works! If you'd like to try one before buying it, go to a salon and ask , most have an iron and can do it for you. I promise, I was a beautician in my younger days, this iron works. its amazing. good luck.|`|3236f5358eeeaca5a9260bfc660166abaa	Chemical relaxer, or just regular hair straighteners.

2NRCJgq2aa	It's the oil and the egg yolk.  Mayonnaise is no longer made with egg yolks if store-bought.  Mayonnaise is nothing more than an emulsion of egg yolks and oil, with a little lemon/lime juice or vinegar and salt/pepper/powdered mustard (spice to taste).  Basic salad dressing stuff, nothing exotic.<br>  <br>  If you want to use egg yolks on your hair, there are loads of recipes on the net for shampoos that incorporate them.  <br>  <a href="http://beauty.about.com/cs/haircarerecipes/a/raw_eggs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.about.com/cs/haircarerecip...</a><br>  <br>  Beer is supposed to be good, too.. but the smell, ugh.|`|AA11006063	Protein (from eggs)  and oils (fats)  in the mayo contribute to shine and healthy looking hair.|`|1tauLH2Jaa	I've never heard that before but i have heard that sperm is good for your hair, nails and your skin because it has alot of protien in it, but I've never heard that mayonnaise is good for your hair, i have with eggs, if you suffer with greasy hair rub the egg whits into the roots of your hair for a few weeks and it's supose to get rid of it, and yes it does come back but not as much as what it used to!!|`|5b0ee20e6ce7aff5b80e7c3eca5d30bfaa	Well mayo is good for your hair because mayo has alot of calcium . I have never heard of eggs.|`|a3810a8005aa6b2b82c0fa76afc2daadaa	Mayonnaise is excellent for conditioning hair. Massage it through, and preferably keep it in overnight (put your hair in a plastic bag or something, to avoid getting mayonnaise all over the pillows). Again, rinse out carefully in cool water. If you use hot, the mayonnaise will set in your hair and will be very difficult to get out. Beer also gives a lovely shine to hair. Rinse your hair in beer in the shower, then rinse out with water. Use a beer that does not smell too strongly, or you will give people the wrong impression at work. Shampoos based on beers used to be popular though they do not seem to be around at the moment.They never smelled of beer.|`|j1N2Xi6baa	Mayonays is suppost to add calcium and stuff to your hair but it doesn't make it look nice. it makes hair very greasy.

7NuZUXyQaa	First off please never go to a nail salon for your waxing. Nail technicians have no formal training to do any type of waxing. Waxing is not under the scope of their licensing. Some states allow it but nail techs are not trained to do it. I have never heard of putting lemon juice in a wax or applying it afterwards. The lemon juice is probably to remove dead skin that can clog the open pores and cause bumps. Try applying a mild salicylic acne cream to your brows the next day and every other day in between waxing. Be sure to discontinue the creams 2-3 days before your next waxing to prevent skin lifts.|`|GBzhVSAEaa	I don't know if lemon juice makes any difference.

Lo más importante es prevenir. Utilice Anti-Blemish Solutions Anti-Bacterial Facial Soap ma?ana y noche para una limpieza suave pero eficaz que no reseca la piel y previene los granitos. Cuando tenga un brote de granitos utilice por la noche Anti-Blemish Solutions Night Treatment Gel en las zonas afectadas, le ayudará a eliminar esos granitos rápidamente. Por la ma?ana aplique en las zonas afectadas Anti-Blemish Solutions Spot Treatment Gel: acelerará la curación de los granitos y le permitirá maquillarse si lo desea. Para desmaquillarse utilice Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleansing Foam, que además es preventiva. <br>     <br>      Y después del grano, ?qué?    Se?ales antiguas de granitos y piel sensible o irritada pueden ser algunas de las consecuencias de haber padecido acné. Aplique Post Blemish Formula sobre la mancha o marca del granito. Si su preocupación son las marcas del acné que tuvo hace tiempo y las imperfecciones de su pie, utilice Turnaround Concentrate Visible Skin Renewer ma?ana y noche después del Sistema de 3 Pasos y antes de su tratamiento habitual. Su piel estará más uniforme y luminosa. <br>     <br>      Maquillaje impecable. <br>     Un maquillaje impecable es también posible para una piel grasa; no son incompatibles. Retire el exceso de grasa con un tisú. Utilice una base de maquillaje sin aceites. Humedezca sus dedos para extender el maquillaje en la mandíbula, evitará el efecto careta. Finalice con un toque de polvos sueltos. Si le preocupa el tama?o de los poros, aplique Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector solo o mezclado con el maquillaje. Para evitar los brillos a lo largo del día utilice las láminas secantes Pore Minimizer Oil Blotting Sheets: mantienen la piel limpia, fresca y mate; son perfectas para llevar siempre en el bolso y para retocarse.<br>  <br>  Ahora mismo sólo utilizo el  Anti-Blemish Solutions Night Treatment Gel cuando me sale algún granito suelto porque desaparece en pocos días. Me lo aconsejo mi cu?ada y la verdad es que funciona.<br>  De todas formas acude a tu centro de belleza habitual y que te hagan un estudio de la piel antes de usar nada.

You can get  laser hair removal surgery.|`|WBJndk5Baa	I would not recommend waxing or threading b/c a man's facial hair is usually too course to get ripped out from the root and the skin on the face cannot take it. The best alternative is the laser which can be costly, but i think the price of those mach3 razors can also add up. Pricing can vary so call around. Most dermatologists have it and many family doctors and gynocologist offices now offer laser hair removal. People usually get 6-8 treatments every 4 weeks and it only takes a few minutes. I would call the lazer semi-permanent b/c results vary from person to person and they might have to go back once in a while for retouches. Some people experience very little pain and others say it feels like a rubber band snapping on their skin. I'd have to say the results are worth it.

Try going for something a little more expensive that isn't from the drug store, maybe go to a store like Sephora.<br>  <br>  If you find that different brands are also making your eyes itch you may have an allergy. If you are allergic to mascara, it'd be best to not use it at all (you could try fake lashes instead if you really wanted).

af76a14c1263f139bac1dc0f24f03d47aa	It's usually started by fashion designers, make-up artists and celebrities. Everyone likes what they're wearing, and do the same thing. It spreads through magazines and tv.<br>  But usually, there isn't a trend for make up because most people don't like to wear a lot of make up, and those that do usually only wear certain make up. For example, their favorite colours, what they like to put on, their favorite style and what accents their best features.|`|G2aOgFFjaa	Catwalk, models, etc. not to sure Lol i just buy whats new in shops and what other people wear sad huh?

HB6ss8RNaa	large perm rods the cold wave type..because i am guessing you won't be going under a dryer at ur grammas house and get the right type perm for your hair cold wave and if you have color get one for color treated hair...make sure if you have alot of hair that you buy two kits for extra solutions...make sure she gets solution everywhere or the perm won't take|`|09RBb1pZaa	First of all, do not perm your hair if it is highlighted.  If your hair has color on it, do not perm if you used 30volume developer or higher.  The size of the curl you want will depend on the size of the rod you use.  If your hair is shoulder length or longer, don't use anything smaller than a white rod.  There are so many "if" questions in a perm.  You should go to a beauty salon and have a consultation done first.  Ask them what size would suit you best and what wrapping technique would work best.  Most places give free consultations.  Then you can just say that you don't think you want the perm after all and leave the salon.  <br>  Have you ever had a perm before?  It's not going to look all beachy & wavy unless you use product in it.  I would really see a hair stylist for help.

7tpAq9eWaa	gorgeous! sounds amazing. just make sure you get someone proffessional to do it, or it might turn out badly. because with so many colours, it could easily go wrong! good luck and have fun :)|`|0f9b2cc233e37affd9dd86a519176889aa	If you get it done by a good professional it might look good. Any time you mix that many colors 1 its gonna be harder to make look good 2 its gonna be really hard on your hair. I've had my hair dyed before I recommend having your hairdresser use a semipermanent dye so if you don't like it you can go home and wash your hair really good right then and it'll probably come out.  Good luck.|`|QBczVclsaa	Well that does sound like a lot of colour, but if its dont professionally then sure it will look good.<br>  <br>  But i do have to say this, dyeing your hair is really bad for it and once youve started dying your ahir you will regret it. So many people do, i mean you ahve to get it redone every few weeks and hairdressers are not cheap anymore (especially where i live) I would just like you to think about it again over the next week or so and if you still really want your hair dyed then noones going to stop you.<br>  <br>  Gd Lk!

Good Luck!|`|6r8gRqlwaa	This is $10 over your budget but way worth it...(the dress from pacsun is)... the one from aeropostale is very cute and summery...Have fun at your dance!!|`|AA11804003	My recomendation is a consignment shop (thrift store). Any salvation army or your corner pawn shop. Don't let the preowned-ness scare you, have your mother look at it or take it to a dry cleaners or other professional store to find out the best way to sanitize it to you satisfaction. You could wind up stumbling on a real find, something from some privately owned business you probably never would have found given the fact that you do not have the means to cruise up, down and around your area. Either way it is unlikely that you will show up to the dance wearing the same thing as another girl since she will likely get her dress from the gap, target, mandee's or some other big chain store and not only will those dresses not have made it to the thrift stores yet, but a lot of thrift stores (in my area anyway) will not take items that came from big chains.<br>  At any rate; have fun at the dance, remember that most or all  of the guys want a girl to dance with them but are too afraid to ask (I was one of the few who actually believed that when I went to my first dance in seventh grade and every dance I went to from then through college I asked any guy I wanted, about 2 dozen dances later and I can't remember being turned down once!)
KyJatBMPaa	i would recommend using hair-dye henna on your hair because it has chemicals in it that are supposed to be better for your hair than regular henna. however if the henna that you used was a natural paste i don't think it will do a lot of damage because i know someone who uses normal natural henna paste in their hair and she doesn't have a problem with it. hope this helps|`|7JFfUamEaa	I wouldn't risk it.<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  Ashley|`|FWJbR3AFaa	i use henna too<br>  you could put beautiful patterns on your skin with it<br>  and if you put it on her hair it makes it red.<br>  it's not bad for your hair

Call around your area and check the prices out.|`|21794e4c035efaed3b542ec5e39b3660aa	i would say $30 and up, dpending on the length of your hair and what salon, and if its done by  pro, then you shouldn't feel too much burning,they shouldmake it comfortable|`|7b6fffb56246e6184ad4b5876006a931aa	not that much if u want to do it yourself, u just need to buy both colors and do one at a time.|`|CAozRs4gaa	depends on where you go...if u go somewhere like a top of the line professional then it can range up to $2,000 but if u go to your local barber shop then it will probably be in between $40-$70.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Between $40-100, depending on where you live and the caliber of the salon

1df56057743b2b42f9559d4bef50e101aa	If you have a Marshalls or TJ Maxx....they usually have good luggage at a decent price.  Check the wheels and zippers make sure that they are good quality.  I used to be a flight attendant and after having excellant airline issued luggage I can't stand the cheap stuff.  Make sure the wheels are like roller blade wheels and not little cheap pieces of plastic.  the zippers should go around all corners with ease.  I always found the luggage is one of things that you can splurge a little on, it pays off in the long run.<br>  Have a great trip!|`|4930e99fd93f418657a2555820e2c9dfaa	Try TJMaxx or Ross or stores like that that you have near you.

gefRvikxaa	Well you should either cut it really short (which I don't  recommend unless you've done it before or like short hair) or leave it the length it is because then you can pull it back into a ponytail when you just don't feel like styling it or when you are going into labor or, heaven forbid, get bed rest.  The layered or in-between lengths that require more time and work are not what you want to be spending your precious time on.|`|b99496b774261dc99c6c7f3470694030aa	The best should be whichever YOU like and are comfortable with during the time.. But earlier on during my pregnancy I just kept my hair long and straight..towards the end Im cutting it short like chin length which I find easier to manage when the baby is born and because its so hot over here and my baby will be born in Juneish/Julyish so taking care of a baby is enough in the heat let alone long locks..but thats just me|`|xGdTLfEAaa	I'd say not to cut it shorter than your shoulders, but maybe 1-2inches below.  (Anything shorter than that becomes the "Mom Haircut" and that isn't a good thing!)  If you want an easy style, I'd say to have it trimmed 1-2 inches below the shoulders like I said, but ask for a V-shape in the back and some long layers, possibly angled around your face to compliment your favorite feature. (Where the hair stops is where people focus -- for example, a long bang might hit cheekbone length and highlight a prominet cheekbone; a shorter bang might hit corner of eye length and highlight the eyes; etc.)  <br>  <br>  Even as your body is changing over the next few months, you will still be able to feel confident and compliment your favorite facial features with a good, simple to manage haircut.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, ask your hairstylist to suggest something that would flatter you and work with a changing hair condition (pregnancy hormones) -- that's what they do and they have experience with it!|`|AA11872348	I would not recommend having layers because that will take more time for you to style it. Keep it simple,leave it the length it is or maybe go a little shorter. A bob might look good,I don't mean up to your jaw line,I mean a little longer,like between the jaw and the bottom of your neck. You may want to keep it long enough so that you can still pull it back in a pony tail.PS. I don't think you should have it cut in a V in the back either,cutting it straight across makes the hair look fuller.|`|af76a14c1263f139bac1dc0f24f03d47aa	Cut it to shoulder length and add layers. Wavy would look great! Just not too wavy. Straighten it and then put in really light waves to make the thinness look fuller. Use thicker fuller hair shampoo and just make it look fresh! Add a cute, small hair clip and look happy because ugly and gloomy pregnant women don't look too nice.

I use CoverGirl mascara and it comes in a purple bottle.. it's about $6 or $7.  I would use blue eyeliner to bring out your blueish-green eyes. A good moisturizer is  Pond's Radiance Restored Age-Defying Skin Brightening SPF 15 Moisturizer. I bought mine at Wal-mart. It goes on extremely light so your face doesn't feel greasy.. YUCK!

iaHgxUVYaa	I hope this helps:<br>  <br>  Bad Tan- There really isn't too much you can do to make a tan go away. Usually, in the winter, my tans get a little better, but in the summer, they come back. I've heard that if you eat snow pears, or other white fruits (esp. pears) it helps. But I haven't tried it yet.<br>  <br>  Greys- There are many reasons a person can have grey hairs. Some are:<br>  1) Stress and Worry<br>  2) Passed on from parents<br>  3) Unhealthy<br>  4) Shampoo & Conditioner<br>  <br>  If you are often stressed or worried, grey hairs will appear. Try to relax or talk to someone about your problems. If your parents had white or many grey hairs when they had you, you may have gotten it too. My friend is only 11, but she has grey and white hairs. This is because of her parents. If you are unhealthy, then, naturally everything will start breaking down. Even your hair. Try to balance your diet. Finally, certain shampoos and conditioners will affect peoples hair differently. If this is the case, you could try some new brand or type of shampoo or conditioner. If none of these apply, you might need to dye your hair, or color it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|af2fbd20a835d6d5a53a0870f1e223ecaa	Haven't you seen Micheal Jackson.He got rid of his tan lines.<br>  When you are blending grey hair there's no way to get rid of grey hair.As you know it's also a different texture,wiry and<br>  coarse.Go lighter instead of darker.Like light brown and <br>  blond high lights.Good luck.Get some bronze spray for your<br>  uneven tan or pills that tan you.Don't take but just a few for<br>  a natural tan look.Get them at GNC.Genetics are so hard<br>  to escape.|`|7EMPeJXJaa	Uhm, ear wax?|`|AA11788234	It's normal.

09RBb1pZaa	Hey there!<br>  I am a stylist and also a specialist for the Jessica Simpson Hair-Do line.  You should go into a salon that sells them and have  a consultation.  There, the stylist will be able to match your color.  Mine is "Buttered Toast".  It's sort of a dark blonde color.  I would start out using the synthetic because they're under $100.  If you go for the real hair, you'll pay $500 for a piece that you may be too frusterated with to ever use.  It's a little tough putting it in at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a piece of cake.  Go to hairuwear.com and there's a video of Ken Paves putting one in someone's hair.  It's quite easy.  There are 7 clips to secure it on your head, so you don't have to worry about it falling out.  But be fragile with the clips, they will break if you're too rough with them.|`|b4622f67dc5f213bc8a77f62e592cfceaa	wat in the world!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  i thought she did proactive

J5Oq3zMFaa	SHEESH girl!  My little sister and I went through the exact same thing growing up, except the stealing went both ways and it wasn't as severe.  I have a bunch of ideas for you though and you decide what would be best for you!  <br>  1.  Talk to your parents about it, have them seek professional help for your sisters obsessive and compulsive stealing.<br>  2.  Talk to your parents about strategies you can use to put a stop to her stealing and have their full backing on whatever you do.  Also see if they will agree to have her replace all that she steals.  For eg. if she steals your favorite new capri's and she gets an allowance (or if she has a bank account), have your parents deduct the price of your capri's from her allowance (or bank account) so that you can buy a new pair.  This way she'll feel the sting of her own behavior!<br>  3.  Have your parents do a systematic raid of her bedroom, once a week or so to retrieve any stolen items.  Should you retrieve your capri's back, then you've gotten yourself 2 pairs of capri's for the price of one!<br>  4.  Go to Walmart or any hard ware store and buy a new door knob, one that you'd use on a front or back door of your home.  One that need a key to open.  Change your door knob to this sort (amazingly simple to do, you could do it yourself with one screwdriver) and lock your door from the inside every time you leave the room (just as you do when you leave your house).  It will be easier for you to remember and harder for her to pick at!  She'll never get in unless she has the key.<br>  5.  Get a much better safe, one that she can't get into nor shake to get things out of.  Have your parents buy you a decent one if they can't fix the problem she's creating.<br>  6.  Hide your valuables under your mattress or any other great hiding spot she'll never look at!  If she'll never steal your shoes (because of wrong sizing) hide things in there.  Think outside the box for this one!<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of for right now but if I think of more I'll come back here.  I really feel for you!  There's nothing worse than having to hide all your stuff and worry about whether or not it'll be there when you need it.  I really hope you get to the bottom of this so you can live in peace!  Good luck with it and I hope some of these ideas have been helpful!.|`|041cc53beefd59e6b01087d11695a417aa	okay, well since she has ADD, i wouldn't think she was crazy with this stealing business...<br>  <br>  hey you're the big sister and she thinks you're awesome...just remember to lock the door next time is all i could suggest.<br>  <br>  i was gonna suggest this, but then i thought it kinda mean, but hey, if you're in the spirit, just steal her stuff back...she could get the picture...i dunno<br>  <br>  she also steals your toiletries...? okay, wow. yeah.|`|X2q7PHqAaa	steal her stuff!|`|1cdsJ3lpaa	I do not think you should be worried, she is just looking up to her big sister for a sense of style and direction. It does sound like the stealing is a bit excessive but I'm sure she will find her own style and grow out of that extreme borrowing stage.|`|CB85sH5Uaa	You should sit down and have a talk with your parents.  They shouldn't allow her to take control like that.

71EqbshVaa	The best way for me to get cheap make up is to actually check out the ads for drugstores ( Walgreens and Rite Aid often have awesome sales ) or Ulta has good sales too. Ulta sometimes has high end discounted make up in their clearance section. <br>  My favorites are 50% off or buy one get one free. It varies weekly but worth checking out. What you can also do it to look for make up coupons. My favorites is the ones that Ulta has once in a while- save $5 when you buy $10- on top of that get something that is on sale. Or there are coupons attached to the product.<br>  Target is a good place to go to-when they clearance stuff and you can get it up to 75% off. <br>  Walmart is good if you don't want to search for sales and/or coupons. For non-sale stuff they have the best prices. They often have promos that are packaged together. <br>  A tip I have for Sephora online is that if you type in sale in the search bar - it will pull up the stuff on sale.|`|AA10060755	mayb at sephora but they might b exspensive.. so target?|`|AA10558154	target has sooo much makeup basically all the brands|`|seURCwftaa	Walmart, K-mart, Big lots, walgreens places like that.|`|vIQuXCMSaa	local pharmacy....try physicans formula line...its really good and relatively cheap|`|xEJiDH5Taa	Target ya!|`|4Mp7bPp4aa	go to Wal-Mart.|`|LLPrQ0Agaa	You can get makeup at Target, Walmart & Giant. I would prefer to get it at Target because they have more of a variety to choose from.|`|QcLaXOzPaa	Walmart, Target, or the Dollar Stores (They have Name Brands)!
AA11462969	honestly you seem perfect to me but go ahead andbe with her! anyways be yourself i know it seems stupid but w/e who really gives!|`|Iy4oJJrcaa	first off, you shouldn't change yourself for a girl.<br>  <br>  but if you must, you should purchase a cheap straightening iron and bedhead styling gel at a drugstore.  first straighten your hair and try to create an angled look and rub lots of gel in it.  if possible, get a haircut with angled emo bangs first.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped.  emo hair on boys is really hot.|`|LF98kAgBaa	common, that girl is laaaame. but since you really like her, i have a really good idea. forget the emo hair and just start making out with random guys. she'll love that.
jA0JkkRLaa	Spill some chlorine bleach on the bathroom floor and let it sit there, and all the stains will disappear in under 30 minutes. (Make sure to ventilate the bathroom unless you want to pass out from the fumes.)<br>  <br>  If your bathroom floor is not bleach-safe, use peroxide creme developer (the same kind you dye your hair with) on a rag. Get on your hands and knees, and scrub.<br>  <br>  The paint on the walls, well, if the Magic Erasers the person above me recommended don't work, you may need to repaint the spots on the wall. It's not as big a deal as it sounds - just go to the store and buy a small can of paint and a paintbrush. Even a can of spraypaint can do the trick.<br>  <br>  No one has to know ;-)|`|wMvLawImaa	I don't think you can

Normally, if you want to make your eyes pop, you choose and eyeshadow color on the opposite side of the color wheel to your eye, so for me, I have green eyes, and pink and purple shades look best on me.  But people with brown eyes can wear virtually any makeup color and it will look great.  I would go for light pink or shimmery gold color on the eyelid, and then brown eyeshadow on the sides and upper lid as a contour color.

1ZTGs3a8aa	Try putting on sunless tanning lotion such as Sublime Glow by Loreal...it contains sunscreen and moisturizer so when you do go out in the sun you are getting naturally tan and fake tan, but still staying safe from the harmful rays|`|VWoQO0gcaa	YOu should put on a light sunblock when you go out. Try a Spf 10 or 15. Stay in the sun more often and you wil eventually build a tan.|`|K4zWrCxEaa	Well, since you don't get out a lot, and he likes to go the lake, take your bathing suit with you as well, and stay out there a while.  Make sure you bring a hat for your son, & put sunscreen on him to protect his baby skin.  But, don't forget to protect your skin with some sunscreen, too.<br>  <br>  Lol, I wouldn't suggest rubbing the coca cola on your body, it will just make you very sticky, and not tan. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|XRFY3HiQaa	I really like the lotions that have a small amount of sunless tanner in them. They build up a tan over time and it looks much more natural. It gives you more of a healthy glow rather than a fake looking tan. I like the one from Dove. I just use it once a day, after I get out of the shower. The good thing about it is you can control the colour. If you don't want it so dark, you can only use it every other day, if you want it darker, use it twice a day.<br>  <br>  So long as you exfoliate well before you use it, it should turn out fine.<br>  <br>  I also use a similar product for my face by Neutrogena. It has spf 15 in it so it protects my skin when I do get chance to go out in the sun and it's oil free so it's nice and light.<br>  <br>  The best thing is, you don't have to worry about your skin getting damaged in the sun.|`|yItWuvbfaa	Buy a tanning lotion like Olay and buy it at Target. It works VERY well.

If you're a guy, I'm sorry if this advice doesn't work.|`|WqbrIKshaa	Hi, there is different reasons between male and female hair lost, I try to provide both for your reference.<br>  <br>  Male hair loss, Male Pattern Baldness or Androgenetic Alopecia, is an hereditary condition which causes male baldness or significant male hair loss in about 66 percent of all men.  Male-Pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss for both men and women.  Balding traits may be inherited from one's both parents.  <br>  <br>  Male-pattern baldness typically occurs in men between 20 and 45 because of high levels of androgens, such as testosterone and dihydroxy-testosterone (DHT).  Androgenetic alopecia develops as a gradual reduction in hair follicle size and shorter cycles in the active growth phase.<br>  <br>  The typical pattern of hair loss in women differs from men.  In women, the hair thins out all over the scalp, but the frontal hairline is maintained. There may be moderate female hair loss on the crown of the head, rarely progressing to total baldness as it may in men. Women notice a reduction in hair shaft size around the forehead and the crown area. This is called female pattern baldness or female pattern hair loss.  As women age, this female pattern baldness begins to develop, around 40 years of age.  As menopause begins, more and more women notice hair loss.  <br>  <br>  If you are healthy and you begin losing hair, then your female hair loss condition may be hereditary.  As with any medical condition, check with your doctor for possible reasons for your hair loss. Your hair loss condition should be diagnosed by a physician hair restoration specialist to pinpoint your medical hair loss cause.  Find the latest hair loss treatments in the following sections Hair Loss Treatment Options, Hair Replacement,  Hair Transplants, Hair Growth Products.<br>  <br>  Hope there is enough information for you to understand..

My boyfriend is Asian and instead of having the typical black straight hair he has crazy curly hair to the point where when it's long enough it's like an Afro AND it's all natural.

Du solltest aber auch darauf achten, dass auch Lack an der vorderen Kante, wo du feilst (oder evtl. schneidest) aufgebracht ist, damit der Nagel komplett versiegelt ist.|`|6b10e1b169fe0e3997418d3b152ebbaeaa	Verwende einfach Unterlack.

Wenn du sehr weiche, biegsame N?gel hast kann es auch daran liegen.

Either way, good luck with finding a hairstyle!|`|gh7YOgKBaa	If your hair is already long, and you would like to keep it long YOU DO HAVE OPTIONS :-)<br>  Ask your hair stylist to use thinning shears on you. They are the scissors that look like broken teeth on one side.  It will reduce a great amount of bulk from your "thick thick" hair so it wont feel so heavy.<br>  <br>  Then when you get your next cut or trim, a couple months down the road - tell them do use thinning shears also.

HaqAQcTpaa	The Glycolic Peel is a safe and painless exfoliation process that removes a micro-thin top layer of skin. This form of skin rejuvenation uses glycolic acid to remove damaged cells on the top layer of skin. Removal of damaged cells stimulates cell division that results in plumper, healthier young cells. <br>  <br>  The Glycolic Peel procedure smoothes and softens the skin, diminishes fine lines, decreases acne outbreaks, evens out coloration and lightens hyperpigmented areas.|`|W8gxGRiKaa	it's good it clear's your face & remove's your dead skin i am gona do it.|`|e54YtWtHaa	Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). These are naturally occurring, non-toxic, organic acids. In high concentration (40-70%) they are useful as superficial peeling agents.<br>  <br>  Glycolic acid peels are very useful for freshening and rejuvenation of the skin. Glycolic acid peels improve skin texture, sallowness, mottled pigmentation, fine lines and acne.<br>  <br>  After preparing the facial skin with degreasing agents, the glycolic acid is applied to the face. It is left on for two minutes (occasionally longer) and then neutralized.So,Often referred to as "lunchtime peels".Glycolic acid causes a tolerable stinging sensation, which stops when neutralized. If the sensation becomes intolerable, it may be neutralized at any time.<br>  <br>   Doctors use a higher concentration of acid; milder preparations are used in skincare salons and given to patients to use at home.Often referred to as "lunchtime peels" becoz  it  in few minutes ,it is ready.<br>  <br>  Skin care after the peel<br>  <br>  .No make-up, skin care products or sun exposure for 3 hours<br>  .No retinoic acid or glycolic acid home products for 3 days<br>  a)Cleanser:-<br>     Cetaphil<br>    Toleriane<br>  b)Moisturizer:-<br>     Toleriane<br>     Hydranorme<br>     Effidrate<br>  c)Retinoic acid cream|`|9d7960bae2df5d5dc6aac3e3db0e6eecaa	run get a rash called the sancho,so then you lol ha haaa haaaa oh gosh that was so funney. Gee I forgot.|`|dS0LILV4aa	Actually, they can be done by a licensed Esthetician (and in some states a cosmetologist) providing that they are under a certain pH and percentage (also varies from state to state).<br>  <br>  Glycolic acid is a fruit acid (glycol=sugar) and exfoliant that can be applied in treatments ranging from acne to anti-aging to correcting pigmentation problems. Advantages are that it works to stimulate cell turnover (bringing fresh, healthy cells up to the surface), and in the case of acne is also mildly antibacterial. It stimulates collagen production, increased your skin's ability to produce an retain moisture, and smooths skin's texture overall. Results don't come from just one though, its best to do a series of 6-12, depending on the condition you're treating.<br>  <br>  It can be slightly irritating, peels do sting/itch/burn, and sometimes (especially with a stronger Dr. peel) you will be tender and peel for a few days after. You MUST wear sunscreen, as peels can photosensitize your skin, leaving you more succeptable to sunburn, hyperpigmentation, and general sun damage.<br>  <br>  Make an appointment with a skin therapist for a consultation before deciding whether you want one. Its also best to begin a regimen containing glycolic acid at home to build up your skin's tolerance for it so you don't develop irritation from a peel. Again, get specific reccomendations from a skin therapist.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolic_acid" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolic_ac...</a>|`|xunzkeofaa	Glycolic Peels<br>  <br>  Glycolic peels, made from alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA), are in the lightest category of chemical peels. Known as a "lunchtime procedure," due to their short duration and rapid recovery time, AHA peels can be used to remove superficial wrinkles and dry patches of skin, as well as to treat sun damage and acne scars. Recent research has also indicated that glycolic peels can help patients with acne and rosacea, making the skin more responsive to other treatments and medications. The procedure may need to be repeated several times in order to achieve the best possible results.<br>  <br>  The Procedure<br>  Glycolic peels are done in a doctor's office as a quick, outpatient procedure. The doctor begins by cleansing the patient's skin. Once the face is prepared, the doctor applies the solution. After about ten to fifteen minutes, the peel is removed and the patient is free to go. No anesthesia is required during the peel, and no special ointments are necessary afterwards. Glycolic peels remove the outermost layer of skin, revealing the smoother skin beneath.<br>  <br>  <br>  After a Glycolic Peel<br>  Recovery time after a glycolic peel is relatively short. While deeper skin peels may take over a week to heal significantly, patients who undergo an AHA peel can resume public activities right away -- almost always by the following day. Some dryness, flakiness, and redness should be expected, as the top layer of skin falls away to reveal the smoother, healthier skin beneath.<br>  <br>  =)

AA11804003	Absolutely. Most combs and brushes are designed to be just a tiny bit tough on the hair, those little bulbs at the ends of the teeth on a hairbrush are there to tug at your hair, removing any hair that is loose or out of the follicle altogether. Also, a good hairbrush or comb is supposed to distribute natural oil throughout your hair which requires a lot of contact  with each hair, this is naturally a bit damaging to your real hair, but the conditioning you get from redistributing your natural hair oils more then makes up for it. Of course there is the additional result of getting rid of all those knots.<br>  <br>  The only purpose in brushing a wig is to untangled it, there is no need to make it healthier; the less you do the better off your wig will be. (Also I am pretty sure they treat the wigs with a variety of chemicals to keep it looking healthy and beautiful, and you certainly don't want to scrape those away!) You might only need a wig brush, but you probably should get a wig comb, after all, you spent all of that cash on a real hair wig, the few extra bucks could make a difference. I would go to a nearby hairdresser's and ask them where to buy the best combs and brushes, even if some are sold through the same distributer that you got your wig from.|`|b67b6b207d6484482b436e4a35975accaa	whereever you buy the wig they should have the shampoo and combs you may need.  even in catalogs they should have options.|`|OxgJB30Yaa	For Single Drawn Cutical hair , yes you will need to use mositure rich shampoos and conditioners.  www.hairbylondon.com sells a product that is made specifically for human hair extensions and wigs.

You could also inquire about a product available to salon professionals that basically strips the artificial colour from your hair. Exposure to the sun, heat, and frequent washings with clarifying shampoos will help the colour fade faster too.|`|0mgnPxIpaa	you can wait a week and that should be good...he can always lighten it with a bleach and then put a red color over the top of it...just do treatments like, redken deep fuel is a good one...|`|G5jsr3rVaa	i think you can wait one week and it would be fine|`|gnJEeijjaa	After you get your hair dyed or highlighted you are suppose to wait 3 months before you dye or highlight it again.

2wBfPVRAaa	There really isn't anything that you can do to make those earrings not bother your ears.  It is just that you are sensitive to the type of metal that they are made of.    You can buy fake earrings that are specially made for people with sensitive ears.  Try Claire's or Icing.|`|Pyu4fQf4aa	They hurt because you're allergic to the metal, you just have to buy real gold and hypoallergenic metals, try somewhere like claires|`|4o9CxQOLaa	There's no point in putting up with the pain just because they look nice. Try to find some you like that are made from a good quality metal like titanium. Or you could get some custom made ones.|`|GfMRewh7aa	go to any jewelry store and i guarantee they sell real gold earrings. your ear is sore because they have some cheep thing in them

It hurt, but it's over quickly. Wear a bra, all the time. Use some sterile gauze inside your bra to protect it. The less the piercings (and your boobs) move, the better (and the less it will hurt). You will notice that you bump your chest into a lot of things. They will be tender for about 2 weeks.     I had mine done at 14 gauge, which is a bit smaller than is standard now. Female nipples are usually done at 12 gauge now. The slightly larger piercing will help it heal a little better and will provide a much more stable piercing. I've since stretched mine to 8 gauge and love then, they're possibly my favourite piercings!    Around here $120 is about what you would pay for both, maybe a little more, maybe a little less.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	I got mine done when I was 23. Cost around $80 for both. It hurt so much I can't even explain (and I have a pretty decent tolerance for pain). After wards, they were extremely tender through the healing phase. I took mine out after having them for 2 years. They kept tearing and getting infected. It was horrible. Now I have a blocked duct that can cause pain. Dr says I will probably always have that and its a common effect of nipple piercings.|`|TjPwxbuJaa	Well, I'm a guy with them so I don't know how it feels for a woman (I suppose it would hurt more?), but they were the most painful of my piercings (including ears, lip), but the pain was brief and worth it. I believe it was about $60 for both. The first time I did them they migrated and had them done a second time. I still wear them and haven't removed them in a long time, and likely never will. I was in my late 20s.  Oh, and even with all of my piercings, I have NEVER set off of metal detector in an airport.|`|afikdpZoaa	Horribly gross.|`|82niQjyCaa	i was 20 x  it hurt alot but i am thankful i did it as it was a laugh   better than having a tattoo as it can just close up   had to wear loose tops for weeks as thy used to rub and hurt alot!!  I cried alot and i have had loads of piercings before and it stays sore for ages x  go for it!!|`|RbsV1JvSaa	theyre kinda cool i was considering getting one, but i've heard they're dangerous. plus its a lot of money for something only guys u sleep with will see. oh i forget how much they were supposed to cost but refer to http://www.ilovepiercings.com for an estimate price.|`|MyjJaoHyaa	depend what kind of nipple you have!  hurt less than a Tragus piercing more than a Lip piercing  costs around 25  gotta be 18+|`|kiJUCYMcaa	my opinion, well no no no no no, i would never do it, never....soz|`|Byty65f0aa	oh its horrible. it looks tacky, it scars horrendously, and the pain is so not worth it. it looks horrendous on a man and absolutely **** ugly on a girl.|`|QKh5gCkfaa	I think as long as it doesn't get infected you are ok. I bet it hurts though!|`|g4vSsMHBaa	i had mine done when i was 20 i think....it hurt quite abit but only literally for seconds and when its done it just feels abit 'hot' thats al so not that bad, i have a nice little dimonte bar in mine...i wouldnt get a hoop they're tacky!!  funnily enough i just took mine out last night as im having my boobs done in a few days so wil need to get it re-peirced at some point    x|`|5osOiwOuaa	there is no point having it because no one can see it unless you go topless, I will hurt as much as getting your ears done prob  It would cost about 10 or maybe 5  You could have it done in Debenhams  Gd luck|`|FsTYPFyHaa	It's painful!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xN1AUaWHaa	They're hot|`|T3iDe3Dsaa	eeew   eeew  and eeew some more.|`|uNdculYPaa	i dont think its sexy for a woman to have her nipple pierce.  but if you must ....      good luck|`|7z7Hyh1xaa	ive got mine done and no it doesnt hurt mine bleed a bit and mine cost 10 and 19 i dotn regret it and it does come very useful during sex lol
hVKYVJ89aa	having a concealer that is lighter than your foundation is what you need, because spots and imperfections are darker than your natural skin tone and need a lighter coverage to make them match you natural skin colour|`|W8gSKNzdaa	it covers them better :) your concealer should ideally be two shades lighter than your foundation to make it look more natural. hope this helps :) xxx|`|AA11531880	concealer is supposed to be lighter than foundation, or else when you put on the foundation, it'll make the areas seem darker than the rest of your face.
5Yh8WN1Oaa	I used to be a model, so I ended up having to wear makeup all the time. I was offered a contract, in which, it stated I would have to wear makeup everywhere, anytime someone would see me.    We live in a world where a woman's natural beauty just isn't good enough. Women are competing with false stereotypes of what we "should" look like. We see on t.v. how we're supposed to look - flawless - and when we look in the mirror, we point out every single imperfection.     I haven't worn makeup in years. When I first started the transition to no makeup, I thought I looked horrible. I was so used to how I looked with makeup that it was embarrassing to be without. But, as time went on, I saw the natural beauty I have and stopped worrying about every little imperfection.     In short, we become used to seeing ourselves and others looking a certain way and when that is changed, it seems odd and sometimes unattractive.|`|z0Wkh9hDaa	All women are beautiful with or without makeup!  Makeup is simply there to enhance and make the most of your features!|`|JVrxIjmbaa	umm. no. just most women dont take care of their faces so they depend on make up to make themselves look better|`|EWR01atlaa	well they don't really look at all different without makeup on. Your just so used to seeing them with makeup on you think they are ugly without a mask.|`|uyWkEbINaa	Because we are.Deal with it we are ugly and when i say "we" i mean some girls.|`|V3mVtfftaa	dang you!  women should be beautiful with or without make-up  just because you are used to seeing women all the time with make-up on, you get used to that. Imagine if you lived in a society that wore something stupid on their faces, and that was considered beautiful. Then people would look ugly with today's make-up.  most women like the way they look better with make-up, and i personally am not ashamed of what i look like without it, even if i would not go into public like that|`|2e16f4a446bcc1c4a776329047757ddbaa	haha|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	lol yeahhh    but im good without makeup it|`|85f5b4fcd39d295459a2a6ee7d6d0b87aa	no, they just look more beautiful with makeup|`|ACaxtw7Paa	becuz everywere u look, on tv, hollywood, everybody has makeup on  no0w its stuck in ur head that girls are supposed to look good with it|`|GZVTLPwuaa	Haha, not at all.. I for one just like makeup, but I'm 100% not scared to be seen without it.. and my man loves me without it more then with it too!!    Maybe your just so used to looking at magazines with airbrushed when you aren't used to seeing the real thing..    Which is beautiful..    Makeup just happens to enhance your features..|`|xhjSPd0uaa	aparently i dont look bad without makeup  i feel like i do, but guys who've woke up with me have always seds i look stunning/beauitful & airbrushed!|`|JlNKUH5Taa	because they have their masks off LOL you are just used to tons of makeup and every ad you see is airbrushed.|`|pXTUMTdEaa	its because the community has recognized women with makeup on as normal.  so now, when they don't wear makeup, they look funny|`|VjkDIvezaa	lol if they have been wearing makeup  a lot it makes their face droop  when they don't. The idea of make up is that no one is supposed to know you are wearing it but now people don't care and cake it on therefore their skin can't hold all the weight of the makeup and wrinkles or turns ugly without it|`|RbsV1JvSaa	i dont know where ur getting this idea from...if its from unflattering celebrity pictures dont believe it. they just take pictures with bad lighting, bad facial expressions, etc. to amplify it. if its that u think ur gfs look ugly without makeup then its probably bcuz ur so used to seeing them with it that they look totally different without it. also, if a girl isnt wearing makeup then they are probably too sick or tired to put it on and nobody looks good in those instances. oh and the reason i can't stand not wearing makeup is bcuz i have some blemishes on my face, but mineral powder makes my face look fine. other than my skin, i dont mind going out without any eye-makeup. if u get too dependent on eye-liner u look sick without it.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I'd never go out without makeup. I think makeup can add to natural beauty, or for the insecure it helps them feel somewhat pretty. I was put down as a kid and made to feel I was the ugliest person around and now I'm a very mature woman and still feel that insecurity. I'm thankful for the help that makeup gives me.|`|69GgJhnWaa	The reason is that when women put of loads of make-up, it clogs up their pores and prevents their skin from breathing, which results in zits. Often times they are popped, which creates acne scars. Also, not all women refuse to go in public without make-up, some just prefer to wear it constantly. It depends on the person. I, personally, do not wear make-up all that often. Thanks to my mom I have good genes and have really pretty skin, so most of the time I don't bother. However, when I do bother I usually have a blast with eye shadows. Men often forget that make-up is not only for looks, it's fun!|`|mxtWuadraa	To be honest, I don't think it's that these women are ugly, I think it's more of a comparison issue. They seem ugly because you can see their 'blemishes' in comparisson to women with mountains of makeup on. They are actually probably very pretty, but because you are so used to seeing us with makeup on, we look wierd without it, which can make us seem 'ugly'. Personallly, I like wearing makeup, but i don't wear mountains of the stuff, i just use it to enhance my natural beauty. Omg i sound like some kind of crazed spritualist lesbian who will start moaning about the hideous monsters that are bras. Jeezz. Anyway.. I just use enough to emphasise my good points, and cover up the bad! I'm not ashamed of what i look like, i just like to point out my good points!!! lol!! =D

MTjyPMzHaa	Ok so This Style would look GREAT on you:    Hair: Pull down the area of hair where you would have bangs( or if you have them) then clip it back in your part...like my avatars hair.    Top: Wear flowy tops, they would look so cute. Try wearing long sleeved shirts under cute flowy tank tops    Bottom: Jeans ( dark wash only )    Shoes: uggs are cute tucked in to jeans or skinny jeans with flats

It depends on your hair because i believe the ghd is more expensive. The bablyiss is good and will get the job done. if you have course curly or frizzy hair the ghd work faster for you. the ghd also curls your hair so you dont need to bring a curling iron and a straight iron on a vacation. |`|DRtXVGhEaa	GHDs all the way.

I have them in pink, you should get them :)<br>  <br>  But, GHD's are more expensive =(|`|VPq3ape2aa	GHDs way better.

LWABEeCfaa	Shampooing is a good idea because it removes oils and other substances from the bristles in the brush. Definitely take the hair out of the brush and then do it.

It also sucks because at my school you are not allowed to wear make-up and if you do you get in BIG trouble, but I don't see the point in this rule so I wear it anyway.

Try to but some foundation and little marscar and lip stick pink. NO I LINER!!!! Girls may think i liner works but all it does is make you have dark eyes you cant even see.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick something up locally, I recommend trying the following products:  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)    These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm|`|SpcYCBndaa	Avoid using products that are rich in moisture. The moisture fills the cuticle, blocking water from oozing and causes swelling of hair.   Do not rub your hair with towel. A towel worsens the cuticle and causes them to stand.   When it is necessary to use a blow dryer, use the dryer in a downward motion towards the end of hair.   Deep condition your hair once a week or once in alternative weeks.   Rinse your hair locks in cool water to seal the hair cuticles.   Avoid frequent shampooing as it encourages frizz.   Occasionally use hair products with silicon in them.   Do not use hair products with alcohol ingredients in it. They can dry one 's hair and make frizzes worse.|`|LMFOUJZhaa	it sounds like I have hair like you  mines very curly, very thick, and very frizzy  After my shower in the morning I put in my hair: Redken ringlet 07 curl perfector. Just scrunch it in, and it works like magic:)|`|o298GAKcaa	yes i use self absorbed shampoo and the conditioner from bed head its great you will find great products on this site its buy 1 get 1 free on tigi which is also tigi bedhead gorgousshop.co.uk|`|GyKkb3ezaa	1. After washing, remove excess water with a towel. Do this by wrapping your hair up for 10 minutes, don't haphazardly towel dry; this will rough your hair up too much. The less hair is rubbed against itself, the better off it'll be.     2. While still damp, apply your styling product. It's important not to apply while your hair is too wet as the water and product combination may weigh down your curl. This can make your curls look limp and take away volume from the roots.     3. When almost naturally dry, use a drier to finish off. If your hair is too wet when using a drier you'll lose your natural wave and strength, advises celebrity hairdresser Kevin Murphy. He says doing this will "stop the tiny elasticity bonds from forming and you'll get frizz rather than a curl".     4. Gently scrunch your hair into a curl and keep lifting your hair at the roots as it dries. A diffuser is a great tool for curly hair. When attached to a blow-dryer it allows the heat to come through without blowing your hair around (which can unsettle the shape of your curl).     Tip: hair is porous and readily absorbs water, making humidity (the water in the air) a major cause of frizz. This is why a humidity protector is an important product to use  not just for curly haired girls, but anyone whose hair is prone to frizzies.     5. Want to relax the curl a little without causing frizz? Apply a hair-moisturizing cream while your tresses are still damp. Section your hair down the middle into two parts. Twist each side until the hair twists in on itself and secure with a band and leave until dry. The secret? Don't disturb the hair while it's drying. Try: Pantene Pro-V Always Smooth Leave in Moisturiser, $6.99.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	You need to probably get some professional products from your hairdresser, like Redken or Chi. My daughters and I have the same hair.  We start with good shampoo & conditioner, then end with smoothing products and leave in conditioner.|`|lzp70MlZaa	first you start with a good frizz control shampoo, my hair is the same way, i like john frieda straighten up shampoo and if you want cheaper sunsilk satin straight works well too, then you get a good leave in conditioner that helps frizz control which both these products have good leave in conditioner, then you either blow dry or straighten your hair, i suggest you used a wet/dry straightener because it won't dry it out as much.     hope this helps! Best of wishes!|`|ytiw1UXiaa	I have really thick curly and frizzy hair, I used to scare hairdressers.  The best advice is garnier fructis shampoo and conditioner, length and strength or sleek and shine.  Keep your hair really well conditioned.  The longer your hair gets the more weight it has and the curls hang better.  Also, if you flat iron, skip all of the brands like conair and try a gold n' hot, http://www.beautybasicsupply.com/Gold-N-... its cheap and gets hotter than regular flat irons so its works better on thick hair.  If you do flat iron, try not to use too many hair products, the straightening creams make very little difference and just gunk up your hair and the flat iron.  If you or your family are not too strapped for cash, try japanese hair straightening, it makes your hair straight permanately, the roots will still grow in curly and you have to get it touched up, but for me it was worth the saving to get it done.  In New York (which is expensive for everything) it costs $400.00, just go to a salon and check prices in your area.  Good luck!!

gc1qCZKMaa	you should take advantage of you wavy hair use a wave spray(like Frederic Fekkai Wave Creating Spray, $19.50) to damp hair and then let air dry or blow-dry with a diffuser while scrunching your hair from the roots. You can also add a bit of leave-in conditioner (Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Leave-In Conditioning Cream, $4) to prevent frizz. If you have curly hair and want to make your curls more loose, you can add a styling cream for curls (like Pantene Pro-V Styling Milk for Curls, $5) before blow-drying with a diffuser or letting air dry.|`|ROAXkZECaa	try straighting it.

5BE4cLJiaa	Hi Keeley H. It depends on your skin tone and hair colour too, because they make a big impact on what eyeshadow you should apply. <br>  Never use eyeshadows that are the same colour or nearly the same colour as your eyecolour because then they will kill away the beauty of your eye colour. Unless you want to use blues, then make it a smokey effect eg. with grey or muted black. Or if you want it bright and glam don't go heavy- use metallics and shimmery colours. <br>  If you use green eyeshadows, then I guess browney greens, browns, apricots colours would work well- they will brighten your eyes too. Or gold, lime-greens or metallic colour versions of the ones I mentioned above.<br>  <br>  Because it's a light colour eye, you need to highlight them with black eyeliner, mascara, over eye liner etc. Or dark colours like dark browns. What ever your choice. <br>  If you want them to really stand out, then you should try opposite colours to your eye colours which would be orangey red.<br>  <br>  These are the BEST COLOUR EYSHADOWS wchich will compliment your eyecolour and make them look SEXY>>><br>  Colours like and near Bronzes, goldens, copper or brownish colours would make your eyes look amazing when its subtle. Test, try and see which of these colours work. Soft peaches will look good too. Nice subtle orange would look gorgeous especially if you are tanned or olive skinned. You can mix and experiment these colurs depending on your eyeshape, hair colour, skin colour and clothes you ware wearing. Never wear the same coloured clothes as your eyeshadow! <br>  <br>  Hope all this helped.<br>  |`|wDRKAevUaa	A color that is opposite of what your eyes are.

But the rib cage is one of the most painful places to tattoo I can definitely answer that for you. All the other answers are about right.|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	Out of 10. Its an 8.  It HURTS.|`|6kxWMPEQaa	Pain varies from person to person.  How much it is going to hurt depends on your body and how heavy of a hand your tattoo artist has.  What hurts you may not hurt the next person or visa versa.  The bottom line is that it is a tattoo and it is a needle going in and out of your skin so yes it is going to hurt.  Obviously thou it is not unbearable or you would not see the tons of people with them all over including the ribs.  The pain is part of the experience.

N6WmqDygaa	I'd wait until your older if she says no, most people would think that 12 could be too young for a nose piercing and that could be your mum's basis for saying no. So I'd go with the respecting the decision but ask if you could have it done at 13 or 14, that shows that your willing to wait for it and it'll give you time to persuade her and show her you're responsible. Everything after the please option I'd steer clear of as you'll just come across as immature and thats the last thing you want if you're trying to show her your responsible enough to have your nose pierced.<br>  Hope that helps|`|KbnAj2DVaa	1. Ok i respect your decision and 2.Arent you too young to get your nose pierced?|`|6dp1bXdEaa	Hey<br>  <br>  Im 13 and i have always wanted my nose pierced aswell.

Think about it. You are going to have a hole in your nose for the rest of your life. It will not close over! Why do yoou want one anyway.

Seriously, it's way better than your nose <br>  |`|EbpLq74faa	I got my ears pierced in 2nd grade, and I didn't take care of them too well.

HD75mkRtaa	Guys became alot more attentive when I switched my hair to blonde. I use very light natural blonde named Pure Diamonds by Feria.Ask for help if you've never done it by yourself, and start from the base of neck and go towards front( the top of your head releases alot of natural body heat and will develope the color faster than the back) But I like my long, straight, layered hair( i ask for Jessica Simpson hair). Trust me on this, don't stray too far from what you like, or you will miss the guy who likes you how you are.  So if you like short hair you will want to  attract a guy who likes your pixie look. And guys like confidence, if you get a new look, and it doesn't feel like you, guys will sense your sense your uneasiness and back off. I've had bad haircuts, sometimes all you can do is fake it till you make it!|`|t5C0Aoy1aa	I like blonde or brunette long straight or wavy, layered hair.

It is cosmeticdatabase.com<br>  You don't have to sign up for the emails. (I didn't) But it lists all of the different sunscreens and companies and tells you how effective they really are. Many that claim to reduce wrinkles & aging don't. I actually went out yesterday and bought new sunscreen that protects against UVA & UVB. (which a lot don't) : )|`|d405cb62c34df189235904266fe2f0b6aa	You could try putting on lotions that have a little sunscreen in them that won't make your face greasy.

kDoomsJoaa	Hiya sweetheart<br>  It sounds like you may have had a bit of an allergic reaction to the makeup remover and i would advise you to stop using it immediately!<br>  Your eyes are really delicate and you can easily get infections like conjunctiveitus and stys which are not too nice!<br>  <br>  I have always had really sensitive skin and find that makeup wipes are best for me. I use Loreal RE.NOURISH that are around ￡4 and also use Asda/Walmart ownbrand for sensitive skin with cucumber that are just a ￡1!<br>  <br>  Mabelline New York Wonder Finish foundation is ￡5.99 and goes on as a liquid and transforms into a powder. It doesnt clogg pores and leaves an amazing finish. <br>  I do have about a 50 different foundations in my makeup bag but it is best to find a foundation that suites you and that you like and try and stick to it, at least for a while anyway as everytime you are changing your foundation your skin is having to adapt to the change and it can dry it out a lot and also give you spots.  <br>  <br>  I use rimmel exaggerate liquid eye liner and the best thing is to dip in applicator and scrape off the excess then slowly go across the lash line with a thick line then get a wet cotton bud/Q-tip then go along the top of the line and remove some of it (so you get it the thickness you want it and straighten out bumps. Once you do get the hang of it you will just be able to put it on exactly how you want it the first time and not have to use the Q-tip to remove any excess.<br>  <br>  There is no easy way to put it on tho to be honest darling just practise and you will eventually get the hang of it. <br>  I find it really easy now but if someone talks to me when im doing it it goes soooo wrong! So just warn ur friends your doing it before hand, i always do so i dont seem ignorant when im ignoring them for like 10 minutes  =]<br>  Hope this helps and if you need to know anything else just email me<br>  xx|`|f7o8T5lraa	The Body Shop Camomile Makeup Remover - AMAZING!

Try Maybelline Pure or Loreal True Match Super Blendable Makeup. And start with a good concealer for stubborn blemishes.

If you're gentle when you remove your eye makeup you should be OK.<br>  <br>  Try using concealer under your foundation so it covers blemishes and doesn't look like you've caked your face in foundation.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)

You have damaged it to the point that it is breaking off.  When your hair is damaged, especially the ends, it starts to unravel like a rope.  As it unravels, it becomes very weak and breaks off.  This is why it is so important for you to have your hair trimmed every 4 - 6 weeks.  At this point, you need to go to a salon and have a conditioning treatment (probably a series of them) and have them cut it into a trendy new style.  Then let it start growing again and take care of it!!  Remember, use a thermal protector when applying heat to your hair.|`|oNgCIrzbaa	It hasn't stopped growing, it has just started breaking. It appears to not be gaining any length becaue it just keeps breaking off. You need to let it rest whenever possible and use a heat protectent when you do style it (kheils makes a good one). Use a hot oil treatment (tresseme makes a really good one) once per week to help fortify the shaft. Also start taking a hair/skin/nail vitamin to make sure that it is getting the proper nutrients. Good luck!|`|tmXw6hCHaa	Of course it will, but you have to stop battering it. Cutting it will help, but don't do anything drastic. I suggest you see a stylist, and they can plan a regimen of cutting and treatment that will best help your hair.<br>  <br>  Dont shave your head!

Try some beige and black eyeshadows eyeliner, mascara. Heres a link: <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.arianepoole.com/apimages/CCC-smoky-eyes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.arianepoole.com/apimages/CCC-...</a><br>  <br>  You can do this by taking black eyeshadow and with a small eyeshadow brush (preferably), apply it to your crease and upper lash line. Take stick eyeliner (Try Max Factor's Eyeliner in NightClub. It twists!) and blend this into the lashline. Next, take the small eyeshadow brush again and apply more shadow over the liner, but try your hardest to use the least amount of shadow u can to acheive this affect. Its so easy to overdo. Next, take beige eyeshadow and highlight the lid and the browbone. Basically, any part of the eye without black. And then take the eyeliner and apply it to the outer third of your eye and and BLEND BLEND BLEND. Sweep the beige over the rest of the bottom lashes. Curl eyelashes and apply mascara. A berry lip color will look nice along with this. If you want a tutorial Id be happy to make one. Good luck!

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	NO PERM, like the others said. :) There is a straightening chemical treatment but it only lasts 4-6 months and costs like $200. :/    Try experimenting with products and wearing your hair curly. It's really fun actually! Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm|`|mxtWuadraa	I agree with the person who said DO NOT GET A PERM!! it won't help and it will just dry your hair out more!!    i've got naturally very very curly and frizzy hair, but i've been conditioning it alot, and sometimes actually leaving conditioner in all day (when i'm not going out ANYWHERE! lol!!) and also using some de-frizz gel stuff, which seems to help alot!! i wouldn't suggest straightening it everyday, as this will also just dry it out!! what i do, to stop my hair from going too frizzy and to encourage the curls, is letting it dry naturally and not combing it through unless i'm just about to wash it! i also use mousse and gels and stuff to stop the frizz.     Good luck with the frizz control!! hope i helped!!! =D|`|CQXGO1M5aa	You could try shaving your head bald.|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	DO NOT GET A PERM.  You will get stick with really nasty hair.  Use defrizzers like John freida|`|9ccCHZHgaa	I agree with Kaylah. Perm will only make it worst. I've also found John Frieda products work.

hLdIO43Xaa	How about a slinky mermaid dress? They're definitely in fashion for summer and look stunning. Not totally a full-blown costume, but yet still has a creative and pretty twist to the theme! You can also wear pretty jewelry like charms shapes like seashells.    The mermaid silhouette contours to the body from the chest to the knee, then flares out to the hem. This is a very sexy look that highlights the curves of a womans body. For this reason, you must be confident and comfortable in your skin to pull off this dramatic style.    Options: The mermaid style can support just about all necklines and sleeve lengths to reveal or cover as much skin as you desire. Since this dress is captivating by design, a high neck and long sleeves will still create an alluring look without being too sexy. If you want to show off your skin, you can opt for a strapless neckline, or a halter with a plunging v-neck to accentuate your seductive side.     The look of the mermaid dress is influenced by the various skirt styles available. The skirt can flare out above the knee, at the knee, or below the knee for slightly different silhouettes. The shape of the skirt and the hem can also affect how the dress looks. A round skirt provides volume all the way around the lower part of the wearer, whereas a trumpet flare creates volume that flows out behind the wearer. There is also a flamenco flare that gathers the lower part of the dress in the front for a Spanish feel.     The mermaid dress can either be slinky or highly constructed, depending on the fabric it is made from. If you want a slip style dress that lightly hugs the curves of your body, light-weight silks and satin are the best choices. Stiff fabrics, however, will draw attention to the construction and dramatic shape of the dress. Either way, the mermaid style evokes images of sophistication and sex-appeal, whether it is worn at a casual beach wedding, or a formal evening affair.|`|jDqpiEcOaa	snow white|`|aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	Go as a vampire, or if you want, get a latex or pvc catsuit and a whip, and go as a dominatrix.|`|5exZ6VIoaa	somthing vampireish :D with a princess/medival twist. like this    http://img6.pimp-my-profile.com/i86/8/6/...    :D

I'm just saying that it might affect you getting a job in some instances because some employers consider it unprofessional. That also depends on the location of the tattoo on the arm too I suppose. Otherwise I would say the idea is good, and it's showing off your roots so as long as your sure you want it, go for it.|`|wYga8wIOaa	Hey, I have a tattoo running down my spine, i was going to get it in old english originally but you couldnt read it!    Have you tried typing it on the computer to see what it looks like?    I don't think 5 letters will be long enough to run down the length of your forearm without it looking out of preportion, how about across your wrist? or in between your shoulderblades, i think it would look great there.    It sounds like a great idea though, and original too which is good :D, just be prepared for everyone asking what it means!

tueQ0ygKaa	I have hair like that, and the only real way to get it like that is to use bleach. Don't buy some store-hair-dye but real bleach. If you do it yourself, it will turn orange. (I have tried about 15 different products and not one has given me the succes it promised).    It will insanely damage your hair but if you treat it properly after that it will be okay. (That means, unfortunately, no straightening for a while) And if you want to keep it that white-ish tint, you have to buy silver-saving shampoo or it will turn into a nasty yellow colour.|`|IwXy8KLVaa	Okay heyya :-) her hair is platnium bleach blonde or white :-) i would say that you should go to a salon an bring the picture and tell them that is how you want your hair to look :-) By the way soo cute :-)))|`|79F1VhEJaa	you could bleach your hair.|`|hgdixjzRaa	wait till your 94 years old. it should work by then!    |`|xJ0HJKlXaa	hers is a wig.. .you know that right?|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	Domestic Bleach will do the trick.    I recommend using a decent brand though.|`|a1esFJ53aa	Just bleach your hair tons of times, the condition of your hair will suffer though, bleach will probably make it very very dry and you may need to cut some of it off     (Lady Gaga's wearing a wig so the condition of the hair is great)|`|eDykHvX1aa	you can bleach it, or slowly lighen the hair until its fair enough to dye white or grey|`|1DT7OUuHaa	Do NOT dye your hair that blond.  You will totally ruin it.  Get a wig if you must have it that light.  Trust me.  Plus, it will BURN LIKE HELL if you dye it that light because it's basically straight peroxide and it's just stripping your hair of any natural color.  DON'T DO IT!  She's probably wearing a wig or extensions anyways, I'll bet you anything.|`|2RzOqHObaa	i dout you woul; like it like dattttttttttttttttttt|`|LtlXSL51aa	are you attemping this yourself? I would suggest you go to a professional salon.   This is actually considered a double process high lift color.   1.Really to achive the correct color and tone you  would need to bleach it, with a gentle  bleach with a developer volume of 30 or higher. 2.You would then have to wash dry see the color you have acheived after the first step then from there determine what level toner u would need. ie 9a 9b 9n 12 a 12b 12 n . Honestly if you want to have your hair remain on your head, go to  salon.|`|LbyRB4qhaa	Bleach it completely. Then white hair dye and toner.  This is very damaging for your hair. So get some hair treatments.    http://www.google.co.uk/products?hl=en&q...|`|WOIZPlbmaa	They say to be able to get your hair entirely white, you have to bleach it 8 times!  However, you probably won't want it this white..   I've had mine done, and I had quite light blonde hair anyway, but it took me two bleaches to get the effect I wanted, and then I had bleached highlights put through.  But, if you have got fine blonde hair.. don't do it!  My friend did hers and it's on the verge of falling out.   But, if you insist on bleaching your hair this colour.. get a really good conditioning treatment, and always use heat protector! esp. when you straighten your hair.   but try and straighten it as little as possible.|`|DpBgY3yuaa	bare bleach xD|`|k4TIq8sNaa	dyee itt or put highlightss in !! i do that :)|`|OLSWVy5naa	bleach it till you look like death then do a purple rinse

QLe4ihT7aa	Sounds like a flesh eating skin infection.  See your MD. ASAP|`|H3PcFertaa	Stop using the A & D, because you may be having an allergic reaction to it. (It can pull out color with the bumps). Just wash it with antibacterial soap, pat dry with paper towels and put fragrance free Lubriderm on it. You should have no reaction to this product at all, and it has healing properties (may sting a bit for the 1st couple of days). <br>  After you apply a LIGHT coat of the lotion, it may 'seep' a bit in a few minutes (perfectly normal) but don't let it turn into a scab, pat it with a clean paper towel until it stops seeping. You do not need to do anything else until it heals in 2 -3 weeks (except keep it out of water and out of the sun). Sunblock after it heals.<br>  I think it is probably fine.<br>  If you feel that there is something wrong after doing this for a day or so, then check with your doctor.|`|RRS9WKiCaa	I dont have a tattoo, but if that was me, i would try googling it first. Maybe even thru WebMD.com<br>  <br>  anyway,<br>  if u dont feel safe, my best bet would be to go to the place and ask them about it. Your skin could have had a reaction to it that u wouldntve known about until it happens. Also try looking up the ointment u used and some of its syptoms.<br>  <br>  And worst comes the worst, just ask ur doctor.<br>  <br>  Hope ive helped|`|ZS0dFI4Naa	omg omg omg.....<br>  <br>  <br>  rip

5e7VGSULaa	they are from Victoria Secret... like all of their pants say that on the butt... dont worry..lol|`|PFC73PuFaa	they're from the female underwear store Victoria's Secret.

Though the intelligence of women who wear pants with things written across the butt is questionable.  "Pink" is a line of clothing offered by Victoria Secret.  You would only know this if you were: 1) married or 2) shopping with your girlfriend or 3) a cross dresser.
b44bfe862fdfa24dc2637363590f46bfaa	If there's a Wal-Mart near you, go to the Cosmetics section and buy this little white and blue tube of in-store brand cream; it simply says "Acne Treatment Cream". The active ingredient is 10% of benzoyl peroxide. It's cheaper than the name brand alternative, Clearasil, and works the same. Clearasil guarantees that using 10% benzoyl peroxide cream will clear acne in three days of usage.<br>  <br>  However, the shiny pink mark you describe sounds like scar tissue.|`|ItJhWTCBaa	Sure, go in the sun and it should heal in 2 or 3 days.|`|J6zY8QDCaa	The shiny pink mark is the beginning of a scar.  As it forms, sun will increase the damage to the skin.  Additionally, if you are using any type of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid acne treatment, your skin is hypersensitive to sunlight.  Either way, you need to wear sunscreen.  Don't forget to reapply throughout the day; once is not enough!  I wish I'd known all of this when I was a teenager.  I'm 28 and have scars on my face that started just like you describe!|`|AA12372714	I remember one time my hand got caught in between an armchair and it ripped off some off my skin, it probably took a few weeks to heal. (It turned pink as well...) But now there is a pale circle where the skin was ripped off..|`|mEtChxCoaa	I have a pimple that i pulled off and now it is red! so you are not the only one trust me! Now you just have to get acne cream and then put it on at least once every day and that acne will go away soon!

4ONb3yFkaa	Im in ninth and i:<br>  wake-up<br>  shower<br>  eat<br>  brush my teeth<br>  get dressed<br>  put on skin make-up<br>  put on eye make-up<br>  put on lip gloss<br>  blow dry my hair<br>  straighten my hair<br>  touch up any mistakes<br>  get my purse together<br>  check my email|`|jTkX9HJyaa	It seems fine to me!<br>  As long as she gets to school on time with all that stuff, you shouldn't worry about it at all. But the lipgloss shouldn't be that bright, kind of a natural tone.|`|LDSL0DUiaa	No, its totally normal<br>  Everyone wants to look good...|`|VRI9zTeraa	Personally I think that is fine. Usually at this age girls become more into their looks and overdoing it would be wearing revealing clothes or spending hours to get ready. Mascara and lipgloss are nothing to worry about either, as long as its not too much. When I was that age I didn't do any of that but I would have liked to have known how to style my hair and look nice and neat. |`|tWofDsWjaa	i think its fine:] You will probably find other girls her age do way more than that. I personally don't like straightenedd hair but it is her hair as long as isn't distracting her from school or anything like that i cant see it being a problem|`|7q5HsXALaa	I know that my morning routine increased in time after I started to care about my apperance and started to care about how girls look at me...Maybe ur daughter has her eye on someone?.....|`|FU5sZqVVaa	It's really none of your concern how she gets ready. At least she is clean and cares about how she looks. |`|rOGIZPjzaa	Not at all. She cares about her looks. Its normal. 6th grade is exactly the same year i started trying to get cute before school lol Confidence is SO important during middle school and high school  and really helps you get through those years and if her morning routine is what does it for her than so be it. its healthy, isnt harming her or anyone else so i i dont think there is any need to worry =)|`|kSXKCMsXaa	thats what i did last year in sixth grade! trust me thats nothing compared to some other girls like heres what some of my friends do:<br>  wake up<br>  go potty<br>  take a shower<br>  blow-dry hair<br>  style/straighten it<br>  put on TONS of  make up<br>  eat breakfast<br>  brush teeth<br>  get backpack ready<br>  <br>  your daughters ruitine is what everyone does:]]|`|AA12021547	Toootally normal :)<br>  <br>  But I don't really find it necessary to wear lipgloss in the 6th grade <br>  <br>  And mascara on the bottom lashes look kind of ..gross.|`|vFaPZU0Maa	Aww its really nice that your looking out for your daughter but thats normal :) |`|Pvp36CRyaa	yes that's normal. |`|IRL73jJRaa	no I don't think it's too much <br>  in my opinion i think it's okay |`|Zb0deAf4aa	No. I don' think it's too much. |`|1Fh5Ku8Yaa	I don't think it sounds like too much. If she was doing foundation, concealer, powder, blush, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and lipstick maybe, but I think just mascara and lipgloss is fine. All 6th graders wear lipgloss anyway. I wouldn't be too worried about the mascara or the hair fixing. It sounds like she's just wants to look presentable, but not look like a movie star.|`|5rOBhQrgaa	No, it's normal for a sixth grader to put on makeup in the morning.  As long as she doesn't put on way too much of it.  Besides the makeup, every other thing she does in a daily thing that EVERYBODY does, like washing your face, brushing your teeth, and getting dressed.  You must be a very concerned parent and you should just let your child be a preteen.  Enjoy life and don't worry so much!! :)   |`|UsinktT9aa	This sounds like a normal morning routine.<br>  Though personally, I think lipgloss is something you put on if you go out at night.|`|D0W5kyt1aa	no i dont thinks its too much. just make sure the mascara is clear and the lipgloss is clear anything else is too much.|`|WMWgiUeLaa	That sounds normal to me :). Just make sure the mascara is clear, lip gloss with some colour in it is fine.. as long as its not too bold. Just be glad she takes pride in her appearance and hygiene!! :D|`|fff497fbd4d9ca93fbbb98e59737a453aa	what does she look like in the end?<br>  if it's okay and not trampy or too old looking she's fine<br>  although i might pull her back a little with the make up|`|LU97BqNgaa	Perfect!|`|Z3NxpPL0aa	Idk, I never wore mascara or styled my hair in 6th grade, and I still don't..<br>  but it doesn't sound bad.|`|VY3uTRNyaa	thats what i do... mascara and lipgloss arent a big deal!|`|UISvqUG7aa	god thats nothing trust me..

uLQ7YVkgaa	... Uh probably. I don't think your hair length will make your nose look any bigger or smaller. Now face shape on the other hand.. that's more of something to look at.|`|kb8xHjCFaa	It would probably be ok if you go for a sort of shaggy/messy crop... that way your hair will be more of a focus... if you have sleek, short hair I think your nose will stand out more... but it doesn't sound like it's a huge deal anyway, I guess it comes down to what will make you less self-conscious!!|`|3zI1zdccaa	Yes. I think short hair can often take attention off of your nose.|`|2OHn6OA1aa	Yea I think so. Rihanna looks quiet good with short hair right? Her nose is huge|`|TWT3zZjPaa	Give it a try, it will grow back remember.<br>  |`|Da8WCIrjaa	sure|`|TPQ3Sz7iaa	yea it's fine, my nose is on the larger side [coughcoughBIGcough] and i just got an inverted bob hair cut: hitting about 2 1/2 inches below the chin in the front and in the back it's about the same length as the bottom of my earlobe. face shape really plays a part in this. i am somewhere inbetween an oval and a heart, like i have a small well defined chin and my overall look is soooo much better than how it was with long hair. <br>  <br>  The thing i know for sure is that middle parts REALLY draw attention to the nose, and they look horrible with a big nose so get a side part if you don't already have one.|`|sHL4wRMNaa	sure why not? get it a bit layered so it has some body, and i think it'll look nice, i know a lot of girls with big noses that have short hair|`|8sWNwSqzaa	big noses look fine with short haircuts with bangs <br>  ex. <a href="http://i164.photobucket.com/albums/u32/yetove/haha.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i164.photobucket.com/albums/u32/y...</a><br>  this is my best friend<br>  and her hair looks waay better with her face then it did a few years ago|`|K3yk6orPaa	My friend has a big and nose and short hair is she's pretty.

My friend has a big nose and got a short haircut and it looked a lot bigger. So, I wouldn't suggest it but it's your choice.|`|fVfusXeSaa	actually a short hair cut compliments a big nose<br>  look at any celebrity with a big nose<br>  they will have a haircut that goes right under their sholders|`|wWTWsPlMaa	It should look fine. Short haircut would most likely frame your face so no one wouldn't really notice the bump. Well at least that's what I can picture it like. |`|ij27M9d6aa	hmm , get bangs, dont cut it too short. wear stripes so people dont notice your nose. this can only last a bit<br>  get surgery   ? soorry im not much of a hlp |`|fKcRXfApaa	Hey, don't judge your self that tough.

You should get all these products in the same brand so that your skin can get used to that same brand instead of using different types of brands for each product as this doesn't really help the skin. <br>  You should clean your face in this order:<br>  Eye-makeup remover.<br>  Cleanse [This also gets the foundation off aswell]<br>  Tone.<br>  Exfoliate.<br>  Moisturise.<br>  You should also get products from the same brand that are for oily skin.<br>  x<br>  |`|7kga2aRBaa	don't wash your face too much!  washing your face too much can irritate the skin and give you more pimples, so leave it at 2-3 times a day maximum.  and most people dont use soap on their face, so i suggest swapping that for the exfoliating scrub your mom gave you.  <br>  hope this helped:)|`|CljWnA5Taa	Use your exfoliating scrub when you are in the bath, the hot water will open up your pores as well|`|AA11281998	use the exfoliating scrub either before or after you go a general wash.<br>  <br>  possibly in the evening you could first wash your face gently with dove soap, scrub your face, then use your cleanser and toner.<br>  <br>  <br>  apricot scrub will tear at your skin though, not exfoliate it evenly.  it can also spread acne because it is not a round scrub, and the pieces scratch at your skin and can get embedded in skin and spread around infection (acne).   instead find a moisturizer that uses 'beads' or 'micro beads' because then the pieces that will exfoliate are completely round, and cannot get embedded or scatch your skin, but will evenly exfoliate your skin|`|tXfNkcvuaa	Use ur exfoliating scrub at most 2X a week dun over use it as it will dry ur skin...not in a good way.  and strip off too much.  U seem to be over washing ur face as well.  Only wash ur face 2X a day...morning n b4 bed.  in the morning, tone n moisturise as well. not only b4 bed.  and please also moisturizer b4 bed.  U have to do this even if u have oily skin.

1RwZZ2aPaa	Aw!! Okay, I'll help!<br>  <br>  First off, you want to be totally responsible when it comes to the mature-factor. The more mature you are about it, the more your parents will be open to it.<br>  <br>  Two, be helpful around the house and do simple things like feeding the pets, checking the mail etc..then your parents might think you've earned it.<br>  <br>  Three, think of something like an essay to say to your parents. Write something up featuring all the reasons you really want and feel you'd like your ears pierced.<br>  <br>  Like this:<br>  <br>  "Mom and Dad, I've been feeling that I'd really like my ears pierced. I will take very good care of my ears and I am willing to pay for it. I think I am responsible and mature enough to have this privilege."<br>  <br>  Stuff like that. Start saving up money, too. Just in case. And DO NOT say "My friends have them but not me!" That just sounds needy and juvenile.<br>  <br>  Sit them down and tell them what you've written up. Good luck and I hope you can get your ears pierced!<br>  :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|lkjjxAK4aa	Unfortunately your parents just seem so out of touch. Sorry, but I just don't know how you can persuade them to let you have your ears pierced.<br>  Girls ears should be pierced so that they can wear earrings, which is why I had my girls ears pierced as soon as I could.<br>  Hopefully your parents will see some sense and let you have pierced ears. <br>  <br>  I |`|Qemwpzwzaa	you don't realise your parents only have your best interests at heart,,if they didnt care or love you then they would let you do anything you like,they care,to them your still their little girl lol..theres plenty of time for you to have earrings just don't rush into growing up just because your friends are,let everything come naturally..be patient,your time will come when you can have whichever dangly earrings you want lol.|`|AA11555369	do it when you got the money to and when you are independent. |`|IEbAfujAaa	how old are you?|`|AA11032008	Having pierced ears is an an awesome addition to your appearance. Plus, earrings make great accessories. Go to the mall with your parents, and if you pass by Claire's (which is a great place to get your ears pierced), just tell them you're going to get your ears pierced sometime later on, so why not do it now?

There an old expression that goes "Monkey see, monkey do".<br>  The feelings you have to conform to a type, is called "peer pressure".<br>  As you actually grow and mature you may change your mind. <br>  Of course you won't agree with what I have said, you only want what you want. This is also part of growing up and you will look back later on and having seen one or two friends with ears disfigured by infection you will be relieved that you didn't have your beautiful ears buggered up.
nyJhBJOXaa	Yes, they're pricey, but they do the job, and when I showed a few people after replacing my Tresemme straighteners you could totally see the difference.<br>  My hair sounds exactly like yours, wavy (not curly, not straight) and quite thick, and I use the GHD Mark IV Straightening Iron, which works perfectly in my hair. They do straighten at around 200 degrees but with some heat defence [before] and some hairspray [after] it should do the trick just fine. <br>  The other option is the GHD Mark IV Salon Straightener which has wider plates for thicker hair. I suggest you talk to your hairdresser, because she will know your hair type and what will work best on that. <br>  <br>  (By the way, if you are completely convinced about the not really working at 200 degrees thing, Babyliss have a Pro230 Straightener which heats up to 230degrees...but I really would advise you getting the GHD if you can because it gives a more professional and easy finish. Talk to your stylist!)<br>  <br>  Anyway I know that was a really long winded answer but I hope it helps!|`|CeEWV8zYaa	OOOh i love GHD's :)<br>  <br>  i looked on the website but they dont have mine anymore :(<br>  they were limited edition pink ones for breast cancer, but they have simlar ones anyways :)<br>  <br>  i think all of the GHDs are probably all as good as each other, but you should definetly get rounded barrel ones, because you can curl your hair (very well, without it going zig-zaggy) with them as well as straighten it so they may be costing you alot of money, but if you ever want to curl your hair it means you dont need to buy seperate curling irons :D<br>  <br>  another thing with GHDs is that if you go abroad somewhere, they adapt to the voltage of that place, because quite often with old straighteners that ive had that werent GHDs ive found that they dont heat up to the right temperature, whereas GHDs do!!!!<br>  <br>  sorry i didnt really answer your question too well, but i hoped this helped anyways :) xxx |`|ByWRzuuraa	The best ones are GHD's own make.<br>  These ones id say are the best.<br>  My mum is a hairdresser and she gets the official GHD make because their amazing :)<br>  These ones:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ghdhair.com/uk/ghd-iv-pink-styler-2008" rel="nofollow">http://www.ghdhair.com/uk/ghd-iv-pink-st...</a><br>  <br>  x|`|vbq0tFRCaa	apparently a lot of ghd's go up in flames |`|nHmAue6waa	Don't get a pair of FHD's as the wire goes on them.<br>  GHD's are really good but if it doesn't stay straight when you are straightening it at 200degrees then i don't think another set of straighteners will work.

There are some good sprays that hold you hair straight -> <a href="http://www.ghdhair.com/uk/thermodynamics/step-three" rel="nofollow">http://www.ghdhair.com/uk/thermodynamics...</a><br>  <br>  + If you feel that you are straightening your hair too much to reduce the wavyness then get a thermal protecter spray -><br>  <a href="http://www.ghdhair.com/uk/thermodynamics/step-two" rel="nofollow">http://www.ghdhair.com/uk/thermodynamics...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|0X6PcVilaa	I used to have GHD's and they were great except they snapped in half after a couple of months and have heard of this happening to a few people.

kjW1fmmPaa	I had mine done almost two years ago now.  It hurt quite a bit at the time, people always say it sounds disgusting too because it's right near the opening of your ear but I didn't even pay attention to that.  Listening to my iPod was almost impossible for weeks afterward because I couldn't put the earbud in my ear without moving the earring around and making it really sore.  It was very painful to move around when cleaning it at first too, more painful than I remember my other cartilige piercings being or my bellybutton piercing being.<br>  <br>  It also got infected really easily.  I've had it for almost two years now and if I accidentally touch it or get shampoo in it, it still gets infected easily.  I have to clean it all the time or else end up with a red bump around the earring.  Ouch.  But it looks great and you'll feel that much closer to a rock star :) You just need to clean it properly and be aware it will hurt like heck for the first couple of months.|`|uPYgASpNaa	Get it done if u like pain lol!<br>  Very painful 4 me.<br>  ***** sleep for ages, took it out|`|R3DY16Biaa	I think tragus piercings look nice as long as you get it pierced with a stud and not a hoop. <br>  When I had mine done, to be honest, it did really hurt, it was the most painful ear piercing. <br>  But its the little complicated things afterwards that annoyed me.

NXgSkmfeaa	Olas...<br>  Bom eu uso lente a 1ano e 6 meses.<br>  A lente tudo depende de um bom cuidado e higienisa??o delas.<br>  No meu caso, eu me adapitei muito rapido a elas,mais como n?o tinha muita pratica o meu cuidado n?o era lá essas coisas dai ela come?ou a irritar os meus olhos devido ter alguma coisa de sujeira nelas e isso perjudicar a minha vis?o.A lente quando transparente ela n?o deixa os olhos artificiais n?o mais no caso de usar lentes coloridas use sempre um tom que combine com a sua pela recomentaria a cor verde-chá é muito bonita e dependendo ela da um tom de azul claro mais bem discreto.<br>  E no caso de vc n?o se adaptar rapidamente com as lentes e ter os olhos muito senssivel o medicoo receita um colirio que é tipo um anestesico pra tirar um pouco da senssibilidade dos olhos e vc n?o se sentir t?o incomodado com elas.<br>  Mais tudo é uma quest?o de tempo,vc acustuma<br>  A maraca que eu uso é da Jhonsons e Jhonson.Nunca usei de outra e eladura por volta de uns 5 a  6 meses com bastante ccuidado e sendo usada todos os dias.<br>  Espero ter ajudado<br>  bjus|`|BSBdFZQXaa	Sinceramente?<br>  Eu preciso usar óculos, pois n?o enxergo de longe - tenho miopia - enfim, usei óculos uma época e depois resolvi partir para as lentes de contato, usei tanto a rígida quanto a gelatinosa e apesar de ter me acostumado com ambas, n?o gostei n?o. Isto quando para ajudar, caía algo no olho tirava, ou ficava numa sala com ar condicionado, era um horror... Mesmo sem anda disto, a sensa??o que eu tinha quando tirava é que meus olhos estavam "cansados".<br>  Ent?o, voltei ao bom e velho óculos, seja de grau ou de sol. <br>  Eu muito melhor, coloco quando quero, tiro quando quero e o principal, n?o dá trabalho nenhum ter aqueles cuidados de higiene que toda lente precisa ter. Tem que cuidar muiiiiito bem, afinal você está colocando no seu olho.<br>  Ma tente usar as lentes, conhe?o pessoas que se deram muito bem e usam há anos, quem sabe você n?o prefira também :)|`|7d87b54157dc271194cdf1f2d0112b4daa	Bem, usei muitos anos lentes de contato, e é super fácil de usar. No entanto, esse ano tive um acidente com as lentes, misturei maquiagem e lente. Resultado, 3 dias sem enxergar. A lente ajudou o resíduo da maquiagem esfoliar a córnea. Mas, acabou dando td certo. Ent?o, muita higiene quando usar lentes. Tenha um óculos para emergência.|`|jHsLYOxVaa	Bom, as pessoas sempre exageram... eu já usei lente de contato, mas somente para colorir, daquelas que s?o por uns dias somente...<br>  Depende, se você gosta de óculos e n?o gosta muito de tanto trabalho pras por as lentes....<br>  As lentes, se forem de longo tempo, tem sempre aquele trabalho... toda vez que vai por, lavar bem as m?os, passar sorinho pra nao ressecar e etc. Sempre tem esse trabalhinho, mas n?o é tanto assim. Basta querer.<br>  E o óculos, já é mais fácil, desde que seja o modelo certo, a cor.<br>  A lente n?o machuca, depois que coloca acostuma. Mas isso depende da pessoa. Deve consultar o médico, pra ver o que ele diz, pois depende do problema ocular.<br>  Espero ter ajudado!

And you're given the right to judge everyone who wears them? What about the ones sold to university graduates with the list of graduates on, hardly the type that terrorise the elderly and binge drink in parks? Perhaps think before you judge in future.<br>  The actual item of clothing is comfortable and warm, more than can be said for alot of coats and jackets made these days! They've been around for much longer than the bad connotations, why do people insist on associating those wearing hoodies with youngsters with ASBOs? Everyone in that mindset really should get out more. They only pick these things up in the media, if hoodies hadn't got so much bad publicity all you youth bashers wouldn't be knocking them. <br>  And it's not just teenagers that wear them, I have seen plenty of older people wearing them, particularly people who have taken part in events and bought a hoody as a memento.|`|u4FU1RlEaa	you can wear a hoodie instead of a coat at this time of year, it  has hood so if it suddenly rains your hair doesnt get wet..

pnHkFv5iaa	I only one one pair of boots, and they suck. I never wear them. I do own a pair or booties, but they're so short, they might as well be pumps. And they're cute. I really really really really really want a pair of grey suede slouchy boots. Like it's the number one thing on my Christmas wishlist this year. Last year I got a pair of faux snakeskin flat boots, but the calves were giant on them, so I had to return them, and it made me sad because they were gorgeous. :(<br>  <br>  Edit: LOL, I totally forgot about my rainboots. I bought them like a year ago from a Nine West or a Nine West outlet and they cost me a fortune, but they're red and plaid and I love them. They were super useful when we got like 40" of rain (and that's hardly an exaggeration) in the spring and the basement at my house and the bank where my mom works flooded. So she stole my rainboots to sweep water (that wasn't in the resume) and she sure did do it in style. =)|`|Za3FTVNzaa	Emus there warm and pretty <3|`|EoMVOWoqaa	my chesnut uggs i love my uggs there soo comfy and i can wear them w anything|`|AA12074640	My favorite pair is the pair I bought in a far northern state which has a real thick, heavy pair of boot liners.

I had a nose piercing and it kept getting infected. Just because I had to take it out for work. Needless to say I just left it out all together. Good Luck in whatever you decide.|`|qaHC0nzbaa	I have a nose piercing and a belly button one. I like my nose one better though, but neither of them are annoying. I would picture yourself getting one  of each, separately. How do you feel about not getting the other ones? Are you leaning to a certain one? I would look at pictures of each one on other people. Is there a certain one you like best? Be careful because sometimes piercings can look better on some more than others. Example certain noses are better for piercings than others. If you are leaning to a certain one most I would chose that one. You will pick a good one. Good luck|`|sVxVKFDWaa	i have my nose and belly done. those are the Two i like a lot better. to me lip is just gross to see and tongue is gross to get done andprobablyy has a lot of pain and aftercare. <br>  If it helps think about if you would look good with your nose pierced,causee i know people that have it done and itdoesn'tt look to good. Also do the same with belly. It can help and as far as pain goes. If you can take a lot of pain then there are both good. I found that my nose hurt a lot. But i got my nose done in march 2008.I found it hurt when i had tfirstst take it out and change it but you can get help with that. I got my belly done about 3 weeks ago and it didn'tnt hurt that much when i got it done. I found it hurts more ever now and then. Like if i hit my belly with something. But the good thing about geting you belly pierced is that have a lot of cute and cool rings that you can put on after. With nose it is mostly the same. Also people will see you nose a lot more then you belly. but belly looks very hot in the summer. So its all up to what you like. maybe ask friends and family and see what they say. Good luck and i bet whatever you get will look amazing. pss. with any piercing it is important to go to a clean place that cleaning their tools and always using a new needle and it is so important to clean you piercing everday. But they will tell you how to do all that when your getting it done. good luck!|`|x1LF6f05aa	I have my Belly Button done and my Lip done and i like both...<br>  However i love how tongue piercings look and would love to get that is i could.<br>  <br>  Lip is a lot of trouble. partly because i'm not aloud to wear them at school so i take the ball out and pull it into my mouth with my tounge when any teachers are present. <br>  Belly Button piercings are pretty.!|`|QfR0Qvtzaa	i have all of these and some more actually i have my belly button done on the top and bottom so i like them all but if doing the lip thing make sure u can pull it off first a lot of people Just dont look good with a lip ring it also depends wat part of the lip u are getting done!!|`|vvP7njBgaa	if your mom will let you get naval then get that, instant popularity, actually whichever one that most girls in your school dont have|`|7z7Hyh1xaa	i like them all but if you want something noticable id say lip and the other arn't that noticable really but i'd prefer belly button x|`|rSautofoaa	do your belly button or tongue.. these are two that are easy to conceal should the need arise.|`|5FMfqhYXaa	BELLY BABEY !!!!<br>  <br>  WHOOP<br>  <br>  ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE AND LOOK NASTY"!!|`|fbd7815be2afc7dd2572a25e5273298eaa	belly!<br>  ah but you are a braver women than me!<br>  good luck!|`|axkKrhcDaa	nose.

a1410d51308a8c9ff4170b9842b2b14faa	I'm afraid the only real answer is to take care of the hair at the very roots and maybe stop dying it so that when that grows out it'll be healthy.<br>  <br>  However, short term answers to your question, I advise you try all of them, are:<br>  <br>  1) Start using conditioner all the time if you don't already. Ensure it is one for dry/coloured hair, and once a week leave it to soak in for about 10 mins, sort of like a face mask for your hair, before washing it out.<br>  <br>  2) Use heat protection spray like crazy, but spray it from a distance when using straighteners so that the straighteners don't frazzle your hair and exacerbate the problem. <br>  <br>  3) Invest in some good quality serum, and use it after you use anything hot and/or electric on your hair. <br>  <br>  So basically, the answer to your problem is to use a LOT of product, in the CORRECT way. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, <3 Emily<br>  <br>  |`|gJ3Gr12Yaa	As much as possible, use natural and organic hair-care products. Many commercial shampoos, conditioners, and rinses contain chemicals that in the long run can damage the hair. Daily or regular shampooing, rinsing, and conditioning with natural products can help keep hair healthy and beautiful. Looked for hair care products with wheat germ, jojoba, and/or coconut oil, keratin, vitamins such as biotin, panthenol, vitamin A, E and essential oils. When applying shampoo, be sure to massage the scalp, as this activates circulation and energy flow, and stimulates hair at the roots. As much as possible, avoid using electric hair dryers, hot curling irons and let the hair dry naturally.<br>  <br>  Maintaining a healthy lifestyle which includes proper diet and nutrition is a major key to beautiful hair. <br>  - Avoiding Chlorine, Chemicals, And Salt Water (If you swim alot that is)<br>  - Avoid wearing headgear<br>  - Never put your hair in any kind of style that will put undue stress on the individual hairs<br>  -Be *extremely* gentle with your hair when it is wet. Don't rub your hair vigorously with a towel<br>  |`|aBGlsGL5aa	Try this:<br>  <br>  *Wash your hair every other day, and condition it daily. Don't use a lot of conditioner. A quarter-sized amount should be plenty.<br>  *Scrub your scalp well when washing it, just like they do in salons when you're getting your hair shampooed. This will help bring natural oils back into your hair. <br>  *Avoid blow drying your hair as much as you can. Towel drying your hair is healthier for it.<br>  *If you dye your hair a light color, you might want to consider going darker for a while. Lighter hair color is harder on your hair than darker.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|rqQATK0laa	I recommend avon shampoo it works pretty good and they can make your hair look healthier<br>  <a href="http://shop.avon.com/shop/product_list.aspx?from=product_list.aspx&level1_id=300&level2_id=341&cat_type=C" rel="nofollow">http://shop.avon.com/shop/product_list.a...</a>|`|VMFVkdLuaa	use head and shoulders shampoo <br>  and then use herbal essences conditioner|`|GQCgVg1taa	take one type of dye that u havent used then use it and dont over dye|`|qpln6o9Yaa	Try this...beat 3 or 4 (depending on how much hair you have) egg yolks in a bowl. Put the yolk mixture all over and through your hair. Wrap your head in a hot towel for 40-45 mins. Wash with a moisturizing shampoo. The cholesterol in the yolks is great for damaged hair. |`|utbfT0APaa	Step1Apply one cup of mayonnaise to your damp, freshly washed hair. You may use a little more or less depending on the length of your hair. Coat all the strands from the roots to the ends. Cover the hair with a shower cap and allow it to sit on the hair for about 30 minutes. Wash with a gentle shampoo and allow hair to air dry. <br>  Step2Mash one-half of an avocado, one-half banana, and one egg yolk together and apply the mixture to damp, freshly washed hair. Coat all the strands from the roots to the ends. Cover the hair with a shower cap and allow it to sit on the hair for about 30 minutes. Wash with a gentle shampoo and allow hair to air dry. <br>  Step3Mix one egg with one tablespoon of almond oil, one tablespoon of coconut oil and two tablespoons of honey and apply the mixture to damp, freshly washed hair. Coat all the strands from the roots to the ends. Cover the hair with a shower cap and allow it to sit on the hair for about 30 minutes. Wash with a gentle shampoo and allow hair to air dry. <br>  Step4Warm one-half cup of sunflower oil mixed with one-half cup of wheat germ oil and one tablespoon of honey. Apply the mixture to damp, freshly washed hair. Coat all the strands from the roots to the ends. Cover the hair with a shower cap and allow it to sit on the hair for about 30 minutes. Wash with a gentle shampoo and allow hair to air dry. <br>  Step5Avoid using rubber bands on your hair; only use coated hair bands to hold ponytails or braids. Pat your hair dry instead of rubbing it. Keep split ends trimmed off from the ends of your hair. Avoid using curling irons or hot rollers. Alternate these home remedies using one a week to restore the shine and luster of your hair. <br>  |`|7tpAq9eWaa	One thing that makes it shiny and healthy is beer. Buy some really cheap beer, because it doesn't matter what kind, or some beer which went flat and you're not going to drink anyway. Then pour it into your hair, and massage it in a little bit, make sure it's spread. Then rinse it out but don't shampoo your hair to get the maximum effect. There is also beer shampoo for it but just beer tends to work better.<br>  Now, to repair your hair, and not just make it look healthier, I suggest using Garnier Fructis if they have it where you live. They have some really good ones like Nutri Repair and Oil Repair and those, and also the rest of them work really well to make your hair look good. I use them every day (my hair goes greasy too fast, so I have to wash it daily) and it's so good for my hair. i used to get split ends all the time and I don't anymore. To make the hair look super shiny, I would suggest switching shampoo every 14 days, or whenever you run out of one bottle. So never buy the exact same twice a row, because when you switch shampoo, it helps a lot too. Using the same shampoo for a long time let's it lose its effect. Just switch from oil repair to nutri repair or whatever. <br>  Good luck! And remember to brush your hair. Not too much, but just make it knot free, gives it volume too. There's also some hair spray things, but they're not like hair spray for keeping its shape, but its for healing it too. I have NO CLUE what they're called but I have one which my mom bought me, too bad it's froM germany so I have no clue what it would be in english. Anyway, just look for hair products to regenerate hair! And remember to trim your hair every once in a while to stop split ends and give it volume. :)|`|ACRIa6YRaa	Heat olive oil for a few seconds in the microwave and apply to dry hair and leave on for 10-15 minutes prior to your shampooing.  Also, if your hair is really damaged, it will take quality products to get it back on track.  Try Redken.  Also, a Sebastian Laminates Cellophane treatment gives AMAZING results after just one use.  Good luck.|`|OGHXUem5aa	use organix shea butter shampoo its $4.99 and buy the cholesterol conditioner queen helen $2.99 for deep conditioning- do it  two or three times a week-<br> try it-<br> it woeked for me-<br> and its cheap- don't buy the herbal essecen...or other brands-- they won't work on ur hair/scalp- also try natural treatments (mayo with eggs-no yolk) also <br> honey-olieve oil-eggs-and vitamin e oil help a lot-<br> coconut oil didn't work for me but u can try it if u want to-<br> <br> <br> good luck!!!!|`|1ksrcsYzaa	try washing it for once

Levanta la barbilla<br>  Al maquillarnos tendemos a bajar la cabeza de manera instintiva. Error. Cuando estés frente al espejo, estira bien el cuello y sube la barbilla. ?Te verás mejor y tendrás una perspectiva más real y favorecida de la cara. ?O es que vas por la calle mirando al suelo?? dice Charlotte Tilbury de Helena Rubinstein. <br>  <br>  2. Utiliza brochas cortas<br>  Empieza por su versión mini, te ayudarán a tener mucho más control sobre los trazos que realizas. Prueba el set de viaje de Bobbi Brown.3. El ‘must’ del neceser<br>  Actrices y modelos famosas coinciden en algo: llevan un colirio que combate el enrojecimiento y la fatiga de los ojos y da más luz. Si el oftalmólogo no te prescribe otro, van muy bien los formulados con ingredientes como el agua de hammamelis.<br>  <br>  4. Afina la mandíbula<br>  ?Cómo corregir el óvalo de la cara? Aplica un fondo más oscuro sobre el hueso de la mandíbula y un toque de polvos más claro en el centro de la barbilla. Para afinar todo el rostro, cubre la totalidad del contorno con un tono más oscuro.  <br>  <br>  5. Adiós a las bolsas<br>  La retención de líquidos es la causa fundamental de la aparición de bolsas bajo los ojos. Para atenuarlas, además de un tratamiento continuado que ataque el origen del problema, también es útil un automasaje en la zona: prueba peque?os movimientos circulares de dentro hacia fuera y a la inversa. Hazlo tres minutos y justo antes de maquillarte. <br>  <br>  6. Labios ‘Push-up’<br>  ?Una boca con más volumen? Antes de pintarte los labios, cepíllalos suavemente mediante movimientos circulares con un cepillo de dientes. ?Se activa la circulación y se logra un efecto plumb inmediato, aunque pasajero?, se?ala Matthew Van Leeuwen, quien lo logra en los labios de Scarlett Johannson. Si quieres un efecto más intenso, aplica sobre el cepillo sal de cocina.<br>  <br>  7. Rojo de día<br>  Si no te sientes cómoda con una boca en rojo intenso, haz como Pilar Lucas cuando maquilla a Esther Ca?adas: no perfiles los labios, y maquíllalos con el dedo -impregnado del color elegidomediante toquecitos. impregnado del color elegidomediante toquecitos. <br>  <br>  8. Impecables por tiempo<br>  Antes de aplicarte la barra, extiende una base de maquillaje clarita y polvos sueltos. Otra opción es utilizar un lápiz específico como Perfect Lips de Sephora. Se camuflan imperfecciones y arruguitas, tus labios lucen más lisos y el color permanece inalterable durante horas. <br>  <br>  9. Corrige el gesto<br>  La piel oscura encima de la comisura de los labios superiores te hace parecer enfadada. Para corregirlo, ponte un poco de corrector de ojeras. <br>  <br>  10. Más grandes<br>  Perfila tus labios con una línea beige, muy fina, por la línea exterior, insistiendo en el pico central del labio superior. Parecerán más grandes y con más volumen. <br>  <br>  11. Sexys y carnosos<br>  Después de maquillarlos, aplica un tono más claro en el centro del labio superior y un toque de gloss en el centro del inferior. <br>  <br>  12. Bien perfilados<br>  Para un resultado perfecto y natural, perfila los labios después de aplicar la barra, y no al revés. Corrige y suaviza cualquier imperfección con un pincel como el Lip Brush de Bobbi Brown. <br>  <br>  13. Aclara el color<br>  Transforma el tono oscuro de una barra de labios en uno más claro, mezclándolo con una gotita de tu fondo de maquillaje habitual. <br>  <br>  14. Besos sin rastro<br>  Para evitar que un gloss demasiado pegajoso moleste en la boca o incluso se pegue en el pelo, besa suavemente un kleenex. <br>   15. Boca mordida<br>  ?Cuando más bonito está el maquillaje de labios es a las dos horas de llevarlo ? dice Baltasar G. Pinel de MAC. Este efecto se puede lograr desde el primer momento ?si aplicas generosamente rouge granate intenso media hora antes de empezar a maquillarte. Acto seguido, retíralo completamente con un tisú. Los labios se habrán te?ido con un espectacular bajo tono burdeos ultrasuave y lucirán el misterioso efecto de boca mordida.? <br>  16. Piel Afina la nariz<br>  Aplica polvo muy claro, incluso con acabado perlado, sobre el hueso de la nariz, y otro más oscuro y mate, justo en los laterales, sin llegar al fondo. Es un truco que Charlotte Tilbury, directora artística de Helena Rubinstein, utiliza siempre que maquilla a la actriz estadounidense Jennifer López. <br>  <br>  17. Mezcla tonalidades<br>  El mismo fondo de maquillaje por toda la cara crea un efecto plano. Mauro Sacoccini propone mezclar diferentes tonos para marcar volúmenes, conseguir luz y corregir el óvalo. ?El más claro debe aplicarse en la zona T -frente, nariz y barbilla-, bajo los ojos y sobre los pómulos. El más oscuro, desde el lóbulo de la oreja, hacia la mandíbula, difuminándolo bien hasta el cuello.? <br>  <br>  18. Frescor irisado<br>  ?Te gustan los looks frescos y de apariencia mojada pero no quieres prescindir de los polvos que tienen el efecto contrario? ?Prueba a aplicar un producto que contenga polvos irisados o nacarados en tono champán o perlado y distribúyelo uniformemente por los laterales del rostro, párpados y barbilla?, dice Baltasar G. Pinel. <br>  19. Cosméticos secantes<br>  Serán tus a

0ZrXE71daa	practice makes perfect. get your self some make-up remover wipes and sit down and keep trying until you get it right! thats exactly what i did. i would keep trying and wipe off what i messed up and began again! and again and again! practice practice practice.<br>  steady hand!<br>  <br>  here is what i do. place your middle finger in the far corner of your eye (the corner thats  next to your hair line) and pull on it so that your eye closes down. this pulls the skin on your eye tight. then from there draw from the outside in.|`|da95b8f182d910bfee6733e10dbcdebcaa	yes I think we all have the same problem, I find if I rest my elbow on a hard surface, it keeps my hand steadier. I usually draw a line first with a pencil eyeliner then go over it when I am happy with the line and I always do the flicks with pencil as it is a pain in the **** to keep rubbing liquid off. Also after applying the eyeliner wipe over your lashes with a face wipe as it tends to clog them up if you put your mascara on straight after.<br>  <br>  Good luck xxx|`|QNQL6jBEaa	ooh i have this problem i think i might be able to help..<br>  <br>  follow your lid line gently along, try not to stop or readjust your position that you're holding the brush with. when it gets to the flick, i dont really know how to make it even lol its always gonna be a bloody problem so keep it simple and start off really thin when you're doing it. if it goes right and you think it needs to be thicker, trace the same line pushing down a bit harder...<br>  <br>  the top eyelid is a bugger but i hope this answer helped :)|`|VEXwmmNSaa	I understand your pain!!! I have the saaaame bloody problem!!|`|c0MwfVC4aa	Liquid eyeliner is a bad idea! Looks too hard!<br>  <br>  Always use a Kohl pencil above and below the eye, and pat it gently to soften the look!

What you want to use to change the mistake depends on what you used to make the mistake in the first place. In cases like this it is better to go to a salon or try a college cosmetology department. They have licensed teachers that help the students do salon services and you get a great color for less than half the price, in most cases. They will know what needs to happen to "fix" your hair.<br>  <br>  Just remember that hair can be damaged to the point where you have to cut it off to get a fresh start so make sure what you put on it is what you want.|`|ae1bcafc7941b36f93bb3965b18a04caaa	If you haven't done a lot to your hair in the past, you shouldn't have to wait very long to change the color back. Once, when my hair was black, I bleached it and dyed it 'red'. When I didn't like the awful orange color it turned out, I went back and got more hair dye and colored it black again, all within a 24 hour period. It's not good for your hair, but it happening once shouldn't hurt. Good Luck!

Also...what is your skin tone? Since you're blonde (assuming it's natural), then you're either a Spring or Summer season for coloring. But it's your skin tone that you need to know. Red does not look good on a person with Spring colors, but a lighter red will look great on someone who is a Summer.<br>  <br>  Check out the color pallet and description of both the warm and cool skin tones, then you can figure out which color to wear.<br>  <a href="http://www.mineral-makeup-reviews.com/Cool-or-Warm-Skin-Tone.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mineral-makeup-reviews.com/Co...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I just checked out your other questions to see if you had a pic with any of them.

7tpAq9eWaa	Wear grey jeans, and then a white formal ish shirt. don't wear a tie. You can wear a jaquette or whatever they're called over. That's the semi formal look, which I think will go perfectly. Don't show up in a full suit or tux!! Mix casual and formal. :)|`|A0PPXS5uaa	well i think waist coat is ideal and slick|`|jqAG9Ywxaa	black khakis (semi formal) and a loose white dress shirt (not tucked in) your look like a guy who is semi formal, formal but in a cute way. 
7tpAq9eWaa	Just go to H&M or other children stores. They tend to have loose clothes anyway, and then just get a size up. For kids it's not as vital that it fits perfectly and has the perfect sleeve length. I doubt there's a place you can buy plus size kid's clothes at normal prices, so I guess that's your best shot. :)<br>  And to make kids lose weight, just give them healthy alternatives to their food bit by bit - don't suddenly only have healthy food, but gradually change it. So instead of fries, have a salad or something. NEVER say "it's healthy", say something like "I tried something new, do you like it?" As if it's just like the normal food. Then have fat reduced milk products, the taste tends not to be very different. And encourage them to do sports without saying "it's good for you", maybe get together with other parents and organize a saturday group that all play soocer(football)/basketball or whatever. Reverse psychology works well for kids, and you have to let them get the idea in their head that it's fun without you telling them it is.|`|7OtGCvcOaa	i didn't know there was such a thing as plus sizes for 7 year olds<br>  maybe you should loose weight or something or try and fit into adult sizes|`|rOkbD98Gaa	Never heard of plus size 7 year olds...cant you just buy a couple sizes up!?

7tpAq9eWaa	If the gold plait is gone, there isn't really a way to stop the smell unless you get it plated again. Thing is, iron (which I presume your necklace is made of) and bad quality steel, once the plate is gone, rust and go copper-colored, and also, it turns the skin underneath blue. it's because it oxydises. I would either buy a new necklace, which is probably cheaper, or get this one plated at a jewelers. :)|`|VihV4Troaa	as far as i know, i'm pretty sure copper will always smell like copper. you're best bet is to go to a jeweler and see what they think. maybe they could give you a solution or cleaner.

I am sorry you are not feeling your best physically. First, it is great that you want to work on your weight issues but there is really no quick way to lose weight safely. I suggest making some lifestyle changes. Start eating better and exercising more. Perhaps you can get a pedometer and count your steps. I think we are supposed to take 10,000 steps a day. Increase veggies and fruits in your diet, too. You cannot make  yourself taller. We are all programmed to be a certain height. My daughter wants to be taller, too. She is only 5'1" at 16 and the doctor says she is done growing. This is just not something we have control over. As far as your looks go, work with what you have and learn to accept who you are. It is easy to be critical of one's self at your age. You are young and your appearance will continue to change as you grow older. Be a good person and love who you are. The rest will come in time. <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you.|`|oVd2Zvptaa	drink lots of water when u eat so u won't gain as much lbs.<br>  walk around ure house for 15-20 min. every day<br>  try to cut down on junk food and white rice which can make u get fat<br>  eat fruits + vegetables every day- an apple, a banana, n broclii, carrots, beans ,,etc.<br>  also if u can go on elliptical for about an hour 3 times a week and u will see reults soon|`|XmRZU8y1aa	ALl you need to do is stop eating junk and exercise.  No chocolate bars, chips, ice cream or soda.  Join sports teams, go for long walks daily.   Get a nice haircut, and have fun with friends.

Usually, when someone posts something like this, I just tell them to hold their head high- but 171 lbs. is really unhealthy. Chew gum to mute the craving a bit- whenever I get too hungry (I'm around 110-115 lbs. and 5'5) I gargle some mouthwash and swish it around. If I feel like it I eat a grape- it tastes gross but not like throw-up gross, just weird. The Halloween season is still going and you eat a lot of candy then. Give some of it away! <br>  <br>  Also, my sister and I play tennis and it helps us stay active and we're in Academy, so they make us do fitness (half hour) with a few trainers after an hour and a half of tennis is over. Over the summer, I went to a performance academy "camp" where they pushed us really hard and it was so important to eat healthy otherwise you would throw up on court- or at least feel like it. Abs exercises are really great- at first they feel like torture but then like 40 sit ups feels like nothing.<br>  <br>  Don't bother with too much eye liner and there's really no way to grow taller. Just treat your body nicely!<br>  <br>  Is your skin condition good?<br>  <br>  xD|`|BuYDaZJyaa	girl, you are wayyy too young to be worried about this. I guess I kinda felt the same way in middle school; I thought I looked like a boy because I had some seriously bushy eyebrows & I didn't wear any makeup. when you get out of middle school & start growing up, you start looking & feeling a LOT better about yourself. you grow out of your ugly stages & become more beautiful. & if you don't, then you probably don't know how to help yourself grow out of that stage. stop worrying about the way you look in middle school, everyone looks awkward at that stage!|`|GCuGDMZraa	im 19 and i have days like that too! I get dressed at home and think i look great...and then i see myself at uni and im like UUURGH.<br>  Being beautiful/pretty is half in the mind, and half in your looks.<br>  When the two connect you think you look awesome... ;)<br>  Like, when you buy a new top and wear it and it looks good on you...you FEEL good, dont you?<br>  If you can make yourself FEEL good about yourself, than i assure you, you'll soon feel pretty too!<br>  When you look in the mirror you wont notice the little flaws that only YOU can..instead you'll zero in on something good instead.|`|Honw9RF0aa	oh my god. just LOSE WEIGHT, i cant believe how lazy people really are.|`|P2fnY2rnaa	I agree with the first answerer. when i  was your age i felt bad about a lot of things with myself. Now i am older and i am actually happy about many of the things i felt insecure about. fx I thought i had a weird butt because girls kept pinching it, staring at me when i was in tight pants and telling me to turn around.. now i know the real reason ;)<br>  try to loose some weigth but at the same time start to accept yourself. When you get older you will naturally become happier with yourself but why wait when you can become happy now!|`|ligCq7jKaa	Okay I don't want to sound like a mother but I think at age 12 you  don't really need any sort of makeup. As for the weight issue you need to start exercising start slowly and then you can gradually increase the amount of exercise. The best thing to do is go to your family doctor and he/she can start you on a diet and exercise plan. Furthermore  you cannot lose weight fast it just does not work that way. The best way to lose weight is gradually and that way it will stay off with a good healthy diet and regular exercise. Because you are so young you have a higher metabolism that will help you lose weight faster then someone who is older. As for the height issue for your age I think your a good height you will continue to grow taller until that age of 15 or 16 in girls. You still have a long way to go. <br>  |`|9cNTkhmQaa	First of all, you really should lose weight, and not only because you'll look better but because you'll be healthier as well.  My best friend is 17, your height, and is close to 210 pounds.  She has to take blood pressure pills now because she's so over weight.  Do you know how hard a life she has ahead of her, especially since she decided that food is more important to her than living a long life?  Besides this, you're 12!  You haven't even finished growing yet.  How you look now is not how you'll look 5 years later.  Stop wearing so much make-up, first of all.  You're young.  You shouldn't even need eye liner or foundation.  I'm 17 and I only wear natural looking eye shadow and mascara.  Losing weight will help you feel prettier because then you get to go shopping because all your old clothes don't fit you anymore.  And then you can develop your own style and rock it out.  Don't take life too seriously just yet.  You have a lot ahead of you.  
7tpAq9eWaa	It's a style similar to emo, but not as black and dark-colored, but the cuts and a lot of the patterns are the same.<br>  It's known as scene.<br>  I think it's really cool if you can carry it off. I love wearing this kind of stuff when it#s all coordinated. Like you have a purple and black shirt, then black or dark jeans, and then purple shoes, with matching jewellery and everything. That can look really cool. But when you mix it together randomly it normally looks crazy and messy. So when you use this style right, it works great. Also, the scene (teased) hair really perfects this style, and you need to wear quite a lot of make up (liquid eyeliner) because otherwise you look pale/bland next to your awesome clothes.<br>  :)<br>  Anyway, yeah I think it's an awesome style!|`|R8iz9ZM1aa	i really dont undersant the quetion but i love all the shirts and pants<br>  <br>  <br>  but all the shoes are kindda weird exsept for the purple ones<br>  <br>  i have ones sortof just like that<br>  <br>  jahah|`|rPB6VqfOaa	I feel like the way you described yourself, those clothes go perfect.

kSsUj2yoaa	i luv it straight it is so cute|`|AJj4ORHuaa	XD dont ever do the pose in the first picture again thats...girly <br>  and wtf a flower on ur hand?!! 0_o<br>  <br>  anyways i think anything besides the hairstlye in the first pic is good,so curly i guess|`|3xXMLVu4aa	curly cuz the <br>  straight hair looks pretty wavy<br>  |`|qhaZEeRaaa	curly.<br>  <br>  one day you will come to love your hair exactly how it naturally is.|`|jUOenDR2aa	y do u have a blue flower in ur hand?????<br>  also it looks better strait|`|A4l5E9GEaa	your a boy keep it the same
CmgZpSVhaa	i think blonde would look prettier on you, but the black does look good too. |`|kGzKbe1jaa	no.... you look so pretty with black|`|7tpAq9eWaa	If you're naturally blonde, stick with it.<br>  I just know that black looks amazing with light eyes, it really brings them out.<br>  But blonde really matches too.<br>  And having to dye your hair all the time gets annoying and it's no good for the hair either.<br>  Stick to your natural hair color. I color (as in, wash outs) my hair once in a while for a change, and because i have brown eyes and brown hair, making it look quite bland sometimes. But blonde and blue/green eyes naturally is amazing! I would stick with natural colors if they suit you. :)|`|j8YJPiC7aa	I like it black.. i would have to see what you looked like blonde to tell you to go back. |`|Z6lhZiXsaa	Try a light brown. I think that would still make your eyes pop but it would go with your skin better than black.|`|rMrcsjxpaa	Hi! I'd think your eyes would match with blonde. But black is pretty good-looking. Make the decision out of heart. Best wishes~|`|oqvenAa5aa	the darkness of your hair accents your eyes greatly.<br>  the blodne would probably wash your skin out and it would also make your eyes pop.<br>  so idk. it depends on if you want your eyes to really stand out (dark hair) or just to have a happy medium. (blonde hair.)<br>  :)|`|lqD8BhtJaa	U know, your natural hair color is a color that tons of girls envy,so why change it? I think you should go back.I'm a black-haired girl,too,so...|`|2f20cfcf8c095be0d9e854bc51d78cdfaa	I like the black plus....NICE RACK!!!!!|`|BDgypGAGaa	i think u should stay black but if u cant decide y not ave black hair with some blonde bits in
7tpAq9eWaa	When it starts to puff up, brush it back down, and then shake it out. It soudns weird. But it keeps it from goinf poofy, but lets it maintain its volume. Until its completely dry, its always important to brush the hair into place. Not too much or else it will be flat, but even just run your fingers through it to keep it down. Otherwise use less of the product, that should work too. :)|`|HS44HUrgaa	frizzease works wicked good for all hair.|`|AA11303185	I have thick hair and when drying it it becomes so think and full, hard to fix. I have been using Pantene Smooth shampoo and conditioner. Leave the conditioner on for over 2 mins. Also after I towel dry my hair I apply Pantene pro-v Restoration Frizz Control Ultra Smoothing Balm. Its about 5 bucks and works. I blow dry my hair using a comb only.
5Xh7y0waaa	It depends how big you are and what your shape is. If it's something that you really want to try then you should go and try a pair on, and see how they look before you buy these other ones. If you are big with big hips they wont be the most flattering thing you could wear, but you may look good anyway.<br>  <br>  If you're a little worried about the jeans, you should team them with a pair of shoes that are close in colour to them so as to elongate your legs.<br>  <br>  Pointy shoes generally arn't good for people with big hips, they are better on people with long, skinny legs, so i wouldn't team the two together. A pair of open toed heels, platforms or both would most likely make you look better, I think.|`|kauRr6X8aa	Yes! Go for it. You can pull them off. I like the pumps with them, try them with black skinny jeans too!|`|af76a14c1263f139bac1dc0f24f03d47aa	Yeah, you could! I have a pretty big booty too, lol. Just make sure to layer some tops, don't scrunch the bottom but fold them up and best to wear with heels!|`|whV7euJLaa	Don't worry about it, flaunt what you have, curves are better then stick thin.<br>  Trust me.<br>  I've inherited my mums naturally curvy figure.<br>  And my nickname is thunder things, but that doesn't stop me.<br>  and it shouldn't for you.|`|rHSh8DDAaa	No..not if you are plus size..sorry!|`|vry6QQUIaa	you should go try, if it looks good, then get it ;]|`|iOdLFRkRaa	Get them in your size, not too tight, and not too low cut. don't go for completly skin tight and they look great.<br>  i am plus and i love mine to death!|`|b7chfKZaaa	go to the store, go to the dressing room, try them on, and decide yourself if u like them/if they look good on you. lol|`|vHRAPrGvaa	Skinny girls can't even pull off skinny jeans. It's a horrible look. Go for bootcut instead.|`|kuaJ0auEaa	go for it!
OpwMuboqaa	Sure, hold it if you don't want people behind you looking at your butt.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	We used to wear those wrap-around skirts.   A brief gust of wind, and your undergarments were open for exhibition. lol  Fashion!!<br>  <br>  Now, since I've been ill, I'm not so steady on my feet.  I have to hold my skirt, hold the rail with the other hand, AND look at the step while I come or go.<br>  <br>  PS My name is Debbie, too.  Used to be Debbie W.  And my avatar is eerily close to yours.  Hmmm.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|NQIKCGgfaa	If you go up the stairs and need to hold the skirt against your butt then that's an indication that skirt is too short.<br>  <br>  I dont do it because my mini skirts are longer than that. But yeah if my skirts were that short I would do it too.|`|dc67b0078408c2b92b074f6a1e985dd1aa	If you work too hard at holding you skirt tight, then you can draw undue attention to yourself and you don't look as confident. I say, make sure you skirt is a length you are comfortable enough to walk up stairs in, and let yourself be covered from how your skirt lays.|`|4d87f83f3ad6de7694ffb113770c2ddbaa	Sure, I do that. It mostly depends on what kind of steps, though. But I've started wearing those really short cheerleader shorts that they wear under my skirts. They never show, and you don't have to worry about steps or wind.|`|AA10947632	i do that. <br>  i wear uniform skirts and jumpers everyday<br>  so i do it everyday.|`|GguHOpMdaa	I hate it when girls do that, its very prudish and makes me think im doing something wrong by looking up.|`|6bklh9eCaa	well sometimes i do with ONE hand. and i only do it if you know someone could be under you looking up.|`|3YYs4OvMaa	yeeep ...don't need anyone seeing anymore of my goodies ;)
