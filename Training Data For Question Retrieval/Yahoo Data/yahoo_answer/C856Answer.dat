mQZDizMVaa	Whatever happened to confidentiality in the workplace?? Looks like it doesn't exist anymore.  IMO if you're making mistakes, they should be discussed between you and your supervisors only, in private, behind closed doors-not in front of others or in meetings. It's humiliating.    I'd have a sit-down with both supervisors and tell them nicely, but firmly that if they find you are making mistakes, to please tell you in private-and document your meeting with them. No results? Take it to HR with your documentation. Even schoolkids aren't humiliated in front of classes by teachers - why should you be?

So in staff meetings, they are giving you more attention.  They expect more of you and are feeling you out to see how you handle things.     It's also possible they are noticing the same mistakes are showing up.  If someone is taking notes at the meeting, it could be going on your performance evaluation.     Try to evaluate these mistakes.  Can you correct them yourself or will it take training or someone else to help you out.     |`|AA10469473	A good supervisor praises in public, and reprimands in private.

They are willing to put up with them being late from lunch, because their work isn't full of mistakes!  Eliminate your mistakes and they will have nothing to call you out on!|`|TiAK1629aa	You could definitely file a grievance with the union and they'll look into it.  I would go to your Human Resource department and talk to them.  Let them know what's going on, and they are obligated to at least give you some guidance on how to deal with it.  They can also pull the supervisors aside and counsel them on their lack of professionalism.  The bonus of going to HR is that it gets documented.  If it ever gets worse, then you've already got some history there to help.  Insist on having copies of everything and take them home with you.    As a side note, make sure that you "keep your nose clean".  Don't give the supervisors any reason to say that your work performance is poor or you're violating any company policies.  If there's no reason for their behavior, then it's harrassment at some point.|`|AA11900069	I give no-one any reason to criticise me in my job.  If that sounds arrogant, sorry, I am all over it.

L5sNLs01aa	You have to weigh up the various probabilities involved. How likely is it that compulsory redundancy may soon follow, perhaps with only a statutory minimum payment? How likely is it that your company will go under and you may lose your job without any notice?    Depending on your specific skill set you need to consider the possibilities on the new job front. Are there any training opportunities that would significantly increase your employment possibilities? There are so many factors that will affect your new employment prospects and only you can weigh up the ramifications of a period of unemployment or a potentially reduced income.    All things considered 10k is far more than most will get for losing a job in the current financial situation, and job losses are likely to increase generally. Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|AA11900069	I think I would take the money and run.  They may fall soon, and you could get nothing!

En effet, la caution est un contrat (=deux parties au minimum) mme si les obligations rsultant de ce contrat sont  sens unique. Il ne peut tre rsili qu'avec l'accord respectif de ceux qui l'ont sign,  savoir vos parents et le bailleur.    La mise sous tutelle de votre frre n'empchera pas le bailleur de recourir  l'encontre de vos parents.     La solution consisterait pour vos parents (mais ils vont se facher grave avec votre frre)  inviter le bailleur  faire dlivrer  votre frre un commandement de payer visant la clause rsolutoire.     Si  l'expiration d'un dlai de 2 mois suivant ce commandement, les loyers n'ont pas t honors, le bails sera rsili de plein droit.

Si le bail d'origine prvoyait que le cautionnement se prolonge autant que dure le bail, la jurisprudence requalifie le cautionnement en cautionnement  dure indtermine et dans ce cas, il suffit que la caution (tes parents) rsilie unilatralement son engagement mais les effets sont quand mme reports  la fin de la nouvelle priode de renouvellement du bail.

When presenting your credentials (on the application or during the interview) draw attention to the courses/experiences/previous training which lends itself to their requirement for you. Where you absolutely come up dry, show eagerness in your desire to learn any task required, and your confidence in your ability to succeed at that.  So often management would rather train "the right person" than take someone who apparently possesses the credentials, but gives them a "bad feeling in the gut".  Your willingness to learn and serve the company can go a long way.

Usually if you have the degree and they want like 3 years experience and you only have two they will fudge it, but to not have the right experience for either? idk. do you believe that you will get the job? i'd recommend you go talk to one of the people in charge of hiring for that spot, go in and say "hey ______, i know we have ________ position open.

That will tell you if values are still declining in that market. You don't want to buy in a declining area.    2 when you have found and intend to buy, purchase title insurance at closing. With the state of our market, be safe in the future when you go to sell. If a problem arises during your ownership, the title company will have to correct it at no cost to you.

AA11474133	I'm trying to figure out why you are really asking.  I haven't heard of an oven using 3 phase power, but i'm not familiar with large ovens.  Is it really industrial?  I'd call it commercial.    Maybe you are asking how to plug in an oven because there is 3 phase power at the building, which is common for commercial applications.  Actually, a large apartment building would typically be 3 phase.  Single phase and 3 phase loads both can be served from a 3 phase service.  So they can install normal 120V outlets, and special single phase outlets like an oven, from 3 phase.    If you look at a typical household range, it will have 2 power/voltage ratings.  For example it might be 12kW at 240V and 10kW at 208V (making up the numbers).  The 208V is a typical voltage available from a 3 phase service.  That type of 3 phase does not have 240V available.  Of course you can get other voltages from transformers, and larger buildings will do this, and the service would be a higher voltage, like 480V is a common 3 phase voltage.  208V is the common voltage for smaller 3 phase services, but there may be old installations that actually have 240V 3 phase.    For the plug itself, if you go to the link below, it will show what different plugs look like for different voltages, current ratings, 3 phase and single phase, and if it has a ground or not.  Household ranges are the 14-50P for 4 wire connections, or the 10-50P for older 3 wire connections (no ground).  Grounds in the chart are marked with a G, neutrals with a W (for white).  X, Y, and Z are hot or phase connections.    If this doesn't help you, ask a more specific question.|`|AA11312858	If you are talking about a domestic oven, you are probably asking about a three prong plug.  It works off a single phase   (normal residential) system.  240 volts between the two hot legs and a common ground neutral.  Newer ovens have four prongs, the neutral and ground are separate.  Three phase electricity is normally used in industrial and some commercial applications and utilizes three hot legs.  Hope that is helpful.|`|826c2a1882060322493c695e2fdb5af0aa	It's a type of power system... There's single phase and three phase. Three phase is generally used in heavier commercial/industrial settings, as most three-phase motors draw less amperage. Single phase is used in residential and light commercial.    A three phase plug is simply one designed to work in a three-phase powergrid.

becca6b74554ef6c2de97477686169b0aa	i hope this helps you  In recent years, India has been witnessing unprecedented growth in the real estate sector fueled by the increased business activity.    Real estate development in India is estimated at $12 billion and growing at 30% every year. Though all segments of real estate business such as corporate, retail and residential have been driving this growth, investment in residential property itself constitutes 80% of this sector.    Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are one of the key contributors to the growth of the real estate industry and considering the immense potential in India, they are likely to step-up the investment in future.    In this article, senior tax professionals with Ernst & Young -- Gaurav Taneja and Rajesh S -- provide an overview of the key exchange control and tax implications that should be considered by NRIs while investing in house property in India.    Exchange control regulations    The Indian government has considerably eased the restrictions relating to investments by NRIs in house property. There is virtually no restriction or approval required for an NRI to invest in properties in India from funds received in India through normal banking channels or held in Non-Resident External (NRE) account/ Foreign Currency Non-Resident (FCNR) account (B)/ Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) rupee account.    However, investment in agricultural land / plantation property / farm house is currently prohibited. The recurring rental income earned on letting out of property is also freely repatriable.    Sale/ Repatriation    An NRI can freely sell or gift his/ her property to another Indian resident or NRI or person of Indian origin. However, there are certain restrictions imposed on repatriation of sale proceeds.    In case of investments made from inward remittances or out of NRE account or FCNR account (B), the repatriation of sale proceeds is permitted only up to the amount of initial investment.    In case the repatriation is made out of balances held in NRO rupee account (balances include sale proceeds of house property), then an amount of $1 million per calendar year can be repatriated.    One of the significant restrictions placed on repatriation is that the NRI can repatriate the sale proceeds only up to two residential properties. This could dampen the interest of NRIs in residential property, as investors would like to have free flow of capital while making such investments.    Income tax    The income tax implications on house property income in India would be dependent on whether the property is kept vacant or let out. In case an NRI has only one property in India and if it is kept vacant, then it would be possible to say that there should not be any rental value for such property as the NRI was not able to occupy the same owing to his employment, business or professional carried out at any other place.    However, if he owns two properties and both of them are kept vacant, then he is required to pay income tax on one of the properties as if the property had been let out. The tax laws do not provide clear guidance on how the rental value is to be determined for such property.    It simply states that the annual rent should be the sum which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year. Though there are judicial precedents that are available which suggest adoption of municipal value/ fair rent, there could be some practical difficulties in ascertaining such value in the ever increasing rental market.    In case of let out properties, the actual rental income (after reducing the municipal taxes) would be subject to tax. The tax law allows a general deduction of 30% on the rental income and also allows for deduction towards interest subject to certain conditions.    Tax payments    Under Indian tax law, the payer is required to withhold tax on rental income paid to a non-resident @ 30.6% where the income of the non-resident does not exceed Rs 10,00,000, otherwise at 33.66%.    In case an NRI wishes to have a lower rate, then he has to apply to the tax authorities in a specified format for obtaining a certificate for deduction of tax at lower rate. The NRI would be required to file a return of income at the end of the year if the taxable income exceeds Rs 100,000.    In case the NRI is taxed in the home country on the rental income derived from India, then he could consider claiming exemption or tax credit in the home country based on the double tax treaty agreement entered into India with such country, if any.    Other aspects    It is common practice to have joint ownership of properties by a husband and wife. However in case an individual intends to split the income between himself and his wife for tax purposes, then it is important to establish that both of them contributed for the investment in property and the share of ownership is clearly outlined.    In case the entire investment is made by one person, then in all likelihood, the entire income would be taxable in that individual's hands on account of the clubbing provisions that exist in India though the property may be jointly held.    Wealth tax    Tax implications are not restricted only to income tax and NRIs have to keep in mind the wealth tax implications as well.    Wealth tax is levied on the value of specified assets in excess of Rs 15,00,000. Specified assets include house property. However, the Wealth Tax Act provides an exemption in respect of one house property. In case of more than one property, the NRI would have to pay wealth tax @ 1% on the value (value determined based on the prescribed valuation rules) in excess of Rs 15,00,000 and file the required return.    There is a specific exemption available for returning Indians in respect of investment made in hou|`|5080fef6add56abed9e3c16b62ebf1a5aa	There are certain areas requiring prior approval from the Government.

While conventional wisdom teaches us to learn skills, and enhance our knowledge for the job, we often forget that we need to keep coming up with new ideas that will help the organisation succeed and also keep our jobs secure in today's competitive landscape. We offer a few tips towards helping you break out of a routine thought process and generate breakthrough ideas.  Your first step into the corporate world?  Exercise your mind  Your mind, like your body, needs exercise and can get it through challenges and problem-solving. A good way to feed your mind is to read a lot and study the success stories of other businesses and entrepreneurs.   Read case studies related to your industry or biographies of successful people.   This will not only stimulate your grey cells but also provide you a dose of inspiration. Learn how other successful people generate breakthrough ideas.  Capture your thoughts  When the brilliant spells do come, make sure you capture them. Don't rely on mental notes, you'll surely forget them. Have a notepad, PDA or voice recorder ready at all times, even next to your bed at night (who knows, you may suddenly strike gold at 2 am). Once you've recorded your idea, use it as soon as you can. I read an advertisement for IT company Accenture, which said:  "An idea is like a cup of coffee, it's not going to stay hot forever." So remember that ideas are best when they're fresh.  "I always carry a voice recorder with me and tape my thoughts. Listening to them later  in the day ensures that I don't deprive myself of the brilliant phases that we all have during the day," says G Rajaraman, a senior sports correspondent with Outlook magazine.|`|83mQnhdZaa	speak as u wish and as in ur heart. be fearles|`|b4e4c15241da01e06024484535e0dd5eaa	do work hard and carefully. do be overconfidence.|`|3b90335d7586cef7bdc3648304691524aa	Hard Work and Honesty

XDSphbCeaa	100k per year is really good. 100k is well over the national avg salary of about 37k.     It's true that your lifestyle, spending habits and the cost of living in your state play a part in how well you live on 100k. But with that said, someone who is good at managing money could live well on 1/2 that income no matter the cost of living. I live in the DC Metro area which is one the most expensive areas in the country to live and I do very well on 55k. On the other hand, someone making a 100k could be in over their heads in debt and living paycheck to paycheck.     Bottom line: No matter how much you make you can still wind up broke if you don't manage your finances.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	All depends.  If you live in New York City it barely covers the cost of living.

hytS9gNzaa	PayPal is an e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. PayPal serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods such as checks and money orders.  A PayPal account can be funded with an electronic debit from a bank account or by a credit card. The recipient of a PayPal transfer can either request a check from PayPal, establish their own PayPal deposit account or request a transfer to their bank account. PayPal is an example of a payment intermediary service that facilitates worldwide e-commerce.|`|n170Qkrcaa	i dunno|`|nPt7hUE8aa	You sign up for an account. You add your credit/debit information or checking information so they can verify you, then they remove the limitations of how much money you can send or receive. If you are paying with something thru paypal, you will chose your method of payment and they will charge whatever account you specify. You can also send invoices to receive money. Then you can withdrawal the money from your paypal account to your checking account.|`|DTlrp5Ueaa	You sign up and link a bank account or credit card to it.    You can transfer money to your paypal account to buy things safely using paypal. Or if you don't put any money in paypal will fall back on your credit card if you allow it to to get the funds needed for a purchase made.    If you receive money from someone paying you through Ebay or whatever you can then have paypal send the money to your bank account, send you a paypal debit card, or you can simply leave it in the paypal account and use it for purchases.    Put simply: paypal is like a bank account but it's safer to use over the internet because your personal information is not given out and your funds won't be abused.    Hope this helps!|`|7ES4xMloaa	you enter credit  card and bank info and it withdrawls from one when you buy something. its really easy and doesnt take long
H17L1WW4aa	Actually a FHA loan of 3% down has a cheaper rate then a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac at 99% down.    FHA has the cheapest rates.    Pros, low down payment, easiest qualifications, assumable loan (if they qualify), ability to streamline (no credit or income required).    Cons, Upfront mortgage insurance (since you dont have 20% its moot)....  Thats my only con.    FHA are great loans if you find a loan officer that knows how to do them, and do them well.  They are much cheaper and much easier to do then any conventional loan.  They are great loans with lots of pluses.      I would say literally 70% of all loans I do are FHA.    And remember their rates are always cheaper then Conventional regardless of down payment.  As per your FICO score.  Not that much, I close a FHA loan with somebody with a 805 FICO and got a person approved at 545 FICO.  They both got the same rate.    With FHA you are approved or you arent.  If you are at 560 you get the same pricing as those at 820.  But some lenders wont take it below 620, but for the most part its the same rate.    But ive heard of lenders saying because you are 660 it will cost you 2% to get this loan.  Thats a lie.  The rate is the same give or take a couple hundred dollars.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	I haven't heard of FHA needing two appraisals.  Any loan program, if the value is in question, the underwriter may order what is called a "property review" which is a mini-appraisal that is done to simply confirm what the first appraiser did.    It is not unique to FHA.    FHA will require you to escrow the loan and is at a slightly higher rate....FHA loans have a flat rate...if you qualify for an FHA loan, even though you have a high credit score, it won't make any difference in the rate.    You'll also have to pay a funding fee for the MIP...but part of that is refundable when you go to sell the house.    Some folks will post that an inspection is required...but it is NOT.  They are confusing it with the old VC sheets that used to be included with an appraisal (but it was never an inspection) that FHA hasn't used in about 3 years now.    However, always get a termite report and inspection...on your own.  Get someone independently, DO NOT get someone the Realtor or the bank recommends.  Make sure they are licensed residential home inspector and will give you a full report.    That's pretty much it.  FHA doesn't work much differently than any other loan.|`|jgq7Tsuuaa	Don't know about the interest rate, but those are super scores.    I know that on some FHA loans they are now requiring two appraisals and that can add up to $600 to $800 or more depending on several factors involved in the appraisal process.    I think the second appraisal can be a drive-by appraisal, but from what I understand it cannot be a Broker Price Opinion (BPO) though, but if they do allow a drive-by, sometimes appraisers will do those for $100 or so less than a full appraisal.

BXwv4dBvaa	If you bank at TD, their online site where you can make trades (discount brokerage) is TD-Waterhouse.    Basically, you can set up either a cash account that you would transfer money to and buy financial instruments through there (stocks, bonds, mutuals, etc.), or you could set up a margin account, where you borrow money to buy stocks.    Each trade (purchase and sale) will cost you a fee.  The fee depends on the number of trades that you are making, and/or the amounts that you are spending.  I noticed on the TD-Waterhouse site that they advertise "as low as $7.00 a trade"; but this would be for a high number of trades and/or large amounts of cash moving in and out.    When you sign up for this type of service, you can also subscribe to research provided by analysts to help you make your investment choices.    See the link below to the TD-Waterhouse site, which has lots of other information about how you go about using a discount brokerage.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	If your bank has a brokerage, yes, you can buy shares of stock through them.

glynFK9haa	Network through exco-workers.|`|7bf74d32e94d2654d289c709b1b924c8aa	Been there, done that.  First, I would suggest PRAY!  Because unfortunately, you are not alone.  And also, using the internet to search for a job.  It really is the fastest way.  Of course networking is great.  And, I suggest constantly looking.  Pull out your blue suit or go invest in one.  Get your resume done and go to job fairs.  Jobstar.org has good resume templates.  And your local library has a computer you can use.  Careerbuilder.com is a good site.  Also, Indeed.com     Also, you may not get the exact job you want right away, but, wear a paper hat and occupy your time working somewhere for now.  Anywhere.  Even Wal-Mart or McDonald's.  Work the night shift if you have too.  It beats not being broke.  Just don't sit idly.  If working is not an option, then try school.  Any type of schooling is helpful.  Even a certificate of some sort.  And, don't be picky about having to work a job close to home.  Sometimes you have better options for a job, if you are willing to travel a little further.  I wish you the best of luck, times are hard!  I was previously out of work for a year and my husband lost his job a year ago as well.  But, I have been working for the past 6 months.  My husband just started a job 2 days ago.  I'll keep you in my prayers!|`|2H4QOwFzaa	Start looking, do not compare yourself to other people.    Some years ago I was unemployed, and I had mailed out many copies of my resume with no luck. I went to an employment agencies and took the tests.  Waited around for an hour for them to tell me that they did not have anything that would meet my needs.    I decided that I was going to find a job on my own.  I looked in the newspaper and I saw an ad where they were looking for ten people to work in the warehouse.  I figured that they would need more help in the front office.  I went and filled out an application, and the personnel person said  that they would be giving a written test at 2:00 pm. because so many people answered the ad.    I went back at 2:00 pm and there was  about forty people waiting, and I said OH well, I have more time than money. Ten minutes later a man came and said would xx please go to the personnel office. I have a very common name, and at first I did not stand up, because I thought that he was referring to someone else.    I went to the personnel office and the lady said that they needed more help in the office, and they were going to put an ad in the newspaper that weekend. I went back the next day for the interview and I got hired to work in the accounting department as her assistant.     The company was only fifteen minutes from my house, and the starting salary was the same as my last job.|`|e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	Assuming this just happened to you, I'm sorry. It can be devastating. The best advice I can give you is not to let it be!    The way you react immediately sets the stage for everything that follows. If you are like me, your first impulse will be to go home and go to bed -- for a few months at least. That is the worst thing you can do.    Immediately set a precedent of constructive activities. I have a friend who carried it to this extreme... The day after getting laid off, he got up at 6am and put on a suit and tie and started making a list of people to call. He had a job a week later.    Having said all that, I also want to suggest the opposite. Be really nice to yourself. You've been through something devastating. The worst thing you can do is beat yourself up.    Ideally you can combine these two things... be constructive ~and~ cut yourself some slack. Good luck!
Pe1zUHlyaa	I have the Citibank DIVIDENDS card and bought it as the first credit card for me. I had a debit card for 5 years and never had overdraft or anything, so I applied without any past credit history for the Citibank one, and it's a real great program. I was approved and had my card within a week. Good APR, only about 13%, but if you pay off the balance every month you don't have to pay that you know?    First 6 months you get 5% on all purchases at gas stations, plus 2% on everything else as cashback. After 6 months it goes to 2% on gas, 1% on everything else.     Added bonus is you can get the cashback either taken off your balance or mailed to you as a check! I really recommend this one. They have great customer service. Respond to emails in about 2 hrs max, and I have never had a problem when I called their customer service line.

8xMhLMoRaa	I've never heard anything about withholding the wages for two days if you've been fired. How many times have your friends been fired to even know that this is possible?? This may be something to do with the appeal, but you should be contacting them or payroll to ask what is going on. Since you are appealing your dismissal, it's not like you can claim Jobseeker's Allowance, so what are they expecting you to live on? You have worked for that money so you should recieve it, regardless of the circumstances of your leaving. It might be an idea if you edit your question to say why you were fired since this may have something to do with the withholding of your wages. Such as if you stole from the company (or were suspected of doing so should I say!), they are holding back your money because they want to recoup what they see as their losses. Good luck!|`|nG63KSMgaa	If you're appealing then you're not technically fired yet, you're suspended on full pay I got fired recently from a job I;d been in for 8 years.

If you want to sell when the stock drop to a price $X, then it will be a stop order of $X.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	asking price|`|ww12lItvaa	All of the above. They are all limit orders and used differently to sell under different conditions. And you didn't tell us the conditions so we can't tell you.     Like a stop loss is a limit order you put in to sell if the price falls.     A limit order would be simply the price you would like to sell if it rises to that price. (also used to buy at a specific price under a current price). Likely the answer you want.     A trailing stop is not really an order. It is a stop loss order but you raise it as the price rises to generally keep it a certain amount below the current price, like  a certain dollar amount or percentage under. That is way to lock in the gains as the stock is going up, in case it heads back down, but without selling now.

The IRS WMR site says that they already deposited funds into my account. i haven't seen anything, does this always happen? and whats the point of saying that it will be DD on a certain date and then it doesn't get DD, it's just causing unnecessary stress to people, IRS says if I haven't received my funds by the 11th to give them a call.

Contrary to what another poster states, there nothing to amend if your return has not been accepted yet.

U7nj9Kg4aa	1.  None...never went to university/college  (a degree is not required...only liscenses to sell various products.)  I am in the process of starting my Certified Financial Planning certification though.  2.  I love the fact that I can make a living by helping my friends and family become wealthy.  It's very rewarding to see a persons face when you hand them a 6-7 figure cheque during an extremely difficult time...doesn't change what happened, but makes it easier to deal with when the financial burdens are gone.  3.  Life and health (medical, dental, disbility, critical Illness, long term care, etc)  4.  I strictly work on a personal referal and recommendation basis.  5.  My lisenses renew on an annual basis.  I also need to take a certain number of "continuing education" classes a year to keep my lisensing.  See  1 for certifications thing...  6.  Daily tasks depend on the day.  I schedule my week so that I have focus days (all day I do nothing but meet with people...) and buffer days (basically, paperwork and such).  7.  Becuase I schedule myself into focus days and buffer days I typically work 3  10 hour days a week for focus days and 1-2 5 hour days for buffer days.  Hours of each day depend on the day...tends to be a fair amount of evenings work since many clients work during the day.  8.  Oddly enough, I didn't...I wanted to get into investments and my advisor said in order to be a good financial advisor you need to have some knowledge in both, so I started in insurance and kept going with it.  See  2 as well.  9.  Depends on the month...some months are busier than others and depends on whether it's investments or insurance sales.  10.  It hasn't at all.  Death and serious illness doesn't care if the economy is bad, it will still hit you anyways whether you can afford it or not.  Infact, business for me has been better with the poor economy.  If life is great and you've got $100,000 in investments and you need to stroke a cheque for $50,000 for a major surgery or something you aren't hurting.  If life isn't so great and you're stressed that you might lose your job it can cause illness.  If your investment portfolio is now only worth $40,000 and you need to stroke a cheque for $50,000, you're in trouble.  Insurance covers that for you though.
FYeHClm9aa	1.  I am licensed in life, health. accident, property and casualty insurance.  I do not have a college degree, but I am state certified.  2.  I enjoy meeting people from all walks of life.  It really is not that boring.  3.  I work mostly with life insurance.  4.  I use a lead system in which people have expressed an interest in buying insurance.  5.  I am licensed by the state that I live in and in some other states also.  You are required to do continuing education to maintain your license in the state I live in.  6.  I spend alot of time on the phone calling people and gathering info from them to determine what kind of insurance best suits them.  I also have to know alot about health issues because it can affect their rates and whether they can qualify.  You have to be meticulous in record keeping, also.  Some filing and some computer work,  but mostly phones.  7.  I work long hours, but I get to work from home.  Sometimes 9 am to 8pm.  8.  I wanted to work in the health industry, but I can't stand blood so insurance was a good option for me.  9.  Varies, but usually around $25,000.  Of course I don't get all that money....  10.  It has been hard because people are just trying to afford the necessary things and they feel that life insurance isn't that important.  I am still getting by though.  I feel lucky to have a job in this economy.    My name is Jessica and I am an independent contractor.  I work with many different insurance companies.

12VQ4ETcaa	Go to your bank and get a "secured credit card."  You put down some money as a deposit, and then start using it like a normal credit card.  After a while, the bank will trust you with an unsecured card - but be careful!    You can also go to a department store and buy a large item, like a bed or a refrigerator, and get it financed.  The best idea is to save the money first, and then just send payments every month until it's paid off.|`|C3LiKhm8aa	1.  Put some money in a bank savings account.  Let it stay for a month.    Go to the bank and ask for a loan of the amount you have in the bank for a term of 6 months.  Put the loan amount in the bank account.    Make the payments on the loan by paying from the account.    When the loan is paid off, you will have a history of taking and repaying a loan.    2.  Get a credit card with a low limit.  Use the card once a month for a small amount and pay it off immediately when the bill comes.  A good strategy is to reserve the amount of each charge in cash in a drawer, then deposit it in the bank when you write the check for the credit card payment.    After a year, you will have a history of having a credit card and making timely payments.    These won't work magic, but they are first steps.    At the same time, make sure you are current on all your other payments, such as utilities, car, telephone, etc.|`|wADsOOILaa	First, work on your banking relationship.  Do some of your banking in person.  Get to know the branch manager.  Do not ever let your account overdraft.  Show your maturity.  Build up a savings account.    Then go in and ask for a major credit card (Visa or Mastercard).  Get one that is free.  All you need is a $300 or $500 limit.  They can help you get one if they know you are a good customer and responsible.  When it arrives, use it once or twice, always paying the bill in full.  You don't need to use it often.    That will be your ticket to a good credit rating.  Don't open more cards or accounts unless there is a good reason.  Take it slow and easy.  The goal is to be solvent with a good credit rating and no outstanding balance on credit cards.    If you decide to buy a car and need a loan, go to your bank (or credit union) first.  Find out there terms before you go shopping.  Then you can choose the best financing package to use when you find the vehicle you want and can afford.    Good luck!|`|fqycKwuQaa	there are two ways you could start credit one or them is taking out a small personal loan which you might need a parent or an adult to co-sign for you meaning if you do not pay the loan they will. Or you could apply for a credit card for bad or no credit which most likely will get you approved no matter what, but if you are a student you could get a student credit card which will offer you lower rates and no annual fees, check out www.fastcreditcardapprovals.com and go under bad or no credit or student cards. good luck|`|JsDID6gJaa	Pay your bills on time|`|3AVHxNNTaa	dont miss payments, dont overcharge, don't write bad checks

AA11357056	If you can afford to forego the tax break right now, I'd say a Roth IRA... you can withdraw your contributions without penalty (as opposed to a 10% early withdrawal penalty from a traditional IRA), and if you think tax rates will be higher in future, then you're withdrawing the money tax free at that time|`|tdQTZPI7aa	High income earners do not qualify for a Roth. So it all depends on your earning ability|`|AA10491661	roth|`|ZKLwVNahaa	People that blindly say Roth arent correct, traditional may be better for you.  You should probably talk to a finance advisor to find out what would work best for you. The short end of it is that you have to look at the income bracket that you are in now, vs. which bracket you will probably be when you retire.  Most experts say that its inevitable that taxes will just go up in the future so depending on when you will actually be retiring a roth may be better for you.      Another argument for the Traditional is that since you dont pay taxes on the funds now, you may be able to invest more than you would with a roth and depending on the rate of return it may even work out better for you.  You should really consult an expert though to find out what would work the best for you.

DorePwVOaa	I have a savings account with Etrade - they do have a good rate, but it's not the best ever. The reason that it's higher than most banks is because they don't have to worry about physical stores (paying for electricity, employees, security, rent...), so they pass those savings on to you in the form of higher interest. This is true of all online banks, though - Etrade, ING Direct, Emigrant Direct, HSBC's online savings...    But yes, I would say that it is safe, and it is a good rate.|`|7oh1Qy9Gaa	Maybe has a good interest rate but in terms of buying stock its not the most affordable. After your first month it will cost you $9-$13 per trade, when you can get it at $4.50 a trade on zecco.com.

So you can buy low, forget about them, and sell high later whenever your ready as their aren't any maintenance fees. Other sites also require a large deposit that has to be wired from your bank account.  With Scottrade there are many local branches that you can sit down with a person open an account and drop off a check (min $500) making it alot safer. And if their are any problems their just a 10min drive away.  And forget about e-trades $10+ per trade. At Scott's $7 bucks a trade is solid.  Don't wanna pay $7 use this code when opening account...

SCxCAufxaa	For me, this is an easy answer as we receive resumes daily from people looking to work for our securty firm.  I would strongly urge you not to try and fill up your resume with your love for pool.  It will have little or no relevance for any engineering position you are seeking, unless you are being asked to design a new pool hall.

You can apply for a CNA job but you won't make as much money as a MA. A Certified Nursing Assistant does bed changing, and helping take the patient to the bathroom, and feeding them, some charting, and basically not as much as a MA. An MA can do blood draws and injections and room patients to take their blood pressure etc. So an MA would get paid more. They are one step higher then a CNA. Good Luck

05bV2GuFaa	The way those electrical companies works is that they don't read the meters every months. They usually bill what is close to the last reading (I got burned once for the warehouse space I was renting). For example, like if the person before you only use $100 a month, then they will bill you $100 until they come out to do the reading. Then you have to pay the big difference between the usage. What you need to do is to make sure they give you the bill on actual reading or you should go read the meter yourself and to see how much they charge you for wattage. Then to see how accurate they are.  Also, some of the smaller companies uses the same power lines, sometimes they only bill you for a portion of it, not the whole, you will end up with paying two bills.

One exception that I know of is that CT requires that you file a tax return if you had withholding regardless of your income.    As with all tax issues, consult an expert in your area.
jgq7Tsuuaa	As far as the investment goes, as long as the rents will cover all your costs now and for the foreseeable future, then that would be your answer to whether it is a secure investment or not.    You could use realtor.com and see if the listings say if the properties are Bank or Investor Owned (REO) properties and I would think if you did a search on google you quite possibly could find something there too.    Another thing about the investing part. Where you live can have a huge impact as to the secure investment part too, as you didn't say where you were from!    Larry|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Nothing online.

kZRTekoJaa	I quit working when my son was 9 months old and have been trying to find a work at home job ever since. :)  I have actually found a lot of paid survey sites that are legitimate and do pay, however it takes a lot of time and the pay is very very small.  I also know from experience that the HUD refund processors/third party tracers is a legitimate job. you can even go to the HUD website and see for yourself that it is legitimate. the biggest downside, however is that most people will verify your legitimacy before sending you money and when they go to verify they will find out they can get their refund for free with no outside help. but there is potential.  between the scams and the people who aren't actually willing to do any work and then will say a company is a scam, it is hard to know which companies are legitimate and you can only trust a stranger's opinion for so much. i would recommend trying out GDI's work at home program. it's affiliate marketing. there is a 7 day free trial, so you can see for yourself the earning potential. After that it only costs $10 a month. if you're serious about working from home, then it's definitely worth a risk free try to make sure you're not passing up a good earning opportunity. and you can learn more about it here: http://website.ws/rbuckley85|`|raqQPkwyaa	There are but you need to be cautious before signing up and research them well. You can make money on line but the question is how hard do you want to work at it. The safest way not to get scammed would be do create your own work from home business. People do this everyday by building their own websites about a passion or hobby and then adding affiliate sales, google ads, and other forms of passive income . It all boils down to multiple streams of income. But first you have to identify what your site will be about and have a blue print to follow. Once you know the process you will get free targeted traffic through the search engines. The internet is about information, information, information. Deliver free useful information, warm up your visitors to your monetization model, presell them by being unbiased and then you will make sales and money. This is a process so don't expect to get rich quick. In time with some brains and motivation you will own a nice little corner of the internet and have more freedom to do the things you love. For starters it will require work for little or no pay. The payday will come in time with patience and keyword focused content pages on your site. First you need to find a good site builder that is wysiwyg. Unless you are good at HTML, etc. When looking for a site builder be sure to research it as well. What kind of support system do they have? What tools are available and do they cost extra money to have the tools etc.? Next you will brainstorm a site blue print. A good site builder will have this tool available. The blue print will basically be profitable keywords for your pages that are non generic. Profitable keywords are ones that are high in demand and low in supply. Then you build keyword focused content pages about your sites theme. Giving away free information. The beginning is all about building credibility and visitors. Your keyword focused content pages will get you free targeted traffic through the search engines. Once your site is building in size you can start to presell your monetization model and finally monetize. There really is no such thing as get rich quick so be patient and focused.

1UpR1vSCaa	http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  PLEASE ANSWER MY TAX QUESTION|`|tdQTZPI7aa	The change in dates is due to the overload. Normal time is 3 weeks|`|AA11284831	The IRS can't tell you anything until your refund is at least one week late based upon the most recent date shown on the Where's My Refund tool on their website.      Let me repeat that in case you didn't read it:  The IRS can't tell you anything until your refund is at least one week late based upon the most recent date shown on the Where's My Refund tool on their website.      Since calling the IRS can't do anything for you until your refund is at least one week late, don't waste your time (or theirs!) by pestering them.    The date is being changed because the processing of your tax return has been delayed.  There are dozens of possible reasons for that so speculating on what might have caused yours be be delayed is an exercise in futility.  An experienced tax pro MIGHT be able to look at your tax return and figure out the likely cause but it's probably not worth a $50 to $100 consultation fee for that.  And it wouldn't give you any information that you could use to expedite anything so it would be money down the toilet anyway.|`|rdaFNCGRaa	It usually goes based on your last name and I also agree with the other answer, it is also due to overload.

It's too dangerous right now to risk being out of money completely and a lot of people are losing their jobs and would welcome the lower paying job at this point. So I say keep the lower paying job, but keep looking for your better paying job. Someday, when you find it, then you can leave the lower paying job for your happy job and a good income (instead of to face a very uncertain future).|`|d3KXmsDgaa	It's hard to answer this question without knowing your profession or your financial situation.  However, the question is not whether you should quit your low paying job but whether you can AFFORD to quit your low paying job.    Here are some things to consider before making your decision:  - How much money do you have in your rainy day fund?  Do you have enough money to survive for 6 months without going into debt?    - Is your profession a generalist that has opportunities across industries or a specialist that is limited to certain types of positions?  A generalist will have more competitors (and you can stand out if you're good at interviews) while a specialist will have less opportunities (but your experience will put you over).    - Was your salary at the previous job commensurate to industry averages or was it higher than average?  You should expect a drop in pay for the same position if you were in the higher band.    Suggestion:  Right now is probably not a good time to be looking for the perfect position or letting your pride getting in the way of good common sense.  My suggestion is to stay at this job and look for a better job 3 months down the road.      Just Be!

Right now,  the market is low.  CW doesn't mind waiting a bit to see if the value of the house is higher than what you think it is.  Do bear in mind that Congress is bandying about an assortment of programs to aid the housing industry.  If and when those programs are passed and kick in, houses may start to move more rapidly, and that would help raise CW's accepted sale price.
jyDmUbYzaa	Hello,  On line competitions are quite common and mostly quite easy to enter. At its simplest you will have to provide an answer that is actually provided in the material (ie the provider wants you to read the blurb they are advertising). If the answer is not immediately clear it can usually be found with a simple Google search. To assist there are a number of free online sites that gather together all the available competitions (comps) and sometimes other users provide answers. So this is a great way to try to make money with little investment (except your time).    The rewards vary and, of course, are random. Some give away lots of small prizes (free suncream etc) that are trivial but save you money. There is the potential to sometimes win cash, holidays, film tickets etc. In the main the competitions that offer significant prizes also expect you to do some more work but most are still free. As a general rule, try to avoid those competitions where you need to submit the answer using text or a phone call to an expensive number. This will cost you money (though of course it might also reduce the number of competing entries).    In summary, consider doing online competitions as a great simple way to make money with little investment. The returns are variable but over time people do win reasonable amounts for no investment except their time.|`|0Ymq0FRcaa	this is helpful to you!    http://www.earnsimply.com|`|Y2y6JNepaa	If you're looking to make some cash online, I reccomend doing Get Paid To.

U7nj9Kg4aa	Sorry to hear about your fathers situation.  Tell him to fight it as hard as he can!  My father had cancer a few years ago at age 59 and had no insurance and little savings at the time, so I know what you must be going through (going through that made me want to help prevent others from the same thing happening which is why I got into the life and health insurance business).    Gauranteed Issue (no medical questions) is you're only option and as mentioned if he passes away wihtin 2 years typically those policies don't pay out.  These policies are also very expensive.    The only other options would be to start a savings account or contact a funeral home and start pre-paying the funeral costs.    Insurance is something that you never use until you need it and if you don't have it when you need it you can't buy it at any cost.  this is why it's important to be realistic about planning things financially and realize that someday we will pass away or become seriously ill and there is a financial cost to it that you or someone you love will be on the hook for.|`|hWc65sEtaa	Unfortunately most insurances won't cover him with that kind of diagnose.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Not likely.

vCePK8gMaa	The porch is definitely the landlords, since he owns the property. It will never be yours unless you purchase the house.    If the porch is accessible only through your apartment, then it you rent that space. You have the right to use it, but cannot use it for a living space or modify it in any way.    If the porch is accessible via a common hallway, which other tenants can enter, then it is common area and it is not included with the rent unless your lease states otherwise.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Read your lease - it should specify whether the porch is part of your premises or if it is a common area.

Either you have to be listed on her policy, OR, you have to be excluded as an operator on her policy - and a lot of companies won't do this, because, we all KNOW you're going to be driving - you wouldn't have a LICENSE if you weren't driving.      Or you can turn in your license, so you're not licensed to drive.     The insurance companies can pull a record, of all the licensed people at your house, so calling another insurance company and getting new insurance, and not telling them about you, well, first of all, it's probably not going to work, and second, it's FRAUD, and will cause you to flat out not be covered.  OR her car, if you're driving it.|`|uU22GER7aa	For a mistake like this, she needs to go to there office and DEMAND they take you off explaining to them that you being added was there fault.

She had to cancel with that company all together and find a new one.|`|dRezbY31aa	All household members having a license must be added to the policy even if they don't have a car or will be driving. There have been too many cases of a teen "stealing" the car keys and getting into an accident. Yes, they will be liable if you drive your friends cars or the family cars so you must pay. If the lady didn't add you she'd likely get reprimanded or fired. The only way to get dropped from the policy is to move out of the house. If you do as has been suggested and change insurance companies and not add you your family could loose everything in a lawsuit. In my opinion the $960 per year is a lot better than having your wages garnished for the rest of your life. I knew of one kid in my state which did the same thing, had an accident, and is paying 30% of his wages for the rest of his life.|`|f43ec9175e6ff594263397529d524231aa	It depends on the insurance provider and what state you live in.  Some states and insurance providers require all minors with their licence in the household be insured.  If that is the case then you are stuck unless you move to a state that doesn't have that requirement or your mom switches to a company that doesn't.  I would recomend your mother call her agent rather than customer service to get this straightened out.  More likely than not her agent will be more accomodating.  If that doesn't work and if you don't have a job you could always get a job and give your mom the money to help make up the difference.  I realize that probably isn't your idea of a good answer but it would solve the problem and it is a nice gesture.

The IRS initiates deposits on Wednesdays & Thursdays.  The tell the bank they are not allowed to post the deposit before Friday.  That is not the bank "holding" your deposit...that is them adhering to the rules set forth by the IRS.  Your employer does this too...they send the deposit 2 days (or so) before it posts.     By law your bank cannot hold an IRS direct deposit past the post date...so if the IRS has given your bank a post date of 2/6 your bank must put it in your bank account on 2/6.  It is also true that your bank may not apply Reg CC rules to an IRS tax refund check (this rule does not apply to rapid refund or refund anticipation loans).

The school(s) are merely covering themselves legally.  If cops are called I would tell them exactly what you just wrote.  You were the one in fact assaulted.

gYNMCJRLaa	I've dealt with a lot of job agencies. When you see a job listing posted by the agency, you send them your resume, and if they are interested in hiring you, they will call you for an interview. On a side note, this isn't the only way to do it. You can look up job agencies in your area and call to schedule and interview with them.  At the interview, they usually have you take some computerized tests (what tests you take depend on the job you're applying for). Then they give you a basic interview. If you are hired, then you are an employee of the job agency, not the client. The agency is only "lending you out" to the client.   Some agencies might have you go interview with their client, and others will just hire you without sending you to the client. It just depends on the company.  As for being obligated to stay with the company, I've never heard of that before. You're an employee, and like any employee, you are free to come and go as you please.  I hope this helps you...and hope you get a good job. :)    ~Dahl~|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Agencies will post jobs just to get you in the door.  They are paid by commission.  They go out and solicit employers to list their job openings with them.  The agency will test and do a possible interview with you.  If you meet the requirements, they will send you to the company.  The company pays the agency to during your probation period in some cases. If the company hires you on a permanent bases, they will tell the agency you are hired and your contract with the agency ends.  You are then on the company's payroll.   Yes, sometime it is better to find a job on your own. It wouldn't hurt to find an agency with a good track record in finding a job for someone and work to find one on your own.  Do not pay the agency to find you a job!|`|rDsKB0uXaa	look around where you live.    good luck    the economy is terrible|`|todVA7CGaa	hi all kind of jobs are here   http://youronlinejobs.com
TlVDtUuZaa	The typical belief that union dues reduce your income is simply not true. In reality, union workers on average make 30% more than their non-union counterparts. Typical union dues are around 1.5% of wages. Most of us can do the calculation: 30% - 1.5% = 28.5% increase.    Also, union workers are protected by contract. The employer does not set the rules, wages, benefits, etc, arbitrarily, but rather must negotaite with workers who are elected by the employees to represent the group.    It is not true that a union can "take you out on strike." Strikes are always a last resort and only happen when a majority of the members at a facility vote to go out on strike. Some contacts require a super majority of 66% or even 75% before a strike can be authorized. I have worked at a union facility for that has been open for a little over 50 years and there has never been a strike in the history of the plant.    The only real con of a union (which it is debatable whether it really is a con) is that in most cases, advancement is based on seniority (length of service). However, while it can be argued that this prevents the hard workers from advances due to their preformance, it also eliminates advancement due to brown nosing (which unfortunately goes on in union shops as well.)    If you want to know the truth about unions, I suggest a visit to www.aflcio.com There is a site out there called unionfacts.com, but the title is misleading. It would be more appropriately called union-half-truths.com Check the sources of information on both sites for their credibility in informational use.    If you have further questions, feel free to send me an e-mail.    Also, one last thing. I was extremely anti-union until I found out what unions really did for their members instead of listening to all the rhetoric. Ponder this one question....if unions really could not benefit you, why do companies fight them so hard? Do companies care if you pay dues to health clubs, car clubs, the NRA, any other organization?     Bottomline, the company wants the ultimate say in what the rules are. With a union, the workers have a say in setting the rules as well.     And remember, the United States is a UNION!|`|fShlKEfYaa	Pro - labor unions unite the workers and negotiate the salary and benefits for union members  If you are being treated unfairly and the company is not following the union agreement, then the union respresentative will fight for your cause  Conditions are safer for employees, and the company provides training  The union will let you know your union member worker rights, if you are not sure then your union representative will provide answers  Con - Union dues reduce take-home pay, members must honor strikes and do picket duty going without pay, sometimes the length of time out on strike without pay does not equal the increase and you never make up the pay lost on a strike.

T7N3Iy9Uaa	No, the contstitution doesn't explicitly state that taxes are to be collected by the IRS. It's important to bear in mind how the IRS would be given its power to perform its operations, which principally consists of collecting taxes. Congress is empowered to create laws that help in the administration of Congress' express and limited powers as defined in section I of the constitution. Without further consideration, this power of congress would prima facie classify the IRS as a legal entity as it was created by an act of congress in 1913 and is conducive to carrying out one of Congress' express powers, to lay and collect taxes (see Art. I, Sct. 8 of the U.S. Constitution). However, this is not the case and the method by which the United States citizens' incomes are taxed is illegal according to the constitution.The IRS is inherently a legal body due to its congressional creation; however, in its manner of collecting taxes it has contradicted our fundamental law.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	The constitution does not effect government departments at all, the IRS is simply the record keepers for our internal revenue.|`|20LnuCejaa	Yes|`|KpcjvUgwaa	No. Anyone who says otherwise has not studied this issue.    ....nor was the act of paying taxes ever actually ratified into the constitution.    It operates based on on legal presidents...basically the fact that people pay taxes and it is a socially accepted process.
6LPeWXYuaa	As noted by the other poster, the seller is not obligated to negotiate with the first offer received, send back multiple offers for "Highest & Best", or even accept a full price offer.    Typically, if multiple offers are received, it is usually in the Seller's best interests to send all offers back for "Highest & Best", but not required.  It is possible that your agent was told by the listing agent that this is what would happen, but when the 2nd offer was received the Seller was SOOOO happy with it, it was accepted on the spot.    You don't have legal recourse that I know of in this instance.  There are plenty of properties for sale, I'll bet you find as good or better around the next corner. :)    Good luck.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	There is no legal basis for your complaint.  Sellers are not required to make provisions for all interested parties to make an offer.  If the sellers were very happy with the offer presented, they have every right to accept it right on the spot.    Had YOU made an offer, it might be you who had the accepted offer.

shn4eCXcaa	The underwriter verifies that the appraiser correctly followed guidelines, supported his/her value on the home correctly, and did not omit anything on the form.  (we read the form so the credit officer doesn't have to and can concentrate on your financing)    How long it takes depends on who you go through.  Normally we have same day turnaround.  But because of the unprecedented exposion of refinancing applications my company is currently about a month behind.  This hasn't happened in 10-30 years?  Sorry =(|`|H17L1WW4aa	Depends on if your broker or lender actually ran the DU or LP themselves.    I can only say what we do, we get it approved before it hits the underwriter.  This is with DU and LP.  It will give us all conditions and we scan and upload them to the underwriter.  When the underwriter looks at it, the underwriter might have 20 conditions she needs to check.    To give an example I had 3 come up for underwriting today.  Today at noon the first underwriter looked at the first file.  She cleared all the conditions (nothing else was added), loan 2 and 3 were finished the same way withing 2 hours after the first started.  3 loans no conditions.  If an underwriter asks me for 1 thing I messed up my job.      You are told you are 3 days from underwriting you better have everything there before they pick up that file.  Otherwise you have a horrible broker.  Clearly you get a condition that you never thought about but its rare.    In my case once it hits an underwriter and im not cleared to close in 2 hours I find that as a failure.  But if you get conditions back, you go back to the end of the list and plan on another 3-5 days.  If this process has taken more then 2-3 weeks.....  nevermind I wont bash your broker if it has.    Thats just me and Im sure most brokers will agree.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	It isn't irrelevant - most employers will ask to give them an idea of how much they should offer you if they were to offer you a job.  It will give them an idea of what your last employer thought you were worth, and also how much you could be expecting.    You certainly don't *have* to answer, but it is usually detrimental not to.  Most employers will assume that the reason that you won't answer is because you were on a very low wage, and think that if you disclose it they will think that you're too junior for the job and/or will offer you a low wage.    I recruit at very senior levels so obviously people are on a salary rather than an hourly wage, and if people decline to answer this question, I'm not allowed to progress them beyond the first interview.  The reason being that, not only is it important information because of the reasons I've already mentioned, but also, they don't want to interview you several times only to find out that you're more expensive than the salary they were prepared to offer.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	why wouldn;t you?

I would just wait until the interview to tell them that.|`|81SjHk0Haa	Cari makes a good point in that if you say you are paid a low wage and put it on the form then they may think you are too junior. It could work the other way too. if your last employer paid very well and you are applying for a job which is similar but doesn't pay as well, then putting your wage on the form could mean your application goes in the bin.    There is a train of thought that says if you're having to take a pay cut then you won't hang around long.    My wife, who worked in HR advises not to put salaries or wages on application forms but to discuss it either at interview or when offered the job.
2zEGBgL1aa	Here in NH bedbugs are rather common.  And as a Landlord I am very familiar with the rules.  If it's a multi family dwelling, and only one unit is infested, it is assumed that the tenant brought them in and the tenant is responsible for getting them out.  If the infestation extends to more than 1 unit, then it is the landlords responsibility to get them out.  so this kinda sux for landlords because if one person brings them in, and then dosn't take care of the problem, then the bugs will eventually spread and become the Landlords problem.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	If you moved into a brand new apartment and had a bed bug problem the landlord will hold YOU responsible for it.

A good question would be for e.g I read you have about ..... clients, what are you doing to increase your customer base and to keep them? Would the successful applicant for this position receive constant training to ensure they can assist customers with queries related to new products (in this case perhaps new type of accounts)?Could you perhaps expand on your employees team dynamics and how I would fit into the team, should I be offered the position. It's also a good idea to take a pen and notepad to an interview and to take notes about what is told and perhaps possible questions for later - it shows interest.|`|XLNFjNYiaa	ask dem questions about the job, and if ur unclear of something ask dem, hope dis helps, best answer plz? =P|`|GqTSa85daa	If you don't have any questions just respond, no, you've been clear.

Some of your questions may be answered during the course of the interview, before you are offered the opportunity to ask. If so, you can simply state something to the effect that you were interested in knowing about ..., but that was addressed during the interview. You could ask for additional clarification if applicable. Do not ask questions that are clearly answered on the employer's web site and/or in any literature provided by the employer to you in advance. This would simply reveal that you did not prepare for the interview, and you are wasting the employer's time by asking these questions. Never ask about salary and benefits issues until those subjects are raised by the employer.     Sample Questions:  What are the company's strengths and weaknesses compared to its competition?  How will my leadership responsibilities and performance be measured? By whom?  How much opportunity will I have for decision-making in my first assignment?
2jdYb4lmaa	Good question. When my ex and I seperated, I asked my insurance agent the same thing. They told me  it would be cheaper to stay on the same policy.

Either you're married, or you aren't.     Having said that, it's just plain SENSIBLE, to be absolutely sure you have coverage for any vehicle you own, by carrying insurance on it, as long as your name is on the title.     Don't delete a car from your policy, until the title is out of your name.  You CAN be held responsible for all damages it does, while YOU are the legal owner.
dC6A5R5Saa	A mistake leaning investors make, is they're perfectionists at TA.    The charts represent mass psychology between buyers and sellers, supply and demand of what people think a stock is worth.  When you see it from that perspective, it's easier to have an appreciation for charts.  People aren't always predictable and neither are charts.    Try and estimate with you're horizontal lines.  You could put one at $18 as a major support.  This seems reasonable on the daily/weekly charts since HD hit $18 three times.  You could use $21 as a short-term support or even 20.80.  There's no perfect right or wrong answer.  You need to estimate to master support/resistance.    If you think HD is on an uptrend, use other Information as clues.  The fact that HD raised it's dividend in 2008 and made a profit in a difficult year is good evidence.    With support and resistance lines, the more a stock hits a certain price, the more significant the support/resistance.|`|AA10046969	My personal recommendation, don't buy it.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	They're selling 12 times earnings, with a 0.90 dividend.

X4FQBmo9aa	Using Safari:    Overall, not bad.  If you want a nitty picky critic keep going.  If you want to know if it looks pretty good in general, then it does and you should stop here (be warned I went to art school and have been working in advertising for 9 years, one thing we specialize in is nitty picky).    Home Page - The word "Policy" is half in and half out of the bar.  If you extend the yellow color within the bar, you should be able to fit all the buttons on the same line or you can increase the bars height.     I like the flower image in the lower right corner.  The bottom bar is too close though.  Some space between the two would work well. Perhaps you could increase the bars height, drop the word "Privacy" to the second line, then you could make the bar shorter on the right side so that it does not touch the flower image.      The box at the top beneath the flowers seems off balanced.  Perhaps increasing the font size just a little will help.  It just feels like there is a lot of empty space within the box.  You could try reducing the height of the box instead if you do not want to increase the font size.  Also, the yellow seem very flat.  The green and red have nice gradients and I really like the texture on the red.  It makes the mustard seem very flat in comparison.  Maybe play with it if you have the time...    If you could add a subtle drop shadow on the "Seed Needs" & "Most Popular Picks" titles it would make them stand out a little more.  Definitely nothing too big.  Something low opacity, slight angle, not a lot of pixels.      Other pages:  Same critic applies.  Also, whenever a flowers name is more than one line it drops the quantity selection and add to cart buttons down.  Perhaps you could increase the standard space between the rows of flowers so that the single line flower names are on the same level?    Hope that helps.  I think you have a great start here.  Your flower shots are very vibrant and well selected.|`|bikDnJdlaa	Page looks nice. A few things wrong. With the page background being so dark, the black text (especially the names of the items you are trying to sell) is hard to read.  Try using a lighter color. Also, some of the links of the flower names won't take you to the product description, but just take you back to the homepage. And when clicking the 'About Us', 'Contact Us', 'Testimonials' , it doesn't really take you anywhere. Plus, sometimes the 'links' aren't actually links; just text. Also, I notice at the bottom of the page it reads; Ordering Onfo...instead of Info.    Not sure if your site is up and running, or if you're just looking for design advise before you start. But again, the overall look is nice.|`|0mW0LC1Iaa	i like it...my only advice is to make the background not so dark...it kinda makes it dull

So if it was in John Smith's name when there was a mortgage, it stays in John Smith's name when it's paid off.    Heirs, are different.    When John Smith dies, an estate is created...if he has no will, then the property goes through probate, and then each of his heirs are entitled to equal portion of the estate.    If John Smith left a will, then the interest will be divided equally between named heirs unless specified differently.|`|AA11132354	Changing title requires a Deed.  Generally a Warranty Deed.  If it's between related parties, or co-heirs, a QuitClaim Deed will do.
xJi3ixgGaa	It is my understanding that it is NOT retro active.  The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter.  Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place.  The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.      HOWEVER this is where a lot of people don't understand.  Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000.  You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000.  You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10.  If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars.  For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	The details haven't really been hammered out. But, anyone who bought a home in the last year as a primary residence will get 10% of the value of the home, up to $15,000, as a tax credit.     It's supposedly intended to give people relief who are upside down on their mortgages. But, the people who are really hurting are the ones who bought between 2005 and 2007, not 2008. So, I don't know how effective it's going to be. Except that people who bought last year and maybe part of this year are making out, even though they are not in financial straits.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	NO ONE knows how it will work, since the bill has only been passed by the Senate thus far.

9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	How do you know?  Because the seller is going to give you a copy of the lease contract stating the date that she is to be out.    As a new LL, you are going to give, as a courtesy, probably more than a 30 day notice that you don't intend to renew the lease.    If she isn't out by then, then you'll have to evict her...but she still owes you for every day she stays.    My advice?  Write the contract to close when the tenant is out.    PS:  The seller doesn't have to convince you to "agree" to take the lease...if there is a lease, real estate law requires you to honor it if you buy the property.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Chances are very strong that the current owner will not the sell the house to you unless you agree to take on the lease.  To do so would place the current owner in legal jeopardy with the tenant.    You need to inquire concerning what will happen with the lease and the tenant.|`|H17L1WW4aa	Normally it will go with the house.  Ask for a copy of the lease.  The owner will provide it to you.    There might be an exemption in the lease that allows you to take over if you buy it.  But in most cases the lease will follow the home.    Check your state laws, but most states are that way.  Once their lease is expired you can increase the lease to 10 billion a day or they can leave.  But for the most part you are buying the property with that lease.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	A lease always goes with the property not with the owner.  If you purchase the property make it known to the tenant that at the end of the lease period she will be required to move, if that's your intention.  Do you want the tenant to continue to rent the property after your purchase?  If so, go to the tenant now and ask what her intentions are at the expiration.  After you buy the property you can always rewrite the lease if the tenant is agreeable.      An expiration of a lease does not require any notice for the tenant vacate, at least in my state, but is wise to make the tenant  know you expect her to be out of the premises on the lease expiration date, again if that is your intention.|`|AA11132354	Lease transfers from owner to owner, stays with property.  If she doesn't leave at end of lease, you evict her.  She knows she has lease and when it expires.  You can make it part of contract that owner turn it over vacant to you--but you'll have to put up the money to buy tenant out of her lease.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	No the lease stays with the property.

If you are an accomplished typist - word processor and have recently visited your local 4-year university librarian, you can apply as a "certified" graduate typist, earning between $1.50 to $2.00 per page for typing a master or doctoral thesis. The librarian will ask the following questions in order to qualify you as a "certified" typist:    (1) Are you familiar and have a working knowledge of Microsoft Word?    (2) Are you able to set up section breaks along with appropriate placement of auto page numbering in the footer/header?    (3) Are you familiar with setting up a scheme with emphasis on the proper use of auto numbering, such as 1., 1.1, (a), (i), etc.?    (4) Do you have access to a scanner with built-in OCR sofware?    (5) Do you have access to a high-speed laser quality printer?    If you answer all the above questions in the affirmative, the librarian will provide you with a sample of the typing format template (i.e., margin settings, font selection, page set up, etc.) in order to complete these projects.     The librarian will then place your name on a list of "certified" graduate typists. This "certified' list will be given to various department heads so that any graduate student seeking your services can easily contact you directly from this list.

AA11284831	Plenty of returns have been delayed for 1 to 3 weeks this year.  The IRS is not saying why on any specific return though the most likely culprit appears to be incorrect claims under the Recovery Rebate Credit.  Many folks either failed to enter the correct amount of last year's stimulus rebate in the tax software or deliberately omitted it when they saw that it reduced their apparent refund.  If the numbers don't match the IRS records, processing is delayed while the IRS manually reviews the numbers.  It's not likely that the Lifetime Learning Credit is the culprit.

AA10691226	This is an existentialist-phenomenological approach, which I like. ;-)    It means that you figure out your assembly lines, your add-on workstations, your incoming and outgoing short-term storage areas (including quality control), accommodate the ability to reconfigure workflow several different ways to accommodate changes in manufacturing requirements for the working life of the facility, and THEN you put the skin (or the outside of the building [read: walls and roofs]) around it.     It's sort of like putting in sod and no paths; you make the paths later when you see where people trod down the grass, making their own paths.

PZZkjST7aa	I think you've been told wrong as well and I'm pretty shocked the man was so rude to you. There are two types of JSA, income and contribution based, if you haven't got enough NI contributions in the prescribed years you apply for income based which is means tested and savings are taken into account. However you qualify if your savings are under 16,000, and if your savings are between 6,000 and 16,000 a 'tariff' income is assumed and your JSA is deducted by 1 for every 250 that you have over 6,000. It is possible that you would also qualify for some reduced council tax benefit, so you should apply for this as well.  Have a look here at the direct.gov.uk site, there is an interactive advisory assessment you can fill in, it definitely gives the upper savings limit at 16,000:  http://campaigns.direct.gov.uk/benefitsa...  I don't think putting your money where you can't get at it so easily makes a lot of difference in spite of what the guy said, it is still counted as capital, if you have 2,000 'surplus' they should only be taking off about 8 a week anyway, so it is probably better just to play it straight. If you spend the extra money and they question it you have to prove that you have not 'deprived yourself of it' in order to get more benefit, i.e. you had to spend it on the central heating boiler, keep receipts etc, but a holiday wouldn't be looked on so favourably.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	Ignore him. If he wanted that kind of savings, he should have married and then divorced your husband.    You are allowed to have savings but not earnings on the savings. When you submit your tax returns, which you have to, you let them know then.    BUT you must tell them, when you fill in the form for benefits. If it is to be counted as income then they will tell you how and how much.    I have an idea but am not certain that you're allowed more than 8k savings and still claim benefit.    ALSO you can claim housing benefit for your mortgage and council tax benefit AND if you live alone you can claim a 25% reduction on your council tax anyway . . on benefit or not.|`|iCzMOXOWaa	yes you are allowed a certain amount,i would take some out,and say you had to buy a car or furniture or something,then re-apply,they always want evidence of your savings!!they are a nightmare to deal with, if you tell the truth,you would be better off lieing like everyone else it makes it much simpler!interest rates are non-existent as well now so theres nothing to lose!|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	I think you've been told wrong.    Like you I think you are allowed to have a certain amount in savings before they affect any claim you make, I'm not sure what that amount is but I thought it was above 6,000.    As for Job Seekers allowance, that isn't means tested anyway, it's contributions based.  I think you should be able to claim for the Council Tax regardless of your savings.    My husband keeps getting laid off and we have savings well above anything that would count so we can't claim any help, we just get the Job Seekers allowance.    I would suggest you should really be looking at the government website about this, not asking about it here.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	You can have 15.000 savings and still claim Job Seekers Allowance, but you may get a reduced rate.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	i never told them about my savings lol    i opened another bank account with a different bank to the one with my savings and just give them, them details     i think it's out of order that they should even think about making you use your savings    the thing i hate about the government is that they are more than happy to help those who cant be arsed to help them self's    they don't help the ones who are actually looking for a job the ones who want to work     the ones who pay into the system (tax/NI) and get nothing back when they need it .    to me none of it makes Sense.  that's why i don't plan on staying in this country.|`|bea06f34d0b27c46fd2e0ca8740043bfaa	Firstly, to make yourself feel better, I would report the SOB! What a cheek to even say that. You are allowed to have savings of up to 6,000.00 to qualify for Job Seekers, but anything between that and 16,000.00 will be at a reduced rate. If you want to check, just type in Jobseekers Allowance on search and it will tell you exactly what you need to know. Good Luck.
Q16h2iz3aa	I had the same problem last week in the Orlando area.  We were going to buy a townhouse but the legal description had it listed as a condo and we were unable to find a lender.  First bump in the road was FHA is not lending money for mostly all condos; we went looking for other options and found that no banks want to lend money to buy a condo, even though we have 10% to put down and good credit.

Then say, as you are well aware, my daughter has a  medical condition that has called for a lot of my time and attention.  Unfortunately at this point, I feel that my priority lies with being more actively involved in her care and schooling, and I regret that I must resign from my position, effective (date).    Then close by saying agian how much you appreciate everything they've done for you, and say should your situation ever change, you would appreciate if they would provide you with references regarding your job performance (or even ask for an opportunity to interview with them again, should a positon be open at that time.)

Last nights call to IRS Agent  5 told me that mine was still being processed although nothing is wrong with it (i efiled Jan 15) and that I shouldn't go by the WMR because its not right (???) and I need to wait the full 3 weeks before I call again!! the 8-15 days that the tax programs promise is false and we should not believe it. IT TAKES 3 WEEKS!! ( now this is all being told me by  5) Also, the "system" only updates once a week and so it "should" be updated NEXT Monday and that the "system" is what generates a deposit date!!! it is all done by computer. They can not over ride it manually (ok, whatever)... !|`|bu2BPue7aa	Pure,     I have spoken to several people at the IRS who say the Where's my refund" site is not giving accurate deposit dates and not to go by those dates.  Also they give you Tuesday deposit date, they say to allow bank processing time.|`|ThZXnBjAaa	got dangit, i'm mad.  i don't believe this fricking sh-t. i want my money.  lying a-s people not depositing my fricking refund!  wtf is wrong with them mf's?|`|wsibGTaLaa	I was supposed to get mine on 2/3, it hasn't changed but I am sure it will soon because it has not been deposited into my account. I called the IRS and they are clueless, complete waste of time.|`|DSQpitk5aa	LOL right there with you on the "wake up!" advice. Some people are diehard intent on that stupid chart. Obviously they don't read your whole posting ...   My refund was changed to the 10th as well and when I asked what the "processing error" was I was told "it's none of your concern - if we needed you to do something we would have sent you a letter by now". In other words it wasn't my fault.   My status has not changed to an exact date yet (still just approx date of 10th). Let us know if yours updates! This year is sure a whole new experience.

RNqRnG86aa	Cost would be defined as the miscellaneous expenses the vendor (seller) incurs to get the goods to the port. The vendor is responsible for paying the needed costs and freight involved to take the goods to the indicated port of destination;    The responsibility over the goods is transferred from the vendor to the buyer at the very moment that goods are crossing the ships rails at the loading port;      The buyer should receive the goods at the port of destination and then, as from that point, be responsible for all expenses;     The vendor is responsible for the custom clearance of goods for export purposes;     The vendor must hire and pay the insurance of the main transport;     The insurance paid by the vendor has minimum coverage, so it is for the buyer to evaluate the need to have a supplementary insurance made or not;     The risks as from the delivery point (after transposing the ships rails) are the buyers;     Clause only usable in the sea, river or lake transportation.

bEVEvtXGaa	There is really only a few distinct ways to make money in life. One is by providing a service. Two is by selling a product. And 3 is by advertising. Since you already have traffic coming to your website and you are looking for a way to monetize this into monthly revenue, I would suggest selling advertising space on your website to advertisers.     Google Adsense does this by placing Text Link ads on your website and paying you for clicks. Another way to accomplish this without having to use Google is by selling Text Link space on your site for other webmasters. A fantastic tool that automates this process is called TextAds. It's a text link rotator script that you can download at http://www.SellTextLinkAds.com - Not only is this script fully customizable making it easy to seamlessly integrate into your existing site, but it allows advertisers to signup and create their own text link campaigns. TextAds manages all of your accounts, ad campaigns and gives you complete control over your advertising on your website.    Also, TextAds uses PayPal to accept payments for advertising space instantly giving you the ability to earn a monthly income without having to constantly update your links. What makes the TextAds link rotator script much more efficient than Google Adsense is you get 100 percent of your profits instead of getting paid pennies for clicks by Google. I would recommend any webmaster or blogger looking for a better way to earn money from text links on your site to check out http://www.SellTextLinkAds.com|`|i3s9r9vPaa	THIS SITE HAS CHANGED MY LIFE...WISH IT CHANGES UR S TOO..!:)    i was looking for a genuine opportunity to earn online...but i got scammed and came to conclusion that such a thing does not exist..then i came to know about this site through one of my friends...n now i am earning a decent income as a student online..ABSOLUTELY FREE....just wanted to make others life happy too..    happy earning    http://earning-online-free.blogspot.com/    n as a frd can u do me a small favour  if at all u r not interested in the content ,atleast do forward to all ur frds..let them aleast be benefited...!

x5Cqft2zaa	Usually when you order something off a website and you receive the "bill me later" option, you receive an invoice with the item you ordered.  As far as I know, you shouldn't be charged any extra.  However,if you don't pay the balance in full at the time of receipt of the bill there may be fees applied.  All of the repayment details should accompany the invoice.
YQ1Q7XeEaa	You need to ask roller coaster design firms this question.  Do your research and find out who is doing the work on these machines.  Call them up and ask for a VP of engineering - or at least their contact info.  Write them an email saying you would like to learn what it takes to become one of them and why you want to do that kind of work.    I would be surprised if you didn't get really good answers out of those folks.
EXJfoGtAaa	I presume you are evicting for non payment of rent.  You just need to claim the tenant hasn't paid.  It's the tenant's responsibility to prove otherwise.  Google landlord tenant laws in your state.  If the tenant didn't pay because you didn't fix something, you should prevail, because the laws don't permit tenants to withhold rent.  A key to the tenant's defense will be whether or not they deposit the rent with the court prior to the hearing date.  The eviction complaint should have the date by when the tenant must deposit the money.  If that's passed and they didn't pay to the court, you will be awarded possession.  The judge will explain what happens next.  In most states the tenant will then be served with a notice to vacate, usually within 48 hours.    realtor.sailor|`|4HoVVCenaa	Take all the documents with you that might pertain, and just be straight forward with the judge. He is on your side if you have any kind of a case. Don't be smart or cute, just honest, and sincere. Don't provide much emotion, but a little won'tl hurt. Don't go into tirades. Stay on subject.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	It will be easier to just have the money to pay your back rent|`|c0f6bd3b726b4f3a16f21d6f8759e7abaa	to be ask y you didn't pay, y u got behind, when will you be able to pay,or payment plans, the money you owe and be address and a theif, and remove all you things.|`|b5ed16c940be1868f0aa615afa8d8e15aa	You'll be asked why you're seeking an eviction, and have an opportunity to present your case. If you're seeking an eviction for reasons other than non-payment, it will help if you have proof [ie: if they've totally destroyed your property, a move-in condition report + recent pictures = yay, or if they've violated the lease, it's nice if you can pull out a copy of a letter and a return receipt showing that you contacted them in writing to inform them of the infraction and give them a chance to remedy it. If you're evicting for non-payment].    Stay calm, stick to the facts, don't throw in irrelevant details, and don't lash out at the tenant. If you feel the need to say "Unemployed dirt bag who spends his money on hookers and cheap beer", bite your tongue.     The tenant will be given a chance to respond and present their case. If you're justified in your quest for an eviction, the judge will side with you, and probably give the tenant somewhere between 14-30 days to vacate (may be more or less, depending on your state).  It's quick and pretty easy.  If you're unsure, or you'd like to know exactly what you're in for, you can probably go sit in on a hearing before yours comes up.|`|AA11132354	Suggest you go to court a day or week earlier and sit in the court and see what happens.    Be prepared, and be organized.  Have a list of the payments the tenant missed, late payment penalties, totals, have a copy of the lease and Notice to Quit with you, plus any other notices or letters served on tenant.  Cases with attorneys involved go first, so you will hear some before yours, most likely, but better to go another day.
AA11284831	Why do you think that you'd get it all back?  You are NOT in the "same exact position" as you were last year!  Your income increased by nearly $5,000.    The first $8,950 in 2008 isn't taxed.  But the income above that IS taxable.  You would only receive a full refund if your income was $8,950 or less.  Your income LAST year was below the filing requirement amount of $8,750 for 2007 so that's why you got it all back LAST year.    The calculated refund is correct.  It has nothing to do with the stimulus rebate that you received last year.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You made more money so you actually had taxable income this year.  That is the difference and why you aren't getting back everything you paid in.    The stimulus isn't being subtracted from your taxes now, its just that if someone didn't receive it and they should have they have a 2nd chance to get it now when they file their '08 tax return, which is why there is a $300 difference between when you say you got it and then say you didn't.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No, you are not "supposed to."|`|707gOCvbaa	If all 3 softwares are telling you the same thing it's safe to assume that a small change was made for this year and you are only entitled to the amount shown. No one can explain it to you unless you go to a tax preparer and they will rob you blind. You are not being taken for what you assume should be refunded. It is what it is and just accept it. good luck.|`|NsbGM74iaa	12k minus standard deduction minus personal exemption leaves you with a tax liability so no you dont get all your federal withholding back.

cOJyoXEhaa	With the amount of people out of work and if the job is not union, good luck getting anything higher. There are people taking anything they can get so employers are using that to only pay minimum wage. It does not matter what education you have. In business its called supply and demand. If you go to your local state office building, unemployment has hundreds of openings across the country in the processing dept. with your age your experience is low, so an older person would be more qualified for some positions remember. Good luck in your search.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	This is not a good answer, but I l will answer what I know from life experience.  Nobody starts at the top.  My first job was at 1.25 per hour.  From age 18 to 61, I was never out of work other than vacation or sick.  The most I made from a salaried job was $55,000 per year. How did I do it? I took what was available until I found something that paid 1/3rd more than I was making.  You have to work your way up in life.  My reward now is a good social security check, military retirement check, VA disability monthly check & private company retirement check.  By the way I have a B.S. in business administration.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	If you have a resume, post it on the job boards (CareerBuilder, Monster, Yahoo Jobs, etc) and check out those sites for job possibilities.  It always looks better in a job-search to already have a job, but it could also be nice to be able to go on an interview whenever they ask for you, which is hard to arrange when you are already working.|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	What is your educational background? Is it just highschool or did you take a trade in College or University? There are tons of jobs out there if you are trained properly and not have to deal with minimum wage jobs that go nowhere. If you are unhappy with your current education, there are support systems in place you can look into that will allow you to train in needed professions and help you out financially. You also might want to start looking in a different city if you have the education. Some companys will pay for relocation expenses. I hope everything works out for you.|`|qBCGH52haa	Look at the situation from a different perspective - you now have a modicum of income that will sustain you temporarily while you look for a situation more to your liking.  While the pay sucks, one of two things can now happen - a) You impress the boss and get offered a full-time position with a raise or b) You use the part-time aspect of the job to full potential - scheduling interviews for other jobs during your hours off.    Use the income you will be getting to continue your job hunt...even at $6.55 an hour, for 20 hours a week, that should give you $80 to $90 a week that you can use to help fund the job search (nice resume, cover letters on bond paper, etc.).    Look around for professional organizations that you can join (use the activities for networking), talk to supervisors at Ross and let them know you are interested in something more than just part-time/low-wage, keep in touch with friends and others that can help find open positions, don't burn any bridges (always act professional, even if it galls you ;)  This is a tough time economically speaking so you need to use all avenues open to you.      I note that you say you have experience and educational background.  If the education is college, check the school and see if they have a career/job center.  Ask about the on-campus interviews (are they open only to current students?), post resumes wherever you can.  Look for additional training opportunities (especially if you can get one cheap through a government agency).  Heck, take an HR Block income tax prep course for the extra money :)    good luck in your job search.|`|i3s9r9vPaa	try working online..it ll surely help..

But it will probably be longer than that.|`|AA11284831	The tax software that you used  is irrelevant to when you get your refund.  It would have been the same with TaxCut, Tax Act, Tax Slayer or any of a few dozen other lesser players.  You'll get your refund when you get it.|`|l0NRdN3Faa	That's a good question o.o|`|2BEMSGPdaa	I just used the free  e file the other day and I got an e mail that it is accepted..|`|3fYRi1y4aa	Yes I used it for the first time this year.

pCEA7Pu8aa	You can contact your lender and ask for a loan modification. If you have the income to support the payments they will work with you.    They key is make them think that if they do not help you you are going to not be able to make anymore payments.    They do not want another foreclosure on their hands and if you play your cards right you can usually get really good rates. I did my own a little while ago without missing a payment and got one year at 1% the next year at 3% then a year at 5% the next at 5.5% and then locked in for the remainder of my mortgage at 6.25%.    Give it a try. I am currently $60,000 upside down.     That is also good information to pass on to them. If they are greedy make them think that you will stop paying and they will get a house back after spending $40,000 to foreclosure that is worth even less.    There are also lots of companies out there that will help you with that process. Watch out!!! They can only collect upfront fees if they are licensed mortgage brokers. The exact rules vary from state to state but know that there is now a huge business in taking advantage of distressed homeowners.
Ch9TedMcaa	It means separate companies. Different stocks from different companies.      ex. Wal mart is individual stock.|`|WgT5l14baa	It's when you buy shares in a specific (individual) company as opposed to buying into a pool of stocks like and ETF or a mutual fund.|`|h9SQn62Oaa	it's when you wake up in the morning and accidently put on two different socks that have both been lying in a pool of syrup, making them sticky.   Individual Stocks|`|731762ff5b663deba6422ffbee7b6ebcaa	A little context might help...|`|AA10566552	When people refer to individual stocks, they are referring to shares of individual companies as opposed to mutual funds, ETF's, hedge funds or other diversified products that offer a basket of stocks or other securities.  In other words, if you buy 100 shares of Microsoft (msft) @ $18 / share, you are essentially buying a small portion of the company.  If you put that same $1,800 in a mutual fund, you will be buying a smaller portion of many different companies.

W9zRaPp9aa	Hi B Ron,    First of all, there is no Licensing required for wholesale operations. There is also no such thing as an Importers license.     What you will need though is a licensed Customs Broker to clear your shipments through Customs when they arrive from over seas.    To legally operate your business, you will need and Resale Tax License from your state Department of Revenue. This is a simple form, but normally requires a cash deposit based on what the potential sales tax revenues would be over a 3 month period. You are then required to submit sales taxes to the State, normally on a quarterly basis.    Remember, though, Sales to out of state locations are non taxable, so the majority of your sales would not involve sales tax.    Your local city or County may also require a Business license. This can normally be acquired through your local city hall or County Seat.    Good luck with your new venture.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	There is no such thing as a wholesale license--it is a sellers permit & it is for tax collecting (wholesale = no sales tax, resale = sales tax collected).  You get that from your state's franchise tax board.  You may also need a import license; and a business license.  Business licenses are from the city you are housed in.
AA11744987	Its not going to be easy but your going to have to tell him how you and your co-workers feel. It is better to let him know why you think he is not making money and how you can try to get customers back.

I know times are tough, good luck.|`|ghItgMZxaa	people like that are hard to work for.  if he raised his prices that much its not going to last that long, means he is trying to make a fast buck.  if i were you i would tell him your opinion and walk out he donut deserve to have a business.|`|todVA7CGaa	u should stert own business like me at   http://youronlinejobs.com

q0oZ8eOzaa	I am no longer in that situation myself but I work with others that are similarly oncall one of more days per month. They basically go about their daily lives but keep in close proximity to their home  where they have a computer which is set up to handle the calls if they come in. So you need to develop a routine that incorporates your job but not let this consume you.    Hopefully you will work your way out of this situation and so just hang in there a while longer and remember that you are getting some experience and a line item on your resume for the future.

382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	We bought our house privately.  We went to a solicitor and put everything down in writing, ( the price, transferring of titles to our name, and anything else.) The owners went to their solicitor and did the same thing.)    I'm not sure if a solicitor is necessary, but if you do have one, maybe give them a ring and see what they say. Selling privately is a great idea if you already have an offer you are happy with.    How exciting for you!!|`|TpMvr1pyaa	of course.

UeLigNB0aa	You do not need 20% equity to refinance. You can refi into an FHA loan with as little as 3.5% equity. As far as making your ex refinance, there is nothing you can do about it unless you want to file for a divorce and try and get a judge to force the issue.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	likely nothing; This is a time when you must bite the bullet of  discomfort.    OR try to sell Part of the house!|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	They only way you may be able to get out of it without cooperation from the other party (refinancing) would be to file a partition suit.  But I hear that is a long and expensive process.|`|H17L1WW4aa	Seriously man you cant,    I gave my best answer.  You signed on a piece of paper saying you would be on the loan until its paid in full.  The bank could care less if you separated or not.    To give you an example, a divorce court says okay you are liable to pay the mortgage.  And lets say this person doesnt.  Guess how much the lender cares?  They dont, They come after you.    Even a court cant release you from a mortgage you have signed.  They can only force the other person to sell it.  You are headed to court where a judge will decide who owns the property but they cant force the lender to release you.    Unless the judge requires you to sell the property if she doesnt get you off of the loan in X number of days.  I gave you the easy answer.  This is your reality.  You are on that loan until its paid off.

Of course they would. Go down to your local homeless shelter and volunteer for a day. Maybe then you'll be a bit more grateful for what you have.     I understand you're 14, but grow up a little.

124497556bfb4613dd2c9273ba87e2f1aa	Let me first answer you saying that I am one of the people that has purchased one of these courses off of the television. I bought the Carlton Sheets course and found the material fascinating.     At the time I bought it I owned a Janitorial business and I was not at all happy with it. The business although providing me a decent lifestyle was not ultimately very fulfilling. I was also interested in diversifying my financial portfolio so it was very intriguing to me.     It took about 6 to 8 months after going through the course thoroughly to find the right first deal and I walked away from the escrow table with over $40k in cash. Since then I have been involved in over a hundred transactions, I have lost money on a few deals but by and large it has been a very profitable business. I still to this day do real estate investing. I bought and closed on a property @ 639 W 24th Street in Ogden, UT (I believe you can do an internet search on that address and find some documentation I have published on my progress) I bought this property for $42k it is worth $90k fixed up and I took home a check for $7500.00 from escrow so this for me is better than no money down I got paid to buy it. My intent is to fix it up ($14k to repair it) With agent listing fees etc... I stand to make $15k to $20k profit.     The reason I mentioned that deal is I wanted to sincerely tell you that you can do what they talk about in those late night infomercials. The deal I just talked about I have done multiple times and in fact I have 2 more similar set to close in the next few weeks.     What is misleading about those commercials is that it is so easy. Real Estate Investing just like anything else is hard work, you have lots of phone conversations, meet and greets, relationship building and lots and lots of research. It is a business that is not get rich quick but rather a slow and steady system for wealth creation.     If you buy the Carlton Sheets course realize that it is written by a gentlemen who has been out of the game for quite a while. The information is generic but it will get you the ideas of the basics. Even though real estate investing seems like a pretty specific term it isn't. There are many types and strategies for doing it and each have their ups and downs. Buying and holding rentals, Fixing up and flipping them for profit, Short sales, lease options, seller financing, and brokering notes are just a few aspects of this business. That is why his course is so good because it covers so many of these aspects and gets you a really good overview of the real estate investing world.    Once you read through those courses you will begin to get a good idea of what specific type of deals you are looking to do. Even though I got started with the Carlton Sheets course  I have expanded my knowledge considerably into other areas specifically relating to what kind of deal I like to do.     For instance my primary specialty is to buy foreclosed (REO) properties, remodeling them and reselling for profit (Otherwise Known as flipping). I am still aware and have tried being a landlord, and doing lease options but my most comfortable feel in the market is flipping.     Buying and reading these courses will give you a good overview of what you want to do and from their you can gain specific knowledge. I recommend before you buy off TV look on eBay for the same thing. Sometimes you can pick up a used real estate course for $50 and the information is still the same.     Once you decide what kind of investing you want to do you can begin to seek after specific knowledge. this would be best obtained in the field. I would join a real estate investor club and start attending their meetings. See what happens at these meeting and meet the other investors. Some of these investors will be open to an apprentice type relationship. I have taught many people this business from this very angle. I usually give them a small slice of pie to learn from me and then we do several deals together until they are ready to do some on their own.    In short though I will tell you to read, read, read, their are tons of books written on the subject and lots of materials to go over. Their are also tons of free resources so don"t feel the need to spend a lot of money.    Try the free resources first then look to spend some money when you are sure of the direction you wish to go.    Next go out and do a deal. Don't get locked in analysis paralysis. Once you have enough knowledge to feel comfortable just do it. Find a mentor in the real estate investing club to help you out or give his advice. Some wont be willing to but some will. I am always willing to help out anyone in my market that has a real estate investing question.

It meant that they were able to train me in their style of serving rather than having bad habits from a previous job.

NcFWcO3Laa	Section 8 housing is a federal housing program that pays for all or a percentage of the rent for the poor or working poor depending on income and how many in the family.  It is administrated by local governments, usually by county or city.    It directly pays the landlord the governments share of the monthly rent and the tenant directly pays the balance of the agreed rent.  These contracts are 12 months in duration and can be renewed every year.  Section 8 inspects the condition of the property on a yearly basis making sure that the property continues to meet the standards.

UGKyO4HQaa	Well kid it seems like you're on the right track.  You talk about your passions.  There's an old saying that says something to the effect of "Find out what brings you to life and make a living at it, because the world doesn't need people doing their jobs,  the world needs people that come alive."  I enjoy drawing also, but rarely get the chance these days.  I'm back in school working on my pre-nursing classes and at over twice your age am looking at going into an RN program and changing my career.  It's terrifying, but you should never be afraid to sacrifice what you are for what you could become, they say.  I still cut out pictures I appreciate though, and keep a box full of them so when life does settle down, I will go back to my artwork as a stress reliever.  It sounds like you have a couple of choices ahead of you.  Do a little investigating, maybe volunteer at your local animal shelter and get to know some vets so you can see what some of the stress is about that burns them out so quickly.  You are  quite young, still, and have a couple years to make your decision.  As far as the poor thing...learn to be content when you don't have much.  Create a budget and stick to it.  Learn good money management skills now and you won't be forced to "be poor" again.  Life is not about what we get, it's about what we give.  I hope this helps a bit.  Good luck with your decision.|`|KDrztUEpaa	I think you should totally go for it! if it is something you truly want to do, you won't burnout!

Think of a product or service you could distribute. Best to choose something that people need or want, but that is not readily available. I know, this is the hard part. The answer depends on who your customers are. For instance, if you lived in a retirement community, babysitting wouldn't work, since you can't drive to get to customers elsewhere.     2. Locate a supplier for the product or service. It could be you or somebody you employ or contract with.    3. Advertise and get customers.    4. Provide the product or service.     5. Collect your money and keep proper records so you can pay your taxes.    Look for a young entrepreneur program at your school. If you can learn how to run a business early you will have a big head start.

53269c516e58e8f3637e2f6735d02876aa	It can vary by company, however most internal auditors will spend their time evaluating risks and the corresponding mitigating controls.    First, auditors determine risks. They do this typically be interviewing subject matters experts in the organization. Often the subject matter expert will not know the risks so the auditor will need to know how to ask the right questions. (This is the hardest part in my opinion.)    Second, the auditor will determine what controls are in place (or should be in place) to control the risks. Once the controls are identified then the auditor will perform testing.    Third, testing is performed against the controls to validate they are effective. If testing reveals that the control is not working properly then a control breakdown has been identified. (Testing is often the boring part of an audit.)    Finally, the control breakdowns are reported.
OdycmTD4aa	The best thing you can do is retain a good lawyer.  As a partner in the company you should have a copy of the company's bylaws.  In addition to that you and your partner should have drawn up a formal partnership agreement before you ever opened your doors.  Neither one of you has controlling interest, so it's going to be a pissing contest to see who comes out with what.

7dd40ab936ca4ac838b7f8701ef593a1aa	Most areas the water departments are part of the city, and the city is bound to protect its citizens.  Also many states have laws dealing with emergency situations. If a fire department needs water, they can hook onto a public or a private system without charge to protect the public interest.  This includes in some areas, driving up on your yard, and nearly draining your in ground swimming pool. even if your house is not on fire.    In the long run, however the fire departments usually do not use much water in comparison to the whole water district 24 hours a day.. there are rare instances, however  my city for example.. 3-5K gallons a min are used on the average..   on most house fires or even smaller commercial structures we might flow 1.5 to 2K per min, usually alot less for between 30 min and 4 or 5 hours. and this happens 8-12 times a year for us.  so next to nothing in the overall scheme of things.|`|JZG7vpUlaa	Generally water is a public utility, not a private company.

Water Departments have to account for water. We produce X amount of water and we sell Y amount of water. The difference is water that is not accounted for. When we set the price for the water we have to sell, we have to take into account for the cost to produce this unaccounted for water and average it into the overall price that everyone pays.
OdycmTD4aa	Get yourself to your nearest IRS office for FICA and other Federal taxes.  Then beat your feet to your state tax office.

Clearly....your GF is in violation of her lease (no more than two people).      If I was the landlord, I'd evict the whole lot of you.|`|AA11966821	The lease allows only her and her child.  Anyone spending more than a few nights during the term of the lease is hardly a "guest."  You are living there part-time, but you are living there.  He does have a right to charge more rent for an extra person, and considering the landlord provides utilities, a mere $100/mo. extra is an exceptionally generous deal.  Electric heat costs a fortune!  If you keep staying there regularly and/or frequently, he can boot this woman out for violating her lease.

It depends how "legal" you want to be.  If you want to take the hard line - She should drop him a letter explaining that you being a guest does NOT constitute another resident.  And that you have been willing to work with him.  Going forward, you will pay ZERO more dolars.  Stop giving him the extra hundred.    But, I would assume you might want to take a more reasonable course.  The extra $100 should be more than enough.  Just confront him and have a meeting and be firm that $100 is more than enough and he has no legal recourse, anyhow.|`|hZ7AfJPSaa	This is really screwed up, did she get a contract?

Because really you shouldn't even be paying to go over there.  Really .. this guy sounds money hungry and greedy.  I feel bad for your girlfriend and her daughter.    Did you guys ever consider (since you already spend so much time together) getting a place together?|`|nMR5TfGAaa	I don't know about all that IBu guru - part of a lease is reasonable and peaceful enjoyment, which includes guests.  The problem is that they live above her, and they know when you're there.  It would be prudent to try to work something out amicably.  Also consider other reasons why the utilites may have gone up.  It may not solely be because you are her guest and using more resources.  I am positive that NY has a handbook with renters rights.  You should get your hands on a copy immediately so that can assuage these concerns - you may have no rights or this landlor could be way off base.  Better know for sure what you're dealing with.

A 580 FICO is marginal for FHA and both Fannie and Freddie require much higher.    It doesn't matter if the property is a REO or not.....banks must meet FannieMae/FreddieMac or VA/FHA standards and to make the loan and a 550 FICO doesn't meet those standards.    With a foreclosure on your credit record you are going to be renting for at least 2 years no matter what your FICO score is.

All that left to us is fear.|`|hBuOMMRHaa	I don't feel secure about my job because I am already jobless! But I hope to find another job in the future. I am praying for that. We have to remember the promise of God " I will not leave thee nor forsake thee, I will be with thee until the end of the world."  Let not our heart be troubled, we trust the Lord Jesus Christ, for He is the only one who can solve all these problems.|`|P3PZGwDkaa	i think the security of jobs even in the government service is not stable it is just seen good in media but the truth is it is just decorated with political strategy to redirect the attention of most Filipinos on the present situation|`|05b958e47b40b3860899b5e9b1c5c0e8aa	It is buoyant from the skilled to the blue collar workers and gloomy (ever since) for the lazy ones.  There's still a lot of work in the Middle East alone that even retired employees are hired because of manpower shortage there.  All we need is government support by reducing red tape and bureaucracy in processing the worker's papers - straighten up DOLE, POEA and OWWA functions.  It's very frustrating to see workers already sucked up with their savings before they can land and start their job abroad.|`|GJFKID4Haa	Maybe the real question is,how confident are you to get a job?  or how confident are you to stay in the work you have now?  No employer would terminate you if you are doing well in your job,nor no employee would never hire you if you're not qualified to the job you applied for.  In any ways,financial stability always depends on how a person in his innermost will,look for a good cause of money on how he could make his living comfortable.If you are lazy enough, definitely you would never get what you really wanted.  Let's help each other.  If you're an employee,work to help the company prosper. Others work just to get their salaries but never really do their duties. Such attitude contributes to the downfall of the company. If your one of such employee, beware,maybe you're one on the list to be terminated.  If you're an employer, better give good benefits and reasonable salaries to your employees.  In our country's case, let's not blame each other, and not the governments' fault actually.  It all depends on ourselves.  I don't believe there are no jobs here in the Philippines,  there are many vacancies..look and aim for it!|`|DrMDxlWMaa	My wife is Filipino. We have a home in Tarlac province on the main island of Luzon.We share time between the Philippines and the US. To begin with, there is no adequate job market in the philippines My wife is a college grad. there and has a degree in computer science.She could not find a job in her field but took one as a sales clerk. The wages are beyond ridiculous there. When we married, I was working on a contract for an American company at Subic Bay. I made more in one week than she did all year! This is how bad it is there. We now fund education for her relatives and others there.There is a key ingredient to be realized for a countries success: Education; Communication: and Transportation. With it a country can grow and prosper. Without it, they will remain status quo, period!|`|F2hQIffIaa	Kinda negative in my prospective point of view . Actually , if the government wanted to helped  , there's plenty to do . Create more job openings for thos seeking employments & job's . Do not ever attempt to shut any candidates out , juz bcoz , they are retrenched or out of job's , say : unemployed . Make it a fair & square kinda objective & make it known to employees that , we've got the job's for you , are you keen to accept & take on the tasks  . Definitely  , these employess would be jumping up for joy . It's at least better than nothing , no cash , no money & starving  .                  Everyone in the philippines & around the world deserves a fair share of work  . Regardless of work scopes . By shutting these potential employees out & leaving them without job's & in dire consequences such as : desperations , anything can happened . We're all human beings . We want to live , eat , work & have at least proper meals spreads on the dinning table . Sounds fair & square to all isn't it ? ? huh ? ? Even if one is living in poverty , one still deserves at least a proper meal on the dinner table .                 The problem lies with the government  . He or she shouldn't be selfish & thinks about himself or herself in times of financial & economic crisis which happens around the world . Create more job's to equalize , so as to reduced the percentage of unemployment rates in your own society & country . We all want job's & monthly salaries . Without these two items , how can one survived anyway ? ? Begged ? ? not such a great idea in the long run . It's kinda humiliating too . Unless one is : disabled or handicapped . Then , this particular candidate deserves a helping hand & even sympathy  .                 Create more job's & make a vast employment to make lives for everybody , better & reduced unnecessary tensions such as : desperations for employments , & lesser street protests from protesters crying out for help in relates to : unemployments , jobless , starvations , etc . This problem can be minimised . Only if the government has some sort of human conscious after all .               Age is no barrier to both employments & love . So , i hope that everybody is given a fair deal in terms of job's search & employments . Salamat poh .                   Make it an equal employment as a fair employer . Thank you very much=maraming salamat .                   Fm : Albert Pang Tze Kaan(Singapore) .|`|w34xq1R9aa	it is an epidemic everywhere people loss their job and the sad thing about it is that philippine government are doing nothing. i think is going to worsen as time goes by no one knows exactly the economy will recover again, too many greedy politicians.|`|svfBYHFfaa	WE ARE TRAINED TO BE EMPLOYED why not employ yourself i know tou have some ideas for business etc
