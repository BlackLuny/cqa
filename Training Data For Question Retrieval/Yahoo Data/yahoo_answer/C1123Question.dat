I thought it was real from the moment I laid eyes on it.   The first thing was all the C's lined up directly in the middle the way the real ones do, and it definitely seemed real.    It has a bronze looking coach tag on the side with the carriage.   On all the metal balls used to hold it together, it says coach a nd the interior has c's all ligned up the correct way as well. The material on the inside doesn't seem like GREAT quality, but who knows.      I've been forced to think that it may be a 2nd or 3rd, because one part of the stitching is not entirely straight, so im thinking it was a second or third generation.   ???help.

I'm so used to having it long, layered, and straight (occasionally I curl it but they don't really stick). I really want to try bangs, but I worry how they will look on my face. I really like the side-swept bangs, but I wonder if something that blends more into my hair would be a better transition? I'm really short (5'1"), and so I also don't want my hair to overwhelm my face or body. I'm recently addicted to Yahoo! Answers, so I figured I'd give it a try and see what you all think.

The diamond was loose so I had it fixed within the month. Yesterday I went to just get it cleaned and she checked the diamonds and said they were fine. Today I looked at my ring and one of the diamonds were missing. What do I do? I have the extended service plan but it says it doesn't cover missing diamonds. This is ridiculous! Will they give me a new one or do I need to buy another one?

Since Januray 26th 2009 I started at a regular 20 gauge, that was my birthday, then i got bored that night and went straight to 10s, got bored an hour later and did the stupidest thing ever and went to fours. they finally healed up after two minor infections, and then 2 weeks from then, i went to a 2 gauge. okay so yesterday, i bought some 00 tapers from spencers (acryllic) and had my friend shove those through, suprisingly there wasn't a whole lot of direct pain, but now i have them in and they are still killing me, but the odd thing is. Earlier my friend wanted to make sure they look okay, so i said alright man, took one taper out and there was a BIG hole (expected) but there was alot of bleeding, and a small tear, he said it was normal and that it would heal up, but it's got me worrying even more and more. My other ear however, has a VERY small tear going up the ear, both bleed very badly when i take them out, basically what im asking is what i should do? im not going to take them out or go to the hospital, so..should i leave them in for about a week so they wont bleed, and then see what happens, or what? I need advice.

It is not red, not sore (except for a little bit when i touch it cause i hit it pretty hard this morning) and its not pusing or anything (just a little bit of whitish lymph that is normal since it's only 3 months old) I havent changed the ring because im waiting for 6 months.  I wash it almost everyday (somedays I just forget lol) in the shower with Dial antibacterial soap, and once in a while i do sea salt soaks, like every other day.      But it just seems like there is less skin there than before, like its a shallow piercing, of course maybe its just that the swelling went down and now I think theres less skin, but idk.  I didnt start to notice this until about a month ago.      So do you think it's rejecting?

My hair now is about an inch and a half - 2 inches past my shoulders with side bangs that are to the left and end at the bottom of my eye. I wanted to go for a new style, possibly a short one because I straighten my hair alot so I have alot of split ends and I am sick of them. However, everyone I talk to tells me that I have beautiful hair and the other night my boyfriends mom asked me if I am getting my hair cut and she asked if I was getting it cut short and I said yes and she was like " Aww, don't cut it short hun you have beautiful hair, I love it" my boyfriend likes it too and says I will always be beautiful to him even if I was bald but I am scared he won't like it. I love long hair, I just have a problem with keeping it healthy and long. Should I cut it short or just get a trim? I really don't know.      Thanks so much in advance.   Much love.

My friends and I were shopping at abercrombie today and my friends and I picked out a shirt that we both tried on.

20090223065210AA2WguJ	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Grrr i dont get why guys do this?? They think I'm a snob?	Ok so firstly if i go somewhere with friends and am introduced to some of their guy friends, most of the time they kind of ignore me. It makes me insecure about myself when this happens. But then later, my girl friends will tell me that they thought I was very pretty (not that I think so myself).    It just seems to me that whenever I am out somewhere I will get a lot of looks from guys, and yet hardly ever spoken to. Some think I'm a snob, when really I'm just shy.   What could I do to seem less like a snob? I'm seriously not like that at all, but short of putting a permanent smile on my face (which is impossible) I don't know how to appear less judgemental and snobby.    Any tips?   I guess it's kind of my own fault sometimes for expecting the guy to make the first moves.      Im 17 btw.   thanks :)

Been to salons to do hair treatment but these don't help much.   I don't have any natural curls. The top part of my hair is nice and straight but the below half tangles easily.

20090223060907AAHeKqD	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair dye question? Blonde to black?	Okay, so I've never dyed my hair before. But I plan to in a few months, and I just wanted to get as well informed as I could about it. :)    So I'm a natural blonde, and by now it's kind of a sandy blonde color or something.. brown in some places.. iunno. one way or another, its not the really light blonde, and I don't like it. I've got a really faire complexion and blue-gray eyes, and I just think it would look cooler with black hair than with blonde.. So anyway, is it possible? Or is the change just too drastic and will end up some weird color? Any advise or tips or anything that I should consider? Something I should watch out for or anything? I plan to go to a hair saloon, but I don't think my mom really approves of this idea so she might not be willing to pay for it so I might end up with some crappy hair dye in my own bathroom or something.. well any advise will be appreciated. Thankz. XD

I buy pants that are a little big or a little small on her but can't fit the right way.  Most of the time the pants don't stay up on her and her underwear shows every time.  They just immediately fall down when she puts them on.  No matter what pants she wears, when she sits down, a couple inches of her underwear shows.  Belts don't help sometimes because she doesn't have much of a butt to hold them up.  I am not sure what to do in this situation.  Any suggestions?

Alright I have the completion of Wednesday Adams (white), and I'll be going on a cruise in a couple of months. I have never attempted to tan considering I get burned easily and know all of the dangers with UV exposure, and I'm worried that I'll get severely burned on the cruise to the point I won't enjoy it. Yes I know you can keep putting sunblock on, but if your me then you loose track of the time... A LOT! So I'm considering tanning to slowly expose my skin to the UV sol I won't be burned that bad, (ps. it's freezing and dark where I live) but I don't know how early I should start tanning before the cruise, what products to use, or how long I need to tan.       PLEASE!!!! Do not lecture me on how bad tanning is! I know, I'm only considering it due to the cruise... I like being pale, but the sun doesn't!!!

Hello All      I want to get laser/Light permanent hair removal treatment, but I really don't know which clinic or whats best. I have done loads of research i know of many different treatments and clinics and I believe myself to be a good candidate. However, How can a non surgical procedure cost so much flippin money and which is not quaranteed!! I could have laser eye surgery get brilliant vision for half the price of a full course of laser treatments which an infant could admininister!!      This weekend i went to the Harvey Medical Clinic and they asked do you have a girlfriend, does this effect your confidence, are you in the right frame of mind (obviously playing on my insecurity) They then tell me i'm ideal and that we would expect 70+ percent reduction. Can we book you in!?? You pay 550 now and then 1000 on first appointment for 6 sessions. I then ask if i pay this amount what can you commit to, if i'm ideal then will i see 70 percent less hair, she replies "a reduction the hair will be finer, but you could be one of the few that losers all hair"      NOW CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG but am i asking for laser hair thinning?? So is there anyone in this community who has had laser removal and they can confirm it works. Preferably Male and has a hairy back :)      Many thanks Rant over

I thought it was almost healed, so last night I used a wax strip on my upper lip area, and it felt tingly so I immediately put on neoporin so that it wouldn't scar again.       This morning the two scars are pink. Does that mean they're going to reform or does it mean it's healing? (When I put neosporn on them this morning they burned for a minute or two).

20090222221544AALXCaJ	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	When did scarves become so popular?	I've noticed during the latest Winter season that both Men and Women (and kids alike) are sporting scarves of different colors to go with every outfit. I like it....I wonder if it is a trend that will stick around or something that was brought on by popular culture.        Really nice scarves are somewhat pricey but they add character to your outfit.

At the same time if I want to get dressed up to go out with my husband there is a possibility to do something with it. It's naturally wavy, not curly, but wavy. I have an oval shaped face, and no bangs at the moment. Can anyone suggest a cut/style that would be easy to do and maintain but won't make me look too much older than I am (I'm 23). Sending a link to a picture would be helpful too if anyone could do that! Thank you!

20090223065646AAxB9mn	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Guys, answer this question about underwear?	Just feedback from guys please (about high school age)   If there wasn't any propaganda about how lame briefs underwear is, or how boxers are "cooler" to wear, if you wouldn't get "made fun of", if girls didn't care, and if there wasn't the rumor about how briefs lower sperm count, would you wear tighty whities? If not white, at least briefs in general? Styles are changing once again and wearing briefs is actually becoming more popular worn by skateboarders, famous athletes, and actors.  Wearing boxers is becoming the "lame" and "uncool" thing to wear, such as hanging with your buddies.

This pic is the closest description I can find...But the cut i want is shorter, right at the shoulders, it slants from the back (shorter in the back and longer in the front but only slightly..), the "bang" part is how I want it =) Also I would use a shiny hair product :]    So to see if it would work..you need a description of my hair..   - it's dark brown, a little below my shoulders (I'd cut it obviously)   - It's curly, and i can sometimes control it (I would straighten my hair, or i could wear it curly and straighten only the bang)   - My hair is really thick (So i would thin it out when i got the cut)   - My face is heart shaped/oval       So please tell me if you think this cut is nice and if it would go well with my face =) thanks!

I never had any bleeding or anything like that. A couple days ago I went to get a haircut and the woman that was cutting my hair accidentally pulled my piercing with her comb. I had a little bit of bleeding at that moment and it did hurt. So every time I clean my piercing now, I see a tiny bit of discharge like yellowish blood or something. I never had this before and I was wondering if there is something special I need to do apart from keep cleaning it twice a day with warm saltwater. Thank you

My sister in law and I are pretty competitive when we come to most things, generally good fun, and we often give each other challenges to do with clothes, loser pays a forfeit. This time we got a bit silly and we bet each other to wear an item of underwear to replace what we normally wear under trousers or skirts - if one of us fails, we have to take our husband out to watch football for a month (we both hate it). I found the tinyest g-string I could find thinking this would be best and most embarrassing. She has managed to better me though and found a big crinoline underskirt. It is 33 inches long and very, very full. It is not what I was expecting and I don't have skirts or dresses that big that I could wear in the day. I wouldn't even know where to look.      Does anyone know what I could wear that wouldn't look totally ridiculous and where I could get it from? Pictures would help!   Thanks.
20090223065951AAUEvO2	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	How to solve problem of extremely chapped lips?	I have and have always had extremely, embarrassingly chapped lips. They also are large lips, so when they are cracked and flaky it is very noticeable to others as well as painful and distracting to me. Sometimes they are so bad that they split and bleed while talking or eating. It is rather bothersome.      This weekend is my birthday and I am taking a trip to see some friends I haven't seen in about two years. I have lost a lot of weight and made a lot of headway in life, so I am really looking forward to strutting my stuff. However, the whole chapped lip thing is sort of blowing it for me. So what can I do by this weekend to have my lips looking as good as the rest of me?      Burt's Bees and various medicated chap sticks and lip moisturizers don't seem to be doing the trick. The only thing that has ever worked is breaking open vitamin E capsules and smearing the contents on my lips with a cosmetic sponge. That's great but hardly handy enough to take out on the town in my purse and touch up throughout the night. So, any suggestions from other chapped lip sufferers with any success?

20090223070924AAJvsVH	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Not sure what's going on with my piercing?	I got my belly button pierced last June, almost 9 months ago, and it healed very well. I changed it a while back to a gold ring, and it still took and healed fine. I wash daily with liquid Dial soap and don't play with the jewelry. For some reason, the skin around the jewelry has been really dry. I used to use baby oil after showering, and some might have got around the piercing to keep the skin soft, but I recently stopped. It doesn't hurt, nor is it abnormally red, just really dry. Also, how can I tell if my body is rejecting the ring? I haven't noticed it moving any since the swelling reduced back in July, but the skin seems thin, not so thin that I feel like it's migrating, but thin like it was a shallow piercing (I also learned later on that the piercer I went to wasn't the best, so it could have been a mistake on their behalf). Can anyone give me ideas as to what's wrong? If anything?
