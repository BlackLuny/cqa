20090203133706AAfQmWC	Health;Alternative Medicine	Legal herbs (in USA) for headaches?	I have chronic headaches -- every single day.  Things that work moderately well I no longer have access to (vicodin, fioricet), and I've been maxing out on ibuprofen and acetaminophen for months.  I've tried acupressure, self-hypnosis / meditation, a barrage of herbal remedies, homeopathic medicines, restricting my diet, and exercise to no avail.      I can't go to a doctor because I don't have the money anymore (due to lost work due to the headaches) and I make too much money for the state to help.      I was just trying to preemptively counter any suggestions that I've tried.        What I'm looking for: some herb, which is legal in the USA, which I can buy online (or locally) which may give me some relief from muscle-tension headaches (as per the neurologist at my last visit).       It doesn't have to be super-strong, but as effective as a couple of small vicodin (5mg) or fioricet (50mg) would be great.        Any suggestions / help is greatly appreciated.  Also, if you have any low-cost suggestions for stress headache relief that I haven't mentioned -- I welcome those suggestions as well.      Thanks.

Can anyone	I recently had a vaginal hysterectomy to remove my uterus which was believed have Adenomyosis. My doctor said I should feel an immediate relief from the chronic pelvic pain I had been having for the last year, unfortunately the pain is worse now than before. I also was told that I should have very minimal, watered down bloody spotting and actually had what I would liken to a heavy period for the last two weeks. That subsided a few days ago and then all of the sudden I had a gush of blood and the passing of what looked like a blood clot and my pain became even more intense. I am also experiencing very pain ful bowel movements along with all the rest of this. Can anyone help me try to figure out what is going on? I see my doctor in a couple of days, however, I would like any help I can get? Thanks.

20090105110446AA0gMH1	Health;Other - Health	Possible Digestive system problem? *Repost*?	I think I might have a digestive system problem, but it could be something else. I really have no idea. My weight fluctuates between 130 and 140 constantly. I have gas a lot (and sometimes when I burp I throw up a little). It's normal for me to not poop for a week and then I might get diarrhea. I also think I have a slow metabolism. I can eat one small meal in a day, say 1000 calories including everything, and gain 5 pounds. I sporadically get severe chest pain and pressure. I have muscle spasms/twitches sometimes. I have trouble sleeping and getting to sleep. I sometimes get nauseated.      I went to a doctor not too long ago who thought it was sinuses and acid reflux, and he gave me an antibiotic and nexium, neither of which helped.      Last time I posted this, I got 2 interesting answers.       1.I agree with the anxiety disorder opinion ... When we sometimes feel our lives are out of control we can "take control" with symptoms, etc. and can also gain attention from others through this.      Are you able to seek counselling and tell them the same as you have stated here. They will be able to help you pinpoint the roots of this & how to help relieve yourself of the controlling anxiety you experience.       Best of luck, you can do it:)      AND      2.had the same thing and had it for a year before I had terrible chest pain,I thought I was having a heart attack,turns out my gallbladder needed to be removed..there was gravel and sludge in it..a simple ultrasound will tell you if that is it.I had all the symptoms you had..and I also (not to sound gross) had a hard time going #2..and sometimes when I did,it was a bright light brown color.The doctor told me that is because of my gallbladder needing to be removed.The surgery was like 40 minutes and I was home that same day and up and back to work in 1 week..and I feel so much better..have them do an ultrasound for that!               I was wondering if anyone else had another suggestion, or do you agree/disagree with either of these other opinions?

20080625072232AA2WZM2	Health;Mental Health	è favolosa....leggete?	La scena che segue si è svolta sul volo della compagnia British    Airways tra Johannersburg e Londra.       Una donna bianca, di circa 50 anni, prende posto in classe economica    di fianco ad un nero. Visibilmente turbata, chiama la hostess'       'Che problema c'è signora?' chiede l'hostess.    'Ma non lo vede?' risponde la signora 'mi avete messo a fianco di un    nero. Non sopporto di rimanere qui. Assegnatemi un altro posto'.       'Per favore, si calmi' dice l'hostess 'perchè tutti i posti sono    occupati. Vado a vedere se ce n'è uno disponibile'.       L'hostess si allontana e ritorna qualche minuto più tardi.       'Signora, come pensavo, non c'è nessun altro posto libero in classe   economica. Ho parlato col comandante e mi ha confermato che non c'è    nessun posto neanche in classe executive. Ci è rimasto libero soltanto un    posto in prima classe.'      Prima che la donna avesse modo di commentare la cosa, l'hostess    continua: 'Vede, e' insolito per la nostra compagnia permettere a una persona    con biglietto di classe economica di sedersi in prima classe. Ma, viste    le circostanze, il comandante pensa che sarebbe scandaloso obbligare    qualcuno a sedersi a fianco di una persona sgradevole'.       ...E, rivolgendosi al nero, l'hostess prosegue: 'Quindi, signore, se lo desidera,    prenda il suo bagaglio a mano, che un posto in prima classe la attende...'    E tutti i passeggeri vicini,che ,allibiti,avevano assistito alla    scenata della signora, si sono alzati applaudendo.

So I have High-Functioning Autism, though no one would know I have it unless I told them, but they would notice I act different from the average person, but that's not the point.      So I am 19, and never have had a relationship of any kind (boyfriend-wise). And I want to know if there are other people like me, and if there is a way to over come it and be able to form relationships.       I seem to either like guys who don't like me back, but the ones who do don't like me for very long. Like it's something I'm doing wrong. And I heard that many Autistics deal with the same thing that I do, with not being able to get into such relationships.

However, I mean that i am just hungry ALL the time, even before I started workingout i was like this.   I would just like some help losing weight- please dont suggest the "1 cup of water before every meal" meathod. Thanks.

A couple years ago i started to always be paranoid, always thinking people are talking to me, feeling embarrassed about everything. i feel I dont understand as much anymore, like everyone is not telling me something important. I feel depressed, my body feels depressed as well, as if I dont have energy anymore, I just lay down and daydream. Activities are not the same as they used to be, i dont want to play or go outside. I recently gained 30 lbs in 3 years. I always talk to myself in my mind and music is always stuck in my head, certain tunes make me play it in my mind all day. Whats wrong with me and what are similar disorders that might relate to me? I visited a doctor and she thinks I just need sleep and gives me sleep aid and something for seratonium or w/e. I changed psychiatrist twice and they dont seem to know what im going through, they are a bit rude. Thanks for any help.

It concerns me more that I actually want to have a disorder. I feel like then, I don't have to blame myself for feeling this way, that it's not my fault.      I just don't know if the emotions I feel are normal. I have always just accepted it as my personality. I am tired of feeling this way though.      I feel numb sometimes. I can never stay happy for more than perhaps half an hour, an hour. My moods changes radically. I do become very angry or depressed when it comes to rejection from others. I do see people as good or evil. There is one person that I constantly change my opinions about but maybe it's just because of his own personality.       I feel empty, numb, sad, alone, insecure, negative, helpless.       I have been feeling this way for about two years. I just always accepted it. I just want to be happy now. I constantly needs praise and attention, I need to be loved or I get sad.

It does get in my way of the things I am doing. Of course, when I am with other people I try to hold/push it back in. But what bothers me is, that when I push it in, it still makes a noise! Why does this happen?      Also why do I let out so much gas? I eat normally (usually a bread for breakfast with decaf tea, a sandwich for lunch, and then it depends for dinner. I don't drink milk cause I am lactose intolerant so I drink lactaid milk, as well as I don't eat foods/sweets with milk). I do eat an apple and a banana each day, and drink chamomile tea every night. I take Nexium pills every morning for my stomach.      I don't understand why I have so much gas, but sometimes it really bothers me. When I try to push it back in, it sometimes make a noise, and I feel embarassed.       What should I do? Does anyone else has this problem too?

Well, this time last year I did have anorexia; but I got intervention before I could really get to bad.  But now, my mum thinks I have it again and she's getting really paranoid.   I've been loosing weight recently, but I've also been eating more.  I've started exercising to try and get fitter because the weight I do have is pretty much all in fat, and I want a little muscle.   I've been eating healthier too, I'm vegetarian but I've been eating a healthy diet with foods with protein and stuff, not like the shi*ty tv dinners I ate when I was getting over my disorder.   But last night, my mum freaked out.  She saw my ribs sticking out when I was wearing a bikini and thinks that I have anorexia again.  I do not think I am fat, I am average weight and I am happy with that.  I eat healthy foods and exercise and for that, she thinks I have anorexia.  Does anyone have any ideas to convince her otherwise?

I noticed that I always see stuff floating about and I thought it was normal but I looked up what I saw and the closest thing I could find was people talking about their experiences on hallucinogens, eek!  Anyhow here's what I see 24/7:   |   -Moving color trails and patterns behind closed and open eyes (more noticeable when closed but that's just because I'm so used to just ignoring it).   |   Floors, walls, ceiling, and other flat planes seem to be waving/rippling or as I read elsewhere "breathing".   |   If I look at floors, blankets, and most often anything with a wood grain faces will start to appear, not usually human but of strange animals and stuff  (I'm assuming this is just my imagination running amok)   |   That's about it, is this normal, or at least relatively normal haha.  I'm just curious and not worried as it hasn't really affected my everyday living.
20090203140447AACR8XQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Is E, nodosome connected to Celiac disease?	I have had chronic Erythema nodosome for 30 years but it hasn't bothered me much during the past 2 years.  3 years ago I was diagnosed as having Celiac disease. For the past half a year the symptoms of Celiac disease have been extreme.  (I'm a roll a day girl)  Now the E. nodosome has returned with a vengence.  I have never experienced the typical dime to quarter size patch of inflammation I read about on the internet -rather it's usually an area about 6 inches across, is flaming red, tight  and feels quite deep - deep enough to tighten the muscles making it very painful to even lift my feet.  They are presenting on the fronts of my legs, which is most commonly what happens.  My question is - are the 2 symptoms related?  I have recently seen associations cited for Chrone's disease.  My Dr. is reluctant to rescope as he feels I have a working diagnosis and we should go with those test results for another 4 years.  Between the 2 problems, I'm not having much fun at all.  Please help if you can, suggesting treatment that might alleviate this.  I was prescribed Lugol's solution, but have to admint I never actually used it because of the staining properties - I had just spent thousands on dental work - and the skull and crossbones on the jar.  I was afraid of it.   I am taking an international flight in a month and want to know if support stockings are recommended as well.  Although this is a condition of the fatty tissue, it feels like vericose veins (ropey) and I would like some assurance that there is no connection to thrombosis.  Thanks.

Now he tells me that he's gonna have to keep an eye on me, he follows me wherever I go, he screens my phone calls and sits especially close to me if we go out, when before ( when I was fatter ) would sit as far away from me as possible he would even at times leave me alone at the table for more than 30 minutes.

20090224231220AABtaUB	Health;Mental Health	I hate sleep? How to fix it?	Let me start first by saying that I'm not an insomniac by definition. If I go to bed, I usually fall asleep within an hour and sleep through to the morning.      But I hate doing it.      I hate the feeling of waking up, the sense of wasting time as I actually go to bed, etc. The entire process seems like a waste to me, even though I know I technically need it. The more I think about it being time for me to go to bed, the more things I start to do and I even write out lists of potential things to accomplish, like I suddenly get ridiculously motivated. I try to push these things off to the morning because like I said, I know I need to sleep, but then when I wake I just feel terrible, lazy, and lethargic again.      I'm pretty sure this isn't normal. Could it be a sign of a deeper problem? What do I do? What do I try?      For the record, exhaustion shouldn't be my problem. I work out on a regular basis at my local gym and have a full time job.

20090225011443AA5Tua5	Health;Dental	Severe tooth, jaw, ear pain after seeing dentist!! HELP PLEASE!?	I had two cavities that needed filled.  One tooth, the cavity covered over half my tooth. When my mouth wasn't numb anymore a few hours later, the tooth that had the big filling put it, was hurting VERY badly.  I ended up waiting 6 days (I'm not sure how).  I had to take excederine every 6 hours.  The dentist said the filling was probably too close to the root and was killing the root.  They went ahead and did a root canal.  Same thing.  As soon as the numbing wore off, same exact piercing constant pain.  I can't even touch the tooth, bite down,.. and it hurts extremely badly if I don't take medicine.  It hurts up to my ear.  I went in again and had more xrays done.  He said the root canal looks great, but the small cavity next to it that was replaced looks like it has a small hole in the filling.  So, they re-did that for me in case that was causing me the pain (but that tooth wasn't the tooth hurting me). He also gave me antibiotics.  As soon as the numbing wore off from them re-doing the filling, the same pain came back. It's been a week and a half and I can't take it anymore! I don't know what to do.. and neither does he! Any ideas??? HELP PLEASE!

20090225015049AAH1BtZ	Health;Mental Health	What should I do about this recently-resurfaced childhood memory?	I have depression most of the time. It stretches as far back as I can remember, and only recently I realised it wasn't normal. A memory surfaced from early childhood that may have caused it. It involved one adult and things for which adults could go to jail.   But now, I don't know what to do. I would really like to stop feeling depressed all the time, but I don't think going to a psychologist or psychiatrist could help. I have been to those before, and I came to the conclusion that talking about things that were wrong in my life just made them worse, not better. Now that I may have identified the cause, does anyone have any ideas on what I could do not to feel this way all of the time?
20090225015122AATvZLi	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Low blood pressure problems and serious effects?	Well, for about a little less than a year now  I've had problems with starting to blackout/faint. It seems to only happen when I stand up. What happens is I lose control of my balance, can barely see anything as it goes black, and my hearing becomes blocked. It hasn't become worse till recently. Before you ask, I am a teen and will hopefully be seeing a doctor soon. But my aunt recently linked my problem with low blood pressure (we have something that checks it). When I'm sitting it's pretty normal, but when I'm standing it's a huge jump. My pulse also seems to increase. Has anyone else had these problems? Any suggestions? I've come close to falling and hitting my head on our table before and I have little control when it goes black. It's really starting to get me worried and my parents as well.

20090225020655AAqpwd2	Health;Dental	Advice-What Do I Do Re: Dentist?	What Do I Do?         Around eight months ago I had a white filling.  And I was pleased with it.     However over the last few months I have been getting occasional pain from this filling when eating on this particular side (right molar)         Also when having a hot drink and it goes over the tooth it gives a sharp pain.    And I know what people are thinking…its just sensitivity!         But is it?       I went to see the dentist about six weeks ago and I do remember him scraping this particular tooth with his implement.    And I know that that is the norm but does anyone think that he might have been scraping this particular tooth so that he has got to re-fill this tooth at a later date? Hence more profit for him!        I have already told him sometime ago that he was too money orientated (which most dentists are) this was after he pi**ed me off!      Do fillings have like a twelve month guarantee?    Because this filling is less than twelve months old.      Any advice appreciated!  Thanks

20090225023201AAmie6l	Health;Mental Health	I have an unusual form of OCD, And i'm not sure how to deal with it, what do i do?	I've had this form of OCD my entire life, And i'm 17 now, And its only recently (and by chance) that i discovered what i have.      though figuring out that i more then likely have OCD rather then being "Just plain crazy" gave me a lot of relief, i really don't know where to go from here.      My form of OCD causes me to build a tremendous amount of guilt over trivial and minor things unless i tell my mom about it. It sounds weird, but its nearly impossible to deal with. However minor, or gross, or irrelevent the issue is, i have to tell her about it, or the guilt continues to plauge me.      Even through all this my mom just said it was puberty and that it would go away overtime, i'm 17 now, and i still have it, and its only after doing some research did i realize that this almost perfectly fits the description of OCD.      I have other strange compulsions such as having to say "No" whenever i think a bad thought, tracing objects with my eyes, and some other issues.      I also have a strange issue which i don't think is connected to OCD, I constantly feel like i'm falling, even when i'm standing or sitting in place, And its been frustrating to deal with. The best way i can describe this feeling is, Imagine being on a small boat in the middle of the ocean with a hurricane. That up-and-down feeling has been with me for a while, And i did some reseach and i'm mostly sure its vertigo.      I talked with my mom, And though it was hard to convince her, since even through all this, she still thinks its just puberty, she arranged for me to me with a psychiatrist and a doctor (For my dizzyness), so i'm glad that was done.      But other then that, i don't really know what to do or how to combat this. What also makes it so difficult is the fact that i'm homeschooled, and in my area, There are absolutely no homeschooling programs or groups of any kind.      And to top it all off, I have college coming up pretty soon, And my OCD/vertigo, combined with lazyness, has prevented me from really studying to prepare for it. I really do not want to go on medication and have to deal with sideeffects while going into a school for the first time in a decade. I'm just so overwhelmed, i don't know what to do and where to start...

Will it grow over the rest of my gum or drop off? It feels all inflamed at the moment and am worried it may be infected again.

I find that I'm overthinking and my face scrunches up sometimes clenching my teeth. I also get hungry and noticed I'm losing my sex drive (Im only 19). I think I suffer from social anxiety. I'm messing up in school and starting to lose friends. I quit drugs as of today. I'd admit I have problems but I don't feel like seeing a doctor. What do you suggest I should do about my lifestyle?

I showed him to 6 paediatrician & 1 Surgeon but nobody could find out what it is. and i gave him 3 different antibiotics (Total 30 days) as prescribed by the different doctors. At last i took him to Gastroentologist and they did COLONOSCOPY test for him and found out some small pimples & inflamation inside his stomach. Doctor said it can be LACTOSE MILK ALLERGY and advised us to give Lactose free Milk (SOYA MILK) And the doctor gave medicine for the digestion and vitamins. My son is now 7 months old and still there is Mucus whenever he passes stool but NO BLOOD. again i want to sent his stool for test. may be in next week. I will keep you updated. I am still confused.
