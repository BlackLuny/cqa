20090303230352AAfuXzc	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Where does all the rubber go?  (Longtime passing...)?	Nope, not going to sing.  But consider this: There are literally millions of cars and trucks on the 5.7 million miles of paved roads in the U.S.      Each tire on each car wears down as more miles are driven.  Tires last anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 miles depending on how much you pay for them.  What wears off the tires is, of course, the rubber.  But other than skid marks here and there, we don't see piles of rubber dust along our roads, do we?      So, this begs the question: Where does all the rubber go?      C'mon, do a little brainwork and give me an answer.  If I like it, I'll give you 10 points and a gold star for your forehead.  :o)      Road miles source:  http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_miles...

20090304070436AAbkRAr	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Honda Standard/Cruiser Motorcycle Questions!?	Please only answer if you've had experience with these bikes!      I've never owned a bike before and I'm taking the safety course in April.  I'm 6'0, 220 lbs.  I've been doing a little research and I've narrowed it down to three bikes.  The Honda Rebel, Shadow VLX600, and Nighthawk.  I wanted to know if either the Rebel or Nighthawk came with a bigger than 250cc engine.  I don't want to go any bigger than a 600, but I'm afraid that if I buy a 250, that I'll outgrow it too quickly.  I eventually also want to be able to have someone else on the bike when I feel completely comfortable riding on my own.  Also, out of those three bikes, which would probably be the best for someone my size?        I know that's a lot but I appreciate your help!

Nothing is really wrong with it other than its green and the 4th gear doesn't work. Other than that its a good running truck. I have no insurance on it until thursday. But, heres the deal, I suppose to save 100 dollars a week and save up until june to acquire enouch cash along with my 2000 and my other 600 dollars in the bank already. When this happens ofcourse at the end of june my dad comes up from mississippi to help me buy a car. Not a new one ofcourse but a good running car.      Now here is my question. Should I tell dad to just forget about it, and i'll just keep my truck instead. Because having a trail bike and a truck is better than just a car and a truck. Do you see where im getting at. Why would I trade my truck for 1200 dollars when theres already 3200 dollars in it, When I can just keep it and buy a trail bike for 4000 dollars, 2300 down payment and the rest on insurance every month for both vehicles as in the truck and the motorcyle. I just think it would be funner to just have both where I can drive both on the road when I want and dont need to deal with 2 vehicles that I would or could own in june.

20090227062442AARAXEU	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Need advice on whether to buy another car (details below)?	I have a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu LS with almost 175,000 miles on it. I've had it since November 2000.  Besides the gas mileage being somewhat subpar (my mechanic has checked everything and doesn't see a reason why that is so), the car runs great.  Engine is strong, transmission is strong, it has original alternator.  Besides routine maintenance (oil, brakes, tune-ups, fluids, etc),  the only thing I've had done is a water pump replacement at 160,000 miles.      At any rate, my brother-in-law is selling his wife's car (it's a Hyundai).  It has about 30,000 miles on it and has a 100,000 mile warranty.        We have a decision to make.  Should we keep our current car until it breaks down for good and only pay the liability like we've been doing, or sell our current car and buy the Hyundai?  This will most likely set us back about $450 a month (monthly car payment and insurance costs) should we do this.  Also, we would have to get a loan from our credit union.      What would you do?  Is this is a case of "if it's not broke, don't fix it"?      (It should also be of note that we have some lady friends very interested in buying our current vehicle because their SUV is about to bite the dust.)

20090304071944AAerEhf	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Volkswagen	Whats a good VW web site for classic VW's info?	Hey I am in the process of restoring a 1971 VW super beetle. I was a mechanic for almost 9 yrs and used to have a 1980  camaro that I totally redid from the ground up so I do have plenty of experience with cars, not just a shade tree mechanic. However, this is my first go around with a VW.  They seem to be really easy to work on for the most part but I'm still not real sure what I want to do with the car. I'm thinking maybe just a quick and fun little street car because making it a full out drag car just doesnt fit the budget right now.  Can anyone give me any useful info or useful websites where I can bounce some ideas off of people or maybe just get some hints and tips. Maybe some kind of web site dedicated to classic VW's where people can post stuff regularly. Also anyone on answers that has experience with classic VW's please shoot me an e-mail I would love to talk to others who can help me in any way shape or form. Let me go ahead and say thanks ahead of time for all the great answers that i know you people will give.

20090304072120AATydY1	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	My car keeps being vandalized and I've had enough.  What to do?	I asked about something similar before, but now things have stepped up too far.      My car has been egged twice: easy enough to clean up when it's not hot or sunny and you're in the damp hours of 4/5am.      Now my driver's-front window has been broken.  They smacked it just hard enough to leave the window shattered but still intact.      I'm taking photos before I break the rest of it so I can pull it into the driveway.      What I want to know is:   -How can I catch the people doing this?   -What legal action can we take against them when we find them?   -How can I prevent this from happening anymore?  It's a '99 Grand Am and I don't leave anything lying out on the seats, so it's not really a target.  I don't have any enemies in the area (that I know of).      What should I do?
20090304072408AAuZKiS	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Car audio speaker experts - what is the REAL difference in SQ vs. price on mids and highs?	I have an Audio Art 340.6XE amp, a killer SQ (sound quality) amp. Runs about 70W per channel, and can be bumped even higher @ 14.4V and bridged.      My question is about speakers. I like to crank it LOUD, to the point of not being able to take it anymore, but short of ear bleeding.       I am looking at two levels of speakers. One level is the approx. $300 range for a set of mids and highs. Examples would be...      JL Audio C5 series   Focal 165KF K2 power series   Boston Pro 60 SE      The next level is the $500 and up range. Examples being       JL Audio ZR650 Series   Focal 165K2P K2 Power series   Boston Pro SPZ60 Series      The difference in these 2 levels is mostly material used for the cone, and wattage they can handle. The cheaper ones average about 70W RMS and the expensive ones average 150W RMS, which is double.       Assuming I want to turn the gain all the way up on the amp, will there be a noticable difference in SQ and SPL between the 2 levels, and is it really worth spending double if so?       This is not for competetion, just cruising. Thanks

PLEASE HELP!?	my 97 honda civic ex [its a 5 speed] is making a weird noise when i start to accelerate from a stop while making a turn. [example] sitting at a red light, turning right on red, when i turn and accelerate there is a knocking noise coming from the front end of the car, but when i get into the lane that i was turning into, after making the turn, it stops knocking.   its kind of a loud knocking, i know that if you were standing outside of the car it would be able to be heard.   i also know what 'knock and ping' sounds like and i know its not that.   could it be low power stearing fluid? or any other fluid that needs to be changed?   it doesnt knock when i just accelerate and then go straight, only when i accelerate and make a turn. and i dont think i have ever heard it when im driving, slowing down to like, 10 or 15mph and then turning onto another street or something.      does anyone know what it could be? help me out!

She was just abit annoyed understandably trying to make me sign on the side of the road it was my fault, I refused.

There was nothing signed or agreed upon in regards to when or how it would be paid back, only me saying to him, I will pay you back.  Anyways that is the situation.  He emailed me today asking when this would be paid and if not he would contact his lawyers to apply a lien on my vehicle.  Since he paid off my fine and we only verbally agreed on me paying him back, does he have a legal right to apply a lien to my vehicle?      ps.   I will stress that this was him doing this to be nice and to make the sale, nothing was documented or signed etc.  I am going to pay it back, but I was taken back by the email.      Thanks!

20090304103526AAGUEeL	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	My car got towed! How to fight the towing company?	Two days ago, we had a huge snow storm with over 6 inches of snow. I parked on a visitors parking spot where I always park but because of the snow I did not see that half of my car was parked over a fire lane. I dont know how the tow truck knew that since everything was covered in snow but my car got towed because it was parked over a fire lane.    I think that this is very unfair. I had the pay the fee to get my car out since they charge extra for storage fees.  I want to fight it because i think its very unfair. What can I do? and what should I do to try to fight this towing charge? I am a college students and $125 is what I have to spend a month.

20090304112020AAsHyus	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	I was in a car accident that was not my fault and he is self insured?	I was in a car accident that was not my fault and the other driver is "self Insured"  he was driving a rental.  I called the rental company and they stated that he has what is called "NJ EXCHANGE"  I called this company and what this means is that he has collateral such as "money in the bank" and he is not entitled to carry insurance.  So if I put this through my insurance I have to pay a deductible and my rate will go up.  Do I have other options?  I called my insurance and they stated that I could sue him personally, and collect for the damages or put it through them and pay the deductible and they will sue him.  Once they sue and recover the amount owed then I will receive my deductible back.  Well I dont want this accident on my record since it was NOT my fault and he did not have insurance.  I do have a police report and all proper papers.  The thing is I am planning on moving out of state (1300 miles away) in about 2 months.  I am so lost as what to do...Please all info and respectful thoughts appreciated...

Well, I have a 2003 Kawasaki KFX400 and every time i ride it i let it warm up really good and i go easy at first but once i start riding for 20-30 minutes it starts bogging when i hit the throttle regardless of the gear, and it backfires CONSTANTLY. I am a 110 pound 13 year old so i know it is not a size issue or that i am beating on it however my father is not home enough to help maintain the quad. I have come up with four theories. 1- Carburetor is dirty. 2-Spark Plugs gotta get changed. 3- Air Filter is dirty. or 4- it is something over my head and I should just bring it to Chaplin Kawasaki... You tell me if you know your stuff please!!!
