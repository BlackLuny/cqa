20070101093005AAyfZoA	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (Italy)	Secondo voi la Juve merita di stare in B?	Secondo me...SI. Perchè ci sono squadre, tipo la mia amata Roma, che quando erano in forte crisi si sono riprese con le loro forze. La Juve ha preferito corrompere a destra e a sinistra. Non me la prendo con i giocatori (o almeno, non con tutti) ma con chi della Juve ha contribuito a levare senso al calcio italiano.   Altro che B, sarebbe stata molto più giusta la C2 u_u

20070117135737AAs6Avc	Sports;Wrestling	It's time for another addition of Rate that Superstar!?	This time we will be rating Samoa Joe, I give him an 9.5 because he has excellent brawling skills, amazing technical skills, brilliant mic work, tons of charisma, and for a big guy he isn't afraid of going to the top rope, not to mention that he was undefeated for more than a year in two different wrestling federations at different times, which shows that even the bookers knew how great he was since the beggining.  Samoa Joe is by far not my favorite wrestler, but I still can recognise his greatness.  Also, if you answer this question with a response that shows me that you hardly even know who Samoa Joe is besides maybe 5 seconds worth of seeing him on a commercial I will debate you on it or maybe even delete your answer.  This question is intended for wrestling fans who watch both TNA and WWE not people who have daily arguments saying "TNA sucks, no WWE sucks"

20070118175930AA7XK1i	Sports;Wrestling	Some Carlito news?	For you people who want to say "I don't know how to answer this" it's not a question, just more info:      Word from WWE is that Carlito will remain in his current mid-card position until he decides to step up and show that he really cares about the business. The big criticism recently is that he was unhappy being put in the puppy-love storyline with Torrie Wilson and thus he hasn't been trying to hard as of late. The other problem according to those in the know is that the babyface character he is playing now is completely the opposite of how he is in real life, and that he's a natural heel who in some ways is being held down by a character that it's basically impossible for him to play.

20070123100440AAQsPx7	Sports;Wrestling	Who is glad to see Test get the push he deserves?	The ECW title, sad to say, doesnt have as much prestige to it like it used to.  However, I was always a fan of Test and felt like he deserved a push in the rankings.  I would like him back in IC contention like he was before and eventually in the heavyweight title contention.  If you watch his matches, look at his new mic skills, and overall fan reaction (they really hate him) then you will see he deserves the push.
20070212143737AAc9sM2	Sports;Wrestling	The little wrestling fans are posing?  Why?	I just answered a question about the steiner brothers and their career.  It asked about their talent up to 1994 and I realized that a young fan above me who is 13 answered the question about the technical ability and wrestling ability from their matches.  Their have been no videos or dvd's dedicated to describing the steiner bros. wrestling ability in their matches, yet this girl who literally came into the world the same year the steiners broke up feels like she can talk about something that she knows nothing about.  This isn't the first time younger fans have done this.  I actually had some kid say that Bob Backlund never proved anything in his career.  Why do MANY, but not all, of the younger fans feel like they should be able to speak badly about wrestlers when they werent even alive and able to see them wrestle?

I love him-He uses steroids to become a tank and is loved by all female fans   He never backs down-Thats just a storyline cos wwe are trying to sell him as a face   He has the best moves-yeah, cos the 3 move wonder of an STF, a firemans drop and a punch to the face is a great arsenal, sarcasm!   Alot of ppl like him-most of his cheers are edited in for TV, its never like that at the arena. He geets boo'd.   He can rap/is a gangster etc- Correction, he WAS a rapping gangster. Now he has won the title, he lost his personality. Thuganomics, rapping and "word of life" havent been used for over a year.   He's the champ-only cos wwe are trying to give him a push. He did nothing to deserve it, as legends like Rock and Foley worked for years for that title.

Heres the news:  The Current plan in which this idea was thought of by Dusty Rhodes was the ECW will expect to have a ECW tag team title division. This is said to start right directly after Wrestlemaina. Some tag teams that will be in this are gonna be the FBI reforming since Vito currently lost his title down in DSW?. They will be managed by Trinity.  More tag teams will include,Sylvan and Rene Dupree. There has also been talk about having Trevor Murdoch and Lance Cade Join ECW after Wrestlemania to be in the Tag Team Division. And final word was the Dusty Rhodes has already said that the Belts are on there way!    What are your thoughts on this???    I think that the Worlds greatest tag team should move over to ECW to be in it.    ALL OF THIS INFORMATION HAS CAME FROM....... www.rajah.com

After doing my own investigation, I have this to say about the entire so called "KLIQ"   It was designed at behest of HBK shawn michaelsb back in 93.   back in the early 90's Razor was very popular among fans than hbk fastly becoming the rising star, and he was genuine. the real deal.   hbk is white, and he can only do "white things"   so knowing he sucked   he devised a plan along with nash aka diesel(unknowingly but I think he was in on the plan most likely) to secretly get rid of Scott Hall & also sean waltman aka 123kid   hbk akso brought in an enforcer to the group hhh   both hbk & hhh knew they could not compete physically nor so charasmatically as Razor, so they devised a plan to lure him into the kliq and eventually ship him off to WCW as kevin nash as the person in charge to make sure this happened   hbk you are  sour milk compared to scott hall   n your also a bigot   which makes you a limited individual at best   and I wish but only the worst for you from now on

20070227200548AAsFj3f	Sports;Wrestling	Does anyone one else feel "jipped" that Hulk Hogan isnt going to be at Wrestlemania 23?	I feel like I should give up on Vince Mcmahon and the WWE. I have been a life long fan of the WWE and a Hulkamaniac since I was a kid. I've been to many house shows and a couple of Monday Night Raws and Wrestlemania 23 is going to be my first payperview. I am very upset that Hogan isnt going to be at Wrestlemania this year. I mean ive been a fan of the WWE, and Hogan, forever, well in all my 25 years. I've followed it during Hogans era in the 80's, the phony balony New Generation in the 90's, the Attitude era in the late 90's and the recent stuff. I was really hoping to be able to see Hogan in action live before he never wrestles again. I guess that Vince didnt think Hogans services at Wrestlemania were worth the amount of money Hogan rightfully DESERVES!! I just want to hear Hogans theme song, get chills down my spine and see the Hulkster live. Is that too much to ask Vince?

20070506123323AA1fksH	Sports;Baseball	I need to correct my slowpitch softball batting stance....help!!!?	I need help correcting my slowpitch softball batting stance...I am approximately 6' 1" tall and weigh roughly 225lbs....I feel that I should be driving the ball with some authority, though it seems I hit a lot of grounders and pop flys...I haven't played softball in about 3yrs and I'm guessing my batting mechanics are all out of whack...someone please give me some pointers on a good batting stance and technique that will help me drive the ball and get line drive hits, I'm not worried about jacking a softball over a 310 ft fence, I want base hits that will drive in runs, anyone out there have any tips, and also anyone have tips on the proper stance and way to hit to the opposite field so that way I don't become to predictable as we play the same teams in league roughly 3-4 times a season.....I'm open to suggestions, I know a lot of you out there play softball so help me out please

After the agent/lawyer fees and various minor deductions a footballer gets taxed with forbes magazine shows that a footballer with a average career. Like the Jimmy Bulliards, end up making at the end of their 10 year careers as much as a good lawyer or a wealthy doctor overall. A superstar footballer like Fernando Torres or Steven Gerrard end up making at the end of their careers as much as a CEO of a hundred people company. They just make it faster. I much rather have my boy fernando get paid millions to ENTERTAIN ME then some gimp ceo who do nothing for ME.
