YAPEpa5baa	Considering all the people that can't even manage to use that contraption on their large breed dogs - I wouldn't suggest it.    Regular nail clippers work well - unless you want to blow money on the cutsie lil scissors that have a guinea pig on them.  Just be careful not to clip too much and have flour or corn starch ready in case you do cut into the quick.  If you have a piggy with dark/black nails - just do an itty bitty at a time as the quick tends to grow long if you don't keep the nails trimmed.|`|RjyNInW6aa	Get rodent or cat clippers.

kWwgWSSgaa	Phone your local veterinary practise, speak to a vet & ask for a bottle of Metacam pain relief for your Boxer. It will definitely make you Boxer feel more comfortable while she begins to heal from the surgery.    Amongst the breeders/owners/exhibitors of Dobermanns with full tails I know, *NONE* of the dogs have suffered from *any form* of tail damage. This has been the case with my own Dobermann too.    Docking undertaken by a professional/an experienced breeder, when the pup is a few days old would not be harmful or traumatise the pup. However, the cases where people have botched docking a litter and the pups have either died or suffered from infection/needed a second docking, could be one of the reasons the ban was introduced.    Docking was also viewed as largely unnecessary, as the majority of docked dogs {like the Dobermann} do not function in the capacity for which they were originally bred.    I *do not* agree with Blunt Object that the USA is Utopia for dog owners. In England we can exercise our dogs in parks, nature reserves & in castle grounds ect, without being restricted to dog parks. Of the two I would rather have docking that loose that freedom.    I hope you Boxer recovers quickly.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Rubbish! There is no need for any dogs tail to be docked.

Now, your dog gets to suffer because someone thought that a horrible tail injury as an adult was preferable to 20 seconds of minor pain as a puppy. Pretty dumb, eh?    I have seen MANY adult Dobermans that were left natural injure their tails as adults and have to go through tail amputation which is painful and costly. When done properly, a tail dock as a pup is not invasive, not painful and heals quickly and causes the pup minimal pain while a tail injury later causes great stress to the dog. I had one dog that injured her tail that couldn't sit right for weeks!|`|ofUe4hBkaa	i dont get it.  your asking why people dont dock there tails.  then you say you like the look of a natural.  wierd|`|B7ciNw0aaa	Docking is usually done if the dog is a hunting breed- other breeds are done as well, but more for aesthetic reasons than anything else.

I thought it was a purely cosmetic thing and therefore unnecessary but there does seem to be evidence that 10%-15% of "un-docked" Boxers have tail injuries which would not happen if the tail was docked.    As for the pain - see your vet, it seems cruel that you have not been prescibed anything.  Do not give paracetamol without knowing the correct dose, it is a known killer, the effects of which can not be reversed - that is why people take it to commit suicide        http://www.allboxerinfo.com/Tails_-_To_D...|`|AA10327148	Poor baby! If you can't get a good pain reliever from your vet, you can safely ease her trauma by giving her chamomile tea.  Open the teabag, and mix the dry contents in a small amount of a tasty treat, such as canned meat or sardines, etc.(I like to use canned mackerel)  It will just give her a sense of wellbeing, and relax her.  It is a shame that infant docking isn't allowed.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	THANK YOU!    I dont know HOW many questions I have seen parading through here about how docking is "cruel" and then have people rag on ME saying that it is not cruel, and actually is a preventative measure--it exists for a reason!

veDvtYhJaa	Bethany,    You need to understand that pyrs do what's called pre-emptive barking as part of how they do their job.  They guard by intimidating intruders and predators so they won't have to fight them.  Part of how they do this is by the barking.      3/4 of an acre is enough room for the dog.  It gives him room to roam.  He's trying to guard the family and the home.  So, if he hears something that he thinks might be a threat, he'll bark.  Sometimes he'll hear and bark at something you cannot hear.      YOUR job is NOT to tell him simply "NO".  Your job is to train him in good bark / bad bark.  One group member mentioned her dog barked when out on the back porch, constantly, and never obeyed when she told him 'NO'.     The way you train a pyr on good bark / bad bark is to PAY ATTENTION!  When he barks, take a minute to go see what he's barking at.  If you don't see anything, it's safe to assume he heard or smelled something he considered a danger.  Just look at him and ask in a NON-worried voice "is everything ok?" or "did you scare them away?"  If he barks again, then you can tell him "OK, thank you.  That's enough"  Enough is a command you need to train him to let him know to stop what he was doing now.      Once he knows you recognize he's trying to warn you, that you're paying attention and you see no reason to be concerned, he'll stop.  If he continues, then chances are the threat is getting stronger or closer, and you can go out and pet him ask him those questions again.      If you see that he's barking at a squirrel or another dog, it's fine to tell him NO BARK.  But most of the time, he's just trying to warn you of possible danger and he's reassured if you take time to check on his barking and he knows you are aware of his warning to you.      If strangers approach the fence line, he'll probably continue to bark or become more strenuous in his barking, and this is a good thing.  Once the intruder is gone, thank him for warning you.      I don't like using any of the no-bark training collars.  I believe in training in good bark / bad bark is the right way, and letting him know you listen and pay attention to his bark is very important.    ALSO... listen carefully to the barks.  You'll begin to recognize that one bark is "that's a dog" and another is "watch out, there's an intruder", or "here's a delivery person" and so on. -!-|`|MURxMnLtaa	you don't have to get a shock collar, they have spray ones that work on a lot of dogs.|`|nI8G21y8aa	no not a shock  collar. but theres  these high frequency sounds that you can get. and it looks like  abutton/. i'm sorry but i just cant think of the name. and you push the button and it startles the dog and it leared that barking='s an unpleasent sound. they also have spray ones that sprays water on their face when they bark      i hope this helped|`|AA11513519	your dog is most likely barking at other dogs, and thats something you can't change..it comes with the territory.  that particular breed is very territorial.  unfortunately, most people, including you obviously, did not know what you were getting into when you chose the dog you did.  that is part of his makeup, and you will just have to get used to it.  another thing most people don't get, is that dogs live to  be 11 to 18 years old, and just like a kid, you can't just get rid of them when they bother you.  be a responsible dog owner!
IKoxs8sCaa	Its quite normal for them to do the wierd jumpy thing.. I got my two guinea pigs 2 months ago, and I mentioned it to a friend who had them before and she said it was a normal thing and most of hers did it... also with the sneezing thing, one of mine does that too (the same one who jumps!!) and another friend of mine said that was normal, as long as their noses dont look weepy.  Check that her nose is dry and her eyes are clear, and if those are both fine, I really wouldnt worry!  Enjoy her, and dont be scared! x|`|cXK9sY1raa	She is scared of you, and possibly has a respiratory infection, which are very common in guinea pigs and can be fatal if not treated early.

For tips on how to handle and tame your piggie, try here: www.kornage.com|`|RjyNInW6aa	She is just pop-corning. it is typical for a guinea pig to do this if they are scared or excited. I got new babies 34 days ago so I know what you are going through. Why she sneezes though I don't know. If she is a long haired piggie or an Abyssinian she might have a fur ball. She might also be to young to own so she is used to being able to hide under her moms tummy for protection. If you are really worried contact a vet.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	This used to happen to my friends gerbil.

Taste of the wild   EVO   solid gold - barking at the moon  Blue wilderness  Orijen    I have 2 Akita's that have reallllly bad allergies! I have tried every food out there then I started doing my own research and found the best thing for all dogs is grain free and once i started feed grain free my dog are doing great!   My female has an allergy to chicken so that buts out taste of the wild for us but it is one of the top foods! I would recommend that food first to try!   My male was always getting sick and always had the runs! Now he is great he has not been sick in months and no more runs!!! YA!     What natural diet is he on now? just wondering!        99% of vets don't have a  fu** clue what they are talking about when it comes to food! So you own research and see what is out there!

This article covers the 6 major causes:  http://www.dog-health-works.com/lp/dog-w...    As for diet, the first ingredient in his food should be meat or beef.  Don't spare expense on the higher quality formulas.    Have you tried bathing him with a moisturizing or doggy dandruff shampoo?  Sometimes those help.     Adding an air purifier to your home may do the trick as well.  If it's not his diet, it could be a common allergy that's causing the sensative skin.  An air purifier can mitigate the effects of allergies like this.
zAih0Vx5aa	My wife had two babies.    I was furious.    She died too.|`|3n60UxgQaa	Yes.  When they're pregnant, they are under extreme stress.  It's not uncommon for them to give birth and then die, especially if she was in a tank full of males or in a breeder's box.    When she's finished, she'll want to rest.  However, if there are males near by, she's going to get chased and she'll die from exhaustion.    If she's in a breeder's box/net, they stress her out too.  It's a small confined space and it tends to freak a lot of fish out.  (Some of mine tried to jump out and ended up dead or injured.  Never used those again.)    That's why the best thing to do is to give her her own 1+ gallon tank with lots of hiding places. =]|`|IFGSOd16aa	im sorry :( i just lost my pet Alexis she is not a fish she was a rodent. i lost her last night and cried all nightt :(|`|NHs3LxlLaa	Its not normal but it isn't rare.

You can also goggle "Flat Chested Kitten" and a number of websites will come up.|`|viUbPWNTaa	Take your kitten to the vet immediately.    This could be signs of many things, none of them good.    We had a kitten born to a feral mother, we trapped him and his mom and put them into our large cage to work at taming them down.    The day we caught them we took them to the vet for examinations and to have the mother spayed. The vet said they were both in good shape.    About 4 days later, my wife yells for me to come to the backroom - our new cat "guest room"    I get back there and she points out that the kitten was gasping for air and you could see that his lips were blue.    Sharon put him in a carrier and we rushed him to the vet - we had an idea that he might not be coming home with us and so we named him right there.    We would have normally waited to pick a name for him but we both feared that he was not going to survive. We named him Taylor - we had named his mother Carly. (Carly Simon - James Taylor, get it?)    When we got to the vet, I reached in to pull him out of the carrier. He was facing away from the door of the carrier and I slipped my hand underneath him such that his chest was in my palm.    I could feel that his ribs were not correctly shaped.    They were flat, as you describe in your question.    The vet took him to the back area and gave him oxygen. They took x-rays which showed 3 problems.    His rib cage was malformed - they looked it up and came up with a name but I forget it - his diaphragm was herniated, and there was a hole in the sack around his heart, the pericardium.    Any one of them could have been cured but with all 3 he had no chance.    We had euthanize him. Little Taylor never had a chance ;-)    We were glad, in a sad way, that we had caught him and that he did not die of the problems outside. His death would have been very bad.    Your kitten may not have the same problem but you still need to get her to the vet.    The shape of her rib cage is not correct and she should be walking on her feet, not scooting around as you describe.    If a kitten does not eat, the kitten will not live.    Take her to the vet immediately. If you can't afford a vet, call the Humane Society or call around a find a vet we will at least look at the kitten for a reduced fee.    As to the mother of these kittens - have her spayed immediately after the kittens are weaned.    There are too many cats and kittens euthanized every day that you do not need to add to the population problem with new litters.    Yes, the experience of raising a litter of cats must be fantastic - I've never experienced it - but the overriding concern is to reduce the number of unwanted kittens.    Unless you plan to keep each and every kitten from each litter you cat has, or can find good homes for all of them, you should not let your cat have additional litters.    Even if you keep them or find homes for them - are you able to provide all the attention and love and medical care they need? And will the people who you give kittens to do the same?    We have trapped and taken in more than our share of feral cats over the years - 9 of them over the past 20 years.    Most feral cats are born to mothers who were dumped when they became pregnant.    Feral cats are wild animals. Unless they are caught before about an age of 3 months, there is little hope that they will tame down and become fully, or even partially, domesticated.    Please have your cat spayed.    If you have trouble affording it, check the Humane Society and see if they provide spaying at reduced fees or know of vets who do.    The Humane Society here will neuter a male for $10 and spay a female for, I think, $30    Compare those prices to the fees vets charge which can start at $150 and run as high as $300.    Again, get the kitten to the vet.    Once the kittens have stopped nursing, take the mother somewhere and have her spayed.    Please
0ef3O2m6aa	Yes, leave her be she is doing her job.  Be sure she is drinking tho otherwise her milk will dry up...esp with 1 pup.  She will be more apt to leave him when he is 3 days old.

The mom wants to keep her puppy/ies protected from everyone. She wants to make sure the puppy is safe. She will stay with her pup as long as she can. But if she wants to go to potty she has to go soon.. She will be less protective as the puppy gets older.
w4DIPHf1aa	depends on the plants..    use plants that feed of the water column (thats about 90% of them)and the substrate doesn't matter much.    fluorite is good but insanely hard to rinse out in the beginning. A single bag will take you about 4-6 hours to rinse. brutal stuff, not worth it.    Eco-complete is rip  and dump and a little better nutrient wise. As well it's black which is awesome for bringing out plant and fish colors.    fluorite makes black sand....may not need rinsing and sand in a tank is really nice.    regular black sand is fine as well, plants easily root in it and get nutrients from the water.    amazon swords are root feeder, just give them a root tab that's all.    the light you choose is key not the substrate, a 6500-6700k light is mandatory.        good luck!!!|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Roman gravel is recommended for plants, it's fine enough to encourage a good root system and unlike sand it allows the roots to breathe.

I always found that a dog that age will tire their owner out and it's best to give them constructive activity rather than let them chew the house apart, or even toys. That means hard core walks, trips to the dog park to socialize with other dogs and get their energy out, more walks, and many games of fetch. Keep the dog running.     And yes, you will get tired too - it's the age of a puppy that has tons of energy and doesn't have a fully grown a brain so they don't know what to do with it all.  You may also try agility classes or even obedience classes because when the brain is working overtime, the body usually tires too.|`|urMivi74aa	Most undesirable canine behaviors and their destructive habits usually develop because a dog is bored, lonely, or both.

zC4cgGhqaa	You didn't say how old your cat was...?  Older cats do go off their food, and sometimes there is nothing wrong.    However my 7 month old cat was off her food a few weeks back and it turned out she had a throat infection of some sort!  So if you are worried, if this has been going on for more then 3 or 4 days already, or if your cat is losing weight, I would have her checked out at the vet.  It's better to be safe than sorry, just in case there is something wrong.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	either fur ball, or she could have a bad tooth|`|DIEih5asaa	Probably a fur-ball or she is finding grub elsewhere.|`|2d4ba6b7cd6c6a7bc081ea3fa55f00c4aa	Hello!  This happened to two of my cats recently. I was worried but all turned out well;The first is an older cat and the vet said that she had sore gums and gave her some tablets and an injection and cleared it up. The second cat was trying to vomit and it was a fur ball, again injections and some paste in a tube to help the fur ball pass. It is so worrying when a cat won't eat. It might be just that she fancies some different food but consider the other options. I hope your cat gets better, tell us what happens as it is always useful to know!  Bye!
aJSUlD0Baa	It could be just sleepies or she may have a slight cold. I can hurt them a little if you try to rub them off dry. Try wetting a towel and have your spouse hold her still. She still won't like it better it will be a gentler way to remove them.|`|VPycXVIlaa	One of my cats gets those all the time. I just make him let me remove them. Use a warm wet cloth if she doesn't like you picking them off. They are just sleepies. I wouldn't worry about it unless the white of the cats eye starts getting red or the iris starts getting cloudy.|`|AA11352641	It's just eye boogers. My cat gets them.|`|HGzKBc4eaa	I don't know what could be causing it but you shouldn't worry too much.

The only exception would be breeds with incredibly high prey drives where SOME of the dogs in the breed will never tolerate cats.  Sighthounds and bully breeds fall under this category.  That doesn't mean you should avoid those breeds- just be sure the dog gets along with your cat before committing.    Your best bet would be to adopt a dog from a shelter- most shelters will do cat testing before adopting the dog out to see if the dog is compatible with cats.|`|TYjXGyCzaa	Lab or Golden.  Possibly a poodle.|`|MURxMnLtaa	I would also go with a lab or poodle....Something without a very high prey drive and easily trained.|`|RNqHUNgEaa	Almost every breed of dog can be trained to get along with cats. Even sighthounds that were bred for centuries to hunt small furry things can get along with cats, and a lot of people have owned both at the same time.    When you have the puppy introduce it safely to the cat. Put the puppy on a leash, and have someone carry the cat closer to the dog. Let the dog sniff the cat, but not snap. If the dog is nice, give him/her a treat. Keep doing this, showing the dog the cat, then giving the dog a treat. Dogs are smart and will learn that cats mean tasty treats from you, and will learn to behave.|`|6qsocyK3aa	If the cats have already established your house as their territory, the puppy will probably grow up to accept them. I don't think there is any specific breed that particularly like/dislikes cats. I wouldn't get a large dog purely because they do not know their own strength and may inadvertently hurt your cats.|`|px6du98zaa	I have always had cats and dogs in the same house including a standard poodle, 2 labs, huskies, and german shepherd.  However, my cats have always been tough as nails and actually enjoy playing with the dogs.  My theory is that if you get the dog as a pup and he grows up being around cats then it's fine.    You just need to introduce them calmly.    Good luck!|`|xPxm8ONiaa	Petfinder.com    You can adopt a dog, and it shows if the dog is good with cats. Good Luck :)
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Wow.  That is a *rare* case.    I, of course, will say please don't get rid of the ferret.  I know it's tough and kinda horrible situation right now.  But, it isn't the ferret's fault.  I live in NC, where did you get the ferret?  If she did not tell you the truth about his behavior, that is a sign of an irresponsible and *bad* breeder.    It is a trust issue.  He probably had some behavioral issues from the get go, and when he felt your fear/frustration/anxiety, he took it in and decided he couldn't trust you.  It will take time for you and him to regain that.  You will have to bond with him before you can truly discipline.  Wear gloves (I generally protest people wearing gloves, but in you case you NEED them).  Wear as much protective clothing as you want, so YOU feel comfortable being around him.  Go into the ferret area often, but for 15 minutes maximum at a time.  Sit and talk, not directly at him, but in general.  Let him be around you.  If he bites, say a firm (but not loud) no and give him a timeout (no more than 10 minutes or he won't associate the  punishment to his behavior).  I know you've tried this in the past, but you just have to keep it up for a while longer.  Make sure to play with Ferret A in front of the cage.    Once he can be around you without biting you EVERY TIME he can, try scruffing.  Every time he *looks* too interested in an area have you grabbed the skin above his shoulderblades, given him a very LIGHT shake, hiss, and then say no.  Make sure to PRAISE him when he decides not to do the behavior (I sounded like an idiot when I was training my biters.  I'd be saying 'ahht' one second then have to turn around and go 'good baby' the next ALL THE TIME.  And, believe me, I know what it's like, my youngest two drew blood, left wounds/bruises crippled my hands for a day at a time.  It hurt and it sucked but they did come around.  My female still has some issues but she is a cuddle-bug, too, now).    You have to stay calm throughout it all.  That's the only way to get it to work.  And he *will* learn.  I bet something happened to him that left him leery, and then not getting an experienced owner (not your fault, you weren't expecting this and weren't even *told*).  Just, don't give up.      Feel free to email me with any questions or if you just need something clarified.     Good luck :)|`|mwgB5NtUaa	lol ...yeah|`|gfwK3SWIaa	I don't know anything about ferrets, but I'll try to find out some options.  1) Look for a no-kill shelter.  2) Ferrets have a pecking order, so you need to display dominance.  3) Get in it's head. Dress up in a giant ferret suit and growl at it.|`|bepZupAfaa	i feel so sorry for you. the breeder you got the ferrets from saw you coming.  she had a chance to get rid of an out of control ferret that she didn't want to deal with herself. as a breeder goes she is not a good one and i wouldn't recommend her to anyone else that you know who is looking to get a ferret.    i have 5 ferrets and none of mine were or are biters like this one appears to be.    how long have you had the ferrets?  if it hasn't been that long try to keep doing as you have been. if it has been a while i would consider finding a ferret rescue shelter. at least he will have a chance to live.    it really seems like the bad ferret may have been miss treated by a male at the breeder's place.    if the ferret has not been neutered and has reached puberty that could be why he is so aggressive. male ferrets tend to do this if they haven't been fixed.      as i said the breeder was hiding the fact that this little guy was extremely aggressive.    hope this helps with your decision as i know it is going to be a big one on your part.    lots of luck wish i could help more    e-mail me if you have any further question maybe between the two of us we can figure out what his problem might be|`|d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	Have you talked to the breeder to return him? This is a horrible thing that she's did- she KNEW that he was nasty, so she knew that if you couldn't see him, then you would take him regardless. That is extremely irresponsible on her part. Maybe on this forum there is someone in your area willing to take the ferret for a challenge if you don't want to keep him.   http://www.ferretopia.proboards51.com  Everyone on there is extremely nice and there are tons on there that have conquered the worst biters you can imagine. I'm sure someone would love to take in your ferret. If not, please don't give him to a shelter or to another home on Craigslist unless they're very ferret-knowledgeable.     Have you tried the scruff method? Whenever he bites, scruff him, hiss, and flip him onto his back and drag his butt on the floor for a few feet. And, I know you've tried persistence, but it really is key. If you don't scruff him even one time, he'll think that he might be able to get away with it. Wear long sleeves and gloves if you aren't comfortable around him, and know that you're not hurting him when you're scruffing, and as long as he's scruffed it's almost impossible for him to hurt you. (It is possible, but it's difficult!) Good luck!|`|K8FhZf8maa	Honestly, I would get rid of the ferret. If you are unhappy with him and you can't train him then that might be better for the both of you. And when you are fending off the other ferret you can't play with "Ferret A". I would also call the breeder and complain. He needs to know that things like this are not acceptable. But I do know what you are going through. I once had a dog and she was a perfect angel for about a year. Then all of a sudden she ran away and got into fights with the neighbors animals. Then my other younger dog started following her when she would run away. I had five dogs and couldn't let them outside to go to the bathroom without two of them running away. After about a year of failed training I gave up. I sent her to the humane society. Now none of my dogs run away and I have a more pleasant life. I can leave my dogs in the yard on nice days and neighbors aren't complaining. (My neighbors threatened to shot her). It's just better for the other animals. So your benefiting yourself, Ferret B, and anyone else that Ferret A will come in contact with. And ferrets live awhile so are you ready to deal with this ferret for 5 more years?|`|KQCjZBRRaa	Are your ferrets spayed/neutered? Animals that aren't spayed/neutered tend to be more agressive and destrucive than pets that are.|`|XK9RLaPeaa	If the breeder was willing to pawn an aggressive animal off on someone, then that wasn't a good breeder. Which means that she didn't care for or treat these animals right. A ferret doesn't get that aggressive without some trauma that made him that way. It isn't helping that you are physically scolding him though. When you do that to a small animal like a ferret, they dont understand, and will get ever more aggressive. They dont see it as a consequence for their action, they see it as you attacking them. And he is now seeing it as, he has to protect himself from you because you make him MAD. He is danger to have if you aren't very experienced with ferrets. You probably wont be able to tame him. Please dont take him to a shelter though. Search online to find a ferret rescue in your area, there is usually many in a state. You will have to drive him there or maybe they will meet you half way, but it is best for him. They know exactly how to handle these cases and will tame him. And find him a good home. The shelter will euthanize an aggressive ferret 100% sure. Good Luck!
9AzUeF9saa	You can make your own nasty tasting stuff using vinegar, hot sauce, lemon juice, or whatever else they don't like and mix it all together and put it on what he likes to chew on.  Also get him some chew toys/bones and praise whenever you find him chewing on them, and play with them with him like fetch etc.  If you don't want to make the stuff then you can go to a store and buy 'Bitter Apple'  my dog hates it.  She runs away as soon as she sees the bottle.  If the chewing persists, then get a water gun and hide behind a wall when you find him chewing on something he isn't supposed to and shoot him with it.  Try to hit his nose because he won't like it.  it doesn't hurt him but he will find it annoying.    Good Luck!  :)|`|cETQuE9waa	Increase exercise and get the puppy into some obedience classes.|`|MURxMnLtaa	Nylabone chew toys....your pup shouldn't be left on its own if it is chewing, so if you can't watch him he needs to be in a big roomy kennel with some chew toys.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	if he is teething he/ she need to chew get the dog a rubber bone or a chew toy|`|wLbz7BePaa	i suggest you get a chewing toy for him maybe with a squeaker.it could be because your puppy is teething and starting to grow his teeth.|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	try getting a rubber toy for him to chew on;   if it doesn't work, just wait it out; he'll get over it.|`|nI8G21y8aa	get this spray that you can put on what ever he likes to chew on. it has a really bad taste and he'll learn.|`|XtvI9cVHaa	hes teething like babies do  wait a while  and get him toys till then|`|WkD9oAUiaa	I  did the lemon juice thing. all you do is squeeze some lemon juice onto the spot it chews on and then he will stop. they hate the bitter, sour taste of lemons. it works for me. good luck!|`|TYjXGyCzaa	I think take your puppy for longer walks so that he will get tired.

Just repeat this process and in no time your puppy will listen to the No ok
EJpiaCMQaa	Yes, it could be a tumor.  Some tumors are black in color.  I had a parakeet who had a tumor on his leg last year.  Unfortunately, his was an aggressive malignant tumor and he died a month later.  There is nothing you can do about its toe.  The canary needs to see a vet.  It needs to be treated ASAP.
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)     First thing I'd like to say to ever is that ALL hamsters bite, they've only been "pets" since the 1930s so they're still quite wild.  Try to be calm when you're around her.  Hamsters are very intuitive and pick up on our feelings.      I know you're really nervous because she's bitten you, but take a few deep breaths and think happy thoughts before you try to handle her :) I've helped a lot of pet owners with this issue over the years, and this is great for dwarf (any of the 4 breeds) or Syrian (aka Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda, etc)!    Remember to never wake your hamster up to play! They'll be calmer if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish (and dwarfs are little speed demons so it may try to run up your arm). Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience    Please feel free to message me if you need any additional advice - I'm glad to help :)|`|XrMMH5tZaa	some hamsters just cannot be trained  they are just born killers  lol  just try hard to let her know u love and wont hurt her|`|SlxeK1p6aa	take it slow in introducing her to you    let her get used to your scents then when she feels comfortable try to stroke her and just generally take it step by step and if she ever looks stressed either leave her alone for a bit or move back a few steps and repeat the process.    I hope this helps|`|XurYYreBaa	Hamsters are often territorial.  It was a month before I could handle ours @ all & he still tries to attack if I put my hand into his cage.  We've reached a compromise-- I'll open the bottom door of his habitat & he'll come out if he's in the mood.  When I want to clean his cage I'll usually clean the top stories while he's asleep on the bottom & then do the bottom when he's in his exercise ball.  Be patient, persistent & understanding with your hamster & although she may *always* be territorial the 2 of you can work out your own compromise.|`|7AI58IS8aa	Some hamsters may be a little agressive. Before you handle your hamster, make sure to wash your hands with soap and water.    i think you need to earn your hamster's trust, so that it won't bite you. You can wear those thick gardening gloves so that you won't be scared that it will bite you. Get used to handling it. If you trust it, then it will learn to trust you. Pet her when she is eating so that she gets used to your hand being in her cage and touching her.     If it's biting you because you wake it up during the day, then don't. They are really grumpy and will bite if you wake it up during the day and try to play with it.     Good Luck With your hamster!|`|3oanK9hkaa	Wear rubber gloves and long sleeves. You have to train her to stop biting, so here's an article that tell you how. It's way too much to write here:|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Pick her up using a tube - this can even be an empty paper towel tube - let her crawl into it from her cage and then out onto your hand.    Never try and bribe hamster out with treats in your hand - they don't see all that well and you could get bitten by mistake!    A bin cage lets you approach your pet from a less threatening position. Most store bought cages you have to reach at your hamster from above. Remember they are prey animals (food for pretty much everything else) and they are trying to keep from being your dinner! If you reach at them from above this is really similar to a bird or other animal attacking from above.    Be careful with too much lettuce, its high water content may cause diarreah in some hamsters.|`|PWvYB8mTaa	Your hamster was probobly like that maybe because someone abused her or didnt handle here enough were you got her from, or maybe shes just like that. Hamsters have such small brains so she doesnt think about what she does alot and they have no sense of anything. Hamsters can be like people, just brought up the be mean.     You should onley have left here alone for about a day and THEN start handling her right away ALOT so she could get used to you. Try to sing to here or talk in a nice calming, soft voice so she can get used to you and your voice so she doesnt get startled by you if shes heard you. ALWAYS de-sensitize her so she isnt startled.    Hope this Helped!!    ~Gina~|`|FcLc5zspaa	duuuude, I don't know.

These are African cichlids. And quite a few (but not all) African cichlids are herbivores and feed mainly on algae growing on rocks.

NnYB9eXiaa	Please read the following before you consider doing ANYTHING. And never never ever ever ever breed hamsters from a pet store - the reasons for this are listed below.    Go to the library, get some books out on hamsters.  Talk to a local breeder, see if they'll mentor you.      The following list may look like all negative things, and the first section IS a list of reasons not to breed unless you are completely prepared, the second section contains information you need to know if you still decide to breed.    Please keep all the following things in mind BEFORE you breed:    Don't breed if your hamsters are from a pet store.    Why?    Poor breeding causes things like shortened lifespans, susceptibility to illness, and poor temperement (i.e. aggressive hamsters).    Well bred hamsters are not aggressive; this does not mean they won't ever bite, but it does mean they won't go out of their way to bite and will be generally more receptive to handling and be quite a bit friendlier.    Second, if they are from a pet store you don't know their genetic background.    You may be passing along undesirable traits such as aggressiveness and tendencies towards cancers, illness, and physical deformities.    Third, hamsters can have 14+ babies per litter.    Selling them to a pet store guarantees their death; they will be sold as feeders for reptiles and snakes.    Unless you can line up 14+ homes ahead of time, DO NOT BREED.    Fourth: Hamsters are already seriously overpopulated in pet stores; many go for feeders, many more die before they leave the store.    Unless you have an exceptionally rare mutation, and know its (and its prospective mate's) genetic background and pedigree, you should not breed them.    There is no good reason to breed already poorly, and over bred hamsters.    Please do not breed your hamsters for their sake and the sake of any offspring.    If you want more hamsters, adopt one from a shelter, buy one from a breeder, or as a dead last resort, buy one from a pet store. [Edit from Daisy - try petfinder, freecycle and craigslist as well]    Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal, not just because they were able to buy a male and female.    http://www.pet-care-experts.com/archive....    ----------------------------------    Important information before making a big decision:    1. You'll need quite a few cages, bins are preferable as breeding cages but there is money involved in setting up a hamstery.    2. You generally need a room just for the hamstery, you aren't going to want a lot of disturbance with the pups or pregnant mothers - especially if you have other animals or small children in the house.    3. You'll be spending a lot of time with your hamsters, you need to make sure that you have time with school and other activities to balance this out.    4. You need to be prepared for visits to the vet.  These aren't always inexpensive visits.    5. You'll need lots of research on genetics and health history.  Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal.  You should never breed a hamster bought from a pet store, so you'll need to find a local breeder - perhaps they'll mentor you - again, this will take a lot of your free time.    6.  You need to make sure you have homes lined up *before* you begin breeding.  It's safe to assume a minimum of 2-4 pups and it can be upwards of 14 in a litter.      7.  You really shouldn't try to sell the pups until you've bred multiple times and built up a reputation.  This means you won't be earning money from the pups, so there will be money involved that you won't be able to recoup for awhile.    As far as the actual breeding, and logistics and all of the technical aspects of things, there are many good breeders on this site that can help you.  I'm sure one of them will chime in on that portion of things :)    Just remember, study, research, think, then breed! Try to possibly find an breeder online that will mentor you. Home breeding, when done responsibly is perfectly fine - just be sure you're ready and you start with 2 healthy animals whom you know the genetics and health history of :)|`|6Rt9aM8daa	Well Syrians can never be kept together. No matter what. And, there is no need for breeding. The mom actually ate the babies because of Human scent. Get a Syrian, do not cross breed.    As for the baby eating, I hope you know about weaning, raising, separating, not touching, mating and birth.|`|RjyNInW6aa	try dwarf hamsters. They usually are friendlier.|`|7AI58IS8aa	Don't listen to the first answerer. Dwarf hamsters are not friendlier. Theybite more. Get a teddy bear hamster. THey are cute and cuddly. Otherwise, just get the cutest one at the petstore.|`|C4V11yJLaa	It's sound as is you have had some previous hammies....  Why don't you go for a differnt breed? but make sure you do all your home work what ever breed you pick! :D
mXG5H0mMaa	I found my Dobermann to be a rather good apartment dog if you're considering a large dog.  Despite his large size.  At 115 lbs and shoulders at my waist, he's rather large.  But, they are built for speed and not stamina, so a quick walk twice a day, generally less than 10 minutes, is plenty of exercise, keeps him in good shape, and expels enough energy to keep him relaxed most of the day.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Chihuahuas, Poms, Pugs, Yorkies are popular city dogs.    Poms are apparently a pain to housebreak. They need daily brushing and a weekly trip to the groomer.    Yorkies, despite public knowledge, need a good daily walk. Same grooming requirements as Poms.    Chihuahuas don't require much grooming if short-haired. If long-haired, same as Yorkies and Poms. They don't need long walks or anything.    Pugs are kind of couch potatoes.    If you're planning on spaying or neutering your new puppy, why not try adopting? There are plenty of small dogs out there. Shelter dogs are generally up to date with shots and have already been spayed/neutered (but some shelters jump the gun and fix before since months which is too young, so be careful).|`|TPhIWWniaa	I personally have two Chihuahuas, I think small breeds would work in an apartment as they would be able to run around, get their exercise (you don't have to walk them outside in the cold) and they can be trained to go on pads or newspapers. If you get a large breed the poor thing couldn't be able to run around freely in the apartment because they wouldn't have enough room and they would ruin carpeting or hard wood floors.|`|16XpYCBmaa	I would have to say a small dog because they just work better in apartments. Maybe a chihauhua, pomeranian, cocker spanial, poodle, or a yorki. Them are all some cute small dogs.|`|6c72e810c38f0fa856b4ce67b591ff0eaa	any dog would do ok in an apt if they are exercised properly...if you have a fenced in yard you can ask the landlord if its ok to let your dog run around or if not you can take your dog on long walks...if you dont have time to exercise the dog then a lap dog would probably be best like a chihuahua or min pin because they are small enough to get enough exercise just by running around the house,,,also a smaller dog would be better because if you move not a lot of landlords like bigger dogs so you might be forced to give your dog up...in my opinion you shoulg go to a shelter and look around...there are many small dogs waiting for homes

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Here goes... and this goes for any crocodilian:    No, they're not good pets.    They've got millions of years of instinct going for them, they will never accept or return attention from you. They have a mouthful of teeth that they enjoy using, are very difficult to rehome when they become unhandlable, and are nearly impossible to find medical care for.    This isn't even touching on difficulties with housing. Oh yeah, a hatchling can live in a large aquarium for a while, but then it's going to need a large pond to move into... if you don't live somewhere that's warm enough year round, this means, as someone else mentioned, you'll get to remodel either one of your rooms or your garage. If you do happen to live somewhere that it can live outside, you'll have to build something caiman-proof, which can get into some pretty decent effort construction-wise, burying the fencing deep enough that it can't dig out, having it high enough not only so the caiman can't climb out (Yes, crocodilians CAN climb) but also high enough to discourage neighborhood kids from climbing in... filtration system in the pond (You don't want him living in his own crap, do you? Heck, this is a problem even when they're little... people think turtle tanks are hard to keep clean, they've never fought with crocodilian poop...    The list of reasons why these animals don't make good pets goes on and on and on and on.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	They sure are cute when young, but they grow quickly.  In the wild they get to be 18 feet long.  They live in tropical areas.  I would not recommend one unless you have a nice warm pond that's pretty big.|`|PSiNv7gUaa	They are not good pets for anyone, experienced or not.  They are very aggressive, and even the dwarf caiman can reach 6-8 feet in length.  You need to have a very large enclosure for them (if you live in an area with cold winters, you would basically be building a garage-sized house for it, complete with plumbing and electricity), and your electric and water bills would be outrageous.  Also, you may have a hard time finding a vet in your area willing to deal with caimans, as even exotic vets have their limits.  Many states outlaw these types of exotics without permits, so if you do get one, check with your local conservation department, although again, I would advise against getting one for a pet.|`|CUFnorZyaa	Define good. Certainly not a pet for a beginner. Take a LOT of space for one. Not to mention their bite is far worse than their bark.|`|u61yKsE3aa	They do not make good pets unless you are an extremely experienced reptile keeper.   They get decent sized, require lots of care and cost, and can be very aggressive, not to mention they are illegal many places.  If however they are legal where you live and you are very experienced then they can make a challenging and enjoyable addition to your collection .  I have not personally owned a caimen but I have owned alligators and have a salty. Hope that helps.

Y8ssQvCKaa	You could be a responsible owner and get it neutered so he doesn't go insane searching for a mate and risk an early death due to genital cancer.    BUT HEY. =)    That's just me be a responsible, caring human being with a neutered male cat of my own who is purring happily into his ninth year without worrying about finding a mate or suffering from life-shortening cancer.|`|PImvmP1paa	There really is no mating season for cats and dogs.     Cats spray. Weather it's to mark their territory or to lure mates, that's their business. But male cats will spray and it smells really really bad. If you want your house to smell like cat pee on an extremely hot day, then don't get him neutered.     If you get your cat neutered it won't harm his ability to "mate" he just won't get female cats pregnant. But after you get any gender of cat fixed they will get lazy.|`|9dlRcS7caa	None whatsoever, you have to live with the smell that comes with territory markings of your cat.

672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	No, it is not cruel.    there are thousands and thousands of cats dying at shelters every day because people refuse to get their cats fixed, and let them reproduce more and more unwanted cats that need to be euthanised. there are more cats at shelters than there are people to adopt them.    Also, cats who are not used for breeding purposes are suseptable to reproductive related cancers. There have been hundreds of studies on this and 98% of them concur on this matter. Fixing a pet that doesn't reproduce protects them from reproductive cancers.    It's not a painful proceedure for a cat your cat's age, and recovery is fairly quick. generally around 14 days.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	it's not cruel cats that are fixed live happy normal lives and live longer to my cat shadow lived for 22 years before we had to put him to sleep|`|GrwWH5XJaa	You're so evil...

Of course its mean  Let the cat do the dirty.|`|jPxkg7vKaa	NO! Do not even think this.     This helps to control the overpopulation of cats in our country. It is important to do this - not doing it is more cruel. It does not hurt them.|`|Run7dyraaa	Absolutely not. Cats who are neutered are healthier, happier, and you are helping the world by not over populating it with unwanted kittens. The only thing cruel you can do to a cat is to declaw it.|`|JwDWwgIcaa	i don't find anything wrong. They do not hurt it, the cat feels no pain. I have a spayed female cat and she is normal like any other cat. I know 2 cats that have been neutered, they are the same as any cat. They neuter/spray at a young age because then they would never of known what they could do if they were not neutered/sprayed.     :D|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	i would say it would be cruel to neuter a female cat after it had had one litter of kittens. how would you feel if you could only have have one child, no matter whether you wanted more.    other than that i would say its not cruel, as long as you dont change your mind :S|`|AA11352641	When your male cat impregnates a female and the kittens wind up euthanized in a shelter, that's cruel.

It is fine. The cat doesn't get hurt and even though it is not natural it really does help the animal population.

Personally I'd spay/ neuter them since I'd feel bad for them to long for something they cannot have. Also, if they are siblings they might reproduce in your home and I am not sure how good "incest" is for cats (weak litter).   Since there are so many unwanted animals out there and thousands are killed every month at shelters I'd opt for neutering....|`|v1uNUcwCaa	no. mine got done when he was 6 months. i took him 2 the vets at 10am he was out just after 4pm same day. he hasnt missed it at all.    my friend didnt get her cat done till a woman knocked on the door and presented her with 7 kittens. my friends cat is the only ginger cat in the area so it was obvious that he was the dad since most of the kittens were ginger. thats when she got him done.    the only issue i cant think of it neutered cats can be more prone to put on weight. but if he is outside then he probably wont.|`|79b3d0f8c17037a2e4a5a3f573d4598faa	NO its anything but cruel,its responsible.cats dont know any better.theres already enough unwanted cats dogs etc in rescues...|`|cN6AMupIaa	Un Neutered tom cats will mark their territory by spraying pee on any surface or floor including inside the house and fight With any other tom cat in the area for rights to mate with she cats. this will cause all sorts of injuries that will need vets attention and cost you more money ,they get abscesses from other cat bites that if left untreated can result in disfigurement and blood disorders.  Female cats that are not spayed will attract all the Tomcats in the area and you will have howling Toms outside or trying to get in the house to mate. they especially like to howl in the middle of the night.  The choice is yours!|`|pF63IMyVaa	its as natural as having a cat live in your house. it prevents cancers,unwanted litters,accidents from fighting with other males, and spraying. idk if you want you house smelling like cat piss. they probably already started spraying. you should get them fixed asap. once they start spraying they'll never stop. neutering them will decrease the frequency of their spraying.|`|pXYqAreqaa	no  we  have two cats we look after  them. a lot of cats are left out all night in all  weathers. if you have a lot of unwanted cats they get left   to run wild|`|rMP9BCyGaa	I would suggest that it is more cruel not to neuter.    You will be much happier knowing your boys won't be spraying in your house, and neutering them could stop them fighting, straying/roaming looking for females, plus un-neutered males tend to hunt more too.    Have a chat with your vet about the pros and cons I'm sure they would be most happy to advise you.|`|c0ecfd9c0dc2333cceb9f6f88da9f142aa	They sedate the animal and do what they have to do.  It is more cruel to leave your animal fertile and add to the growing numbers of unwanted cats in the world.|`|I4uIOp1maa	no i dont think so. It wont hurt them and it would make them less hyperactive. i wanted my bunny neutured but i left it too late. i wouldnt say it was cruel at all. dont worry about it|`|NvbTnLrBaa	people get fixed all the time, and there perfectly fine. and i'm not sure but i think its more healthy. but i don't know for sure. the cruel thing is when you walk in to the pound and see all the kittens that will be put to sleep cuz someone didn't fix there cat.|`|aZBypUl0aa	nah it isnt cruel|`|363YPQ62aa	No it's cruel not too|`|aRen4EBPaa	Do it. They won't be so aggressive after it's done. It's better for your cat, you and the world.   AND you won't have messes to clean up. If you know what i mean!|`|hY3JlKKaaa	Well, if its for good intentions. but i will mention this: It does in fact change their mood. They will DEFINETLY become more docile and less playful female or male, just take that into consideration. Ive had about 10 cats in my life span, and all were neutered.|`|0UxjzoUxaa	well if you don't want to neuter then you can always jsut spend the time cleaning his pee of the walls, cause he'll probably spray all over your place. good luck! its not natural but eatting cat food isn't natural..peeing in a box isn't natural.....and its cruel to let him have his balls and crave what he can't have..because you're still blocking a "natural" thing a male cat is born to do.....|`|yY5LdTVvaa	Well just think. If you were the cat, would you want your owner to neuter you? But yes, it will help you with taking care of the cat if you neuter it.|`|ZlcYSRviaa	as long as you don't mind tomcat spray, or having to deal with a litter of cats every year let them have their genitals. I think spray stinks, and kittens, while cute, aren't worth it year after year.|`|JvY5KL22aa	no, i don't think it's cruel. i think it's actually helpful! i mean, i know a lot of ppl might see it that way. but you can't afford to take on the lives of other kitties! lol|`|M83LclV4aa	yes|`|5vFGO57Kaa	No its responsible.  There are too many unwanted cats and dogs about.|`|Wwkk87Igaa	No, it's not cruel. It means that  ---they will not get in fights.  ---they won't pee all over your house. (Well they might do that anyway but that's just your weird cat.)  ---Your neighbour's cats don't get pregnant.  ---They won't hump random stuff.  ---If you're not prepared for kittens, it would be far, far crueler to have to abandon or give them away on short notice.|`|bQz2bM42aa	No it isn't|`|aJSUlD0Baa	It would depend on your feelings about it. I for one do feel that it is cruel to neuter any animal. When people tell me I should neuter I just tell them how would they feel if I wanted them neutered. That's just my opinion though. I felt I had to neuter one of my dogs because she had her hips broken when she was hit by a car and for her to get pregnant could cost her her life. I don't care what the vet says it can and does change their attitude. She has become a nervous wreck and a trouble maker since and to this day I regret getting her fixed. Now with cats they have a tendency to become very lazy and over wight which can cause problems with their health later, but like I said it's your choice.|`|kIIf9Z6Eaa	You won't feel so bad in a few more months when he starts spraying nasty-smelling urine all over the place.  Just do it now.|`|JOwiKhRBaa	no becuase if you dont want more cats since they will probally end up at the pound.|`|BRiRoV1raa	Absolutely not.  The vets take proper precautions, such as injecting the anesthetic which puts them to sleep and making sure everything is sterile. The cat, although he or she may be a little sore for a couple days after the operation, will feel no pain while going through this procedure.    PLUS, as most others have already mentioned, it prevents further over-population of cats. And that's definitely a good thing.     hope this helped. =)|`|TNqo0zVfaa	No to be honest it better to have them done because it stops them from having kittens and also running away i have a cat and shes just be done, i have another one and he was done ages ago. But my other cat ran off a few weeks ago and that one hasn't been neutered, so its best to have them done. From my experience.     Hope it helps x|`|OtvId52Taa	Yes, this is little cruel to do this. They were meant to roam and mate and things like this, but it would be better for them.    Yes, I would get him neutered, because if he is an outside cat, and live in a place where cars are close by, then it lessens his chance of being hit by a car, I had an outside cat, he wasn't neutered, and his tail got crushed by a car tire and he wasn't able to use the bathroom anymore, and we had to put him down. So it lessens the chance of being hit. Also, if he roams the streets and gets a cat pregnant, then the kittens could get hit by a car also, but if he will be an inside cat, then I wouldn't neuter him unless you let him outside by himself to use the bathroom. I hope this helps.|`|Z90fVG1saa	It's not cruel. it's the responsible thing to do|`|xUYNEGLOaa	It isn't 'natural'....but nor are vaccinations, worming treatments, premium foods, life saving operations...you know, all the other things we do for our cats, since welcoming them into our domestic lives.    An entire male will spend he majority of his adult life living with an unbelievable amount of frustrated sexual energy, as his 'natural' drive is to procreate, procreate, procreate.  Same for the females.  By neutering, you will lessen, or eradicate, that desperate 'want', and your cats will be able to live a more sedate lifestyle.    But, my dear, the choice is yours. =^.^=|`|Dnx0pYjBaa	get them neutered.  It decreases their risk of some diseases, lowers unwanted kitten numbers, and helps them not be as dominant over each other and other cates in the future|`|vHwYENVjaa	UNLESS you plan on having a female cat by any means, whether GETTING one or taking in a STRAY, or if you will be letting your male cats OUTSIDE, or if they have a chance at all to GET outside without you letting them.... then there is no REASON to do this.    I also do not find this humane. And the person who said that they do not even know the difference... did they find a way to talk to a cat? Because there is no way that cat wasn't very distraught after that procedure. And I HIGHLY doubt if the cat could make a choice.. that it would choose to be on the operating table..    My cat is neutered because that is what his previous owners did to him. He is 9 years old. He is an old cat and I adopted him because of his age and the fact that he needs a stable home. His previous owners also had him DECLAWED, both FRONT and BACK... How sick!    I also have a dog, she is 3 years old, I've had her since she was 3 MONTHS old, and she is not fixed. I will not do it. I look at her, and i JUST can't FATHOM doing something like that to her. I don't take her around other dogs in heat, I don't let her out on her own (she's a chihuahua) so I have NO REASON to do this except for some SICK pleasure of mine or so I don't have to deal with her being in heat.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	I've overseen many cat neuters. It is quick and painless.  What's far crueler is letting your tomcat create more kittens to be euthanized and negatively impact wildlife.      Of course, you could do what many people do:  let the tomcat stay indoors and be sexually frustrated day in and day out.      It's much, much more humane to have your cat neutered. As a plus, your neutered cat won't stink up your home and yard with foul-smelling urine.    I have to say I will never understand why anyone would have an intact pet, yet refuse to breed or spay it.  They think its more cruel to neuter the dog or cat, yet think completely overlook the fact that the dog or cat never gets to use those organs.  Either breed responsibly or better yet, spay or neuter.      Identifying with a pet's sexuality says more about the owner than it does the pet.  And frankly, its creepy.|`|BY0cV4kRaa	No, It's cruel not too.
6KxBqnstaa	Neither. The hawk would fly off as it sees the cat as a predator even though it is big. Also it sees the cat as a threat to its food source.

GOOD LUCK,|`|T8OFsBUUaa	You need to consult a professional - fear in dogs is pretty serious. I'd definatly avoid the pinch collar, though. If she sees something that scares her, and for whatever reason something jabs her in the neck she figures she probably has reason to be scared. I'd stay away from all types of positive punishment in this case (Pinch collars, choke chains, stuff like that.) Keep her in the yard for now and get her chasing a ball or something until you can get someone to help you with her.    The number 1 reason dogs bite is fear, so get this looked into ASAP!|`|mfXDUkRYaa	First of all, scrap the pinch collar. This will not benefit a fearful dog (or any dog for that matter, as they are nasty things). Try a harness - combined with halti if need be. But you need to do things gradually. If she is very scared then it will take a long time to show her she doesn't need to be afraid, but with patience and encouragement she will get there in the end and it will be worth it. Just remember she doesn't understand or know that things can't hurt her. You may need the help of a trainer/behaviourist - just make sure it's one that uses positive reinforcement only or they will only set her back.

My Lab Molly showed the first signs of illness in December 2003, but it was that far advanced that there was nothing that the vet could do for her, by the 1st of Feb 2004 she was suffering too much and had no quality of life, she had spent 5 days at the vets and was just getting gradually worse, so l had to make the decision to let her go, she had suffered enough and it was the last think l could do to help her.   She was only 6 years old, and only lived for a few weeks after being diagnosed, if the cancer had been diagnosed earlier then maybe with treatment she would have had longer, but she didn't show any signs of illness until it was too late.

My Dobermann Boris was four years old at the time of diagnosis {aggressive skin cancer}, the proposed treatment was major surgery & four sessions of carboplatin {chemotherapy} wouldn't be gruelling, the average survival time was 6 ~ 12 months of good health, so I opted for treatment.....with treatment he lived an additional 3.5 years {& he lived life to the full).     At what point did I make the decision to have him put to sleep?  When he developed multiple new tumours {not related to the original cancer} near many of his major organs, was rapidly losing weight & had been diagnosed with DCM, I knew that there was no quality time left for him. At that point he was put to sleep.     I appreciated every extra day that the treatment afforded & would not hesitate to opt for treatment again, *if* it was in my dog's best interest.    I now have every lump removed sent for analysis & question/research/get a second opinion if I am not satisfied/have doubts.    However difficult, you made the right decision for your dog.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Well, my dog (maltese) passed away from it. We noticed a bunch of sores on her belly and brought her in (after my mom determined they wouldn't just "go away" with regular washing *rolls eyes*)     The vet ran a few tests (blood, x-ray, ultrasound) and found a tumor on her spleen. They operated and removed it, but she passed away about six-seven days after the operation. When they got the biopsy back it turned out to be an aggressive cancer that would have killed her within the next several months anyway.    My dog was eleven.
u12ZCegEaa	This use to be my problem too a while ago, but here is my advice... when your dog bites you or jumps towards you... say "OW" really really LOUD.... make sure he freaks out hopefully back away because he will realize that he hurt you.. because this is a huge distraction from what he was doing.. or was about to do...    also, try putting pieces of beef, chicken, turkey, and such goodies in his toys.. like a kong for example is the perfect toy..  u can fill it up with peanut butter... treats.. whatever... or u can go to the petstore and buy cow ear or pig ear.. those are REALLY cheap per piece and are TOTALLY WORTH IT!    If that doesn't work, then gasp really loud when he lunges at you or bites you. Because dogs are shocked by your reaction to his actions... for example, if he bites you and your friend pets him saying bad boy, yet petting him.. the dog will get confused... but he will think that its ok to bite and just walk away.. which seems to be the problem now lol    but other than that... all i can say is that everytime he backs off from biting you.. give him treats... always have a few treats in your pocket... and make sure your dog realizes that you have treats! Just so that he knows that he will be rewarded if he behaves.    and if all of this doesn't work, then i suggest you take him to a dog training class.. they are usually like 80-150 bucks for 7 or 8 sessions depending on where you live and where you go.    i wish you gooood luck with your lab!  let us know how everything turns out.    just make sure that you practice a lot with the dog, because eventually he will need to learn how to behave and will give up biting.    good luck again     =]|`|VPycXVIlaa	Try giving him a lot of exercise. Take him on really long walks or on a jog. If he has spent all his energy walking/running then he won't be as agressive. Good luck!|`|NyNaJmIkaa	You get afraid of the dog. That's the problem.

urMivi74aa	I believe it's biopsy that can determine if it's cancer. the biopsy test will confirm if your dog's cancer is benign or malignant. Cancer isn't necessarily a death sentence for your dog. But when a lengthy and expensive treatment with no guarantee of a successful outcome is prescribed, it's no shame to think about yourself as well as your dog.    check out this link and learn a lot of things about canine cancer and what to do next.  http://elfurl.com/adw3i|`|PImvmP1paa	My dogs had to get put to sleep at the age of 15, but that's because they ended up getting that hip dysplasia that dogs get.

Two years later our other dog had the same thing but he was able to hold his bowels and my mom think he had a stroke, so we put him to sleep.

LPEO6AsCaa	None of my Golden's ever liked to sleep on a dog bed or anything else fluffy or soft.  Their place is on the floor.

It does affect their joints & elbows like callouses etc.  During the summer they might not use them but should access to some kind of bedding.

KEYgd73saa	It is almost certainly hiding from the Convicts.  Convicts are NOT notorious for interbreeding with any other fish, let alone Blood Parrots (which are hybrids themselves, and usually sterile).  You've got nothing to worry about as far as interbreeding, but you will need to keep an eye on the aggression, because you could very easily come home to a tank of just 2 Convicts one day, or if the Convicts breed, 2 Convicts and 30 Convict fry.  If you have the means to do so, I'd really suggest you separate the two species.  Should you choose to keep the Convicts, try surface dwelling fish like Danios, Hatchets, and Killifish.  Should you choose to keep the Blood Parrots, a school of large Tetras (Black Skirt, Diamond, Red Eye, etc.) and a shoal of 3-4 small Loaches (Dwarf Chain, Zebra, Yoyo, Burma, etc.) would do nicely.  Also, please realize that the Parrots will get too large for a 30 gallon tank, reallistically needing one upwards of 4 feet long as adults; it may be best to rehome them.

PhAMcZZuaa	I would not reccomend shipping boots for a horse this young, simply because the newness and strangeness of the boots may create more problems then they prevent.     If you can, open up your trailer as much as possible, remove divider if it has one, so you have a basic box stall. Bedding is key too, straw is good or shavings. A DOUBLE hay net is safer then a single for a young foal, much harder to get hung up in. No halter, or a breakaway one if you must. A dose of probiotics and Rescue remedy before and after also will help smooth the transition.    Best of luck with your new foal!|`|hEXb1unraa	5 months is still really young....it is also a long trip.......you can do 2 things First just leave him alone and don't put anything on his legs, it can be risky to do as if they get caught, scared or he gets hung up in them, what i would do is use a stock type trailer that was enclosed for warmth and bed that trailer like mad...at least knee deep with good pine shavings and let him ride loose....drive very slow and methodical making sure you stop every 4 to 6 hours for a couple hours to rest....babies have short attention spans and tire very easily......hauling bigger horses is way different and much easier.  The next suggestion and this is what i would do is either wait till he is a few more months older or have him professionally shipped...it is way worth the money and a shipping co like nation-wide will put him in a box stall and ship him properly and safely....they are very well recommended and have top notch people who work for them...i have used this service many times and have always received horses that were healthy and well rested. the other thing you have to worry about is shipping fever and stress induced colic or the possibility of strangles because of hauling a baby.....not something I would be wanting to do.|`|HY2i80mjaa	a horse that young will not understand shipping boots and may become frightened in a truck with them on.....just leave him be....i hope he's still with his mother, because that is very young to be separated...|`|ndqjst7taa	Yes you should buy shipping boots or even bandages, young horses can easly hurt themselves better safe then sorry|`|DmUG33axaa	shipping boots, or wraps. also rubber mats in trailer if you have it, and put shavings in the trailer, since she is so young she might be more apt to wig in the trailer, but thats not that far if you are going to canada.

Never for simply owning one.|`|tKBWZ7mCaa	I own a mutt, and have no problem with them at all.  I think that people generally connect the existence of mutts with one of two things:    -owners who did not get their dogs spayed/neutered and therefore allowed accidental breedings to create mutts    -people who intentionally mix breeds together and give them fancy names to disguise the fact that they are mutts    Because many people are against these two practices, they seem to be saying that they are against mutts.  But very few people are actually against the dogs themselves.  Once the dog is born, rescues and shelters do their best to give them a good life, and the wonderful people who adopt from these groups help with that.    There will always be mutts, and maybe that's not a horrible thing.  If not for mutts, many poorer people could never afford the $500+ that many breeder ask for their pure bred dogs.  And with all the low cost spay/neuter clinics and low cost vaccination clinics, one doesn't have to be rich to own a dog and take good care of it.      I value pure breds because you generally know what you are getting, and if you need a dog for a specific purpose (ranch work, police/protection work, guide dog, etc.) then pure bred dogs are invaluable.  But I also love mutts because they are unique, quirky, and often combine great traits of different breeds that I like.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	I have not seen anyone on here that is against mutts.

We have enough of them.  So get them neutered.    The intolerance occurs when somebody glibly writes a question, cooing about their labradoodle, or yorkasand, or poodog.  They're mutts, not breeds.  BYBs are adding to the mutt world, making huge profits, shystering customers, and screwing up breed standards.|`|C7X6PLTWaa	I've wondered that myself, since many many years ago when AKC started hosting Agility trials the club I was in was helping an area group get sanctioned and I had my Dalmation/Pointer mix there, and one of the obedience people walked up to me and said, "Why wouldn't you get a real dog?" To which I responded, "I have a real dog, what about you?" I have nothing against purebred dogs, but I don't take kindly to people getting an attitude against me and my dogs. (all rescues except one) Thankfully the majority of people I've met, don't care if my dog is purebred or half donkey .|`|x0Z19HJGaa	I have always had mutts. My Australian Shepard and Blue Healer mix is the best dog I have ever had! I think people just don't like "mixed" dogs because they are not "pure". It's a load of bologna! My sister in law claims mixed dogs are not bred to be good dogs. She doesn't get that it's all how you treat your dog not how they are bred. That's so ignorant! My boy is smart, kind and beautiful! He was treated right and taught to be a good boy. Not bred to be a good boy, that's so silly.|`|GroGnXTOaa	For one there are like everyone says "alot of dogs in the shelter that needs to be rescued". mutts are like a symbol of irresponsible breeding or so they say. Mutts also not of a good quality for selling or breeding so are not worth much. Cross breeding can cause defects on a mutt.    yeah i dont like stuck up snobs who think because they own a AKC dog or w/e and think they all that. Dogs are Dogs they do not to be ranked.... like all men are created equal.. all dogs are suppose to be created equal although some people dont see it that way.|`|9lXivaJMaa	Because their stuck up shits who support beating animals so people can have pure breeds.|`|AA12128656	oh heck i don't know anyone who has a problem with mutts.  mutts are great!   they are cute!  they are huggy!  they are fun to play with!    but there's more than enough to go around... so we needn't make more.    people here don't have a problem with folks who OWN mutts, that's a good thing... your local shelter is a great place to get one.     people here put down people who PAY MONEY for mutts bred on purpose by BYB's as designer dogs, etc.
meMF69tXaa	This is a way for rabbits to shed out the old fur and get new fur. It's just a biological thing and rabbits have been doing this since the begining of time.    It is important to feed your rabbit unlimited amounts of Timothy hay during this process. Not only does hay provide fiber, it aids in digestion of the fur balls and helps aid your rabbit in ridding these fur balls through the digestive system. It's a good idea to brush your rabbit during this time.    Rabbits normally moult every three months and some moults are heavier than others. Since it's spring, many rabbits will be moulting during this time.    One thing to watch for is lack of stools in your rabbit or change in behavior. Rabbits can ingest fur and if the fur does not pass, it can cause a blockage in your rabbit's digestive system. Keep a good eye on them during this time.|`|DLmwecMkaa	Rabbits moult so that they have a thinner fur coverage, that way they can stay as cool as possible in warm weather.    Female rabbits will moult and pull their own fur out when they are building a nest for their litter.|`|KWuYlxXgaa	Moult as in shedding fur? That's fairly normal around spring time. They're casting off their winter coat for their summer one. My rabbit went through that a month ago.
v0RsFaAzaa	I'm sorry about your cat! There is no way to predict what will happen in the future as far as movement goes. I think that if the cat does not regain movement, that she would not have any quality of life and it would be unfair to make her live the rest of her life paralyzed. I think in that case, as hard as it is, the only humane thing to do, would be to Euthanize her!|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Stay with what the Veterinarian says, that is why we pay for their services. Getting just any ones idea on what will happen is not good advise.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	yeah, id just go with what the vet says.  you would have to attend to her loads so if he says shes clear, make sure your ready to do that.  goodluck to her ?
TIlxoclXaa	It will help if you have your boyfriend feed the dog. Then the dog will begin to associate good things with your boyfriend, and it's safer to put down a dog dish than to try and treat a dog who might snap at you. Also, don't give your dog any treats unless your boyfriend is around. When your boyfriend enters the room, start giving the dog treats to distract him from getting snappy at your boyfriend. This also trains him that good things only happen when your boyfriend is around, and he should start to like him more. You can also try leaving the room whenever the dog starts to bark or growl at your boyfriend. The dog wants all your attention and he thinks your boyfriend is steeling it. If you completely withdraw your attention and leave the dog alone when he starts being aggressive towards your boyfriend, he will eventually realize that being mean isn't going to get him the attention he is trying to guard. Good luck!|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	Dogs see the world differently from the way we do. We communicate using our ears first, then our eyes, and lastly our nose. Dogs begin with the nose, then the eyes, and lastly the ears. Allowing a dog to experience our scent before we engage it in eye contact or speak to it is one way to establish trust.    When your boyfriend comes in the house, have him give no eye contact and not to acknowledge him.  Your dog needs to come to your boyfriend on his terms.      Also, have your boyfriend take him for a walk.  That will help for your dog to get to know him.     At feeding time, have your boyfriend have the honor of doing the job!  But, only feed your dog when he is in a calm state.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Could be he was abused by a male before you got him. I had a dog who hated tall men in uniforms. Get Cesar Milan's books and maybe he can give you some ideas to help.|`|0fuF2sHbaa	If he doesn't do it to other men (fear aggression, some dogs are scared of men), he's probably jealous of your boyfriend.    Give Riley lots of attention when he stops barking at your boyfriend, so he  1. Learns that not being aggressive is rewarded  2. You still love him.    Get your boyfriend to give him his meals, and walk him so Riley becomes his dog too, and learns that he isn't a threat.|`|XOT9rHPMaa	Your dog wants to be your only love.  He is male,  Is he neutered?  Secondly have the dog sit before your boyfriend comes in.  Once he behaves and stays calm when he comes in then let your boyfriend reward him with a favorite toy or food reward.  If the dog growls, barks or other wise acts aggressively then leave.  Dogs are social creatures and want to be with us.  If he learns that each time he is aggressive towards your boyfriend you leave he will quickly get the idea that that has an undesirable result.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	It sounds like Riley feels he's your guy and that the BF is a threat to that.  He should be banned from the bed altogether.  If he's allowed on your lap on the couch, he is immediately put on the floor BY YOU if he so much as lifts a lip to your BF.  He'll learn pretty quickly that aggression gets him off your lap and on the floor, where calm behavior keeps him where he wants to be.  I ditto the other poster in having BF be the only one to feed and walk him for the time being.  If he is not neutered, this would be a good time.  It might cut down on his tendency to guard "his" female.|`|yk4S7uuraa	He may have been abused by a guy before you got him. I got a collie from a shelter, and obviously the previous owner had used a broom to beat him, because when someone would pick up a broom to clean, the dog would run into a closet and hide.    Either that, or did your boy friend possibly hit, or kick, this dog?|`|izWi8hfjaa	Dogs know bad guys, its not the dog its your bf.
YfThu5Nxaa	This is my dog's favourite:    http://dogblogonline.com/2006/07/14/live...    You could leave it as a whole cake and decorate with dog biscuits, etc. rather than cutting it up into individual treats. It's got the added bonus of being very good for teeth, coat and getting rid of bad breath, too!
MBFeHS22aa	Take her for a nice long walk!|`|0QTCiCf8aa	Awwww poor baby, maybe try going outside with her... Also, if I taught my dog the word potty so she knows what I want her to do...|`|AA12128656	walk her back and forth over an area you have shoveled- about 15 feet long or so and have her walk fairly briskly. tell her "make potty" over and over.   this always does the trick.  (and if it doesn't, your neighbors will wonder about you...)|`|9O3prIUpaa	It could be that it's too cold out, so I wouldn't freak out yet.  Also, if she's in a different environment that usual she could just be a little stressed.  Check if she's eaten anything today.|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	I would try a walk. A long one.   If that doesn't work out, perhaps potty pads will help.   If she goes in the house somewhere (if she already hasn't) try to no get mad.|`|ObhxytFBaa	do you take her out for walks even tho its cold outside? They like to smell different smells, my dog always goes when she has sniffed other dog toilet. also try making her run alot  its good exercise and could help.|`|20759ce8e8f715cd4d43fc23bca9a608aa	My dog is like that when it snows. We have to shovel the deck and parts of the grass so she will go. Otherwise she will leave a mess on the deck.|`|1ecY1Fmoaa	give dog lots milk it will Go poop  right way, i use do dis all time back in korea with my poodle.|`|qRD4sm3eaa	yeah my puppy also didn't poo this morning since its really icy outside. I took her on a walk though and then she did her business. try talking her on a short walk|`|235185ccc037c43013533142501402eeaa	When dogs encounter new surroundings because their owners have gone away, sometimes this will make them a little irregular. Keep taking him outside and if you can clear an area from ice, snow etc. I would do that as well. Eventually he will go. Only one way out:)
HYpEOdsraa	Don't waste any time - take him to an emergency Vet straight away.  You can never be too careful with a puppy of this age.    Is the vomiting accompanied by diarrhoea or is he just being sick?    If this is Parvo the vomiting will be accompanied with foul smelling diarrhoea and you need an emergency vet immediately to save the puppy's life.  They can become dehydrated very quickly so, if you can, start squirting water into the pup's mouth with a syringe every five minutes.    If the pup is just vomiting it could be caused by something he has eaten.  Have you, for instance, given him any rawhides or people food during the last 24 hours?    Whatever the cause you really need to have him examined by a Vet very quickly.  He will be able to advise you on the correct treatment for your puppy.   Even though you don't have your own Vet the puppy should have been checked out by now.   You will need advice on nutrition, worming and flea control.  You can go to any Vet for this advice.    Good luck.  I hope all is well with him.|`|XUG1r9y8aa	Stop wasting time looking for answers on the internet from strangers! Puppies that small get hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) very quickly and this can be VERY dangerous even lethal to your pet.     You shouldn't have a puppy without having a vet. 7 weeks old is also too young to be separated from the mother. 8 weeks is the minimum age they should be removed from the mother's care.     If you want to make sure your puppy survives CALL A VET NOW.|`|VLy28hJMaa	your puppy probally has parvo its very deadly take him to vet if you dont feed him warm chicken broth your best interst is to go to vet|`|PM23RDycaa	Yeah find the nearest vet pack your pup up and drive to the vet.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You have 2 choices.. 1, call the person you got the dog from and ask  them what you should do... Or call and make a vet appointment. 7 week old puppies should still be with their mom. So the person you bought your puppy from, will not be a good source of information.. You should just plain go to the vet.|`|J5C3WKxfaa	what do you mean you don't have a vet?    get him to the vet as it sounds that he may have parvo which is fatal especially without treatment.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	First of all, you got that puppy way too soon. He should have stayed with his mother until at least 10 weeks old. Second, find a vet now please. Good luck, hope he is ok.|`|YfThu5Nxaa	You should go to a vet, even if you don't have one look one up and just go, they won't turn you away with a sick dog. If you really can't afford it take it to a rescue centre and they might be able to provide some sort of help for you. A puppy this young needs treatment immediately because they are especially vulnerable to infection and disease.
GHAnm9ayaa	Well, duh. of course you can fish in 38 degree weather. People catch in -0 below weather.

I'm not into fishing, at all, but I do know that my husband and son have brought us back trout they've caught on an ice-fishing excursion at -5f !|`|AA11901352	You will have a long day of it.  Temperatures below 50 degree water temperature the fish are still in a state of hibernation and are slower moving not requiring much food.  I was fishing all day yesterday and couldn't even get one bluegill.  It had rained the day before however the water was murkey and only around 43 degrees.  Some of the colder water species are few and far between like the musky but the gills/perch and crappie weren't interested.  Even ice fishing can prove long and tedious.  Water temps at 50 (not air temps ) they will start hitting better.
Hxa0lXb3aa	First you got to get a fresh one. (grocery markets)  Then you should wash it and cut a chunk out. Then heat it for about 15 sec. (to get it moist) Then cut it into bite size pieces for the oscars and your done. (Veggies are used as treats and should be fed twice a week at the max) (Also some fish don't like some food like my guppies don't eat peas)
VxKH7KHmaa	Dogs who are just "pets" aren't for breeding....they have to be more then just that. They must be a working dog and/or a show dog. An outstanding representation of their breed and the only reason to breed would be for the better good and welfare of the Amstaff.    I suggest you hit the books, and research what responsible breeding is all about before deciding to bring more puppies into the world, especially Staffies because there is already alot of them needing homes.|`|PMksnqkxaa	Never.

9w7S2Xv1aa	My father raised and trained labs.  He lived in Oklahoma where the temperature gets above 100 F, and as long as you provide shade and plenty of water they do just fine.  They also lived in South Dakota where the temperature goes down below -110 F, and again they had no problem, but a warm dog house and water that is not frozen is a must.  He raised labs for over 20 years and had no problems.  Hope this helps.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I grew up in Arizona and now live in Alaska and have seen labs in both climates. The dog its self will be climatized to where ever it grows up. He will be used to the Florida climate, but that doesn't mean not to supply him with adequate water and shelter. I would reccomend not leaving it outside for more than a half hour when you are concerned for the weather. In the winter if he is lifting his paws while he is outside then he is probably too cold.|`|hj76FSKdaa	My next door neighbor has a Golden Retriever that is kept outside in a fenced kennel, even throughout the night.  In Eastern Washington (State), the temperatures can get into the teens  and colder with the wind chill.  This dog has grown an incredible coat of fir.  He seems fine.  Of course, he also has an igloo style doghouse to retreat into.    I would be careful with a puppy.  We have an (almost) four month old German shepherd and he sometimes needs to stay outside from 8:30 AM to 2:30 PM, depending on my wifes work schedule.  We bought him an insulated wooden dog house with an electrically heated floor.  He seems to be doing fine.  The temperatures during the day are around 25 degrees.      As for heat, I agree that plenty of water is the key.  There is a drip system your can instill on an outside water faucet that provides water when licked.  Also, you could fill up a big bucket.  But I would be more worried about 100 degree heat and 40 degree weather.
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)     First thing I'd like to say to everyone is that ALL hamsters bite, they've only been "pets" since the 1930s so they're still quite wild.  Although a good breeder breeds for color and characteristics, they also breed for temperement and when you get an animal from a pet store - you're playing hamster roulette - so please don't say "All dwarfs are evil little biters and Syrians (Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda) hamsters are so much sweeter and nicer!    I've helped a lot of pet owners with this issue over the years, and this is great for dwarf (any of the 4 breeds) or Syrian (aka Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda, etc)!    Remember to never wake your hamster up to play! They'll be calmer if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish (and dwarfs are little speed demons so it may try to run up your arm). Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience|`|edIUAbCxaa	bite it back....or just get a new pet|`|azRAjsLZaa	lol you said hell.  get a new hampster|`|MTtMvAZzaa	What kind of hamster is he? because i recall hearing that different breeds of hamsters are more aggressive than others.  I had a russian dwarf for a while when i was kid and when I first got him he would bite occasionally and eventually after a long period of time, He no longer seemed to nip at people. Despite their breed being none for hostility   I think it may just have to be with whether or not he's used to being handled by you or handled even at all   You may also possibly have the scent of food on your hand and he doesn't know any better|`|1EHX6fQ7aa	Hey, :)  I'd advise washing your hands with just warm water before you go to stroke and play with your hamster. The fact he doesn't draw blood means he isn't biting you because he's scared but because he thinks you might be a tasty treat. If you wash your hands with fruity or perfumed soaps this will attract him more to bite you. Same goes if you have just eaten and your fingers smell of food. Hamsters have a very good sense of smell.     If you want to tame him I'd advise talking to him at first to get him used to your voice then hand feed him. Continue to talk so he recognizes your voice with food. You can then start to stroke him and pick him up. He'll probably bite you occasionally but not forever. You just need to get him used to you. Obviously, if your hamster isn't in the mood try not to bother him too much. :) I'd advise having some contact with him at least once a day. He'll be tame soon.    Good luck!! :)|`|3oanK9hkaa	It's normal, but you need to train him not to do that. Here's an article on getting your hamster to stop nipping:|`|WJmxgCXxaa	Some hamster bite.  Did you get him as a baby.  Try just handling him gently.  Don't give him a chance to bit you.  You could always put vinegar or hot sauce on your hands first so if he does get you he will taste something yucky.    Good Luck|`|p5APgWW0aa	You can buy spray from a good pet store that will make your fingers unappealing to him - well you can in the UK anyway!  My gerbils used to be like that, but as they grow up and mature, they often lose habits such as that, unless it is a trait for life.  If it is i would be very gentle with him and give him his favourite treat after you handle him without him biting. This way he will learn that good things come from not biting! This worked for my friend perfectly!    It is very common for any small rodents to bite, especially after tasting blood, but if you follow the tips above, then I'm certain that it will all be alright! Note: Remeber to wash your hands before and after handling your pets!    Good luck, and I wish you and your hammy all the best!|`|AA11765362	the most common reason people get bit is the smell on your hands. if you had food they will smell it and bite you thinking its food. so was your hands with scentless soap before handeling them. do not use fruity hand wash because it will have the same problem. also make sure you use filtered water instead of tap. tap water conains flouride wich will strengthen there teeh. this will make their chew toys less effective causing their teeth to grow longer . this will sometimes result in them biting you and chewing on everything to try and dull them. also when they bite it will hurt alot more. so filter their water and wash your hands. good luck

tFCYaZvRaa	yes, they can be allergic to collars.  It's best to let her be collar free and keep her inside...this will work unless you have other animals that live your home that go outside and might bring fleas in.  the best food for your cat is wellness (dry or wet) whatever your cat is use to.  Many other foods can lead to obesity, which leads to heart problems...also many dry foods have way too much carbs and corn and starches which promote uti (urinary tack infections).  I've been a cat owner for over 17 years and just recently found this out.  Some of my cats in the past have had uti and I didn't know why.  I have 2 maine coon cats currently and since switching their food to wellneww I have not had any problems.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	it could be allergic to something... might be the collar, might be the food...  just because the cat doesn't go outside, doesn't mean that it won't get fleas.  it could have had flea eggs on it before it came into your home, and they've since hatched...    might be a good idea looking into some good quality food for the cat to improve it's coat (if it is the skin that's having issues unrelated to fleas)... pop in to the vet clinic where you take your cat (or one close by) to see what they would suggest...|`|RjyNInW6aa	Could be mite eggs.|`|pF63IMyVaa	my vet said that flea collars are toxic and dangerous for cats so i took them off my cats and used flea powder. she may be scracthing herself and causing herself to bleed.|`|btghmpQhaa	My cats also have blood spots. The main reason why is because they scratch themselves at an irritated area a lot and causes blood. Also when fleas go to the bathroom (lol weird i know) it looks like blood spots. It is probably because of an irritated area. No big deal though.

grXWVPmDaa	hey,    cats get used to the litter tray where ever you put it i would leave it inside for few weeks jus so it knows how to use it but maybe keep it near the door of ur balcony so when u move it out there it wont be to confusing for the lil treasure. cats are normally good with heights but id recomend boring up or putting something in the way to avoid the cat jumpin off if ie: you have a open bar balcony if you get me, i have five cats so have some konwledge of them lol. hope thins is of some help. tania. xx|`|D1FlyZrcaa	i have 2 cats and i have moved the litter box many times. all i do to make sure they know where i put it is pick them up and place them next to it to know where the new place is. they usually check it out and will use it there from then on. never had a problem with that.    if i were you i would just get some arm and hammer kitty litter and go from there. cats are VERY curious and she will try to jump up on your rail on the balcony. no matter how high it is. 15 floors is a long way for kitty to fall if she gets distracted or doesnt realize how far down it is. and just to let you know that even though cats almost always land on their feet they can still get hurt and die if they fall to far and 15 floors is definetly too far.    also i am training my cats to use the actual toilet. it can be done and you wouldn't have to worry about the cat smell. but you should wait a little while before trying that. little kittens dont always have the balance that would be required to do this.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	the kitten shouldn't have any issues if you move the litter box.  but i am going to advise that you not put the litter box out on the balcony for several reasons...    -leaving the screen door open.  it's great that your cat will be able to go in and out... but so will insects, birds, and whatever else. our cat brought a live bird into our apartment once... not fun.  -i have had my cat jump off the balcony.  i'm still uncertain if it was intentional, or if the cat had attempted to chase something (like a bird or an insect) or tried to jump onto the BBQ and miscalculated.  -i have no idea where you live, but where i live, it gets to be -40 in the winter... leaving the patio door open is just not an option.  plus what happens if a huge storm hits and you're not home to close the door?  rain can fall sideways...    if you clean the litter box daily, it shouldn't stink up the place.  i live in a very small apartment, with 2 cats, and the only time it really smelled, was when i went away for 5 days, and wasn't around to scoop out the litter. i also use a litter powder additive, and i also use a scented multi-cat litter.|`|ae2463081bceefeded7bc1d2928595baaa	You can gradually move a litter box (in stages) but I would be wary about a balcony so high up. Cats can fall from some heights and be okay but that's too far. Is there a way to reinforce the balcony so kitty cannot fall through the railing (like you can make it solid for at least part of its height)? Maybe you can get a screen to go around where you put the box especially?    If you're worried about smell or litter, there are some configurations that minimize the potential for trouble. I have a domed box that includes a carbon filter. It's in a back room and I never smell it.     I'm concerned though that kitty will jump up hoping to see from the balcony and will fall. It could happen, if not a typical thing. I don't think I could live with the guilt if it were me.|`|tFCYaZvRaa	I have 2 cats and keep 2 litter boxes inside...if you use clumping litter and scoop the clumps out daily your apartment will not smell and yes, cats are creatures of habit....the ktty will be confused if you move the litter box, also the cat may be afraid of outside noise and my not go outside to the litter box.  Also, cats are funny little creature if they see a bird or an insct...they forget everything else but stalking the prey...it they are on a balcony and start chasing a fly or something, they wont even think about being up high, they will just jump after the insect or bird..or whatever has their attention...this would not be a good thing for you to do.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Here is a web search that can help you out, good luck.    http://www.google.com/search?q=Bringing+...|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	If you are going to take on the responsibility of a kitten/cat you also take on the duties of emptying and cleaning the litterbox.  You don't want to risk the kitten getting confused about where it's litterbox is - once they start going elsewhere they are very hard to retrain.    Your kitten would be in great danger to be free to go out on the balcony whether you are there or not.    A good starter book is the one in the Dummies series which will be handy to have around when you have cat questions.  Please get the kitten/cat from a shelter where the staff or volunteer counselors can give you a good basic education about cat ownership.|`|Xj4bTobUaa	No the cat shouldn't get confused, iv had several kittens and found that once they get use to using a litter tray just keep moving it closer to the door and soon they will understand, cats also like to bury their mess and get upset if they cant and so they will instinctively go for the litter tray or maby a house plant.  As for jumping off the balcony they shouldn't do, cats are great climbers and are aware of heights.  You also need to make sure your cat gets alot of exercise, if it cant go outside you'l need to entertain and play with it alot to make sure they dont become overweight.
y7H1V39Jaa	I believe and live by this:  Use nothing to train your horse that you cannot take into the show ring...there is no gimmick that will replace a good set of hands and a subtle set of legs.  I truly believe that...hands and patience and be quick and subtle to reward a give from the horse with a give from your hands.. There are no quick fixes or magic boxes in which you can fit your horse, you have to see and feel the potential in your horse and develop it with your seat, hands and feet(legs).  There are no shortcuts.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Please do NOT get the Pessoa lounging system. It will lock your horse in to a fake frame and only build up muscling in all of the wrong places which will take ages to correct! To get him off of his forehand you need to get him to realize he has a hind end. He needs to start driving forward from behind, raising his back, and stretching his neck down from the withers, not the crest. I would highly recommend a chambon, which can also be purchased as Dover Saddlery. It is a very simple training device that works by exerting pressure on the horse's poll, not their mouth. When the horse stretches their neck down AND out (which side reins do not allow) it releases the pressure and the horse learns to carry themselves correctly. In just a few weeks you will notice an amazing difference in your horse.

Get a vet or a chiro out to check him out. How old is he?|`|AA11675726	Lunging may help but before I would do that, I would have him checked out to make sure that something isn't hurting.  Is there an equine chiropractor in your area?  Or an equine massage therapist?  When a horse doesn't want to behave (bucking) he's trying to tell you that something isn't right with him.  It could be the bit, it could be he's out of alignment, it could be the saddle doesn't fit properly, it could be that his feet need attention - there are so many things that he could be objecting to - just tackle one thing at a time - you'll find out what is bothering him and why he is bucking.|`|fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	I haven't seen the training system before but I know what you mean with the answers on here.  Nobody reads the question, they pick apart bits of information and respond to that.  I asked a question about self or full care board and sooo many people said move to a different place.  I'm like People! read the question!    Sorry I dont know anything about this system.  I would look up reviews online.|`|I8dkpUQ7aa	I wouldn't suggest the training system--they just restrain the horse and usually make them frustrated and unhappy, and often make the horse's behavior worse. Plus, the second you take the training system off they will go back to their normal ways--it doesn't really teach them anything, it just forces them into a desired position. I suggest getting a trainer to help, since I had lunging problems with my horse, too.
Z2vlRSzpaa	How do you know that your guinea pig is fat? Do you just assume it?    The proper weight for a male guinea pig is 900-1200 grams. And for females it's 700-900 grams.    This guide will help you --->       > One ounce weight fluctuation is OK.   > Two ounces - Go on alert.   > Three ounces - Extreme red alert.   > Four ounces - Get the pig to a vet.    To be sure that your guinea pig is getting the right weight requirements you need to give them ground time. Ground time is when you put your guinea pig in a huge pen or room (with no harmful things example, electric chords, loose hanging objects, etc...

Getting a purebread pitty for under $50 is slim to none.  Unless you search on the internet and get it from an irresponsible owner, and the dog will probably already have issues then too.  If you can't afford a dog, you shouldn't own one.|`|XUG1r9y8aa	A dog costs a LOT more than $50 just in terms of veterinary bills. First off rabies vaccination is required which can only be given by a vet who will charge you an exam. Then add in parvo, distemper, kennel cough, etc.     Add in the fact that if you have a dog and he gets sick (Trust me, ALL dogs get sick,) it will cost you HUNDREDS of dollars to fix if not thousands.     Ignoring the fact that they are sick will earn you a higher vet bill and maybe a fine and jail term if you are caught by the police or the ASPCA for ignoring your dogs health.     If you are worried that you can't pay more than $50 for the dog, DON'T GET THE DOG. Do yourself AND the dog a favor and let someone who has the finances for it adopt. Buy a hamster of a goldfish or something but not a dog.|`|PM23RDycaa	If you can't afford what they are charging at your local shelter you can't afford to have a dog.

They can be very friendly and you can build a trust with them. This can take time though - it all depends on the budgie  3. Yes, you can keep them on their own. I have one budgie - I know she wouldn't want another with her. However, usually budgies will be happy to have a partner. As long as you pay them attention they'll be happy alone.  4. Leave them to fly around for at least a while. If they get tired they will go back in their cage or sit on the outside of it.

G0KKfXMUaa	Head dropping problem-<br>  <br>  Do you mean like looking down at your horse? Or a slouched back?<br>  <br>  Well, you could stick a crop in the back of your pants and focus on sitting tall against it. Or, have someone take you in a round pin, and trot without reins, holding your hands straight out. This way you will have to keep your head up so that you can remained balanced. If done enough, this can help you develop a new habit of keeping your head level, which is good.<br>  <br>  Also, try to focus on staring at something in the distance. It's kind of like jumping a line... you have to stare ahead of the line, not at the jump... or soon your butt will be flat on the ground.<br>  <br>  Other tips for getting back in the saddle-<br>  <br>  Just for the sake of confidence rebuilding, find a more quiet horse that you trust.<br>  <br>  Also, do a lot of no stirrup exercises to help regain a good, strong seat. And with someone in the round pin, depending on how balanced you are when starting back up, you can trot or canter or both without stirrups and without reins (make sure your friend has the horse on the longe line).<br>  <br>  Try to get a trainer for a few lessons so that you don't start out and develop bad habits that feel "right".<br>  <br>  And while you're first starting out... if you do not feel comfortable riding a horse, do not ride it. Because the last thing you need while starting up again is a bad fall.<br>  <br>  Quick tips (if you're riding english?)-<br>  <br>  1. Heels down.<br>  2. Keep good contact between your whole leg and the saddle.<br>  3. Sit tall and deep.<br>  4. Straight back, head up (once you work on that hah).<br>  5. Keep breathing!<br>  6. Keep a tighter rein so that you keep contact with the horses mouth and do not lose control.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	In each direction, pick a spot of the wall or a tree top and STARE at it, don't take your eyes off it until you turn a corner then pick something else ahead of you and stare.

0m6BgESXaa	I'd actually try being LESS hands on with him.  Let him think things through for himself (clicker training is FABULOUS for a lot of dogs).<br>  <br>  Please do NOT knee your dog in the chest, no matter how "gentle" it is. For one, it's giving him what she wants, which is attention (negative attention is still attention). Either turn your back and only reward him when he has four on the floor (this can be sitting OR standing!), or stand in front of him with your arms crossed and just look at him. Say nothing. When he sits or stands without bouncing, quietly praise "Good dog" and give him a cookie.<br>  <br>  Exuberant dogs do not need happy high pitched praise, but a more zen and focused approach. Something calm and smooth.<br>  <br>  I actually recommend starting "down" from a STAND and not a sit so the dog does not become pattern trained. Take a cookie and place it near the dog's nose. Gently bring the cookie down and back, so the dog must put his front down before he puts his back end down. This is a far more efficient drop than teaching the dog to "Crawl" forward from a sitting position. It also teaches the dog that down means down, not sit then lay down. They are always allowed to lick and sniff the cookie, even nibble on it, but don't give them the whole thing until they have complied with your command.<br>  <br>  People also fail to realize how important a "stand" command is. Teaching the stand is ridiculously easy. From a sit or a down, take a cookie and pull it away from the dog. He'll have to stand up to get it, and all you'll need to do is tell him "stand". Why is this command useful? It keeps your dog from sitting in mud or a puddle when on a walk, it is VERY useful for examination at the vets office, and it can even save your dog's life!<br>  <br>  Watch - I know you didn't ask for this command, but it's an important one. If you don't have eyes, you don't have ears (this is also where "heel" starts). Start by holding a cookie in front of your face and say "Puppy, watch me!" The moment your dog looks into your eyes (not the cookie, but YOUR EYES!) say "Yes!" and give them a treat! They will start by only looking at you for a split second, so be quick! By teaching your dog to focus on you, they'll tune in better and be willing to listen. In the end, you want something that looks like this:<br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/..." rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/..." rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/..." rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/..." rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/..." rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a>|`|TcJVVurzaa	watch it's me or the dog on animal planet, later in the show, there's a link for the internet so to take a test. If you pass, she'll come come to your house to train your dog|`|mjKIV9Toaa	You, hands him  from an instructor or to a breeding (if it is of race, if it is not of race it allows to lose).<br>  it take a lot of patience with the dogs!<br>  <br>  Excuse for the errors, i am italian =D|`|C5YBD3F1aa	For the jumping- everytime he jumps onto you, use one of your legs and move his back legs so he falls. Tell him "off". Then, make him sit, and give him a treat.<br>  <br>  It is much easier for a dog to learn his/her commands in you use one word.<br>  <br>  Lay down: "down".<br>  Sit: "Sit".<br>  Get off/down: "Off".<br>  Stay: "Stay".<br>  Leave it: "Leave".<br>  Heel: "Heel".<br>  Backup: "Back".<br>  Come here: "Come".<br>  And so on. They get easily confused whenever you use more than one word.<br>  <br>  And whenever you train a dog to sit, don't push their butt down. It usually makes the dog think "she touches my butt, I stay down until I get the treat". What you do is when he is standing still, move your hand over the top of his head so he will have to look up at your hand. Keep going farther back until your dog is forced to sit so he can see the treat. This sounds confusing in words, I could make a few training videos and put them on here if that would make it easier.<br>  <br>  And, for "down" (lay down), make him learn sit first. Then, put him in the sitting position, and move your hand directly down from the point of his nose between his legs. When he tries to nudge your hand or try getting the treat, he will find it is difficult and will require standing up, a lot of strugling, or laying down. If he stands up, put him back in the sit position and try again. If he keeps strugling and won't lay down, keep moving your hand a little farther under his belly, until he HAS to lay down to get it. Make sure to give plenty of rewards!<br>  <br>  For leave it, I am not completely sure. I have never had to train my dog to leave anything alone. lol. I have always been lucky and had good puppies that never chewed things up very much and always had good manners. Now they are all grown up. :P But, I am sure that you could teach him leave it by putting something tempting in front of him, then if he tries to get it, tell him "leave" and gently nudge his nose away from it. Then give him a treat for every 2 seconds that he doesn't touch it. Keep increasing the time; every 4 seconds, every 8 seconds, every 15 seconds, every 25 seconds, every 40 seconds, every 55 seconds, every minute, and so on. <br>  <br>  And for stay, well, I can't really explain that one.<br>  <br>  I will try to make some training vidoes later and post them on Youtube, I will give you the link to them if you want. (:|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Sounds like you getting along very well and have a very trainable dog. Try clicker trainig, I explain it on my web site and there are some articles that are worth reading for basic obedience.
SXfFI05Gaa	They do.<br>  A harness is good, and so is a play-pen. Make sure there's no chemicals in the grass!<br>  They like to munch-and-walk.|`|K71Qoakwaa	They might wander off, and they have no homing instinct and could get lost.  Also, you should be there to deter possible predators.  But they like being outside since they can graze nonstop.|`|NBDQRBvzaa	yeah they do they like to chew on the grass. mine were very lazy so they wouldnt run much they would rather walk haha|`|ivejg4whaa	Yes but make sure that the weather is warm and that you don't lose em'!|`|qmfW6CQBaa	Guinea pigs do like to run around, though when they do be sure it's in a clean and well fenced in enviornment :)|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Actually yes they do but be sure there is no harm! But i would definitely recommend a harness.|`|q0rLBQo2aa	They don't run, they waddle. Coming from the high Andes with few or no natural predators, they are A) incredibly stupid, and B) extremely vulnerable to heatstroke. <br>  Being a brainless bag of jelly beans, they must be watched very carefully lest they blunder into trouble. Not being very expressive of emotion, they won't show the heat stress until they fall over ploppo-dead. <br>  Sorry not to love your choice of pet -- they might as well be a stuffed animal, except then they wouldn't eat and poop -- but the warnings ARE genuine.
kqa9VFrfaa	YES   It was very funny after I figured it out, but it took me a while, because the dog in question was so clever. I had a Samoyed female named Velvet, who was very spoiled. I loved her very much and she knew it. One day I was talking on the phone, and she walked into the kitchen where I was at. She just stood there for a moment, and then began gagging like she was going to throw up. Of course I quickly got off the phone and took her outside to the backyard, where I hovered over her thinking she was sick. <br>  About a week or two went by, and the very same thing happened. I am on the phone -- the dog comes in the room and sees me --- dog acts sick and I hang up fast and go out with her. She gags and coughs and I worry about her. Then she tried this a third time a few days later, and guess what? She forgot to carry on her gagging routine after we got outside. The third time she forgot to be the little actress, and stopped gagging as she went thru the doorway & out onto the porch. That is when my light bulb went off in my head. <br>  The 4th time she tried this, I was on the phone and I told her to knock it off and go lay down. She looked at me with those big brown eyes and stopped gagging and went across the room and laid down until I got off the phone.|`|GSf09ALBaa	No. Dogs do not 'act' sick to get 'attention'.  If a dog is vomiting, has diarrhea, is not eating etc.  That is not to get attention.  Only the human species is capable of this.|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	YES!! I backed a chair onto my dogs paw one time, I fed her steak after cause I felt so guilty, the next day she kept limping, only she started to switch paws on me we went to the beach and she was using both paws to dig in the sand, but when he walked back to the car, she started limping again, smart little monsters...|`|24CFl7sjaa	To be honest I doubt that a dog would have the thought processes to work out that if they faked a sickie they would get attention.<br>  They either are sick, or they aren't.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	No if anything, dogs downplay how sick they are.  They don't like to show weakness - that's the natural reaction of most animals when they are sick.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	none of my dogs.<br>  but i had a horse once that would act lame if he didn't want to go riding.|`|zjeED3YOaa	yes actually. my pomeranian has some disease called 'Addisons' and its kind of like they go into depression and they get flu symptoms. its basically because she wants more attention and had separation anxiety. mine is very mild and rarely happens, but there are medicines to help cure it if your dog does this alot. consult a vet first!|`|cpxkROqMaa	Is your dog home alone all day? They are pack animals and don't like to be alone. We have two dogs and that helps. They always have a friend.|`|euwbbibZaa	I really have never heard of that before.

1D8tMCYIaa	I think you are supposed to put the temperature up by a few degrees and add some marine salts, but you need to figure out how much.<br>  <br>  Go to fishlore.com and ask in the forums. They have some experts there.|`|AA11901352	First off melafix won't cure anything you have here.  Ich is a parasite that is already in the water.  It will only attach itself to stressed or immune dificient fish.  Ich meds like anti parasitic are needed to cure ich.   If it is a fungus you need an anti fungual.  Melafix is an antibacterial and doesn't "cure disease" and it is not an antifungual or anti parasitic.<br>  <br>  If it was white mold, it could just have been from rotting food that had gathered in the tank.  Remove it by hand.  You need to treat for ich since it will kill your fish faster than the fungus.<br>  <br>  You will also want to use 1/2 doses since you have small guppies in the tank.  Remove the carbon filter and treat as directed.  Once you treat for the ich and it has cleared then treat for the fungus.<br>  <br>  Have you done your water change?  You need to stick to a weekly 25% water change and for no reason do a 100%.  Right now your tank is going thru the cycle process all over again.  TEST your water daily while treating your fish.  Do a water change when you see the ammonia spiking or you will never get rid of the ich.|`|PGQoh45Uaa	Dude are you serious,<br>  my fish had a terrible death,<br>  he died of thirst!|`|LBg4DNpCaa	I just had all my fish die from ich except my iridescent shark and my pleco. They died today because of the treatment. I would say all your fish are infected and dont get your hopes up on them saying alive.

SzW9GmRsaa	If she's a decent and kind pony you'd probably do well in Pony Club Pony - it doesn't matter if she dishes so long as she looks after you and is willing to give things a go.  Most PCP classes have a small jump which she would have to jump sweetly without rushing, running out, refusing, or need to be bribed over - which if you are doing SJ shouldn't be too big a problem for you.<br>  <br>  Unless she is a native she really should be pulled and plaited, although for a few local shows you might be able to get away with a running plait.  If you have no plans to go further than local showing it seems a shame to pull when you are so proud of it, but do be aware that it's not really correct and you may be marked down a little for it.<br>  <br>  You don't have to be in Pony Club to show a PCP, although many people are.  You just have to have a pony who would be suitable as a clubber - ie calm, confident and forgiving.|`|JG7W0qvcaa	Ohh Well You Could Do Tack And Turnout If You Had Decent Tack Rather Than My Brick :P And I Could Plait :)<br>  <br>  They Won't Bother Too Much About The Dishing Don't Worry ;)<br>  <br>  You Won't and neither will Suzi ;)<br>  <br>  leave it wavy :D<br>  <br>  Try Not To Go In Veteran At *** Boots ;)<br>  <br>  I Also Like White Speckle Head As A Show Name :)<br>  <br>  Love You<br>  <br>  x x x x  x x|`|wKCgaoZVaa	They say its polite to plait your horse, but I think Arabs look better with flowing manes and tails.

It is used on long-maned horses, and is usually seen either when a baroque horse breed competes in dressage, or in hunter and dressage classes for horses that are otherwise required to show with a long, full mane. <br>  -The Continental braid, also called a "macrame braid" is also useful for long-maned horses, and creates a "net" in the mane. It isn't a "braid" per se, as it is usually made up of simple knots or even simply created with rubber bands or yarn, but is periodically viewed as stylish in some dressage and flat classes, particularly those in breed shows for horses that have naturally long manes. <br>  -The scalloped mane is a less common form of braiding, where the braids are not pulled up in half under itself, but rather pulled up under the braid that is two down from it (toward the withers). It is seen most often in hunt seat, dressage, or in the jumpers, although it is not as popular as the other forms of braid. It is useful for manes that may look bulky in traditional braiding styles because they are a bit too thick or a bit too long.|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	I personally think that long manes belong in the pasture not the show ring.  If you dont like the cut off look, try having someone braid her mane (it looks great for show but requires a short thin mane).<br>  <br>  Tails always look best just like hers, long and full.  Wash and brush it out so that it is as full looking as possible and leave it down.  Braided tails don't look nearly as nice in the ring.<br>  <br>  If her tail is touching the ground, you need to trim it before jumping with it down, at least 2 inches off the ground.|`|JOncNt6qaa	Do an arab plait, it's really easy and instantly looks smart.
iy3NISVGaa	My old mare had similar symptoms a few years ago. She was dehydrated and had an infection in the kidneys.<br>  The Vet gave her medication and I now have to give her 1 desert spoon of tables salt in each feed to encourage her to drink more. This then stimulates the kidney function and re-hydrates her.<br>  <br>  Old horses, like old people often don't drink enough. They also require careful management and special dietary needs are often present. A good quality mineral supplement and a salt lick ( I put mine in the manger so  she automatically has a lick when feeding) should be given.<br>  <br>  My mare also often looks tired and just stands around. But she still rolls in the thickest mud in the field, bosses my other 2 mares and can, albeit stiffly, have a good canter and buck. She is now 28.( In my profile picture at the rear on the right)|`|RloOJ43haa	You want people who have never seen the horse and cannot see the horse to second guess a vet who examined the horse first hand? Really?<br>  <br>  Vets go through years of education to become learned in their field. If the vet says that it is a sign of liver cancer, then it probably is a sign. There are probably lab tests that can be done to verify the presence or absence of cancer.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Liver disease, not necessarily cancer, does make the urine dark and the poos pale.

This called jaundice, a general term for liver damage.<br>  <br>  He could also have a virus - my horse did this - very active, greedy and well rounded and suddenly went very ribby despite a healthy appetite to begin with and then suddenly went off his feed.  He turned out to have a virus.  Clean water must always be available to try and find if he might be just dehydrated, another cause for dark urine.<br>  <br>  Or, it could be a bladder problem.  <br>  <br>  However, your vet will have done the necessary tests and will know best what to do.|`|vea6mqPZaa	When was the last time it was hit with some panacure or tube wormed?<br>  Was there a feed change?<br>  Check its feed and see if its spoiled<br>  Is it eating, if not check its moth for sores or sharp points on its teeth.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am wagering its a double dose of worms that have drug it down or a bladder infection.<br>  <br>  My first action if it where mine would be to hit it with panacure, give it a 20cc slug of penicillin in the morning, 10cc in the evening and about 10cc of B12 complex.

YqVtOSWwaa	The ink on the boxes is not too great for them to eat, but what I have found is that they only shred cardboard, and do not swallow too much. I use boxes for hiding places for all my mice and rats, so there should not be a problem with hammies. Just be sure to remove all of the plastic from the boxes. This is dangerous.    Here are some sites to homemade hamster toy ideas:  http://www.geocities.com/taffy3001/homem...  http://www.shmat.com/hamster-toys/  http://www.hamsterhideout.com/forum/inde...    Just remember to never use cloth or fluffy material. These are choking hazards.|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Tissue boxes make great hideouts and chew toys for hamsters!  Just make sure that you remove any plastic from the rim of the box first!    Some tips on keeping your hamster entertained!    The best way to keep your hamster from getting bored is to change things up in their cage once a week. Not their house, food, water - but their toys and treats.      Be aware that sugary treats and all fruits should be avoided with dwarf hamsters as they're prone to diabetes.  They can be given in moderation to Syrian (Teddy Bear, Honey Bear, Golden, Panda) hamsters - but still don't go overboard with them as it can still affect their teeth - remember, they can't brush their teeth!    Hamsters get bored very very easily. A giant box full of different toys,a bowl of chinchilla bath sand (not dust!), a maze made out of paper towel and TP tubes are all fabulous ideas. You can get a really big plastic bin at any big store like Walmart or Target for under $10. A big thick cardboard box with even more walls and doorways made of cardboard can be even better because it's free - just be sure you check it before you place the hamster in each time for any holes or signs of potential holes :)    Place your hamster in his or her "play zone" whenever you want to play with it. Hide treats in the tubes so they can be discovered. You can make homemade wooden toys out of interlocking craft sticks that look like popsicle sticks - and they're great for their teeth as well.    Hamsters love to run around in an empty bath tub as well! Put the plug in, or cover the drain with a piece of cardboard so paws don't get trapped and never leave them unattended.    With chinchilla bath sand - not the dust as they can breathe it in too easily - you'll want to place the packet of sand in the bowl.  Place the bowl either into their new play area, a larger bowl, or on top of some newspaper or toweling.  They will roll flip and dig in it so you'll want something under it to catch any mess and make cleanup easier.    An idea from Stubby McMini and her hamster (I give credit where credit is due - and this is a fabulous idea!):    "...he also has a homemade 'maze' that he adores.... I got a big cardboard box and put in 'walls' theres a room with soft bedding and treats hidden, some steps, a couple of arch doorways, toilet roll tunnels, a bish bash room.... he loves it, though he does try to climb over the side so you have to watch him carefully!"    I love her idea!  She's also very very correct about never leaving your hamster unattended no matter where it is when it's outside its cage, including when they're in their balls!    Speaking of their little roll-a-thon balls.  Make sure that you have an appropriate sized ball for your hamster!  Syrians need the larger balls, dwarfs *must* have the smaller ones or it can cause serious back problems for either one.  Color makes no difference to a hamster as they're color blind, but the clear ones will make it a lot easier on them to look through as far as getting around. Not as cute for us to watch, but easier on your hamster!    Have fun!|`|h8l1H4N4aa	I just need to add one more thing to the other answers.  Tissue boxes are put together with a lot of glue.  Even tho they will not swallow much while chewing it up, the glue wouldn't be healthy for your hamster.|`|59AiKKuCaa	im not sure if ittl be safe if he eats it because it has patterns on as you said.   you can make chew toys out of bread crusts.  put them in the oven for 1/2 hours so they are rock hard.  let them cool and give them to the hamster.  use loo rolls for hamsters.|`|6i1NM95Haa	they are fine except they wont last long (as you know they chew) A good toy is lollipop (popsicle) sticks make good toys. or toilet tubes|`|7AI58IS8aa	Yes it works really well, because I use it for my hamster too. But she always stands on top of the box and poos, so I have to change it every week. lol     I get one when I'm done with the tissue box, and I cut it in half, so I have two mini sleeping boxes for my hammie.
I8Tahe4Jaa	I've seen people dump wood chips into the muddiest spots. I've heard of resurfacing with pea stone or fine gravel to allow for better drainage, but that's fairly expensive. I've also had sucess with stall mats in the gateway. <br>  <br>  I, too, have a horse that was notorious for losing shoes in muddy fields. Eventually, we found that the best solution was to get his feet up to par and remove the shoes permanently.<br>  <br>   If your horse is unable to go barefoot for conformational or lameness issues, you'll just have to get creative with your fencing and occasionally move the gate (if it's electric) when you notice its starting to get swampy or rotate pastures! Areas like the gate, hay feeders and water trough have a lot of daily traffic, which is why they get muddier quicker. You can talk to your farrier about shoeing options that help with keeping them on. Invest in a metal detector, too! Saved me hundreds finding lost correctional shoes beneath the mud.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	I had a mare like this too only she had navicular and she had to have shoes as well to help her out.<br>  <br>  What we did and I don't know if you have one but for the time being until the mud goes away I would put her in a round pen and keep her there until the mud goes away. That is IF your round pen is at a good mixture of sand, rocks and dirt.<br>  <br>  Straw can cause a lot of problems, not only with footing but with rot too. What we have done to some of our really muddy areas are put gravel down to fill the muddy areas and then put sand over the top of it.<br>  <br>  It worked out for us rather well. Another thing you can do is take fencing (electrical because its easy to put in and take out and fence off the area around the mudd. And make another gate if its possible. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|BI1GbIZUaa	Straw works well in the short term. You could also build the area up with gravel and put a heavy stall mat on top. This has worked really well at the barn I teach lessons at. All you have to do is make sure mud doesn't start to build up on top.|`|e193294baa8d6ba952ee479ba5e75b52aa	Yes i use straw for mud and it wount turn to brick unless you are in a ery warm envoroment with lots of sun.  You could also lay down boards were the horses walk.|`|kixQWODVaa	my barn and the area around it use to flood really bad and after the water went away we were left with a lot of mud.  I had the opposite problem my mares were fine but my gelding had shoes on and the suction of the mud would pull them off and ruin is hoof wall(he doesn't grow hoof well).  We started keeping shoes off of him so he could grow his wall out(you might consider this).  To fix the problem we used rail road ties burred about 5 or six inches and filled the area with a dump truck load of dirt to stop the water from going into that area completely.  It was a little work but it did not cost very much because we did the work our selves.  We tried to put hay and straw down but it just made the area squishy and the hay becomes a worse mess to clean up once it starts to rot.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!!|`|r16LLAzVaa	Putting down straw or hay is a bad idea. It soaks up the water and retains it in the ground for much longer. By the time the ground starts to dry you will find the mud with straw/hay in is still squishy. Believe me I know from past experience! It works for a quick fix, but is a pain to have to clear up as the hay/straw starts to rot. As the others have suggested, the only real solution would be to put some gravel down, or a layer of sand for drainage, then woodchippings or gravel. I did use electric fencing one year and kept moving it to different parts of the gate area so they were not stood and cutting up the same place continually. It is a pain though. Mud in the winter, flies in the summer, us horse owners never have an easy ride!

Engage her in some kind of game or offer her a treat.....let her think it's her idea to leave the litter box.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	There isn't really anything you can do. That's her turf, so to speak. Just leave her be and she might out grow it. It's just another little quirk that cats have. Aren't they just wonderful little critters?
8F5t3DhKaa	Behavior wise, rats are the best by far. They don't bite, are easily trainable, and are over-all, just plain friendlier. Gerbils are cool, they are fun to watch, but if you wake them up during the day (they are nocturnal) they can get a little snippy. I am the least educated about mice, but I am pretty sure that pet wise, gerbils or rats are over-all better. Mice don't live NEARLY as long as gerbils or rats, so if you are looking for a short term pet, mice are for you. Gerbils are like any other small pet, and i've heard that having a rat is like having a small dog. (Because of their trainable nature and friendliness) <br>  All-in-all, if I had the choice, I would probably get a rat. :)|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Live together as in rats with mice??? No!! Live together with their own species, yes they are ALL social species and they should all have the company of a same sex friend, or opposite sex neutered friend.<br>  <br>  Rats make the best pets. They are larger and thus easier to handle and cuddle. They are sweet, smart, intelligent, loveable and adorable, and very, very funny. They are called the dogs of the rodent world because they become so tame they learn their names, they learn tricks, and they will follow you around your house if you let them. Rats seldom bite, although having said this neither mice nor gerbils are prone to biting either. Male rats are friendly, lazy and cuddly, females are also friendly but more hyper and only cuddly when they run out of adventure steam. if you want rats you need a VERY large cage, google the Freddy 2 or Ferplast Jenny rat cage to see the sort of size you need...80cmX50xmX80 is a good size for a pair, rats need the bar spaces close together and tall cages so they can climb. They also need an hour at least of free roaming time out of the cage every day to interact with you and play. 2-3 hours is better though.<br>  <br>  Gerbils and mice are nice and cute, of the 2 I'd say gerbils because mice are adorable but they STINK and are so small they are difficult to handle, and are escape artists. A good cage for either is a 3 foot long aquarium with a vivarium lid, which the company clearseal will do. Neither gerbils or mice will become as tame and friendly as rats though, and rats really are loads more fun.|`|JNnSMh64aa	No they cannot live together.<br>  <br>  I personally like rats, but mice are cool too.<br>  <br>  Here are some pics:<br>  <a href="http://www.pets747.com/uploaded_images/pet-rats-717618.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets747.com/uploaded_images/p...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://misseccles.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_3442.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://misseccles.files.wordpress.com/20...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dkimages.com/discover/previews/928/50023141.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview...</a>|`|sFUeytNTaa	<a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Rats_Vs_Mice_as_Pets" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Rats_Vs_Mice_as_...</a> <br>  rats are better definately. if u do get rats remember to get two - a single rat can get bored, lonely and depressed. 2 rats are the same cost and effort and much more fun.|`|y0fmBIP2aa	None of them can live together! Of all those, rats are the best. They're basically cats. Mice are not as great as some people say. They're smelly and not very friendly. Gerbils are the same as mice, just bigger.
h4wNRqf9aa	The "length to volume" "rule" is fallacious<br>  <br>  Though the tank doesn't sound horribly stocked, pretty reasonable<br>  <br>  The temp should be around 25C and the snails will be fine with the frogs|`|QrjjiOgTaa	get rid of the serpae tetras, they are fin nippers even in a school. i have sceen them murder neons. make sure the frogs get sinking foods, temp should be in the mid to high 70s. stock slowly and get other species of tetras if you want like black skirt, white skirt, black neon, pristella, orange von rio, x-ray belly, lemon, or diamond tetra. other options are dianos, zebra, blue zebra, gold zebra, peal, or glow. cherry barbs are a nice addition too.|`|MFZr5yhAaa	yes apple snails and frogs are compatable. but I worry about the frogs bc, they need to be able to get to the surface, and if your tank is too tall it can cause problems. Sometimes adding plants that the frogs can get to the top help. And like others said, they need to be fed differant from the others to ensure they are getting food.<br>  <br>  You are doing a great thing by researching it all first, it'll save you loads in the end. Dont get too excited tho, add the fish slowly. Like go get one group at a time. Wait a few weeks, then go back. Im assuming you have already cycled your aquarium. Which fish to choose first is up to you completely.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	The dwarf frogs will get along ok, but the only caution I would have is that they tend to be a slow eater, and need to be fed sinking foods. They tend to have a hard time finding the food before everything else in the tank. Other than that, it looks great.<br>  <br>  Stock slowly though. Stocking too fast will cause ammonia levels to go high.|`|f5tbPLq1aa	i would definitely have to say- be careful about the gouramis b/c they killed all my plants just about. they munched until they DIED. haha. I am not too sure about the frogs and the snails, but I'm sure they'd be ok together depending on the size of the snails, don't get them too small, and be careful they'll multiply!! :) have fun and sounds like its going to be a beautiful set up!|`|yXDtGo8taa	I would stay away from the frogs with as many fish as you are getting unless you have a REALLY tightly sealed aquarium!
LxqJ138Uaa	Respiratory infection, add a heat pad on one end of the tank (not directly under the lamp) all you need is UVB light and pad. They like to come out early and bask to kill bacteria. They need to be at either 60 degrees (hybernation temps) or keep at about 80 degrees. hope he gets better.|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	it probably is hissing all snakes hiss if scared or angery|`|b3pRYXkUaa	if it is when u try to hold her  then she is upset and if u keep bothering her when shes doing that then she will bite if it when your not holding her or going to then it is a respotery problem|`|lGDdDq6waa	Then TAKE COVER! and use your baby as a shield!
2Ku4DuvCaa	I'm going to be honest with you- if you can't handle the behavior issues of a parakeet, what makes you think you can handle a conure? Conures have their moments too, except when they bite you it's going to hurt a lot more.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to the person who told you to pull away your hand when your parakeet nips at it. In fact, doing that will teach your parakeet that he can control you by nipping at you. Instead of moving your hand away from him when he pecks at you, just keep your hand close to him and say, "Step up." He's just a parakeet, he's not capable of hurting you too bad.<br>  <br>  Parakeets generally have a "cuddly" phase when they're young, and some of them will grow out of it a little. That doesn't mean he won't be your friend anymore, it just means he won't want to cuddle as much as he used to. Also, parakeets are flock animals. They are hard wired to try to become the leader of their flock at a certain age by trying to control the other members of their flock. He recognizes you as another member of his flock. He's trying to control you by nipping at you.<br>  <br>  When he nips, tell him "no" in a stern voice (but don't yell) and say "Step up." When he does step up onto your hand, SMILE and tell him what a good boy he's been! He might not understand your words, but he'll understand your facial expression and your tone. <br>  <br>  If you're patient and persistent with him, he'll learn that you're the flock "leader" and that he should do as you say. That doesn't mean he'll suddenly want to cuddle with you all of the time again. For some parakeets, that's just a part of growing up.<br>  <br>  A conure would give you similar issues if you let it. And by asking this question at all, it's evident that you don't know a whole lot about proper bird care and training. I would advise you to work with your parakeet and do your research on proper care and training before you even CONSIDER bringing another bird into your house.<br>  <br>  Also be aware that if you bring a larger parrot into your house, he may not decide to be friends with your parakeet. Just because they're both birds doesn't mean they'll automatically like each other. I have an African Grey and a Senegal that will actually glare at each other from across the room, and the only thing keeping them from fighting each other is the knowledge that the leader (me) will give them twenty minutes in time out and no treats for the day as a result. That just goes to show that not all birds will be friends.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be mean, I'm trying to get you out of this mindset that getting another bird will make everything okay. <br>  <br>  By the way... if you use proper grammar and break your sentences up into paragraphs, they become a lot easier to read and understand. You can't get a good answer without an understandable question, can you?|`|ns9NqKXzaa	What a horrible thing to say. I reported that as abuse -.-<br>  <br>  You're lucky your parakeet lets you do that! Mine don't. :(<br>  Has this been happening for a while or just a few days?<br>  He might be ill and a bit cautious - for example, my budgies get scared when they see leaves falling outside and as a results if I try and pet them then, they peck etc...<br>  If it continues and if he isn't acting like himself, take him to a vet - you never know what's going on inside.<br>  <br>  :) Hope this helps a bit.|`|sM6V9tjXaa	you just need to give him/her love and attention and he/sjhe should get used to u. when he pecks dont pull your hand back fast your he will keep doing it to get your hand away. hope this helps
G0KKfXMUaa	From personal experience, and I'm not just trying to be on your good side.... but you are totally right.<br>  <br>  When taking a break from riding for so long, especially due to confidence issues, it is best to start on a push button horse who is practically bomb proof. This way you gain self confidence and can have faith in the fact that you know what you're doing... Only then will you be able to ride more difficult horses to help you advance.<br>  <br>  I say get a new instructor and explain to him or her about your confidence issues and the way you would like to start out.<br>  <br>  And if you can't find a new trainer, then just explain how you feel to one of the instructors.<br>  <br>  But, please, if you do not feel good about it... do not ride that pony. The last thing you need is to get so nervous that you have a fall. When you fall from no self confidence.... it's sometimes really hard to get back in the saddle.<br>  <br>  Good luck =) And be careful!|`|8bTder08aa	I have two conflicting feelings here:  <br>  <br>  First, you're the customer and the customer is always right, if you want a calmer pony your trainer should allow you to ride one.<br>  <br>  Second, when you pay an expert to give you expert advice or instruction, you're throwing your money away if you refuse to take the advice or heed the teachings of the expert you've hired.<br>  <br>  Those two things conflict, I know.  Which leads me to think that maybe you need to either talk to this trainer and make very clear to her that your goal is to rebuild your confidence, and that you don't believe that riding a "fast, unstable" pony is going to do that;  or you need to find a different trainer who you trust more.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you can get things to work out.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	You have to ride a horse that challenges you.  But it sounds like with just getting back in the saddle after some years off, the quiet horse is enough of a challenge.  Even if he's not really technically challenging for you to handle, you're just getting your position and seat and timing back.  That's challenge enough.  You can't worry about technically good riding if you're just trying to keep up and avoid an accident.  <br>  <br>  I would explain this to the instructor, and if they can't understand this, maybe a different instructor/farm would be in order....|`|399a8fa473de5d15a43bd5b6a030fc5eaa	I think until you have your confidence back stick with a quieter horse....Just not forever like some people I've worked with.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	You need to ride an easy going horse that knows what to do even if you don't.  This is how the real riders train.  The older horses teach the inexperienced riders and the experienced riders teach the young horses.  That's my rule of thumb. Whenever I am helping out a new rider I put them on the calmest and usually oldest horse from the herd. <br>  <br>  Especially since you are having confidence problems you gotta speak out and tell them your fears.  Say in a nice manner "I'm sorry but I want to ride a horse that I feel more control in."  <br>  <br>  This way you build up your confidence and move at your pace.  Not everyone is ready for a "fast" horse, but you will get there through training.<br>  <br>  The trainers will be appreciate you being honest with them, if they don't agree with you then you shouldn't put yourself in danger and find another place to ride.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	It is very very wrong to put you on a horse you feel uncomfortable on. The second instructor obviously agrees with the tough love approach but if you have confidence issues there's no way you should be on a horse like that. At some point you will need to learn to handle difficult horses but noone else can tell you when you are ready to do that. Stand your ground and do NOT get on that horse if you dont want to.|`|vea6mqPZaa	I come from the camp of just get on it and ride.<br>  <br>  Now with that said, if you are afraid of the horse it will know it and it will use it to its advantage. You have to not be afraid of it, you have to know you are in charge, it has to know you are in charge.<br>  <br>  If you feel afraid of the animal do not ride it.|`|ikBEORfqaa	she's wrong. you're getting back into it and need a confidence builder, not a horse that wrecks your nerves. later you can be challenged when you get your seat, legs, and confidence back. stand your ground on this one.|`|bFcNsjJwaa	tell your instructor how you feel. she may come across as harsh and scary but she doesnt know how you feel until you tell her and im sure she can help.|`|UFhrD7DWaa	your right|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	Your trainers are paid professionals and you are the client.  They work FOR YOU.  You need to sit down with both of them and explain that you are nervous about riding again and you need to do things your way for a little while.  Tell them flat out that you want a slow, calm, trustworthy old school horse, and that you do NOT want to ride the pony again.  You need to be striaght with them and discuss your options.  You are in charge, if they are not willing to help you, there are MANY other barns with wonderful trainers who will work with you your way.
AUJ6uG0oaa	I would only suggest that you look beyond the "beads and braids" aspect.  There are a lot of trainers out there that say they train with those methods because they are in fact Native American, but that is their only qualification.  Those types of methods are still used, and there are some trainers out there that employ those methods, or variations of them.  They are hard to find, and it still requires a lot of trial and error on your part.  That type of riding is very difficult.  Although most would brush bareback riding off as a hobby or relaxing riding method, to do it properly takes a lot of work and practice.<br>  <br>  Start working with your horse and building a bond with your horse.  Find a good local trainer who uses methods you agree with - not necessarily Native American methods.  When you get hung up on something, ask for help.  Training a good bareback mount is as much about teaching yourself to ride again as it is teaching the horse.  So it is best to work with the horse and work your way through it yourself - but having a relationship with a local trainer can help you get by those little hang ups that will occur.<br>  <br>  Stolen horses  -vs- stolen land....  I think the Natives got the short end of the stick on that one.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	All of these "natural horsemanship" guys pretty much do the same thing, but to be honest Gawani Ponyboy is not the best of them, I would go with Monty Roberts.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day all you have to do is use your common sense and listen to your horse and learn to understand his body language and nature as a flight animal, and use it to communicate with him. You dont need to buy a load of twenty dollar books or sign up to expensive parelli schemes to do that. Using all your senses will work just as well, for free.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	gawani  ponyboy.com  is native american training.  same as josh and john lyons. it is all the same philosophy.|`|OExRcpgAaa	If you have a lot of time riding you will do just find.Shire's are a very good  well minded horse.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	That's the way I ride. First off understand Indians rode saddles. Yes, they had good seats and inspite of riding bareback like they had velcro on their butts, they needed stirrups just like anybody else when it came to doing anything horseback besides just ride. The single greatest advancement in the history of warfare was the invention of the stirrup. The stirrup makes the horse a platform. <br>  An Indian pad saddle is relatively easy to make. Comanches got the horse early and they just copied the Spanish pad saddles they got when they got the horse. e-mail me and I'll be glad to help you with any details I can.|`|rTSwouqXaa	American Indian horsemanship????? I don't agree with that. stealing Government horses and mules as well as scalping innocent white men and women is sure to get you arrested.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way that is how the majority of the American Indians got their horses.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit- Kickin' The Indian made his fight, and Indians didn't own land. And the to the conqueror goes the spoils. And that is the way the world has always worked. The only thing I am pointing out is there is no real ''new'' training methods. There is no real ''new'' or ''better'' training methods, just different training methods.  There is NO right way to train a horse but there are a LOT of wrong methods.
XEbe4Votaa	Based on what you described, I think you did about as much as you could have.  <br>  For me to be able to come up with anything better I would have had to physically be there.  Turning your back, or turning at least in another direction might have done something (then again, it might have done nothing), also your voice could have had some effect (but without being there I have no way to really know) sometimes in attempt to sound happy and calm we give off "freaked out" vibes without even realizing it.  It also might have made a difference if you took a different route entirely: standing up to the dog.  (which I would never actually recommend to anybody, especially without being there)  <br>  It's possible the dog would have backed down if he had been challenged and told the equivalent of "sit down and shut up, I'm the boss here" in body language.  Of course, that takes major conviction on the part of the person trying to pull it off, and also is extremely risky and stupid in most cases.  :o)  Not something I would suggest trying since you're going to find out the hard way if it doesn't work. (especially with a dog you don't know)  <br>  <br>  Even something as simple as removing the other dog might make an impact on his behavior...who knows.  <br>  <br>  Your boss needs to take action with this situation, somebody could get seriously hurt if it doesn't get resolved.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	You did pretty much what you could do. You could have just stood dead still and not talking, not bending down also.|`|D1beU6MPaa	The first thing you need to do is talk to the owner about this situation. Explain exactly what happened. She is obviously aware that the dog is not accepting to strangers. Not only did it obviously scare you to death, but if the dog had bitten you, you could sue her. And it would have had to be reported to the police, leaving her in a position that she could lose the dog as well as facing legal action. <br>  <br>  You did the right thing for the situation you were in, but you should not have been in that situation. In other words, your boss obviously knows the temperament of this dog and should have never left you alone with it. You really were left in a terrible situation that should never have happened. Good luck|`|n4pNNcGfaa	Calming signals can be a life saver in such an unexpected situation.  While not making eye contact is critical, there are other things you might try if this happens again.<br>  <br>  1.  Stop what you are doing and make no noise.<br>  2.  Turn slowly sideways.<br>  3.  Look at the ground and blink repeatedly.<br>  4.  Lick your lips.<br>  5.  Yawn.<br>  <br>  If the dog charges, hit the ground face down, knees tucked, and arms locked around your head and neck.<br>  <br>  Calming signals are visual cues dogs give to each other to diffuse emotional situations.  Dogs may give calming signals to calm themselves, or to calm the other dog.  In any case they say clearly that you are not looking for a conflict but in a way that is clear to dogs.<br>  <br>  For more information on calming signals, look up the book and video by that name by author Turid Rugaas.|`|p7swtBYzaa	If you are there to clean up dog poop, not get mauled by the dogs, you need to get this dingbat to secure her dogs somewhere else so you can do what you are hired to do.<br>  <br>  Why would you take a chance with aggressive dogs - and why the heck would this person not have the brains to keep her dog away from you?   Don;t go back until she agrees to - it is not your job to deal with her dogs or go through all these machinations when one threatens you.   This is irresponsible in the extreme on the part of the person who hired you.|`|JtYNXoRdaa	You mean your boss left you in the company of that dog AFTER what you described to us???  WTH?

When you saw the 2nd dog acting in this manner you should have stopped what you were doing and informed her.  <br>  <br>  Making friends with a fearful aggressive dog on it's turf is not a good idea at all.  The fact they didn't know you should not come into play if  it had a sound temperament to being with. <br>  Fear based aggression is not something to fool around with especially when the dog doesn't settle down to allow you to do your job!<br>  <br>  JMO|`|b0lmWhmMaa	were you sitting down or standing up when trying to give attention to the second dog?<br>  <br>  if you were sitting, you should have immediatly stood up. you must be taller than the dog, otherwise he thinks he can dominate you. you have to show your dominance to the dog.<br>  <br>  what should've happened if the other dog was wary of strangers was you let it come to you when it finally felt comfortable and ready. given with some dogs, that might take several meetings before that can happen. it has to be on their time, you can't force a dog to like you.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	Shame on your boss! Imagine if it was some kid who was hired to clean the dog poop, that is a disaster waiting to happen. From what I can tell, you did everything absolutely right. The dog is challenging you, dominant dogs will do this when there is no owner (pack leader) to control the dog. It doesn't sound like a fear aggressive dog at all, a fearful dog will attack/bite you from behind.  A dominant dog is more subtle, using body positions and attitude to assert their dominance. And you never pick fights with a dominant dog, especially if it's not yours. <br>  <br>  Being aloof is a must and NEVER assume the dog is "friendly" because it allows you to pet it. People always make this assumption but in fact, a dominant dog will demand to be petted to assert dominance. <br>  <br>  Tell the owner that this dog needs to be crated when he can't supervise the dog. He might seem skeptical at first though since the dog is probably only aggressive when he's not around but be firm. You did everything right, but who knows what the next person might do.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	It's nothing you should have done, it's a case of what the owner had a *responsibility* to do and seemingly failed to do.<br>  <br>  I had a very territorial dominant male Dobermann, which is standard for the breed. He would bark when someone approached the house & stand by my leg rumbling in the back of his throat when I opened the door *but* when I *allowed* the person in, he *immediately* back down on command.<br>  <br>  Your boss should have either signalled to the dog that you were allowed in the house or if the dog hadn't been trained to stand down on command, put the dog in a crate/locked it another room. <br>  <br>  As the owner of the dogs, it was the responsibility of your boss to control or contain the dogs, to ensure that you could go about your business without being put it fear of conflict. <br>  <br>  I have just purchased a big thick walking stick to use if a dog is threatening to attack.

I'm not saying you have to put the dog to sleep, but you could (I don't think that's the answer though). You can turn it in to a local shelter or dog rescue.

Try giving him something different.  AND PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO LISTEN TO SHAY.  SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT AND HAS GIVEN VERY BAD ADVICE ABOUT BETTA'S BEFORE, SUCH AS PUTTING THEM IN WITH FEMALES, WHICH IS WRONG BECAUSE THEY WILL KILL EACH OTHER.  A BOWL IS NO PLACE FOR ANY FISH, AND BETTAS DON'T PREFER SMALL SPACES.  THEY CAN HANDLE THEM, BUT DON'T PREFER THEM.  BIG DIFFERENCE SHAY.  THEY SHOULD BE KEPT IN A FILTERED, HEATED AQUARIUM OF AT LEAST 3 GALLONS, NOT A BOWL!!!!<br>  <br>  Here's some info on Betta's from liveaquaria.com:<br>  <br>  "Betta splendens is often referred to as Fighting Fish or "Siamese" Fighting Fish, since it has been bred over the years to be both colorful and combative, especially towards other males. As such, only one male Betta should be kept in an aquarium. However, smaller, shorter-finned - though often equally as colorful - females may be housed together with caution. The Betta should be housed with peaceful fish that will not nip at the Betta's glorious, flowing fins. <br>  <br>  An ideal environment for the Betta is a well-filtered aquarium that holds a steady temperature of between 75° and 86°F. Though the Betta is often sold in small bowls in department stores, for best care, Betta splendens should be kept singly in aquariums of at least 3 gallons. It also prefers a variety of hiding places amongst the foliage of freshwater plants. <br>  <br>  The Betta can be bred in the home aquarium. For breeding purposes, males and females can be temporarily housed together. Once laid by the female, the eggs are placed inside a bubblenest and tended by the male Betta. Fry appear in about 24 hours and must be fed very small food initially, such as crushed or powdered flakes and newly hatched brine shrimp. Fry will also take finely chopped hard-boiled egg yolk. <br>  <br>  Provide the Betta with a carnivore diet consisting of a quality flake food, frozen or freeze dried bloodworms and brine shrimp.

How often do you do your partial water changes (complete water change should never be done)? What are the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels?<br>  <br>  Sorry, but without this info it is hard to say what is wrong. If this has been going on this long, it may be too late.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Sounds like dirty water to me, and for sure, it isn't warm enough. What size tank is he in? Is it filtered? He'd do better in warmer water, around 76-78 degrees. I'd do regular partial water changes, and maybe treat him with Maracyn-two. It's for sick fishies that won't eat.<br>   Try shelling a pea, cutting it up into tiny pieces and offer him a few of the pieces. Bettas usually love peas. You can also try tempting him with bloodworms or brine shrimp.<br>  This would be my game plan for a sick Betta, hope it helps!|`|1gXo8oHtaa	I had that same problem and I keep mine in a bowl because betta fish don't like a lot of space that could be one reason. Another reason is as simple as you need to clean the bowl or tank out even if you have a filter which could be another problem if you have a filter. Also it could be bored with the food I buy mine ''BettaMin Tropical Medley'' Wardley Essentials Betta Food'' and''Tetra BloodWorms Freeze Dried Food'' my betta fish will be 2 in July. Good Luck<br>  -Shay|`|OjsaQRGfaa	let it die. Its its own stupid fault for not eating. it deserves it. :)|`|SXfFI05Gaa	How's it still alive...?<br>  Try boiling water, cooling it to a luke-warm temperature, put him in there with the treatment, let the treatment sit for a half hour, and try feeding him one pellet.
Idunjsxjaa	Besides pellets you need to feed your rabbit Timothy Hay.  They get enough alfalfa from their pellets.  <br>  <br>  I am not an expert but before getting my rabbit I did a lot of research and reading.  I am a firm believer in keeping a rabbit indoors....these are DOMESTIC rabbits!  "Out of sight, out of mind"  rabbits left outdoors tend to be forgotten or don't recieve the attention needed (just my opinion).  But if you have no other choice but to keep it outdoors you need to remember some things:  The hutch must be secure to keep your rabbit safe from predators.  If the weather is cold it needs to be shielded from the elements and provided with enough hay to keep warm.  If it's warm, again, it needs to be shielded from the elements.  And always always no matter the weather conditions, provided fresh water.  <br>  <br>  Sneezing and shaking....I think that is best handled by a vet.  <br>  <br>  Remember pine and cedar bedding are NOT good for your rabbit.|`|UMfumO1paa	Well he also needs alfalfa hay. This helps him digest better especially since he can get bound up from all of the fur that he ingests. And as cold as it is outside he should really be inside but if your hutch has him sheilded from the elements and he has a nest inside to keep him warm he should be ok.|`|q0rLBQo2aa	Where do you live / how cold does it get / was he raised indoors before you got him? Shaking is more likely fear than cold. Sneezing could be dust irritation. His lungs would fill up and he'd wheeze or cough if it's a cold.<br>  <br>  Pets deserve more commitment and better care than such a vague question and such inexpert answers as you will get on this site. Even someone knowledgeable will not be able to help much if diagnosing from a description. Internet-search by “[pet species] Caresheet” and/or go to kingsnake.com The site is for reptiles, but along the side of the homepage they have links to other pet sites, where you will get genuinely expert advice.<br>     Animals are not toys. Pets have no *right* to humane treatment because they are not human. BUT we have an obligation not to be cruel or neglectful, because as human beings we know better and have a moral duty to act in accordance with that knowledge. That's why it's called "humane" treatment. If you're not humane, you're not fully human.
2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	Small dogs have a common problem called "collapsing trachea" the only thing you can do is talk to a vet and make sure it's not bordetella (kennal cough) Are you using a collar or harness? for small breeds, my vet prefers a harness, because it won't sit on the neck, If you don't take your dog to a public place, some vets won't vaccinate for kennal cough, and they will leave that up to you, however A lot of germs are spread from standing water ( someone elses dogs drink from a puddle after the rain, and then your dog drinks from the same puddle) good luck.

wLgGD63raa	Uromastyx are strictly herbivores, and they look pretty sweet in my opinion. They vary in size depending on the species you get.<br>  <br>  Ornates tend to stay pretty small and can be any number of colors, bright blue, green, yellow, red, but are fairly expensive.<br>  <br>  Mali's are black and green as males, and more earthy tones as females. They usually average out at about a foot long, but sometimes can get bigger. They are extremely hardy probably one of the most available species of these animals in the pet trade. This is probably the one you would want if you are a beginner with these lizards.<br>  <br>  Egyptians are the biggest in these species, sometimes getting over two feet.<br>  <br>  There's a couple other different types such as a Sudanese, and Saharan species of this animal.<br>  <br>  No matter what animal you decide to get you should read up on them to be sure that you are capable of caring for them.<br>  <br>  You can find all the information that you need on Uromastyx at DeerFernFarms.com. If you just so happen to decide that a Uromastyx is the route you want to go you could even order from Douglas Dix of <a href="http://www.DeerFernFarms.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DeerFernFarms.com</a> I have heard nothing but good reviews about him.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Pretty much the only herbivorous lizard that is available as a pet is the common green iguana.<br>  You'll need to feed him a good variety of fruits, veggies, and edible leaves.  Chop 'em up for him.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	I just wanted to add a couple of things about Uromastyx. They need a basking temperature of 120-130 degrees. They like it hot! Uromastyx are very docile and it seems they like to be handled. Some say that they do need insects once in awhile. Most say they don't. Mine will not eat if there is an insect present, I only feed her plant material. They are very active! They need a 40 gallon tank minimum. I have other lizards, but the Uromastyx is the friendliest and most interesting one I have seen!|`|JzDIux0daa	turtles are said to be omnivores but my slider eats nothing but reptomin turtle pellets..  even land turtles have pellets.. u can find pellets for most reptiles now.. we can tell u what kind are herbavores, but find a few reptiles you really like and go from there.. see which ones you like and then ask if their herbavores

yeSeoIbjaa	Relax girl, stay with her, she needs you to talk calmly, lovingly, in that midwife voice all women have locked inside.  Take a moment for you to breathe deep and slow, you got nothing to worry about, nature generally manages on her own.  She just needs you there.  Enjoy the magic and know that you will know, when it is time to lend a gentle hand. If she is small and has hours of difficulty, she will be running out of strength, and most probably on her side. In the event that you think she's going to give up, gently apply a small amount of pressure to first the top of her abdomen, then the middle and you may find it unnecessary to follow with the lower, as this method quickly stimulates the birth of babies or any after goo.  Again you must relax.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	Some female cats are like that. I had a cat that was the same way. She's very uncomfortable and scared right now. Just let her be near you and try to calm her down.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you have a birthing box for her? That would be a good idea to set one up real soon.<br>  <br>  Just take an old cardboard box and put some old towels or blankets in it. Make sure she can get in and out of the box with no problems. The box has to be big enough for her to lay down comfortably. <br>  <br>  When I would set a birthing box up for my females I always put it in a closet. They like quiet and dark, a place where they won't be disturbed. Leave the closet door open a few inches so momma can get out to eat, drink and go potty. <br>  <br>  Nature is awesome and she knows when it will be time to start having her babies. Just reassure her that she will be fine.<br>  <br>  It's amazing to watch to a cat give birth. I did a few times and the instincts that they have are incredible. And to think it all comes naturally is even more amazing to me.<br>  <br>  I hope she has a safe delivery!  Good luck!|`|rtXdsNY8aa	if you cat is in labor and she has had problems with labor in the past you should stay with her not the whole time but check on her every half hour or so.if you can put her somewhere you can see her and she can see you.like a create or somethng. it sounds like she really looks to you for comfort and right now she needs you.i hope every thing goes well.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Since she had problems before, you should take her to your vet's so she can be properly cared for during and after her delivery.

She has to stick her big nose into EVERYTHING. She is more nosey that any cat I've Ever had. Even worse, she eats anything she sees. So far she's swallowed a tack, a penny, one of those plastic things that you put a screw in before you put it in the wall, I don't have a clue what else. She's an outside dog and she brings things up to our back porch that I have absolutely no clue where they come from! She's brought up curtain rods, a tub of Turtle Wax, part of a broken plate, some Christmas lights...I could go on. Haha...we never know what to expect when we open the back door anymore!|`|cpxkROqMaa	Yes, dogs can be into trouble for being too nosy.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	She does not respect you or your space.<br>  <br>  You need to look at the kitchen for instance and pick a line whether its where the kitchen floors meets carpet or a wall separates the kitchen from the living/dining area. And make that her line not to cross. She does not need to be nosy and be in your business. <br>  <br>  If you need to when you are training her stand in front of her and tell her "Out" or "Go" walk towards her backing her up until she is at that line you don't want her to cross at. When she is there you tell her "stay and good girl!" Walk away from her and if she crosses that line again you repeat the steps. <br>  <br>  You must be stern, when your training do not baby talk. Baby talk shows that your inferior. Its easy to baby talk though because they are so cute. Being stern and louder with her (lower pitch rather than baby talk) will show more dominance over her. <br>  <br>  Also another thing you can do if you want is to teach her to sit at the invisible line or even lay down and then give her the command stay. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SXfFI05Gaa	I find that the Doberman breed is very nosey.<br>  No, curiosity won't kill the dog, but may harm him.

fMRcX2WDaa	well the chew thing is easy to fix keep anything out of her reach and make sure she has plenty of chew toys and bones to chew. on make a toy box and alternate her toys so she thinks shes getting a new toy every day. when she chews on something shes not suppose to stay no loud and stern. than give her something she can chew on.<br>  <br>   now potty training is hard and takes a lot of time you can get a crate and crate train her. that is the quickest and easiest way. get her a crate big enough for her to turn around in and lay in put some newspaper or a crate liner on the bottom. That is where she will sleep eat and get time outs. keep her in there whenever you dont have time to watch her and when you are sleeping at night. take her outside on a leash for 10 min walk her around the area you want her to learn to eliminate. if she doesn't do anything after 10 min bring her back in and put her in the crate for 30 min. than 10 min out side make sure you praise her and give her a treat outside when she dose her thing. now if she gos outside you can give her 10 min free time to play in the house. if she has another accident take away the free time. give 10 min for a good job take away 10 min for a bad job good luck. also make sure you clean any accidents with a enzyme based carpet cleaner if the puppy can still smell the mess she'll think its OK to pee there. never hit a puppy or stick its nose in it or punish her for an accident unless you catch her in the act that stuff will only teach her to hide from you when she needs to go. another good thing you can do is sighn her up for puppy training at pet smart its only 109.00. good luck and have fun with your new family member|`|GSf09ALBaa	Patience.

Most people need to have the 'puppy time' put in perspective and this is the only way I know how to do it.<br>  <br>  Also, if she has not been vetted she needs shots and deworming.

If you LEAVE her outdoors she will pee/poo when she changes where she is (comes inside).. if you tether her she will AVOID going as she will be concerned that she will end up sitting by it.<br>  <br>  With both the chewing and the pottying it seems your issue is that you've forgotten the rule that you must WATCH the puppy at all times when it is not crated/confined.|`|KuUx34hCaa	you need to be consistent & when you take her out use a word like go potty and take her out with in a few second of waking up & take her out often spend time with her while she goes she might be inscure out by her self  my dog liked apple bitter I've used vinegar|`|h4TxVSp3aa	The miracle dog training device is a Training Collar|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	Try Fooey instead of bitter apple, you can also try no-go, it's a house breaking aid. Fooey is much stronger than bitter apple, bitter apple works better if the dog is chewing on itself. You may also want to invest in a crate, while crate training, you only want the dog to be able to stand up lay down and turnaround, do not give them food or water in the crate, and (a lot of people make this mistake) Do not put a puppy pad in the crate with the dog, because the "wee wee pads" are treated with a scent to make the dog want to go to the bathroom, all that will do is trick the dog, think about it we don't want to smell dog mess, but neither do they.|`|URqUGrTnaa	Most of these answers sound great so i wont beat a a dead horse but you might want to try to shampoo you carpets but use "simple Solution"(its a stain an odor remover) inside the machine, it works great(well better then the others) they sell it at petsmart.<br>  <br>  i was having the same problem with are puppy a few months ago. someone mentioned this to me that maybe your dog is trying to mark over old stains they smell in the carpet. maybe its worth a try plus at least your carpets wont smell like pee anymore<br>  <br>  but besides that just be consistent!!! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|SXfFI05Gaa	Okay. Puppies are fun to deal with.<br>  News Paper. Put the smell of pee on the paper and put it near the door.<br>  When she pees anywhere else, put her nose to it, and smack her nose and say "NO!", and then put her in a discipline spot.<br>  Try putting her outside, and when she goes to the bathroom outside, reward her BIG TIME, they love being rewarded.<br>  Try freezing beef or chicken broth in small ice-cube trays and give them to her to chew on because it'll ease the itching (their gums are itchy when they're teething).<br>  Get chew toys!|`|7lLywaDYaa	A lot of good suggestions here, the only one I don't agree with is smacking a dog on the nose and rubbing it in anything.  If you don't catch you pup in the act she will have no clue what you are upset about.  As a suggestion when disciplining take a finger and tap her under the chin.  This will catch her attention.  There is no need to ever hit an animal.  Any time a dog is chewing/biting something, gently but firmly wrap your hand around her snout & mouth and directly say "no bite".  Let her know somethings (toys) are okay to chew, but not others.  good luck|`|O6SXFnRaaa	You need to crate train her. you will have to break her habit of going in the house. that means you will have to be firm,let her out to go to the bathroom and when you are with her, only. chewing may be because she is teething or bored.get her lots of chew toys and try wetting and freezing a rag for her to chew on,it will soothe her gums.|`|gBIrmaOXaa	Hiya there certain times when a puppy will def need to pee 1 - when they have eaten and 2 as soon as they wake up. Watch her carefully as soon as she has finished eating or wakes up put her outside she will pee even if you stand there for an hr you should be out there with her so when she does she gets ALOT of praise the timing need to be perfect as shes weeing a high pitched good girl and as soon as she finished a tit bit. Ignore the pee's in no shouting just complete ignorance its usually very easy to house train but shes now a little older but perseverance will pay off.<br>  Also dogs do not like peeing in their own bed, try a cage for when your out and in bed this should help with the peeing and chewing. DONOT use the cage all the time they a good if used properly and never as punishment. Hope this helps
D178335Paa	They hang on. Get some blue dawn dish soap. It's proven that blue dawn dish soap kills fleas. I used it on my boxer puppy because when I got him he had sand fleas and he wasn't old enough to get flea medication and when he was it didn't work.|`|VMY7No0eaa	fleee or flea? <br>  they can hang on...w/  scuba gear!|`|MFZr5yhAaa	some may come off but most will stay on and re-infest your dog. get a flea shampoo or as another said dawn dish soap works.
Px2oH1ekaa	Hi, I know exacty how you feel!! My dog Kenny does the same thing.  That is why I have to keep him in a crate sometimes, unfortunately I live in an apartment so I don't have a backyard to let him run free while I'm at work.  I think a pet sitter might do the trick! Your dog might have a fast metabolism and needs to poop quite often. So when you are not home the pet sitter can come and walk your dog between 7:40 am and 12:45 pm.  Encourage your dog for pooping outside by giving him a small treat everytime he poops and pees outside and praise him when he does. Sometimes keeping them in a crate is not such a bad idea, but this should not be for long periods of time. You can put his food bowls in there and sometimes dogs learn not to poop in their crate since they do not like to poop around their feeding stations. Also, talk about this with your doggy's vet so he or she can rule out any intestinal parasites or digestive problems that may be causing your doggy to poop often. I hope you find  a solution!!|`|TcJVVurzaa	You should let him out in the backyard during the day so he's not cooped up in the house all day and has a bit of... FREEDOM!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	If he has to go, he has to go, and where else can he do his business if he is locked up in the house? Put in a doggy door and teach him to go out by himself.
zzzd9tC4aa	I'm studying to kill a mockingbird too. Basically, the town of Maycomb can be split into 2 groups: the insiders and the outsiders.<br>  <br>  The insiders are people like Aunt Alexandra, the Missionary ladies-the ones the hold meetings and gossip.<br>  <br>  The outsiders are the Ewells, the negroes, Atticus, The Radleys. A good point to say in your essay/ question is that Maycomb don't like change. This is why when Atticus upsets the status quo between whites and blacks, the town start to hate him.  Heres a few quotes "It's the fact that Atticus aims to defend him, that's what I don't like about it". Usually white lawyers don't put any effort into saving blacks, but Atticus really tries to help Tom. "He's just misguided". Mrs Merriweather says this about Atticus because they think he is doing wrong.<br>  <br>  so basically Maycomb are split into 2 classes, and anyone who is different is considered below and are outsiders. there is a quote: "Maycomb has nothing to fear but fear itself".<br>  <br>  Another class is the Cunningham's. When walter comes over to scout's house for supper, he eats really rudely and scout thinks he's stupid. calpurnia says " don't let me catch you remarkin' on their ways like you was so high and mighty". Scout learns to respect others ways.<br>  <br>  hope this helps. But above all you should REALLY read the book- it gets better from the beginning.|`|a063525afac8cd769f0358cd6b18ff02aa	Quit asking these questions and just read the damn book yourself LAZY!

It might be that as it's her first season, it's just a wee bit unpredictable.|`|bghHMy22aa	check and see if her women part is swollen if that is then she in season|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	Male dogs only mate with female dogs when the female is in season - unless it is an act of dominance. For the first week of a season there is usually no blood so your female may well have been in the early stages of her first heat when she mated, and now may be pregnant.<br>  Sorry if I have misinterpreted your info, the best option IMO is to take her to the vet. Please spay your dog.|`|2eJcaeOPaa	if her foofoo is swollen and there is blood drops around the house i would say she's in season. dogs are in season for a few weeks but if your worried i'd take her to the vet <br>  pms may have caused the incident|`|0hHw5IK7aa	My dogs season last three weeks so it may well be her season, but if you're worried I would take her to a vet to be checked out - if it is something else you dont want to leave it too late.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	When you take her in to get spayed your vet will be able to tell you if she is permanently injured.|`|H3giw4QHaa	If she is eating and drinking normally I wouldn't be too concerned.

91CX5jHaaa	I assume you are asking how to be a responsible breeder. :-)    1. Contact a breed club for your breed. Ask for a mentor.  2. STUDY the breed standard. Learn about dog anatomy and ask your mentor to  clarify anything you don't understand.  3. Learn what genetic faults and diseases run in your breed and test for any  that can be tested for.  4. Show your dog in conformation events to see if it is of the proper  quality for breeding. Winning doesn't always mean a dog is breeding quality,  but being around so many others that know your breed and will talk to you  will do wonders for your self-education efforts!  5. Study the past history of great dogs in your breed. You will see how your  breed has improved and progressed since the beginning of the breed.  6. Study the breed standard some more! ;-)  7. Join any Yahoo groups about your breed.  8. Live, dream and study your breed.  9. Get a good book on canine reproduction, and educate yourself about the  pitfalls, problems, and proud moments of breeding. Learn about the  physiology of reproduction, such as heat cycles and venereal diseases in  dogs, potential for problems specific to your breed, and what you need to  expect at whelping.  10. Remember that whelping (giving birth) can kill your female. Being used  as a stud dog can encourage bad behaviors common in intact males such as  territorial marking, aggression, and desire to roam from home.  11. Prepare to be broke. Breeding properly is EXPENSIVE.  12. Line up potential homes for any puppies you produce and write up a  contract. Remember to include that you will be willing to take back your  puppies at any time in their lives that they might need you. If you bring  life into this world, it is your responsibility FOREVER.  13. Prepare to spend sleepless nights attending whelping females, caring for  fading puppies or puppies orphaned, and practice cleaning up after 24/7 poop  machines.    I'm sure there are many things I missed because being a responsible breeder  isn't just a job. It's a way of life. You will live dogs. 24/7/365. There  are lots of hard decisions. There is a lot of expense. There will be pain.  But, if you do your darndest to always keep the welfare of your dogs and the  future of any of their offspring, you can go to step 14.    14. Enjoy the love and success of a job well done.|`|o93EwErKaa	At 6 years old, especially for a large dog, reputable breeders consider her retired.    As far as absorbing the pups, depending on the cause it may or may not happen again.  It could be that she has a condition called brucellosis (std) which will cause her to absorb every litter. The spontaneous abortion usually happens later in pregnancy, but can occur earlier.  This can be tested for.  Since it is a possibility, I would encourage you to test the female prior to breeding because it will be passed on to the male (rendering him sterile) and then passed on to other dogs.  Really all dogs prior to breeding should be tested for this no matter what the background.    http://www.marvistavet.com/html/brucello...    Spontaneous abortion and/or resorption occurs. The frequency is unknown, as no reliable tests are available to detect pregnancies early. The resorption or abortion of fetuses may be due to a number of causes including fetal defects incompatible with life, abnormalities in or damage to the uterus, ovarian failure to maintain progesterone levels, infections, trauma, too strenuous of exercise or malnourishment.|`|PM23RDycaa	Advice - Get your female fixed. After the first time she should have been fixed. At 6 years of age she is too old to be bred. Pup absorption is one of the MANY risks that comes with breeding.    ADD: And Jen T to the rescue with the good breeder to do list. If you haven't done any of that by now by the time you do she will really be too old to breed. If you want another staffie just go and adopt one or buy from a reputable breeder.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I'd say she's too old for a first litter.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Six years old is pushing it - most breeders (responsible ones at any rate) stop breeding at around the five year mark depending on how often a b*tch had been bred previously. Some go on to breed at seven or eight (again depending on the b*tch, her health, how often she was bred, etc - most breeders who do this are breeding the male at any rate, not the b*tch) but that's very rare as pregnancy and whelping can put a strain on the b*tch's already old body.    Unless your dog is an AKC registered Ch. with prime bloodlines (IE perfect example of her breed as chosen by impartial judges via showing) and an excellent disposition (as determined by behavioral testing such as Canine Good Citizen Tests) i would not breed her. There are thousands of bully breeds in shelters that are put to death, and many more on the way what with the BSL being passed in certain areas.    And with the economy being the way it is, forget selling the pups for any sort of profit. Loads of people will not be splurging on a dog at this point in time. At least, not the good ones!    Spay her now and let her live the rest of her life in peace.|`|AA11097657	Because she never actually whelped at the age of 4 then the age of 6 is too old for a litter.    Had she gave birth to puppies then that would be a different matter.  Her pelvic bones are set and if you had a litter now she would almost certainly need a cesarean.    Costly and a risk to both mother and litter.|`|LEzaJasFaa	the kennel club will not register pups whos mother is 6 and over|`|Mcf33eLbaa	It does not necessarily mean that it will happen again.  I had a girl that did the same thing and delivered 8 pups the next time around.  Good Luck and God Bless    ****** for those of you that jumped on the thumbs down band wagon and just want to advocate spaying this dog .  Did this person ever say she was a backyard breeder?  Did this person ever say she did not show or title her dog?  As well she never said whether the dog was AKC registered or not.   Maybe I`m wrong for assuming that all this is true but I will not jump on anyone that just asks a simple question without giving the details a lot of you want to hear, it`s just rude!  Their are lot`s of breeds that do well being bred at this age even if they don`t meet your personal standards.  I have friends that breed some of the top Aussies in this country and are not afraid of breeding at that age.  So know what your saying before passing your personal judgment on anyone.  If anything you should ask for more information before jumping to conclusions.   I speak from my own experiences, no my girl was not 6 years old, but again some breeds do better than others at that age.  **************************************...|`|AA10972821	This could happen to any dog at any time.  If your dog is 6 years old, you may have to reconsider breeding because that is not very young in a staffordshire terrier.  If you and your vet think she is okay to try to breed again, then the choice is yours but anything can happen any time a dog gets pregnant.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	I think 6 is late for a first litter, but we don't' even breed DDBs after the age of six, so, I may just not know the breed.  The older they are the more difficult it is for the pregnancy to take and to have a successful whelping. Talk to your vet and get his/her opinion first and if all the health clearances and OFA stuff is done, then go ahead and try it.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Of course your dog has had all of her health and genetic testing done?  Of course she has her breed championship?  Of course you have a breed mentor?  O course you have committed homes for all the pups?

Of course you have a contract stating that you'll take back the pups at any time for any reason.  Of course your dog is registered?  Of course you expect to spend many countless, sleepless nites staying up with your dog, waiting for her to whelp?  Of course you realize that you may lose your dog due to whelping/pregnancy problems?    SPAY/NEUTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	if he is pooping blood there could be plenty of reason why this is an emergency case that needs to be seen by a vet NOW.    One is Parvo. if the poop is like water and all blood, that is parvo which can be a very deadly disease.    Another is internal bleeding. if the poop is black, that's a sign there is something wrong internally.    if the poop is normal color, and has traces of bright red blood, there could be a problem with straining and forcing poop out that could be causing tears and bleeding.    There are so many other issues I can discuss that needs to be seen by a vet.    like someone else said... bring a fresh stool sample in a plastic bag. If you can't get a fresh sample, they will be able to get a fecal mass at the vet... though it's not a fun job. so try to get as fresh of a sample as possible.    don't even wait, just go to the vet.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Think of it this way- if you started pooping blood would you want to go to the doctor?

A neutered female cat, that is truly amazing...  That in itself is not normal.|`|YYLybWHSaa	I've generally found toms (neutered) to enjoy the thumping pets more than the smaller females. However when I say thump I mean a thump like I would give a dog, with a cupped hand to their ribs or hindquarters. This makes a noise but is not harsh.   My cats also like to be gently scooted around by pushing them along the slick wood floor while they sprawl on their sides. I place a hand at the tail base and slide them or spin them gently. If they want to stop they just get up. If the toy is just our of reach they will stretch towards it letting me push them into reach so they can swat it.

ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	You can major in animal nutrition at many agriculture colleges.  Keep in mind that most animal nutritionists are involved in the livestock and research industry.  Veterinary technology coursework involves classes in large and small animal nutrition.  Many pet food companies like Hill's, Purina, and Royal Canin offer home study courses in pet nutrition.  The problem with these courses is that they are also sales pitches for the foods, although a person does get some basic knowledge.  You can also major in animal husbandry, veterinary technology, and the like and get a good basic coursework in animal nutrition.    For grooming, most groomers start out by working for other groomers as bather/brushers.  The grooming facility usually pays bathers/brushers an hourly wage or by the dog (piece work).  Groomers themselves are paid on commission.  The most common is 60/40 (60% to the groomer 40% to the establishment).  However, I've seen some 70/30 arrangements too for groomers that have a lot of experience.  Sometimes you can get a head start by going to a grooming school.  Make sure that you choose your program wisely as there a re a lot of sham programs out there.    Trainers are not required to go to school.  Most good trainers got that way by training a lot of dogs and people.  Many started out volunteering at animal shelters so they could get experience working a large number of dogs with all the baggage that comes with shelter dogs.  Good trainers also read books, attend conferences, and seminars to learn new skills.  Like grooming schools some dog training school are shams too so be careful where you spend your money.    Petco and PetsMart do offer training programs for their employees.  I know that some are good and some are bad but you have to start somewhere.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Hard to beat going to school and getting a degree in animal nutrition.

Always use positive training... don't hit or humiliate-they don't learn anything good from that.   My lab came with the basics, but we've taught him alot just by offering peas, peices of lamb's lung and baby carrots!   Talk to your vet about local trainers...our humane society offers classes reasonable.  Good luck!|`|BWJyLZUYaa	first of all we need to know what the problem is in order to help a lot is to keep him busy play with him create train him treats to train him  also go get some dog books if you cant get him class right away the book will at least cover the basics|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	Is your dog older or a puppy?|`|asX2hxFXaa	Watch "The Dog Whisperer" ... he is one of the most respected from dog owners to dog professionals.

iynxbd9Daa	its a nice saddle and i think it might fit. but you really cant just say if it will fit or not because noone online knows your pony better than you. you could always ask to have a trial of it|`|AA11675726	Unless the horse has a very long back, the saddle will be too long for him.  When you are fitting a saddle you need to get above him - in front- and check to make sure that the saddle fits properly.  If there are spots that the saddle rides on him, he won't be a happy horse.  When you put the saddle on for checking size, do so without a saddle blanket or pad.  That way you can see where the saddle might rub him sore.  Are you a very big person?  A 17" saddle refers to the length between the horn and cantle.  Good luck fitting a saddle to your pony.
C4V11yJLaa	Try Getting him active by putting him in his ball at night for about 20 mins. Do this every night, your hamster will probly get very obese if you don't do this.    Give your Ham a new years resolution!    Try and play more with him, Buy a play-pen and play with him on the floor just to get loads of excersise.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	First - throw out that cage - it has so many problems    Tubes have WAY to narrow of an inside diameter for your hamsters to use safely    It's round - hamsters use CORNERS to help orientate themselves to their surroundings and for important things like the "potty corner" - not surprising they pee in the wheel    Size is way to small for one hamster, let alone two.    10" drop - thats way to far for a dwarf to fall if they loose their footing without risking injury.    Go to walmart and for 12 bucks ish purchase a 105 qt Sterilite latch tote and make a bin cage that is a suitable size for a pair of dwarf hamsters.|`|XrMMH5tZaa	that cage is too small for 2 dwarfs fyi|`|cXK9sY1raa	Are you sure he's overweight and not just larger than his brother? Hamsters do vary in size, and don't tend to eat more than they need, so unless you feed them a lot of treats or fattening foods like peanuts, and he never goes in his wheel or gets any exercise outside the cage, I doubt he's actually overweight.    Some hamsters take longer than others in getting used to climbing ladders and the like - some of mine will still avoid it if they can. I'm sure this is nothing to worry about, he will manage it in time. If you're worried about water, try offering him it a couple of times a day.    Also, that cage is awful. It looks good but it is designed to impress potential owners, not provide a suitable home for dwarf hamsters. Purchase a larger and more appropriate cage and you won't have this problem :-) try freecycle, craigslist, ebay, local listings etc if money is a problem, but your hamsters will thank you for it.|`|UraITaK4aa	I am sorry about your over weight hamster. but i have a solution. Frist vist your local food store and buy some celery, grapes, carrots ect. place them up higher that your hamster can climb. but first cut up your foods for him. You can add peanut butter seeds and nuts. Also you can go to a local pet store and buy a mini bottle and filll it up with water. hold Chubbeh and hold the bottle with the other hand and make sure he drinks it. after that buy a wheel for some exsersize fun!( if you dont have one).|`|RjyNInW6aa	I'm am not trying to be rude but I wish you all the luck in the world. it is hard to get a hamster to do anything. Keep the water bottle in his reach but you could try tempting him up the tube with a treat he likes. Good luck.
9UZIgQvzaa	Aww! I am crying. That brought me to tears! D':     I am a Christian too, and I am glad you will see him again someday. :)    Wow, you should report those owners to the SPCA, I mean they didn't even feed him? What are they monsters!?! Seriously, also blaming you? WHAT?!?!?! (Still crying, but also ANGRY)    I'm really sorry about Tigger. Pokey, I'm glad is safe at a shelter. Honey (my neighborhood cat) is really sweet, she is an Orange Tabby. :) I bet your Honey is just as sweet (even if she really isn't, but I don't know) I really hope she comes, and you get her to a shelter. :)    Just remember all the good times you had with Tigger, and try not to think of the bad things. Remember that you loved him. Don't take the room you have in your heart for him, and fill out with hatred for his owners, or the person who ran over him. Fill it with memories and smiles. :]      I hope you are Ok, I'm really sorry. May he R.I.P. When you go to heaven, I'll be really glad to say that you get to be with Tigger again. :)|`|Z0iJSJyMaa	i know how you feel :(  ive lost MANY cats.    why did pokey go to the shelter???  and how is honey on the loose?|`|SoFeInwKaa	She'll be fine. Everything happens for a reason. Think about the positive, God loves you and he will protect your cat. Don't worry girlie. [:|`|ae2463081bceefeded7bc1d2928595baaa	I'm so sorry. Not fun for kitty, either. Did the neighbor care for Tigger much or not? If he or she was a reasonable cat person, maybe you might feel a little better comisserating with him/her and expressing your sorrow. If this is unworkable, maybe you can donate a little time or some food or something to that shelter you mentioned, on behalf of Tigger. Maybe you alert someone to put up official signage (or put up a few yourself) to get drivers to slow down in the area where Tigger got hit, so another animal does not share Tigger's fate.     I won't let my kitty out. I couldn't handle losing my kitty that way.    Good luck.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	go here    http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&clien...|`|aqY13vWNaa	I think reading this will help. In the beginning, God created man, and man was lonely, so he created the animals. Animals were created to be our friends, and you should also know this, God has a plan for us and God has our future in his hands, but it's up to us to unravel the roll of the rest of our life. In other words, you should learn learn to accept the past and move on. Just one more thing, this is my favorite saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift, that is why it is called present. I know your pain, we had to put my dog to sleep after a failed surgery...
k2IIZkA3aa	Yes, they can.    Certain types of chocolate are more dangerous than other kinds. Dark chocolate is the most dangerous, followed by milk chocolate and then white chocolate.    In addition to the variety of chocolate you have to consider the dog. Some dogs react differently to different foods, and one might be able to tolerate more chocolate than another dog. Also, size has to be taken into consideration. A Mastiff that eats two pounds of chocolate will probably fare better than a Yorkshire Terrier that eats the same amount.|`|6a0cd0391065cc81ea4518dae3754040aa	It's not particularly likely, but chocolate is hard on dogs' digestion and on their hearts in large amounts. They do have to be pretty large amounts, though, in relation to the dog's weight.    Example: A friend of mine has a Bull Mastiff. (VERY big dog. He weighs one hundred and fifteen pounds.) The Mastiff stole and ate an entire box of chocolates- a pound of chocolate in all. They panicked and took him to the vet, who said that at his size, he would've needed to eat three times that to get really sick.     If it's just a little, especially in a larger breed dog, it probably won't hurt. Just keep it limited. Diarrhea may be more likely than death, but that's not fun for anyone- you or the dog.|`|xTAR26Gkaa	It depends on the size of your dog and how much it eats. Regular milk chocolate, it would need to eat A LOT. Baking chocolate is the kind of chocolate that's really bad for dogs. But it's safe to just avoid all chocolate, even if it's just to avoid a little upset stomach.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	yes.    i doubt one candy bar would kill it, but several will.    on one of those emergency vet shows, a full size dog came in, had just eaten 1lb of chocolate. they induced vomiting, and then examined the vomit to make sure none of it had gone into the intestines.  they told the dogs owner if it left the stomach, they would have to provide further treatment because the chocolate would kill the dog.    there is a chemical in the chocolate that dogs cant process.|`|f0297cb57aed06b186ca12e00181c7aeaa	That's a toughie.  My beagle-poo has gotten into the pantry & eaten  our chocolate & has had no digestive problems or any repercussions.  I know it's really not good for them, which is why we had the chocolate where we thought he couldn't get it.|`|wanG4pndaa	No, I love chocolate. My human mom doesn't like chocolate too much. Sometimes she gives me a little bit and I just love it! I heard there are special treats with chocolate formulated only for dogs!|`|AA11555614	They may well. And grapes and raisins, too. Read this: http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/...|`|a4crNiGdaa	well its not likely to but if it eats a whole lot of chocolate it could make a dog very sick and could die|`|rao4C9Yxaa	i asked my vet and he said that it was VERY unlikely|`|jqFS16Rjaa	no they can't|`|RgMHqCRtaa	they can get really sick but if they eat just a little bit it wont effect them.|`|WPBnurY7aa	only if they eat excessive amounts|`|9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	I think they can get really sick.  It has something to do with the sugar thats in the chocolate.  They make Doggy chocolate drops, and its basically human chocolate but without the sugar and I think it has more fat.
a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	if he has begun to spray he will still spray but it won't stink. I have an unneutered male who does not spray and a 4 yr. old male I had fixed about a year ago and he does not spray anymore. I think because both of mine are indoor only, neither of them sprays. does your cat go out that would make him more inclined to spray.fixing a cat does make them fat so you will have to be willing to exercise him and only feed him a certain amount of food no unlimited bowls|`|q7UGQRafaa	Neutering your cat is always a need whatever age he is at. That will help you to not get into cat fights trouble, undesired litter, spraying, etc. However this will not change his already developed habits. My cats Vet told us that this surgery needs to be done during a young stage, this is before they develop their territorial, mating, etc manners. Sometimes there is a trigger that jumps into irrational behavior like new cats in the house for example and it's then when he will start spraying again. In any case, neutering is the only alternative to avoid yourself and your kitty from having more and serious problems.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Because you waited so late he MAY continue spraying..  but you can't tell some don't    get it done and then you will know/ otherwise it will keep your cat calmer.  good luck|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It is possible but thorough cleaning & removing the odor as well you can will help.  Besides helping with the marking, it is much better for him healthwise to be fixed.  If you have done it at 6mo you probably wouldn't have the issue of marking.  Keep that in mind for next time.|`|xTAR26Gkaa	Whether he continues to spray or not only time will tell, but it's definitely a good idea to get him fixed. It may not completely eliminate his need to spray, but it should cut it back a little.|`|5765d15bf5b7da6026f760e75cea316faa	Yes, get him neutered.  He may still feel a need to spray occasionally but it will be greatly reduced after neutering.  He will also not react to females in heat by roaming or fighting and neutering prevents unwanted kittens.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Yes, your cat should get neutered regardless of age. Whether it will stop the spraying, sometimes yes, sometimes no.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	spraying might stop, but it also stops fighting and making unwanted kittens.    also, if an unneutered male smells a female or male in the area he WILL spray. if your cat is neutered now, and smells another cat, he MIGHT NOT spray.    get him neutered.|`|nC8AzSKBaa	Yes, because not neutering/spaying a cat can potentially add to the every growing stray cat population that there are not enough homes for.   And he might still spray, but he might not.  It's better just do get it done.|`|4f43aefcef02d80284ee82d0237dd3a8aa	Sure, its never too late, and I do think it would help with the spraying. The last thing we need is for him to populate the area with kittens no one wants. Unfortunately the shelter is full of them. It is the resposible thing to do.
2kjGc7xvaa	Cycling is the process of creating an "eco system" in your aquarium. As you mentioned, good bacteria needs to colonize in which it takes the ammonia converts it to nitrite. Additional bacteria then converts this nitrite into nitrate which is the least harmful of the three to fish. The nitrate is kept in line by 25% water changes. A tank needs to cycle because any level of ammonia present in the water is lethal to all fish. Some fish (such as Danios) are "tougher" and may withstand slight ammonia levels but most fish will not last until the water chemistry is balanced. Once enough bacteria colonizes it will meet the demand of ammonia present. When additional fish are added ammonia will shortly spike and bacteria will increase.     A Fishless cycle would consist of adding water, then adding dechlorinator and water conditioner, running your filter for around 4 week and adding bacteria starter such as BioZyme or Cycle. Also, while adding bacteria you need to add a source of ammonia for the tank to begin to cycle. This can be achieved by adding fish flakes to decompose. You can also use a handful of gravel from an established aquarium, once in your tank the bacteria will proliferate. If you do not add ammonia to a fishless cycle your bacteria will form clouds in the water and turn your water cloudy and never really cycle.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	You have got the basic concept correct.    Have a read of this page, it seems to explain all the technical aspects and methods of cycling.    http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.ht...    Part of the problem is there are many different ways of getting a tank cycled, so there is no one 'correct' method or schedule to get it started.    Most important is to know that if you set up a new tank and just drop in a full population of fish, you WILL have problems.    Ian|`|QC47rv5daa	"Cycling the tank" means that you are establishing a bacteria bed in your biological filter to remove the toxins that the fish's metabolism creates. There are right and wrong ways to do this, and several things you can do to slow this process (which you don't want to do). There are two steps to cycling, but you don't have to do anything special for either of them. First, your filter will grow a culture of bacteria that digest ammonia and turn it into Nitrite (which is more toxic than the ammonia in hard water or water with a higher pH), then your filter produces bacteria that digest Nitrite and turn it into relatively harmless Nitrate. However, Nitrate will contribute to loss of appetite and stress in your fish, as well as contributing to algae growth, so it is important to do regular small water changes to keep your tank in best condition.     You should cycle your tank with a small number of fish. They should be hearty fish, and something that you will want to have in your tank in the long run. Do not cycle your tank with lots of feeder goldfish. Do not cycle your tank with any goldfish unless you intend to keep goldfish. Unfortunately many pet shops suggest this.    For a tank of small community fish, White Clouds or Zebra Danios are good cycling fish; Cherry Barbs or Tiger Barbs are good for a slightly more aggressive tank; or Pseudotropheus zebra is a good choice for an African Cichlid tank. Your local pet shop should be able to point you toward some hardy fish of the type you are looking to keep. Purchase a small number (the number will depend on the size of your aquarium and type of fish and -to a lesser degree- the type of filter) of these fish and introduce them to your  tank. For a ten to twenty gallon tank, two or three small schooling fish or one small cichlid would be more than sufficient. Let the tank sit for a couple of days, feeding your fish carefully to prevent excess food from decaying and fouling the water. There are several reasons that you do not want to cycle your tank with a large number of fish, here are a few:    Cycling a tank with many fish will produce a lot more waste, which will be stressful to your fish, resulting in higher die-off and greater susceptibility to disease.   Cycling with a large number of fish will increase water problems incurred during the cycling process.   Cycling with a lot of fish can contribute to a foul smell coming from the tank.   Every couple of days, do a 10%-15% water change, and after about a week, take a sample of your water to a fish store to get it tested. Most pet shops will test fresh water for a minimal fee, or even for free! If the store you got the fish from won't, check to see if there is another local store that will. At this point, your water should test with high ammonia and maybe a trace of nitrite. If it isn't, don't worry. Just give the tank time. The cycling process usually takes four to eight weeks.    After about eight weeks, your ammonia and Nitrite levels should be acceptable (about trace levels), and you can add more fish. Do not add more fish until the ammonia and Nitrite levels have both dropped. Remember to add new fish a few at a time to prevent over-stressing the filter. If you add too many at once, your tank will have to cycle again, yet if you add a few at a time, your bacteria growth rate will just increase for a short time, with minimal effect on your fish.
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	Rats are social. they're happiest when sold in pairs.    if you are able to give it a lot of attention, out time, and handle him often... and give him plenty of stimulation, you should be ok if you don't buy him with a partner.    in general, like ferrets, they're happier in pairs. However, they do ok alone if you do as I said above, give them lots of attention and stimulate their minds.    **I don't know why all the thumbs downs. again, they are happier in pairs, I concede to that... however they can do just as well if they are purchased alone, however, like I said they need a lot of attention, a lot of stimulation, a lot of activity and socialization with their humans to be happy without a friend.    As someone who has owned a solitary rat (whose original owner gave the partner away to someone else before handing the other one over to me)    It is not impossible to raise a happy rat who is an "only child" if you take the proper care. However, like I said, they do prefer to be in pairs since they are a social species.    nothing I said wasn't true.|`|c5anDswjaa	Its ok to get a single rat.. Yeah they prefer to have a buddy, but they will do fine if you give them extra attention|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	If you can only get one, don't get it. Get a rodent that is happier when solitary, like a hamster. Imagine if you had no other humans to talk to or socialize with - that's what it's like for a single rat.|`|YqVtOSWwaa	DO NOT get a single rat. If you can only get one pet, a rat, or any othe social animal that cannot live alone, is NOT the right pet for you. Try solitary animals that are alright alone, like hamsters, male mice, or hedgehogs.    Rats are social. They depend on eachother for company, mental stimulation, grooming, napping, playing, and spending 24 hours of every waking day together. Your company to it will not come close to comparing with how much happier it will be with a second rat. It won't die or become depressed, but it will NEVER have the quality of life it should, and it will be your fault for not providing it will everything it needs.    If you are not convinced read these:  http://www.ratz.co.uk/petrat.html (under 'How many rats?')  http://www.petratscanada.com/ratcare.htm (under Socialization)|`|aZoCKGciaa	I've had a few rats and have noticed that they are much happier when they have a friend. I've had to introduce rats before to other rats. Its a delicate process depending on the rat's personality. Females usually accept each other better than males do. But you also have to make sure both rats are healthy to do this. I believe its best to get siblings (of the same sex unless you want babies). If you pay a lot of attention to your rat, it could be okay to only get one, but it would be much happier with a friend. Think of sitting in a cage all the time alone. Most beings would like to have a companion. Plus they are sooo adorable when they have a friend. They run around and play together. Take care of each other and snuggle. How cute is that?  Well, good luck!  :)|`|JhStKzRiaa	If you can only get one rat, don't get a rat at all. Rats are naturally social creatures, it would be cruelty to have a single one if you gave it less than 5 hours of attention and play time out of the cage a day.

W02kTOqmaa	As far as the AKC goes, the breed has always been the Parson Russell Terrier. Fans of the parson russell terrier started the Parson Jack Russell Terrier club in 1914. The name Jack Russell was later thrown around and used to describe any mixed terrier, some of which bore little resemblence to the Parson Jack Russell Terrier.     Even though they are most commonly known as Jack Russell Terriers today, few people realize that their true name is Parson Russell Terrier, and the only name used by AKC. They are also call Parson Jack Russell Terriers    Is is arguable, though. Some clame they are different breeds, the only real difference being height. Parson's are 12-14", jack russells being 10-12", while others claim they are the same breed    It's the same battle as that between the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier|`|W4BvABL6aa	Read a Jack Russell Breeders Book....

I had a rat that used to freak out in it's cage, but when I moved him to a bigger cage the problem stopped.|`|3OI0jLfSaa	At the pet shop it probably ha a bigger cage so it might want a bigger cage  or insted of gettin a bigger cage get then a ball to wonder around it it will give them more freedom to roam around so when you put it back in the cage it wont want any more room and it will be more fit and more tired at night|`|xhpi9u1Haa	Its probaly just because its a new home and its not used to it!!|`|HfnXZ6T5aa	I found with my gerbils a good way to keep them amused was to fill the tank 3/4s full of sawdust, and toss in lots of cardboard boxes/tubes/willow sticks you will still find they will still dig at the walls but it will keep them amused for hour, and they are so much fun to watch. Good luck!|`|BDFTt6soaa	My gerbils do this all the time so yes it is normal.Hez|`|Qsi4wgW3aa	They are probably bored, my gerbils do that all the time. Try to take them out once in a while so they can have some excercise, I let mine run around in the bath tub (without the water in it).
IIGUbf6kaa	This breeder is an excellent breeder  Name: Julie B.   Ferretry: Ground Effects Ferretry   Location: NC   Website: http://www.gfxferret.com/    I do know of a breeder in the Carolinas that breeds angoras but they are a backyard breeder and are WORSE than marshall's. You can read bad things on this breeder on these links:    http://community.livejournal.com/ferreta...  http://forum.ferret.com/tm.asp?m=28881&m...  http://forum.ferret.com/tm.asp?m=21121&m...  http://www.petshub.com/forums/showthread...|`|GTmkQzCgaa	I'm not sure about an Angora, but if you go to a pet shop, they may have ferrets from Marshall's. If they don't have any at PetSmart or the like, ask if they can suggest other places you may be able to find some.|`|Zp5upGraaa	An angora might be hard to fine but I'd suggest to you a licensed breeder or pet shop's possibly.
2AXTmluFaa	Rabbits will eat their young if they feel that they are in danger. My advice would be to interact with the parents and babies minimally until they have stopped weening. Then it would be a good idea to separate the young and possibly sell them if you're not palnning to keep them all.      Btw...rabbits are not rodents. They are lagamorphs =)|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Just leave everybody be. A lot of rodent babies spend the lion's share of their time on their backs kicking away, just like human babies do when they're little.  You're right. You dont wanna touch, period. If you handle them too much, Mom may reject them and they'll starve.  You'll know when they're weaned when their little eyes open for the first time (I think it takes about 8 weeks). Then and only then should they be handled by anybody but Mom.  Sounds like your new family's doing great. Enjoy!!|`|abNU8RQJaa	The boy should be separated. Hopefully the mom had already pulled fur She should know what to do. You can touch them, just not too much. Make sure they're okay and always covered in fur. There eyes wont open for a few weeks.|`|Zp5upGraaa	You should fist separate the adult male rabbits from the females and keep the babies with the females, just keep the hutch with the babies warm as you should know rabbits mate fast and get pregnant fast. You also might want to consider getting a cage/traveling cage for the males in the mean time or get another hutch.
JgC9a8m2aa	"The price kills me!" - Does this mean you don't have a lot of money to care for one or that you don't like the idea of spending that much money on a pet. In either case, a ferret wouldn't be for you. They are expensive to keep and care for and if you don't think you'll have enough to properly care for one or don't want to spend that much on an animal, then please don't get a ferret. I spent $3000 on one ferret in vet bills over a six week period and she ended up dying. To some people, I threw away $3000 and should have just put her down in the beginning and saved myself a lot of money; but for me, she was one of my babies and I was going to do whatever I could, no matter how much it cost, to save her. I failed, but even if I could go back I wouldn't have done it any differently, I still would have dished out all that money for her. I'm not saying that with every ferret out there you're going to be faced with thousands of dollars in vet bills, but it is a possibility and if that doesn't appeal to you, then again, a ferret isn't for you.    Kits, good or bad - They're a lot more hyper and nippier than adults, not sure if you'd consider that good or bad. Kits are fun, but definitely require a bit more patience. For some people, an adult might be better, it really just depends on what you're looking for.    Male or female - Ferrets are one animal that you can't really pick based on sex. They all have a unique personality. Females are smaller and tend to be more hyper and "wild" while males are larger and usually more laid back and mellow. I really can't pick a favorite between the two, there's just something special about all of them. =)    As far as the smell, I don't think they really stink that much. Every animal has an odor, just depends on your nose as to whether or not that odor is good or bad. I like the ferret smell, it's very...natural. Most of the "bad" stink usually comes from the ferret cage, so be sure to keep that clean and you shouldn't have any major problems.    Better than a cat or something - It really depends on you, everyone has their preferences. Of all the pets I've had, ferrets are my favorite so far, but that doesn't mean everyone else will feel the same way. They require a lot more time and interaction from you than a cat would. They're also a lot more dependent on you than a cat.     Are there any ferret shelters in your area? If you can find a shelter or know someone that has ferrets, then I'd spend some time with them to get an idea of what it's like to care for a ferret. You won't know for sure if a ferret is right for you or not until you actually spend time with some, but I don't suggest getting your own ferret until you know for sure it's what you really want. They are very cute critters, but unfortunately there's a lot more to it than that. If you get one and don't enjoy caring for them, then that cuteness wears off rather quickly.|`|GTmkQzCgaa	Do LOTS Of research. It's best to get a pair of ferrets, and they are around $100 each. Cage, and the basic supplies are around $300-check out ferret.com    Don't get them just because they're cute without research|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	One pet isn't better than another; it's just what you like and what you can handle.  Having ferrets is like having ferrets (read: cracked out three-year olds powered by energizer batteries--especially kits).    If the price kills you, *now*, you'll hate the vet-bills (which are a necessary evil).  Really decide if you have the finances (I spent well over $1000 in about a month and a half, and didn't get anything more than antibiotics--not even a diagnosis of what was wrong.  So, just keep that in mind).    Having kits is best for people who have had ferrets before.  I would consider getting an older, bonded pair for your first time owning.  A year or so old is good.  Wait 'til you've seen what they're like before getting kits.  Kits are in a whole other 'range' of ferrenting *g*.    Neither sex is better.  I currently have 2 girls and 1 boy.  I love them ALL!!!  So, don't worry about gender (unless they are unaltered.  Jills are more expensive to spay--and they NEED to be spayed.  Hobs can get aggressive and smelly if not altered, but there is no *health* reason to alter, just personality reasons).    For personalities, I have one kinda squirmy female, 1 cuddly, kissy-face lap-hog female, and 1 cuddly, lover-boy :)  So, it depends on the individual fert. Just go for which ever really grabs you, and you'll be happy.      They are sexually dimorphic: boys can get up to triple the size of a female.  Some say, as a joke, that with males it's easier to ferret-proof since they're bigger and can't squeeze into places that a small female can.  But, at 3 1/2 years, my oldest gal, Pixie, weighs over 2 1/2 pounds and Sian,at 4 months, weighs close to 2 pounds, so they're big girls (though neither is overweight--I always think they look *too* small).  But, Yogi, my male?  Weighs close to 4 pounds (at almost 7 months), so he's no light-weight, either.    I personally think ferrets are worth what little hassle caretaking can be.  But, they ARE NOT for everyone.  There's no shame in it, but you HAVE to find that out *before* you bring one home.  It's not fair to the animal to bring it home, and then return it to a petstore or drop it off at a shelter because you got in over your head.  Continue to do your research.  Decide, *then*.  And continue to do research even after you become a ferrent (should you choose to be owned by them).  There's tons of info to keep up to date on, and a good pet owner knows this :)  Good luck on your decision!|`|yAQbzQsMaa	try looking in the free/swap/giveaway part of your news paper.  sometimes people give there pets away. also, make comprimizes with youself. like, maybe, if i get 1 or 2 then i won't but something i don't really really need thats over $15 in the next month.works for me!  hope this helps.|`|sv7tUUTbaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|djhCah5Maa	I think they are really cute too.  My step-father has one. They just have tons of energy.  They are really a high-maintenance pet.|`|bepZupAfaa	That's really going to depend on you. Can you give up 2-4 hrs each and every day to them? Are you willing to clean the cage weekly and litter pans every day? Can you afford the vet bills?Will you be able to devote a lot of time and patience in training them?Will you be able to afford the food, cage,litter, toys and all that is necessary for their up keep on a regular basis?    If you can answer yes to all of these questions and many more then yes they are worth it.    I have 5 ferrets and the cost is quite a bit in keeping them happy and healthy. But I wouldn't give them up for anything.They are my babies.    It really doesn't matter if you get a male or female as both can be lovable and cuddly.    Kits are like having  the energizer bunny x4. They have a never ending amount of energy. Older ferrets are busy too but not quite as bad as a kit will be.    My ferrets are between the ages of 5yrs and 4months. I forgot what it was like to get a young ferret since 4 out the 5 of them are older. Although my older ferrets still keep me hopping the 4 month old is a lot busier. She never seems to get tired.     It is real important that you get the book Ferrets for Dummies(newest edition).It has a lot of information that you will need to know.    As others have stated even after you decide to get one keep up on the information that is available to you about them. You'll be surprised at what you can still learn     Remember that ferrets are an extremely high maintenance pet.|`|SQn6v57Paa	OKay, I had a ferret and They are cool to hold and play with but the caring for them is crazy! They stink too. They crap so much, it isn't funny...they always eat and drink a lot too haha. But if you really really really want one...then try it out but get one of them first.|`|WoeA75yoaa	Worth the effort? Sounds like you're not willing to do all the work that comes along with them. And trust me, it's a lot of work. On top of that price you'll have vet bills, and they require a lot of attention. They can't just be kept in the cage all day.You would probably do better with a lower maintenance pet.|`|hPVrcnPoaa	When they say adopting a ferret is more like it. It's like getting a little kid.  They are extremely energetic, and need lot's of care.  If you have the time they will love ya to death,they are Very rewarding. Make sure you have someone who is experienced with the little critters for the first couple of month's to smooth the transition.     They are alot smarter than cats and the games can be alot more detaled like find the toy, fetch, trick's and such. don't let them get your key's or you will be looking all over for where your little one hid them.

And where it is warmer.|`|rQlzfHqraa	When the ground freezes food gets scarce and when the snow covers the ground they can not get to food like seeds and grains.

wrUsMG4Jaa	He's resource guarding. The best thing you can do is handle his food and treats constantly. When he growls, remove the item from his possession and redirect his attention to something else.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	If he can't be corrected to the point he'll Leave IT, I'd just avoid giving him bones.  Or if you do, give them in his crate so he doesn't have them when he's out and around the family.  You can easily do that by tethering the bone inside the crate so he can't carry it out.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Stop giving him bones. I had a German Shepard who growled when he had a bone.

If the only other fish in the tank is your other Oscar, that's the culprit.    The 30-gallon tank is too small for both Oscars to establish territories, so the one Oscar is trying to chase the other one out of his territory. The other one can't escape, so it takes a pounding.    In the short term, you might be able to solve this problem by putting a divider in the tank to keep the two fish apart, but in the long term, you will need a bigger tank as your Oscars grow bigger (at least 90 to 100 gallons for two adult Oscars).|`|4hSE7pu1aa	wat other fish do u have in the tank and maybe change the water
bZhIEy1Waa	Hi Emilee, has your cat been spayed? I know its the obvious choice to start with but its important - if she hasn't been 'done' then i'd book her in as soon as possible, it only takes a few mins and she'll be out the same day! If she has been done however you've got a major behavioural problem on your hands and unless it can be dealt with you may have no other choice but to re-home her! Your husband won't want this, neither do you i'm sure, but the choice is not nice - a badly scratched and maybe scarred child??? Seeing as she's always been a bit high tempered perhaps the answer lays in specialist training ( please research this as there's plenty of people out there willing to exploit an animal lover! ) or maybe she just needs medication, probably for life, such as a mild sedative that clams her down to the point that she's able to continue living at home? I'd talk to your vet about it and see what he / she says, you can't continue living with her the way she is - something has to change! Best of luck.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Look for a cat whisper in your area.|`|tcMC1dJ2aa	I would recommend getting Pam Johnson-Bennet's book Starting from Scratch.

I've seen dogs who were perfectly sweet and friendly become aggressive after being neutered. I've also seen neutering make a dog wimpy and sluggish. I don't recommend it.    Also, neutering does not stop humping: I've seen it make dogs hump-crazy.

I am sorry but there is not procedure that goes with out possible negative side effects...so why would there be an exception for this one?  There are people who are responsible owners, that are able to handle their dogs, and cats. My dog is not fixed, I have 3 cats, 2 females, 1 male. The male is fixed so he cannot reproduce with the girls, because I DO NOT want to add to the numbers.  I do feel that there are some people who should get their animals fixed, especially the idiots on here who ask about when they can breed their 2 dogs....for example....I would like to breed my pure breed female chihuahua, with my pure breed male akita, how much can I sell the puppies for?? Then you first try to explain to them that it is not possible, you cannot breed a larger male to a smaller female, the pups will kill her, and then you try to tell them that they are making a mutt, and they comeback with the THEY ARE NOT MUTTS THEY ARE BOTH PURE BREED.  Most of them are to ignorant to even understand that 2 different breeds of dog will make a mix A.K.A a mutt.  I found a website about negative side effects of spay/neuter, let me go find it.    Here it is.  http://saveourdogs.net/health.html    I do not understand why I should have to defend my thoughts on this matter and be critisied, and called ignorant because I have different feeling about spay and neuter.  I feel like I am doing what is best for my dog. I am not, not neutering out of my own selfishness, I do not plan to ever breed my dog, I do not allow him free roam, and he does not have access to bitches. And is always supervised.    Wow nimmy that was not necessary, but I do understand your frustration.|`|2co8VRwMaa	The only VALID reason for not spaying or neutering is if the dog is purebred, a brilliant breed example, is winning in its respective competitions and will only be bred within its breed to make more quality purebreds.  Every other reason is just a rubbish excuse. Dogs don't get that there are so many of them that they should just not breed. To them, and most animals, they have to pass on their genes, and will try to. A dog left intact will most likely either go out and get a female pregnant at some stage or become pregnant by another dog. It's not their fault, it's just what nature is telling them to do, so as responsible owners it is our job to simply make them unable to have puppies.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Because not all pets need to be altered.    Some pet owners are still responsible enough to handle multiple in-tact dogs.     The biggest "reason" for not altering a dog is the physical maturity. If you neuter an animal too early, you risk inhibiting bone and muscle development. You can also cause behavioral problems from neutering too early, and more.     If you can HANDLE an in-tact male or female, and take the proper precautions to prevent litters, then why not? Given, altering an animal can help prevent some cancers and behavioral issues, but so can proper care.    ADD> Lmao, Nimmy ran out of Placebos this morning, didn't she?|`|Re576Xa5aa	Why do i 'have" to anyways. If my dogs live in kennel runs and were bred for work ethic why do I 'have" to! My dogs are genetic certified. Some have done shows and 3 are Ch. I sell them under spay nueter but I respect peoples decisions to not spay, If they can handle it fine by me, but a de sexed dog is better for families. So i guess I agree with you sorta, but i don't go around telling people to desex their dogs. and there are A LOT of responsible breeders out there. But the USA   should seriously do breeder licensing, and so should the AKC.    EDIT: I have desexed dogs and the boys DO NOT STOP MARKING. And can still "breed" just cant make puppies. And dogs that are not BIB, Ch. and winning eukanuba tournament of champions can still be good breed examples.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Ignorance =/|`|xPxm8ONiaa	Money, people also think that it is unnecessary because there dogs never go out of their site, so they can't impregnate another dog, some health reasons too.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	There are no reasons just excuses.  If you are breeding for show purposes & your dogs pass all the perfection tests for the breed then ok.  If you are just keeping the dog for a pet then they will become BYB or the kind of ignorant people who let them out to run around until they get put in a dogs home.  Not fair on the dog & irresponsible of the owners.  I know what I'd like to do to them but I cannot possibly say on here.I have a perfect stunning Pedigree Whippet puppy & she will be spayed in 2 months time.  My old girl has already been done she was the result of over breeding/battery/over raced & lucky to be alive when I got her almost 4 years ago.|`|701FO16zaa	unless you are a registered breeder, I think all dogs should be spayed and neutered. Just produces more pups to be treated badly or neglected and then put to sleep because of irresponsible owners!!   SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR DOGS!!|`|8BuiKlILaa	Me and my family for not neutering our first dog is because we never had that extra money to go out and have it done. But its not like she needed it done either. She was always on a leash and when she escaped the house we would find her soon after giving her no time to fix her. But I do agree fixing you animals is a very big deal to get them fixed. But other than the money factor there is no other "reason" for not fixing there animals.|`|LsduvqHMaa	Maybe they don't want to mutilate their pets? I'm sure I'd be pissed if someone wanted to chop my balls off.    EDIT: Wow, seems I've touched a nerve. Why are you so riled up about this anyway?     "...line uttered by pathetic insecure MEN to their wives in vet waiting..."    "You're only a pathetic insecure MAN if you think the dogs *care* about their balls"    And why do you assume it's only men? I've seen women refuse to get their dogs fixed.|`|kg4aOcKeaa	i think ignorance is the biggest, they just don't think anything will happen if they don't then they come on here and freak out.     others cry poor mouth and say they can't afford it not knowing that there are so many programs out there to help people get lower cost spay and neuters, if only people did some research.     others are just lazy.. a couple i know just never did it and dealt with the heat every 6 or so months and they had no reason not too, they would rather use th money towards their wedding  big screen tv, or expensive sun glasses. they are just lazy and irresponsible
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	To check it, you need a hardness test kit. "kh," or calcium hardness, is also known as "alkalinity" or "buffering capacity."    The easiest way to make water hard and keep the harness from going back down is to use calcareous rocks and gravel in the tank. Examples are limestone, tuffa, coral (crushed coral makes a good substrate), marble, and aragonite. These will very slowly dissolve in water and thus maintain hardness and buffer the pH to about 8.0 or above.|`|qAwnAYGAaa	You can take a sample of it to a petsmart or something and they will test it and give you whatever you need to make it a better place for your fish to live.  Good Luck!
tnTxHVO5aa	If it is a strictly indoor cat, no collar needed.  Indoor/Outdoor, collar for sure.  With out a collar he may be picked up as a stray.  Just make sure it is a "snap away" collar in case he get caught on something    ADD:  I forgot about microchips Duh!|`|MqYfsYd0aa	i'm a big collar fan.  i like the bit of color it adds, and i have an odd sense of security when i hear the bell jingling around.  plus it holds the licence my cat is required to wear!    everyone has their opinions... you're gonna hear alot more why nots on this forum. i say, if you want your cat to wear a collar.  have at it!|`|y7igESfUaa	It's a sensitive subject in your area? That's different, ha.    I see no problem with cats wearing collars. Most of the collars they sell now (if not all at your local pet store) will be breakaways (they'll have some sort of elastic so if they get snagged on something, it'll come off or they may have a clasp that will allow the collar to open).    Just like a dog, if a cat gets lost, someone will be able to check their ID tag (on their collar) and return the cat to you.     If you're looking for an alternative to an ID tag on a collar, you can look into microchipping. The vet will insert a rice-size computer chip into the cat's scruff (his neck). The only problem with this method is if the person who finds the cat doesn't know about microchipping, they won't bring her to a vet and no one will ever know.    Whether you choose collar or not, have fun with your new kitty! :]|`|OVASKZMNaa	My cat wears a break-a-way collar so that if she gets tangled on a branch or something she doesn't hang herself. It's very important to have a safety collar...I've found my cats collar under my neighbor's tree a couple of times due to her being tangled and the collar breaking free from her. Other than that...don't see any reason why they can't wear collars. Mine doesn't seem to mind hers at all; and her little bell lets me know when she's underfoot (and warns the dogs that she's coming around the corner) :)|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Just make sure it fits loose just in case it needs to get it off it's head in an emergency.|`|aqY13vWNaa	No, its not a bad idea, they sell collars for cats, but you will have to put it on loosely, not too loose, but loose. If she itches her neck and is bothered by it, then take it off, collars are not necessary is your cat does not like it.|`|hPVrcnPoaa	yes it's important. put you name and address in case the cat runs away. also you can get a choke-less collar that will pop off in an emergency.|`|WLOYtPA1aa	If you let it loose because they are playful kitty they start biting it and then it will choke them.    If you let it little tight is might be very uncomfortable to wear.  Take a picture that you are wearing a collor, what do you feel like?  It the same way as cat.|`|jJjW9hx7aa	Yes they should wear collers. if they do, you can hear them coming, and then you know if they are going to try to get out, or if you are near the food dish, then you can hear it come and you know it wants food|`|D1FlyZrcaa	collars are fine. you just need to make sure it is a break away collar. not a dog collar. even if it is loose they can still get stuck on stuff and if they cant get unstuck they will freak out and could majorly hurt themselves to the point that they could strangle them selves or break their necks. the shelter that i got my cats from told me that a lady came in one day and was looking for her cat. she got out one day and she hadn't come home. she was wondering if she had turned up at the shelter. she hadn't but they told her that they would keep and eye out for her. several days later the shelter found her cat hanging from her collar in a tree. she had fallen and the collar got stuck on a branch. because it wasn't a special CAT break away collar she couldn't escape.    so please get the break-away one. collars are fine as long as you have the proper one.|`|7vJNHaskaa	I don't think it's a bad idea at all, why can't cats wear collars??    Although my cats don't wear collars because they can't stand them, at all. Good luck with him!! And I love his name btw :D|`|aeUjAvTuaa	Well, putting a collar on a cat is a very smart move. You can never be sure if your cat runs out the door. I think you should put a collar on your cat just in case because your cat chester might run out the door at any time and you want to be sure you find him again.|`|yCR6qg0baa	I don't think indoor cats "need: collars. I think outside cats are disgusting (getting into God knows what & then  climbing all over the kitchen counters-- eww). So pretty much, no, I don't think they need to wear collars.     We got my kitten a collar when she was about 6 weeks old. She didn't grow into it until she was about 7 months old. By then, she didn't want to wear it. We put it on her & she rolled around like she was epileptic or something & had it off her neck in under a minute. We've tried getting her to wear it, she still yanks it off.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	get a collar.

They're happy ( not fighting ) and easy in their surroundings ( wagging tails ) and are delighted to be at home with you! Next time you bump into your neighbours it might be helpful to explain whats going on when your dogs are having a chat ha ha, i'm sure they don't think you're beating them though, you'd have had a visit from the authorities before now.|`|kg4aOcKeaa	i'm guessing they are talking to each other. i really don't know but that sounds really cute!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Communicating with each other. Very endearing.|`|16KUkMP0aa	OMG! :]  That's so cute!  I guess they must be good friends??  Soz idk... but it's adorable!
vZFLG75Zaa	Adam, that is absolutely awful.    I would call your state's game and fish dept. and they will give you the number to your nearest wildlife organization.  It is better to leave wild birds, even a small sparrow, in the hands of experts.  If you dont know how to handle it, its better that you give it to someone who knows.  I worked at an organization who took in sick, abandoned, injured birds ranging from predatory to seed eaters.  I have seen the effects of people handling injured birds in their own home, it's just better to give it to experienced bird handlers.|`|p8UAIAisaa	I would just leave the wound alone, In a couple of days it should close up .  Keep him warm and give him some bird seed and maybe leave a little cup of water. You will notice when he is ready to fly again and then you can release him back into the wild|`|6KxBqnstaa	First thing is to warm him up good. Stop any bleeding from the wound by applying flour or cornstarch to it. Make sure the wing is not drooping. Is the wound from the ice? If so put nothing on it. If think it is from a cat then needs to see a vet that sees injured wildlife or contact a wildlife rehabber in area that can take and care for it as any bird that comes in contact with cat or dog saliva/bitten needs antibiotics asap as they have toxic bacteria in saliva that will cause deadly infection in birds very fast. Warm him up by placing in box or a small cage with a heating pad set on low under the outside bottom of it or even a hot water bottle covered with a towel inside enclosure with him. If the bleeding stopped and he is eating and drinking and can fly and the injury is not from a cat then let him go in a day or two. I would put a breakaway collar on the cat with a bell to warn wildlife that he is around. Offer bird some wild bird seed and shallow dish of water. If not sure how injury happened or wing looks bad I would call vet or rehabber. Both are free for all wildlife. So good of you to help this critter. :)
M9o5WpOqaa	Hairless rats require the same care as the hairy ones.The only exception,because they are bald,they tend to get cold.I know you said you live in Hawaii,but rats are sensitive to air conditioning.At all given times,I have a large piece of polar fleece in my boys cage so they can snuggle up for warmth.He also needs a friend,though you will probably need a larger cage...and a food bowl...and a water bottle...and food...and shavings (NEVER use cedar,pine is not great either-use Carefresh).I bet you didn't realize that your little 'nudist' required so much,huh? Once you have 1 rat,I guarantee you will want another-they are the most awesome pets ever! Good luck.|`|CvRscCrjaa	buy him a coat.|`|XQ5JjMs6aa	Well hairless rats are no different then from regular rats. I hear there better tempered. I have two male rats. The first thing I would recommend is getting him a friend. If you only have one rat they get lonely and can live a very unhappy life. Secondly buy some cereal, and oats for breakfast. Rat food that comes in bags is unhealthy for them. So Cheerios are a good breakfast food. Then for dinner cook rice, noodles, and different kinds of veggies.Also a bigger cage is Ideal.

xowm9t3kaa	probably a guinea pig their less fragile i had one she was a real sweetie but that's just my opinion|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I love my teddy bear hamster, she does more than eat and sleep, not much more, but she's still fun to play with. I also love Guinea Pigs though, they are bigger and make cute noises, I also believe they live longer too but as such require a longer commitment and more space to house properly.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Personally, I have never owned a guinea pig. I have owned several hamsters and the sweetest hamster ever is the Black Bear Hamster. I have had several Black Bears, they are very tame... they have no problem being held and snuggled... I never had one bite me (unlike teddy bears), and they are slightly larger than teddy bears.   Go for a Black Bear hamster!|`|9i72dHxmaa	definetly a teddy bear hamster|`|yAQbzQsMaa	hamster! totally!|`|xc6iCPUQaa	Well I have had both a hamster (Not a teddy bear hamster, just a regular hamster) and a guinea pig. In my opinion here are the pros and cons of both pets.    Hamster:    Pros:  Less clean up  They play more  They are cute  They don't make much noise    Cons:  They don't live very long  They sleep during the day and they are up at night      Guinea Pigs    Pros:  They live pretty long (like 5 - 7 years)  They are active during the day  They are cute    Cons:  They take lots of cleanup   They don't play much  They make a lot of noise, especially if they are hungry  They eat a lot    I think you can make your own decision on which pet you want.|`|BF2spmBgaa	Guinea pigs are the more durable choice. They can spend more time out of their habitat hanging out with you in the living room or walking around the house.|`|UraITaK4aa	I loved my teddy bear hamster the funny thing is she has a small carry around contaner and i watched TV with him and he loved it.

8d21c845ad2788735c20cdfd89e7dd62aa	I know a pug that would sniff out chocolate in the house and eat it...guess his owners were right on the money when they named him Snickers! Anyways, their vet said that dogs should NEVER EVER be given chocolate...but that said, it takes quite a bit to become lethal in a dogs system. A few chocolate chips from the cookies shouldnt harm them. If I recall the vet said that they will start drinking a ton and eating grass if the chocolate is bothering them toa point where they are getting sick. If you see your dogs acting abnormally or eating grass and drinking water I think you should take them in. But my gut (no pun intended) tells me they just had a tasty treat this afternoon.  Best of luck to you!!|`|0fuF2sHbaa	Well, a dog of 60lb could *die* from 140g of regular milk chocolate, do you think there was that much chocolate in the cookies?    If they eat half that amount, there's usually excessive thirst (experience) urinating and discomfort.    Any more and there can be seizures.     If you're worried, act now because in an hour it might be too late. As soon as digestion starts, it could be too late.    Remember, they don't always show signs of poisoning straight away, it could hit them tomorrow.|`|JVvnET59aa	They should be ok, chocolate is only fatal to a dog in lethal doses. Milk chocolate is the least harmful and Coco is the most harmful. Just watch them closley..they'll be fine!!|`|xPxm8ONiaa	They should probably be fine. If you notice anything unusual, like your dog seems restless, panting, vomiting, pupils dilated, take them to the vet. But they should be fine :)|`|DmUG33axaa	only dark chocolates and cocoa are really bad for dogs, but if they are just chocolate chip cookies they should be fine, theres not a whole lot of chocolate in them.|`|qu7DSLTqaa	I think they will be ok, they are good sized dogs and didn't get much. I would Call the vet and ask what to watch for...if they think there will be problems, etc. They won't charge you for the call, but it will make you feel better!
339NqJ84aa	Vaseline + Pure Citronella Oil = great bug repellent.|`|o93EwErKaa	Here is the recipe using Avon's skin so soft oil.

You should give them a good bath and comb them out,as dirty,matted dogs will attract more flies which will lay eggs in the dirty mats and cause maggot infestation,which will kill the dogs as the maggots eat them alive.Make an ointment for their ears by mixing the fly repellant into some Vaseline.Or you can use Vick's Vapo Rub.The best thing would be to let the dogs inside,at least during the day when the flies are the worst.And ask your neighbor to hang flypaper in his horse's paddock and use fly repellant on the horse.Can you move the dogs to the other side of the yard?|`|VONkoiJpaa	Pure citronella oil watered down then spray it on the dogs fur. You can also burn citronella in incense form in your garden to keep the flies at bay. Most bugs hate it, very good for keeping fleas away too. We use it as a repellent regarding bugs and fleas for our cats and staffordshire bull terrier a lot. x

If you are pulling the leash straight back, that will only make a dog want to go forward.  Tug the leash to the side.      If you can walk her with a dog that you know she is normally aggressive towards.  Walking makes them feel not so threatened.      You also might want to get a soft muzzle until you know that your pup won't hurt another dog.    Also, a pinch collar is a helpful tool.  I know a lot of people don't believe in them but if used properly, they are great collars on a dog that can be powerful and hard headed!|`|GSf09ALBaa	I am going to wait for the answers you get because I have the same exact problem with my Pit.  It is embarrassing and she is so strong and sounds vicious!  But she is in a home with 8 other dogs and most of the time there are no problems.  (Except when we get into 'I want that bone thing')    So, I have tried making her sit and stay until she calms down (which she doesn't)  I have tried walking in another direction, jerking on the leash and giving her a firm "leave it" and keep walking while all the time she is going crazy.  I have no idea what the problem is because she KNOWS who is in charge, not in the least human aggressive and she will do a sit stay down and place.  But when it comes to the walks it is so outrageous.  And yes, I stay calm.  My husband, who is Mr. Calm has the same problem.    I will await your answers to help me also!|`|Cx9c6KrVaa	The problem is actually you. You may think you're the pack leader, but I'm afraid your dog thinks otherwise. She decides when the pack is supposed to attack, not you. So I think you need to work on your dominance.|`|yk4S7uuraa	My shepard, Schulz, used to do that too, and grew out of it when he got older.    When he was a pup, he was very hyper. I used to brush him, and that helped calmed him down.

From a top Uk GSD kennels she is, with gorgeous colourings and a top hip score and brill pedigree apparently, but she's BARKING MAD for want of a  better word and yet, she truly adores WORSHIPS my brother and is submissive to him but still cannot go out a  walk , ever.    Needs a muzzle she is highly strung which frustrates him immensely as he loves her to bits and she is gentle at home with him (adult no kids in their household).     God knows what to advise you, as he tried a vet recommended dog behaviourist  at 40 an hour with tricks and training aids but still has not cured her , he will never give up on her as she is such a playful giving dog back to him and he says she has dog phobia and maybe always will have. She is 4 now.|`|n4pNNcGfaa	Pulling on her leash or collar will only make this problem worse.    Yes, she needs more socialization, but at this point it needs to be done under the supervision of an experienced trainer.  Specifically one experienced with German Shepherds.    GSDs are working dogs.  They need two things if they are ever going to fit in to a home:  obedience training and lots of exercise.  The obedience training exercises and disciplines the mind.  Without training they get into bad habits out of boredom, including aggression issues and destruction issues.  Without physical exercise you face the same problem.    This is not something you can safely fix on your own with advice from the internet.  Enroll in a good obedience class immediately.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	It could be time to go to puppy training or obedience classes. Failing that a personal trainer.|`|4biGrjPkaa	More socialisation is the only way i'm afraid. If you are not in a position to socialise her in her own environment you might want to consider taking her to classes. I've got a 2 yr old alsatian ***** and she's the same. we've left it a bit late but she's getting better with age.    Good Luck.|`|kg4aOcKeaa	this is something that you may never fix but can be worked on. Some training schools offer classes that help with dog aggressive dogs( i know mine does) or even signing up for a class just so she is around other dogs will help. Yes she may know all the commands, but getting her to sit/ lay down while other dogs around will be another challenge. Shepherds are so smart but they are known to be very protective and she is getting to that age. I have also heard that female shepherds are more aggressive in general.     Go to classes so she meets other dogs in a safe envrioment with the help of a trainer.|`|thpFyZuqaa	Hey there :)  I have a german shepard/Boarder collie cross pup   sounds exactly like my dog used to be, but its true, she'll grow out of it as she gets older :)    Watch a TV program "Dog Borstal" its amazing, and the stuff they teach really does work, its how ive trained my dogs.    Sorry i cant help more, but i hope you try watch it if you can to see what i mean, you'll see the results yourself :)|`|8909a781b22eb664e77225df2cbfd163aa	Not much help so far except the one about watching the show. Another show which is great is Its me or the dog. I don't know if you can get it where you are but the stuff she does is amazing.  Your dog/pup will settle eventually but you absolutely need to show her who is boss.  Try a gentle leader harness or halticollar which goes on her head it will give you a lot more control over her on walks.    But watch the shows if you can.|`|AA12192261	she is only a puppy she will get out of it

Or if it is not that bad then use house hold cleaners.|`|yM7xw1lAaa	take what out the piss or the rabbit?|`|xowm9t3kaa	just use stain remover|`|TgT43SM9aa	First up, you shouldn't let your bunny use your boyfriends car!
D1FlyZrcaa	no matter what any one on here says you need to take your kitty to the vet. those masses cant be any sign of anything good. it could be cancer or you could also ask your vet about feline leukemia.     i really hope your kitty gets better. :-(|`|4TX26viFaa	Has the vet done x-rays? Have you gotten a second opinion from a different clinic? Did the vet do a needle biopsy on the lumps? When was her last full panel blood test? All those can tell you a lot more than what you posted.|`|zguucR8yaa	Cancer is definitely possible. She could also have hyperthyroidism. Does your veterinarian know about the distended stomach? And the possibility of fluid build up?  Please don't wait to take her to the hospital.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Only a vet can answer this question and is qualified to do so.  And it sounds like your cat needs to see one regardless what is wrong.  Your Dad is not a vet - time to see a real one.|`|41c28e73f9b063aa3838e17f7834ec97aa	Even if people over the internet could tell you, she may still need surgery, or meds.    Take her to a vet, you can get a true answer and what you need.  It could be old age, but what do I know.    A vet vist is in order.    I wish your porr lil' kitty luck!|`|KLMo9jbzaa	I agree with Bozema your cat is sick and it is not a good idea to take advice from someone who isn't.
fxH6T7vCaa	They dont need any speceil care since there fry will live through there first couple of hours. they eat grounded flakes fish food and when she gives birth will probebly be about earlie morning, her graved spot will be huge.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	Feed her andlet her give birth. Not much you have to do.
syH2DpN7aa	Don't worry, there's nothing wrong. If anything, they might be hungry. Angelfish are ambush predators in the wild, this is how they hunt. Mine quite often sit like this for hours so I dangle blood worms at the surface to make them strike, they move really quickly. Basically they wait until the prey is just above them then they dart upwards and catch them. This is another reason that they are so thin, if prey is above them, they are really hard to see lol.|`|yV8fog7Paa	oxygen levels are low in the water. I have the same problem with my goldfish. I plan on moving to a planted aquarium soon which should bring ocygen into the tank. My 10gal is oxygenated well and only has 3 live plants in them.

In the cichlid family alone, for example, there are at least 2,000 species.  Life is not long enough to do your assignment.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	This certainly isn't them all, but it's a start.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fre...
