aQw4vGdeaa	Wholesale is pretty uncomplicated. Call the manufacturer or contact them via their website. (Whatever the brand of item you want to sell, look them up online). Tell them you would like to purchase wholesale and ask them to give them the name of those in your area. They will give you the number to wholesalers and then you contact them and set up a new account. To set up a new account, you will need a business license and/or a Tax ID number issued through your Tax Commission. In other words, you will need to be a real live registered business. You will need a business credit card as well. It's worth getting the necessary legal work done.<br>  <br>  A little tip, you won't find true wholesale online. Also, if they don't ask for the above mentioned information they are not a true legitimate wholesaler. The wholesaler has to prove that you are going to charge tax in the state that you live in.

In fact banktruptcy is a 10 year mistake.  <br>  <br>  You have made the right step in wanting to pay off your debt and it appears you realized it is not going to happen overnight.  There is a way to get out of the debt you have without having to take out a second job.  The key is you just have to know how and when to pay these debts.  You will also benefit greatly if you can start setting up a budget to determine if there are any non-essential things you can start doing without.  This will only make the process of paying off the debt go faster.  <br>  <br>  The resource below can help you get started in the right direction.  Also, let me warn you.  Don't get a debt consolidation loan.  That is one of the worst things you can do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|gc7El2Ywaa	You may want to consider filing bankruptcy... the financial tool for the rich :)|`|h0wZmFMJaa	Christy, <br>  <br>  As one other person mentioned it depends on your income. <br>  <br>  If you could be a bit more explicit as to your income / debt and expense, it paints a bigger picture. <br>  <br>  1st thing to do it to take a serious look at what you spend your money on and what created the debt. Is the debt credit card or a bunch of miscellaneous stuff. Is it one big account a few lesser ones, or a whole bunch of little ones? <br>  <br>  If you want it done in a year that is not impossible in the least depending on your income.. If your household take home is $50,000, pair down expenses and live on $40,000 (divided by the number of paycheck). <br>  <br>  If after you lay your budget to paper and you see no leeway, then you have a couple things to consider.. You can do something to increase your income, and possibly sell some stuff. <br>  <br>  $10000 in a year = 833.33 month<br>                                = 192.30 week<br>  <br>  You can spend a weekend working at a local retailer and earn $10/hr  20 hours = $2.00 <br>  Depending on your skills you could earn more. For example by doing in home computer repairs (such as virus/spyware removal) <br>  Not even doing hardware repair,  I can gross about $50/hr take out the governments portion of that and you still have about $35/hr. I can write off home business expenses in the process. <br>  <br>  so number one consider and extra job if the budget requires it. <br>  Can you explain your situation a bit more, are you married? ?do you have kids? it changes the flavor of how a person deals with debt. <br>  <br>  As it stands, Budget and put money in a Murphy fund so you don't accrue more debt on credit cards in an emergency. <br>  <br>  Sell some stuff, stuff can be regained when you get out of the hole and when you have cash to buy it. <br>  TV's, clothes you no longer wear, collectibles<br>  <br>  My family is paying about $3500/month on debt.  We had accrued consumer debt to the tune of about $100,000. we've whittle that down to $30,000 in less then 3 years. Plus a 1st mortgage remodeling loan of about $140k, and a rental property with about $60k, We are two years out from paying off all but the 1st and 2nd mortgage. <br>  We got serious about it as we were very close to seeing a lawyer. Someone told us to sell some stuff, we did, we sold the rental property took a bath on it, but got out from under the payment . My wife had raked a card up to $4000 that required it be paid off each month, paid that off in 6 months. while living.  We got real serious after that point. We began truly looking at what we spent money on and got on a weekly budget. My wife no longer goes to the mall, and I no longer go to Home Depot or Cabelas. <br>  We also looked at services that we had that we non-essentials, cable TV and cell phones, we trimmed both down and gained an extra money for the monthly budget. <br>  We don't drive as much either. Gasoline has become a major item in the budget. <br>  We plan out a menu and cook at home, we do not eat out. At one time we were eating out a lot on money that could have went toward kid's college or our retirement. That has stopped altogether. That in it's self amounted to about $1200/month. <br>  <br>  Some things to think about. <br>  You truly might want to consider looking at a program called Financial Peace and Total Money Makeover, the goal of these programs are "Living like no one else, now, so later you can live like no one else".  Check out the link listed in the "source" below, there is a lot of useful and free information. Also if you don't have an accountability partner such as husband or father, speak to them about your situation and ask if they'd be willing to help you budget, not pay off the debt for you but help you achieve the goal through emotional support. <br>  This keeps you on track to meet your goal. <br>  <br>  <br>  We love what the author says, "Don't be Normal, Normal is broke and in debt. " Think outside the box, all things are possible.. The best thing to do when you are in a hole, is to quit digging and start climbing. <br>  <br>  Is there significance to the "One Year"? or is it just a goal? <br>  In order to move that money in a year, you HAVE to me motivated to change, by doing so, you could change your family tree.|`|hc7k19zEaa	Gamble|`|jmKkoQmxaa	Sell any assets that will make a meaningful impact on your debt.

I can't believe you're considering letting your secured and unsecured loans go delinquent. Let me put somethings in prospective for you. <br>  <br>  1. You will be sued. If you don't pay your creditors you may have a few months before the first debt collector contacts you. If they can't acheive any results then expect to be summoned to appear in court. Once they have a judgement against you they can garnish your wages, put a lien on your house, seize personal property and levy your bank accounts! <br>  <br>  2. YOU'RE 21. Don't you realize how young you are? I'm sure when you wrote this you forgot about the baby in the background or the technical college you'd like to attend. In today's society you can't live without credit. If you take care of it, it will take care of you. Remember, you have to pay for school somehow! <br>  <br>  3. If you have good credit right now keep it good! Take out a consolidation loan and pay off your credit card debt. This way you have only one payment to make instead of 15 minimum payments. <br>  <br>  4. Chapter 13 - If you can't afford the debt you have inccured then consider filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Don't file Chapter 7 as you'll need that when you get your divorce. :||`|AA10201384	do whatever you can to maintain your good credit for future purposes.  The worst thing to do is run away; instead call your credit card company or banks who have loaned you money and explain your situation.

This will help you to stay afloat.  Of course, you will eventually run out of things to sell.  During that time you can be working on paying off some of those debts.  <br>  <br>  When I was in over $30k of debt I thought I would never get out.  I went online and started doing a lot of research on ways to get out of debt.  There are some good resources out there, but also let me warn you there are also many scams.  After about 4 months of searcing I ran across a website that provided some good reviews on getting out of debt and credit repair.  What I learned from one of their resources showed the secret to paying off your debt is how you pay it and when to pay it.  By knowing this you can pay off your debt without getting a second job.  <br>  <br>  I will tell you, paying off the debt will not happen overnight.  It has taken me over two years and I still have over $5k left to pay. <br>  <br>  With a little research you will can easily find out just how to pay off these debts.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|mCjG7EhDaa	1) take care of your family 1st - make sure you have enough money for clothes, food, utilities and a roof over your head<br>  2) sell what you don't need right now and try to make money as quickly as possible so that you do not go into further default on your credit debts.  Sell the truck and live off the one car that works (esp if the wife is not working).  <br>  3) avoid bankruptcy at all costs.  This will be removed from your credit after 7 years, only if chapter 13 is filed.  If the house is included in the bankruptcy, (which is chapter 7), it will stay on your credit for 10+ years.  Bankruptcy is not a quick answer to solve the problem.  Do whatever you can to avoid it.  You will be glad you did years down the road from now.<br>  4) as far as the statute of limitations go, I do not think you are correct on that one.  The credit that you do not pay does not just disappear.  It may be sold to collection companies that accrue even further interest which will make it close to impossible for you to pay. <br>  5) it is great that you have a low house payment.  Please please please make sure that you do not default on the loan.  I worked at a foreclosure firm in Georgia for 5 years and Georgia has one of the fastest foreclosure process in the nation. All it takes is (approx) 2-3 months delinquency and your mortgage company will refer your file to a law firm which will start the foreclosure process.  Once at the firm it will only take around 6 weeks for the home to be foreclosed.  <br>  <br>  My main suggestion is to drastically change everything you are spending money on for now until your wife finds employment to stay afloat.  Do not damage your credit history for a bad moment in time.|`|DTohGZUhaa	I'm not sure how it works in Georgia, but from experience, waiting seven years for those credits card debts to go away does not work.  Some companies keep selling these accounts and every time they are sold the seven years keeps renewing so they almost seem as if they will never go away.  I would try to consolidate as much debt as I could with a consolidating company to get the interest rates down and also your monthly payments will not be as much.

7256a722eea2412efb7f021f7774652daa	Even established publishers have problems getting advertising into new publications. Some agencies have specific policies that prohibit advertising in any new magazines for the first 12 months - mainly because so many fail during that time.<br>  <br>  What you should do is produce a professional media kit. Highlight where the magazine will be distributed, perhaps an editorial calendar for the first 6-12 issues, who your writers are and who your intended reader will be. Look at the problem from the buyers perspective - they want to be sure that their message will be read and acted on, so you need to give them all the information to make sure they are confident in your magazine.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the previous comment about starting with a lower advertising price. If you do that you will never be able to raise the price. Start high because you can always discount, although don't discount too much as that sends the wrong message. You should offer discounts for advertisers who want to book a series of ads but try to avoid it when they book just one. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tT6qX6YBaa	You have to assure them where the magazine is going to be seen, by how many people, by what kind of people (it has to be people that can be potential costumers for them); you have to make them like the magazine and in a way make them want to be part of it.  At the begining charge them little for the ad, and grow slowly as the quality and service of you magazine becomes more important.<br>  Good luck!
fSlZQzS4aa	Supply and demand.  Just like always.|`|AA11173563	one home at a time makes the market go up or stagnate or drop. The group as a whole gets affected by each sale in any given area|`|Qa3FHeeXaa	The price is determined by demand. So in New York City where demand is higher a house of the same size would cost more than in Jackson, Mississippi.|`|OWgM5eQFaa	SUPPLY and DEMAND! BUYERS!|`|sSLLty8Uaa	The value of the market is determined by how the individual houses are selling.  If individual houses are selling at above the list price, then the market is increasing.  If the individual houses are selling below list, then the market is decreasing.  A house may be listed for $200,000, and that may be its worth on paper, but if a buyer is not willing to pay $200,000, then the house does NOT have a value of $200,000.  It ALL depends on what the house can sell for.<br>  <br>  Back when every lender was approving every potential borrower, people were buying more expensive homes because their lenders were approving them for bigger mortgages.  It was a "seller's market."  Someone with a $200,000 home could have 5 different potential buyers vying for that one house, battling it out with each other and each trying to present the best offer.  So it's possible the seller could accept an offer that was $25,000 ABOVE their list price.  That new higher price then affects the "comparables" of the area -- how much a house can sell for, based on what other similar houses in the area have sold for.  Multiple experiences like this would push the market higher and the value of homes higher.  It all comes down to what people are willing to spend.  <br>  <br>  Now, however, we're finding that maybe $225,000 was too much for that house, really.  Maybe $200,000 was too much.  And now maybe there's someone who's willing to pay $150,000 but not a penny more. And maybe THAT is because the stricter approval practices limit what a buyer can qualify for, mortgage-wise.   If that's the only person who's willing to pony up any money, the homeowner has a choice:  sell for that lower amount, or refuse to accept the offer and continue owning the house and making mortgage payments on the house.  If the homeowner makes the deal -- perhaps because they're desperate to get out from under a house they can't really afford -- then the lower price of THAT house will have an affect on the other houses in the neighborhood.  It's that "comparables" thing again.  <br>  <br>  Another problem is that there's too much supply in the housing market right now.  Too many houses for sale, and not enough buyers.  This could be because people can't get the mortgage approval to buy a home, or it could be because there's so much new construction, that people who are in the market go in that direction, rather than buying a home that is 5, 10, 15, or 20 years old, because old homes often require maintenance or cosmetic upgrades, whereas new houses generally don't.  And the basic law of supply and demand is that the more plentify an item is -- the higher the supply -- the more affordable it is.  The rarer something is -- the lower the supply -- the more expensive something is.

A jealous coworker who has been lazy about advancement may see you doing well and try to stop you and pull some seniority garbage.

It doesn't take that long and it looks good to add that to your resume or something when you apply for school to study LPN. LPN's do lots of paper work and record everything. They don't totally have to do what CNA's do but then again... even they have to do work sometimes.

I figured that because of the "nursing shortage" that it would be fairly easy for me to obtain a job after I graduated, but most places are saying they want one year of experience before they will hire a new grad.  and there are many many many people looking for jobs everywhere.  i guess it depends on where you are living.  depending on your academic goals, and your location, you should also see how long the waiting lists are to get into whatever program you are looking for because many nursing programs have looooong waiting lists|`|AA11905863	I'm going to school to become an LPN.

The broker can up the rate to try to cover some of the cost or you can pay it upfront.<br>  <br>  If you were paying it up front, my rate to day would be 6.875% with closing costs of $500 plus recording + $3500 = $3,850.<br>  <br>  If you don't plan to hold the property very long, then it could make sense to increase the rate to cover some of the adjustment, but you will get to a point where it doesn't make sense to do that.<br>  <br>  We also have some portfolio programs for that scenario where you would just pay .5% + $500 + all third party fees.

When a product is as expensive as the Oreck vaccuum cleaner is (it is very expensive) they want to assure that you will buy it EVEN THOUGH it costs so much. So they give you a freebie or two.

You file a schedule C with your form 1040 to report income and expenses.  You will also need to file a schedule SE.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to track your expenses because you will pay income tax at your regular tax rate and self-employment tax at a rate of 15.3%.  These taxes are calculated on profit.  If the tax you owe at the end of the year is $1000 or less, you do not need to file quarterly estimated taxes.  If it is more than that, you need to use form 1040-ES to file estimated tax payments quarterly or pay penalties at the end of the year for not paying quarterly.<br>  <br>  I do not know how PA state taxes are, but here in WA your occupation would be considered a Service, not retail.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	You don't need an EIN unless you have employees.  <br>  <br>  You'll just use your SS#, and put your income and expenses on Schedule C.

1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	Mortgages are usually not "transferrable" to other buyers by the owner. In order to assume the mortgage payments, your renters would have to qualify for a mortgage on their own and ask your lender to assume your mortgage payments. However, there is a way to do this:<br>  <br>  You should go see an attorney and have him draw up a "rent to own" agreement--or what is called a "Land Contract" sale. That's the situation you describe.  You will still be liable for the payments if they decide to back out, but if they do, after signing a land contract, then YOU have legal recourse for recovering their default. BUT...you will still owe the property taxes, and be responsible for your escrow account for your insurance, and so forth. The attorney can give you a lot more information about your rights and theirs in such a deal.<br>  <br>  Word of caution: most people buy on land contract because they cannot qualify for a mortgage of their own. And when that's the case, there are usually very good reasons they don't qualify--they have too much debt already, they are not going to be good credit risks, they are unable to afford it, etc. etc. <br>  <br>  It's probably better to simply RENT your house to them, hire a local property manager to oversee their tenancy and make them sign an ironclad lease--with a sufficient security deposit for damages, and in case they don't pay. That way you keep the house, you keep the tax deduction, you keep the property for your own credit, and you don't have to worry about your tenants defaulting on your deal. And it's basically the same deal as the land contract--either way, you're a landlord with all the headaches that entails.|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	Can you afford the mortgage on the house and afford easily to reside in another area?

moiMSUYYaa	You should contact a commercial REALTOR who will work with you in finding the kind of business for which you are looking. Very often a business owner wants to sell but will only reveal this fact under a strict confidentiality agreement signed by the prospective buyer.<br>  <br>  These owners do not want to jeopardize their business by sending the wrong message to either their employees or their customers. It is common practice to keep locations, names and other sensitive information from competitors.<br>  <br>  When you do find something that interests you take a due diligence period to confirm that everything that is being disclosed is correct. You will want to examine the sales volume, expenses, value of inventory and equipment. Additionally, you may want to know first hand what the lease agreement is and if it is renewable. <br>  <br>  If you are purchasing real estate you will want an appraisal and confirmation that the building and land are correctly zoned and have no defects.<br>  <br>  All of this is just for starters. If you are a novice then you need professional help by your REALTOR, attorneys, appraisers, accountants and so forth depending on the size and price of what you intend to buy. Do not skimp on what needs to be done or you will be kicking yourself later.<br>  <br>  These kinds of ventures are not for sissies and you will have to spend some money before making any purchase.|`|1yyfXr7oaa	If u wana earn money online working from home<br>  then u can joint the online money making programs<br>  listed here<br>  <a href="http://earnmoneyonlinecash30.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://earnmoneyonlinecash30.notlong.com</a><br>  work part time n with time your income will<br>  be more than full time

5e7ce1410439b59df8ff094631f563a1aa	PR covers such a wide range of different activities, so that's why you probably get a lot of different answers about pay and job opportunites. On average, I'd say coming out of school you will probably start somewhere in the low 30s as far as pay in concerned, but again, all that changes with what you decide to do with your degree. You could work at an agency (advertising, marketing or PR, entry level = 30-35), you could freelance your services out (you set your own prices), you could work for a big company in their communications dept (every major company has one, entry level = up to 45 maybe) or you could start your own business (again, you set your own prices and manage your profits vs loss). <br>  <br>  Also, sometimes job opps are base plus commission, so that can give you the opportunity to make more or less money. Just to give you an idea of the range of work you can do in PR i'll give you some examples of the past companies i've worked for: Sony / Columbia Pictures PR Dept, TalentZoo.com (a PR/Advertising/Marketing job board), Gemstone Management (an Event Management Agency), Phoenix Classic Communications Dept (A clothing company), and now I freelance because I'm pregnant and due any day.... Like I said, it's a very broad field with the opportunity to work in a lot of different areas...<br>  <br>  Also, the amount you make depends on where you live...

gdULS7bTaa	Since your position is being eliminated, I wouldn't worry about it, and resign on the Friday.  If I was your manager, I would understand since your job is being eliminated.  Take the three days pay, it's the least they can give you. They don't have to know when the new company offered you the job that is your own business.  Apologize for the short notice but you didn't want to miss this opportunity since your job is being eliminated.<br>  <br>  This might help:<br>  Resignation Considerations<br>  <br>  Before you resign, consider the following:<br>  <br>  1. The Company Resignation Policy<br>  <br>  Find out how your company treats resigning employees before you hand in your resignation letter. You may give two weeks notice but two minutes after your boss receives your resignation letter you may find yourself standing in the parking lot without your personal belongings.<br>  <br>  Some companies consider the day you announce your resignation your last day of employment. If you are unsure, ask a few trusted fellow employees whether they know company policies and how previous resignations have been handled. Don't give your employer excessive advance notice when you may be dismissed immediately.<br>  <br>  2. Your Legal Rights<br>  <br>  By resigning, you may forfeit severance pay, unemployment benefits, stock options, and other forms of compensation. Make sure you carefully examine any employment contracts or other agreements that you signed. If you are considering leaving the company for reasons of harassment or discrimination, consult an attorney before signing any documents or submitting a resignation. Your letter of resignation may be used in a lawsuit or other legal action. Never put in writing what you may regret later.<br>  <br>  3. Preparation<br>  <br>  If your company's exit policy requires you to vacate as soon as you give notice, make sure you have "cleaned up" before you submit your resignation.<br>  <br>  Gather all of your personal files from your computer and office and any other personal belongings that you will want to take with you. Many employers will not allow an employee access to computer equipment, the network, or their work space once they have announced their intention to leave. If your home budget, e-mail, resume, or other personal files are on your computer, you may not see them for a period of time, if ever. Back them up on a CD-R before you announce your resignation if you do not already have copies at home.<br>  <br>  Any questionable material in your work space or on your computer may be used by a disgruntled employer as leverage to withhold compensation or to create other problems for you. Make sure that you are prepared for an immediate exit if this were to happen.<br>  <br>  4. Counter offers<br>  <br>  Letters of resignation should never be used to solicit a counteroffer. This tactic is not a professional way to negotiate a better salary.<br>  <br>  If you are a valuable employee, your employer may make a counteroffer, but before you jump at the chance to stay for a few extra dollars (or a lot of non-binding verbal promises), consider the following:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Although you may be given a counteroffer, your loyalty to the company may now be in question. You tried to leave once; will you do it again as soon as you receive a better offer?<br>      *<br>  <br>        Is the counteroffer a temporary way of keeping you until business slows down or a replacement is found?<br>      *<br>  <br>        If you had to resign to get a raise or promotion, is this really the right company for you?<br>      *<br>  <br>        Is the counteroffer giving you a pay boost that you would have received at an annual review anyway?<br>      *<br>  <br>        If you have already accepted an offer from another employer, retracting your acceptance will not be looked on favorably and might damage your future chances for employment with that company.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Consider carefully your initial reasons for resigning. Will the promised changes resolve the issues that led to your decision?<br>  <br>  5. Reality Check<br>  <br>  The National Employment Association claims that over 75% of employees that accept counteroffers are no longer with that company six months later, either through voluntarily leaving or dismissal. Still, there may be circumstances in which a sincere counteroffer is extended, evaluated, and accepted.<br>  <br>  With the above cautions in mind, you can be prepared to make a wise decision. If you have thought through your decision carefully, stick to it and move on.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.writeexpress.com/resignation-letters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.writeexpress.com/resignation-...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats on your new job.  
WVMhVTGwaa	What you are wanting to do is called putting yourself in title with your husband. Typically, a quit claim deed is all that is needed. The "grantor" on the quit claim deed would be your husband. The "grantee" would be your husband and yourself. In short, the quit claim deed transfers title (ownership) from one party to another party. In this case, you will be going from single ownership to joint ownership.<br>  <br>  I did my own during my divorce by going to my local office supply store and purchasing a blank quit claim deed. It is a fairly self-explanatory document where all you have to do is fill in the blanks, sign, have it notarized and filed at your local courthouse. The fees vary for that but are relatively cheap ($100.00 or less, typically.) <br>  <br>  As far as the document goes, the basics are date, how you want your names to read as far as legal ownership, the property address, and the property legal description. For instance, "Lot 1, Block 2, Paradise Subdivision, County of Ocean, State of Florida." This can be obtained from your current deed and/or title work. Also, there will be a dollar amount. In my case, I chose $10.00. You can choose whatever you like because the main purpose here is just to change legal ownership.<br>  <br>  If you decide to go this route and do it on your own, you could always call a local reputable title company if you have questions on how to complete. Most will help you over the phone free of charge.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! |`|ZCKDkqUGaa	adding your name to the deed is simple.

Even if you father-in-law removed himself from ownership, he still has a responsibility to the bank for the loan.

(I happen to have coverage for up to $500 worth of massage therapy w/a doctors prescription per year, but that is an extremely rare benefit.)<br>  <br>  For the rare client of yours who would get some sort of reimbursement, the charge for your service has very little to do with what you'll actually get paid.  The insurer will allow what they determine to be the usual and customary rate, and that's all you'll get.  You will either have to write off the balance, or bill the patient for the balance (if allowed).|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	You can charge whatever you want.

Make sure you differentiate between the two and have explanations ready as to how they differ.  This will help when insurance reps & attorneys start asking questions.<br>  <br>  Also set out separate fee structures for Clients and Patients.

Vl4ZLrf5aa	Realtors get paid on commission.<br>  <br>  When a house is sold, the sellers pay typically a 6% commission; half goes to the listing office, and half goes to the selling office. That 3% is cut again with a portion going to the broker and a portion to the Realtor. Most splits for beginning or low producing Realtors is 50-50. Higher producers may see a 60-40 or 70-30 split.<br>  <br>  So, on a $100,000 house which generates a $6000 commission, about $1500 would go to the agent. The salary range depends on how good of an agent the person is, how hard he works, and the value of the property he sells.<br>  <br>  When I was in the biz, in my community a good agent made between $35,000-$50,000 a year. An outstanding agent could make between 2 to 3 times that. An average agent made about $20,000.|`|qBCGH52haa	Real estate agents work on commission, so their salary depends solely on the number of houses they sell, either through a listing or acting as a buyer's agent.

However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has some average on highly paid agents.  From their web site:<br>  <br>  How much does this job pay?<br>  <br>  Most real estate agents do not get a regular paycheck. Instead, they get part of the money that the home buyer pays to the home seller when a house is sold. This means that agents who sell more houses earn more money. It also means that agents who sell more expensive houses earn more.<br>  <br>  The middle half of all real estate agents earned between $26,790 and $65,270 a year.

The UAW recently agreed to take over the health insurance program for retirees, so you'd have to ask them about the status of that program.

RhEhzGbraa	The insurance company should have advised you that the vehicle was a total loss and then proceeded to make you a settlement offer for the vehicle.  In the majority of the cases they make two offers one in which they keep the vehicle and sell it for the salvage value and the second offer letting you keep the vehicle and they deduct the salvage value.  In addition in the majority of states they also include the cost to obtain a replacement title, transfer or replacement of the tags and any state tax based on the current value of the vehicle.  <br>  <br>  In many cases the balance that is owed to a bank is less than what the vehicle is worth in terms of the total loss settlement which is where Gap insurance comes in to play--the Gap insurance company pays the difference between the settlement offer and what the bank is owed.  <br>  <br>  Your question is not totally clear--if your car's actual cash value as of the date of the loss is $23,000 then the insurance company would owe you the difference between the $23,000 and the $15,000 they have already paid your bank or $8,000 as long as they agreed  that this is the actual cash value of the car.  <br>  <br>  If you purchased the vehicle for $23,000, then depending on when you purchased it, how many miles you have driven it and its condition prior to the loss, the actual cash value can be significantly lower.<br>  <br>  Bottom line ask the insurance company how much they valued the vehicle at and how did they determine their offer.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|QUjJELtVaa	Gap coverage pays the difference between what your car is worth and what you own on the car.  If you car is worth less than $15,000 you won't receive any payment.

The only exclusions for withdrawals of IRAs is for charitable donations, rollovers, withdrawals of contributions made that year before the due date of the tax return (so if they had withdrawn funds from the contributions they had made in 2008 it would have been okay) or the return of nondeductible contributions.  Unfortunately it's really too late to do anything now and if they had asked before they made the withdrawal you could have advised them what to do then.  Now they just have to pay the taxes.

AA11231695	Have you checked out Oprah's "Debt Diet"?  I do not have the link off hand (sorry).<br>  I usually advise clients to do some or all of the following (depending on how far in debt they are):<br>  1) cut up all but 2 credit cards and use those only for emergancies (also call the companies and cancel the cut up cards)<br>  2) create a livible budget that you can adhere to<br>  3) chart all purchases/expenses and see where you can create "free" cash<br>  4) withdraw only a certain amount of money each week.  That is all the cash that you have for the week - keep in mind any activities that you have occuring said week and spend your cash appropriately.<br>  5) get a personal accountability partner - someone that you share your weekly spending with (like a list) and will give you additional encouragement/punishment (for lack of a better word) when needed<br>  6) create a savings account that is only for your "wants" - you can not overdraw a savings account and you can only use what is there.<br>  <br>  For the clients that are seriously out of hand, I usually recommend that they make their account "2 singatures for withdrawal" - that way you are not able to withdraw funds without the second account holder present.<br>  I hope I was able to help!|`|951eb6a95a3b7623fa08a529aa9320f9aa	make a budget, then create an envelope for each category, only spend whats in the envelope|`|b074086a2f9c20e24c9be7e7db755e4aaa	make a budget!!! :D<br>  or buy a creditcard haha|`|5a0247a34cad5aab0ac9db054aa53941aa	I've made over 500 dollars this month just by trying out free trials, taking surveys, and refering friends!

But do you pay cash or with plastic (credit or debit card). If yes, you might find it interesting to know that it's way easier to spend "real" cash as opposed to credit or debit cards.

ww12lItvaa	I think pilots did have it real good. But they also work hard for a couple of weeks, like 80 hours a week these days, then are on standby for a week then a week off.  And they are paid well. <br>  <br>  But while working and on standby they can't drink a drop because you can't have had a drink for a lot of hours before flying. <br>  <br>  And pilot jobs are very hard to get. I read even years ago, and it is harder now, that for 5 positions they had over 2,000 "well qualified" applicants with many hours under their belts. <br>  <br>  I have known a number of pilots all my life. And several had to fly in places, routes, jobs, that they didn't like to build the hours to fly commercial flights. Like running cargo in Alaska or inter-island overseas. They had to do that many years before getting a second seat on one of the big birds. <br>  <br>  The good news is that many of the other pilots came from the military where they had trained so many for WWII and later Vietnam. Those experienced pilots filled the need for commercial work later. They logged many hours in the service.<br>  <br>  And now many of those are retiring, and WWII pilots are long retired. <br>  <br>  There is a shortage of very qualified pilots now. China is rushing training for their needs.  <br>  <br>  The military would be a good place to get trained. You might start young with taking lessons in small planes to help you get a job as a pilot in the service. And you will need a college degree of course.<br>  <br>  Also you could start now with language training for places you might fly. While english is the standard language for flying not all places have people that speak the language fully. So learning other languages will help you get a job. <br>  <br>  It is possible if you start on your desired course now.
a69669623feae1ab9569602fb1705468aa	You have to start thinking S-M-A-R-T. What kind of cutbacks can you make? For example: I drink bottled water. Now at $1 a bottle on something that covers over 65% of our planet is not smart. So I bought one of those water filters that screw into your faucet. I have bottles that I refil over and over again. I take them to work. Do you have a lot of small appliances around that house that are always on? I cut my electronic bill almost in half by unplugging all the clock radios and night lights. I also bought some of those florescent bulbs that look a lot like a regular bulb. These things use 80% less electricity than regular bulbs. Ave 60Watt incalescent bulb runs you 2 cents per hour. Ave 60Watt energy bulb averages 0.5 cents per hour. You would be surprised, but these small things add up. I know I was spending money on the water filter and energy efficient bulbs but these things will pay for themselves in a month providing they pertain to you. If you really need the money right away start cutting back on your food costs. Romain noodles cost a dime and they taste just as good as campbells chicken noodle that costs $130 a can. Ok no chicken in romain noodles, but you are probably just missing about 4 tiny pieces of chicken. Adjust your toilet to use lesser water. If you don't know how to do this then put a brick inside your toilet 'chamber'. You will use a little lesser water each time you flush..Before you know it you will be ahead. Wanna be creative? Find yourself leaving lights on? Buy a motion sensor switch, the lights will turn on when you enter the room and will turn off (by a set amount of time) when you leave the room. I have one, they cost $15 at HomeDepot. Need new windshield wipers for your car? Who says you have to buy 2? You only need the new one on the drivers side, leave the old wiper on the passenger side.  So remember you have to start thinking S-M-A-R-T!

You won't be able to get that deal because it is for new accounts.<br>  <br>  What you can do is what you already plan on doing.<br>  Re-negotiate with your landlord for a lower monthly rent. Chances are he will go along because otherwise... you could just move out and find a cheaper place and he would have to offer your place at the current lower rent if he wants to find a renter.<br>  If you are on a lease... you won't be able to negotiate until your lease is up. Both parties agreed to the monthly rent when they signed a lease agreement. Sometimes it backfires...|`|PxoKseAiaa	It is legal, just like it is legal for the cable company to give *new* customers 4 mos free or 1/2 price on their bill...those commercials make me frustrated too, because, here, I have been a loyal customer for years..and I don't get a price break! LOL  <br>  <br>  I see this all the time, someone moves in then months later (sometimes weeks) sees a promotion the apt complex is having.  You can try to negotiate, but don't expect miracles.  It is at the owner or corporations discretion if they want to deal with you.  Most likely, they won't, and that is where you hold the power when your lease is up and you go to a new apt that is having the lower rent, or move in special.. !|`|pt6wIlS1aa	It's legal for them to do it, and it's legal for you to negotiate for the lower rate. If you threaten to move, they'll probably come down.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	It's quite legal and quite common.  If your in a current lease, don't expect the landlord to renegotiate until your lease expires.|`|RZzMse3Haa	That is perfectly legal and quite standard.  They do that to attract new tenants.  All rents in a complex are NOT required to be the same.  The rents in any unit but yours are none of your business.  <br>  <br>  You have no grounds to negotiate and have no leg to stand on.

CL9zXIA7aa	Your credit scores are low, sounds like you have unverified income and are a tax cheat. Your chances of getting a home loan are slim.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	No, banks want a 700 or more credit score.  They also are asking for 20% down.  If you are paid cash, you have to prove income by a w'2 or tax return.  Since your wife started a new job, they may look down on this.  Depends on how long she was at the previous job.|`|AA11966821	Not a chance.  Your best chance for obtaining a mortgage is 20% down plus closing costs saved up, credit scores of 700+, at least 2 - 3 years track record on the job.  The employer has to verify employment, with a statement regarding prospects for continued employment.  You have to produce the last 3 years of tax returns.  Even with all this, we are still seeing clients getting to closing dates with approved mortgages, and funding is "delayed."  While lending is easing marginally, it is mostly in the bond market, not in commercial and retail lending.|`|4f3GfrN6aa	Not good at all, I'm afraid.<br>  <br>  Firstly, you need to prove your income.  You will need payslips.  It will also help if you bank your income on payday, even though you are paid in cash.  <br>  <br>  Your wife needs to be employed for longer before you will qualify for a loan.  Give it 6-12 months, and use that time to save for your downpayment.  You will need at least 20% of the purchase price of the house.  This will mean that you don't need to pay mortgage insurance, which protects the bank in case you default.  Less than 20% and the lenders are not willing to give you a loan without it.  It's an extra cost you will need to pay that will not help you pay off your home, so save the big downpayment and avoid it.<br>  <br>  You will also need to save some money for pest and building inspections, and taxes and stamp duty, depending on where you live.<br>  <br>  Don't try to rush this.  Wait it out and be properly financially prepared before you try to get a loan.  If you try now, you won't get a good deal, because you're not a good risk to the lenders.  Minimise other debts and always pay bills on time.  That will help your credit scores.
pRibsCSXaa	Depending on your entire debt load, and the loan you want, you may not have to be concerned with using your income.  Your wife makes over $5k/month.  If the new loan and all of your other obligations is less than $2100 or so, you may be able to get the loan.|`|PxoKseAiaa	How long have you worked for your father?<br>  Do you claim that *cash* on your tax return?  Do you have 2 years of tax returns to show the lender?<br>  Your scores are both really low, but, I have heard FHA deals with lower scores, it just depends on other factors.<br>  How long has your wife been a nurse?  <br>  Does she have 2 years of nurse work history?<br>  <br>  I would say with your scores and whether you file taxes your chances are on the weak side.  Might need to wait another 18 mos so you can bring up your scores and file 2 years of tax returns.  <br>  <br>  Go talk to a lender who deals with FHA. They will tell you.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/fhahistory.cfm - Cached<br>  <br>  FHA does not make loans they guarantee them.<br>  <br>  You would need to find a lender that deals with FHA "loans".<br>  <br>  In general you may only need 5% down and could in some cases roll the closing cost into the loan. But it is a case by case situation.<br>  <br>  If you have the 5%, are in general debt free and can afford the mortgage payments... you should at least give it a try.<br>  <br>  Run a search on FHA and FHA insured loans to read up on their website what the steps are you need to take.

When mortgages get brought and sold, the terms dont change and the original signed paperwork is still in force . You should be able to get original docs from the lender who is foreclosing. Just call their servicing department and ask for them to be faxed to you.  You signed the original paperwork, and its in the file they have on you.   You should also check your records, you probably have the paperwork you signed somewhere.

2ac1d4423b273643309cd77f9e43d50faa	I can only tell you what I did...<br>  <br>  Since you've already fallen behind in your payments, stop making them altogether. After 3 months, they will turn them over to a credit collection. Deal with them for 6 months. Then the credit card company will call you and make you a good deal. $30 a month out of your checking account for 2 years and then back stable again. And each time they collect a payment, they put a big A+ back on your credit report. (oh, and no interest added or late payment charges for the 2 years, either).<br>  <br>  And when they reinstated my card after all that time, the interest rate was reduced greatly and they upped my credit limit. Go figure. Anyways, it worked well all the way around. Now I am more financially fit to handle it.<br>  <br>  They can be jerks until they see that you are SERIOUS about not having the money to pay them, then they back down.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3Ol7aut2aa	You need a professional company working on your behalf.

If you are way behind, and they won't take payments, do this, leave them alone, stop calling them, stop answering them, put away as much money in a savings as you can, when you have about 1/3 of what you owe them, call them and offer a settlement.  99 times out of a 100 they will settle for 1/3 of what you owe them.

Ask to speak with their supervisor and see what they can do.<br>  <br>  Beyond that I would not recommend a debt mgmt program. Even if it means taking on a 2nd job for a few months.

LpVwWJVsaa	Contact your local police department.  Noise complaints can be violations of the lease agreement, but not cause for early termination of your lease agreement.  Once you have reported it to the police, give copies to your landlord. Keep a paper trail about the noise violations, it will help you later, should you have a problem with your landlord in your future.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RZzMse3Haa	That is not legal grounds to break your lease.

If the landlord wont help you with his own tenants, then by all means call the police on a daily basis until you get satisfaction.  Apartment living stinks because of this type of situation.  If you become enough of a pest, he may let you out of your lease anyway.....good luck....thats a bad place to be in when you cant get any sleep at night...maybe get a sound machine at night to drown out some noise??|`|4UBxVIYFaa	The landlord isn't responsible for that situation.  If the neighbors are disturbing the peace, then call the police about it.  Noisy neighbors are not a valid reason for early lease termination.
Pjm9pg7iaa	There are 2 types:<br>  The rent is raised by $400 a month. After one year, this extra $4,800 is credited as the down payment.<br>  Or the rent is not raised and the renter saves the down payment themselves.<br>  The problem comes when the landlord collects the rent but does not pay the mortgage. The house is foreclosed before the renter can become a buyer..|`|PxoKseAiaa	All rent to own contracts are different. Some will give you 12 mos some 36 mos to get your finances in order and apply for your own loan.  Not all contracts will give you a rent credit either. It is at the sole discretion of the person who owns the house.  If they do give you a rent credit and you are able to buy the place in the time allotment they give you, the rent credit will go towards the purchase price as part of the down payment.  Also, any down payment you had to pay to get in the house (some are as high as 3% of the purchase price) may also go towards the down payment.  <br>   <br>  Rent to own scenarios fall apart a lot of times, and never come to fruition.  The buyer never seems to get the finances or down payment together, or they still cannot get a loan due to their credit.  Only about 20% actually buy the home they were renting to own.  <br>  <br>  The main thing you would want to do is set the price NOW of how much you are willing to pay for the property.  Don't wait for 12 mos to 3 years. (not that values are going to skyrocket, but it's better to set the price now) Get everything in writing and have it looked over by a real estate attorney.  Also make sure that the owner is still held accountable for any major repairs.  Why would you want to replace a water heater or furnace or other huge ticket item in a house you may or may not ever own?<br>  <br>  Remember also, that if you cannot secure financing, or decide you don't like the house afterall..that you lose your deposit and all the rent credits.  That is the penalty usually for not exercising your option to buy the home.  <br>  <br>  Rent is usually a bit higher than the market rate, only because of the rent credit.  I would say on a house that would rent normally for $1000 mo, you might be looking at as much as $1300 to 1500 a month.  It all depends on the owner. <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope you find a house you like and are in a financial position to buy when the term is up!|`|zTau6hDIaa	Read the agreement.

DAMZKbpDaa	First step, file the tax return. That will stop the failure to file penalty.<br>  <br>  Also, you will know at that time how much you owe, approximately. <br>  <br>  There is also a failure to pay penalty, if you owe more than $1,000 (almost a certainty.) <br>  <br>  If your total tax due is under $25,000 (including penalty and interest) the IRS will grant you an installment agreement without question if it pays off the tax liability in five years or less.<br>  <br>  IF that is not the case, you will need to submit some financial documentation to show your ability to pay. The IRS will work with you to help resolve the tax problem. After all, they are trying to collect the tax, and want to cooperate with you to get the money.<br>  <br>  One thing, if you are still a 1099-misc, you will need to make estimated payments, even before the IRS will talk to you. Start now for your 2008 taxes, and continue on. You won't get an installment agreement if it looks like you will default again with your 2008 taxes.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	The first thing you have to do is file the return.  The amount due will be about 140% of the tax due because of late filing penalties and interest. If you can pay the liability off within five years you can have an installment agreement without any questions. Send Form 9465 along with the return.|`|7831010767e13fd92e98f42d4a2ef7aeaa	You should contact the taxpayer's advocate office at the IRS. They will be able to help you with this problem.

xNCIICISaa	I'm not sure exactly about beach jobs, but you could work at a resort or high end (that's what they usually are) hotel near the beach. If you wanted to spend money on getting liscened you could be a massage therapist for resorts/spas. If it comes down to it, there is most likely going to be fast food restraunts near the beach as well. I can tell you the GED may be an obstucle to some employers (I know some people who have them), and can be frowned upon. Not at all that it should be though, because you know the scoring is actually done by comparing what you did to graduating high school seniors scores. (Or so I've heard) but if you have a good personality you may be able to get in the door anyway... I've been on interviews where I may not have been the most qualified, but was offered the job.

Finding a job is not going to be easy.  There are over 2.5 million people out of work at the present time.  You have to get out there now and see what is available.  This is not going to happen overnight.  Jobs are going to people who have skills, experience and are available to work any hours.  So start going in person to find a job.  Employers will not think to much of people calling on the phone to see if they are hiring.  Only file an application on line, if the company requests it.
95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	I really like paypal<br>  <br>  But<br>  <br>  the only things I don't like<br>  <br>  You can tranfer money into it instantly and it will be there....but if you transfer it out into your checking account it can take up to three days..It doesn't make sense to me..if its an electronic transfer and they can put it in instantly...why can't it transfer into a bank account instantly<br>  <br>  And also when accepting credit cards...Paypal will subtract a percentage for each transaction you receive that is used from a credit card. I can add up to being more than just having a credit card terminal.<br>  <br>  If you are using it for ebay..ebay will ONLY allow you to use Paypal as an electronic payment because they are OWNED by ebay.<br>  <br>  If not..Try LINKPOINT.COM<br>  You can accept credit card payments by typing their info in yourself..Its cheaper|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	I like Paypal.  The fees do get expensive, 2.9% of the total amount your are accepting +.30 cents for each transaction.  You can however, pass this amount on to your customer.  If you're selling on eBay, don't put that the customer is responsible for paypal fees tough, or eBay might pull your auction as they don't allow this.  You can put a handling fee on shipping to help cover the cost.  When you transfer money from your paypal account to your checking account, it does take 2-3 days as stated by another answerer, but after I think it's like 6 months of having your paypal account, you can get a paypal ATM card.  It's free with no fees and you can use it at ATM's for a $1 fee per trans. or you can use it as a debit card anywhere and you earn either 1% or 2% back on each debit trans.  Hope this helps!|`|2ee0f368074d8d8807297f0820c39037aa	pay pal is pretty reliable, trustworthy, and charges less fees than many other options.<br>  con is must use the Internet.|`|82757067447398d47807fea4bd2b0185aa	PAYPAL is a great tool for collecting online payments but it is expensive. it however is very safe.|`|AA12041697	when you accept credit cards they take 30 cents plus 2% off the top.  The rates may have gone up to 3%.  It isn't much but if you are receiving payments in small amounts under say 3.00 it seems like they take a lot.  To accept credit cards you have to have a commercial account.  you can only switch back to a regular account (to dodge commercial charges) once. They will not let you do it twice.  But if you are selling and it isn't just for fun, most people will want to pay by credit card.  It will help your business.  The decision is up to you.|`|AA10698098	Pros it is easy,Cons it aint cheap.

KdFXk0ajaa	Personally, no. I owe a minimal amount on one of my many credit cards which I can pay off at any time. I own my home free and clear. My 2008 Hyundai Sonata was paid off a month after purchase. Whenever given the option like auto or homeowners insurance I pay in full. I have 100k in the bank looking for a safe place to earn some money on it. It is set aside for my son's education. The only truly negative experiences I have financially at this time is 400+ shares of Manulife Financial stock that are worth about 35% of what they were as recently as 4 months ago. My son has a few shares of MetLife that have also lost 50% or more of their paper value so I will hold them with the hopes that they make a comeback. Living in Pinellas County, FL I have a home that is worth about 70% of what I paid (but I own it) and get hammered to the tune of $2500 for insurance for it with the first $10,000 coming out of my pocket in the event of hurricane damage. But I have no complaints as my grandfather and father taught me to live within my means.<br>  Most people I know are drowning in debt. I think some folks have no one to blame but themselves as they bought homes they could not afford with balloon payments that they never thought would be a problem.<br>  Others are victims.

That is why we are in the mess we are in. People bought $500,000 homes when they only make $30,000 a year.

oS1TBzL6aa	Stocks are certificates that represent and transfer ownership of a company.  The number of stocks or shares issued and outstanding varies from company to company so each stock represents a different equity percentage.  Dow Jones and Russell are index providers.  An index is basically a representation or biopsy of a larger market; the idea is to measure the performance of a particular asset class.  I assume that you mean the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000.  The Dow is supposed to represent the U.S. stock market and is comprised of 30 components.  The R2K is supposed to represent the U.S. small cap (or small public) sector.  Indices also often have ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that track them.  An ETF is basically a mutual fund that tries to replicate the returns of a particular index.  Stocks don't "do" anything they are pieces of paper.<br>  <br>  Cheers, <br>  A.T. Cunningham|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. For example if a large company has 10 million shares of stock, and you own 10 shares of that stock, it means you own 1/1,000,000 th of the company (one one millionth). If that same company with 10 million shares of stock is valued at $100 million, it would mean that each share of its stock is worth $10. As the value of the company goes up and down, the value of the stock goes up and down. <br>  <br>  Stocks are sometimes called "equity shares" because you literally have partial ownership of the company. Just like equity in your house represents value you have because you own the house, equity shares represent the value of your portion of the company.|`|IJGQCGJlaa	In business and finance, a share (also referred to as equity share) of stock means a share of ownership in a corporation (company). In the plural, stocks is often used as a synonym for shares especially in the United States, but it is less commonly used that way outside of North America.<br>  <br>  So In short, stocks or shares, are ways that companies can make money, buy selling you part ownership of the company.|`|Wpulf29Maa	Stocks are stocks are a share of the ownership of a company initially they are sold by the original owners of a company to gain additional funds to help the company grow. <br>  <br>  How Stocks Work<br>  <br>  It all starts when a company wants to raise money to invest in something they think will be profitable such as a new manufacturing process more production capacity or a new product.  The company can do this a number of ways but the two most popular are to borrow the money or sell part of the company.  Borrowing the money is usually done by issuing a "bond" which is a promise to repay the borrowed money with interest.<br>  <br>  The next most popular way for a company to get money is to sell "stock" in the company.  This is essentially selling a bit of the company and sometimes it carries a promise of getting a split of the profits when there are profits to split.  Stocks are also called "equity" because the owner of the stock has equity or part ownership of the company.<br>  <br>  When a company is formed or incorporated it sets up a certain amount of stock which is worth about as much as the paper it is printed on--stock in its infancy carries no real value outside of the company.  When the original owners of the company need to raise money they have to find good natured people who are willing to invest in small but risky companies and sell this stock person by person one person at a time. A share of stock signifies the holder owns some fraction of the company and possibly allows the owner to enjoy part of the profits of the company.   The stock may have a "face value" given to it when the company was formed but you couldn't walk into a grocery store with $10 worth of this stock and buy a loaf of bread. <br>  <br>  As the company becomes even larger and needs to raise even more money (usually several hundred million dollars) even more stock will be offered on the open market. This is when it gets interesting.  An initial public offering is made of so many shares of stock at a predetermined price say $15 a share.  People who invest in the stock market usually read the Wall Street Journal looking for initial public offerings or IPO's.  At the moment the stock is sold to a shareholder during the IPO it is worth its selling price of $15 a share.   Now at this point you can turn around and sell it for $15 dollars to someone else and then go buy a loaf of bread if someone is willing to pay you $15 dollars for it.  The stock has now gone from being held by a few investors and owners of the company (or closely held) who would have a hard time selling it to being publicly held by thousands of owners who could sell it more easily because it is now being traded through stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or via the NASDAQ.<br>  <br>  Soon after trading hands a few times the people buying the stock now determine the value of the stock by what they are willing to pay for it.  Sometimes the price of a stock that sold for $15 a share at its initial public offering will drop like a rock.  Other times it will skyrocket.  The value of the stock is set by many many people trading it in an free open market.   And even though a person buying a share of stock may be a hundred times removed from the person originally buying the stock from the company at the IPO that person still owns some teeny tiny fraction of the company.  I don't know how they do it but the company keeps track of all their stockholders.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the value of a share of stock is determined by crazes such as the internet which tends to drive the price up quickly but the price may also fall just as quickly when the craze looses it "newness".  More often than not the price of stock is set by how much profit the owner will receive or dividend or by the company's current earnings and their prospects for future earnings.  A company with little hope for the future will be frowned upon by the people wanting to buy their stock and the buyer will not pay very much for it (its price usually doesn't drop to $0 right away as there are optimists and opportunists who will take a chance on disfavored stocks and will keep the price from falling to nothingness over night).<br>  <br>  It's just like trading baseball cards.  When stock is traded on the open market the only reason it is worth so much is because there is someone out there willing to pay that much for it.  No magic no mystery.
AA11503426	You can't just get a job as an entrepreneur. The very word means that you are someone who had a brilliant idea and acted on it. But you admit you have no ideas. Hmmm. Unless you think of something stunning which will fill a gap in the market, your dreams of this entrepreneur career will not materialise.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give is for you to look instead at pursuing something you really enjoy. The very best job is something you would do even if you weren't paid for doing it.<br>  <br>  So think about what you enjoy. If that's too much of a task, something you could at least tolerate doing day in day out for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Love cooking? Be a chef. Like gardening? be a groundsman. Get the idea?<br>  <br>  However, if money is your biggest love, then choose something high paying. A surgeon, a lawyer or a dentist maybe.|`|VFVdrDBQaa	I was the same way.

n560blqraa	Wow, you are going to be very hard pressed to get an FHA loan or any conventional under a 580 FICO. As a real estate investor, I have to say that right now considering what happened in the subprime mortgage loans, which also resulted in FHA making changes to their federally backed loans, you really need to try and pull up that FICO score. If you can pay down some debt and at least pull it to 620 you have a better shot of getting a streamlined loan. <br>  <br>  The answer is simply NO, right now lenders don't want to lend money to anybody, and when they are they have made it so that only no risk customers with high 700's FICO's are getting better interest loans. In reality, a 580 would come with an excessively high interest rate. <br>  <br>  There are "No Doc" loans available but they want to see 10% down and come with over 10%-12% interest on your loan. This would kill you financially! Unfortunately, FHA used to be a hell of a lot more forgiving than conventional, but economically speaking they too have narrowed and closed the gap on high risk lending. <br>  <br>  Best advice try to bring you FICO score up. If you have a lot of little credit card debts pay them off, but keep cards open and don't use. Try and also renegotiate interest rates on credit cards as well. Consolidate any debt you have and reduce down to 1/4. This will help bring FICO up substantially. <br>  <br>  Hope this info helps!!|`|AA11173563	no not now as you will need with most on a 203K streamline either purchase or refinance at least a 600 and with most a 620 score. You must work on that first. sorry not many will even do these loans<br>  If you do get one the rate will be Veryy high on this loan as the lender will charge more like 1.5%-2% over par because they are having a hard time securing these loans on the secondary market<br>  I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY|`|nWKWoJAQaa	I would call Bank of America!!

T1ffrjHAaa	Hi. I run a letting agency in North East UK.<br>  <br>  You need to speak to your agent or Landlord and tell them of what has happened. If they can find a replacement tenant quickly then your obligation will cease and you will still retain your deposit as the Landlord will not have had any loss of rent. That is what i would do in my agency. Obviously they could be fussy and say you are liable for the full term but it really is not in their best interests as any legal order or judgement would be pretty pointless if you do not have the funds anyway.<br>  <br>  Remember that your Landlord is really just interested in getting rent so you should explain what has happened. Also it is not a crime to claim benefits and you should not feel embarrassed about this, especially in today's climate.<br>  <br>  Just so you know it is illegal for a landlord to use the bond as rent DURING a current tenancy so he will only be able to retain it if he accepts that the tenancy is over.<br>  <br>  Sorry, just seen the reason for not claiming benefits. Perhaps if you found a job that requires under 16 hours a week your status would not be affected and you would still qualify for benefits.

paerqxfMaa	It's a nice area in Suffolk County (eastern LI) - it is pretty and still has alot of rural farm property out there.  It's close to beaches.  It is a nice area.  The Island is beautiful during all three season - I just don't like the cold and couldn't take winter anymore.  If I could take all of LI and move it south to a warmer climate, I would still be living there.  There are plenty of things to do - shopping, sports, theater, schools.  Basically, anything you like to do can be done on LI.  Don't know where you are coming from, but there is ALOT of traffic on LI - but I really think they did a great job of road design and traffic flow - oh, it slows down during the rush hours, but overall it's not as bad as people make it out to be.  I do miss LI - try to get back there - at least during the summer - as often as I can.

The assets of the business will eventually be sold.  At that point, the interest above yours (head leaseholder or freeholder) will register the change at the Land Registry, which you can check on line for a small fee.  They should also give you notice.<br>  <br>  If, for whatever reason, that doesn't happen you can purchase, for a small sum, an insurance policy that will cover you against any claims.  Your solicitor will do this for you if you come to sell the house.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the law changed a few years ago and as it's a house then, if it is a small ground rent, the lease cannot be forfeited (if that was your worry) without a proper ground rent demand having been issued and a court order (difficult to get) - and they can only claim 6 years worth of arrears.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	who are you paying rent to then? someone has to own the land - try the county courthouse|`|EXJfoGtAaa	As the previous poster says check the land records at the courthouse.

Pero todo ejecutivo eficaz sigue ocho reglas sencillas.  Un ejecutivo eficaz no necesita ser un líder en el sentido que actualmente se le da a este término. Harry Truman, por ejemplo, no tenía ni una pizca de carisma, pero fue uno de los jefes de Estado más eficaces en a historia de Estados Unidos.  Durante mis 65 a?os de carrera como consultor, algunos de los mejores CEO corporativos y de entidades sin fines de lucro con los que he trabajado no eran líderes estereotípicos. Eran muy diversos en términos de personalidad, actitudes, valores, fortalezas y debilidades. Variaban de extrovertidos a solitarios, de relajados a controladores, de generosos a parsimoniosos. Lo que los volvía eficaces a todos es que seguían las mismas ocho prácticas:<br>  Preguntaban ?Qué hay que hacer? <br>  Preguntaban ?Qué le conviene a la empresa? <br>  Desarrollaban planes de acción. <br>  Asumían la responsabilidad de sus decisiones. <br>  Asumían la responsabilidad de comunicar. <br>  Se centraban en oportunidades en vez de problemas. <br>  Conducían reuniones productivas. <br>  Pensaban y decían “nosotros” en vez de “yo”. <br>  Las dos primeras prácticas les permitían obtener el conocimiento que necesitaban. Las cuatro siguientes les ayudaban a convertir ese conocimiento en acción eficaz. Las dos últimas aseguraban que toda la organización se sintiera responsable. Obtenga el conocimiento que necesita<br>  La primera práctica es preguntar qué hay que hacer. Nótese que la pregunta no es “?Qué quiero hacer?”. Preguntar qué hay que hacer y tomarse el asunto en serio es fundamental para el éxito gerencial. Si no se hace esta pregunta, hasta el más capaz de los ejecutivos se vuelve inútil. Cuando Truman asumió la presidencia en 1945, sabía exactamente lo que quería hacer: completar las reformas sociales y económicas del New Deal de Roosevelt, las que habían sido postergadas por la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Sin embargo, nada más hacerse la pregunta sobre qué había que hacer, Truman comprendió que las relaciones internacionales tenían prioridad absoluta. Organizó su jornada de trabajo de modo que comenzara con informes sobre política internacional que le daban los secretarios de estado y de defensa. Así, se convirtió en el presidente más competente en asuntos internacionales que haya tenido Estados Unidos. Contuvo el comunismo tanto en Europa como en Asia y, con el Plan Marshall, dio origen a 50 a?os de crecimiento económico mundial.  De modo similar, cuando Jack Welch asumió como director ejecutivo de General Electric comprendió que la expansión intercontinental que pretendía lanzar no era lo que había que hacer. Debía deshacerse de las empresas de GE que, independientemente de su rentabilidad, no podían ser la primera o la segunda en sus sectores. La respuesta a la pregunta “?Qué hay que hacer?” casi siempre incluye más de una tarea urgente. Pero los ejecutivos eficaces no se fragmentan. Si es posible, se concentran en una sola tarea. Si son de esas personas que trabajan mejor con un cambio de ritmo en su jornada laboral –una importante minoría–, emprenden dos tareas.<br>  Pero nunca he conocido a un ejecutivo que aborde más de dos tareas a la vez y siga siendo efectivo. Por lo tanto, después de preguntarse qué hay que hacer, el ejecutivo eficaz establece prioridades y se apega a éstas. Para un CEO, la tarea prioritaria puede ser redefinir la misión de la empresa. Para un director de unidad puede ser redefinir la relación de su división con la casa matriz. Las otras tareas, independientemente de su importancia y atractivo, son postergadas. Pero después de completar esa primera tarea prioritaria, el ejecutivo vuelve a definir las prioridades en vez de pasar a la número dos de la lista original. Hace la pregunta “?Qué debe hacerse ahora?”. Ello generalmente conduce a prioridades nuevas y diferentes.<br>  Mencionaremos nuevamente al CEO más conocido de Estados Unidos. Según su autobiografía, cada cinco a?osJack Welch se preguntaba a sí mismo “?Qué hay que hacer ahora?”. Y cada vez daba con una prioridad nueva y diferente. Pero antes de decidir en qué concentraría sus esfuerzos en los siguientes cinco a?os, Welch también reflexionaba sobre otro tema. Se preguntaba para cuál de las primeras dos o tres tareas de la lista estaba más preparado. Luego se centraba en esa tarea y delegaba las demás. Los ejecutivos eficaces intentan enfocarse en trabajos que hacen especialmente bien. Saben que las empresas tienen un buen desempe?o si la alta gerencia se desempe?a bien, y lo mismo al revés. La segunda práctica de los ejecutivos eficaces, que es tan importante como la primera, consiste en preguntar: ?Es esto lo correcto para la empresa?”. No preguntan si es correcto para los due?os, para el precio de las acciones, para los empleados o los ejecutivos. Desde luego, saben que los accionistas, empleados y ejecutivos son actores importantes que deben apoyar una decisión, o por lo menos aceptarla, si optan por ser eficaces.  Ellos saben que el precio de la acción no sólo es relevante para los accionistas, sino también para la empresa, ya que la relación precio-utilidad determina el costo del capital. Pero también saben que una decisión que no es correcta para la empresa, en última instancia tampoco lo será para ninguna de las partes interesadas. Esta segunda práctica es especialmente importante para los ejecutivos de empresas familiares o manejadas por una familia –que son la mayoría de las empresas en todos los países–, sobre todo cuando toman decisiones sobre personas. En una empresa familiar exitosa, sólo se asciende a un familiar si, en términos medibles, es mejor a todos los empleados del mismo nivel. En DuPont, por ejemplo, cuando la empresa aún era manejada como un negocio familiar, todos los altos ejecutivos (excepto el contralor y el abogado) eran parte de la familia propietaria.<br>  Todo hombre descendiente de los fundadores tenía derecho a un trabajo de nivel de entrada en la empresa. Después de eso a un miembro de la familia sólo se lo ascendía si un jurado compuesto principalmente por ejecutivos ajenos a la familia juzgaba que esa persona era mejor, en habilidad y desempe?o, que los demás empleados del mismo nivel. La misma regla se aplicó durante un siglo en la empresa familiar británica J. Lyons & Company, que ahora es parte de un importante conglomerado, cuando dominaba el sector de los servicios alimentarios y hoteleros de Gran Breta?a.<br>  Preguntarse “?Qué es lo correcto para la empresa?” no garantiza que se tomará la decisión correcta. Hasta el más brillante de los ejecutivos es humano, por lo tanto, propenso a errores y prejuicios. Pero no hacerse la pregunta virtualmente garantiza una decisión equivocada.<br>  Escriba un plan de acción.  Los ejecutivos hacen cosas, ejecutan. Para ellos, el conocimiento es inútil hasta que no haya sido traducido en hechos. Pero antes de pasar a la acción, el ejecutivo debe trazar su plan. Debe pensar en los resultados deseados, las posibles restricciones, las futuras revisiones, los puntos a considerar y las consecuencias de la forma en que utilizará su tiempo.|`|6ciaTh6yaa	Mira, mucha capacidad de tomar decisiones, tranquilidad en manejar crisis, capacidad de mando y delegación de funciones.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a la preparación no existe una regla establecida para ello, conocí a varios excelentes ejecutivos sin preparación profesional, intuitivos y realmente oportunos, aunque generalmente se requiere algún con cimiento en administración, economía, finanzas, análisis financieros, y en especial un toque mágico para saber motivar adecuadamente al personal bajo su mando.|`|Dijnlntdaa	51515151515151______51515151<br>  51515151515151_____515151515<br>  51515151515151____5151515151<br>  515151___________51515151515<br>  515151________________515151<br>  515151________________515151<br>  515151________________515151 <br>  51515151515151________515151<br>  51515151515151________515151<br>  51515151515151________515151<br>  ______51515151________515151<br>  ______51515151________515151<br>  ______51515151________515151<br>  51515151515151________515151<br>  51515151515151________515151<br>  51515151515151________515151<br>  ′′′′′′′′′′′?.**..**.<br>  ′′′′′′′′′′??*..**..*<br>  ′′′′′′′′′??? .*.*.*.<br>  ???′′′′′????*..**.*.<br>  ′???????????*.*.**..**. <br>  ′′′?????????????????*.*.*.*.*<br>  ′′′′′?????????????*.*.**.<br>  ′′′′??????????.**.**.*. <br>  ′′′??????????*.*.*.**. <br>  ′′?????′′????*.**.*.*.*<br>  ′??′′′′′′′′???*..**.*.**|`|t4HLg1Rdaa	los conocimientos es ser un buen portador de buenas ideas hay deferente ejecutivos por ejenplo,el de ventas debe de ser claro con el cliente y tratar de vender tu producto que le estas ofreciendo ser conciso aclarle al cliente que el es <br>  el mas inportante en el lugar donde estes.y sobre todo se esta llevando un producto en bajo precio mas el descuento que le manejas  en ese instante..<br>  y alli  vas obteniendo la experincia deacuerdo a tu  forma<br>  vas formando tu personalidad..<br>  Eso es la base de un buen ejecutivo  su experiencia y <br>  en el trato de las personas donde estas trabajando..<br>  subes de nivel  cuando  trabajas para un banco es otro<br>  forma  de obtener experiencias por eso te decia que hay<br>  varios ejecutivos porque no es igual el  que elabora en el gobierno al banco e Industria son deferente  ok<br>  espero haberte ayudado  con tu duda<br>  y recuerda que el ejecutivos  se distingue por<br>  su personalidad  que unica en cada trabajo por sus<br>  experiencias laborales..<br>  atte<br>         frank valentino|`|ytC3eYSNaa	en sambors hay un libro que se llama  ejecutivo al minuto  es muy bueno, te sacara de dudas y te ensena a ser un verdadero ejecutivo. <br>  suerte
