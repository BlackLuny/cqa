6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo.  1? If you want a cartoon figure then go to http://avatars.yahoo.com and create or modify one and then go to part 3.  2? If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to put four pictures there by following the instructions. Mark the one you want to use as primary.  3? Now for either a cartoon or a picture save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or picture there to use.  BE SURE TO SAVE THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM.

I've gotten the same cycle of Best Answer notifications about 5 times now (the cycle is 12 notifications long). If you really want them to stop this, send up your spam filter on your email service to prevent them from sending them to you until Y!A fixes the problem, which is probably going to take a few days.    This is a glitch that Yahoo Answers is experiencing at this point in time, along with the contact question email notification and all you can do is wait.

44kCto9iaa	Phone verified leads are one of the best types of leads to acquire. Although at first you may not see instant results over time you will definitely see a consistent and long term amount of leads. Phone verified leads are also unique in the sense that the leads have already been informed with your offer before they go to your website. This method is called "Pre sell." It generally means that the visitors you will receive to your website through phone verification will be more likely to follow through with your offer because they have partially already been "Pre sold." Results may take some time as with ANY form of marketing but you will receive quality traffic quickly through Phone Verified leads.

Just play with them as you normally would.  Be sure to ask the parents what times the children are used to eating, when bath time is, when bedtime is.  Are there any special "tricks" that help either child eat better, sleep better, be more willing to take a bath without a lot of drama?  How much TV are they allowed to watch? Keeping them in there normal routine as much as possible it a very good thing.  Are either of the children taking any medications at the time?  Be sure to get a written and signed statement from the parents that your parents (specific names) are allowed to make medical decisions on their behalf should (God forbid) any kind of medical emergency happen.  But most importantly just have fun with them.  Play with them.  Read books with them.  Build a fort out of blankets and furniture with them.  If you have a backyard and weather permits, take them on a "field trip" and look for birds or bugs or flowers.  Just be your normal Fantastic Aunt and you'll do fine.|`|HGnKhY0maa	Ask there parents to bring some of there favorite things with them (toys, DVDs and games)  also find out all the kids channels on TV cant go wrong.|`|efZP71GWaa	GUIDE FOR BABYSITTERS <br>  <br>  When you babysit, you are entrusted with a child's life.

(40KB pdf) <br>  In the event of an emergency: Call 911: identify yourself by name, tell them you are babysitting and state the problem. State the address of the house where you are and the nearest cross street. (Be sure to specify north, South, Avenue, Street, etc.) Give the phone number you are calling from. <br>  Get written instructions about any medicines to be given to the children -- how much and what time. <br>  Having visitors while babysitting is a bad policy. Always get approval if you would like to have a visitor. <br>  Find out who you should call in case of an emergency. Be sure to get their phone number. <br>  Be sure to meet the family dog. <br>  Take a walk through the house and check for any special locks, windows that cannot be climbed out of, other telephones and anything all that would be a problem in case of an emergency. <br>  During the walk through, check for hazards and things that the children can get into, such as matches, lighter fluid, electric cords, plastic bags, medication, or anything else that may be dangerous. <br>  Look to see if there is a pool. Check for doggie doors and any unlocked doors or windows leading to that area. <br>  Have a mental fire drill: that is, plan on more ways than one to get yourself and the children out of the house in case of fire. <br>  Be sure to find out if you are to give the children anything to eat or drink before bed. <br>  Make sure all the doors and windows are locked from the inside, and lock the front door after the parents leave. <br>  WHAT TO DO AFTER THE PARENTS LEAVE <br>  If it is evening, turn on the porch/outside light. <br>  If the children are asleep, check on them about every 15 minutes. <br>  If the children are up, know their location at all times and never leave them alone too long. <br>  If for any reason you must leave the house, TAKE THE CHILDREN WITH YOU! <br>  DO NOT open the door for anyone unless you personally know the person. <br>  If someone insists on coming in and you do not recognize them, or if you suspect a prowler, CALL THE POLICE AT 911. <br>  IN CASE OF FIRE <br>  Sound the alarm -- yell FIRE as loud as possible. <br>  If possible, close the door to the area where the fire is. <br>  DO NOT attempt to extinguish the fire, but rather attempt to save a life. <br>  Get everyone out of the house, and do not go back in for any reason. <br>  Keep all the children together, and go to the approved neighbors's home. <br>  Call the Fire Department at 911 and leave the children with the neighbors, then go back outside to direct the fire fighters to the fire if you need to. <br>  A well-prepared babysitter will be highly respected and greatly appreciated by parents. Any sitter who takes these recommendations to heaBest Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  I was a counselor for 4 years....get online and find silly puddy and gak recipies.

fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	Congratulations on experiencing the most frustrating part of this website appealing a violation notice. <br>  <br>  Evidently, someone figured that your question is not really a question. And it was probably flagged by a Trusted User who has a high reputation for reporting. When you get flagged by a person with "a high level of trust" you have a lot of risk of this happening.<br>  <br>  To protect yourself, make your questions private and don't allow contacts. Because you may find yourself flagged by those who are on a path to get your profile suspended on here. I cannot tell you how many people I know in the R&S forum that end up getting the final violation notice over a question that was totally innocent like yours.<br>  <br>  There are yahoo purists out here who will flag your question or answer, just because they are misspelled, or are not in pure Q&A form. In other words, very nitpicky people who revere their trusted user status. <br>  <br>  It's a power trip for some and one reason that after getting level 7, I'm not on here more than a few minutes a month any more. I'm sick and tired of seeing people like yourself and many others get flagged, when they really are not doing anything wrong.<br>  <br>  Violation notice for insulting or harrassing? Yes! Violation notice because it is not a question that meets certain "let's bring up the quality of our website, but it's not insulting or harrassing, I just don't like the way it's worded" - for those who do...I wish they would realize how many people they frustrate on here.|`|MbFsbTPbaa	some y!a trolls delete questions, and it's freakin' annoying! ;/|`|uMWpBvxraa	Could it be the word "gorilla".Sometimes black people are called monkeys and gorillas.

BfmV2KpUaa	It's highly unlikely anyone would do that unless you were careless with your password. On most occasions, when people claim their accounts were hacked, it's because they were duped into giving their password away, or their password was easy to guess.<br>  <br>  Make it harder to crack a password by using a combination of letters, numerics and symbols, don't use a dictionary word. Don't give your password to anybody under any circumstance. Yahoo have no reason to ask for your password, so if you get any mail claiming to be from Yahoo that asks you to enter your account details at a given link, ignore it and delete it.<br>  <br>  If you're using a shared computer, make sure cookies are not saved, or delete cookies before logging out.|`|bEKVyHxCaa	Use a very good passwort and nobody will enter.

2Hl4AAP7aa	if the question has gone to voting you can vote no best answer on it and hope that it is the only vote. when you ask a question you can pick a best answer after 4 hours, if you are unhappy with the answers you get you can delete the question before it goes to vote and re-post it, it costs points but they are easy to get back.|`|lERouzRYaa	If you don't choose a Best Answer within 4 days, it automatically goes to a vote.

This feature is frequently glitchy (going missing, sharp reductions in numbers, resetting to zero, and etc.), thus it's notoriously unreliable. There really is nothing that you can do about it and Yahoo will not help you personally. This could be a temporary (most likely) or permanent problem. You can't reset or modify the feature yourself beyond setting permissions. Personally, I pretend the feature doesn't exist, but I did check and I have the same problem as you do.<br>  <br>  You can try refreshing your "Home" or "My Page". You can try clearing your browser's cache and cookies. I doubt either will work to help this problem though. It would have to "miraculously" be re-started by Yahoo.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it prepares to migrate parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet. <br>  - See blogs at <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360</a> for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response. <br>  - See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=858">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for more information on 360 glitches. <br>  - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1414">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1168">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1236">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> .|`|AUaJybxmaa	I think there's something wrong with your page, i usually have to post a comment three or four times before it will actually post :(|`|af80ba1389695bda01af19d60e5924deaa	Ahh - thought that was only happening to me!!

mzhFrm5Taa	You can't. There is no other way to get the account. As for contacting Microsoft, you mean the Hotmail people, yeah? Well, chances are you will never get a reply. They barely ever reply to people that e-mail them with problems, because it is a free e-mail service, they don't have to reply, they don't even have to read them because they don't get paid for it. 98% of the people that e-mail Microsoft/Hotmail do not get replies because of that so you'd need to be extremely lucky to get a reply. It's worth a shot, but it is a very, very, very long shot.<br>  <br>  This is why you should use paid e-mail services, there is no problems and you would get replies for everything you write to them among other benefits, it the account was for something important you should use a paid e-mail service but it doesn't sound as if yours was super important. There's not much you can do now.|`|NWvYLRPnaa	maybe u should make a new one and remeber the stuff this time.|`|P7me6hptaa	Guess

If you haven’t created your avatar, at the top of the page, under “Nickname” is a line that says “Use my 360 nickname”.

That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. Remember, it has to be in the JPG format, and it must be 5 MB or less. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile.

suPD7c3gaa	Research the name.  It could be this person has trademarked their name and has a legitimate request.  I work in the legal field with access to trademark attorneys, but neither of them are in today to ask.  Even the trademark paralegal isn't in today.  I would ask this question again in the Legal category.  It might just be someone who found the name you were using was taken.  They may have NO legal claim to the name at all, just want you to give it up... so they are trying scare tactics.  That's my suspicion.  But there are probably ways to check it out.

zviaJcoQaa	Short answer yes.<br>  <br>  pop3 (free), imap (kinda free), google and you can find the servers to point to.<br>  webmail (Can be accessed through Web)<br>  WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) is a protocol suite like TCP/IP.  You use something on top of it like a web browser.<br>  <br>  Pop3 and imap are protocols for mail.  webmail is accessed through a browser connecting to a server where the mail is held.  Does not matter if it has pop3 or imap.  There are browsers that run on WAP (A protocol suite for Wireless Devices).  and so yes you can read your webmail.<br>  <br>  You may want to look at wikipedia for a more detailed description of what I'm talking about.

It's ultimately how the RIAA was coming up with lawsuits against those file-sharing mp3's, for example.<br>  <br>  Via an IP address, they can themselves identify a service provider. Thereafter they contact the service provider to obtain records indicating who possessed that IP during the date and time in question. I believe they require a court order to force the ISP to research and share the information however. <br>  <br>  I would expect anyone who has just cause to be able to obtain the information necessary to trace you, though I'd expect some form of legal order would be required. If you were trying to hack into IBM, for example, and they had your IP on their records, they'd almost certainly be able to eventually find out it was you with that IP during the time period in question.

Photoshop costs a lot of money though, so unless you can buy it or you already have it, then I suggest downloading GIMP. It is exactly like Photoshop, only it's for free.

I swear, the man kept calling asking for my sister (because she was young and being naive was giving out our number to strangers), and the moment grandma blew the whistle, those calls ended immediately.  And it was LOUD!<br>  <br>  -- or you can try answering and putting them on hold, by putting the receiver next to some speakers that play some elevator music.|`|AA11758925	dont impersonate a police officer, notify them you are alerting the police department for harassing phone calls, this should scare em off cause it sounds like a lil kid doing it|`|TlihFR8Waa	"i also can't blow a whistle on them because i don't have one"<br>  what?|`|AA10241705	They're looking for a reaction, so anything you say or do will encourage them to keep calling. Answer the phone however you normally answer it, and if no one says anything, just stay completely silent. Put the phone down and walk away if you have to, but don't make any noise at all, or give them any kind of reaction. They WILL get bored and stop calling if you don't give them any kind of funny (to them) response. This has worked for me several times.

Either that, or use the Caller ID and don't pick up to Private Caller or Withheld or any of those. Or if you don't have caller ID pick up, and don't say anything AT ALL and play their own game.

suPD7c3gaa	Mail Carrier?  Are you referring to email?  If so, what do you mean by "type"?  Yahoo! mail, for instance, is a web-based email account.  Which means:  - that any emails stored are not taking up space on your hard drive  - that you can access your email from any computer at any location as long that computer has internet.  - that's it's generally free  - that you can change your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and not have to change your email address.    If it's your POP account, account provided by your ISP:    - you may be limited to where you can access that email from  - all emails stored are stored on your hard drive, thus taking up HD space.  - if you change your ISP, you give up that email address.    Those are a few guesses as to what you might be asking.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Link #1 explains how you can set up filters in Yahoo mail, the other 2 links give you additional info which might also be helpful.<br>  <br>  #1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.<br>  <br>  You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.<br>  <br>  Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/mail/spamguard1.html">http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...</a><br>  <br>  #2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails.

Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.<br>  <br>  Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.<br>  <br>  MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness. You can have email addressed to "undisclosed recipients" automatically deleted and bounced for example.<br>  <br>  Note: the program is free but limited to one email account. MW Pro supports multiple mail accounts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mailwasher.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mailwasher.net/</a>
suPD7c3gaa	Doing that is a clear violation of the Community Guidelines.  You can post a question with a link and just hope no one reports it.  If it's that important to you to find out what a bunch of perfect strangers think about you, then go for it.  Just remember that it is a violation and you're taking a chance.  There's no special way around taking that chance... no matter how you word it.

For example Flickr or Photobucket.<br>  <br>  There is no way to have an inline image directly from your computer in Yahoo mail on the web. It requires a separate email program.<br>  <br>  For IE go to the picture and right click on it and copy. Now go to the email body or signature and paste it.<br>  <br>  For Firefox it is a little trickier. Go to the picture in another window. You must be able to see the picture and the email window at the same time. Drag the picture to the email body or signature.<br>  <br>  The picture must remain on the web since a link is used and not the actual picture.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

zDQIPFH2aa	When this happens, there are two reasons:    1. (least likely) there is a random glitch now and then that just loses the Qs. YA Staff do not care, just delete the old version and reask. If it was a long question with links, ask it in a short version with no links, then finish the question with the links in the added details.    2. (more likely) you were caught by the prefilter. Exactly how it works is not known, but probably is based on keywords and links you use (to prevent spamming). These questions are held for the YA Staff to review. It is usually for hours during the week, but can be days on weekends and holidays. Again, if you follow the direction in  1 above, you can sometimes get around it.
iU4Q2GOdaa	honey, lots of people have nothing better to do in their lives but to take out their anger on random people online. maybe the way you answer makes you a target for these losers.

I call them stalkers.  You are not alone.|`|suPD7c3gaa	People don't flag or delete your questions.  Other Y!A users report your questions or answers and Yahoo removes them.  Thumbs down mean nothing.  And the fact that you wrong a 100 word answer, doesn't mean it was a good answer or that it didn't violate the Community Guidelines. No one can say why without knowing what the question was that was deleted.  And when it's an answer that as reported and deleted, we'd have to know what the question was that you were answering in order to be able to say why they were violations.

G4vFjh0yaa	It is far from a perfect system and there are many flaws in it. They do spend some time trying to correct it. But it clearly is not a priority.  When you ask a question like this you will find all the same people that copy and paste YA standards. That is nice in a perfect system but this isn't.  Are you getting a This Message Has Been Removed or Deleted?  Then an action has occured that is the result of trolls or the system itself which triggers on some words or collection there of.  Just move on and keep answering interesting questions that you can contribute to and avoid persons that know it all. YA doesn't and doesn't pretend to.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	There are several reason questions are removed:    1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.    2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.    3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.    4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.    If you answer you never get a notice unless you were the violation.  If the asker, look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.
WzusAmjYaa	you would probably need a greenscreen my friend, or a whole bunch of cutting and paisting.

That will be a layer. Then outline the legs and change the opacity to really low.  Then as you click on the body layer,  make a mirror of it, which will then be a new layer which you can lower the opacity, and erase any parts you dont want. <br>  Then make the writing etc, <br>  It's not just a ooh click and done to make a picture like that. you need to break it down into segments of<br>  background<br>  person<br>  mirrored image<br>  text,<br>  etc.

Khzi78ciaa	There are two places where you can change your name on Yahoo mail.    First is the name which appears in the "From" box when you send a mail and what people who receive the mail sees.    Second is the name in the account information which Yahoo has.    Common step for both -  Login to your yahoo mail account and click on "Options" > "Mail Options" on the top right hand side of the page.    Here is how to change first -  Once you follow the common step you will be taken to Mail Options page.  Here click on "General Preferences" under "Management". You will see general preferences page and in this page "Name and Email" preference. In the "From name:" box type the name you want to display and click on "Save" button.  Once you do this your name will be changed.    Here is how to change second -  Once you follow the common step you will be taken to Mail Options page.  Here click on "Account Information" on the left hand side of the page and re-enter your password. You will be taken to your account information page which yahoo has about you. You can see your Yahoo ID card too. Scroll down the page and click on "Edit" under "Address/Contact Information". You will be taken to another page wherein you can edit your information. In "Your Name" box type the name which you want Yahoo to have and click on "Finished" button. Again click on "Finished" button. Your name will be changed.    All the best!  |`|65e1b564d76980b1d0a8d6dcb9b68309aa	Sign into your yahoo account and change your user name.  You may have to supply your secret question and answer before they allow you to do that.
