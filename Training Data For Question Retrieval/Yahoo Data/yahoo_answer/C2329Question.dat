20090223162725AAXUrM3	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	I want to be a stay at home mom, and home school my girls.?	I’m a single mom of two little girls I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old. I want to start staying home with them and home schooling my 4 year old. I have very cheap rent for the neighborhood I live in; I’m living very basic I don’t need a lot of money to make ends meet. The reason why I’m posting this is to get some help on some ideas for making enough money to pay my expenses. I was once a mom that lived on government assistance from housing, medicade, food stamps and so on. I learned all I really needed to do was budget right and I could make it on my own with out the help of the government. I would love to stay off of the government help if all possible for me. I’m pretty open minded about certain jobs to do but I’m not going to sell my body or have 8 babies to pay my bill. So any suggestions to help me in this situation please feel free to share them with me.
20090223164136AAwOK6A	Education & Reference;Other - Education	What do you think of my paper?	It's a paper on why i want to write for this newspaper and when can i bring to the table, if there are any errors please correct thanks.         Writing for me is my escape from my problems. My writing is inspired from life and its problems. It didn’t happen in one sitting over night where I decided I wanted to write.  It all began at a young age of 11 years old when I grew a passion for writing. I began to write poetry, songs and short stories.  I knew right there and then I wanted to do something in writing.  My ultimate dream is to write for seventeen magazines.  However, starting small can lead to something big.  I am currently taking a journalism 1 class and I am   trying to learn to basics of writing.  I will be honest I am not the best at writing (it is very hard as you should know).  Though, my dedication is high and I will not stop. Sometimes when I kept getting redo’s or red marks all over my writing paper I got discouraged.  But, I never gave up I continued to keep trying.  My journalism teacher Ms.Sullivan calls me the good kid that doesn’t give up and keeps trying.  I could easily provide you guys with false information about myself.  In this case, I am not doing that I am just someone who is trying to chase my dreams. To me it’s not about being picked to write for something and brag. It’s something I want to accomplish and do in my life. Although, like I stated my writing isn’t the best I am willing to learn.  If I am picked to write for out loud I will bring to the tables hard work, determination and new ideas for the paper. My ideas can probably come from ideas from kids and what they want to know/read. Times may get rough yet I will continue to push. Even if I am not chosen to write for you guy hopefully you guys can choice me for something else.  If not, thanks for the opportunity and keep up the good work. Thanks

But according to my s.s. teacher a petition is not going to cut it. So I need research and examples from other schools who switched their days to start later and got good results like good grades, better test scores etc. Do you know of any schools that have done this that I could e-mail or contact? What about research sites that have done testing to prove that starting school later helps kids do better? Also how should I go about this "convincing" thing.

I am an 18 year old senior in high school. Usually a parent has to sign you out of school b4 one can leave the campus. I figured it should be fine for me to sign myself out since my parents are legally nothing to me (not guardians, etc.) but when I went to do so they said I could not. Can the school legally force me to have them sign me out? It doesn't make any sense to me since they have no legal rights over me, how can they be the ones that decide whether I can leave early? Please don't just say, "Yeah, the school's right." or "No, they can't do that." Support your reply w/ citing. Thanks.

I'm currently attending UCSD, but I've suddenly come to realize that I want to pursue a major in nursing. Problem being, there is no nursing major at UCSD.

I'm just afraid that I won't get into a good university with all the budget cuts and whatnot. However, I will save money with this route.      I mean, I kind of have come to like UCSD, so I'm a bit reluctant to leave.

However, there are a few other things I would like to do on top of that, that don't really relate.      I would like to work at an Embassy/Consulate. I think I would need to go into International Relations or Affairs, maybe Political Science. I could see myself working in Washington D.C. someday.      Alas, I would also like to teach abroad. That could mean teaching ESL, teaching at a Boarding or Private School in an dominantly English speaking country, or even teaching on Army base.      How could I make all of this work into either a double major, or a major and minor. Could I maybe get a double major in English and Writing, and a minor in International Affairs or Political Science? Should I just get a Masters in Teaching, since you dont even really need to go to college to work at an Embassy, and just try my luck.      What would your advice be? I am really stressed.

I'm 16 and next week I'm starting tutoring kids in 4th and 5th grade.  4th grade is when kids can join the orchestra in my town's school system.  So they need lots of help with intonation and stuff since they're beginners.  So I'm trying to get prepared because I've never taught or dealt with kids at all lol so I'm stocking up on stuff.  I already bought a really cool "finger finder pull out card" that gives all the hand shapes for each key signature I'm pretty excited to use that lol.   But I only have advanced music books.  Does anyone know of a book you would recommend me to start off the kids with?  There are too many out there I don't know what is best.  I'm looking for one that has catchy little songs in it and helpful with rhythm and things.  I don't mean the Suzuki books because even the 1st one I think would be too advanced for them so I'll move into those later.   I'm also looking for a scale book to use teaching - one that is easy to find a scale in whatever key the song is before we play the song   Also, what should I be looking for when I'm tutoring them? Posture..intonation..what else   I don't really know how to go about the tutoring..I guess I'll find my routine after a few lessons.   Sorry that's so much.. I'm kind of nervous I don't remember what my tutor used for me way back then lol

He than took it further and passed my emails to his Boss the principal. This made me embarrassed and feel violated on top of feeling bad he treated me differently now. She met with my husband ( couldn't go because my kids were sick)and she had all my emails on the table with certain sentences highlighted no less. I went on trial and he wasn't present for the meeting. By him saying I and my emails make him uncomfortable I felt like I was being accused of something. He wasn't accountable. Was it her place to get involved and question my motives?

20090222150110AAOYDfc	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Would Beowulf be considered wise or unwise?	I am supposed to compare this excerpt from "The Wanderer" to Beowulf.   “A Wise man must be patient, neither too passionate nor too hasty of speech, neither too irresolute nor too rash in battle, nor too anxious, too content, nor too grasping, and never too eager to boast before he knows himself.”   I think Beowulf was unwise in the beginning, but grew wiser after he fought grendel's mother and became a king.

Here's my situation.  Im a junior right now going to a pretty big university in OH.

I just want to transfer because I miss TX and want to go back (lived in Tomball).  However, I don't know if this is such a good idea from an economic standpoint as I would prob have to wait a year to establish residency in order to pay in-state tuition.  I assume all my credits will transfer as this college that I'm currently attending is a big accredited university and most other large universities generally accept credit transfers amongst each other.

20090222155411AAlyAr4	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Will I get in trouble for this at school?	Okay, this past friday, in gym class, there was a student teacher being supervised by our normal teacher, and we were in the weight room. He had a camera set up and was filming us and all the demonstrations he showed us. Me and my friend walked in front of the camera a couple time and made funny faces. Then when he was making a small demonstration, I purposely blocked the camera because i thought it would be funny. You could tell it was on purpose. It probably showed my head looking back to make sure I was blocking it, and my gym shirt with my name on it was most likely in full view. And before that I was like to my friend "yeah im gonna stand in front of the camera" which the camera probably picked up. I am in middle school.   A few questions: what was the student teacher using the camera for, and did my fooling around hinder something important he needed to watch. Also he probably filmed the other gym classes to, so would he just ignore the footage of my period and use the other classes, and also, WILL I GET IN ANY TROUBLE?

I want to study anthropology at a big school in an urban atmosphere.  I just looked at Ohio State and UW-Madison, and preferred UW because it was intertwined with the city, rather than OSU which had a definitive campus.  I'm also considering the University of Manchester in Britain because it has a lot of what I'm looking for.      But anyway, it seems that most city schools are private.  I'm a good student and could probably get into some top schools that I'd absolutely *love* (like NYU and the University of Chicago), but it's ridiculous to pay that much for a Bachelor's degree.  Boston and Providence have some great city schools, but they, too, are almost all private and really expensive.  I also live near there and really want to get away, without breaking the bank.      I'm also considering UCLA and the University of Washington in Seattle, but other than that, I can't really think of any other colleges to consider.  I don't want to go to the Eastern or Central South.  I wouldn't fit in there at ALL.

20090222141930AAzC45m	Education & Reference;Teaching	If you were a 9th grade history teacher, how bad would you say this is?	Give me a grade- I know this is bad and short, but I just couldn't think of anything.  The topic of the essay is "how are judaism, islam and christianity related?"  DO YOU THINK I GOT ABOUT A C+?  I doubt it, but what do you think:                     Three monotheistic religions, Judaism, Islamic, and Christianity are all very similar.  Judaism started around 2500 years ago.  Their religious text is called the Torah.  It was finished when the Jews were held captive in Babylon. Christianity started around 2000 years ago.  Their holy book is called the bible.  There is also the Islamic religion.  This religion started at around 1400 years ago.  Their religious book is called the Qur’an. Abraham was the founder of Judaism, Muhammad was the founder of Islam, and Jesus was the founder of Christianity.  Jews pray at a synagogue, Christians at a church and Muslims at a mosque.    Christianity, Judaism and Islam are all similar because they believe in ethical monotheism, they all have a sacred text, and Jerusalem is a holy place for all three religions.     One of these similarities is the fact that they all believe in ethical monotheism.  This means they believe in justice and good behavior, and also in only one god. Muslims believe that there is no god but god, and that Muhammad is his prophet.  Jews believe in only one god, and Christians believe in only one god, and their messiah is Jesus.       Another similarity is that they all have a sacred text: the Qur’an, the Torah and the Bible.  All three religions believe in the Old Testament.  Christians believe in the Old Testament which is in the Torah and the New Testament which is in the Bible.  Muslims believe in both of those, plus the Qur’an.       The third important similarity is that Jerusalem is important to the three religions.  For Jews, it is mentioned in the Torah.  Christians believe that Jesus was crucified there, and Muslims believe that Muhammad visited Jerusalem.        In conclusion, Judaism, Islam and Christianity are all very similar because they all believe in ethical monotheism, they all have a holy text, and Jerusalem is sacred to all three religions.

I have to write a narrative fictional essay of The Great Depression, however, I don't want to write about the Stock Market Crash, or the presidential election, I want to write about a teenagers experience of the time. I have chosen my main character to be a young teen, named Kate. I have done some research, but have not  gotten a lot of results. I want to story to center around the hardships that she experiences.    This is what I learned from my research:       -Black tuesday      -Roaring twenties      -"flappers"      -apple stands on the street corners      -men leaving home in search of jobs      -hobos/Hoovervilles      -bread lines/soup kitchens      I want part of it to be her comparing her present life to her former priveleged life, but I still need some research, and I am completely clueless as to what the events throughout the story will be, because it can't just be her sulking about being poor. So if you have any ideas as to what the events throughout this story should be, please answer! Also, if you happen to have lived through that time, please share your experience as a child or teen!

20090222140241AASCpHB	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Small Christian Liberal Arts School or Big University with Good Reputation?	So far, the colleges I am most interested in and that I feel happiest at are small, rural or suburban christian colleges. I really like the idea of going to a christian college, and not just one that is affiliated with a church and only calls itself christian. I want to go to one where the students really have a relationship with God. Also, I just like the atmosphere of the small liberal arts schools. I want that quintessential New England campus. and I am interested in working with a non profit organization after college. My favorite college is Gordon College in Wenham, MA.   The thing is, most christian colleges arent that selective, and guidance counselors and family members think that I should go to a bigger school with a better reputation. Gordan college, for example, has average sat scores a few hundred points below mine, and the GPA is a little bit below mine as well. I know that a colleges name is really useful in getting a job, so It might be pointless to go to a little school no one knows about. Also, being in a city is good for internships, and I will be in a rural area.   I know I could be happy in a lot of colleges, including some with bigger names, but I just like the ones like Gordon best.       So my question is:   Should I go to a school like Gordon, where I know I will be really happy and where they seem to have a good christian community, even if it doesnt have much of a reputation and it is easy to get into,   Or should I listen to parents and guidance counselors and go to a bigger school with more of a reputation and better fits my grades and scores.

20090222124031AAuPm0O	Education & Reference;Special Education	21 month old with PDD and eating?	My son was diagnosed with PDD about 2 months ago, however I have had a feeling he was autism spectrum since he was about 8 months old. Eating is his greatest challenge. He doesn't feed himself anything but Kraft American cheese and Gerber puffs but at one time he did allow me to feed him chopped up table food on a spoon. Noodles, french toast, shredded meat, mashed up meatballs, etc. When he turned about 14 months he started throwing up everything and anything and I had to revert back to stage 3 baby food. He then started throwing that up and I started on stage 2 baby food. Right now his diet is: Kraft cheese and puffs (as previously mentioned), Gerber baby oatmeal or rice cereal mixed with milk, applesauce, Handisnack banana pudding, stage 2 meats, Yo baby yogurt, Betty crocker mashed potatoes, and stage 3 Gerber dinners. Still, every once in awhile, he gags and throws up on his staples. I never know what to expect. He does receive therapy through early intervention 3 times per week, 2 times are for feeding OT. He is not responding to feeding OT at all and is making zero progress. He's dipped in the growth charts so his doctor prescribed a high calorie formula that is basically keeping him from wasting away. I don't want him to be dependent on this forever, but I know this is issue is common with autistics. What else can I try? Forget pureeing table food, he throws up on any texture that isn't Gerber's.

I participate in soccer and lacrosse for my school and I am in the honor society and the spanish honor society. I tell myself all the time that I am going to study for all my tests and quizzes, practice for my SATs, maintain an A average, and participate in extra curricular activities. I am also going to do the IB program. I have some questions.   1. How can I stand out? If I can't be the smartest person in my grade, what can show that I am special?   2. How important are the SATs? What is the most important thing?   Anything else you would like to add would be appreciated. Thanks. =)

What must I do in order to attend ASU and graduate successfully? I need a plan, but the thing is, I don't know how to generate this plan seeing as to how I've never been to a University before. Here are the key details to my situation:      -I'm an 18 year old male   -I dropped out of high school in 11th grade   -I do have my G.E.D.   -I attended my local community college (MSCC) for about two and a half months, paid for by financial aid and an academic scholarship (high G.E.D. and COMPASS scores) however, I never withdrawed and just stop going, so no achievements there.   -I'm on academic probation   -I owe $700 to financial aid (balanced that wasn't earned or something like that)   -I live on my own (with my girlfriend)   -I'm a cashier at Walmart   -I make about $700 per month   -I have no money saved   -I have no parental assistance      Basically, I don't have an education to show for except my G.E.D. not that I'm lacking in intelligence, and I'm barely making it living on my own without going to school. What I'm wanting to do is move to Arizona and attend and reside at Arizona State University. My girlfriend will be finished with her first two years of school (her basics) this December. Therefore we are both wanting to transfer to ASU. (she's originally from Arizona)      What do I need to do to get out of here and into ASU?

I have looked into the qualification you get on this course (level 2) and it is awarded by the Open College Network, does anyone know if this is any use to an employer if I went for an interview? When jobs have been advertised they all require NVQ's. As I won't be working while I study I am planning to do some volunteer work to gain some experience. If anyone has any Idea's please let me know as I don't want to pay for a course that's not going to get me a job at the end if it!!      Many thanks      Kerry
20090222142637AArjRJW	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Freshman year of High School?	I'm a freshman at High School and I'm worried about my GPA.. In my first semester, my GPA was a 3.58(89.5), this semester it is around a 3.76(94). I'm taking all honors and I'm involved in a couple of clubs(debate and robotics), sports(tennis and golf) and I'm also taking part in a research internship. How will this effect me in terms of college admissions. I hope to go to a good university(unsure of my career path), but how is the upward trend in one's GPA compared, to a constant one(such as 4.0 all four years)? Any advice for the future would also be very helpful.   Thanks
