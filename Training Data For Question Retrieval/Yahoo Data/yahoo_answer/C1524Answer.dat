hvIrXa9Gaa	If you're fluent, you can communicate easily with another person who speaks the language, understand slang and sayings in the language, be able to follow people when they are speaking the language, etc. etc. etc. You are definitely fluent in English, I can tell from how nicely your question is written.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|OilzDxs2aa	Interesting question, but unfortunately this question will always stay in debate. There are too many opinions on what standards are required to accomplish complete fluency in a language and it is kind of impossible to determine what absolute fluency is. I guess you just have to be able to speak without stuttering and making mistakes: as it says, you have to literally speak fluently.|`|yyHybME0aa	Fluent means you must able to speak or write smoothly, easily, or readily.  If English is what you where taught while living with the rest of us Americans, then just like us, you are fluent in English.  Although, there are some people who can be taught to become fluent in other languages.|`|m4nKkFDUaa	If you can understand people, talk to people and have them understand you, read books, understand TV, and generally communicate in the language effectively, you're fluent.|`|jfCxifaEaa	yes you are fluent in English.|`|N2p30Mo4aa	You're fluent, I understood your question :)|`|AA12159255	In your case, you're a native English speaker (which technically means you understand everything in English). but you could learn another language, such as Spanish, and eventually master it so that you can read, write, speak, and understand spanish. that would make you fluent in spanish, just not a spanish-born speaker.|`|CoRQztUZaa	An aside: A lot of people talk about thinking in a given language. I have several friends who remember when they stopped thinking in their native language and started thinking in English. Although this isn't the same as fluency, I'd say the two are probably closely related.
CB9a6q9Waa	If you have to get baptized multiple times, doesn't that mean it doesn't do anything but get you wet? No female pun intended. My sister got baptized twice, sure as hell didn't work on her.|`|vJxuWyueaa	You don't need baptized again. Churches that say that homosexuality is wrong only added those rules in their churches because the creators of the rules were homophobic.|`|nURoPCPzaa	Gay sex is not wrong.  You'll be fine.  No need to be baptized again.|`|FVxYIuP4aa	You're a troll aren't you?? *gets out can of troll-be-gone* You only need to be baptized once....|`|lvF5Tpniaa	I was baptized and had gay sex and I turned out just fine... Don't be so hard on yourself. You are only living in your natural state.|`|P2kL3apWaa	Oh please.  You don't need to be baptized again.  You need a gay friendly therapist to help you sort through your faith and orientation.
vidqITjwaa	What's more important? <br>  An nondescript embryo or a living breathing human being with Alzheimer's, MS or cancer?|`|AA11690436	You don't have to dig into scripture to prove that point.  Don't one in three pregnancies result in a miscarriage?  Obviously, those miscarrying mommies must be grievous sinners, or else God just doesn't like about a third of the fetuses he "ensouls".|`|aCDWwsisaa	Between 1 in 5 and 1 in 8 pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion ("miscarriage"), so I'm guessing that either the Lord has no big problem with it, has no control over it, or isn't actually there!|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	An embryo is not a person.

Puzzling.  You even used their language of caps lock.  This is very disturbing.|`|b7d3fe1e0770cd80916e81d846475327aa	Um...  yeah.  Whatever.  Thanks for the self-serving, misogynistic bible lesson.

J0bAlEt6aa	First of all, <br>  <br>  Size does matter. <br>  <br>  She will only ever compare you if your penis is really small which you say it isn't so your good. ;-)|`|CB9a6q9Waa	I wouldn't exactly call it comparing, unless she's  blown a guy before or been penetrated already. ALot of times they only compare sizes because of what their experienced friends tell them.|`|JsiELu6xaa	she will probably compare the two. you shouldn't worry though because most women don't really care. But you should realize that its not up to us men to say "size doesn't matter", as that is something that is really up to the female population to decide. That is excluding the gay group. but I don't really think they apply to this question.|`|Nnk2tdDSaa	yes they do and while she's doing you she will be laughing on the inside saying how much smaller you are to him|`|qlqxDGBHaa	I do, and it's a shame that more girls don't.<br>  <br>  Size really doesn't matter. It comes in third or even fourth place in the hierarchy of important things for sex. <br>  <br>  Sex won't be pleasurable at all unless there is chemistry - you both have to be hot for one another. Also, sex will be more meaningful and thus more pleasurable (not just physically so) if you love each other, and even MORE so, if you are married. Technique is where it is at - every two people are shaped and sized differently and need to figure out what works for their specific match <br>  <br>  So, there's Love/attraction/Chemistry, then Technique/Ability, then MAYBE size, but usually not. If a woman can pleasure herself with just a finger or two, the size of the penis doesn't have to be that big at all. Besides, it's not all about penetration anyway. <br>  <br>  Guys, trust me, whatever size penis you have, it is fine. Girls, if you are displeased with the sex you're having with a man, it may not be because of the size of his member. <br>  <br>  Have a nice day, and thanks for this question!

EmOnt7FIaa	Chris Brown didn't do anything wrong.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	The situation itself sends a negative message to young men everywhere because it suggests that violence against women is totally acceptable and easily forgivable.|`|PvPPivLJaa	Rihanna sent the worst message by getting back with him. I'm really disgusted with her. And that message is the message that is also being sent to men who feel that even if they beat their women black and blue, they'll come back to them like nothing happened. <br>  <br>  At first I hated Chris Brown, but now i'm through with Rihanna. If she took him back, she must like it.  Chris Brown is who he is - an immature little boy who likes to punch people when he gets mad. Rihanna is condoning that behavior.|`|sIqXCXoVaa	*punches you in the face*<br>  OMG SO THUG XD|`|EJAvOHxGaa	I think so.|`|DeuKCARsaa	im sure you heard nothing of the sort.<br>  <br>  and whats up with the parentheses...<br>  <br>  by now we KNOW who you hate!|`|WBf2V8vSaa	What happened between them is their business. Physical violence happens everyday, and how many times have you actually seen two people that aren't famous on the news or in the media because of it? I have never seen any. Just because they are famous, doesn't mean they deserve to have cameras shoved in their faces all of the time, and have people all in their business. I know they are role models to many but they are people just like you and me. My point is just because Rhianna may have been a victim of physical abuse, she isn't the only one out there. Just because she has an amazing voice it, doesn't set her apart from the rest of the women being physically abused. Its just like one of the jonas brothers, he is a diabetic and everyone was like "support jonas". Again he isn't the only one that has diabetes and he shouldn't be set out of the rest just because he is famous. It is not like Rhianna or Jonas are the only ones that have either been physically abused or have diabetes.|`|eskZfVBkaa	There are going to be ignorant people laughing at what happened. Race has nothing to do with it. if anything , he is sending a negative message to boys in general, not just black boys.|`|yS9a9jk5aa	He sent a negative message to all.

q7z7Ni3Daa	It is both. Spelt is older, and spelled is newer.<br>  <br>  Compare it to dreamt and dreamed. Dreamt is older, and dreamed is newer. Yet, they are both correct.<br>  <br>  Language is constantly changing, so there are often two correct forms for some words while the change is happening. Usually the change moves from an irregular form to a regular form, like in these two examples. The more common the word, the slower it is to change. For example, slept is still used almost exclusively. Almost no one says sleeped......yet. =)|`|RLQPWkXCaa	Spelt is the older form of the past tense. It's more often used by British English speakers.|`|XozfdObQaa	Spelt is the British form, and spelled is the American form. It's less common today than it was previously, but it's still appropriate.<br>  <br>  Just as British English users spell words colour, favourite, flavour, etc. (with the U in them) as opposed to Americans using color, favorite, flavor, etc.<br>  <br>  Other words are similar...smelt (smelled), learnt (learned), spilt (spilled), etc.|`|Z62ubvpYaa	spelt is the past tense, and yes it is word|`|oIJGqOC2aa	I don't think spelt is a word...

Some women try to get other's attention by that.  In that case, I will shut my mouth.  Else, I will let her know, or ask some other lady -- if I am a man -- to do it for me.|`|hoOBUTWxaa	don't tell her yourself, but get another girl, preferably someone she likes to tell her in the hallway or something|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I would be very uncomfortable if a man told me, but maybe if you can arrange for another woman to let her know.  That's assuming she just needs to pull her slacks up a bit or something.  If they're just showing through and there's nothing she can do to easily fix it, leave it alone.  She likely already knows.|`|AA11593971	If the woman is wearing something so short that it is possible for her underwear to show, she probably doesn't care.|`|WuhIoS1laa	Probably ignore it. <br>  <br>  If we're talking about a panty-line, and you are not a friend, don't. There is nothing she can do about it now. <br>  <br>  If it's a case of her underwear peeking above the waist of her skirt or pants, I still wouldn't say anything. So many people male and female seem to think this is a fashion statement. <br>  <br>  Some fashions involve a partially translucent top and a bra, somewhat visible beneath. Again - ignore.<br>  <br>  Undie appearance due to unintentional damage or zipper issues, by all means - let them know discretely.|`|nRFZwdN4aa	If I'm a guy, I wouldn't say anything. <br>  <br>  If I'm a woman, I would tell her. <br>  <br>  However, if you are a true gentleman and don't mind risking her impression of you (as someone who looks at her waist to notice), then say "Your....." and point, but with your body angled away from her and make eye-contact only very brief.  As soon as she gets your drift, smile quickly and nod, then leave.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Yes, but I would have enough class to ask her to the side then let her know. If it's beyond obvious like a black bra under white top- she knew before she left the house. It also depends on how old the woman was. An older woman- absolutely. A teenager- she probably knows anyway.|`|yxpLkTNhaa	tell her. wouldnt you want someone to tell you?

BUT if everyone has health care, the quality won't be so good
GEIuZ2ivaa	Your husband shouldn't have called you "stupid" for suggesting that. That's a bit harsh. He could've just politely disagreed with you.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I would not have given up the table. As your husband said, you were there first. If the couple had a problem with it, they should have taken it up with the hostess who promised them a seat by the window and then did not seat them there. You were sat where the hostess led you to, you are not at fault for doing anything wrong. Some people (especially some older ones) are just bitter and need to complain. Instead of letting it ruin your meal, take comfort in the fact that when you are their age, you will not allow something as small as a table to ruin your mood. I'd be willing to bet the man complains about a lot of things in his life.|`|9q2RmVHRaa	It was best that you ignored them.  You shouldn't stoop to their level. Hopefully when they get home he realizes what a jerk he has been.|`|AA11780840	Been there!!! But on the opposite end meaning we were up called by the hostess first and then another couple was called. My partner is hispanic and I am caucasion. We were walking behind the hostess and there were two tables one was booth and by the window and the was just a table with two chairs and she started to seat us at the table with the chairs and told the other couple (both white) to take the booth. Oh hell no. I said no we were here first and we want the booth and window seat. The hostess looked at me embarrassed and sort of got a little pissy and said fine... We took the booth.. but she made it even worse and took the other couple and sat them at another booth by the window instead of just sitting them where we were suppose to seated.. What an ******?<br>  I don't understand why people think they are so priviledged... Your husband was right for standing his ground. Neither one of you OWE the other couple any explanations. It was wrong for the couple to get the manager and waitress involved. The guy seem like he should get some special treatment... If he really wanted a window seat. He could have waited a few more minutes more for one to come available... It was stupid to give an ugly stare... it was not your fault... and shame on him in trying to ruin your breakfast. You are a paynig customer and should be treated just the same as anyone else in the room. If anything you guys should have complained and told the manager that you were not feeling comfortable because the mean old man is staring at you and making it very difficult for you to enjoy your meal. I am with hubby ignoring them was the best idea this was his issue not yours.. <br>  Edit: I just remembered my partner was telling me it is ok don't worry about we can just stay here at the table and chairs.. I am like no I am not letting the hostess off the hook... besides I want the booth more comfortable... My partner did not want to make a scene but I am not going to let some one be discourteous like that it is not right AT ALL and if no one says something the hostess will do the same damn thing to the next interracial couple..<br>  <br>  Take care...|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Honestly, there's not much you can do but give a sympathetic smile and then just ignore their little tirade.  They've obviously gotten spoiled in the past and feel like they always deserve a window seat.  Cracker Barrel and other chain restaurants will normally seat you where you like if there's room, but not on a busy morning like that...you get what you get.  Cracker Barrel, just so you know, has a reputation of racial discrimination that they're trying to overcome, so they were wise not to treat you any differently than anyone else.|`|u4liwDhAaa	First off, I agree with Tiff, your husband shouldn't have called you stupid.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it never ceases to amaze me how rude people can be!  You didn't do anything wrong.   The rude person was that guy.  I wonder if he thought that by making a scene it would get him your table?

Shame on them!<br>  <br>  I certainly hope your next Sunday morning is a lot brighter!|`|WuhIoS1laa	You know, I guess i can be a little oblivious to the world sometimes, but in your situation I would not have immediately made the connection that the seats you were given were meant for the other couple either. <br>  <br>  I am not inclined to reward poor behavior like that. They were being elder-brats. But it was entirely up to you to offer to move or not. <br>  <br>  I'm assuming that there are other window seats besides the one!  The time to say something would have been politely, with out the glaring, to the server before you'd gotten settled. <br>  <br>  The manager could have easily done something to smooth this over by offering the other couple a free entree, voucher for another visit, or offering the same to you if you'd be willing to switch.<br>  <br>  My husband (who is white) and I don't mind swapping seats if someone asks us nicely. The temper tantrum would not have gone over well though. <br>  <br>  Perhaps it's not too late for the gentleman to learn a little etiquette.|`|nRFZwdN4aa	Judging by the rudeness of the couple who took the table across from you and glared, rather than just politely saying, "Sorry, but I think you were given the seat the hostess meant for us".....I would just keep the darn table and ignore them like your husband did. The couple's behavior was rude and out of proportion to the perceived offense.|`|rfYvOuN2aa	hmm that would be annoying since you didn't ask for that table but sometimes the hostesses are dense and talking to much and not paying attention to what they are doing.  that couple shouldn't have been rude to you and i don't know if it was due to race or not but they shouldn't have been mad at you for it and should have complained to the hostess for not giving them what they asked.|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	If they are regulars there, something tells me they have been difficult in the past. My guess is they feel they have some right to a certain seat. They could have waited till you two were done eating!. I would of said sorry to your waitress and left it at that. Its the other couples hang up. By giving in to people like that, they will always think that complaining and demanding works. I would have ignored them, too, but I certainly would not called you stupid!

pB55nws3aa	I'm very sorry to hear all of this...I think it might be a possibility that there may be treatments for people who want to have sexual attraction to one of or both genders, but then that would also mean that's its possible to make gay people straight and vice-versa ...If I were you, I would google "asexuality" and "asexuality treatment" to see if there really is something out there that may get you what you want, but I have no personal knowledge of such a thing.|`|P2kL3apWaa	This is something you need to discuss with your therapist.<br>  <br>  Being asexual doesn't mean you have to go through life alone.

I mean thin, thick, fat, ugly, beautiful. Take notes. Go to your library and find sex-ed books, wikipedia it. Everyone has to pull weight on their attractions. If anything, all this work will keep your mind off suicide. Don't end up like me after I was suicidal. Trust me, you don't want to go through it. You'll gain experience and intellect, but it'll be painful and costly, and it can be learned without suicide is the worst part.|`|JsiELu6xaa	man chill out. don't kill yourself. Your probably not really asexual. that is really rare. So you haven't felt sexually attracted to any person at all in life? Like you have never looked at porn and enjoyed it or had a single sexual though about any single person in your entire life? NEVER? I have a really hard time believing that. But If it is true then I only have one other explanation other than asexuality that could work. Are you afraid of sex? Is THAT why you are not thinking about it? If you are just don't worry about it, and let it happen. If you really aren't afraid of it then you may just need to explore your sexuality a little more. And if you really do happen to be asexual, then you should be happy. I mean you shouldn't feel bad about not having a sexual relationship if you have absolutely no desire to have a sexual relationship. that's just how god made you. But if you do have a desire to have a relationship then you are not Asexual but you have some sexuality that you are either denying or just unfamiliar with. You should relax and just think about yourself.|`|8i9Ji3QQaa	if sex doesnt help,<br>  see someone. a psychiatrist|`|LSCvCyeVaa	take it easy and go talk to someone

Yb9E25Uraa	The first step in understanding this verse is to examine the word freedom, and try to understand how it has been used historically versus how we normally use the word now.  These days, we see freedom as not being subjected to something, as in freedom from oppression, etc.  This definition of freedom supposes that we can only be ourselves when no one else has a claim on us, insofar as they cannot prohibit our actions and we are then free to do as we choose.  The reason for our modern definition is that we belong only to ourselves and to no one else.<br>  <br>  The older definition of freedom parts from this concept in one major area: instead of freedom from constraints, it is a freedom for excellence.  While it still incorporates the idea of not having external constraints which would prevent us from doing what we choose, it adds in the concept of an unconditional Authority, an unconditional Good - one that we ought to choose whenever we are able.  This definition of freedom stems from a belief that we are not our own; rather, we belong to God.<br>  <br>  This freedom for excellence requires that we know what that unconditional Good is, and what it requires of us.  In this case, the precepts of God (the unstated Good in this passage) are those signposts along the road, if you will, that allow the author to declare that he now possesses true freedom.  This knowledge of truth informs (our minds) and conforms (our wills) and allows us to seek the Author of Truth.<br>  <br>  In short, the freedom of which David speaks is completely free of the modern mindset (I belong to me), and reflects theological implications much deeper than the one verse offers at face value (I am beloved's, and my beloved is mine).|`|0lpXN8p9aa	God has given Life and It is Peace by nature. All that binds does not come from God but from mind..... God "IS" Love and sharing is It's precept....Peace and Blessings.....

I guess that's because I have met many Arabs and I have studied Arabic.  What I have discovered is that there is not one Arab accent.  It just depends on the persons voice and what country they are from.<br>  <br>  Many people (in the US) can't distinguish an Arab from many other people including Pakistanis, Iranians, Indians, etc.  They have no idea what Arabs sound like or look like.  I think many would label people from Pakistan to be Arab, but then at the same time, they'd think that Arabs were Europeans at times...So it's hard to really say what people would think about Arabs because do they even know who Arabs are?|`|jfCxifaEaa	it does nothing for me but definatley not smart, sexy

Other answers and opinions offered to you reflect God related emotions when they attempt to explain love and examples of love. In the absence of God you find only evil and evil disguises itself as hate. It also masquerades as greed, jealousy, avarice and sloth to name only a few. A world without love would be a world without God and with out God we would have evil disguised as hate. We will never experience that because God has promised to never leave us nor to forsake us. We will never loose life, so a loss of life attributed to war is only the fate of the unbeliever. I believe in the forgiveness of sin, the resurrection of the body and that life is everlasting.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	You are talking about the yin yang  or the double sided coin....love/hate, no love/no hate . . .

AA11440601	Catholics believe that from the moment of conception until natural death, each human being is endowed by God with dignity and rights. Therefore abortion is viewed as the murder of an innocent and defenseless human being.<br>  <br>  You shall not kill. (Ex 20:13; cf. Deut 5:17)<br>  <br>  Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you. (Jer 1:5; cf. Job 10:8-12; Ps 22:10-11)<br>  <br>  My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately wrought in the depths of the earth. (Ps 139:15)<br>  <br>  Early Church writings: You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish. (Didache 2, 2: SCh 248, 148; cf. Ep. Barnabae 19, 5: PG 2, 777; Ad Diognetum 5, 6: PG 2, 1173; Tertullian, Apol. 9: PL 1, 319-320)<br>  <br>  And finally:<br>  <br>  "A person's a person, no matter how small!" -- Dr. Seuss, "Horton Hears a Who"<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 2270 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml#2270" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|NCRfZRopaa	It depends on what they think of it.

Do you abandon ALL your principles when push comes to shove?<br>  <br>  Sounds like "situational ethics"  - you change your ethics to suit the situation. -- SCAREY!<br>  <br>  Christian perspective --<br>  <br>  All human life comes from God. He created it for a reason.  It is not our place to play God and decide who lives and who dies. We don't know EXACTLY when  group of cells become a human with a soul, therefore taking ANY deliberate action against it,  falsely assumes we KNOW and can make that determination, or even have the RIGHT to make that determination. <br>  <br>  At the very least.. abortion requires Society to draw a line and pretend like we KNOW for sure when an embryo of fetus BECOMES a human.  <br>  <br>  Pro-lifers simply, and honestly say,  We don't know.. so LEAVE IT ALONE. <br>  <br>  All that the Pro-life movement requires, Christian or NON-christian is to simply RESPECT human life and NOT do anything artificially to destroy it.  Let nature take its course. <br>  <br>  THAT'S ALL<br>  <br>  It's about being honest.. knowing our place...admitting what we know and what we don't know.  Not being arrogant and claiming we KNOW for sure. <br>  It's about merely letting nature take its course,  if the baby dies before its born.. so be it.  <br>  It's about not assuming that a young girl, or a college women, won't love the baby, just because it wasn't planned for. <br>  It's about not assuming that just because someone was sexaully abused that they will take that out on their baby and abuse it....giving the mother the benefit of the doubt. <br>  It's about NOT CREATING a RIGHT and then turning around the justifying the decision. <br>  It's about NOT passing laws protecting the right, until we as society has discussed and come to a consensus over the MANY issues surrounding aboriton. <br>  <br>  You see the WAY abortion rights were given was by group of judges deciding for the entire nation, a very controversial issues based on just 1 case.  They didn't consider rape,  they didn't consider under-age children being victims of sexual abuse, they didn't consider over-population, they didn't consider adoption, or foster care, etc. <br>  ALL those arguments have been made AFTER it was made a federal RIGHT.  The judges created the law..and THEN left society to figure out the ramifications.  It didn't put limits on it.  It didn't use science to make the determination (in fact the official judgement stated that science COULDN'T answer the question of when life begins back in the 70s)<br>  <br>  So MANY people think the abortion laws were not well thought thru and didn't allow society to discuss it.  1 Case decided the fate of millions of babies in the United States. -- That doesn't sound fair.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	That depends on the Christian. There are pro-choice Christians too.

Their beliefs are as follows:<br>  <br>  Roman Catholics - no abortion should ever be allowed, as life is given at conception, and God knows every person from the moment they are conceived, so abortion is murder.<br>  <br>  Church of England - Abortion is an evil, but sometimes the lesser evil.  This basically means that abortion should be avoided, but if, for example, you were raped so had a child, you could say that abortion was the lesser of the two evils. Also, if your unborn child is severely disabled, this can count as the greater of two evils.<br>  <br>  Methodist - Basically the same as Church of England, if abortion is the lesser of two evils, it is acceptable.<br>  <br>  Some Christians say that miscarriage is God's way of performing an abortion, as He knows that it is not an evil in the case of that child.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, and believe in the CofE view, so this is from a Christian.  Hope this helps!|`|BzrUWCsDaa	They should disagree with it as God's word says it is wrong<br>  <br>  A life is precious to God as soon as it is conceived.<br>  Psalm 139:16<br>  <br>  Also read Exodus 21:22-25<br>  "And in case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices. 23?But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul, 24?eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25?branding for branding, wound for wound, blow for blow"<br>  <br>  This shows that God views the unborn child as important because its saying that if the child comes out & lives, the offender should have damages imposed upon him but if the child comes out & dies then the offender should pay with his own life|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	Seeings as it's a sin to murder, any christian who truly understood what abortion was would be against it.

It will also pay for accommodations needed to be successful.|`|WjRqYf6naa	A lot depends on where you live, as Vocational Rehab is a state program. Social Security does have some transitional benefits, though, such as the trial work period.<br>  <br>  <br>  "During a trial work period, a beneficiary receiving Social Security disability benefits may test his or her ability to work and still be considered disabled. We do not consider services performed during the trial work period as showing that the disability has ended until services have been performed in at least 9 months (not necessarily consecutive) in a rolling 60-month period. In 2008, any month in which earnings exceed $670 is considered a month of services for an individual's trial work period. In 2009, this monthly amount increases to $700."<br>  <br>    <br>  SSI work incentives at a glance<br>  <br>  Continuation of SSI—SSI -payments are made to people age 65, blind or disabled and have little income or resources. If you are disabled and work despite your disability, you may continue to receive payments until your earnings, added with any other income, exceed the SSI income -limits. This limit is different in every state. Even if your SSI payments stop, your Medicaid coverage usually will continue if your earnings are less than your state level.<br>  <br>  Expedited reinstatement—If we stopped your payments because of your earnings and you become unable to work again because of your medical condition, you may ask us to start your payments again. You will not have to file a new -disability application if you make this request within five years after the month your benefits stopped.<br>  <br>  Work expenses related to your disability—If you work, you may have to pay for certain items and services that people without -disabilities do not pay for. For example, because of your medical condition, you may need to take a taxi to work, instead of public transportation. We may be able to deduct the cost of the taxi from your monthly earnings before we determine if you are still eligible for benefits.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Well you should have counselor who would pay you for class and send someone to be with you to find a job so fast.

There are some slight differences in prayers here and there. The Catholic Church also canonizes saints, and I don't think that any of the Protestant churches have them at all (the Eastern Orthodox churches do, but they came about long before Protestantism and Martin Luther and John Calvin and all that jazz). Protestant clergy usually can get married and some have women ministers. Catholicism only ordains celibate male priests.<br>  As for "strictness", it is not necessarily true that the Catholic church is more stern than Protestant ones. Sects like Puritanism came about because they thought that traditional Anglicanism was becoming too flashy and fancy and not strict enough. As you must know, those Puritans sure were fun. On the other side, late Protestant groups such as the Unitarians are very liberal with their interpretation of the Bible (some are even skeptical about the Virgin birth) - they're more about unity and community rather than judging who goes to Heaven/Hell.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	The Catholics are the original Christians.  They follow what was taught by the apostles and what has been believed by Christians from the Start.  The Protestants broke away from the Catholics and rejected some core beliefs of Christianity like transubstantiation, perpetual virginity of Mary, veneration of saints.  They also introduced new non-Biblical and heretical doctrines like sola scriptura, rapture, and once saved always saved (OSAS).<br>  <br>  Edit:  To Chris,<br>  The Christians in the Book of Acts were Catholic.  St. Luke, who wrote the Book of Acts and one of the canonized Gospels was Catholic.  All the New Testament books were written by Catholics.  The Catholic Church compiled and canonized the Bible.  Your lies will not change the truth that the Catholic Church is the first and true Christian Church.|`|jard50Yiaa	The Roman Catholic Church, officially known as the Catholic Church is the world's largest Christian church, representing over half of all Christians and one-sixth of the world's population. The Catholic Church is a communion of 23 sui juris particular churches. Among these are the Western Rite (Latin Rite) and Eastern Catholic Churches comprising 2,782 dioceses. The Church's highest earthly authority in matters of faith, morality and Church governance is the pope, currently Benedict XVI who holds supreme authority over the Church in concert with the College of Bishops, of which he is the head. The community is made up of an ordained ministry and the laity; members of either group may belong to organized religious communities.<br>  <br>  The Church defines its mission as spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ, administering the sacraments and exercising charity. It operates social programs and institutions throughout the world, including schools, universities, hospitals, missions and shelters, as well as organizations such as Catholic Relief Services, Caritas Internationalis and Catholic Charities that help the poor, families, the elderly and the sick.<br>  <br>  Through apostolic succession, the Church believes itself to be the continuation of the Christian community founded by Jesus in his consecration of Saint Peter, a view shared by many historians. It has defined its doctrines through various ecumenical councils, following the example set by the first Apostles in the Council of Jerusalem. On the basis of promises made by Jesus to his apostles, described in the Gospels, the Church believes that it is guided by the Holy Spirit and so protected from falling into doctrinal error.<br>  <br>  Catholic beliefs are based on the Bible and on traditions handed down from the time of the Apostles, which are interpreted by a teaching authority. Those beliefs are summarized in the Nicene Creed and formally detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Formal Catholic worship, termed the liturgy, is regulated by Church authority. The Eucharist, one of seven Church sacraments and the key part of every Catholic Mass or Eastern Catholic Divine Liturgy, is the center of Catholic worship.<br>  <br>  With a history spanning almost two thousand years, the Church is one of the world's oldest institutions, and has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilization since at least the 4th century. In the 11th century, a major split (the Great Schism) occurred between Eastern and Western Christianity, largely as a result of disagreements over papal primacy. The Eastern Orthodox churches became a separate entity from the Catholic Church in the resulting schism. Eastern Churches who remained in or later re-established communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, form the Eastern Catholic churches. In the 16th century, partly in response to the Protestant schism, the Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the Counter-Reformation.<br>  <br>  Although the Church maintains that it is the "one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church" founded by Jesus Christ, where one can find the fullness of the means of salvation, it acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of other Christian communities to bring people to salvation. It believes that it is called by the Holy Spirit to work for unity among all Christians, a movement known as ecumenism.

The Gospel of St. Luke continues:<br>  <br>      “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women!”<br>  <br>      “Fear not, Mary, for thou has found grace with God. Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call His Name, Jesus... The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy One which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”<br>  <br>  Who can deny the dignity of the Virgin Mary — chosen to be the Mother of Jesus Christ? The Angel Gabriel, who was sent by God Himself, honored and praised her.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, when the Virgin Mary visited her cousin, St. Elizabeth<br>  <br>      “was filled with the Holy Ghost, and she cried out with a loud voice and said: ‘Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?’”<br>  <br>  Once again, honor and praise is rendered to the Virgin Mary by St. Elizabeth, “who was filled with the Holy Ghost”<br>  <br>  Then during this same visitation, the Virgin Mary responded to her cousin’s praise of her by the prayer so full of humility and of praise to God:<br>  <br>      “My soul doth magnify the Lord... because He hath regarded the humility of His handmaid; for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For He that is mighty hath done great things to me.”<br>  <br>  However they Priest from Judaism have passed down some traditions in the catholic church. Or someone took some traditions of rituals and transferred them in the catholic church. Rituals is what Protestants run from or avoid. The book of Leviticus chapters 4,5,6,7 all talk about traditions including sin offerings, in which explains why the catholic church believe in the priest at confession time. The Priest were depended on for the atonement, blessing, offerings, counciling of course.  <br>  <br>  The catholic church is into candles, incense as in Judaism, and the protestants are not. The Catholics believe the importance of communion, but the protestants do not believe it is necessary. <br>  Catholics are more careful about what they eat certain days of the year, while the protestants say it is ok to eat what ever when ever. <br>  <br>  So it seems that the Catholics have more similarities with Judaism then Protestants. <br>  <br>   Rituals is what make the catholic church so beautify. Jesus Christ was a Jew, so this explains that. <br>  <br>  The Protestant bible is missing these books: Tobit, Judith, wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, 1 and 2 Maccabees, and parts of Esther and Daniel. <br>  <br>  The difference in the catholic and protestant bibles arose in the following manner. the Jews living in the few centuries before Christ were divided into two groups, the Jews dwelling in Palestine and speaking Hebrew, and the large number of Jews scattered throughout the roman empire and speaking the Greek language, and consequence of the conquest of Alexander the great of Greece. <br>  <br>  I could go on forever so i gave you some links.|`|M52pI93Aaa	The Roman Catholic Church was the first and created by God and his son   <br>  Jesus Christ and the Protestant church was made in england by king Henry so that he could leave his wife (kill her as well) he also enjoyed the fact that he would be the ''pope''.<br>  <br>  the protestant church was really made so a sick man could divorce his wife.|`|JWNzoksmaa	Protestants are against having a good time...seriously.

If you're a Christian and are divorced and remarried, then you are living in sin and committing adulterous acts with the new spouse.  Jesus was quite clear about this and there's NO other way.  You must renounce your sinful life, return to your first spouse and reconcile.  There's no room for error.<br>  Homosexuality is also wrong, accordingly; it's an abomination, just like eating shelfish, or touching a woman who is menstrating.  Again, there's no wiggle room; in fact, all homosexuals should be dealt with in the harshest terms and there's NO room for tolerance or forgiveness.  The Bible is quite clear.<br>  Oh, wait, there are Christians who are divorced and remarried?

I won't speak for others, but I personally believe both to be legitimate practices. <br>  <br>  I don't believe in a God that would rather see a couple go through life tortured by a troubled relationship, one that negatively impacts not only themselves, but their family (and most importantly, their children) than simply get a divorce. We are all human, and as such, we are all prone to mistakes - this includes choosing the wrong person to spend our lives with. That said, marriage is one of the biggest decisions of our lives and it should not be taken lightly. The reason many Christians have a problem with divorce is not so much because they see the practice as inherently "wrong" but because they see the practices leading up to the divorce as irresponsible (i.e. marrying too soon, marrying because of a pregnancy, marrying for money). <br>  <br>  As far as homosexuality is concerned, it is a topic that I am torn on and I believe many Christians share my sentiments. The Bible does indeed say that homosexuality is a sin, and as with all sins, it should be avoided. That said, I can't say that if I wanted to, I could make myself enjoy having sex with another man. I don't think my sister could choose to enjoy having sex with another woman. Simply put, I don't see homosexuality as a choice. The biggest point on this issue, is that in God's eyes, a sin is a sin is a sin. The Bible states that no one can enter the Kingdom of Heaven without being completely sinless. Since no one on Earth is capable of such a feat, God sent us Jesus Christ who died for our sins. Whether you eat too much cake, you lie to your parents, you steal a dollar from you grandmother's purse or you engage in gay sex, the fact of the matter is that you have sinned. Most important of all, however, is the fact that regardless of what sins you may engage in on this Earth, if you ask for forgiveness, it will be granted and thus, in the end, nothing else matters. <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped to clear a few things up for you and some of the other posters on here.|`|4BPYNiKVaa	having sex should be a responsible action, because it may result in a new life, in a child, it should not be taken lightly, so a person should choose to do it and take responsibility ......... in advance, and not to do it , just for pleasure, it is the miracle of life we are talking about, let us not make it just a lust !|`|cMgcqhxnaa	Not ALL christians believe that, However I do kind of agree with the whole Divorce thing depending if your actually trying to make things work.

lcvhhGjpaa	You have 2 cultures here mixing.<br>  <br>  Firstly, the Jews don't believe that Jesus is the Messiah, they also do not use the BC/AD or BCE/CE method.  They just think it is the year 5769.<br>  <br>  I would suppose the people who are describing this historically are using what they know as BC/AD or BCE/CE.<br>  <br>  BCE (before common era) is the same as (Before Christ)<br>  CE (common era) is the same as AD (Anno Domini) Latin, for 'Year of our Lord'.<br>  <br>  Because so much of history has been set using this method, it would be a real mess if we stopped using it.  However, because Christians are actually a minority, only 33% of the worlds population, the CE/BCE method is a PC way for all, even if it based around the same year 0.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  The Jews use the Torah and the Tanakh.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah</a><br>  <br>  Both were written before Jesus, (if you believe Jesus the Messiah), appeared.<br>  <br>  They do not use the Hebrew bible, this was a later rewrite containing parts of the above mentioned, which was used by the Early Church Fathers in their writings of the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew bible is not used by the Jews, it is called the Hebrew bible because most of it was originally written in Hebrew.  Don't get confused by this term.<br>  <br>  Jesus, (if he existed), was said to be an observant Jew, he quoted the Torah.|`|AA12203324	Even though there were Christians, there were still Jews, and they didn't believe Jesus was any kind of "messiah" or any "fulfillment of prophecy".  In fact, they didn't even call their scriptures the "Old Testament".  They called them the "Law", the "Prophets" and the "Writings".  In 90, they were pretty much settled on the Law and Prophets.  It was those later, straggler works they were debating.  And the only reason they were worrying about which books were "scripture" at all was because they'd lost their homeland, and were worried that their faith would begin to transform into whatever was locally convenient or popular, and they'd lose their common identity.<br>  <br>  They decided that Ezra was the last official prophet, so anyone who appeared to be writing later than that was to be discarded. Only they didn't know how to date scrolls, other than circumstantially.  Since Daniel claimed to be writing during the Exile, they assumed he was, even though the book was more likely written in the Maccabean period.  The Books of Maccabees could only be found in Greek, not Hebrew, so they were considered too late.  Essentially, any works in the "Septuagint" Greek translation that didn't have Hebrew versions were excluded.  Jesus just didn't enter into the decisions.<br>  <br>  But Christians didn't read anything in Hebrew.  The Septuagint was all they knew, so they had no idea what the Jews had decided.  The Septuagint was their entire Bible, until it started looking like Jesus wasn't coming back for a while.  Only then did they start thinking about compiling some "scriptures" of their own.  And only then did they start referring to the existing scriptures as "old".|`|luwBPdE8aa	The books of the law and the prophets already existed, but the meeting in 90 AD was to determine a consensus of what books would be considered inspired.  It doesn't mean the books were not already written.<br>  In the late 1940's, some scrolls were discovered that were dated to 200 BC and among the scrolls were parts of every Old Testament book except Esther, and a nearly complete scroll of Isaiah was found.|`|AA12189772	"C.E" just means "common era."  Since "A.D" means "Anno Domini," or "in the year of our Lord," it doesn't make sense for non-Christians to use that abbreviation.  <br>  <br>  It wouldn't be too late for the rabbis to compile the Tanakh in the written form, Jesus' theoretical arrival had no impact on Judaism itself, since he has nothing to do with that faith.   <br>  <br>  I'm not actually sure when the Tanakh was compiled in the written form.  I don't have time to do the research right now, but you might try the site, suggested below.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	You're right. So maybe Christ never did actually arrive after all.<br>  <br>  (Or maybe the rabbis didn't care, since he didn't matter to them)<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, I see your problem. While I hadn't heard of rabbis gathering the books together in 90 CE, I'll assume that's true for the sake of argument. But so what? the books were written about 2,000 years before the gospels were written. So they existed. Perhaps they hadn't yet been gathered together in a final form, but they certainly existed.|`|AA10556726	The Rabbis did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, so the date had little effect on their decision.  Also the term "AD" did not come into useage until the Gregorian calendar was instituted in the middle ages.|`|AA10091424	It's possible that the OT was formed before Christ, and re-formed after Christ.<br>  <br>  It's also possible that the OT books existed separately, and that after Christ, the Hebrew rabbis complied the OT, deciding which books belonged and which didn't.  The OT mentions quite a few books that are not found in the OT.  ("As for the rest of the story of X, is it not found in the Book of Y?")|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	The Hebrew Bible was set before the first century.<br>  <br>  Perhaps there was a meeting in 90 CE, that doesn't count for much though. For example, the Catholics had been using the apocryphal books for over a thousand years before it became 'official' in the sixteenth century.|`|TfWIcohcaa	The Hebrew tradition and lore was passed down orally for many thousands of years before Jesus.

(Anno Domini, or "year of our Lord") dating method derived from a monk named Dionysius Exiguus (Dennis the Little), in the sixth-century who used it in his Easter tables. Oddly, some people seem to think this has relevance to a historical Jesus. But of course it has nothing at all to do with it. In the time before and during the 6th century, people used various other dating methods. The Romans used A.U.C. (anno urbis conditae, "year of the founded city," that being Rome). The Jews had their own dating system. Not until the tenth century did most churches accept the new dating system. The A.D. system simply reset the time of January 1, 754 A.U.C. to January 1, of year one A.D., which Dionysius obliquly derived from the belief of the date of "incarnation" of Jesus . The date, if one uses the Bible as history, can't possibly hold true. *<br>  <br>  Instead of B.C. and A.D., I have used the convention of B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) and C.E. (Common Era) as often used in scholarly literature. They correspond to the same dates as B.C. and A.D., but without alluding to the birth or death of an alleged Christ.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	The terms "Common Era", "Anno Domini", "Before the Common Era" and "Before Christ" can be applied to dates that rely on either the Julian calendar or the Gregorian calendar. Modern dates are understood in the Western world to be in the Gregorian calendar, but for older dates writers should specify the calendar used. Dates in the Gregorian calendar have always used the Common Era, but over the millennia a wide variety of eras have been used with the Julian calendar.<br>  <br>  Although the Jewish people have their own Hebrew calendar, they often find it convenient to use the Gregorian Calendar as well. The reasons for some using Common Era notation are described below:<br>  <br>  Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our L-rd [sic]," and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd [sic]. Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era).[49]<br>  <br>  so you will have to find out what calander they are using in order to compare it to what you are more familar with...either AD or BC...but your reading a book so I will assume that it is most likely fiction. I could be wrong but I don't think that the Jewish people have a book that leads up to what books where chosen for the Torah do they?|`|nVhP1Bteaa	Maybe they are talking about the Bible in the Hebrew language,and not necessarily the Old Testament. ( Which would have been referred to as the Torah.)

You need to decide what your beliefs are and where your moral compass is and find a religion (or sect of a religion) that fits you.  Most religions, despite what some conservative Christians might say, have violent and horrible things in their texts that are not followed today.  Slavery is condoned in the Christian bible for instance but Christians have chosen to ignore this in modern times.  If you don't believe that Jews are evil or that Islam is violent, don't join a Mosque that believes those things.  Find people that have similar beliefs and organize with them.|`|KKkOPwZMaa	visit some reliable sites with good material on the Faith. <br>  <br>  This one is a good example <a href="http://www.kalamullah.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kalamullah.com/</a><br>  <br>  Learn about Islam, just research on the questions you have in mind.<br>  <br>  This isn't really a good place to ask about Islam, Why? because a lot of the users here are teenagers, and we lack in knowledge.

6Q4xh4F1aa	Most have not and will not look.  They are so well programmed that any mention of the "A" word sends shivers up their spines.  if they are online they are limited to going to wt.org.  They are not allowed to even be posting on here or even discussing religion with anyone online, not even other jw's if it involves independant study. (Our Kingdom Ministry September 2007 Questions from the readers)<br>  <br>  The Watchtower cult leadership fears information more than anything.  They would love nothing more than to keep all of their people shut inside and only allowed to read their books and magazines.  They struggle every day with the huge amount of information that shows them for the child-molesting, misogynistic, money grubbing, blasphemous fiends they are.<br>  <br>  If you go through their literature or even better, their Library CD-ROM, you will find how they repeat the words Internet and Dangers together so many times that the two words become joined at the hip so to speak.  In fact I counted 143 times where Internet and Dangers appeared on a page together.  It seems to me like they are really working overtime to make sure their followers get the message that the Internet is bad.  <br>  <br>  I wonder how worried they are about people going to the doors of people they do not know for face to face confrontations while selling their literature.  I mean with all the dogs, apostates, and unfriendly, violent and evil “Worldly” people that are under Satan’s control you would think there would be a concern for their safety, right?  Let’s see, I went to my handy-dandy WT-CD and searched for Door-To Door Dangers.  Guess how many entries I found in their literature.  ONE (1).  Yes, just one. And it made some obscure reference to the dangers of preaching in Nazi Germany.<br>  <br>  Speaking of Nazi Germany, their Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels made an extraordinary statement.<br>  <br>   “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”<br>  <br>  Let’s see how it looks after my alteration for emphasis of my point…<br>  <br>  “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the Watchtower Society can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the Watchtower Society to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the Watchtower Society.”|`|wRBfUgI2aa	I only have dial-up available.

NYU37jfGaa	The House of Valois ruled France from 1328-1589. The first Valois King was Philip VI, who was followed by Charles V, Charles VI, Charles VII, Louis XI, Charles VIII, Louis XII, Francois I, Henri II, FRancois II, Charles IX.  The last Valois King was Henri III, who was assassinated in 1589, after which the throne passed to his cousin, King Henri IV, the first of the Bourbon kings.<br>  <br>  The Valois monarchs had large numbers of descendents, and I would think that there are probably hundreds of thousands of people by now who could claim descent from them, so it doesn't really mean anything important, but it is interesting.|`|CM1dfztQaa	If there was still a ruling monarchy, it would matter, but it just means you have royal blood lines.

Xt9wIj4Iaa	The American Standard Version was considered the most accurate translation in the first part of the 20th century. But it contained the name Jehovah. Because of people's prejudice against that name, it the ASV wasn't used as much as it should have been. the New American Standard Version took it's place. It was a completely new translation that is inferior to its predecessor, and it completely removed God's name. God's name doesn't *sell.* Bible translators tend to be more concerned with money than the integrity of the translation.<br>  <br>  The New World Translation continued with the spirit of the ASV - the translators tried to represent the original meaning in English as closely as they could.

I would not encourage anyone to try and read it cover to cover especially those books in the OT. The books of the NT are those I would focus on but again without the true Catholic Faith it is easy to misinterpret Sacred Scripture:<br>  <br>  "As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction."<br>  <br>  Look at how many Protestant sects there are. So they can quote Scripture...the devil can quote it better than any Protestant or other heretic.<br>  <br>  The Douay Rheims Holy Bible (DRB) with commentaries in English by the Rev. George Leo Haydock is just right for those who are a bit rusty in ecclesiastical latin.<br>  <br>  The DRB doesn't pander to the enemies of the Church as do those versions that are the product of Modernist Church in Rome and their heresy.<br>  <br>  Outside of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church there is absolutely no salvation.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	Probably the two best are the New King James Version (NKJV) and the New International Version (NIV).<br>  <br>  So, you would do well with either of those, or if you can, a parallel Bible with both these versions in it, side-by-side, would be an excellent choice.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	The Latin Vulgate is the most accurate, the Douay Rheims is a faithful English translation.  There is the Challoner edition which is a translation of the Douay Rheims but has been altered and not been as faithfully translated from Old English to modern English, but it is still more accurate than all other modern bibles.  e.g., Habacuc 3: 18 "But I will joy in our Lord: and will rejoice in God my JESUS." which is from the Douay Rheims and also the Challoner Revised Douay Rheims.  Where as it is "yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior." (Habakkuk 3, 18) in all modern bibles.<br>  <br>  If you would like to look through the Douay Rheims, I have a PDF Copy which has been properly updated from Old English, just send me an email.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	Personally I enjoy the NET bible.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://net.bible.org/home.php" rel="nofollow">http://net.bible.org/home.php</a><br>  <br>  Because it is all cross referenced and everything is there available at the touch of a button. To include going back to the original Greek and Hebrew.<br>  <br>  The New King James is a good version as well as the NIV or the NASB.<br>  <br>  I avoid paraphrases such as the Living Bible and the Message as they are just done by one person who may or may not have any background in the languages of the bible.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	You don't look for a easier to understand Bible because they are not of God but of satan's counterfeits. The Bible is not for our personal interpretation, but for us to turn to the Holy Ghost and ask Him to open up His Word to us when we read the KJV Bible. The Bible is a deliberate mystery opened up onto to those who are believers. <br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:20-21  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br>   <br>  21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. <br>  <br>   1 Corinthians 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:<br>  <br>  Ephesians 3:3-4  How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, (The Bible)<br>  <br>  4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)|`|HMteUyRdaa	I love the Douay Rheims bible I have it online and at home in book form.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://drbo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://drbo.org/</a><br>  Love <br>  Kate|`|AA10847209	Jack T.Chick Bible Tracts ( collect em all!)

The Douay-Rheims version is also very good. If you can read Latin, go for the Vulgate.<br>  <br>  I'd say the KJV has the nicest and most beautiful language, but is not the best scholarly translation. Sorry protestants.|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	The King James Version translation was done under the scrutiny of a King. These translators were careful not to make mistakes. It was also done close to the time Shakespear wrote his plays. Shakespears plays have been studied by everybody as the best example of the use of the English language. I realize that style of English is hard to understand but a good dictionary can usually clear things up. There are a lot of other translations that have too many mistakes. The KJV is usually just misinterpreted|`|f55f4ea7b436bdd9d2644c0df2803e20aa	As a pure literal translation which is faithful to the original tongues,<br>  the New American Standard is probably the Best. The King James is also very good. No translation is perfect. Only the Author is. As far as the written name of God, the ancient Text written and copied by ancient scribes, use only the letters "YHWH" This was done out of respect to the Supreme Holiness of God. Modern Translators have rendered this as Yaweh or Yhovah which in english is written as Jehovah. These are only educated guesses as to the proper name of God. No one really knows for certain.|`|BonyOJLRaa	The New Living Translation (NLT) in my opinion, is easiest to read and understand. I love my Life Application Study Bible in this translation, it is really insightful.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	I don't know what you mean, most Bibles still have Holy Bible written on it, but that's besides is the point.NIV is really the best, but any true translation is fine.|`|0c7afeab4d0a2cffaae3b6f595659888aa	I think 'On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'. is the best one.|`|EmyMvE3Vaa	Aramaic......Oh that's right, they've never found anything that looks like a babble in that language|`|DDwecKakaa	your mamas|`|hiRYCT2Haa	Wait.

The best modern English translation in my view is the English Standard Version.|`|hiCSVwchaa	It's part of Abrahamic tradition predating Christianity that you don't say his name.<br>  <br>  ETA: I love it when I get thumbs down for the truth.<br>  <br>  (Of course, his name is not actually god...)|`|wRBfUgI2aa	Depends on what language you need.  If it is modern English, the best one stop shopping would be the New World Translation.  Although it would be best to use several translations to get the full meaning of the original Bible writers in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic.<br>  <br>  Interesting that one guy says Jehovah is not God's personal name.  As that is exactly what most translations starting in 1500s and following with the King James in 1611 said it was in English.  Do you think that is his personal wish or just not thinking straight?  Obviously it reads that way in millions of copies of Bibles in many translations.<br>  <br>  I will even give you an example of this:  Hebrews 10:25 in the NWT says, "Do not forsake the gathering of ourselves together."  The New Jerusalem Bible renders it, "Do not miss meetings."  I believe that gives a clearer meaning.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	If Jesus and the Disciples respected the custom of not using the Holy name of God that's good enough for me.  I care not what the JWs think on this matter.|`|AA12203324	That's a mighty narrow criterion for translation.  Don't things like ideas count?|`|qxteTM9Kaa	I like the King James

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Chicago, USA.  The Beatles were made popular on the radio first so by the time they came to the US, they were already well-known and Beatlemania was already rampant.  They weren't played non-stop no the radio since there were other "top ten" songs that had to be played but since they always had at least one song in the top ten, their songs played at least once an hour.  Their PR was good for that time too, lots of ads, lots of contests, lots of everything to focus on the boys.  I guess I first heard of them on the radio when one of the djs made a big deal of playing a song by 4 British guys who seemed to be very popular in Europe--and I was hooked.  I was about 12.  From that point on, I had a transistor radio pressed to my ear as often as possible (had no ear buds yet) and trying to buy new transistor batteries was a major project for me since I had to replace them about every 3 days.  I even listened in my sleep.  Some of a little school friends were Beatle fans too so I wasn't alone.  I remember my parents being very offended at the Beatles' "long hair"--and when I look at those pictures now they still look neat and tidy and hair isn't long at all.  My fav was John 'cause he was soooo witty, I wanted to be as spontaneously witty as John always seemed to be.  Never got to see them live though, just couldn't afford the price of tickets (parents probably wouldn't have allowed it anyway).  I do remember making sure everyone in the family knew that the tv was mine when the Beatles made their first Ed Sullivan appearance--I wasn't a big tv watcher so when I made a BIG point of claiming the tv, I guess the family honored that request (or command?).|`|xLabGD6Maa	They were on the Ed Sullivan Show in Feb., 1964.  I was 10.  I'd never seen guys with hair that long!  My parents, who were only 34, thought they were atrocious.  At school the next day, everyone was talking about them.  I wasn't really caught up in it all, but I was certainly curious.  I didn't appreciate their music till many years later.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	My little 9 yr old behind was parked in front of the tv crying right along. Not really sure why, I suppose everyone else was, so I followed suit. Gosh, Paul was adorable. I was in love with the Beatles for sure after that night. I still have their first album.|`|a4LWildhaa	Even our parents were psyched to watch their debut on the Ed Sullivan Show. No crush-I'm a guy.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	I was 3 1/2 years old the first time they appeared on the Ed Sullivan show.  They performed Please please me, and Love me do from their album Introducing the Beatles.  In those days our television was black and white, and had tubes in it.  The size of the picture was about the size of a modern day computer monitor. The cabinet it was in was quite large in comparison, televisions were actual furniture back then, not just appliances.  I didn't understand why the girls in the audience were screaming, but I screamed too :)  It was a "really big shoe". My parents taught me how to twist, and I got a stitch in my side. They were a hit from the word go.  No, not everyone loved them, and especially not after John made his "bigger than God" remark that was taken so wrong.  I had crushes on all of them in turn at one time or another :)  Guys got jealous of them and there were songs out there about guys who were jealous of the Beatles. Even the Beatles wrote a song about a guy who was jealous of the Beatles, called "Baby's in Black", which was about girls who went into mourning after Paul got married.  As you can see by my userid, Beatlemania stuck! After the Beatles broke up, all any Beatlefan ever wanted was for them to get back together.  In the late 70's, a band named Klaatu made an album, and sold lots of copies by perpetuating rumors that they were the Beatles back together under a fictitious name, and offering bogus "clues" as to their identity, in the manner like where the Beatles songs and album covers supposedly contained "clues" to things like Paul's rumored death.  They weren't the Beatles really, but they sure knew how to take advantage. I never got to see them in person, I was too young.  At least I got to see Beatlemania when they were on the road.  I'll never forget the night John was shot...but that is another story.  Favorite album: Abbey Road.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I saw them for the first time, on the Ed Sullivan Show on TV in the<br>  black and white TV days. I remember thinking that those boys needed<br>  haircuts. And my parents said the same thing. I couldn't understand<br>  alot of the lyrics they were singing, and I didn't know what those <br>  younger girls in the immediate audience were so excited about. It <br>  was a far cry from when Elvis was on that very same stage, and set<br>  the world on fire, from his waist up. <br>     The Beatles appealed to my twin sisters who are nine years younger. And later one of them, went to England as a student for a<br>  year. She loved England, but didn't like the cold water faucets or <br>  having to boil water to bathe in. She grew to love Fish and Chips<br>  as it was an affordable means of surviving, when she was forced to<br>  eat out to have a meal. The family she lived with, were not friendly,<br>  and their home was definately a bad match with her. Elvis's music<br>  tended to be on the decline, after the Beatles hit the music scene.<br>  But I stayed true to his music. Despite the music he made in his<br>  later films. I also followed other singers of that time.<br>   I never liked the Beatles or their music, I'm afraid. And<br>  most definitely, I never had a crush on one of their members.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	I cant recall if the Beatles made any stops in Chicago but that pretty close to my hometown. About all I recall is that, at one point, the only thing you seemed to see on TV was the Beatles or the Kennedy assassination. I was in the fifth grade then.<br>  <br>  I guess I was born at the wrong time. Too late to really appreciate Elvis and some of the older groups and only like the Beatles first few songs. I was really more for Roy Orbison and the Beach Boys, Four Season etc.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I saw them on TV (Ed Sullivan show) and then I attended a concert to see them in Seattle, WA. in 1964. <br>  <br>  I couldn't hear any music for all the screaming and I barely could see the stage because we were in the balcony-- (nose bleed section.) They appeared like small ants on stage, they were so far away.<br>  <br>  I thought everyone was nuts,  even some boys were screaming and crying just like the girls. (Not me, I just tried to hear the music.)<br>  <br>  Fun times!|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I was only seven or eight years old when I saw them on the Ed Sullivan show and I was hooked on rock and roll from there on.  In 1967 a local radio station had a call in vote between the Monkees and Beatles and the Monkees won.  You can't account for taste.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Remember being on leave from the Army, stationed in Germany, in Barcelona, Spain in 1964, when a gal I was dating got all excited about going to this bull fight ring, thinking I was going to see a bull fight  it was the Beatles on there 1964 world tour -  don't speak Spanish and never cared for the Beatles.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	America, South Dakota and it was a screaming crying mad house.<br>  Yes they were well received and all had great fun.<br>  Much press and celebration. It was well orchestrated.<br>  I don't know that our parents loved them and certainly frowned on many of the fads that developed but I do think the youth embraced them.|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	We knew in advance that they would be on the Ed Sullivan Show.  Many families did not have television, so everyone went to a friend's who had one. I think my neighbor had 30-35 people crowded around a small B&W tv.|`|AA12185428	I watched the arrival on the afternoon news and had no idea what they were talking about or who they were. Very quickly I was in love with their music and Ringo. Favorite album, Rubber Soul.|`|ZQyAlNhjaa	I was not around, but my mom was young and she's told me about it. Her family was like the only people not to have a television (her dad is stubborn lol) and the day after The Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show (when they really became huge stars), everyone in her second grade class were all talking about them and who they thought was the cutest and she felt so left out haha. So she and her older sisters made their dad go and buy them "Beatles' Cards" at the drugstore (like baseball cards but with the members of the Beatles on them.) so they wouldn't feel left out. Lol I love this story.  : ) My mom had a crush on Paul McCartney (of course) Oh yeah, she lived in a suburb of St. Louis, MO.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	I was working my first job out of high school. i worked for an large insurance company in LA and use to have to go to an old old building to look up old records.  A co-worker, from England, asked me if I had seen the Beatles and I jumped up on a chair. i thought she meant the crawly kind. lol.<br>  <br>  they were popular right away and they were heard all the time on the radio. I thought they were cute but that they wore their hair kind of long. I was use to flat tops and crew cuts.<br>  <br>  I liked John the best but over the years switched to Paul. what a fabulous group|`|wmSSCZ5paa	I will luv Paul to the day I die.  Good thing he unloaded that nasty piece of work Heather Mills!   <br>  <br>  The memory that stands out clearest for me was at home with my mum and the regular television programming in our area stopped to go live and watch the Beatles as they deplaned at the Vancouver International Airport for a concert date.  <br>  <br>  That was 1964 - I remember it like it was yesterday.  There has been no group like them since.|`|KWwW7N49aa	It was the most exciting thing.  I was not able to get tickets to see them when they came to my city, but just knowing they were in town was a thrill!  Yeah yeah yeah  I had a crush on Georgy cause he was the shy Beatle.  I Want To Hold Your Hand was playing on the radio!
CM1dfztQaa	If you want it to seem authentic, he wouldn't have used a protest sign. He would have written a proclamation denouncing the church.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Henry VIII did not really regard himself as a Protestant.  Although he broke from the Church of Rome, and made himself head of the Church of England, he did not think of himself as Protestant, and in fact contiuned to persecute Protestants during his reign.  His last wife, Katherine Parr, for example, got into trouble for supporting the cause of Anne Askew, a Protestant heretic who was burnt at the stake by Henry.<br>  <br>  Henry's main reasons for wanting an independent church were 1. so that he could annul his mariage to Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, and 2. so that he could get his hands on the wealth of the monasteries.  <br>  <br>  He did not take the lands and wealth of the church in order to give them to 'the people' as a comment above suggests, he took them for the enrichment of himself and his nobility.  And in fact the poor people, who had relied on monasteries for help in times of need, were often left worse off as a result of the Dissolution.|`|5rP0zBudaa	You are probably better talking about how the church and monasteries had all of the wealth and land and the people had very little. So the monasteries had to be abolished.<br>  <br>  Louise: Maybe i should have explained a little better. By the "people i meant the nobility and king. At the time they were considered the people or at least the only ones who mattered (although im pretty sure they condidered themselves and representing the normal people). The normal pesants  started with very little and still had very little.|`|zRyI5CMGaa	A sign would be him holding a scroll in one hand ( if it was me doing a sign for him it would be an axe in the other hand), he made proclamations as someone said. Everyone had to agree with him being the head of the Church of England or it was off with their head.As well a few of his poor wife's, either that or they were discarded for not giving him a son.|`|AA11950233	he just protested so he could get a divorce. He didn't care about religion. <br>  <br>    he got tired of her & wanted a divorce. The Church said no so he started his own.|`|AA11307951	Perfect protest sign for Henry VIII:<br>  <br>  "Change the Church! I need a Boy!"
hetZz4c1aa	Perhaps you could mention in your statement that Diana, Princess of Wales would not have been able to spell "thesis".<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA12095483	A thesis statement is the summation of what you discovered through your research. If you have done your research and it has led you to a new idea about Princess Diana, that is what your thesis statement should be about. <br>  If you are simply writing an essay about Princess Diana, you can use any introductory sentence you wish. <br>  There is a difference between a thesis and an essay and a thesis statement and an introduction.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	If you have gathered the information for the paper, you should have come to the conclusion of what you intend to convey.  That conclusion is your Thesis Statement.  All the evidence should amplify the basic message you are trying to communicate.
dPJr1Lbmaa	There are only some sects who celebrate his birthday not all Muslims. Sects are forbidden so if a sect is celebrating it, they are not following Islam to begin with so....As a Muslim its not something I celebrate nor are we supposed to as Muslim no matter the country. We are not to idolize him or worship him and we certainly are not required to celebrate his birthday. The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) did not celebrate his birthday and would not like others doing so. I have found this link but it does not say the public holiday is for this purpose but that there is a national holiday on the 8th March...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.qppstudio.net/public-holidays-news-updates/200903.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.qppstudio.net/public-holidays...</a>|`|AA12203324	I would doubt it.  The celebration of the Prophet's Birthday is a Shia custom, and Turkey is still, nominally, an secular government (leaning slightly Sunni).  But I couldn't say for sure.
2zgv89OQaa	Everything we have is because God has blessed us with it.  If we gamble it away, we are not being good stewards.  The Bible tells us to abstain from all appearances of evil.  Nothing good comes from gambling.  It can become very addictive and that is where the sin comes in.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	It doesn't, directly.  I think that some Christians oppose gambling because it is addictive, it promotes greed, it isn't productive & is a waste of time & money (but so is all entertainment) and it is simply a way of taking advantage of stupid people who don't understand probability or statistics.|`|JqHkgWROaa	It doesnt.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	People love money and that is why they gamble.<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.<br>  <br>  They depend on the prospect of making a killing with their gambling to make their ends meet, instead of turning to the Lord and you cannot serve two masters.<br>  <br>  Luke 16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	The Bible doesn't say that. Guess that's why so many churches have B-I-N-G-O!|`|WxaCK4C7aa	where does it say its not?|`|AA11142539	I don't think gambling is a sin in the bible, but it is usually associated with things that are considered sinful, like greed and pride... even these "sins" are not exactly spelled out as sins unless you read Dante.<br>  <br>  There are quite a few churches and organized religions however that consider it sinful, likely because of the potential damage it can cause to a family... a sin by doctrine and dogma, rather than with a biblical reference.|`|nxEoR9CEaa	It doesn't.  Yet the "spiritual leaders", call gambling a sin and are very much opposed to casinos and gambling institutions.  I believe in the separation of church and state.

I don't go to the casino to make a buck.  I take a set amount of cash on me, as if i where to go to an amusement park or whatever, and I spend on the games they have there.  This form of entertainment has a chance of giving me money back, too.  So, that is how I set up the question.  He told me that it's how gambeling and the casinos affect people and their lifestyles.

1cGlucXyaa	You are right. The Bible says that we are all sinners. We have all broken Gods Law and deserve to go to hell. Nothing we do can change that. But God does not want us to go to hell. This is why Jesus died on the cross. He took our place, He took our punishment. The Bible says that if you repent and place your faith in Him you will be saved. <br>  <br>  And your few chosen comment is talking about predestination which is truly biblical. God knows who will believe and who will not. Jesus told us to go into all the world and spread the Gospel, but He tells us that not everyone will believe. Jesus said that there are two roads. A wide road which leads to destruction and a narrow road that leads to eternal life. Jesus said He was the only way to get to the Father and the He is the Door "symbolically" only those that come through Him can get into heaven.<br>  <br>  Edit: No little prayer persay can save you, the Apostels and Jesus preached repent. They never went arund praying a little prayer. And how in the world can we go up to God, with what audasity and say I accept you. God has to accept us. The Bible says repent and believe, but it never says accept Jesus.|`|if8pS6cGaa	Whisper this prayer to God so that only you can hear yourself and say:<br>  <br>  Lord Jesus I ask you to forgive me now of all my sins and come into my heart as I now repent of all my sins and be my own personal Lord and savior and save me now from all sin and hell, write my name in the lambs book of life so that on judgment day I will be allowed to enter heaven for accepting Jesus’s sacrifice of dying on the cross for me and I will not be cast into hell which  was not prepared for me but was prepared for the devil and his angels, I thank you now Lord Jesus that I am now saved and on my way to heaven because you are now in my heart as you have promised if I ask you to come in as you are not liar but are a God of your word,  now teach me all your correct ways and truths in which you would have me walk and make all my ways well pleasing in Your sight even as a sweet fragrance to thy nostrils and a sweet sound to thine ears In Jesus Holy Name, Amen.<br>  <br>  <br>  The choosing is yours, I choose to be Gods elect and Gods chosen therefore I am His chosen and His elect, it is my choice, God let's me choose to be His elect or not, it's that simple, I have decided to be one of His few.|`|27vAxPSnaa	"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he SAVED US, BY the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost" (Titus 3:5)<br>  <br>  "they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance . . .

Not that the being better is what does it, it just shows God that you truly mean it. We cannot fathom God's ways, I don't know why He chose me, I've done plenty of wrong in my life.

Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world.  It means believing that He is the Son of God and that He suffered for your sins, afflictions, and infirmities.  When you have faith in Christ, you accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings.  Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. <br>  It is important to note that faith in God is more than a theoretical belief in Him; it is a principle of action and power.  To have faith in God is to be willing to act on your belief in Him.  Heavenly Father requires that you act with hope and trust in Him before you see a final outcome (Alma 32:21).  <br>  Having faith causes you to try as hard as you can to learn about and become more like your Savior, doing all you can to bring about what you hope and pray for.  Although you may still sin, you show your love for Him by striving to keep His commandments and avoiding sin. <br>  You can pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation or to develop faith in a particular principle, such as the Word of Wisdom or tithing. by first believing in Jesus Christ strongly enough to obey His commandments.  You can help your faith grow by hearing the word of God ( Romans 10:17) and by reading the word of God ( Helaman 15:7–8). <br>  As you obey God, He blesses you.  He gives you power to meet life’s challenges and helps you change the desires of your heart.  Through your faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal you, both physically and spiritually.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	GOD Judges the heart...you must ask for forgiveness and then turn away from your sins.....and you must fight temtation until you die because<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:13 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   13But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved|`|97sKOWQ0aa	One night i felt real bad<br>  <br>  I said with all of my heart.<br>  Jesus I am a sinner,I believe with all of my heart that you did die on the cross for me and You rose from the dead,Jesus i want You to be my Lord.Forgive my sins and Come into my heart, Then i felt a peace come over me and this warm love.<br>  <br>  I knew Jesus saved me that night.<br>  <br>  John 3 v 16-18<br>  <br>  16For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life.<br>  <br>      17For God did not send the Son into the world in order to judge (to reject, to condemn, to pass sentence on) the world, but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him.<br>  <br>      18He who believes in Him [who clings to, trusts in, relies on Him] is not judged [he who trusts in Him never comes up for judgment]|`|ArKT9O7Maa	None of these questions can be answered with evidence.

Look, in order to be save, it is not jst about asking forgiveness, you have to accept Jesus as the Son og God and ur savior and have Him in your heart. It usually happens when you truly believe in him and that you are nothing without him...and then, you ask for him to dwell in your heart.<br>  <br>  God tries to call everybody to His kingdom. He loves EVERYONE in this world, even the lost. He wants all his children to live with him in Heaven someday. The "few are" chosen part is that much of the ppl who hears his call, they just ignore it and keep living their way of life...<br>  Some wont even listen, because of all of wat they have heard in society...<br>  <br>  Paul, as an example, killed christians, wouldnt you say he was not worthy to be a man of God? but yet, he became a man of God.

But think about the pharisees and Sadducees in the Bible. These were the good people of the time!! They followed every rule, and look how Jesus responded to them. Now the sinners of the day, the horrible people of that day and age, were the people Jesus hung out with!! It seems backwards to us. I suppose it was backwards then. <br>  <br>  Heaven is for the forgiven. If you aren't forgiven, you don't go to heaven no matter how good you were in this life. It's hard to accept.

When he stood before the judge he was found guilty and was sentenced to death. No one questioned the judge's judgment because the law said that those who murder must be punished.<br>  <br>  So it is with God. God does not love the death of others.  But because he is a fair judge he must judge by the law. God's law.<br>  <br>  The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him. Ezekiel 18:20<br>  <br>  The good news is that Jesus paid the price of our sin so we don't have to if we are willing to chose to follow him.<br>  <br>  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. ~ 1 John 1:9<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son ~ john 3:16-18<br>  <br>  God takes no pleasure in evil or the death of anyone!<br>  Say to them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, O house of Israel?' ~ Ezekiel 33:11<br>  <br>  So two points, one God is actually patient with us because we already deserve to die but He has graciously given us time to chose Him.  That applies to your story as well.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if there was another way to God without the sacrifice of Jesus as some here are suggesting, then Jesus died for nothing.<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.amazingfacts.org/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingfacts.org/Default.aspx</a> for more.

NCRfZRopaa	You might want to ask this in the Astronomy section. There was no "who" when questioning what made the Earth and what made humans. Natural forces are the culprit. Gravity made the Earth when it condensed the material ejected from the star before the Sun. <br>  <br>  We humans were "made" when we had enough mutations from our hominid ancestors to differ as another species. <br>  <br>  As for God being on Earth, all you have is your Bible for answers and nothing else.

Then from his infinite unconsciousness the universe unfolds to evolve consciousness of God's. The first soul to emerge out of evolution and then realize himself as God was Adam who became the Father's son, Jesus. <br>  <br>  The universe didn't start as just empty space but is full of evolving souls in the forms of 7 sub-gaseous states of air, or electrically charged plasma that fill empty space, and is under the control of God's infinite knowledge which is awakening from God's sleep state of unconsciousness. That knowledge acts unconsciously to direct the plasma and evolve it to form matter that then goes to form spheres that evolve into solar systems. God unconscious knowledge directs plasma to form matter and then to form systems to give ground for higher forms of life which then keep evolving and stop when the human form is reached. <br>  <br>  The above explanation is a continuous state of creation and evolution that never stops.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	We're basically just cooled down stellar matter in an orbit that fortunately allows liquid water.

The fact that he was the father of Jesus does not mean that he ever had to live on earth as Jesus was Immaculately conceived, i.e Mary remained a Virgin yet gave birth to Jesus.<br>  <br>  If you're going the scientific route then there are many theories, one being the dust cloud theory which is explained in more depth here:<br>  <a href="http://geol.queensu.ca/museum/exhibits/archean/archean.html" rel="nofollow">http://geol.queensu.ca/museum/exhibits/a...</a><br>  <br>  None of these scientific theories disprove Religion either, they could merely be suggestions of how a higher power went about creating earth, if that is what you believe.|`|O9WVH9yhaa	There are several ideas of how the earth was created.

Edwin Hubble did confirm this and found that the speeds were increasing which is in keeping with a the big bang theory<br>  Penzias and Wilson got the 1978 Nobel Prize for physics when they identified the universal “hum” caused by the cosmic background of radiation which is the remnant of a primal explosion and in keeping with the big bang theory<br>  Now we can see much further to the edges of the universe it is clear that the universe at the edges is a lot different to that in the centre having quasars and other bright objects which again suggests the expanding debris from an explosion<br>  The big bang theory also provides a connection between particle physics (the very small)  and cosmology (the very big)<br>  That there was a big bang cant be proved as nobody was there to see it but it is the best theory based on those facts. However nobody knows what happened before that but if it happened the we must presume that before that there was no space and no time.|`|hmU2udmRaa	you can't prove anything outside mathematics.  you can only give supporting evidence for why something happened.  the goal in science is to disprove hypotheses.|`|WbaN6osZaa	We don't have access to knowledge of anything outside of our own universe...but I think it more likely that there is a mulitiverse or ominiverse etc...|`|JseyoIfLaa	Well if all the matter was in one place then the universe hardly came from nothing. According to quantum theory and string theory, all the strings are connected to a membrane which runs throughout the universe. There is another theory called m theory in which these membranes cause universes to be created by colliding with each other. It's a very complicated interesting and elegant theory. Universes are being spawned by other universes all the time. We are standing right next to another universe and we can't detect it. In quantum theory there are an infinite number of universes.<br>  <br>  The difference is these theories are backed up with advanced mathematics.

And that is what existence is, timeless, all possiility is in one moment, and as they say there was "nothing" before the big bang, define nothing...<br>  Who can define nothing, nothing is the lack of something, but you have to question how this big bang popped out of nowhere... it seems ridiculous so it seems everything just always "IS" but we cannot comprehend it...

To love God with all our hearts, soul and mind and to love our neighbor as our self.  If you obey these two laws you will be obeying the ten.|`|7P3TSjaZaa	Faith in Jesus Christ leads you to desire to change your life for the better. As you study the gospel, you will recognize that you have sinned, or acted against the will and teachings of God. Through repentance, the second principle of the gospel, you change thoughts, desires, habits, and actions that are not in harmony with God’s teachings. He promises that when you repent, He will forgive your sins. <br>  To repent, you: <br>  Recognize that you have sinned and feel sincere sorrow for what you have done. Stop sinning and strive never to commit sin again. Confess your sins to the Lord and ask for forgiveness. If you have sinned against another person, you must ask that person for forgiveness. Make restitution. You should do everything in your power to correct any problems your actions may have caused. Keep the commandments. Obeying God’s commandments brings the power of the gospel into your life and gives you strength to abandon your sins. Keeping the commandments includes giving service, forgiving others, and attending Church meetings. Acknowledge the Savior. The most important part of repentance is the realization that forgiveness comes because of Jesus Christ. The Savior suffered for your sins so they can be put behind you, even the serious ones. Cultivating a spirit of forgiveness in your home will help you find peace, comfort, and joy. When a spouse or other family member hurts your feelings, try not to hold a grudge. Remembering the wrong every time you become frustrated or upset with them can be very damaging to your marriage and family. Everyone makes mistakes and all of us need forgiveness. Jesus Christ taught that if we want to be forgiven of our wrongs, we must forgive others ( Matthew 18:21–35). <br>  Even after you have accepted Christ and repented of your sins, you may fall short and sin again. You should continually try to correct these transgressions. In addition, you should continually strive to develop Christlike qualities, to grow in knowledge, and to serve more effectively. As you learn more about what the Savior expects of you, you will want to show your love by obeying Him. Thus, as you repent daily, you will find that your life will change and improve. <br>  Repentance requires changes. It requires an increased commitment to live according to God’s will. As you change, you will recognize that you are a child of God and that you need not continue making the same mistakes. If you sincerely repent, your desire to follow God will grow stronger and deeper. You will feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in your life, and guilt and sorrow will be swept away, allowing you to feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. When you pass from this life and are fully repentant, you will be more prepared to live with your Heavenly Father and His Son. Heavenly Father wants you to be happy and knows that sin makes you unhappy and brings unhappiness to those you love, for “wickedness never was happiness” ( Alma 41:10).|`|GSCD9vq3aa	Yes, just becuase you are forgiven doesn't mean you can now take advantage of that, if you do something without thinking your forgiven, but doing it knowingly will get you severely punished, that's only for humans who break the law without knowingly doing it.|`|AA11156135	The 10 commandments were given to the Hebrews.<br>  <br>  While it's a guide for Christians, - it's still morphed into Christian dogma.

Yet they are busy worshipping them. If you remove the idols eyes, nose, mouth and ears they are left with stones!!<br>  This famous story comes to mind. Enjoy!<br>  In the days of mighty King Nimrod, there lived in Mesopotamia a young man named Abraham. Now, Abraham’s father was an idol maker named Azar, who carved the wooden gods worshiped by his people. But Abraham was a believer in the one God, and not in the gods made by hand.<br>  Azar would send Abraham and his other sons to sell his idols in the marketplace. But Abraham would call to the passersby, “Who’ll buy my idols? They won’t help you and they can’t hurt you! Who’ll buy my idols?”<br>  Then Abraham would mock the gods of wood. He would take them to the river, push their faces into the water, and command them, “Drink! Drink!”<br>  At last Abraham said to his father, “How can you worship what doesn’t see or hear or do you any good?”<br>  Azar replied, “Dare you deny the gods of our people? Get out of my sight!”<br>  “May God forgive you,” said Abraham. “No more will I live with you and your idols.” And he left the house of his father.<br>  Now, the time came for one of the festivals of that town. The people gathered in their temple and placed offerings of food before their gods.<br>  Abraham walked among them, saying, “What are you worshiping? Do these idols hear when you call them? Can they help you or hurt you?”<br>  But their only reply was, “It is the way of our forefathers.”<br>  “I am sick of your gods!” declared Abraham. “Truly I am their enemy.”<br>  When the people had gone out, Abraham took some of the food and held it up to the idols. “Why don’t you eat?” he mocked them. “Aren’t you hungry? Speak to me!” And he slapped their faces.<br>  Then Abraham took an ax and chopped the idols to pieces—all except the largest idol, the chief god of the people. And he tied the ax to the hand of that idol.<br>  When the people returned, they were shocked to find their gods broken up and scattered about the temple. Then they remembered how Abraham had spoken, and they sent for him.<br>  “Abraham,” said the head man, “was it you who did this?”<br>  “Surely it was someone!” he replied. “Their chief stands there with an ax in his hand. Perhaps he grew jealous and destroyed the rest. But why don’t you just ask him?”<br>  The head man said, “You know they neither strike nor speak.”<br>  “Then why worship gods that you make?” demanded Abraham. “Worship instead the Maker of all!”<br>  But few of the people would listen. Abraham was seized and brought to King Nimrod for punishment.<br>  When Nimrod had heard the accusers, he turned to Abraham. “Who is this mighty God you spoke of?”<br>  “He it is Who gives life and death,” answered Abraham.<br>  “But I too give life and death,” said Nimrod. “I pardon a guilty man sentenced to die—then I execute one who is innocent!”<br>  “That is not the way of my Lord,” said Abraham. “But listen to this: Each morning, my Lord brings the sun up in the east. Can you make it rise in the west?”<br>  Then Nimrod grew angry. He had a great fire built, and he ordered Abraham to be tied up and thrown into it. But the fire only burnt away the ropes, and they saw Abraham sitting peacefully among the flames. Beside him was an angel in Abraham’s likeness, comforting and protecting him.|`|AA10266519	Yes, by all means!

Try taking one of 'them' away from a kid!!|`|9apjRRsRaa	I am not attempting to sound cocky about this, but I am just simply sure about my answer. <br>  <br>  Yes, idol worshipping is going on everywhere.<br>  <br>  Example: in the Old Testament, men often sacrificed their first born son to the god Molech by throwing him into a searing hot bowl and watching him burn to death (now you know one reason why the Israelites were commanded to kill these tribes). The man was supposed to receive prosperity in exchange. Today, people sacrifice their children to the same spirit, just without burning them physically. People give their children completely to some cause with the sole intention of monetary prosperity. Natives still sacrifice to gods in fear of their crops being destroyed, though it is not sacrifice to the supreme "God" who made everything (yes they have names for the Creator God and the god who destroys crops).<br>  <br>  Another Old Testament god, Ashteroth, was the god of lust. Do I need to say anything about that god being worshipped today?<br>  <br>  Yes, there are many idols being worshipped today.|`|ca3cde249db0aeb29f6850a36707a1deaa	Yes in the Indian population there very much is...Indian many India, Look up the hinduism, seisk, religion|`|8cE7LFPDaa	absolutely!  Money, cars, you name it.|`|mggll8dRaa	All over the U.S., The SUV is the New god......!!|`|KXQVRQdjaa	I think idol worship is a misnomer to begin with.  I seriously doubt any culture in history has actually worshiped things.  There are statues and paintings that represent the divinities being worshiped.  I think people who use the term are under the impression that people of other religions are capable of understanding symbolic thought.  It's common for people of "us against the world" faiths to believe that anyone with another religion is a moron.<br>  <br>  You're probably thinking of Pagans.  I'm a Pagan,I've met dozens of Pagans and I've never even met one who worships idols.  <br>  <br>  Don't you have pictures of Jesus.  Same diff, dear.

BevylvVSaa	Most people who are Deaf live in a hearing world and have learned to adjust quite admirably. Even those who are stridently Deaf and do not speak in English ever still usually are able to lip/speech read to some extent.<br>  <br>  Effective communication when it come to the ADA has many possibilities and it depends on the nature of the interaction. If a person's language is primarily ASL there are still a variety of strategies in most situations. Any form of texting whether it be electronic or written is most frequent. Some people benefit by assistive listening and some can lip/speech read. It is only in situations where financial, medical, or other highly sensitive information is being communicated is the use of an interpreter required - and then only when requested with reasonable notice (and there should be a written policy regarding requesting ASL service and the time frame that is reasonable in any medical/finanacial/government entity.) Reasonable depends in part of the geographic area - in a large city 2 days notice may be sufficient, but in a rural area a week or even two weeks might be required.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	pen and paper.  hearing impared people can write.  now with cell phones and electronic pads, they can use that media.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Write notes.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	All you have to do is write it down and let them read and they will write you back.<br>  But I do like to add something else.<br>  I am deaf and born that way.<br>  I don't understand people sometime when they asked " How can we communicate with deaf people?" , this is why we have pencils and papers to write it down if you don't know any sign language.<br>  My biggest problem is that I have meet many hearing people who are illiterate is the biggest problem right now in America. I am not saying all hearing people can't read. But lot of them do!<br>  I have seen my own eyes but those people who are illiterate are not disabled people. <br>  That part is sad to know that facts.<br>  I do like to add some more, I have see so many people who want to learn sign language but most of them don't make it because they can not understand American Sign Language. Because your writing is English , for an example: People who are not deaf they talk like this ( We are going to the town) but when deaf people sign we said (We go town) but it is impossible for hearing people to understand our ASL. <br>  If you don't understand sign language , all you have to do is grab the paper and write it down and you will be alright.|`|AA10671142	years ago I had a friend that was deaf and we would write notes back and forth because I don't know sign language. when I would call a friend who is deaf, he has a phone that an translator would tell him what I said and the translator would tell me what he said also. it is called videophone|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	I am deaf women for rest of my life.

It is really a beautiful language - it's like painting pictures in the air with your hands.  The spoken language is verbal imagery - sign language takes that a step further.  It is only difficult to understand when it is on paper.  If you get the chance, watch someone sign a song or a love story in ASL sometime.  Really.<br>  <br>  The hard part is learning to paint pictures in the air yourself with your hands!|`|3f051d1522659b9e1c4844497c5a4e90aa	i said this before on other questions.

I did not like speaking, because it used to put me off when teachers tried to correct me. I should not have taken it in crisism[spelling] but oh well, and my parents wanted me to go to a hearing school with a deaf unit. I did, it was a hard experience for me to cope with because I had to start speaking. My speech was a bit blur and it did put people off when i tried to talk to them. I am in year 11 now (15 years old) and my speech are almost perfect. I have a lot of friends, and i have great confidence. Many people said I am an outspoken woman which makes me happy!!<br>  <br>  I can still hear, with my cochlear implant (different version of hearing aid, very different I would say) very well.

If someone screams VERY loud, of course i will hear it but just a bit.|`|AS93mYddaa	In high school, I was friends with two dead/hoh students. One, David, was profoundly deaf, and the other, Christine, was hard-of-hearing but didn't rely on her hearing b/c it wasn't reliable.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, David and Christine carried around a notepad and pen (just a small spiral bound notepad and simple pen), and wrote what they wanted to say if they didn't have the translator with them or they were talking to someone who didn't know any signs. They wee both fast writers...I'm sure they had lots of practice.<br>  <br>  In our circle of friends, many of us learned ASL so David and Christine didn't have to write things down, and the English teacher David's Junior year taugh ASL alongside English (optional, but no one said no), and at the end of the year, David gave his final presentation in ASL without a translator and everyone understoond pretty well.<br>  <br>  David and I were good friends, and had a trade-off that he taught me ASL and I tutored him in Algebra, his worst subject. It worked out well, because now I know some signs with which I can teach children...I never did understand the grammar, though *sigh*<br>  <br>  I would assume writing notes would be the primary way for a deaf person to communicate without ASL. Some can talk with some variable amount of clarity, but many don't want to learn that, because it goes against the Deaf community.|`|b46BnmmIaa	Besides writing notes, they can use a TTY or TTD system.

You can use a cauldron for anything, some witches choose to use a cauldron to mix herbs, oils, etc, while others choose to use it only for water.

Ultimately, it's your choice.  Just as an aside, though, we stumbled on an excellent source for cauldrons.  Our local General Store sells these great cast iron dutch ovens in a variety of sizes, and they're just about perfect for our purposes.  They're durable, relatively inexpensive, and we have three of the little buggers.  We keep a real small one (maybe three inches in diameter) as part of our "traveling altar" kit, and have a five inch diameter for our main house altar.  Then we have the "big Mutha" which is 12 inches diameter for our outdoor activities, and amusingly enough, it fits perfectly on the center stone of our stone circle in the back yard.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and Blessed Be!|`|KRbRNKPqaa	Hey i am sorry i am sure i am breaking at least one of your rules to answering your question but please i encourage you to ask and ask away.

Especially if you are making it yourself, you will be more connected with it- and whatever purposes you use it for will be that much more special.

I use a metal one, and my knowledge of safe cooking materials is not so great.  If you can cook with it, you can use it for a cauldron.

All religions should be respected even if we do not agree with them.<br>  2.Everyone has different interpretations of what they read<br>  E.g. Some muslims claim the Quran tells them to go "to war" or in case Jihaad, many muslim terrorists claim they were acting in a name of a "Jihaad" but the Quran does say that no women, children or even plants should be destroyed.<br>  Now tell me, how can they justify themselves with the Quran as back up?<br>  <br>  The Quran says one line, and to a hundred people it will mean  different things, it is not that the Quran is a book of hatred.I am totally against this view.<br>  <br>  You can take a line out of context (definitely):<br>  <br>  E.g.(made up example): You should steal...<br>   Full version: You should steal to feed the poor....<br>  <br>  See the difference? 4 words made this statement, from terrible to not so terrible.<br>  <br>  Ur specifically reffering to that one verse.

It's something you have to figure out yourself. You seem kind of like a psychic vampire. The easily burning skin has nothing to do with vampirism or psychic vampirism. Everyone has the ability to drain other's energy. Psychic vampires actually need this extra energy. Most psychic vampires drain others energy without even knowing it. Do not drain other's energy if you do not need it. You can become addicted to it. You said you were drained before you did it, so you might be a psychic vampire.

sjMIFH9Faa	The term Fundamentalist is not a negative term. It simply means someone who thinks that the Bible should be thought of as literal history. The Bible is the fundamental source of their religion.<br>  <br>  However, because people think Fundamentalists are crazy, it has slowly taken on a negative connotation. So now, many people use Fundamentalist and Fanatic as synonyms, but originally it was a more positive term. <br>  <br>  As a Catholic, I find this very amusing. Sorry, but I do.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	Well I usually call them something else but I'm not allowed to say it here.....*innocent/devious look*|`|DArAz67Caa	I prefer the term bible literalist-----fundamentalist or "fundie" is an offensive and unnecessary term of hate---|`|YsQQ30YJaa	No. I consider it to be a compliment and recognition of a sincere belief structure.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	i don't care what people call me...they called Jesus names.....what makes me any better....to follow Jesus means to go through his joys and pains....|`|EX6seQtiaa	I do not.|`|OhhKRahTaa	cream.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	I prefer to call them fanatics|`|UinOWcMUaa	Nope no objection -- I have a personal realtionship with God..

So they use it incorrectly....but generally, from what those people would mean....yes I am a fundamentalist (and its fine to call me such).<br>  <br>  In my case, in reality, I am very Conservative as to Scripture....but by definition I am not a fundamentalist (and a real fundamentalist would point that out if they knew my particular theology).|`|AsyB1qLyaa	I think I am fundamentalist.

rv2Iy1Y7aa	You are asking for verb forms to be changed into adverbs?  This is not a simple request because verbs do not readily transfer to adverb forms in Latin (or any other language with which I am familiar).  Adjectives do convert to adverbs quite easily in both English and Latin (and many other languages).  <br>  <br>  If you submit your request again, perhaps changing your verb forms to adjective forms, someone here may more easily assist you.

It's difficult not to become angry and insult them back, but this is a good opportunity for you to show them that Catholicism teaches us to love our enemies and do good to them. It may be that you are the only Catholic that they're close enough to observe, and you have the chance to be an ambassador of Christ.<br>  <br>  Like another person suggested, pray for them, love them, and try to let God guide you in your actions toward them. Do as the Blessed Virgin has asked of us, and offer up the unhappiness they cause you for the conversion of sinners.

(not tolerant either) After reading some answers I suppose some of the people answering your question are too.<br>  <br>  A lot of people want tolerance for themselves but won't show any to anyone else. And it's too bad that there are some Catholics like this too.<br>  <br>  So you are all saying that because you don't agree with a religion and you don't like things that members of the church have done this gives people in a school the right to be against people of that religion? Does this also apply to other religions? or just Catholics? Are you all aware of the histories of your own church? (if you have one)|`|9apjRRsRaa	I want to answer your question sincerely, since I think you are asking sincerely.<br>  <br>  First, I firmly believe Catholics can be saved, but so can any other person on the face of the planet. The sign in front of your building basically means nothing. If you are written in the Book of Life, you are okay, if not, you will be cast into the lake of fire (God said it, not me, I am just repeating it). Anyone who repents (turns) of their sins and places their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will be saved (again, He said it not me).<br>  <br>  Now, about the Roman Church. If I may be as frank as possible, it started out as the only established organizational church in the world, the only visible church. Further, the visible church is not the true, biblical church. To God, the real church consists of every child of God on the planet, whether they are a member of any organization. Moving on, the visible church does contain members of the true, spiritual church of God (born-again believers). So if it is muddy by now, I will stir it up a bit more. The visible church, an organized institution, simply contains members of the true church, but also contains unsaved non-believers who think they are children of God, but are blind leaders of the blind (Jesus talks about these kind frequently).<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, history was not kind concerning the Roman church. They went from being a godly organization to murdering people in cold blood who claimed Christ, but would not acknowledge the Roman church as the one true church. This is documented through much of history. But before you anti-Catholics get excited, there were many non-Catholic "Christian" rulers who were just as brutal. The Catholic Church has simply killed millions (and I do mean millions) of people because they would not recognize the Roman church as "THE" church.<br>  <br>  Here is the bottom line. Go to the Bible, reading it every day. Ask God to show you truth, and obey God with whatever He tells you in His Word. If you are honest, and you look at the denomination you belong to against what the Bible says, God will lead you in truth. The truth today, though, is that your average Protestant church is not acting in accordance with the Scriptures either. For every Catholic error, there is a Protestant one, too. Read the entire New Testament, and see if you see any of the following Catholic and Protestant practices taught by God as necessary to salvation or commanded of the believer:<br>  <br>  Mary Worship<br>  Sinner's Prayer<br>  Public Recognition of a New Person as Saved (after a few questions)<br>  One "Yes" Decision to "Accept Christ" Means You Are Saved<br>  Elements Turned into Literal Body and Blood of Christ<br>  Believe Your Leader is Unable to Make an Teaching Error<br>  <br>  Do research of historical documents, don't believe what people say as most are wrong, study the Bible to live by it, pray that God will reveal truth to you and He will; He wants to.|`|9kzby1KCaa	Maybe u should make new friends. Ppl who are willing to accept u. I don't think u should change schools. It is such a drastic decision.

hMzLqR9qaa	Im sorry about you sister. Anyway, i dont wanna judge your sisters friend because i really dont know everything, but i think that she should forgive her. we all make mistakes and true friends forgive eachother no matter what. i understand that her friend felt betrayed and hurt, but just like we get second chances from God, she should have mercy on you sister and give her anothother chance. I would try my best to forget about it but also make it a point to let her know not to lie to me again and to tell her exactly why. i would definitly help her because a friendship isn't worth throwing awa over something silly. Wll, i hope i helped. Good luck with the situation.|`|T4rGYaKYaa	Time heals all wounds - No one can  tell her what to do  it is her choice<br>  <br>  but personally i would never speak   to anyone I do not trust|`|cdFqekzZaa	If she has a history as a drama queen, perhaps the friend is just showing good judgment in friends.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	Your sister shouldn't have lied.  I don't see the need for her to lie to her best friend.  That's the point of a best friend - to tell them things like this so they can help you.  I don't blame the friend for being upset.  If your sister really wants to continue this friendship, the best thing she can do is to be polite, apologize, and then wait to see if her friend will forgive her.  If she won't, your sister needs to move on.<br>  I'm very sorry to hear about her miscarriage.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	No matter religion, if someone is trying to repent to another it is that persons duty to accept it with their heart.

Perhaps your sister's friend is over-reacting, but perhaps she is still feeling injured by the deception.  An apology does not guarantee forgiveness.  Perhaps the friend doesn't consider chocolate a sufficient demonstration of repentance and reform. Your sister will have to be patient and think of better ways to demonstrate her sincerity and worthiness of trust, or drop it and move on.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	the friend is being dumb and obviously never cared for your sister. pressure and stress added to drama makes for a poor situation where poor judgment can be used. she will be forgiven as she has forgiven. your sister needs to leave her be. she will come around eventually if she ever really cared or valued her friendship.|`|w4EfMCMZaa	i think i would have helped her because the lord wants us to forgive one another.

She is gonna need somebody to help her pray.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	I'd say that your sister's friend is not a very good friend. If she was, she'd be there for her through this hurtful time.|`|OlHFq87waa	Perhaps the friend is right to establish her boundaries. She may merely be teaching your sister that she does not want to waste time and energy on lies in exchange for friendship. or, maybe your sister had a good reason to hold back in telling her ( but why make up lies? )Given that the grandmother passed away at the same time, perhaps the friend will allow for the stress and let things ride. Divulging a pregnancy can be a sensitive issue depending on the exact circumstances.I think the friend should stand by her as your sister just faced 3 major losses - the gma,the baby, the friend. Now is the time for the friend to be there for her,However, If sister repeats the pattern of lying over and over again, the friend will most likely move on.

Sure there are costs involved but things change in high school.<br>  I had people @ prom, that never talked to me the entire year, come up to me and chat with me and we got along great!

I never went to any other ones.|`|2e602393be0dd48f37946385a6bdd5f8aa	I hear your sadness and frustration and hope I can help.<br>  I was in a similar situation. It was a newish school for me, didn't have a secure set of friends, felt like an ugly duckling, etc. I didn't go to my prom. I was too worried about other people and not tuned into what would make ME happy. <br>  I didn't go and I've always regretted it. I have kids now and wish I had a prom story to tell them, even if it was an embarrassing prom story! I wish I had gone!<br>  And when I went to college, I don't know if I bloomed or just became more confident but I constantly had dates. When I ran into guys I knew in school, well, they said they were just too shy to ask me out in highschool and that they felt I was out of their league. And here I thought I was so ugly.<br>  I wish I didn't waste my senior year worrying about how I look or how I would look to people. <br>  Decide what YOU want and do it! <br>  Best wishes!|`|FsHa0D1Jaa	first off, you're NOT ugly! about 90% of women in America think that they're ugly or fat when they're gorgeous! and also, you SHOULD go! don't be afraid to show your true personality. And, who knows? you might find a great guy who will like you for who you are, and not some "fake girl". also, what city do you live in? cause my mom's a make-up artist who could probably do  your make-up for a good price. This year's prom will be your last! don't waste it! trust me, 20 years from now, you'll be saying to yourself, "I wish I'd gone to prom in 12th grade." if those girls ditch you, then just find one of your closer friends to hang out with. it'll be a blast. but only if you choose to make it that way. don't EVER let anyone tell you that you're ugly, or dumb, or anything like that.the truth is, that you are BEAUTIFUL AND SMART! you're how YOU see yourself. not how anyone else sees you! if you don't have a date, thenthen go with your BEST friend. not one og those girls that you hang out with that ditch you. you deserve better thatn that! if a guy asks you out, and you like him (even as a friend) then go for it! but make sure that if you like him as a friend, that you tell him that you're just friends. my mom's name is Monika Anderson and we live in Temecula, California.|`|P0uh2Ckiaa	So don't go.<br>  <br>  I got talked into going to my senior prom with a bunch of girlfriends and it was the most miserably boring waste of time in my entire high school career. Aside from the "mood lighting" and a DJ who thought dance music was synonymous with Billy Ray Cyrus (yes, i'm that old), i got to spend all evening watching the popular kids suck each other's faces and pose like $5 hookers for the "professional" photographer who couldn't find his way around a lit set with a map and a Sherpa guide.<br>  <br>  In retrospect, prom is nothing more than a foreplay session for the beautiful people and a chance to feel even worse about yourself than you already do.<br>  <br>  My advice? Stay home. Order a pizza, watch a flick, paint your nails, and revel in taking a night for yourSELF to make YOU feel better instead of spending it with your immature, judgmental classmates.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Just do what ever girls do, put on a nice dress and go and have a good time.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	just go have fun, and cheer up!|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	You should go and try not to feel self-conscious.

65QqZBnjaa	A hermaphroditic organism is one that has a complete set of both sex organs.  Only animals such as snails and worms can be hermaphrodites. Humans are NOT born with both sets of sex organs, that is a common MYTH. There are people who are born some mixture of male and female tissues though and they are more correctly identified as "Intersex(ed)". There are dozens of intersex conditions. They range from not visible to ambiguous. For example a woman with AIS (androgen insensitivity syndrome) looks completely female. Her AIS may not be discovered until puberty when she fails to menstruate. The reason is she has no female organs (uterus and ovaries) is because she is chromosomally XY. However, her body is insensitive to the effects of testosterone (hence the name AIS) and the estrogen in her body makes her develop that way. It should be noted that everyone has both estrogen and testosterone in their bodies.<br>  <br>  Another important thing to keep in mind is although their bodies may be intersexed these people are NOT a third gender. The vast majority, like everyone else, have firm gender identities. Meaning they have a strong sense of themselves as males or females. AIS women for example strongly identify as female.<br>  <br>  Questions like this seek to marginalize intersex people when in fact they are just people like you and me.  They don't "choose" their gender.  They know their gender the same way you do: They just know.|`|PHulI9apaa	male for the simple reason that females b*tch sooo much!

The West's prejudices towards Islam are a direct result of it's ignorance about the religion. Although I am a Christian, I know many muslims and have good relationships with them. They do not have claws and horns. They are ordinary people like you or me. They love their families, work hard and try to get by the best they can.<br>  Yes there are fundamentalist muslims who have taken their religion to the furthest extreme and in the process warped it beyond recognition. And there are also fundamentalist christians - I give you the Westboro Baptist Church who picket the funerals of US soldiers killed in the Middle East and hold banners saying that the dead soldier is going to burn in hell. These sick people think they are more spiritually correct Christians than anyone else, but they are in fact twisting and desecrating the religion they claim to uphold. <br>  In short, anything taken to extremes is ignorant, dangerous and divisive. Moderate muslims, and christians, do not believe the same things that their fundamentalist name-sakes believe. They are just unfortunate enough to have had their religion hijacked by the evil and the insane. <br>  Wild propaganda and incitement of distrust and prejudice helps no-one. It merely serves to re-inforce the twisted views of the insane few. <br>  If you truly cared, you'd educate yourself.|`|9BeUbORtaa	I agree that Westerners are ill-informed about Islam.

I mean, really, has anybody ever thought to count up the number of white/Christian serial killers and rapists?  There are good people and horrible people in every group.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, I had already learned about about Islam before 9-11, so I know it wasn't to blame.  I studied more after that so I could defend Muslim people against the morons who are cruel to people without doing their homework.  Even though my faith is miles away from the ideas of Islam, I learned good life advice from learning about it.<br>  <br>  It's also notable that the Bible far outranks the Qu'ran in violence and cruelty.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, people will start getting brains and hearts and get educated and become more caring.|`|rXiSWrMBaa	Yes, you're probably right.<br>  But then, Christians haven't been taught the tenets of Islam.<br>  You could just as validly say that Muslims don't understand Christianity. Come on guys, let's hear the bleeding-heart agreement on that one!<br>  Well, do Muslims understand Christianity? Of course not. They haven't been taught the Christian doctrine.<br>  Do Muslims understand Judaism. Unlikely.<br>  Do Muslims understand Buddhism? Probably not.<br>  Do Muslims understand Hinduism? I shouldn't think so.<br>  Do Muslims understand Taoism? You must be joking.<br>  What about Christian Science? No.<br>  Rosicrucianism?

JMOLRKRraa	That is very good question. I don't think there is alot of reliable reference information to differentiate all the class of entities. So some lump them into ghosts. I generally lump into ghosts and demons.<br>  Upon researching this info, although I have not read it, seems Koran might deal more with varying entities.<br>  Ghosts are human spirits of the dead.<br>  Demons are fallen angels, from the light.<br>  Then there are supposedly djinn, made of fire. I have yet to fully determine the difference between the spirit of a djinn and a spirit of a demon, and a spirit of a vampire, versus succubus.  Because in the spirit seems they can assume any shape. They have their real shape, then an assumed shape.<br>  Fairies seem to be faires, unicorns and dragons obvious and assume known images.<br>  But spirits posing in human form are harder to ID. Then the entites might be part animal forms, shapeshifters. And there are good and evil in all groups. I don't know of any evil unicorns though.<br>  God being a jealous God wants humans to just speak with Him. And God uses the more powerful angels entites to guardian His beloved man, woman. But there are different classifications of angels; so are the other mentioned, different classifications of demons?<br>  Any entity without a body can be classified as a spirit. It would then take experience, insight, and discernment to determine what level after that.<br>  In flesh, while awake, if senstive, you can feel a demon, by the hate they feel toward humans. you can feel they want to kill you. Unprotected they choke you, you feel uneasy, they get right into your face that close.<br>  I would say for purposes of Japanese Mythology, they classify those that bring misfortune as demons.|`|AA10810835	Like most spiritualistic theories, they use the words 'demon' and 'spirit' to resemble earthbound spiritual entities that usually just wander this planet, or the whole stellar plane (the universe we see), and ether.<br>  Here is a little comparison of the two and the two different mythologies (typical today, and Japanese)'...<br>  A demon is an evil spirit that drains power from other spirits by being nasty to them, - but Japanese mythology discusses them simply as evil spirits who are nasty and play tricks on the good.<br>  A spirit is a normal, but classed as a good on its own, good spirits just wander the Earth, trying to solve what they didn't succeed in life, ready to go onto the next plane, they usually do no harm, but even they can play their tricks against the evil, sometimes even the good (for fun), - Japanese is the same, but with unique qualities.<br>  Understand we have inherited some of the Japanese theories and real qualities ourselves.|`|fpHblEtAaa	a demon is like a devil from hell brought to do much trickery and harm. While spirits are like souls wandering on earth of unfinished business or other things in their mind intending good or evil. I'm half Japanese myself so I love the legends! XD Hope this helps! ;)|`|fqEZyz2faa	In Japanese mythology, a lot of the time the word they actually use is "youkai." There's really no word for it in English, but they are a type of spirit. "Demon" is the common translation, but sometimes "spirit" or "apparition" is also used. However, they aren't always evil (most of them aren't, actually); people just hear the word demon and assume it means evil spirits when that's not actually what they meant.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about youkai, go to youkaimura.org. Most of the information on the actual website is missing right now, but there's a lot of information on the forums. You just have to make an account to see it.<br>  <br>  If youkai were what you were talking about, anyway... I'm sure there are evil spirits and things like that in Japanese mythology too, but youkai are just what I know a lot about. ^_^
46fouwFfaa	I don't really hear anyone talking about either countries. I only hear about South Africa (a lot), Egypt, Kenya, and rarely Ethiopia. Maybe it has something to do with living in Canada. South Africa is well-known because it has a large population of whites and is considered to be one of the few prosperous countries in Africa. Egypt is of course known for its history and pyramids, and Ethiopia is always depicted as a poor and pitiful place. Kenya is known for its safaris and zoos. Somalia is sometimes talked about because of recent pirate activities, Black Hawk Down, its anarchy and rank as one of the most dangerous countries in the world, and its up and coming celebs (K'naan, Ayaan Ali, etc).|`|WUUXLvdnaa	actually south africa is the most well known. they are also hosting the world cup. nelson mandela, quite possibly the most well known african.|`|CZw2Gpbraa	My favorite is Somalia ;]|`|ncdTxID9aa	I love South Africa personally, especially cities like Pretoria, Durban and West Cape, there's plenty others.

L5d1RtSeaa	I don't believe in the whole "God" theory, but I don't believe everything can be answered by science either. Personally, I think God is just something that man created to answer their questions and to give them hope--now, don't get me wrong, that is not a bad thing, but it is a little wussy. On the matter of atheism, I don't believe that everything can be answered by science--at least not with the range of the human mind. <br>  Alas, my final answer is: I don't think we're supposed to know or ever find out, or we'll be "trespassing on God's domain".|`|AA11937917	because we love mysteries, and as we explore them, we have more resources to contemplate even bigger clues.<br>  <br>  atheism and science are not mutually exclusive.

A human can think, "If I want a plant to grow here in a while, maybe I could put the seeds in the ground in a few days, when the weather is better." <br>  <br>  So, like a hammer in search of a nail, when the human mind starts to comprehend the universe, it goes in search of "meaning." <br>  <br>  Your point about our only knowing a tiny, tiny part of the universe is a very good one.

And when I say no one, I'm talking about those who are not battling with severe depression and who are just going through a consciousness dilemma.  <br>  <br>    The point is that you have to measure your potential and then go from there to figure out how to best help others. That is the only way to live. I allow you to also indulge in worldly pleasures from time to time. <br>    <br>    It's very easy to think that ultimately it doesn't matter, but that is rarely the case. And I think part of it is caused by us only advertising those that have made a mark on history, helped masses progress. Yet, there are also those who gave birth to the ones that helped the masses that are rarely talked about. I think you know what I'm getting at here. Make it really simple, and think if you provide your child or anyone else in your life with an environment conductive to increase their potential, they'll get affected and shaped by it and then take it to others that come into their lives. So it goes on and on...in smaller numbers, not in masses but it still matters.|`|d8mJAuz1aa	First, the Bible says that mankind has a problem, and that problem is called sin. Sin is any action or attitude that falls short of God's perfect standard. Every one of us has the problem of sin (Romans 3:23). And the Bible teaches us that there is a consequence to sin - sin separates us from a holy God (Habakkuk 1:13). In fact, the Bible tells us that end result of sin is death (Romans 6:23) and that there is nothing that we ourselves can do to solve the problem of sin. <br>  Second, the Bible says that there is a solution to the problem of sin, and that solution is the person of Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23). The Bible tells us that God loved us so much that he sent Jesus, His only Son, to die in our place (John 3:16). Jesus paid the penalty of your sin so that you would not have to be forever separated from God (I John 4:10). The Bible also tells us that Jesus is the only solution for our sin problem (John 14:6). <br>  Third, the Bible demands a decision. It is not enough to just know about Jesus Christ and His death on the cross for you. You must choose to put your trust in Christ, to receive this free gift of salvation that God offers (John 1:12). <br>  All of us have the problem of sin. There is only one solution to the problem - the person of Jesus Christ and His death on the cross for us. Every one of us must decide... <br>  What will you do with Jesus Christ? <br>  You must make a decision. What are your options? There are only three possible answers to this question: <br>  1. To say yes, to accept God's free gift of salvation by putting your trust in Jesus Christ. <br>  2. To say no, to reject God's offer of salvation. The Bible says that those who make this choice will spend eternity separated from God in a place called Hell. <br>  3. To say maybe, to try to put off the decision to a more convenient time. The Bible does say that God is patient, wanting everyone to come to the point of accepting His gift of salvation (II Peter 3:9). But none of us is promised that we will be here tomorrow, and because of this "x-factor" of death, trying to put off our decision by saying maybe automatically puts us in the "no" category. <br>  So, in reality, there are only two answers to the question, "What will you do with Jesus Christ?" To accept His free gift of salvation or to reject that gift. <br>  Let me ask you, "What have you done with Jesus Christ?" If you have never accepted God's offer of eternal life, I can think of no better time than right now (II Corinthians 6:2). If you would like to say yes to Christ, you can do it right now, wherever you are, whatever you are doing. Join me in our prayer room to talk to Him and invite Him into your life. <br>  The invitation is open - you can accept the gift of salvation and get rid of the sin in your life. It doesn't matter what you're doing or what you've done. The offer is open to everyone. <br>  If you've come this far, you probably realize you're about to make the most important decision of your life. <br>  Jesus said, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." He also said, "whoever comes to me I will never drive away." <br>  So if you ask Him, you will be accepted. <br>  The way believers talk to the Lord is through prayer. Your prayer should be your own, from your own heart to His. If you're not in the habit of praying, though, you may need an example. <br>  An example of such a prayer may go something like this: <br>  Father in Heaven,<br>  I know that I am a sinner<br>  and need forgiveness.<br>  I believe that Your Son Jesus<br>  died in my place,<br>  to pay the penalty for my sin,<br>  and rose again for my salvation.<br>  I want to turn from my sinful ways,<br>  so I now ask you,<br>  Lord Jesus, to come<br>  into my life as my Savior<br>  and my Lord.<br>  In Jesus name I pray, Amen.<br>  The Bible says, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." So if you have asked Him into your life, and believe He died to save you, you are a Christian, bound for Heaven.|`|JoQFqoTSaa	I think the reason 4 living is to feel every emotion and if you want the world to remember you try writing songs you got 1 emotion down already depression|`|OIccr7xiaa	If you are serious and a kind person, don't do that, we need some good left in this world.

Rather, surveys of food and fluid intake on thousands of adults of both genders — analyses of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals — strongly suggest that such large amounts are not needed because the surveyed persons were presumably healthy and certainly not overtly ill. This conclusion is supported by published studies showing that caffeinated drinks (and, to a lesser extent, mild alcoholic beverages like beer) may indeed be counted toward the daily total, as well as by the large body of published experiments that attest to the precision and effectiveness of the osmoregulatory system for maintaining water balance<br>  <br>  sources:<br>  <a href="http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2008/07/wellness-water-8x8-myth.html" rel="nofollow">http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2008...</a><br>  and me

Many people can admit that they are attractive to both sexes, and sex is natural. Don't let judgment hold you back from truly being happy.<br>  <br>  By the way, you ARE young. I think it's ok to consider both sexes and do a little experimenting at this point but don't do anything you may regret or that you aren't sure about.

AA11780840	It always seems awkward.. What is even worse when they are trying to open the door multiple times WHEN it is locked and the still persist in getting the door open... FInally I would clear my throat uuuuu  uhm.... someone is in here I will be out as soon as I can.... After that most women say Oh I am sorry I didn't know that someone was in there..... "The door is locked isn't it....?" She says, Oh well I just thought it was stuck...? or they continue to try to open the door because they are not listening to me.... Duh!! people get a clue.... That is why now I always have one hand on the door and one holding up my drawers because sometimes the women manage to open a LOCKED door... so I am sitting on the commode with my pants down and it is embarrassing.. Also, when I hear a person come into the bathroom I ALWAYS clear my throat loudly so I can let them know I AM in here... Do not bother me.... Whenever,  I go into to a bathroom I bend over to see if I see FEET under the individual stalls, if not then I will try the door... What is so hard about that....??<br>  <br>  Sometimes I just would like to say, "Would you like to come in and give me a hand ?

ljzb6fZBaa	I used to study Buddhist Studies when I was in secondary school. I wasn't a Christian back then. <br>  <br>  From what I have learnt, Buddhism believes in doing good works to gain merit, so that one can be reborn into a better state in the next life. The goal is to keep doing good works and earn enough merits through many lifetimes, until one reaches enlightenment.<br>  <br>  Initially, I thought Buddhism sounds okay since it teaches people to do good. But eventually I realised that it is still about self - the motive for doing good isn't really to help others self-sacrificially because it is ultimately about gaining merit to free oneself from suffering, from the cycle of birth and death.<br>  <br>  Buddhism to me is a philosophy, a way of life. It doesn't fill the emptiness of my heart. I only found the meaning of life and the love of God to fill my heart when I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour in 2002. Without Christ, everything is meaningless, and grasping for the wind.

Desire causes suffering, To stop suffering you have to stop desire. To end desire you have to follow the Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.<br>  <br>  But to end desire is desire in itself. So just by the will of your ego you can't end desire. You can practice the eightfold path, but you will still have your ego, which is the basis of suffering because it is made up of desires. I think it's this realization that the ego cannot end desire because that is another desire for more gratification by ending desire that actually ends desire, but so stay in that realization requires meditation to go beyond the conscious level and make it permanent.|`|5shqstYraa	The Dalai lama with his third eye. the four noble truths are not important<br>  1 suffering exists 2 there is a reason for suffering 3 there is a way to end<br>  suffering 4 the way to end suffering is through the Eightfold path.<br>  this is man made folly|`|AA10554783	I am not a buddhists or a expert on the subject how ever have met many buddhist in Vietnam that were very peaceful people and kind, many protested the war and one set himself on fire in the middle of the streets in saigon. what came of me is there are people of other faiths that are willing to die for what they believe in. it was a shock to me to see this because as Martin L King once said that if a man hasn't found something hes willing to die for he is not fit to live.I found that some thing and so did the buddhist.I respect that man!|`|AA12059478	Rebirth is not a curse.

In broad terms, these truths relate to suffering's (or dukkha's) nature, origin, cessation and the path leading to the cessation. They are among the truths Gautama Buddha is said to have realized during his experience of enlightenment.<br>  <br>  The Four Noble Truths appear many times throughout the most ancient Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon. The early teaching and the traditional understanding in the Theravada is that the four noble truths are an advanced teaching for those who are ready for them. Mahayana Buddhism regards them as a preliminary teaching for people not ready for its own teachings. They are little known in the Far East.<br>  <br>  Some may see "truths" as a mistranslation (one author cites "realities" as a possibly better choice: these are things, not statements, in the original grammar.) However, the original Tibetan Lotsawas (Sanskrit: locchāwa; Tibetan: lo ts'a ba), who studied Sanskrit grammar thoroughly, did translate the term from Sanskrit into Tibetan as "bden pa" which has the full meaning of "truth".|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Life means suffering.<br>  <br>  2. The origin of suffering is attachment.<br>  <br>  3. The cessation of suffering is attainable.<br>  <br>  4. The path to the cessation of suffering.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  1. Life means suffering. <br>  <br>  To live means to suffer, because the human nature is not perfect and neither is the world we live in. During our lifetime, we inevitably have to endure physical suffering such as pain, sickness, injury, tiredness, old age, and eventually death; and we have to endure psychological suffering like sadness, fear, frustration, disappointment, and depression. Although there are different degrees of suffering and there are also positive experiences in life that we perceive as the opposite of suffering, such as ease, comfort and happiness, life in its totality is imperfect and incomplete, because our world is subject to impermanence. This means we are never able to keep permanently what we strive for, and just as happy moments pass by, we ourselves and our loved ones will pass away one day, too.<br>  <br>  2. The origin of suffering is attachment.<br>  <br>  The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, but also ideas, and -in a greater sense- all objects of our perception. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanent things. The reasons for suffering are desire, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity, or in short: craving and clinging. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will necessarily follow. Objects of attachment also include the idea of a "self" which is a delusion, because there is no abiding self. What we call "self" is just an imagined entity, and we are merely a part of the ceaseless becoming of the universe.<br>  <br>  3. The cessation of suffering is attainable.<br>  <br>  The cessation of suffering can be attained through nirodha. Nirodha means the unmaking of sensual craving and conceptual attachment. The third noble truth expresses the idea that suffering can be ended by attaining dispassion. Nirodha extinguishes all forms of clinging and attachment. This means that suffering can be overcome through human activity, simply by removing the cause of suffering. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of Nirvana. Nirvana means freedom from all worries, troubles, complexes, fabrications and ideas. Nirvana is not comprehensible for those who have not attained it.<br>  <br>  4. The path to the cessation of suffering.<br>  <br>  There is a path to the end of suffering - a gradual path of self-improvement, which is described more detailed in the Eightfold Path. It is the middle way between the two extremes of excessive self-indulgence (hedonism) and excessive self-mortification (asceticism); and it leads to the end of the cycle of rebirth. The latter quality discerns it from other paths which are merely "wandering on the wheel of becoming", because these do not have a final object. The path to the end of suffering can extend over many lifetimes, throughout which every individual rebirth is subject to karmic conditioning. Craving, ignorance, delusions, and its effects will disappear gradually, as progress is made on the path.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Nobody put the curse of reincarnation upon us, it is not a 'curse'.

J4W68owgaa	I was a cutter for many, many years and these are some things that helped me quit:<br>  <br>  1. Hold an ice cube in your hand. It burns, but it won't scar you. Squeeze it as hard as you can until it melts.<br>  <br>  2. Journal, journal, journal. Write everything and anything that pops into your head.<br>  <br>  3. Use a washable marker to "cut" where you would normally use a blade. <br>  <br>  4. Crank the music, angry or sad, and just focus on it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, you can do it, it's hard, but you CAN do it.|`|uky2nsh8aa	look at ur scars and then fond something better. stay on here. haha, we need to start our own little group of cutters. lol<br>  it'll be okay though. *gives you big huggies*|`|MhfneF0xaa	Put a rubber band (not ot tight) around wherever you cut.

If so, tell them you're feeling like doing it again, then ask if they could be like a support group for you. Example: You feel like you're going to start cutting, so you get on the phone to one of your friends and ask if you can just talk with them for a while. If they're really your friends, they'll be there for you. If they don't know you used to cut, then maybe you should tell some of your closest friends about it, then ask if they'll be your support group if you get those feelings.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't sound good, there are lots of things you could do to divert your thoughts from cutting. Join school groups that meet after school; volunteer, especially with kids because our kids today are being sadly neglected--the Big Sister's program would be great for you and some kid who is starved for attention; get out of the house--take a long walk or go to the mall and window shop for 2-hours or go to all the clothing stores and try on clothes without buying anything (makes the store people mad, but hey, it's fun; I don't know... there are just a lot of things you could do to divert your thoughts.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't start cutting again.

(There is nothing worse than indifference, whether it be in the courtroom, or in life)  Being human like the rest of us, I would think that both empathy & sympathy would come into play depending on the case itself.

As the two parties debate the question of whether or not<br>  Melos should submit to Athens, it becomes clear that the more urgent question is whether the<br>  words of the Melians, as weak islanders confronting a powerful empire, have any significance at all.<br>  The exchange involves persuasion and deliberation, yet simultaneously undermines the very idea that<br>  dialogue is possible in a world of violent conflict and inequality. The Melians offer a range of<br>  arguments for their independence, citing the importance of honor and pride, and warning the<br>  Athenians that it is in their long term interest to support common norms of justice. The Athenians<br>  make it clear that if they do not submit willingly, Melos will be forced into submission. “[T]he strong<br>  do what they have the power to do,” they argue, “and the weak accept what they have to accept.”<br>  (Thucydides: 402). At the conclusion of the scene, the adult males of Melos are put to death, and the<br>  women and children are enslaved.<br>  The slaughter of the Melians will not appear as the unimaginable barbarism of an ancient era to<br>  anyone who is familiar with twentieth century atrocities. This is one reason the passage remains so<br>  compelling to contemporary readers. A central aspiration of the human rights movement, to prevent<br>  such slaughters and to punish leaders who order them, still appears as a distant dream. Nevertheless,<br>  VOLU M E 5 – 2 0 0 5<br>  72<br>  human rights advocates claim to have developed alternative routes to influence and in recent<br>  decades, institutions and organizations dedicated to investigating human rights abuses have<br>  proliferated rapidly. Were the altercation between the Athenians and the Melians to occur today, it is<br>  likely that a commission of inquiry would be assembled to investigate the potential for violence. A<br>  truth commission might be established to investigate the incident, take testimony from survivors,<br>  and perhaps encourage reconciliation amongst them.<br>  When it is not politically or practically feasible to enforce international law, human rights<br>  advocates have continued to develop tools and institutions designed to investigate political violence.<br>  Human rights organizations have refined their expertise in information gathering and analysis,<br>  incorporating tools of forensic anthropology, DNA matching, oral history, and statistics. The<br>  proliferation of informal tribunals and truth commissions has changed the ways that scholars and<br>  activists alike view the role of human rights investigations. It is now widely argued that investigating<br>  atrocities may have a powerful impact on the character of a state whether or not an effective legal<br>  response is available. Those who champion informal human rights investigations tend to share the<br>  view that the process of investigation is as important as the findings or results. Even where<br>  investigations do not contribute to the prosecution of responsible parties, it is hoped that the<br>  process of examining abuse, repression, or atrocity may allow victims the chance to speak about<br>  their experiences, generate consensus in favor of human rights, and embarrass leaders into changing<br>  their ways.<br>  As scholars and activists devote more attention to the process of investigating political violence,<br>  new debates have taken shape over the question of how such investigations ought to be designed.<br>  Some adopt what might be termed a procedural perspective, which holds that investigations are<br>  most effective when they are dispassionate and scientific, conducted in accordance with neutral<br>  procedures. This is the view adopted by Arthur and Judith Klinghofer in their fascinating book,<br>  International Citizens’ Tribunals: Mobilizing Public Opinion to Advance Human Rights. Others<br>  contend that investigations should be designed in ways that respond to the emotions surrounding<br>  political violence by facilitating a therapeutic processing of painful memories, or by developing a<br>  narrative response to traumatic conflict. Teresa Godwin Phelps makes a novel argument in support<br>  of such an approach in her book, Shattered Voices: Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth<br>  Commissions. These books provide an opportunity to examine some of the complex problems<br>  associated with human rights investigations and to assess diverging views on how they ought to be<br>  conducted. Together, the two books raise a difficult set of questions about how investigations of<br>  political violence are used to promote dialogue in times of repression or in the aftermath of violent<br>  conflict, and how the goal of dialogue relates to the goal of judgment in human rights advocacy.<br>  Citizens’ Tribunals<br>  In April of 1937, the pragmatist philosopher, John|`|y7HD8unTaa	Spend a week visiting court rooms & listening to trials.

qaiYanF2aa	I would choose a 'fantasy' type store - of course, about a leprechaun and what wonderful or terrible thing he did for you or to you.  If you pick fantasy anything in your imagination 'goes'.<br>  <br>  Here is some basic info on Leprechauns that might help you:<br>  In Irish mythology, a leprechaun (Irish: leipreachán) is a type of male faerie said to inhabit the island of Ireland. They are a class of "faerie folk" associated in Irish mythology and folklore, as with all faeries, with the Tuatha Dé Danann and other quasi-historical peoples said to have inhabited Ireland before the arrival of the Celts.<br>  <br>  Leprechauns and other creatures of Irish mythology are often associated with "faerie forts" or "faerie rings" — often the sites of ancient (Celtic or pre-Celtic) earthworks or drumlins.<br>  <br>  Leprechauns usually take the form of old men who enjoy partaking in mischief. Their trade is that of a cobbler or shoemaker. They are said to be very rich, having many treasure crocks buried during war-time.[1] According to legend, if anyone keeps an eye fixed upon one, he cannot escape, but the moment the gaze is withdrawn, he vanishes.<br>  <br>  Leprechauns rarely appear in what would be classed as a folk tale; in almost all cases the interest of these stories centres around a human hero. Stories about leprechauns are generally very brief and generally have local names and scenery attached to them. The tales are usually told conversationally as any other occurrence might be told, whereas there is a certain solemnity about the repetition of a folk-tale proper.<br>  <br>  In most tales and stories leprechauns are depicted as generally harmless creatures who enjoy solitude and live in remote locations, while in others they are depicted as ill-natured and mischievous, with a mind for cunning. Opinion is divided as to if they ever enjoy the company of other spirits. Although rarely seen in social situations, leprechauns are supposedly very well spoken and, if ever spoken to, could make good conversation.<br>  <br>   <br>  A leprechaun is shown crafting shoes in this Engraving made in 1858. In previous years leprechauns had a less homogenised appearance.Among the most popular of beliefs about leprechauns is that they are extremely wealthy and like to hide their gold in secret locations, which can only be revealed if a person were to actually capture and interrogate a leprechaun for its money. Another popular belief is that you may find a leprechaun and his pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.<br>  <br>  Some of the Leprechauns mythical power's include magical control over the intricate workings of the Earth and the materials that reside there i.e. gold, silver... In several Irish myths Leprechauns have a power of hypnotism or trickery that confuses their target, either allowing the Leprechaun to escape or just to play tricks on unsuspecting victims.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here are some hard facts about St Pat's Day that might help you.<br>  Saint Patrick's Day (Irish: Lá ’le Pádraig or Lá Fhéile Pádraig), colloquially St. Paddy's Day or Paddy's Day, is an annual feast day which celebrates Saint Patrick (circa 385–461 AD), one of the patron saints of Ireland, and is generally celebrated on March 17.<br>  <br>  The day is the national holiday of Ireland. It is a bank holiday in Northern Ireland and a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland and Montserrat. In Canada, Great Britain, Australia, the United States and New Zealand, it is widely celebrated but is not an official holiday. [1]<br>  <br>  It became a feast day in the Roman Catholic Church due to the influence of the Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding[2] in the early part of the 17th century, and is a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. The feast day usually falls during Lent; if it falls on a Friday of Lent (unless it is Good Friday), the obligation to abstain from eating meat can be lifted by the local bishop. The date of the feast is occasionally, yet controversially, moved by church authorities when March 17 falls during Holy Week; this happened in 1940 when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on April 3 in order to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and happened again in 2008, having been observed on 15 March.[3] [4]<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you get your imagination going!!

AA12203324	Sure, the Vatican has all sorts of "secret" documents, like the "Donation of Constantine", which was found to be a crude, medieval forgery.  The main reason the Vatican Library is so inaccessible is that many of its treasures are ready to collapse into dust because effective text preservation methods have only recently been understood.  It would be much easier for the average European citizen to destroy an ancient manuscript than to read or understand it.  And the cataloguing system is, frankly, from the First Millennium.  Even the Vatican doesn't really know what all it has.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	1) Vatican is a sovereign nation, with a Seat on the United Nations Council.  So the EU doesn't have any power over it. <br>  <br>  2) The Catholic church, which holds the Vatican as its center, is an international organization. The Catholic church itself, transcends international borders. <br>  <br>  3) The archives are already open to scholars, christian and non-christian alike, already, so I'm not sure where this stems from.  Is the EU alleging that it is hindering legitimate historical research and trying to pass a law to change the access the Vatican gives the academic community?  or open it to the general public? -- I'm not sure where this stems from, maybe a news article might help.  Many of less rare and delicate documents ARE open to the general public,  but I know that some are only open to scholars because they are rare and very fragile.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	1) The Vatican is a separate country, not in the EU, and so is not subject to EU directives.<br>  <br>  2) The EU has no right to force even member states to reveal national archives against their will.<br>  <br>  3) There's probably nothing that exciting in there anyway.

The first being Gerbera Daisies. "The meanings of gerbera daisies stem from those attributed to the general daisy family. These meanings include innocence and purity, and daisies are also a classic symbol of beauty. However, the gerbera variety holds an added meaning of cheerfulness, which stems from the assortment of colors available." This is what I used in my wedding because I felt that my wedding was a cheerful occasion. I also think these flowers are beautiful. I carried orange gerbneras in my wedding but pink are my favorite!<br>  Another flower I chose for my wedding that i can associate with myself is an Orange roses. Orange roses : "The orange rose has mainly come to be regarded as the symbol for desire, enthusiasm and passion. Being a literal mixture of the colors yellow and red, orange roses were often seen as a bridge between the feelings of friendship symbolized by yellow roses, and love associated with red roses. Giving a bouquet of orange roses could be a sign of emerging romantic feelings and the desire to move a relationship beyond the stage of friendship. In addition, they can be an expression of fascination, or a gift to say "I'm proud of you." The association of orange roses with romantic expressions is fitting, considering the obvious connection between the color of fire and the metaphors we associate with it. The orange rose has become the perfect way to symbolize the heat of passion, burning desire and the flames of love. Orange roses have a power to send a message of romance that can rival even the red rose!"<br>  Another Favorite of mine is a pink rose because it often is associated with grace, elegance, and joyfullness. <br>  Grace, elegance, enthusaism, passion, cheerfullness and love are all quailites I posses.|`|y7HD8unTaa	Not really.

HE will completely burn all wickedness in his wrath. <br>  <br>   8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 9 "I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you 10 and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth. 11 I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."|`|JCGtfNeTaa	To purify the earth.

You see sin had spread out so much that people had no more morals (they had sex in the streets and did so many bad things) and definitely no fear of God what so ever. Now after God destroyed the earth with water it was also going to be the end of human kind, but Noah touched God's heart and God had mercy upon Humans and let them live. There for he created a pact with man (which was symbolized by the rainbow) that he would never destroy the earth ever again with water.<br>  <br>  Now as time passes by we are seeing the whole story happen al over again. Sin is spreading out all over the world and people are loosing their morals even more every day. But there is only one difference this time that Human kind do have a hope which is salvation through Jesus Christ. And so that his promise for all his followers is complete the world must come to an end not to destroy us, but to give us eternal life.<br>  <br>  I know it might not mean much to you, but that is why the earth will have to be destroyed with fire and not with water. and yes God did created all plants and trees and so on, but we his children are far much more important to him and he will do what he needs to do to give us life.<br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|piBBg34kaa	1) He promised in Genesis not to destroy the earth by flood again.<br>  2) The church of the living God (bride of Christ) will be raptured, and I guess the earth will end up being like Sodom and Gomorrah and be destroyed by fire.|`|entRyNolaa	death does not exist in God's realm, God let us create our own destiny, and we have socially decided death is bad, so most of us flee from it...Oh.....the horror ...the horror!!|`|JI1chuBQaa	God likes Bar B Que perhaps?|`|SgqbHP8Vaa	it is true only non-believers of christ will burn, the believers will be in heaven.

Throughout history we have seen that before people can comfortably kill other people, they must dehumanize them first.  We've seen it with Asians, Blacks, Vietnamese, Jews, etc.<br>  <br>  2. Humans rarely if ever simply disagree with others.  They are wont to mock, ridicule, belittle, etc.  Aristotle identified it as an ad hominem abusive attack.  (Pssst!  It's a fallacious argument, but that doesn't stop people from using it!)<br>  <br>  3. I would submit to you that the left (liberals) are far worse about this than the right.

The attack that Christians are stupid is not based on ANYTHING other than such an ad hominem attack.

However, I guess these extermely smart people are as close to figuring out the great questions of the universe and cannot get past a point...I could easily understand a scientists'  next logical step being there has got to be something we cannot even begin to understand, because I can figure anything out, and I cant figure how or why this works this way.<br>  <br>  I will say that there is absolutely a correlation that if you are less educated, there is a higher possibility that you will believe. Taht does not mean that if you beleive you are uneducated. <br>  I am sure it also depends on which schools you go to, and what your home life is like. Do your parents press their beliefs on you...or are your parents absent and dont care, so you run towards the open arms of the church and god.<br>  I think that would be a great survey to do, if it has not already been done...correlation between education level/IQ???....what your parents beleived and whether they impressed those upon you...going to private or public schools. So many things go into it...hell, a large decider in what religion you will believe is where you are born.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Well, it depends entirely on both the religion and the person.  People say that because they are under the mistaken impression that everyone who has a religion turns a blind eye to anything that doesn't agree with them, or blindly follows dogma without ever asking questions.  They dismiss science without even learning about it because someone tells them to.  Those people may be less educated.  But they aren't representative of theists or religious/spiritual people.  Many religions encourage critical thinking, learning, and discussing ideas that don't mesh with their own.  And there are many people in traditionally dogmatic religions that go against the meaningless rules, while keeping the basic faith structure, which is usually just about being a good person, not following ancient rules.  There are religious people that read everything that falls under their eyes, even if it conflicts with their beliefs.  There are skeptical religious people who insist on experience and learning before they believe something.  A lot of religious people are ravenous learners who soak up everything they can and think critically about all of it.<br>  <br>  Those people should not be lumped with the dunderheads who attack with their holy books instead of reading them.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	One of the stumbling blocks that keeps people from the simple truth of salvation is their pride in their own supposed "intellect".  One has to humble themselves to understand they are a sinner, and need salvation.  Hard to do when you're puffed up.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	They may be highly educated when it comes to their jobs or their families, but as far as participating in further research regarding physics, man's origin as well as other opinions about divinity or the Universe, most seem to have closed that educational door for good and become upset when others wish to explore it further, religious or not.  <br>  <br>  Some refer to it as being led astry by a 'devil.'  That has become a very convenient excuse sadly.  No offense.<br>  <br>  Also, religion keeps the human mind and mental capacity in bondage.  It is extremely limited in its thinking.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	See Psalm 14 and find out what it says about the non-believers or the atheists.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Being on this site for long enough, you begin to see the pattern...<br>  <br>  But I agree, not all religious people are like that.|`|YupMCYHlaa	In the US we have a very unfortunate tradition of anti-intellectualism.  We don't trust people who seem too bright, who know more than we do.  You can really see this in elections, candidates always try not to look too intelligent, more like 'just plain folks'.<br>  <br>  Culture serves religion and vice versa.  The same streak of anti-intellectualism runs in American Christianity as in the general culture.  Not all Christians are anti-intellectual, or ignorant, or uneducated.  But the ones who are are much more vocal and more visible.<br>  <br>  Your bio professor, does he believe in evolution?  8^)  I'm sure if you asked him, he'd be able to say that evolution doesn't necessarily contradict Christian teachings.  MOST Christians believe in evolution, especially anyone involved in the 'life sciences', because evolution has become the basis of all the life sciences!  But ask a question about that here, or in a fundamentalist church, and you won't find many Christians who defend evolution.  And if they do they keep quiet.  Most of the answers you get are from the more anti-intellectual Christians who fight for creationism.|`|9c3d57b781184db8448192ff51aafff6aa	I am an agnostic and think that organized religion is at best a waste of my time, but I do not disrespect those who are religious as being stupid or uneducated.  That is foolish since, as you point out, many highly educated people are religious.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, religion becomes foolishness only when it causes a person to believe and/or do foolish or inhuman things, to make absurd arguments to support their beliefs.  It becomes sinister when people use it to impose their own will or beliefs on others, or allow others to use it to control them.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	Of course there are people who are highly educated who are religious:  Rarely are those people fundamentalist types...and the few who are are the sort of people who refuse to apply their education towards their pet beliefs.  <br>  <br>  The correlation is disturbing, though, and implies a great deal.  The less educated someone is, the more likely they will belong to an evangelical, often fundamentalist or even literalistic denomination.  In extreme cases, you can end up with Dominionism.|`|SSsCOIrqaa	I'd be curious how many of the people that say "religion = a lack of education" have a good education.  I'd have to guess they're just ignorant and like to take cheap shots at people who don't agree with their point of view.

There's nothing wrong believing in a higher to comfort you with hope.<br>  <br>  So, where's the hope that your lord has given you?|`|sPemuE91aa	Ok, after reading your question I am going to pose a question.<br>  <br>  Is Hindu not a form of religion ? Do Hindu people not believe and have faith in their many gods/idols ? <br>  <br>  So now why would your belief in your Higher power be any different.<br>  <br>  However, the word "Religious people" concerns me. I say this because sometime people that are "RELIGIOUS" are zealots, like the pharisee and Sadducee's, those stuck on legalism.<br>  <br>  I also believe that spirituality is something totally different than being religious which can be possibly dangerous, given the right circumstances.<br>  <br>  Many people with no scruples have used religion to manipulate and harm others.<br>  <br>  But my personal belief is that a Spiritually Aware person is always going to be convicted when they have fallen short of what is right. Then that person having the wherewith all to go and correct what needs to be corrected. Whether that be an apology, a handshake, a hug, a kind word whatever. <br>  <br>  I hope that this makes sense and that I have chosen my words well.

SSsCOIrqaa	The media is very much to blame for most of what people believe these days.  Where do you think most people get their information?  What a great tool to brainwash the public and make them think whatever the media presents is true.  Why do you think the economy is in such turmoil these days?  If you can take a few pieces of bone and blow it into a one hour documentary with computer animation and some pseudo-scientist explaining how those bone fragments belonged to an intermediate organism between ape and man or in the evolutionary tree of the modern whale, it sells a lot better than just saying "we found a few bones that might have belonged to some creature that might have possibly been an ancestor to modern whales".  So the media presents it all as fact and people swallow it "hook, line, and sinker" (pun intended).|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Not so much the media itself. I would say it has more to do with the advancements in technology that allow individuals all over the world to have instant access to a great deal of information. It's easier to keep beliefs alive for generation after generation if there is not an outside source of information leaking in. However something like the internet has made it very easy for people to quickly research and find out rather than just believe what they are told by the people around them.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	Partly.  People, though, have to take responsibility for themselves.

In order to keep on the air and making money, they had to compromise standing up for something that not everyone believed in. Or at least that's the way I would imagine it going.

While I have no evidence, I wouldn't be surprised if at least a few people have been helped to turn from religion this way.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	When people are wrong, the first reaction is to blame others.<br>  <br>  Religion is false, and increasingly exposed by science and reason.|`|Yz8Ysagiaa	Absolutely, the school system has just as big of an impact.|`|AA11690436	I don't think the televangelists are helping any, either.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Yes. I'm edging towards non-mainstream religions as others, such as Islam, get a bad reputation. I don't have a problem with any religious groups but I don't want to be killed for my beliefs.<br>  <br>  Though, Religion is a huge cause of unneccesary wars. Where is God when thousands of men are being killed on Omaha Beach?|`|sjMIFH9Faa	The media harbors logical thought? This is what I dont understand about atheists, they claim to be so logical and rational and logical, yet so many make such idiotic claims. I dont care what political party you are, have any of you ever watched CNN or MSNBC or Fox News? Would any of you argue that these media outlets are contributing to the betterment of mankind? Would any of you claim that these channels promote logic or reason?<br>  <br>  What the media does, I think anyway, is overload people with information. Wonderful right? Well unfortunatly, not much of this information is any good. Sadly, and I am guilty of this too, Yahoo Answers is a prime example of this. What percentage of the information on this site is of any value? Im not sure I want to know. <br>  <br>  So the result of all this bad information, is that the good sourses are largely forgotten. I see so many people make outrageous claims about Christanity that are debunked by overwhelming evidence that is available on the internet for free. Sadly, the truth is that so much easier to claim that Christianity is anti-science based upon "pop culture history" than it is to acutally read Summa Theologica and discover that St. Thomas Aquinas was an early user of what would become the Scientific Method. It is easier to believe everything you were told about Galileo in high school than to read his dialogue concerning the two new sciences and figure out what the Pope was actually mad about. <br>  <br>  If you are looking to the media to give you enlightenment, you are going to the McDonalds of information. Its cheap, easy, and shallow.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Partly, but mostly it's the inability of bronze age myth and superstition (superstition bred in ignorance and sustained through fraud and intimidation) to provide meaning and relevance in an information age where authorities cannot impose their preferred religion on the populace.|`|25qUTYLEaa	Yes.

I wouldn't apologize either if I didn't feel I had done anything wrong, regardless of their reaction.<br>  <br>  Just about everything you say, could offend somebody somewhere...|`|mOWyzwubaa	she seems too opinionated,|`|iMplzgBtaa	Her apology would mean nothing if it didn't come from the heart.  I wouldn't want someone to tell me they were sorry for something if they really weren't because it would only be said to placate me and it wouldn't placate me at all.  This is something I continually try to teach my son, that he can't just say I'm sorry to get out of trouble or to make someone feel better, because it needs to come from the heart and be a serious apology.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	er yea...I don't usually apologize unless I've felt that I've done something wrong or if it seems as if I hurt them<br>  <br>  there *are people who only do it for their own relief, and then there are those who apologize for everything<br>  <br>  both are annoying extremes I guess<br>  <br>  :)<br>  peace<br>  Allahu A'lam

Why are they so concerned with our belief in God are they concerned we may die and ?????????<br>  <br>  Why are they even on the Religion & Spirituality area?|`|TQ8AE2jPaa	well why are other people trying to convince us that god does exist? i guess we are all just hypocrites.|`|gkThLcf2aa	Heehee i'm not even gonna pretend to know what that word means. I realized this (the closed minded thing) and opened myself up to another concept, that both can exist at the same time.

But thats just my opinion, not tryin to state that as fact, or trying to preach :)|`|oQx1sjfFaa	For a thousand years the catholic church preached that ub-baptized babies, including those of a spontanious miscarriage, were sent to limbo. This weighed on the hearts of many women who lost children. They suffered because of it. And now wouldn't you know it the church has changed it's stance, saying there isn't even a limbo at all. All that needless suffering. Yes, that is irrational.<br>  <br>  Are you familair with the bible at all? Read it,  there's nothing rational there. That's not proselytizing it's just a fact.|`|qRue8Xdraa	No, it's rational thinking - if people wish to impose their beliefs, then I might as well balance the proselytism with the facts, while the other uses faith.<br>  <br>  Religion simply puts out that you can't think for yourself.<br>  <br>  Rational thinking has no version of mine, it simply is rational thinking as anybody elses rationale.

That is all.|`|htQrkD8waa	no, we are asking you to verify your statements that you use god as an authority for forcine people to act as you want them to.<br>  <br>  stop trying to use religion to dictate law and policy and telling other show to act and welll leave you alone.<br>  <br>  religion is what sticks its nose into science, not the other way around.|`|XTyAMS5yaa	No....if someone asks for my opinion I'll tell them.

Don't go blaming other people for it.|`|f0JLp4hFaa	I was stopped in the street by someone wanting to teach me about God, so I'm just getting even...<br>  <br>  Actually, I think the topic is important.<br>  <br>  Why is the evolution/creation or religion/science argument important?  What does it matter what people believe?<br>  <br>  It's a fair question.  It really only matters when the two come into contradiction.  When a fundamentalist Christian teaches children that Genesis is a scientifically factual account of how the world was formed, then the conflict arises.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why does it matter if a rock is 6,000 years old, or 300,000,000 years old?  It's still a rock.<br>  <br>  It is incredibly important because it is about how we know what we know.  Humans have this amazing gift of intellect that allows them to question themselves and the world around them, and to change their behavior or their environment.  This ability has made us phenomenally adaptable and the most successful species on the planet (if you don't count bacteria as a single species).  <br>  <br>  How do you know not to touch the hot cookpot without wearing an oven mitt?  <br>  1)  authority (your mother) tells you not to; and<br>  2)  it is supported by logic and evidence (you or someone you know has been burned).<br>  <br>  How do you know not to take the first price the used car salesman gives you for the 1998 Taurus?<br>  1)  authority (your father tells you never take the first offer); and<br>  2)  you research, gather evidence from multiple sources, and realize that $30,000 for a 1998 Taurus is too much.<br>  <br>  How do we know bacteria causes many ulcers?<br>  1)  NOT from authority - when the theory first came out, everyone thought stress caused ulcers;<br>  2)  following the evidence, two doctors determined that bacteria was a cause;<br>  3)  they did experiments, explained their findings, published papers;<br>  4)  other people repeated their experiments, got the same answers; and<br>  5)  the opinion of the authorities changed - the scientific community and the world accepted that bacteria can cause ulcers.<br>  <br>  Through this method, of asking questions, seeking answers in systematic ways that reduce the chances that we'll be fooled, either by our own biases or by others, we have progressed human understanding in so many fields.  From the spring of the keys in your keyboard to the fact that your children need never fear smallpox to the fact that women can vote, the steady advance of technology and society has been based on knowledge by constantly questioning our current assumptions and by drawing rational conclusions from the available evidence.<br>  <br>  How do we know the rock is 300,000,000 years old?<br>  1)  geologists tell us it is;<br>  2)  they show us multiple lines of supporting evidence including sedimentary studies, radiometric dating, fossil inclusion, etc.;<br>  3)  other geologists, who are professionally competitive and skeptical, agree with the evidence; and<br>  4)  each of us has the ability to learn the science and the evidence in detail if we wish.<br>  <br>  Why do some think the rock is only 6000 years old?<br>  1)  Authority - Archbishop Ussher and others have interpreted scripture to tell us Biblical Creation happened ~6000 years ago;<br>  <br>  That's it.  We must surrender to authority, with no chance of appeal, no chance of change.  Regardless of what the evidence tells us, we must just give in to this authority and hold back any questions, suppress any doubts, and ignore any evidence to the contrary.  Creationist geologist Kurt Wise puts it very clearly: "As I shared with my professors years ago when I was in college, if all the evidence in the universe turned against creationism, I would be the first to admit it, but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems to indicate.  Here I must stand."   As Professor Wise says, the dogma of creationism forces him to put aside all his training and all the evidence, and deny the very intellect that sets humans apart from all other species.  How does this improve human understanding of anything?<br>  <br>  This kind of thinking is dangerous.  It hurts us economically, because scientific advancement is the greatest engine for prosperity there is.  And it hurts us socially, because improved social understanding between people can ONLY come through the questioning of bias, of tradition, of stereotypes and through embracing our similarities and our differences.<br>  <br>  Look at a similar example:<br>  <br>  Why must some Muslim women wear a burqa?<br>  1)  Authority - Fundamentalist interpretation of Purdah tradition<br>  <br>  Do the facts support the social benefits of the burqa?  We can't even ask that question - it doesn't matter, because the authority is unquestionable, just like Biblical inerrancy or papal infallibility.  <br>  <br>  When you allow a person or institution to declare itself beyond question and without error, you've created a form of monarchy, exactly what the United States was designed to avoid.  When you are forced to ignore the evidence, to deny logic, to be blind to things that are demonstrably true, you've surrendered your greatest gift - your intellect.<br>  <br>  So the age of the rock, the validity of evolution, the age, size and motion of the cosmos - all of these things are symbols of the battle over the meaning of truth, the use or denial of intellect, and the freedom to ask questions.  And what makes it even more important is that the battle is not being fought between leading thinkers in each field, it is being fought with and around our children, in public school boardrooms and classes.  It is being fought not with reason and rationality and logic, but with public relations and lawyers.<br>  <br>  If you surrender your intellect to the PR put out by organizations like Answers in Genesis, you are buying into the PR, into the hype.  You're essentially taking the used car salesman's first offer.<br>  <br>  Some of you may not think this is important.  Some may not even be bothered to read this.  But our collective intellect is the only resource capable of getting this world beyond its current problems, capable of reducing suffering, capable of navigating a safe, prosperous and healthy future from among the many unpleasant possibilities.  So yes, I think the topic of how we use that intellect is just about the most important thing we can discuss.|`|ALYKjSxuaa	I don't tell people that God does not exist.

Ex4Lv68yaa	The only thing that comes to my mind is their upbringing.  Perhaps these folks were raised and 'taught' to accept the whole of Life and not just the parts that pleased them.  This alone invites peace in to one's life automatically.  Duality wasn't their teacher.<br>  <br>  I've noticed that it's the people that have been taught duality while growing up will have issues later on in life. :)  I can't tell you how many families I've observed that were only taught to accept the 'good,'  and to do everything possible to 'avoid' the bad.  That means that they are going to have a problem and see life as being one sided instead of all inclusive.  That is why most turn to drugs etc, because they weren't taught how to come face to face with Life. <br>  <br>  I like to eat the whole cookie, not just the chocolate chips.  :) I learned that 'after' I left religion.  Religion had taught me to ignore and stay away from the secular world at all costs.  This is very harmful teaching.

The first thing is that we simply cannot judge another by the outer trappings that we see/perceive.  We cannot know that one's purpose or journey, nor should we be distracted from our own.  i am sure that you yourself have been misjudged many, many times...how is it possible for anyone to know the "all" of you, including your motivations and your goals.  To judge a book by its cover is to fail to meet the entire contents of the book and perhaps to miss something extraordinary...much like An Nony Mous's story of the simple man.<br>  <br>  i can understand how this question might come up for you, and how its understanding might add to your own expansion.  Yet to maintain your own path is to reflect purposefully on your own circumstance...your personal body, mind, and spirit...and how that supports, neglects, or sabotages your true nature.<br>  <br>  We are both students of ACIM, and know that Love is all there is, even in spite of appearances...and that those who seem to operate in fear and judgment are merely crying out for Love.  No one holds the key to our success in returning to Love as our only operative mode but ourselves.  And forgiveness is the way.<br>  <br>  While it is interesting to ponder the outer circumstances of others, to dissect and label, sort and file into what we think are pertinent observations, still it is all a diversion from our own forgiveness work.  The best use of any observations we make about the outer duality world is to use them to whole and heal that "split" through our dedication to forgiving the unreality we and others see. <br>  <br>  Underneath the veils of separation and difference and lack and limitation lies only Love.  What we "see" in the outer never truly reflects our shared oneness, the Truth of our singularity.  <br>  <br>  A bit of humor:  Since it is Love that makes the world go 'round, i bow to the little gerbil that spends so much time on the wheel...what faith it shows to put so much effort into maintaining Love through its mighty effort to keep the wheel turning.<br>  <br>  i am Sirius|`|iVapI5JPaa	but think about it this way...<br>  <br>  <br>  our inner world mirrors our outer world, but EVERYONE's inner world mirror their outer world.

It just could be that our innner world does mirror our outside world.  Everybody I've asked about free will has not been able to tell me the difference between what is subjective and what is objective.  Maybe they're all part of the same thing, and it's about how we perceive the world.  We all have the capacity to be more loving and better human beings; how much we choose to utilize that capacity can be another matter entirely.  I'm just a beginner at finding out about love, but I can't find anything more powerful, important, interesting or exciting.  That's pretty cool!

Ted Bundy looked like the average Joe but had his own demons to contend with and instead of fighting them, he did what they told him to do.<br>  <br>  This question has much to do with what a woman asked that if she braided her hair would she go to hell because the Word says not to do it. The truth of the matter is as it is written in 1 Peter 3:1-4, it is not the outside that God has much interest in but the inside. He tells us to consider our ways, to examine our hearts and to take the plank out of your own eye before you try to take the speck out of someone else's.<br>  <br>  People try to hide the alter ego and all of those hidden personality defects but the Word will do what it says.

Except of course you let the outer affect the inner.  This leads to chaos, for focus and steadfastness of mind molds your life.  Focus on wholesome things and wholesome things are reflected back to you.<br>  <br>  The simplest thing to say about those whose life you see as "so good" is that this is their path and this is what they need right now to grow.  <br>  <br>  The next simplest thing to say is from their perspective more often then not, some one else has it "so good" (maybe even you) and they do not understand it.<br>  <br>  Also there is much love and many wonderful beings in our world and the energy they create is boundless and often times just shines for any to bask in its "Radiance".<br>  <br>  How do you know if they are attained or not?<br>  <br>  In Buddhist tradition, when a living Buddha passes to the next life, and their spirit leaves their body it is said that many rainbow colored lights are emitted around their body and the event.<br>  <br>  There is this story of an old man who did unskilled labor all of his life.  Many of his neighbors ignored him and did not respect him for he was so quiet and simple.  The children loved him for he told them many beautiful stories and made them puzzles and toys in his spare time.<br>  <br>  In his later years the town suffered from famine and sought high and low for a Buddha to help advise them but no Buddha came...  Finally one night the old man died and the light and energy that was emitted when his spirit left his body was so immense that his entire home was consumed.  The display went on for days.  All of the Buddhist in his town then knew that he was a great sage and was attained as Buddha.  The Buddha that they sought lived right there among them yet they did not see him.<br>  <br>  None asked his council even though his life was lived simply, honestly and lovingly.  He lived all the traits and characteristics of the living Buddha but none noticed. All people knew that they had squandered a great opportunity.  The answer to all of their troubles and woes could have been found in this simple man.

If you are at peace inside you will see peace outside, love inside=love outside.  You can be living in a mud hole and be the happiest person in the world or in paradise and be miserable.  People who take it literally are seeing jealousy and inequality because that is what is in their hearts.  You could easily look at it the other way and weep for the angel with a heart of gold who lives in the mud but you would be weeping for no reason because they are happy and they have learned a most valuable virtue.  <br>  As for some having it seemingly easier in this life than others; first of all we don't know what that person is or has really gone through in their life or lives; second we are here to learn what we need to learn, each person is different and each experience is different.  We can't look at someone else and wish for their life or we will miss the growth that we need in our own life.  Accepting meditation or God doesn't merit instant gratification.  It's just a step on a spiritual path of growth and learning but it's a great step so keep it up.<br>  Peace!

But that trick never works Bullwinkle!<br>  <br>  I have always been an atheist. OK, that is not completely true. I am not an atheist. I am not a believer. I am not an agnostic. I am none of these because the answer to any god's existence is unimportant.<br>  <br>  I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses!<br>  <br>  People ask what would convince me that any god truly exists. While I am not sure, I am certainly open to any tangible evidence. What evidence would convince you that any god does not exist? Do you see the conundrum?<br>  <br>  Bible passages are not evidence of any god's existence to me. This is my standard of proof, not yours. However, if proof were proffered that convinced me any god exists, I would change absolutely nothing in my life or my behavior. EXISTENCE OF GOD(S) DOES NOT MATTER TO ME.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you that your god does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'être?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically grant them nothing in return (that is truly petty).<br>  <br>  Isn't the true purpose of spirituality personal development and growth, not the salvation reward? What type of supreme being needs or wants our devotion? I don't think any g-d would be that shallow. However, the bible says man was formed in g-d's image. Seems to me the holy book has that backwards: g-d was formed in man's image.<br>  <br>  What type of parent would eternally refuse to acknowledge their child or kick them out of heaven -- I mean the parents' house -- for disobedience or refusing to pledge their fealty to mom and dad? Ever hear of unconditional love? Does the g-d of Abraham possess that quality? If so, he would still let people into heaven even if they refused to acknowledge Jesus.<br>  <br>  Why is the concept that one can perform selfless mitzvahs and possess moral values without belief in g-d so difficult for many Christians to comprehend?|`|4KIRr9SNaa	No.<br>  <br>  Atheists think about their religion (or lack thereof) much more than theists do about their own.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	Well, I would call them Agnostic b/c they simply didn't know.

I used to live in a town during a recession in the early 80's, where the manufacturing base of the town collapsed, and the unemployment rate went up to 20%.  In addition to that, there was a large population of Asian "immigrants" (boat people).  Cats and dogs were disappearing left and right, there were regular stories of pet thefts in the paper. One of the culprits that accounted for some of the cats was a Chinese restaurant in the town, they found cat skins in the dumpster and shut the place down. We had eaten at the place many times and were shocked when the story came out in the paper.  They were telling their white customers that it was rabbit, who knows what they told Asian customers, or if they even cared.  I always kept my cat indoors, there was no way I was letting her out of my sight around there.  We are a long way from the end of this recession folks, so watch your pets closely if you love them, I kid you not! I have three kitties now, and never let them out.  If someone gets your kitty, may Ceiling Cat rain ammonia laden kitty litter on the perpetrators!  If they are farming them in China that's one thing, but stealing pets is another.

NOTc1b9saa	Siva, above, has it spot on, exactly in accord with my understanding except that my belief would be that it is the Spiritual body which leaves during sleep and after death, and the Soul who remains detached as our *Higher Self* during our incarnations to Earth..<br>  <br>  Due to the changes being brought about by 2012, which signals the ending of one 26,000 yr period or age and the beginning of the next, (thus the applied phrase about that year, *The End Of the World As We Know It*) our Planet and we, those of us who so choose and let go our fear, are beginning to move from 3D to 5D which will take us out of the cycle of physical karmic rebirth we have experienced up till now, although we will still have a lightened version of our physical form..<br>  <br>  Humanity collectively chose this experience at Soul level during the Harmonic Convergence in the year 1987, changing timelines and thus removing ourselves from the need to experience many of the prophesied negative happenings such as armageddon..The changes to our planet will now happen much more gently and there will be no pole flips or Planet X disasters!..<br>  <br>  That is the reason we are now experiencing change happening on many levels including to our planet, US, our weather, including global warming which is MEANT to be happening, and even to time itself, which is speeding by ever faster due to the fact that in 5D we experience time totally differently to how we do now..That*s also the reason why many people*s short term memories are *disappearing* currently!..<br>  <br>  This change is even behind the current financial meltdown, for the dark have long ruled Earth and the process now underway is the destruction of their financial powerbase, to be immediately replaced with a banking and financial system MUCH more beneficial for us, the masses, unlike now when only the elite, the Illuminati profit and gain..<br>  <br>  So, after a relatively short period of discomfort while the old corrupt system of our society implodes, the new one will arrive which will transform our lives in every way greatly for the better..We wont have to worry about money ever again from that time!..<br>  <br>  In the meantime we are going to see and hear dramatic revelations as to what has REALLY been happening behind the scenes as a result of our previous governments* dark control, aided and abetted by the subservient media..Obama has come to begin that change..Unlike his predecesors, he is of the Light..|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	Reincarnation is the key that unlocks every mystery. It's real. The Earth is filled with many first timers who have no past lives to remember, and who put down the idea of reincarnation as nonsense. Science, however, is just beginning to ponder the possibility and will one day verify its validity.<br>  <br>  "At the time of writing there are three claims in the ESP field which, in my opinion, deserve serious study: ...(3) that young children sometimes report the details of a previous life, which upon checking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about in any way other than reincarnation.

Through this process, we have experiences, learn lessons and evolve spiritually. Finally we graduate from physical birth.<br>  <br>  Longer answer: Carnate means "of flesh," and reincarnate means to "reenter the flesh." Yes, Hindus believe in reincarnation. To us, it explains the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. Life and death are realities for all of us. Hinduism believes that the soul is immortal, that it never dies, but inhabits one body after another on the Earth during its evolutionary journey. Like the caterpillar's transformation into a butterfly, physical death is a most natural transition for the soul, which survives and, guided by karma, continues its long pilgrimage until it is one with God. <br>  <br>  I myself have had many lives before this one and expect to have more. Finally, when I have it all worked out and all the lessons have been learned, I will attain enlightenment and moksha, liberation. This means I will still exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. <br>  <br>  Even modern science is discovering reincarnation. There have been many cases of individuals" remembering their past lives. These have been researched by scientists, psychiatrists and parapsychologists during the past decades and documented in good books and videos. Young children speak of vivid past-life memories, which fade as they grow older, as the veils of individuality shroud the soul's intuitive understanding. Great mystics speak of their past lives as well. So do our ancient scriptures, the Vedas, reveal the reality of reincarnation. Reincarnation is believed in by the Jains and the Sikhs, by the Indians of the Americas, and by the Buddhists, certain Jewish sects, the Pagans and the many indigenous faiths. Even Christianity originally taught reincarnation, but formally renounced it in the twelfth century. It is, in fact, one of the widest held articles of faith on planet Earth. <br>  <br>  Elaboration: At death the soul leaves the physical body. But the soul does not die. It lives on in a subtle body called the astral body. The astral body exists in the nonphysical dimension called the astral plane, which is also the world we are in during our dreams at night when we sleep. Here we continue to have experiences until we are reborn again in another physical body as a baby. Each reincarnating soul chooses a home and a family which can best fulfill its next step of learning and maturation. After many lifetimes of following dharma, the soul is fully matured in love, wisdom and knowledge of God. There is no longer a need for physical birth, for all lessons have been learned, all karmas fulfilled. That soul is then liberated, freed from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Evolution then continues in the more refined spiritual worlds. Similarly, after we graduate from elementary school we never have to go back to the fifth grade. We have gone beyond that level in understanding. Thus, life's ultimate goal is not money, not clothes, not sex, not power, not food or any other of the instinctive needs. These are natural pursuits, but our real purpose on this Earth is to know, to love and to serve God and the Gods. That leads to the rare and priceless objects of life: enlightenment and liberation. This Hindu view of the soul's evolution answers many otherwise bewildering questions, removing the fear of death while giving assurance that each soul is evolving toward the same spiritual destiny, for the Hindu believes that karma and reincarnation are leading every single soul to God Realization. <br>  <br>  _()_|`|aJLXBhoAaa	Not possible. At death the soul goes straight up to Heaven or straight down to Hell and once there the soul will stay there for all eternally.

mFf8CqAraa	It sounds to me like corporate is well aware of this problem. The fact that they are doing nothing about it either means that they are short staffed, they don't trust you or they don't care.<br>  <br>  You actually might seriously want to consider submitting your resignation. There's a bigger picture here that you're not seeing. Your higher ups don't care what you have to say. When they asked you about George, they ignored your input and removed him anyway. When you requested that the lazy security guy not replace him, they ignored you and put him in anyway. And when you reported that he's not doing his job, again they ignored you.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to work for a company who thinks so little of you?<br>  <br>  If you have the authority, you send the employee home for 3 days without pay. On the first day, he's stewing at home mad, on the second day, he's thinking about the unpaid bills and by the third day he's willing to "shape up" to get his job back. Call him on the third day and invite him back to work.

LjsRfaskaa	Atheism is based on the earth sciences, where there is no room for anything other than what they see. If you are truly objective and scientifically orientated, you would recognize the validity of the other sciences such as quantum physics. <br>  <br>  It is just a question of your perspective at the end of the day. If you look only at one aspect that is all you are basing your knowledge on. If you do the eagle, ie rise above to get an overview, more knowledge becomes available to use. If you can do that and put it all together you will come to a much better understanding.<br>  <br>  There is a huge difference in being knowledgeable and being wise. It does not matter how much knowledge you have, if you do not use it with wisdom all the knowledge in the world is useless. On the other hand wisdom does not require that much knowledge to operate at all. <br>  <br>  Thought is energy, there is no denying that. Consciousness can and does exist outside of our bodies. There are too many cases of obe's and reincarnation to decry there is nothing in any of it. <br>  <br>  We do not need a new religion as such, but a more inclusive objective outlook.

Atheism, which doesn't believe in intelligent design of life, doesn't make sense. It doesn't answer the basic question of why and what purpose. You don't exists with your personal sense of self, your ego, your consciousness, etc, that just by chance to evolve out of nothing without a purpose. Why do you want to survive and why do animals run away from humans because we can be a threat to their survival? Why does life want to survive? Because life exists for a purpose which was intelligently designed in everything.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	No, the more we go into the future the more decrepid the mind becomes, the less perfect and the further away from God humans become. <br>  <br>  No organized religion is safe or true really.

Is it not known that centuries ago, people feared our world was flat? Is it not known that those who suffered from serious illness were once  thought of as witches? Is it not understood that the mentally disabled were also once considered to be over taken by the devil and exorcisms were performed by the hundreds? Or how about the laws that were in place yesteryear (Blue Laws to be precise) verse laws that are in use today? Each day that passes we learn newer and better ways to do things. Science is factual. We all know this. Why are some religions accepting of only "some" of what science has brought to us? Why are religions accepting of science when it stares them directly in the face? They certainly see the facts of Cancer. They certainly understand scientific facts involving the ability to create a life inside a woman's body through invitro. They might frown upon it, but facts are facts and it stares religion straight in the face each day when a woman unable to conceive using her own eggs, gives birth to a child using her organs. Its a bit difficult to deny those hard facts. Religion has a way of accepting the things that they want to. People also, by nature, have a difficult time with "change"...who dares to change the "Bible"??Personally, I have recreated my own religion. I grew up Christian...and I do have some sort of faith, but I certainly do not believe in following "rules" that applied centuries ago when it was ok to put a child to death by reason of punishment by a parent. There are so many little "Laws" and "Rules" that people of faith Follow indefinetly and without question...but there are also laws that they ignore now too because of being enlightened by science and just plain man being around long enough to realize what is truth and what is not. Do we have a better way of parenting these days? Certainly do! "Spare the Rod Spoil the Child??" ring a bell? Parents dared to challenge and change those beliefs...some will not budge from how they were brought up (brain washed in essence), others, learning from teh new found information have begun to make great changes in the development of children...It is all linked whether anyone wants to view it that way or not. My new religion?? Its called being human. Having Human decency. Respect for others and so on. Its understnading that there could quite possibly be a "Higher Power", and feelilng like things do seem to work in mysterious ways at times...but to not have the ability to question what we do not know? Religion WAS on the right track, but Man screwed it all up! Really I could go on and on but I do need to stop.|`|UYS8QaS8aa	Religion in general is not accurate save christianity.  the reason being that all other religions are rewritten and rewritten over and over again.

The details are interesting. <br>  <br>  In terms of proclaimed teachings, actually religions tend to evolve or otherwise change over time, along with social mores. A religion based in the typical mores of the Victorian Era would already be out of sync with general mainstream values and probably seem quaint to most people. <br>  <br>  Perhaps some atheists can occasionally appear dogmatic, but atheism is not a religion, but rather a rejection of religion. Consider what factors define and distinguish a particular religion. <br>  <br>  I guess one could create a modern "trinitarian" religion with the Strong Nuclear Force, Gravity, and the Electroweak Force as the faces of the Godhead... but you need some hymns, holidays, rules & rituals, and authority figures to plump it out a bit.  Science is NOT religion, but rather a method of enquiry into the nature of things.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	The answer is no.

373KJjiOaa	I watched it. It does not make any stuff up. It shows footage of Muslims performing certain violent actions and then superimposes verses from the Koran on them.<br>  <br>  The film concentrates on the bad aspects of both the Muslim community and scripture.

I have always been fond of dogs am now developing a fondness for cats, and I have always been facinated with the natural world. With that said, I have never seen an animal display and conclusive evidence suggesting they have the ability to "love" in any human sense. Bottom line is that I love my girlfriend, and in many respects that love comes from an ability to empathize, to put myself in her shoes, to try to feel how she feels. This ability is not present in animal kingdoms. No matter how much you want to say it is, a dog cannot put itself in your shoes and understand how it must feel to lose a loved one in a human sense. <br>  <br>  I have always found it facinating how people who superfically "love" their animals treat the animal different than professionals who know, train, and understand the animal. Horse trainers are a prime example. They don't give the horse birthday and Christmas gifts like many crazy dog owners I know do. They don't chat with the animal and expect that the animal understands what is actually being said, like many crazy dog owners do. In short, these perfessionals who train and take care of these animals dont assume that the animal has a human psychology. To me, its like assuming that a three year old child is just a mini-adult, in truth they have a completly different brain chemistry and anatomy.<br>  <br>  So, although I love my pets dearly, I understand that they biologically lack the human ability to reason, to empathize, and there for, to love. Because of this, I would argue that animals do not have souls. I wont say that these creatures dont have a special role to play as God's beloved creations, I just dont think they have souls. Who knows, maybe we can put a positive spin on this, animals are void of sin because they dont have souls, perhaps every animal is reunited with God after death. Maybe having a soul is just as much as a burdon as it is a blessing, because maybe it carries with it a higher amount of responcibility.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	Concerning souls:<br>  <br>  1) First, they do exist. We have all seen them with our very eyes.<br>  <br>  2) What is a soul? It is written, "And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man BECAME a living soul." Genesis 2:7<br>  <br>  Notice that we were not given a soul. We became a living soul. Body plus Breath of Life equals A Living Soul.<br>  <br>  Every time you look in a mirror, you see a soul. *You* are a soul.<br>  <br>  3) We (and animals) ARE souls. We don't have a soul. Here are a few passages that refers to animals as souls:<br>  <br>  Revelation 16:3 -- And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:21, 24 -- And God proceeded to create the great sea monsters and every living soul that moves about, which the waters swarmed forth according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God got to see that [it was] good.<br>  <br>  Leviticus 24:18 -- And the fatal striker of the soul of a domestic animal should make compensation for it, soul for soul.<br>  <br>  Numbers 31:28 -- And as a tax for Jehovah you must take away from the men of war who went out on the expedition one soul out of five hundred, of humankind and of the herd and of the asses and of the flock.<br>  <br>  4) We die the exact same way that animals do. We have no advantage over animals in death itself. Check out what the Bible says:<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:19 -- For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity.<br>  <br>  <br>  What is the difference between man and beast? We are created in God's image. In the Garden of Eden, God gave mankind the responsibility to care for the garden. And it is mankind that God redeemed from sin.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I don't believe that I have a soul, so why would my pet have one?  They are beings like us.

They are more capable of love than most humans I know!<br>  <br>  There's a story I heard once:  An old man died in an accident with his dog.  He got to the gates of Heaven, and Peter said dogs weren't allowed.  He refused to enter without his beloved friend.  It wouldn't be heaven without him.  If his dog had to suffer for eternity, he would suffer beside him rather than abandon him.  So he passed the gate to heaven.  Then he came to another gate that looked just the same.<br>  <br>  Peter welcomed him and said: this is heaven.  That was hell.  We filter out people who would abandon their best friend for paradise.  Those people don't deserve heaven.

So, hence people reject Christianity and often turn to atheism.<br>  <br>  I would recommend the following short video which shows excellent Islamic values (4 mins)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1668424/what_does_islam_really_teach/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1668424/wh...</a>|`|liGflTmjaa	hi :-)<br>  <br>  if u want to ask anything about islam for any purpose ; just email me :)|`|T4rGYaKYaa	The Most Concise Definition of God:<br>  The most concise definition of God in Islam is given in the four verses of Surah Ikhlas which is Chapter 112 of the Qur’an:<br>  <br>  "Say: He is Allah,<br>  The One and Only.<br>  "Allah, the Eternal, Absolute.<br>  "He begets not, nor is He begotten.<br>  And there is none like unto Him."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 112:1-4]<br>  <br>  The word ‘Assamad’ is difficult to translate. It means ‘absolute existence’, which can be attributed only to Allah (swt), all other existence being temporal or conditional. It also means that Allah (swt) is not dependant on any person or thing, but all persons and things are dependant on Him.<br>  <br>  --In Islam, God is believed to be the only real supreme being, all-powerful and all knowing Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer, and Judge of the universe[1][2] Islam puts a heavy emphasis on the conceptualization of God as strictly singular (tawhid).[3] God is unique (wahid) and inherently one (ahad), all-merciful and omnipotent.[4] According to the Qur'an there are 99 Names of God (al-asma al-husna lit. meaning: "The best names") each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of God.[5][6] All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name.[7] Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are "the Compassionate" (al-rahman) and "the Merciful" (al-rahim).[5][6]<br>  <br>  Creation and ordering of the universe is seen as an act of prime mercy for which all creatures sing God's glories and bear witness to God's unity and lordship. According to the Islamic teachings, God exists without a place.[8] According to the Qur'an, "No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. God is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things" (Qur'an 6:103)[2]<br>  <br>  God in Islam is not only majestic and sovereign, but also a personal God: According to the Qur'an, God is nearer to person than person's jugular vein. God responds to those in need or distress whenever they call. Above all, God guides humanity to the right way, “the holy way§.”[8]<br>  <br>  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- Islam teaches that Allah is the same god worshiped by the members of other Abrahamic religions such as Christianity and Judaism (29:46).[9]<br>  <br>  The word for total surrender, submission, obedience, purity of heart and peace in the Arabic language is "Islam". Those who try to perform these actions are called "MU-slims" [Islam-ERs].<br>  <br>  To a Muslim the whole purpose of life is "ibadah" or worship to the One True Almighty God on Terms and under His Conditions there is a wonderful article here<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie..." rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a>|`|AA12283307	Well I'm a muslim <br>  and personally one great thing I find which is sort of random is that the elders tend to be alive the longest because mosque is everyday which always keeps them up and going and they always get fresh air and celebrations are fun<br>  but you don't need to convert to believe in the same things which most religions do believe in as well(well at least the basics)|`|cPGSRwm2aa	I am not muslim, and I am a Christian, but if there is one thing that I admire about Islam, it is that they are good about following their religion.<br>  They pray, stand up for what they believe in, and some even are willing to kill or die for what they believe in.|`|AA12059478	No one is born an athiest.<br>  We are born tabula rasa, an empty slate.<br>  We learn as we age.<br>  As for your question, I think learning about all faiths is a good way to lean tolerance and understanding at the very least.|`|midmBgJJaa	Beware of Shariah law.

Beat someone up because you can't stand how they are? I stand by what I said, mind your own business and it shouldn't bother you.

AA11946554	I remember reading once that that story is like an ancient Greek story that was found (in Greece). That would explain the reference to there being multiple deities. I've never looked into it but other stories, like the flood story, were copied from other societies (Epic of Gilgamesh-Sumerians), I wouldn't be surprised.<br>  edit: Wikipedia has a bit on 'The Tower of Babel' and says there is a Sumerian story, 'Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta,' that's similar.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	In a way it should be applied to "us".

Bible scholars say that the Pentateuch wasn't written by Moses.  It was written by several authors after the Jews returned to Jerusalem from Babylon.  None of the Gospels were written by the apostles...they were written almost 100 years after Jesus's death.  It's all a FAKE people.|`|DDwecKakaa	this is where they get the whole trinity doctrine from. <br>  Personally I think If I had been alone for eternity I would be calling myself "we" also.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	I have always looked at it as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.|`|5B9su14Oaa	we is the people
BLnXhWoTaa	no.  this panentheist believes everything manifests from the source, and manifestation takes all possible forms.  so all variations are possible.  they can even exist simultaneously.  the perfection of the whole doesn't necessarily imply perfection of all its parts.  the unity of the whole doesn't necessarily imply unity of the various parts.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: A small number of Jews would agree with pantheism.  Most would not in that pantheism denies a conscious creator, rather believing in a creative force that isn't a separate energy or entity.<br>  <br>  Your Sh'ma quote is in error: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is G-d, the Lord is One" - not "all" - "all" implies other energy in additional to the primary energy - that's a concept NOT found in Judaism, Reconstruction Judaism or other branches.  "All" could even be used to imply a trinity or a "holy ghost" - very foreign concepts in Judaism.<br>  <br>  # # #<br>  <br>  Kabbalah does accept pantheism viewpoints.<br>  <br>  The rest of that is in error.  Jews know their Hebrew - it is not "all".  That leaves open interpretation for a trinity, something alien to Judaism and what G-d taught the Jews.|`|KgCUpE5naa	Judaism isn't Pantheism.<br>  Your trolling only makes my PENIS harder!!

71mz0DNJaa	thats interesting. its like with my friend who likes me (lesbian) and hes friends with alot of lesbian or bi girls (that prefer girls) and he likes alot of them. in fact, he told me that if i were straight he'd definately ask me out. im not sure your specific reason, honestly i think it varies, but my friend says that its because he has a lot in common with his les/bi friends and he likes their whole self esteem. not sure if that helped but thats what i know =]|`|A1Dawc5paa	I think you might like lesbians because its easy to make friends with them and that gives you more ground to trust them. You shouldn't be worried though, the right (bi or straight) girl will come along. I wouldn't try to hook up with lesbians if I were you though, it annoys us when guys keep hitting on us.<br>  <br>  Ill tell you my story though, iv been a lesbian for a few years now (I was too young to realize it before) and I can't stand guys, but I met this guy ( my bf of 4months now) and he changed that. I could never be with another guy,  they disgust me, but my bf is the one exeption ill make. So there's hope for you. What I liked about my bf was that he thought I was hot when he met me but he respected that I didn't like guys.. (Then of course I started falling for him, because he respected me so much and he's a sweetheart.).. <br>  <br>  So exeptions happen, just don't tell a lesbian u like her unless you've made a connection/

6q2Uyb1Baa	Real vampires are very different from what most people think of when they think of vampires.  We are not supernatural beings who turn into bats and suck the blood from the living.  We do drink blood, but that may be the only similarity to fictional vampires.  We have family and friends, pets and jobs just like everyone else.  Vampires are just like everyone else, except we need to have a little bit more to live healthily.  <br>  There are two main types of real vampires.  The most well known is the sanguinarian vampire.  Sanguinarians are the vampires that feel the need to drink the blood of others.  I myself am a sanguinarian vampire.  I do drink human blood.  I do not hunt humans in the night to drain them of blood, nor do I kill rats in the sewer to consume their blood.  Sanguinarians only get their blood from WILLING donors.  I drink from my fiancé.  I myself, enjoy sucking blood, so I will use a sterile razor blade  to make a small cut on her arm or her back and I will lap up the blood.  Some vampires use other methods to get their blood.  I do not drink blood every day.  <br>  The other type of vampire is the psychic vampire.  Psychic vampires, I do not know much about, but they feed off the psychic energy that everyone gives off.  They have some way in which they draw peoples energy away from them and into their bodies.  <br>  We cannot turn someone into a vampire.  You have to be born a vampire.  No one bit me, and I have never bit anyone (aside from my fiancé, in the bedroom *wink wink*).  There is no known way to turn someone, and even if we could, it would be no different from the life a person already lives.  <br>  Vampires are not like story books and movies, however.  Vampires cannot fly (except on an airplane), we do not live forever, we do not turn into bats and fly around, we do not fry like a piece of chicken in the sunlight, we do not fear the cross or run for the wind from garlic.  We have reflections and we are in every sense, just like regular people.  We will die if we get shot, just like everyone else, we bleed, we cry, we love, we pray.  We come in every shape, color, size, and age just like everyone else.  There are ugly vampires, and pretty vampires, fat and thin vampires, black and white vampires, old and young vampires, Christian and Jewish vampires, and gay and straight vampires.  We get colds, and the flu, suffer arthritis and cancer.  We are not immune to any disease.  We have normal jobs.  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand real vampires.  There are many websites that you can find more information.  You can also email me.  I will respond as soon as I can to any questions.  <br>  www.sanguinarius.org<br>  www.slad.net<br>  www.vampirecommunity.com|`|nFT6M7Bnaa	You actually believe Vampires are real wooooow. They might be but i doubt it.|`|DwKYzfjfaa	definately  there are alot of things like that that cant be explained  like ghosts and anyway whose to say they arent real?|`|cc7bb4a1d7aea36d431a0fa34dbdec91aa	No Vampires, its just a made up story like santa.|`|W0qNkROpaa	There are people who do that.  But there are no vampires, as in undead people who have fangs and suck your blood.|`|eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.

jej0Vnudaa	No, English is not derived from Latin.  <br>  <br>  English is a Germanic language.  However, there are many words in English that come from Old French, which is a language descended from Latin.  Also, a lot of technical and scientific words came from Latin.  <br>  <br>  So in short, English is a Germanic language with a large Latin-descended vocabulary.|`|vJwceftYaa	english is an anglo-saxon language massively influenced by the many conquerors of the british isles...first there was the romans(latin), then the vikings(northern languages like norwegian), then in the wars with france(french), and the languages of those who the angles pushed to the hills(the scottish and the welsh are gaelic tribes who originally lived in france and g. britain before the germanic tribes got there). so, it's one big mixture...it's the most known language in the world because it's close to all the languages.|`|uBpx2JDGaa	Latin and English are both branches of the Indo-European language family which also includes Sanskrit and Armenian. Latin has influenced the English language in several ways. During the eighth century especially when Christianity was starting to grow more dominant in England, Latin was the language of education and the language of the Bible translations at the time. Latin has influenced English, but English did not come from Latin, it developed out of Germanic. Modern English also sounds very Latin sometimes because the vocabulary has been heavily influenced by French, which is derived from Latin. This happened due to the Norman conquest of England in 1066 AD. For several centuries French was the language of the ruling class of England.<br>  Hope this helps to clarify!|`|nIIbDKhEaa	No, it's half derived from latin.

21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	One of my 1st full-time jobs was at a cable company. I actually got death threats.  One lady drove in the parking lot very fast & slammed on her brakes inches from the window I was sitting next to.  After getting out from under my desk (we all scrambled for safety) she came in and yelled, next time you cut my cable during my soaps I won't stop the &*^$% car!  I calmly explained to her that we had not received a payment from her in more 3 months & that 3 written notices were sent.  She gave me cash to pay her bill yelled some more regarding reconnection & drove off.  My boss treated us to Happy Hour that night. That was the scariest.

There stories were interlaced together by later writers and editor to create enormous structures. See <a href="http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/vulgate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/v...</a> for information on the Vulgate Arthurian Cycle. And what you see there is what you get. There are many adventures, and many themes. One might claim that the theme of the Vulgate Arthurian Cycle is the prowess of Lancelot and his rise and downfall.<br>  <br>  But one could not apply such a theme to an imaginary work including all the tales of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.<br>  <br>  First decide exactly what you mean by “theme” and exactly what works you are considering.

It's hard to live up to a list one can't read.  By illustrating a sin with a (presumably) similarly-behaving animal, one could associate the image with the sin and thereby instruct with pictures (one big reason why churches had stained glass windows).  The colors were additional emphasis, based on a sense of the levels of emotional passion in various colors (reddish = more carnal, bluish = more self-absorbed).|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Yes, the LDS are putting out every written letter and word spoken by Joseph Smith, the first volume is out.

Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|959YXUWYaa	It will probably be painful, and you should take it very slowly.

I figure prick works because it has a convenient rhyme and the same anatomical synecdoche. "zack!" is like "chop, chop!" or "quick!" It's probably not coincidental that Zacken also means "spike", "nail", "prong."|`|wwzej6rvaa	Cheers bastard, on the skirt, look sharp!|`|a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	It has something to do with your scrotum ("sack")...|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Cheers you sod, a toast to the womenfolk, quick, quick, quick!

38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	It varies from trip to trip. I used to take the Greyhound home over holiday breaks when I was in college, and things ranged from boring to very interesting to downright annoying.<br>  <br>  For example, on one trip I had to sit behind a woman who whined before every stop. "I wonder if they'll have any WATTA (water) at this station?" Four hours of that annoying nasal voice was almost enough to send the rest of us over the edge. I don't know if she thought she was going to dry up and blow away if each bus station didn't have a water fountain for her to refill her water bottle or what. <br>  <br>  Then there was the Christmas trip one year when the only empty seat left happened to be by me. A big guy got on right before the bus pulled out and plopped down beside me. All the way from St. Louis to Springfield, Illinois he told me his entire life story. He was a half-Cherokee ex-Marine turned ex-convict after his hitch in the military was over. He'd just gotten out of prison for manslaughter. . .and yes, I heard all about his drug use, the guy he killed, and the interesting recreational activities he and his Marine buddies used to do.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, that was an interesting ride. . .one that I was glad to see come to an end!<br>  <br>  And other trips were quiet to the point of being almost boring. (After the ex-Marine, I learned to appreciate boring in a way that I never had before.) It just depends on your fellow passengers and how good your nerves are.|`|AA12095483	Hard to predict. Usually, it's just a long bus ride. Greyhounds are fairly comfortable, as buses go. Sometimes you get an interesting seat companion, sometimes you don't. Take a good book to read, a bottle of water to drink and whatever you want for a snack.|`|ytQfxuPyaa	Grehounds are good racing dogs, but not very strong, so I would recommend travelling on something larger.|`|6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	I've taken a few trips on a Greyhound when I was younger, and it wasn't bad.  But I was never on a crowded bus, There were always enough seats that you could ignore everyone else.  It's better for shorter trips ... longer trips get really boring no matter how many books or games you bring.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	The other passengers change with every trip.  Sometimes you are lucky, other times you are not.  Mostly though (and I can only base this on my experience) is that other people are pretty good and keep to themselves.  You can always change seats if you're next to someone rude.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	I like it . meet some interesting people.  I like when it stops in a small town.   fairly comfortable.  When I am on board for two or three days i bring a blanket and pillow and something to brace my feet  so i can get some sleep.  I also bring bottles of water, crackers and cheese. candy.  never know when the bus breaks down can be a long time.<br>  I have traveled from NYC to San Diego via the greyhound,  Stopped over at the Grand <br>  canyon  i was 22 years old when i went.  Not up to that kind of trip now.|`|j35P3vBwaa	Its not so bad.And as far as the other passengers, that depends on who you're sitting next to.For the most part the Greyhound bus is a smooth ride and you pass plenty of beautiful scenery.<br>  Bring magazines,books,activity books,etc because there is no television.<br>  Only  Coach buses have the televisions.|`|AA11230150	Once many years ago I rode the Greyhound from Halifax to Toronto and for almost a whole day I sat next to a woman who must have weighed over 2 bills and she was sharing her seat with her son.  The two of them spent most of the time singing religious revival-type songs except for when she (after having asked me if I was Catholic or not) took great pains to explain how the Pope is the anti-christ etc, etc.<br>  I felt trapped and I guess I was.<br>  Good luck on your trip.<br>  Oh yeah, her husband was also on the bus, a few rows away...|`|130df77840211884c0142ac3fabd5beeaa	ohhh lol jimmy is a riot..<br>  <br>  greyhounds are nice, i like traveling on buses. well the other passengers are all different...we cannot tell u what the people u will be traveling with are like. it's not a bad experience though, just lay back, read, or listen to some music and enjoy the ride

Why would God let children be abused and neglected? Why would God let there be war? I believe when people ask a lot of these questions they tend to forget that-to those of us who believe- there is a God, and a devil, and a constant fight between the two.|`|X548yCR6aa	Or why do people even get pregnant when it's clear they are in no condition to support a child? If I were God, sex would only result in babies if both people want them.|`|uurTX7POaa	that would just create more cretins like yourself...|`|2e34ws6zaa	Why are you limiting your question?<br>  <br>  Why doesn't He simply close the O-Zone holes to keep us from getting ultraviolet radiation?  Or prevent car crashes from being as fatal... or just prevent them entirely?  Why doesn't God keep us from death?<br>  <br>  Your question and its 'what if' is circular logic and quite silly.|`|rgQiiTgoaa	Dont question my god he works in mysterious ways.  He is reading this now as we speak.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Because God does not make us puppets on a string.  The womb is suppose to be the safest place - however humans in our sins, has made it a very dangerous place for 4,000 babies a day in America alone. Don't blame God for the sins of people.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	I'll tell you the honest truth: The Catholic Church banned abortions to breed more Catholics, it wasn't an act of God.<br>  <br>  I think if God made the womb immune to abortions, it would be wrong. Just think of the children conceived through rape. The woman would still love the child, but it would always remind her of the horror of it's consummation. In that respect: Abortion is right in certain situations.
N1sfHiPkaa	It depends on the specifics.<br>  <br>  "I love your hair" is "Tetszik a hajad" (more literally "your hair pleases me / looks good to me"). This is the most appropriate for any concrete item, like clothing or artwork or belongings. If it's more than one thing, the verb changes: "I like your paintings" is "tetszenek a festményeid". Note that the bit that English expresses with the word "your" is a suffix on the noun in Hungarian, and the form of the suffix depends on the noun: láb-ad, kép-ed, b?r-?d, arc-od. <br>  <br>  "I love your cooking" is "ízlik a f?zt?d" ("your cooking tastes good to me").<br>  <br>  I can't offhand think of a situation where it sounds really idiomatic, but there's also "szeretem a(z) ...", using a form of the "love/like" verb.<br>  <br>  Rough pronunciations: /TET-seek/ (first syllable like 'met' or 'set'), /EEZ-leek/, /SE-re-tem/ (all vowels like 'met' or 'sell'), and "a" is like in 'tall' or 'awe'.
dfa0f10d091f9f82c584408f50df66a8aa	"Great is his glory?"<br>  "Faithful and true?"<br>  "Mingling with Gods?"<br>  "Ever and ever keys he will hold?"<br>  <br>  There are sooooo many things wrong with this song Jesus is the Name above ALL NAMES, GOD'S GLORY IS GREAT, GOD ALONE IS FAITHFUL AND TRUE. JESUS HOLDS THE KEYS TO DEATH AND LIFE.<br>  <br>  What is wrong with these people to not see the blasphemy against Jesus in this song, hymn or not it needs to be burned.<br>  <br>  Father forgive them for they know not what they have done...|`|AA10344836	I know this song. It praises Joseph Smith Jr. The Latter Day Saints believe he ushered in the 7th dispensation of God's Kingdom.|`|0T3weRh5aa	It's just a hymn...

I am no longer affiliated with LDS, but having been raised taught all of this garbage I can tell you that they do not worship joseph smith if that's what your trying to get at. This song is praising him for his service to god and his dedication to restoring the "true church". As for the truth of the LDS doctrine or any religion for that matter, they are all bunk.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	its a beautiful hymn. <br>  <br>  i like a few others even more though.<br>  this song does not implicitly mean anyone LDS actually worships Joseph smith before Jesus. <br>  <br>  but it is like a song of "thanks" for joseph who brought the restored gospel to earth.

That is bad taste for sure. <br>  <br>  I believe a simple clean shirt would not have stirred your subject, no?<br>  <br>  But more important than how we look, in my opinion, is how clean we are; it's our body hygiene that creates a hidden field of attraction between us and the others.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|AA12095483	Whatever for? There's a difference between being a scuzz and needing a shower, and dressing casually.

I know it should not reduce the capability of person to do their job but I can't help how I feel. I think a lot started with the big charity days advertised on TV as in this weeks' UK Red Nose Day as a  special favour on these days employees could go in dressed casually and often had to make a dontation to the cause. It then became 1 day a week dressing down day, usually a Friday and so it went on until now casual is okay. With regard to your experience in the hotel I actually blame the establishment even more than the disgusting individual as hotels normally have the right to turn away anyone they do not wish there. You don't say but perhaps this guy was also big and broad and the staff were afraid of him? Lol|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	Maybe the recession will bring it back.

For another thing, you have take those verses out of context. They are prophetic scriptures given to the people of Israel near the time they were written down in those books. They were prophesies given to warn the people of things to come in the immediate future, of which many if not all of them came to pass. These were given ahead of time to prepare the people to repent, so that God would intervene. As well as to prepare the righteous so they wouldn't be taken by surprise. This is the way God showed his mercy and grace toward his people to give them ample time to repent and change their ways. In many instances they would not repent, and continued to rebel in spite of the prophesies, they would mock, stone and kill the prophets because they brought a message they did not want to hear. Instead they would turn to false prophets, who would only make them feel good about themselves and tell them what they wanted to hear.|`|VLxU5112aa	Jesus wasn't alive when the Bible was written, assuming he was ever alive at all.|`|QUg9W2NGaa	It was a punishment for people  who expended their time worshiping several idols and trying to prove God wrong.

AA12181796	There's a difference between not really seeing where she's coming from with regards to her lack of religious beliefs and actually not accepting her as a person. It sounds like you're doing the former, and so long as you aren't trying to push your beliefs on her, I don't think it's a problem. Of course you don't understand how she doesn't believe what you do - isn't that true of almost any difference in beliefs or interests? She probably doesn't understand how anyone *could* believe in Jesus. So long as neither of you get nasty about it, there's no reason why this should affect your friendship.

Could one of these be the problem?<br>  <br>  1) You don't respect your friend's right to make up her own mind.<br>  <br>  2) You are so uncertain in your own faith that her lack of belief makes you feel threatened?<br>  <br>  3) You have been pressured by others to proselytize your beliefs; and so you feel compelled to push them on your friend?<br>  <br>  4) You have been taught that God is cruel to those who do not believe in Him, and so you're scared for her?<br>  <br>  If you can say none of these describe your situation, then I don't have a clue.<br>  <br>  Good luck, though.|`|3959c9601f288bcc65fe36767a2df0c0aa	"Accept", not except.<br>  <br>  Your dogma is in the way.

Who then impregnated a random Jewish virgin to create a son who would walk around for a number of years saying stuff, and die on a cross to absolve you of everything you'll ever do wrong in advance.<br>  Oh yeah, how can anyone not believe that?

I say to *accept* it but still be her friend. Remember, Jesus encourages unconditional love.

For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." "Therefore come out from them and be separate, says Yahweh. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." "I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says Yahweh Almighty.""<br>  <br>  It's not wrong for you to feel that, you feeling what the Spirit feels, because they're missing out on the Truth, and will miss-out on everlasting life with Yahweh (God), instead they'll return to the grave and perish, ceasing to exist when they die.<br>  <br>  If you want to be friends make sure to keep your relationship in check with Yahshua (Jesus)!

Continue to pray for her. If you are following Christ with the entirety of your heart as the Bible says "If anyone asks anything according to my name I will do it." God will grant the desires of your heart if you are following Him. So stand on that promise. How can He not answer your prayers? This reminds me of a true story about this evangelist who came to my church. He was saying someone, i don't remember who, kept a list of about 50 people who prayed for their salvation every day of his life. Standing on the promises of God. And all of them but one gave their lives to Christ. The last, he did not see, but at his funeral the last one did. Have faith.

I am a disciple of Jesus Christ. I have made covenants with Jesus Christ.  I have faith in Jesus Christ.  I have been saved by Jesus Christ.  I look forward to the return of Jesus Christ.

YES, YES, YES -- Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to salvation.

Technically they add a great deal to the Christian belief system that is clearly not a part of the original and incorporates a great deal of Freemasonry into its symbolism and ritual (beehives, aprons and the symbols on their underwear, anyone?).  I'd classify it as a offshoot, but separate religion.<br>  <br>  Others would, out of ignorance, assume that it was just another Christian denomination.  But then again, the line is fuzzy about where one religion starts and another ends.|`|cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	The only true answer you can get to this question is "yes," because regardless of how many so-called "Christians" want to say otherwise, there are Mormons and non-Mormons alike who do consider the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to be a Christian religion.  There are those who can and do disagree, and that's their right, but technically even counting their disagreement, Mormons are still considered to be Christians by many people in the world.<br>  It amazes me how anyone who has objectively viewed our religion can disagree, but opinions are like butt holes--everyone's got one and they pretty much all stink.  <br>  Here's the thing.  Basing disagreement of our Christianity on acceptance or non acceptance of Trinity theory (because, really it's not biblical doctrine) also discounts over 300 years of Christians.  The trinity "doctrine" wasn't established until the Council of Nicea met, hundreds of years after Christ's death.  Are all the people who lived before then and believed in and followed Christ therefore not Christian?<br>  Then there are those who base our non-Christianity on our belief in the Book of Mormon.  Is it really so fantastic of an idea that God might follow established pattern and use a prophet to direct and communicate with His people on the Earth?  The idea that everything that needed to be said had been said by two thousand years ago is essentially laughable.  In every dispensation represented in the Bible, the prophets were primarily there to deal with current or near future issues.  They were there to call people to repentance (multiple prophets prior to the destruction of Jerusalem), to warn them of impending disaster(Noah, Jonah, etc), to direct them where God wanted them to go (Moses, Abraham), and a small portion of prophesying about the latter days.  To believe that prophecy is no longer possible implies God is either inconsistent, or that he no longer loves us and no longer wishes to communicate with us.  I simply refuse to believe that.  The God I believe in loves all His children, communicates with us freely as long as we are willing to listen, and wants us to have His guidance.  It defies logic to base someone's Christianity on the fact that they're willing to believe in and listen to the current prophet.<br>  If God can't speak to us, what is the point of prayer?  What does it mean that Revelations speaks of prophets in the last days?  It simply cannot be both ways.  Either prophecy has ended or it has not.  If it has, then the prophecies about prophets in the last days are invalid and false prophecies.  If it has not, the falsehood is in the belief that God no longer provides prophets.  If He does provide prophets, where are they?  Only one religion claims to have a current prophet.  This is something that has been consistent about God's true church since the time of Adam.  Think for yourself and stop listening to propaganda.|`|ApyKiltXaa	Here's their official statement:  <br>  <br>  He was the Great Jehovah of the Old Testament, the Messiah of the New. Under the direction of His Father, He was the creator of the earth. “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made” (John 1:3). Though sinless, He was baptized to fulfill all righteousness. He “went about doing good” (Acts 10:38), yet was despised for it. His gospel was a message of peace and goodwill. He entreated all to follow His example. He walked the roads of Palestine, healing the sick, causing the blind to see, and raising the dead. He taught the truths of eternity, the reality of our premortal existence, the purpose of our life on earth, and the potential for the sons and daughters of God in the life to come. <br>  <br>  He instituted the sacrament as a reminder of His great atoning sacrifice. He was arrested and condemned on spurious charges, convicted to satisfy a mob, and sentenced to die on Calvary’s cross. He gave His life to atone for the sins of all mankind. His was a great vicarious gift in behalf of all who would ever live upon the earth. <br>  <br>  We solemnly testify that His life, which is central to all human history, neither began in Bethlehem nor concluded on Calvary. He was the Firstborn of the Father, the Only Begotten Son in the flesh, the Redeemer of the world. <br>  <br>  He rose from the grave to “become the firstfruits of them that slept” (1 Corinthians 15:20). As Risen Lord, He visited among those He had loved in life. He also ministered among His “other sheep” (John 10:16) in ancient America. In the modern world, He and His Father appeared to the boy Joseph Smith, ushering in the long-promised “dispensation of the fulness of times” (Ephesians 1:10). <br>  <br>  Of the Living Christ, the Prophet Joseph wrote: “His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying: <br>  <br>  “I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father” (D&C 110:3–4). <br>  <br>  Of Him the Prophet also declared: “And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! <br>  <br>  “For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father— <br>  <br>  “That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God” (D&C 76:22–24). <br>  <br>  We declare in words of solemnity that His priesthood and His Church have been restored upon the earth—“built upon the foundation of … apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone” (Ephesians 2:20). <br>  <br>  We testify that He will someday return to earth. “And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together” (Isaiah 40:5). He will rule as King of Kings and reign as Lord of Lords, and every knee shall bend and every tongue shall speak in worship before Him. Each of us will stand to be judged of Him according to our works and the desires of our hearts. <br>  <br>  We bear testimony, as His duly ordained Apostles—that Jesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of God. He is the great King Immanuel, who stands today on the right hand of His Father. He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come. God be thanked for the matchless gift of His divine Son. <br>  <br>  Hmmm.. unless I've missed the official declaration of Christianity....they believe in Jesus Christ too.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	what do you mean are they? according to whom? <br>  <br>  they are christian by definition, as they believe that jesus was the christ.<br>  <br>  the only ones that say mormons are not christians are other christians who think only they have the truth. pathetic.|`|DArAz67Caa	NO-----true Christians do not put other "prophets" before Christ-----<br>  Mormonism is a cult that reeks of Satan and is closer to the muslim faith system than any other religion-----|`|NgL2Onqhaa	In the broad answer that they believe in Jesus Christ they are. <br>  <br>  actually, I do not believe that they consider themselves to be of the same group traditionally titled 'Christian'|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	The official department of decisions considers them Christians.|`|Kg5KX432aa	they like to think they are... but really they have a very different view of Christ and God than your traditional "Christian"
98XPkvSqaa	le/la = THE (le - masc; la - fem)<br>  <br>  un/une = A (un - masc; une - fem)<br>  <br>  Do you want to say A TEE-SHIRT? (un) or THE TEE-SHIRT? (le)|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	le/la = the (masculin and feminine)<br>  un/une = a (masculin and feminine)<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure it's un tee-shirt but it might<br>  depend.<br>  <br>  Like "Elle n'aimait pas le tee-shirt" and "Elle<br>  m'a acheté un tee-shirt" both make sense.|`|rzGL19x8aa	le, un - male french article<br>  la, une - female french article<br>  <br>  commonly "le" and "la" are used when talking about a specific object etc.<br>  So "le tee-shirt" indicates that you are talking about a certain t-shirt - "the t-shirt".<br>  un and une are articles that you use when talking about non-specific things. So "un tee-shirt" means "a t-shirt".|`|EMktqCXgaa	Like the other posters said, it's simply the difference between "the" and "a",<br>  <br>  "le" (masculine) and "la" (feminine) mean "the".<br>  <br>  "un" (masuline) and "une" (feminine) mean "a".<br>  <br>  If the noun starts with a vowel (example: oiseau..meaning bird), you have to change the "le" or "la" to "l' "...for example, l'oiseau. This is to make the words flow together better.<br>  <br>  "The" is known as a definite article while "a" is indefinite, because when you say "the", then you know that the person is talking about something specific, where as when you say "a" it's less specific and less definite. So for the t-shirt question..it just depends on what you want to say. Do you want any random t-shirt (a t-shirt)? or do you want THE t-shirt (like..the specific t-shirt right there on the table)<br>  <br>  examples:<br>  <br>  la pomme (a specific apple)... Je veux la pomme rouge (I want the red apple).. the apple is probably right in front of the person<br>  <br>  une pomme (any random apple ) Je veux une pomme (I want an apple)...the apple is probably not in front of her but she wishes she had one..no matter what kind<br>  <br>  masculine example: <br>  le clochard (a specific hobo)... Regarde le clochard, oh lala sa barbe est genial (Look at the hobo, oh lala his beard is great)...he's probably right in front of the speaker... lala should have two accents and the word genial has an accent too but im too lazy to type it in lol. im on a weird keyboard right now.<br>  <br>  un clochard (any random hobo)... Je veux rencontrer un clochard un jour (I want to meet a hobo one day)... any random hobo will do<br>  <br>  ... and so on.<br>  <br>  when it's plural, masculine and feminine forms are the same. "un" and "une" change to "des" (des pommes...some apples)<br>  <br>  and "le" and "la" change to "les" (les pommes...the apples)

bGdTivxqaa	I will start with ЭТО.  The translation of the word is "THIS" and it is used when this word does not modify any noun, but instead is used all by itself, e.g. This is a book. - Это книга.  or This is a table. - Это стол.  As you can see from the examples, the word THIS is not followed by any noun directly.<br>  <br>  Now the word ЭТОТ is used to modify a noun, which means that it will have a noun following it directly.  It also exists in a couple forms, depending on gender and number of the noun following it: ЭТОТ for masculine, ЭТА for feminine, ЭТО for neuter and ЭТИ for plural, e.g.:<br>  This table is new. - Этот стол новый.<br>  This book is new. - Эта книга новая.<br>  This radio is new. Это радио новое.<br>  These cars are new. - Эти машины новые.<br>  <br>  So if the word THIS in English is used as a modifier and is directly followed by a noun, use ЭТОТ/ЭТА/ЭТО/ЭТИ.|`|WJD3bVH0aa	I'm still a bit of a beginner in Russian, but as far as I know:<br>  <br>  Этот means "this".<br>  Тот means "that".<br>  Это means "it", but can loosely mean this/that. You use это when you're talking about an unidentified object.<br>  <br>  Что это? = What is it? (you might have the object in your hand, or it's on a table, or it's on TV, etc.)|`|IdkyYkaZaa	Этот - is generally used for masculine words... Этот (boy)<br>  <br>  Это - is generally used in other terms

JCGtfNeTaa	You start with a false premise:<br>  <br>  >When asked where god came<br>  >from, they say they dont know.<br>  <br>  We do not say that "we don't know". We tell you that God is eternal, that He has always existed. There never was a time when He did not exist.<br>  <br>  Neither do we claim that everything has a cause, or that everything was created. God was not caused, nor was He created. He is the first, uncaused cause. He did not (as you say) come from nothing; He just was, is, and always will be.<br>  <br>  We know that the universe, on the other hand, is not eternal. Science has demonstrated that the universe had a beginning; it has not always existed.<br>  <br>  God, however, does not have a beginning and always existed.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	You wrote:<br>  <br>  Atheists say the universe came from nothing.<br>  <br>  If the universe came from nothing, then why could God have not always existed?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I should answer you because you don't care for Truth and are just arguing to argue, but you are so uninformed that I must <br>  <br>  1) First claim is false and is not the view of either believers or non-believers. Both agree that something MUST be its own cause. Absolutely must. Either the universe or God. It has nothing to do with where it came from !!!<br>  <br>  2) Most other gods are stupid fantasies and if you are trying to show yourself reasonable, you are looking the ***. People have voted with their rationality. Zeus is behind about 10000%. Why ? same reasons that Socrates and Plato gave, purely rational. Aristotle too.<br>  <br>  See this chart and see if you want to be stupid enough to defend the left hand side <br>  <a href="http://www.wku.edu/~jan.garrett/pgodscht.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wku.edu/~jan.garrett/pgodscht...</a><br>  <br>  And your diction is atrocious !! Just atrocious. How can you attribute 'amazing' to god and think you are being rigorous in your thinking. Care to embarrass yourself by further specifying that.<br>  <br>  PS one last thing...'Logic' refers only to the form of an argument, whether it is valid or invalid, not whether it is true or false, you can deduce a true conclusion from false premises.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Defeat it?  I embrace it, just not the way you do.  I have used this argument many times for the people that insist that God could not simply exist and yet dust could and more than this it goes boom and makes all we know.  As for your arrogance remark.  It would be true if we were wrong.  Other wise it is called truth.  Only time will tell and I am confident that I am right.  So much so I am betting my life on it.  Though it is not quite the wager others are making.  If I am wrong I am just dead, but if others are wrong they condemn themselves to a horrible existence.|`|mlGm0UDTaa	I guess i will give this a shot (On the third Page   and  most likely  wont be read). What you are asking is  "Out of  nothing  something comes?" <br>  And "Boom  it is  just there"<br>  Can't I say "Boom God  was just there"<br>  Is there a probability  problem or  do you  misunderstand that? if  one can  be  correct  hey other can be  correct<br>  God  Bless my  friend|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	isnt this pretty much admitting agnosticism? <br>  <br>  No not at all. Agnosticism means you don't know IF God exists, you are asking a different question, which is "Where did God come from?"<br>  <br>  Those are two different and distinct questions. I can know something exists without knowing its exact origin.<br>  <br>  For example, take the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nobody knew WHERE the Japanese planes were coming from...but that didn't make the Japanese airplanes any less real. <br>  <br>  Also, we do NOT say "God came from nothing". We say "God always was".  There is a big difference. <br>  Time, as Einstein taught is a dimension of our Universe, just like height and length. God exists OUTSIDE our Universe... much the way Jupiter exists OUTSIDE of the Greater London Metro Area.  I emphasis outside because thinking of something as existing outside of time is something our brains really aren't built for. We tend to see eternity as lots and lots of time...but it isn't. It is no time at all. <br>  <br>  You look at a map of London and you see the River Thames. Every spot on the map is either north of the river or south of the river. If you are on Google Maps then you can zoom out, and you can find spots on the Earth that are either north of the Thames or South of the Thames. Every spot on Earth will have to be one or the other. Then you look at Jupiter.  Jupiter isn't North of the Thames, but it isn't South of the Thames either. It is in a whole different frame of reference. It can't be fit into your map of London...but it still exists. <br>  <br>  That's kind of like how God relates to time.  He doesn't have an origin or a begining...because where He is "begining" is a concept without meaning....just as "five blocks west of Canary Wharf" has no  meaning when you are at the orbit of Io.<br>  <br>  The Universe on the other hand HAS a definite origin. Science tells us this. The Big Bang. The idea that the Universe "always was" was disproven a couple of decades ago.<br>  <br>  Lastly you ask "isnt it the height of arrogance to deem all other gods stupid fantasies, when your god supposedly amazing and perfect and real?"  Well not if it's true.  Captian Kirk and Mr. Spock and Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are no doubt much "cooler" and exciting than Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, a 45-year-old aerospace engineer who will become the first from his country to serve aboard the international space station... but Koichi Wakata is REALLY going into space later this week, and since the others are only fictional, they won't be.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Can you show me oxygen -- ??|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	That is like saying they were born by accident, their father and mother never had sex, so they came from nothing. God is outside of our universe, dimension and time. God is the cause of everything, and is uncaused. Meaning he existed before time and the universe. Besides having English in the world, we have hundreds of languages to communicate with one another. DNA is also a language, it can be read, and it can communicate intent. DNA just like other languages had to have someone start the process. Language did not come by accident, it has intelligent design.|`|3EudCWEuaa	Here is the solution to your problem:<br>  <br>  The universe had a beginning. It had a point where the singularity & laws of physics broke down, and at some point time began.<br>  <br>  So asking what or who created the universe is a logical question....Simply because it was indeed created. If something has a beginning, it is certainly logical to assume it had a first cause, or creator.<br>  <br>  God, however, has no beginning--since he is outside of the physical universe (as the bible points out, he exists before the universe does). Can you ask what created something that never had a beginning? NO. It is not logical. That is like asking how much the color blue weighs. <br>  <br>  God, being outside of time, does not have a beginning. So why no one knows what God is, or how God is, we can say that God wasn't created.<br>  <br>  The universe, on the other hand, has that dilemma since in fact it was created, had a beginning, and almost all scientific data supports this theory.<br>  <br>  <br>  Question 2: The good old, "Why is your god real." This one is so old on YA!.<br>  <br>  Do you honestly think that theologians, scholars, researchers, etc. have not considered all creation stories, and other gods? I assure you they have. Most gods probably weren't "Fantasies" but simply exaggerations of the one true God.<br>  <br>  If you talk to a bunch of friends, and they all talk about a movie they recently seen, but yet each one of them have a different interpretation & view of the movie, do you think the movie doesn't exist? Or do you assume there is 1 movie, and people just merely have created differing opinions and views about it? <br>  <br>  <br>  Your logic=FAIL.|`|c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	God is the one and Only Living God-<br>  False gods are worshipped from people that are refusing to believe in the Living God.<br>  <br>  Athiests that say something came from nothing are agreeing that a Baseball came from nothing- Every"thing" has a creator- A man make a Baseball and God created man and the universe he lives in.<br>  <br>  God was always there-and he is Spirit-He was Jesus Christ in man form so we could see Him.<br>  <br>  The universe didn't "come" from God- He created it- Just look around at the beauty of the earth and the heavens- Man is the one who creates wars and poluttion etc,,|`|AA10556726	I don't know any atheists that say the universe came from nothing.

I simply believe in a Gardener.  Is that arrogance, or logic.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	God coming from nothing and the Universe coming from nothing are two completely different thoughts.<br>  The universe is not God; it is not a being. It is inanimate - but it contains overwhelming evidence of special intelligent attention.<br>  God's eternal existence is part of the definition of God.  It's the type of being that he is.  He had no beginning. The physical reality that you perceive, including time, is all part of his creation.<br>  Before God created the universe, and you, there was not time.  There were no millions of years passing, and there were no seconds passing.  God just was.  He is God.  That's what God is and does.<br>  Scientifically speaking, this world view is much more plausible as an explanation for the origin of the universe, the earth and life, because it provides reasonable answers for what we find. <br>  Godless theories ALSO HAVE TO EXTEND BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF EMPIRICAL SCIENCE TO EXPLAIN THE MECHANISMS OF REALITY'S ORIGIN.   In other words, both systems involve miracles and require faith. One world view admits this, and the other denies it.

One of the most important maxims of science is matter cannot be created or destroying, just changed from pre-existing material. Because that is a major scientific fact, and atheists base their knowledge of the world in science, they must also believe said fact. If they believe said fact, than the world could not possibly have come from nothing, because matter cannot be created or destroyed.  Therefore, atheists are wrong in thinking the world came from nothing.|`|SDcFOv9Vaa	How do atheists know there was nothing have they solved a question which has plagued the top scientists for decades.

We have no answer until we can ask him ourselves, and that's where faith comes in. You have to have faith for something you're unsure of, and just keep believing. I used to wonder if God was real, and he has to be real. There is good and there is evil.<br>  <br>  It is much different to say the universe came from nothing opposed to God coming from nothing because God created the universe. Again this is where you just have to have faith.<br>  <br>  I know this is long, but it is a very long question, haha.<br>  <br>  People say that the sun is a god, and so on. But God created the sun, how can the sun be a god?<br>  <br>  Just have faith and keep praying to stay strong. Don't question yourself because you will become very confused, I know exactly how you feel!|`|IRUv7ifjaa	Other religions do this too,, its not just Christian belief. Religion was created by man to explain the unknown. Ever since we first gazed upon the stars or had the intelligence to realize our own mortality we wanted a reason for being here, for death and a hope that it is not the end.<br>  You also need to think of Religion as a source of government, for much of the dark ages, if it weren't for the Catholic church a lot of knowledge would have been lost. They also kept track of births deaths, ran hospitals and gave travelers a place to stay. In fact the Knights Templar, a christian order of knights created the first banks ( a person would cache there money in at a building owned by the Knights Templar. THey would then receive paper stating the value that is exchangeable at their next stop for the same value). <br>  The point of Religion is simple to make the world a better place, to further our understanding of ourselves and where and what we are. <br>  <br>  I am not claiming my God to be correct, my point is that if we all believe in a God (except for the select few) there is more likely to be a God in the first place. Also, it is hypothisiezed that the big bang (generaly accepted) created the laws of phyics, therefore before the big bang a mystical being such as God could have been.|`|AA10091424	Good questions.<br>  <br>  God didn't "come from" nothing.

The original land was taken by right of conquest. In 1760 the king agreed to turn over the profits from his lands, called the "crown estates". In exchange parliament agreed to give him a "civil list" to pay for his palaces and his own expenses. Today the crown estates are worth approximately ￡7,000,000,000 and they earn about ￡220,000,000 which goes to the country. Parliament pays about ￡40,000,000 last year to run the monarchy and take care of the palaces. The financiers often say ￡40,000,000 divided by 60,000,000 citizens of the UK works out to 66 pence per person. <br>  ----<br>  The Prince of Wales gets money from his dukedom in Cornwall. Prince Andrew also has a good paying job as a Trade & Investment representative. It is a good paying job, but you must be a member of the royal family to get the position. He also leases a mansion that belongs to the "crown estate".<br>  ----<br>  Queen Elizabeth has a personal fortune of about ￡320,000,000 which includes her personal castles of Sandringham and Balmoral.

There are sacrifices that have to be made some times. From a woman's point of view; as advice to the men: Women need to know and feel that you care and love them . Most importantly they need to feel safe. A woman that feels safe will open up her heart and her dutties and responsiblities will be a blessing to her. <br>  I think the ultimate desire by Allah for marriage is one that reflects The relation ship between the first man and woman. <br>  Adam was alone , lonely. There is only Adam and in one day he wakes up to see Hawwa (Eve ) next to him. Oh, how happy he must have been! What kind of feelings he must have felt. Thankfulness to Allah as well as a strong desire to love . protect , and cherish his wife. Eve was not .. then one day she was. How grateful to Allah she must have been ! What kind of feelings she must have had! What admiration and love she must have had towards him. I am sure her desires we to love, obey,  serve, and complete Adam because if it were not for Adam , she would not exist.<br>  As far as death or divorce goes, we all cope in our own ways. Surely either one is tragic. There is a grieving process that we must go though but the time will pass and that time will depend on many things including how much faith we have. Whatever occurs in our lives, has been allowed. We must chose to put our faith and trust in Allah . <br>  In death or divorce we should surround ourselves with sisters or brothers that will help us to be encouraged and strong.|`|AA11598520	When you are capable of writing a serious question, I will take it seriously.

Begin was Sephardic & was voted in by non-Sephardic.  The lines are crossed & votes are based on policy, nothing more, especially these days many years later where "intermarriages" are happening so there isn't even distinctions to continue.<br>  <br>  "ungrateful punished & grateful rewarded..."<br>  That's not what Judaism is about at all.  Is that want your religion is about?  Maybe learn about Judaism, because you aren't very familar with it.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	1. the president in israel is a very minor, ceremonial position. it is the Prime Minister who has the power. it's not like the president of the US. you'll find this to be true in many countries. the president is not an important position.<br>  2. i have no idea what you mean by divine succor. we don't believe in the christian idea of sin, or hell, we don't need to be saved, it's a totally different religion, if you can understand that.<br>  3. what does one criminal have to do with everyone else. when nixon or bush broke the law, did you blame all americans? stop generalizing.<br>  4. no, we don't believe the end time is around the corner and we need divine help to get through it. those are CHRISTIAN ideas, not jewish ones. we believe differently.|`|0CeyprLDaa	response: I call LIE on this one.

You say "IF this is the case..." as if you have some doubt whether the people who answered you were telling the truth.<br>  The facts are the following:<br>  - Only about 25-35% of the Israeli population is Orthodox<br>  - Only about 40% of Jews worldwide live in Israel<br>  - The makeup of the State of Israel is primary one of a secular, Western style democracy<br>  - The office of the "president" is ceremonial and is appointed, not voted for<br>  - Unfortunately, being Orthodox is not a guarantee of being G-d fearing<br>  <br>  That being the case, I am quite unclear on what your question actually is since it also seems to be based on assumptions when you say "how do you guys expect..." when you don't even know WHAT we (and who is this "we" anyways?) expect.

EYqTV2EYaa	It's simple. Tolerance is a disposition to allow freedom of choice and behavior. Therefore, if one can tolerate religion and race, it shouldn't matter what religious beliefs that person follows or what race that person is. For instance, would you still be person's friend if they followed a different religion and were a part of a different race? If so, you can tolerate it.
IwXuWX05aa	Everyone is scared as hell of me.|`|AA10007956	This is an interesting question!<br>  <br>  I don't think that Satan can be 'scared as hell of you' per se and most of the time I do not believe the ideology that Satan is some 'boogeyman' who roams the street looking for people to screw up.<br>  <br>  However, I do believe that to a certain degree we all allow Satan to tempt us into doing sinful things to ourselves and others around us, and by constant prayer, active self-awareness of what you are practising is positive and good, and a strong faith in the works and protection of God, we should fear no demon, no Satan, no temptation and fill ourselves with humility (too much pride can be misplaced!) that God has protected us.<br>  <br>  Jesus was all but filled with wonderful humility, as with many other prophets sent down to us, and we should gain inspiration from that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova.|`|5CoJZut4aa	interesting! well look at Jesus the most godly, good person we aspire to and look how he was tempted at every turn!

KKkOPwZMaa	We all do, but that's another flaw of the human mind. Even if we try to avoid it, we end up doing it.

I knew a Asian guy, who had a white mother and he admitted, as an adult, that when he was young he had problems with that.<br>  I am sure that both parents loved him so much, but it would be hard for the child to relate to others.

Mark Furhman (While he was beating up blacks as a cop and framing OJ for the murder of Nicole and Ron, Mark had a black wife at home who didn't care about what he did on the job as long as he "brought it" when he came home to her.)<br>  <br>  2. Chaz Hammelsmith Ebert (A judge who married Roger Ebert, a man with gray hair...an old man...while she is obviously middle aged.  But hey, the guy's white and 80 is the new 50, right?)<br>  <br>  3. OJ Simpson (Abandoned black wife and family for a white woman who was killed.  Even when a black lawyer got him off, he continued to chase white women--who stayed with him for his money obviously since he "confessed to killing Nicole" to them or told them "they looked like Nicole."  Whites bombarded him until he fell due to their intense desire to protect a white woman in spite of him being cleared by a jury and his intense stupidity for destroying the posibility of an entrance into the hall of fame and a satisfactory marriage to a black woman who truly loved him.)<br>  <br>  4. Shar Jackson (Married Kevin Federline and had a few kids with him.  Was abandoned by him for the white Britney Spears. Instead of being angry at him--as she would a black guy--she praised him and praised the home wrecking Britney as a "good stepmother.")<br>  <br>  5. Halle Berry (Allowed a white man to bend her over backwards and forcibly kiss her without any charges.  Dated whites all her life and made movies as their footstool, mistress and chasing them.  Married one black man then when he failed she turned her back on blacks and did a 100 yard dash into the arms of Gabriel Aubry.)<br>  <br>  6. Micheal Strahan (His wife Jean is currently removing half of his fortune from his bank account.)<br>  <br>  Black women are the best.  Don't come on Yahoo A! and shame us.  As a black man, I'm ashamed, astounded and bewildered that you "prefer" white women.  You were born black and that should've been the first thing that you considered beautiful.  Also, why does preferring non-black women always translate into "white?"  Is that because our society sells this image in the media and by the chess game plays of the rich elite?   I'm a black guy by the way, and I'VE got a problem with this.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Of course people have a problem with it. It was illegal in 16 states in 1967.  That wasn't too long ago.

me1srmEnaa	I personally don't believe that Islam tolerates other religions.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	"Tolerate" is an easy word to throw around. Muslims have indeed "tolerated" others such as Christians and Jews. They have just extorted money out of them in the form of a protection tax just like the mob does. The question is not "toleration." The queston is accepting other people as human beings with the same human rights, and political and social equality as Muslims. This Muslims do not do historically. So yea, it is easy for them to say "we tolerate" Christians or Jews. Ask them if they believe that Christians or Jews are equal to them politically, socially, culturally or morally and see what they say. You see, Islam does not teach that human rights are absolute regardless of views on religion! This is why you will hear a lot of Muslims say they "tolerate" others as long as they respect Islam as if a person's basic human rights protections has anything to do with his/her views on religion. You cannot deprive someone of their human rights because they do not like your religion or think it is stupid.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  And NO, most Christians do not have dietary laws. So pigs are NOT prohibited in Christianity. Where did you get that idea?|`|AA11336384	I tolerate all religions, unless they force them upon me. <br>  <br>  It is idiotic to not look past people just because of religion, as with race or sexuality.

Unfortunately there are too many who like to argue about other religions.  Same goes for some non-Muslims.

W4FtzyDnaa	Chinese would undoubtedly be the hardest for English speakers. Not only is it based on a completely different foundation (Unlike Latin, Spanish, French which all share similarities with English), but it is a tonal language, where various words are differentiated by pitch.  Chinese is probably useful if you plan on going into corporate business fields.<br>  <br>  Spanish is undoubtedly the most useful if you live anywhere in the South Western United States. A lot of people speak Spanish there - so much so that many businesses are crippled if they do not have a Spanish speaker on board. Thus, it will increase chances for employment in these regions if you can speak fluent Spanish.<br>  <br>  Spanish is also the easiest for English speakers, IMO.<br>  <br>  I've never learned French, so can't say much about it. French is probably a bit harder than Spanish since I believe it is a tonal language as well.<br>  <br>  As for Latin, it is about as useful as learning Old English or Old Norse. Good to learn if you want to get involved in deep linguistic or academic study, but not very much practical use otherwise.|`|98XPkvSqaa	If you speak only English, then Chinese will be the hardest to learn, but it also is the one I would recommend you learn.<br>  <br>  Spanish is probably the easiest to learn out of the group of choices you've shown.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	Chinese is better for big business corporations<br>  Spanish is better for small/local businesses and day to day in the U.S<br>  French is good for univeral organizations and worldwide interactions<br>  Latin is a dead language--I wouldn't recommend it<br>  <br>  It depends on what field you are interested in.<br>  <br>  Chinese is the hardest for an English speaker followed by Spanish and French (French is a tad bit harder than Spanish but not that much harder).|`|WRvwnBmIaa	It really depends on whether or not you want to use it outside of the classroom. Why would you want to learn another language if you don't plan on using it? (Unless it's for a job or a university application.)<br>  <br>  Spanish and Chinese has the best usage outside of the classroom since a majority of Asian immigrants are Chinese and if it isn't obvious enough the Latino community makes up a lot of the US population as well.<br>  <br>  My suggestion though:<br>  Chinese or Latin. <br>  <br>  French and Spanish is very cliche. It's a language almost every high school with a foreign language class has.<br>  <br>  The hardest would be Chinese unless you grew up speaking a little bit of it. Chinese writing is with symbols a lot more complicated compared to Japanese which uses a few Chinese characters. Each character has a certain stroke order and pronunciations is a lot different than English.<br>  <br>  The easiest would be Spanish. Spanish is a fairly easy language in my opinion.

So many people in the world are blind to the truth, “how is it possible that all the proof is there, but people just don't see it?”, is a common question heard from both sides of the spectrum. One of the things that most of the people I have ever talked to about this topic claim to believe in is; the existence of ghosts. All over the internet there is “proof” of ghosts existing, which causes scientists to bang their head up against the wall and again ask the question, “Why do people believe it?” Indeed, why do people believe strange, off the wall things?<br>  <br>  According to the Skeptics Dictionary, “a ghost is an alleged disembodied spirit of a dead person. Ghosts are often depicted as inhabiting haunted houses, especially houses where murders have occurred.” One explanation as to why people like to believe in ghosts is; they like to think that there is an afterlife, so when they die it isn't the end, and they aren't just a body rotting in the ground. Also, they like to believe that it is possible to see or maybe even interact with loved ones they have lost. Those are both very powerful reasons to believe in ghosts, and therefore it is quite difficult for skeptics to refute those professed beliefs and the arguments that go along with them. When someone “knows” that death isn't the end, they are going to defend that belief with everything they have, even if their argument doesn't make much sense.<br>  <br>  It is quite difficult for skeptics to refute the existence of ghosts simply because of ghosts' nature. For instance, ghosts like to do their work during the night, because it is difficult, if not impossible for people to see them during the day because of their physical makeup. Also, ghosts don't like to work in conditions where people might see them, because they want to retain the mysteriousness that makes them so scary. Now, reading this someone might say, “what?” That makes no sense, if they didn't want to be seen why would they only work in the nighttime, when they were most likely to be seen? Indeed, that is the skeptic's question, and another reason why the argument on the side of the believer makes little sense.<br>  <br>  Scientists have basically disproved the existence of ghosts by doing scientific studies and other research. In one particular study which was detailed by BBC News, researchers took a group of people in to a place that they had studied before hand, and had found environmental reasons for “ghosts”. These reasons were draftiness in certain areas of the room; strange noises caused by the way the air moved and other such things. Nearly all the people reported the existence of ghosts in the certain areas that the scientists had previously researched. This leads them to believe that one of the major causes for people reportedly feeling or seeing ghosts is environmental.<br>  <br>  Because of that theory, researchers also believe that mediums, or people who claim to interact with the dead, are simply people who are more sensitive than others to environmental factors. So those people were more likely to have feelings of being haunted then others, because they could feel draftiness and hear strange noises better than other people who were placed in the same situation.<br>  <br>  When talking about ghosts, one particular incident comes to mind for me. I was driving home with my boyfriend up in the mountains, because I live in Squaw Valley. Anyone who has driven in the mountains knows that the roads are rather curvy, and there is very little traffic. So, we were driving and we hadn't encountered another vehicle for quite some time, when suddenly we went around a curve and another car was sitting there getting ready to turn on to the road we were on, so it was at a “T” to us. At the point where our headlights met it looked like there was someone standing there wearing blue pants, but nothing else. We both saw this “phenomena”, and at closer inspection it was clear that there was no one there.<br>  <br>  Now, my first reaction was, “Isn't it crazy how the light can play tricks on our eyes like that?” My boyfriend's response was “That was no trick of the light, it was obviously a ghost”. I didn't respond at that point, but I was thinking how coincidental it was that a ghost just happened to be standing right at the point where our headlights and another car's headlights met. Also, I thought it was pretty odd that a ghost would be wearing just a pair of blue pants and nothing else. And, when I thought about it more, all I saw was the “blue pants”, so it kind of looked like they were floating in the air. I wonder who killed those pants, and why they wanted to come back and haunt people.<br>  <br>  Anther incident that is clear in my mind related to ghosts is something that happened with my cousin. We were all sitting around telling ghost stories, like kids do and he told this story about h|`|3ox4lYu6aa	I believe in them because I have actually seen them and I have proof in pictures and I have had creepy experiences.
FOzN3xwzaa	Please understand that salvation is NOT by "committing yourself to God". <br>  <br>  Salvation is by BELIEVING in Jesus alone for salvation  :)  Jesus loves you so very much!  :D<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)<br>  <br>  As for reading the Bible, start with Romans.<br>  <br>  Here's a website that teaches the meaning of every verse of every Book in the Bible:  <a href="http://www.soniclight.com/constable/notes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.soniclight.com/constable/note...</a><br>  <br>  It can help explain the verses that you don't understand  :|`|5CoJZut4aa	Good on you! but Genesis ouch that's a very hard book to start with.

I would recommend reading some of the Old Testament and New testament. For example; In the Old , read on a Monday, some of the Chapters of the Torah [law].  Tues; I would read some chapters of the Prophets (Joshua etc.) from the Old Testament. Next; on Wed. Some on the Writings (Psalms).  Thurs. Some chapters on the Prophets, again (Job). Friday; New Testament - some Chapters of the Gospels (Matthew - John); Saturday; New Testament starting with the Epistles (Book of Romans) some chapters.   This blend or mix of the Testaments and books, thereof, throughout the week, will present a variety of interest with a well-balanced approach.  Sundays you can read whatever you decide.  Keep it flexible and enjoy !

Reading the Bible can be a very overwhelming undertaking, but it is well worth it.  <br>  <br>  I personally recommend finding a way to get involved with other people who you can talk to about the Bible and debate different ideas because there is a plethora of ways you can interpret the Bible and no one can tell you which is right.  That is why there are so many branches of Christianity, such as Open Bible, Episcopalian, Pentecostal, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, I highly recommend finding a way to study the background of Roman culture and history as this puts what it said in the Bible into a perspective that most Americans/Westerners do not have the foreknowledge to understand the context of the situations and the principles and themes they were meant to illuminate.  <br>  <br>  There are many community colleges and churches out there that offer inexpensive ways to study the Bible.  There are many different orders that may be chosen, but I think the most important part is finding a way that you are comfortable with and that motivates you to keep reading because the hardest thing to do is actually finish it and understand what it means to you.

For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  27  Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  <br>  <br>  28  And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to  His purpose.  29  For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.  30  Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.  <br>  <br>  31  What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?  32  He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?  33  Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.  34  Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.  35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  <br>  <br>  36  As it is written: "FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE KILLED ALL DAY LONG; WE ARE ACCOUNTED AS SHEEP FOR THE SLAUGHTER."  <br>  <br>  37  Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.  38  For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,  39  nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	I recommend a good study guide - many are free online<br>  <br>  try searchtv.org and intouch.org|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	You cannot be "re-saved".

In this day and age, when there are so many lies and untruths floating around, being grounded on the word of God is more important than ever.

Genesis isn't important at all!<br>  <br>  Start with the Gospels...THAT is the important part. It's all about the Cross and Resurrection. Who begat whom and all that stuff really isn't important at all. Abraham is the first person in the Bible that really counts in my personal opinion... everything before that is just symbolisim.   What matters is John 3:16, not which King of the Nasty-ites messed with what part of Israel when.<br>  <br>  So read the Gospels. Start with Mark (I like Mark, it's short) then go through Matthew, Luke, and John. Then read the Acts, then start the Letters. Most folks I know tell me Romans is the most important letter, but it is also the toughest...so you may want to start with Corinthians. I like 1st  Corinthians..it has that wonderful bit in Chapter 13 about "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."<br>  <br>  Avoid Revelations...it's all 1st century symbolism. <br>  <br>  Then, and only then, move into the Old Testament. If you want to start with Genesis that's fine...but the O.T. makes more sense after you read the N.T.  All the prophecies about Jesus don't make sense till you see how they were fulfilled..then once you meet Jesus they all fall into place.<br>  <br>  Proverbs and Psalms are great. You might want to stagger your reading so most nights you read whatever book you are on, but once or twice a week you spice it up with Proverbs or Psalms. <br>  <br>  You can skip all the ancient Jewish Laws.  Jesus did away with those anyway, so there is no point in learning about what sort of Tassels you need to have on your cloak.<br>  <br>  Stick with it, hang in there, and God bless!|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	It's never a good idea to start with Genesis and try to read all the way through.  You'll either get bored or horrified at all the murdering and pillaging in God's name.<br>  <br>  Read the gospel first.  <br>  <br>  I'd start with the last 4 chapters of John.  It is Jesus's passion speech -- the last words He left with the apostles before they crucified Him.  <br>  <br>  Then read through the gospel of John.  Then go to the gospel of Mark, just to compare stories.<br>  <br>  Next, I suggest the epistles of John, which are in the back of the New Testament.  The Book of James is short and interesting too.<br>  <br>  Once you have a good idea of what the Bible is and isn't (i.e., it isn't a history or science book), skip around and find some books that interest you.<br>  <br>  But slogging through Numbers and Leviticus ... there is some pretty dry stuff in there.  You can get to that later.<br>  <br>  God bless you in your search!|`|macZI2dzaa	Genesis is deep.  I recommend starting with one of the Gospels and read it slowly, seriously and deeply, asking God for guidance to understand it.  Read the Gospel of John, it is powerful and deep, yet much of it is presented on a very basic level. <br>  I would not recommend reading the Bible beginning at the beginning and reading through each book in order.  If you are going to read Genesis I highly recommend Alan Ross' commentary on Genesis, "Creation and Blessing".<br>  <br>  Isaiah 8.20 "To the Law and to the testimony of God's Word, if mankind does not speak in line with these it is because mankind does not have the beginning of light."|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Please do yourself a favor,  don't just wing it and interpret things for yourself, the bible is very deep and complex.  <br>  <br>  Join a church, with a Pastor who has some serious academic credentials and who pulls in information about history, culture and language when discussing the bible.  This will show he has a thorough understanding and a broad interpretation of scripture IN proper context and not just what he personally thinks. <br>  <br>  ALSO look for an interpretation which is CONSISTENT with history, how 1st century christians believed and worshipped, as they were closer to the actaul events surrounding Christ's death and resurrection  and in some cases knew the Apostles personally. <br>  <br>  Any time we break with consistency and interpret things in a Modern context,  we run the risk of injecting our OWN biases and weaknesses, another wards we "read into things" too much.<br>  <br>  <br>  That would be MY advice.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Don't forget to find other Christians to fellowship with; even if you don't want to go to church you can always just go out for coffee or something with people who have the same point of view that you have.<br>  <br>  Have you had the chance to read the gospel of John yet?

There is a topical guide in the back that will direct you to all the scriptures about any given subject, a section dealing with the definitions and history of different terms in the Bible, maps and pictures showing the locations, etc.  Reading straight through is a really great way to study, and I definitely reccommend it.  If you're looking for alternate ways to study that might not show the same progress initially but might show you the relationships between different verses, the ways different prophets have talked about the same subjects, etc, that would be a really great way to go.  Obviously with it being the edition put out by the LDS church there are other works of scripture included in the references, but if you only want the Bible references you can always just limit yourself to using those ones.  Regardless, it's a really great tool and I highly recommend it for understanding of content, especially with regards to relating Old and New testament scripture and relating the books and prophets within each book.<br>  As for encouraging verses, may I direct you to the parable of the lost sheep?  Also, the Prodigal Son.  Remember that no matter what you have done, and where you have been in your life, God loves you and is pleased that you are making your way back to him.  No matter what lows you have experienced in your life (and I'm not assuming anything about you personally, I just know we all have them), He is always there to welcome you back with open arms.  He loves you personally and rejoices that you want to bring yourself near to him.

If he hears you, you have gained your brother.  16  But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that 'BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY WORD MAY BE ESTABLISHED.'  17  And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church.

syIp6d2Naa	When I was in the Army it was way before "don't ask" and I had no problem with it and I'm sure some of the Non-com's (Non Commissioned Officers) and a couple of the brass knew. I know my drill sgt did in basic training but I have never had it be a problem because I know to keep my mouth shut and when it's ok to talk about things like that. I don't shove it in folks faces either and my looks while tailored are not "butchy". I believe before long our new President is going to do away with the D.A,D.T, and allow gays to enlist as long as they don't use it or abuse the fact it's okay. I can't see them allowing a guy go drag for an off post pass, or a female to turn into a diesel dyke to go off post.  Also most of the gay clubs are on the list of places you are not to go to. Maybe that will change too.<br>  Being in the Army was one of the best things I ever did for myself and while it got a little lonesome and I got a "dear Jane" letter I never had any regrets. The one thing that may be harder for you is aboard a ship for any length of time and with all that's going on it is a possibility. Good luck, and thanks ahead of time, and know when your in your uniform there are a lot of us supporting and praying for you.|`|3yNvJ30jaa	NEVER. but thats only because...well...i dont want to. :) im anti-military for various reasons.(i think war is really stupid imo) :P but if you want to do it go for it!!! :D|`|fm2ba4ubaa	My family has a long line of marines, so my life is pretty much already paved out for me.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	Yep, going to spend a short while with The Royal Navy to honour the family tradition|`|AA11212023	I'd join the military [probably Marines] if I were more willing to do all that physical stuff they do..my mom thinks I would just cuz I take like 23 hours of dance classes a week, but that doesn't exactly prepare you for the military. <br>  <br>  I think it's stupid how people get all offended over the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. They need to realize there are people out there w/ different views, and in order to protect each other in combat, no one in the military should know each other's sexuality.

EKjnMQVhaa	A lot of times people will 'tease' someone who they think can handle it... if you've ever shown this boss that you have a good sense of humour, he's probably remembered that.  bosses want to be liked, and to be liked they have to make jokes in boring meetings to keep everyone's attention and favor, and maybe he thinks that you're the best one to humour his teasing.  it could, though it's hard to see, be a sign of respect.  and if you handle it well, he'll kinda get this trust with you.  so hang in there... bosses don't ordinarily pick on you unless they see something in you.  it's kinda dumb, but it's like sometimes when you have a crush on someone, you kinda pretend you hate them.  same kind of thing.<br>    that's my opinion, anyway.  good luck.|`|y1GQFRDEaa	The truth is that I believe you.

The seven promises or vows, of a Hindu wedding which are made while they take the seven steps together are as follows The first step is taken to earn and provide a living for their household or family, and avoiding those things that might harm them.<br>  The second step is taken to build their physical, mental and spiritual powers and to lead a healthy lifestyle.<br>  The third step is taken to earn and increase their wealth by righteous and proper means.<br>  The fourth step is taken to acquire knowledge, happiness and harmony by mutual love, respect, understanding and faith.<br>  The fifth step is taken to have children for whom they will be responsible and blessed with healthy, righteous and brave children.<br>  The sixth step is taken for self-control and longevity.<br>  The seventh step is taken to be true to each other, loyal and remain life-long companions by this wedlock.

I mean, Dr. Seuss has a few great ideas too, but I don't believe there is a cat in a striped hat driving a ridiculous machine around.  Fundamentalists say that there is no picking and choosing when it comes to the Bible.  Who's to say they aren't right?  I mean, who decides which parts to accept and which parts are "outdated"?  I can write a pretty good book too.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Why do you think that atheists hate the bible?  There is no basis for that.  Not believing in a God is not the same as hating the people who do, or their religious texts.|`|midmBgJJaa	Em, I don't believe in deities. But I find tolerance of gays, divorcees, liberated people, and "trying" people to be good.|`|AA10556726	Read it many times, I fail to see why I should take morality lessons from a book that does not met my moral standards or why I should believe in an imaginary god.|`|2rJwgk40aa	I dont love it or hate it.I just dont believe in it.<br>  Also,the God I hear most people refere to is far from all loving.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	There is no reason to believe such a silly thing.|`|TOm0lawCaa	Give me one good reason I should believe in god.<br>  <br>  or divorced people...?|`|2ogimlBxaa	I have no reason to. I don't hate it with all my heart.|`|fA42bQHraa	Well, to answer your question, the God in the old testament of the bible is far from "loving". Pretty brutal and cruel when you think about it. So, if you believe that the entire bible is the literal word of God and you live that way, you're not going to be a very accepting and loving person.<br>  <br>  In terms of atheists, they don't believe in God, that's why they don't read and follow parts of the bible, because it would be no different to them than you reading and following parts of a Harry Potter book.|`|yu53u5TFaa	The reason it has to be all or nothing is because of the fact that in the entire history of humanity, naturalistic answers for our questions have ALWAYS replaced supernatural ones. Zeus throwing lightning bolts has been replaced by meteorology, Poseidon shaking the earth has been replaced with seismology, demons possessing people has been replaced with medicine, and a literal account of Genesis has been replaced by evolutionary biology. Simply by looking at the history of science and the history of what we have believed as a species, it is clear to see that there is very probably a completely rational, scientific, naturalistic, "godless" cause behind the entire universe.|`|iAtanlT8aa	Well the bible does not portray a loving god, read exodus at the ten commandments and a few pages after, God speaks of how slavery is right for example.  And read 1 Corinthians 14:34,35.  And I never understood how god could send us to hell for our decisions if he made us and our surroundings, we have no say!|`|6ugR4qNsaa	I agree.

To further clarify, a God can be construed as being an Awareness.... a life form, an Awareness  that can say I am and and you are, or conversely, as we do, I am and God is. Life in all things is the propagation of the Infinite Awareness that always was and always will be. I agree that mythology and religion are great stories, the greatest stories we will ever come close to understanding. I agree that all  is one and one is all..............peace.....|`|GH48p1Loaa	i don't, and i don't think in another hundred years it will be considered as such by the entire population.

Then We placed him as (a drop of) sperm in a place of rest, firmly fixed;<br>  <br>  14. Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood; then of that clot We made a (fetus) lump; then we made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then we developed out of it another creature.

The sin of fornication is forbidden by God the originator of marriage. There are instances where God exterminated 1000s of people because of the sin of fornication. Do you not know that sex is for re-procreation? So if you are not married to the guy and you got pregnant how will you fell or the shame of having an illegitimate child, remember your family will be involved. Why not wait till you marry?|`|KNYkexELaa	Getting married doesn't make you responsible and it isn't supposed to. The commitment required in marriage, financially and emotionally, demands a great deal of responsibility. If you can bear that responsibility you can handle sex. I think that's the case for your last paragraph.<br>  <br>  That said, I don't think it's a sin, but too many people ARE irresponsible with premarital sex.|`|xrl96EHTaa	Sin? I wouldn't use such a word. I think it's best to wait. Even contraceptive isn't 100% effective, neither is abortion, and having a child before you're financially stable and ready could be a disastrous mistake. There are also psychological issues to contend with as well, in dealing with premarital sex and.. how one feels he might stack up against previous partners. All in all, I think it's a very common recipe for disaster. But I don't think it should be a crime, I just think people should be a little smarter, and a little wiser.|`|AA11336384	In my  born religion (Islam), obviously, they regard virginity in the highest honor. (At least, the more respectable ones, ones who don't believe in polygamy, or beat their wives into submission.)<br>  <br>  Maybe someone wants to wait until marriage to be safe, and to be sure one is in love. <br>  <br>  Marriage, however, does not necessarily mean infinite, lasting love. So I don't believe it is a sin.|`|TMRGOAa8aa	I think God understands love more than any of us... I know exactly your situation, so who is to judge your actions but yourself and God? God knows you're in love and I seriously believe that giving your body to someone is the most amazing act of love you can ever give someone. So if you're truly in love, why do you have to wait for marriage? <br>  <br>  I'm catholic and I know it's "against" my religion to believe what I do, but God forgives and if you trust and and are in love with your partner, you should be A-okay. =)|`|5ifHSNSraa	Sex outside of marriage is like..salt. You have too much and it destroys you. However in marriage you just get the right amount and helps you and makes you healthier.<br>  <br>  And the Bible says i clearly many times it's a sin. Outright and not so outright.<br>  <br>  And on to being married, you should only be married when you have made yourself ready to be married, you have to be responsible before marriage. Too bad no one understands this and the divorce rate is like 50%|`|9eMJsBoZaa	Interesting take, I'm not really sure. I don't know if its only the Catholic church that started the premarital sex is a sin or if thats all Christianity.

God said that you should never have sex until you're married.|`|nVeGysnSaa	I believe if you really love the person then why is it a sin? It's not your sitting on a street corner....|`|Tj0A8f8Taa	No. Btw there is no such thing as sin.|`|B1fsP4ahaa	Love is love, and sex is a part of love.

And that god would be happy and understand.|`|Ac3Z0RLuaa	Nope,<br>  plain and simple.|`|cmZ5Opmuaa	Sex without marriage is called "fornication" and "fornication" in the bible is sin. Read Galatians 5 like that one guy said. It talks about it....it doesn't matter who you are, what you've done, what religion you are. its still a sin. keep that in mind...and you know what?! lol not you. but for all of the people who say that "love is love, sex is beautiful." WELL DUH! it is beautiful! if you are MARRIED! Its plain disgusting if you arent married. and besides you could get a whole bunch of diseases from having sex with guys who only like you for sex. guys are stupid you need to go to church and find a diff guy who loves you not for your body or stupid boobs but for the inside.|`|yaXmgTUhaa	If you are agnostic you really shouldn't mind. You see being agnostic as I once was (I'm atheist now) means you really have the same options as atheists do. You choose to live life by your own choices and let yourself suffer the consequences, not from a higher power or authority but from your own judgment. Do what you think is right. To me, it seems like religion is peer pressuring you really. You are choosing whether or not to make your own choices just because you are afraid of it being wrong according to something or somebody else (god) and not yourself. Just do what you believe is best for you and if you wish to seek comfort in religion so be it, but in my opinion religion is bad. It causes havoc and trouble for those who misuse it. And the senseless rules of religion to me is just practical misuse of one's life. If you must go on living life just to please one omnipotent being (god) then I highly doubt you're life will be as enjoyable in the end despite the comfort you have gained from religion.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. and honestly I'm not trying to bash other's views but if you are really willing to believe that you shouldn't have sex before marriage because GOD said so instead of by pure choice or your own judgment, then I think that just goes along with the saying "If he/she told you to jump off a bridge would you do it?"|`|CLB32006aa	nope, marriage was created by man and sex is a natural tool of reproduction. Sex was around before there were even words and is a normal part of most life, marriage was created relatively recently considering. Just use protection and be safe.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Keep thinking :)|`|MPX0f5jzaa	No, I think it's the most unhealthy recommendation anyone could make.<br>  <br>  You're absolutely right on all points.  I'd never wait until marriage because some people are just terrible in bed and I'm not down for a lifetime of that.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	No. But it is an intimate act and should not be entered into lightly (lol is that in some church's marriage vows?). Emotions are involved and people can be hurt, there can be the danger of std's and pregnancy so precautions should always be taken.  Jumping from bed to bed doesn't help one's self-esteem. (men and women).<br>  <br>  I see it as no sin per se, just an act to be thought out before doing.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	I am a simple person I only have one definition of sin:  To intentionally try to do harm to another person.  If your activities have caused not harm then they cannot be sinful.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Ummm....Ten Commandments.  Yeah.  If you believe in the fact that those are important laws or Gd's laws, then, sex before marriage is a sin...|`|lXu5cJd1aa	I don't. Why? THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SIN.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	The Ten Commandments do not mention sex at all, so I am not sure what Jane is on about.<br>  <br>  If you are responsible in terms of safety and you are both ready, then sex will happen. It is a fun and a wonderful sharing. Nothing about marriage makes it better, but it does make it more acceptable in some people's view.<br>  <br>  If you are over 18, you are an adult and can make your own decisions. I would wait until then.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Yes premarital sex is a sin.  God blesses the marriage bed only where 2 people commit to each other and become one in the Lord.  <br>  <br>  From what you've stated you are leaving God out of the equation and if you do not become the spiritual leader of the family then your married life will never be in order.  Already that has been proved because you are dating your second love.  God only puts one man and one woman together.  God does not give a man many different women.  <br>  <br>  You either choose God's way or man's way, but you can't have it both ways because God says you can't!  And the Creator brought you into this world and He can take you out.  And we will be judged by Jesus the Christ and held accountable for our sins.|`|8TLEjhqaaa	nope.<br>  i'm not religious.<br>  i don't believe in sin.<br>  <br>  if i was supposed to wait for marriage,<br>  then that would be never.<br>  i'm not planning on getting married.<br>  <br>  sex is way too much fun.<br>  <br>  edit: if you think it's a sin, it is.<br>  if i'm correct, agnostics believe in a god<br>  but not the organized religion concept right?<br>  as long as you're not hurting anything living<br>  then there is no problem my friend.<br>  :).<br>  keep hitting the sheets.|`|HSaVBaiaaa	If it was a sin, why did god tempt you with it in the first place? Just to torture you with the idea? Sounds pretty cruel to me. I don't get why he wouldn't just make people horny once they married.|`|hiCSVwchaa	I think it's a rule for a bygone age when marriage happened very early and contraception wasn't available.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	Yes, the bible calls it fornication.|`|faT4MyVkaa	Only when done right.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes.|`|T9kMy13Haa	I can think of only one reason to wait. After sex men release large amounts of  vasopressin, a chemical involved in long lasting love. If you have sex you fall in love faster and more easily with that person. You're more likely to have a lasting marriage if you wait because then you will know that sex wasn't involved in falling in love so you probably are more compatible than if you had fallen in love after sex and therefore were possibly less compatible. If you don't plan to marry somebody you should totally have sex with them!|`|uUYdkjCFaa	I believe that it is best to wait, but I also believe that what a person does is between them and God.  It is not my place to judge.  I had sex before marriage.  It is good to hold out for someone you love and no love and marriage are not a hand-in-hand thing.  It is a personal choice and like I said if anyone judges you for it it is there problem.  To me it is a bigger sin to judge others.<br>  A sin is a sin no manner if you believe or not, but like I said.  Its something that only you will have to deal with on a personal level.|`|cfd799ae3af764d62aaee45bc1bb1c06aa	Agreed. <br>  <br>  I don't believe that we should be limited by the beliefs and teachings of a blood-thirsty, primitive culture. That is, the culture of the old testament.<br>  <br>  Their morals are reprehensible and cannot be considered admirable.

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<br>  <br>  Many people try to justify it, but you cant change Gods word.

Sooner or later you will have to decide either your going to follow the word of God or your going to deny it.... only you can make that choice... and only you will be accountable to God for it.<br>  <br>  As for being agnostic friend, sin is sin whether you believe in it or not, dosnt change the reality of it.|`|FP5MsZ7iaa	No! We have to be realistic. Sex is an important factor in marriage. Would you take the risk to marry and live with someone without knowing if both can have a good understanding from this aspect? I wouldn't.<br>  My mother who is now more than 80 years old had same idea. When she was telling that to her friends, they were shocked. But finally, she was right. She had a happy life with my father till he passed away. I'm not sure that her friends could tell the same.<br>  <br>  PS In the 10 commandments, there is nothing about premarital sex. It is said in the original text: "Do not feel desire for someone else wife" (I can read the Bible in Hebrew)

But some bibles have a topic index, so if your wondering what god says about a certain topic, such as dating you can look it up.  I would recomend a NIV bible.  Or if you know of someone like a pastor, or a person you know has a relationship with God, it doesnt hurt to ask them questions.  And also something very important to do, is give your life to him.  When your serious about letting god into your life, make a prayer.

Spanish is written as it is spoken, so keep that in mind. If you know your pronunciation or memorized the words, then the spelling should be fine/close--make sure you use your accents and tildes(~)! They're very important!<br>  <br>  Rules for accents in case you don't know them:<br>  <br>  1. if the word ends in n, s, or a vowel, you stress the next to last syllable.<br>  <br>  Bajas. BAjas. Flojo. FLOjo. Trabajaron. TrabaJARon. If it breaks this rule, but the accent on the vowel in the syllable that does.<br>  <br>  2. If the word ends in any other consonant, you stress the last syllable. If it breaks this rule, but an accent on the vowel of the stressed syllable.<br>  <br>  3. Other words you need to memorize. They could follow the rules but have an accent just for distinguishment. Si (with an accent) means yes. Without it, it's 'if'.<br>  <br>  4. If you have two vowels in a syllable, the stronger vowel gets the accent. A, E, and O are strong ones. I, and U are weak. And sometimes Y. xD

dtrYjyYZaa	In Wicca in general we do not have the need to separate light/dark, good/evil.  As in nature theses things are in balance.  As a person we are capable of deciding to do no harm or to harm others with our actions.  Many of us believe in the 3 fold law that say what ever we do good/bad is returned 3 fold to us.  <br>  <br>  Christianity is built around the idea that their God is pure Good.  So they needed balance which is the Devil who is pure evil.  Interestingly enough the Devil also, at times, give Christians a scape goat when they do wrong.  "The Devil made me do it"  <br>  <br>  By the way, I suggest you read the bible.  Not as a rule book, or something to be devoted to but as a History book.  Mainly the Old Testament.  If you skip the Gerontology stuff it can give you insight to how people lived and thought way back then.  <br>  It would also behoove you to learn about the history of how the bible came into being and the role Constantine played in Christianity.<br>  All knowledge is good.  <br>  <br>  Bright Blessings|`|VncSMLMpaa	As the Bible is the inspired word of God which guides true Christians what you ask seems a little short-sighted.<br>  <br>  The Word of God offers salvation through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God. What could be better than that. If we are faithful and obedient to the end we are assured of eternal life in God's coming kingdom through His grace.<br>  <br>  That might not have an appeal for you as you seem to prefer the ways that God has condemned but there is always a possibility of a change, as long as it's not left too late. We never know what tomorrow will bring. But when Jesus returns he will resurrect the dead, some to everlasting life and some to everlasting death. We choose every day in the way we live our lives.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	i dont fear the dark at all. Its just the opposite of light. To me I dont understand what there is to " defeat " . There was darkness b4 light.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Darkness, demons, evil -- yeah, they go to together, even in Shakespeare. But I don't fear it. Jesus is the One to whom Satan will bend.<br>  <br>  You must know the quote of St Teresa of Avila, right !<br>  <br>  ""I am more afraid of those who are terrified of the devil than I am of the devil himself."|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I have no idea what you're talking about.  Jesus is the light and those who have Jesus do not fear the darkness.<br>  <br>  We do fear for people who are IN darkness however.  That is why we try and reach you with the gospel.|`|h1eBWehMaa	darkness is a symbolism of evil or satan|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	If you seek to understand something about Christianity, it is really difficult to explain much without the Bible. Christians are not called to live in a spirit of fear and we are not afraid of the dark. I am sure you have enough literary knowledge to understand that the term 'darkness,' is a symbolic representation of evil. God bless.|`|LRsd01Dtaa	Darkness is intangible and has no substance...it exists out of the sheer absence of something...light. Darkness is used symbolicall to represent evil because evil is the absence of good. Cold is to heat what sin is to forgiveness...there can be one without the other but not both at the same time. It's more to the fact that a sinful person fears the light. If you exist in darkness and someone flips on the light..what is the first thing one does...flinch blindingly away from it...then...what comes into focus first..that which is nearest to ones self. So with light comes allot of clarity and understanding, self analysis and guilt over ones present condition...with light, aka knowledge, wisdom and consul by the Holy Spirit through God's law...one sees themselves finally and it's usually not a pretty sight. Christians fear the dark because the dark is ignorance, delusion, blindness, dullness of Spirit, lack of conscience or guilt and can lead to destruction. Does that make sense? Choose life. Love in Christ, ~J~|`|U0JYa0Fxaa	Selah is a dumbass<br>  First off i'm not Christian i'm kinda my own beliefs...use to be Catholic ...but turned away from the bs.<br>  <br>  From what i understand,darkness is associated with death and evil. So darkness if represented that way would also in someway reflect satan and stuff like that. Seeing as satan isn't exactly well liked by Christians it would be safe to assume thats why darkness needs to be feared. Also your idea of the unknown is correct.|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	I think darkness is just a symbol any human (whether they're Christian or non-Christian) use as another way of saying "evil". There's nothing wrong with the quality of darkness, nighttime, etc. But generally the dark as viewed as being less safe, so it's a metaphor associated with the devil.|`|AA11613911	the light shines forth in the darkness, but the darkness cannot understand it... with all of its power, the darkness can never overpower a single light|`|vvgodUChaa	FEAR HAS TO DO WITH PUNISHMENT,SENCE CHRIST DIED FOR ALL SIN AT THE CROSS ,WHAT IS THERE TO FEAR?

A great many are, and it comes across in some form even in several pagan religions.<br>  <br>  To primeval man, darkness was a thing to be feared - and to some extent, it still is today.  More crime happens at night.  Our most-used sense, sight, is useless at night, which means we don't know what's out there, and if there's one thing humans have always feared, it's the unknown.  It makes sense that that fear made its way into religions.|`|AQIhcBiuaa	I think it was meant to be metaphorical, but some people have just taken it way to literally.  I believe that God created the literal dark and Light to compliment each other as a beautiful part of nature. I do think that you are right about the fear of the unknown. I am sure that as a Wiccan you have seen how people can act when they fear what they do not understand. They feel that they need to defeat it. I personally prefer to ask questions and learn to understand.|`|pfNnuD5saa	No, in the Bible the word darkness is used for evil.  It isn't fear of the unknown. If you are referring to the fact that some denominations denounce Wicca, that's a different story.  I have no issue with Wicca, I actually have some very close Wiccan and Pagan friends. I don't view Wicca as evil, it just wasn't for me.|`|4293cf50016bde6c1a79ccb90dbe6c96aa	Darkness is evil and goodness is light.  There is a huge spiritual battle going on in the heavenly realm based on good and evil.  Satan is constantly trying to capture the hearts of God's people only to turn them away and destroy them.  God has already won the battle, but Satan continues to roam this earth looking for someone to destroy.  I know you don't believe in the Bible, but understand that we do, so our answers will always be based by this truth.|`|xrl96EHTaa	It's not just Christianity that 'fears the dark.' All of humanity has that dark-light symbolism. Night is a time where thieves and robbers come out, where your sense of sight fails you, and where shadows seem menacing. Not to mention nocturnal predators. It created fear in a lot of early people. I think fear of night translated itself into religion, and not the other way around.|`|X1HrowLmaa	You may not be right if you demand that the Bible should not be used to answer you your question where is the authority you hold to answer. Well it may sound too odd to you that what you said is a mere allegation that cannot be substantiated.<br>  The is no dark side in true christianity, Jesus preached the good news and true christians are doing same today.|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	Darkness (satan) has already been defeated by Jesus, and most of doctrine is not about darkness, it's about truth and life, but I understand you would not know that.I do not have fear of the unknown, I am totally aware of whats going on, thanks, are you?|`|LhCTfw95aa	Have you seen what comes out at night? Things that wish to remain hidden, thing that wish to cause harm unobserved. Do you walk alone at night down unlit paths? Do you go into dark alleys? <br>  <br>  It's just common sense, christian or not.|`|HsbDGCY6aa	defeating the darkness would be the equivalent of trying to defeat and rid the world of things like rapists, murderers etc...I dont consider wicca darkness|`|5ifHSNSraa	...It's metaphor for for evil?<br>  <br>  I mean in most the time darkness is the metaphorical equivalent to evil and/or death.
EYqTV2EYaa	I agree with you. Although, it's not about the amount these celebrities have on their paychecks that increases the recession in this economy, it's the little amount of taxes these people have to pay, and what they do with their money. See, no matter how much these people make, our country USA would still be the richest, meaning the economy is only affecting the poor and some of the middle class. Therefore, if they paid more EXPENSIVE taxes to the poorer people instead of just taxes based on the crap they own, they can better neighborhoods, schools, homes, and actually give the poor a financial boost. As a result, they could save people from this recession. I've noticed you said you don't think the celebrities don't deserve so much money. However, in my opinion, I believe it's fine. See, celebrities get paid large amounts of money from the privately owned businesses they work for. Intertwining, I believe people have the freedom to make any deal they please. See, if I wanted to give a friend of mine $1,000 just for cutting my grass, so be it, you get me? Therefore, it shall be no different for a big business. I'm all for private property. I do however, I believe it should be maintained tax-wise by the government to keep the recession from happening. Like, when large amounts of money are made, they should pay a large amount of taxes aimed at those issues for a good cause. Therefore, the rich can still have their money, the poor would get a boost and the ability to help themselves, and their would be 'peace' with the middle-class finally.<br>  <br>  To Ed the freshman: Your answer is partially correct because you're right; the only reason that, for example, films studios make so much money is because people love their movies. However, you also have to consider because those industries make so much money, they can pay a lot to have actors act for them. Therefore, they make tons of money even before their movie becomes a hit. Also, another example can be the NBA. See, if the NBA in the past didn't have any fans, it wouldn't exist now because people wouldn't pay, and it would go bankrupt. Thus, you're right about that. However, because that didn't happen and they are now VERY rich, they can offer players like $10,000,000 even before they step on the court. Therefore, it's not always about paying money to support them, it's about private deals that offer a lot of money regardless of what we pay in the contemporary times.|`|4Vmlf902aa	No, because remember celebs are paid big cause their movies have a great performance while out. So you stop watching movies, Studios don't make as much $$, and celebs don't get paid as much. Athletes are paid plenty cause that is their job, and if their good ppl adore them. So who wouldn't want someone who they know will take them to the playoffs on their team? That's why athletes are paid big bucks, if they're good ppl want them, and are willing to pay big. But honestly you can't score touchdowns, or make slam dunks for long. Considering they age eventually, which means no more making 2,3, or 4 million a year.

You don't see Mafia members kill and rape females just for their pleasure. You usually see Mafia members drowning and killing grown men who have made a mistake. Also, all the mafia really wants is money, that is ALL they want. Also see the nice clothes they have on, like suits and what not.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ethnic gangs usually want recognition and a lot of them kill people based on what the other person is wearing or what race he is (Mexican gangs in LA killing Black males for example).

That's why they feel so strongly about being anti-Christian. I know that their beliefs are different, but they wouldn't bash us so hard if there weren't people out there right now making us look bad. Personally I claim to be Christian, but I am not really a part of a group or Church. So therefore I guess I am not really into religion. I have my beliefs, I hold to my beliefs, but I don't force my beliefs on others.

The reason the founders set it up that way was so that the rights of the minority could never be taken away by tyranny of the majority.  At least in theory...<br>  <br>  And one big part of our constitutional republic is that no one religion is to be supported, endorsed, or established as "standard" by the government.

The fact that my vote as an Atheist has just as much weight as your vote as a Christian is what makes it secular.|`|WbaN6osZaa	WOw, you are RIGHT!!!!|`|n6NJ1e2daa	Umm what? No. They are just tired of Christians forcing religion down their throats. Everybody has the right to believe what they want to, thanks to our wonderful Constitution and its 1st Amendment.

Don't tell her - just 'kidnap' her and take her to the airport. Don't worry about clothing - you can either surreptiously pack a bag, or buy what you need when you get there. Every resort has shops that offer bathing suits, tee shirts and shorts.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	A trip that she has always dream about.

msVBFJpwaa	Because the Constitution says that we all have the freedom to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.<br>  <br>  Gay marriage fits all three criteria:<br>  <br>  The Freedom to live our lives as we see fit.<br>  The Liberty to be the people we were meant to be.<br>  And pursuing Happiness with the person we want to spend the rest of our lives with.<br>  <br>  No where in that does it say we have to do all those things with the opposite sex.|`|BpE2eHS5aa	because its not supposed to matter to anybody who gets married. and why they get married to that person.<br>  ur sexuality is just like ur skin color, you cant determine it. it just happens.  if you just so happen to be gay/lesbian and you fall in love. (like all people) you want to get married.and then you find out its illegal.<br>  <br>  <br>  now THATS some f*cked up sh*t.<br>  <br>  EQUAL F*CKING RIGHTS. (excuse the language)|`|EMVT2xjEaa	We do not live in a theocracy, so religion should play no part in our politics.<br>  <br>  There is difference between a legal marriage and a religious marriage. <br>  <br>  A legal marriage is a legal contract between two people. To achieve this, you must go through the court system, which from my knowledge has nothing to do with a church/religion. Legal marriage plays no part in religion.<br>  <br>  The issue I guess is people think gay marriage will force churches to allow gay marriage. No it will not! A church can refuse to marry anyone because they can do what they want. But their wishes should not dictate US policy.<br>  <br>  Gay individuals just want equal rights under the law. They are not trying to change religious dogma.|`|OsY0lmTCaa	Because every gay person deserves the exact same right to be miserable that I have. That's right I'm anti-marriage and pro-gay rights. That means as long as it's legal for ME to marry it should be legal for them to marry.|`|lenqvpWKaa	This is what i think about marriage...<br>  <br>  <br>  I think anyone should deserve the right to be with the person they love. Who ever said that it had to be a guy and a girl? Whoever said its not "normal" to marry the same sex? Who ever did is a retarded dick head. I think people are people, gender shouldnt change that.|`|0T769lIuaa	equality. i dont remember voting if a male and female could marry, do you? i think its funny how the most conservative christans are against gay marriage...yet they have no problem getting a divorce. if gay marriage is breaking tradition then what is divorce doing??|`|nuCXcLUIaa	Equal rights that we are all entitled to as Americans.|`|EOaFZoNtaa	Because equal rights were intended for everyone. No matter your sexual orientation race or culture. you should have the right to marry who your in love with and not have to commit to a certain society that is excepting and unstable.<br>  The emotion that goes into a heterosexual relationship goes into a homosexual, or asexual relationship to.<br>  Who is anyone else to make life harder for people in love and people who want to be legally bound. <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Cheers|`|EDpvAf6Zaa	Because there are no good reasons for it to be wrong.<br>  Other people's reasons:<br>  "Being gay is sin." So the bible says being gay is a sin. Does that mean that someone of a different religion should have to not be gay so they don't sin? Our government isn't ruled by religion. That's the point. It's America.<br>  "It's wrong." Wrong in what sense exactly? Because it's up to you to decide who a random stranger marries? No one is forcing anyone to be gay, it's what they want, let them marry who they want.<br>  <br>  They government should have no decision on who anyone marries. If two people want to get married, are mature enough to make the decision to get married, then who cares? Why should anyone wish someone a lifelong of unhappiness for being gay and not being able to marry who they like?<br>  These days, it would be obscene to say that black people can't marry white people. Because neither one of them can control what race they are. Gay people can't control being gay either, but the government feels the need to not allow them to get married.<br>  It's not fair.|`|3NCaUqRaaa	mainly because it shouldn't be up to anyone but you to decide who you marry, and if it's the whole being gay thing that people have a problem with, stopping people from getting married isn't going to change that. and hey, if they're worried about the tax thing, two guys get married, two girls get married, same amount of married couples right?|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	Equal rights was the reason that this country was founded. That alone is a glowing reason to legalize same-sex marriage.<br>  <br>  Re (Tina Y): Why don't you actually answer the question? That is instead of cheaply coming in, thumbs downing a bunch of us, and snatching 2 points you didn't earn.|`|n5kfXGpLaa	America is based upon freedom. It isn't are business to stop people from loving each other. People are entitled to love who they want I guess...|`|fk2Be1claa	If we lived in theocracy, then Gay people would be slaughtered. lol...

NirBfNfMaa	It's hard to pinpoint exactly what a person's heritage is.<br>  <br>  People only know I am Italian when I tell them I am. I'm full Italian too. If they said French I wouldn't care either. A couple of my Sicilian relatives can pass for Middle Eastern! It's just really hard to tell, unless you live in an area that has a large immigrant community. And being darker than European and lighter than Middle Eastern can be a whole lot of different nationalities. In fact, many of my Armenian friends have that complexion. In fact, one of my Armenian friends didn't know that my other friend was Armenian until she said something!<br>  <br>  I don't live in an area with many Albanians (I'd love to meet some though :) I enjoy meeting people from other cultures), so I probably couldn't pick one out of a crowd.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	cause you posted it in the lesbian section|`|LzzTpVEUaa	Because you have dark skin, obviously.<br>  <br>  And lol wrong section!|`|FGfaO2Ecaa	I don't know.

3BHPJweWaa	*If* the "God"-of-belief *exists* -- "He" has no *choice* but to use "imperfect" humans as "His" messengers to humanity (if "He's" to *have* messengers) -- since there are nothing *but* "imperfect" humans that humans-in-general *understand* (however imperfectly! ;)  ).<br>  <br>  Of course Direct Communication with everyone -- from "God" is the optimal condition.  But few are *seeking* that with the all of their being; few are genuinely *receptive*.  <br>  <br>  People listen to other *people* -- not to "God"!  It is very *frowned* upon to be listening to God!  If you go making *that* claim, that God is talking to you, very often you'll be treated as being delusional, insane... may be locked up in a mental institution -- or even *executed* in some places!<br>  <br>  As to "imperfect messengers" -- this fully includes Jesus (& Mohammad) -- regardless of Christian (or Islamic) beliefs to the contrary.  A truly *perfect* being does not curse a tree -- killing it -- for not providing fruit OUT of season.  (If my Dad cut down all the trees in his orchard for not producing fruit "out of season" we'd say he was insane.)  A man who teaches, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" -- if he is *perfect* -- does not practice otherwise, himself.  (Hard to believe that Jesus, himself, would've *wanted* to be whipped -- as he whipped the moneychangers in the Temple.)  <br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 reveals what Jesus intended (at that time) to do when he returned.  If *that* is "perfection" then Adolph Hitler, Saddam Hussein & Josef Stalin were *all* "perfect men"!<br>  <br>  So! -- the *historical* Jesus was *not* "perfect" (he had a fallible ego just like the rest of us do -- else why would he have said, "Thy Will, not my will, be done"?) -- which is why it is actually *possible* for others to do "greater works" than *he* did! [John 14:12]  (However, i am *not* saying that the Living Spiritual Christ Essence -- *now* -- is in any way "imperfect"! -- only that human conceptualizations of the "perfection" of the *historical* Jesus are false.)<br>  <br>  The Bible *does* say that Job was a "perfect" man. ;) Job 1:1, KJV<br>  <br>  Obviously the stories concocted about "God" by "imperfect men" are going to be "imperfect", thus leading to all manner of false expectations & misunderstanding... & the Bible & the Qu'ran are among the most "imperfect" books in *existence* when it comes to trying to understand the Living Divine Mystery.  (The *Tao Te Ching* is *far* more "perfect* a "scripture" than the monotheistic scriptures.)<br>  <br>  Relative to truly, accurately understanding the All of That-Which-Is -- spiritually speaking -- as humans we're like the white blood cells in our own bodies trying to understand *us* -- in our own physical totality, in our emotions, our thoughts, our concepts, our aesthetics (art, music, dance, the flavors of foods).<br>  <br>  i'm a panentheist.  From my perspective, everything that *really* exists (all matter, all energy, all awareness, all intelligence, all nothingness... even including human imagination) is *all* aspects of the Divine All (whether we call this "God" or "Goddess" or "The Mystery" or whatever else).  Therefore, if there is imperfection, then "God" is imperfect, too -- wherever imperfection exists.  We need to WAKE UP & *deal* with this simple reality.  We are Living Agents of potential *change*!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cosmicwind.net/800/Cmwl/GnosticTransitions/HelpGodShaw.html" rel="nofollow">http://cosmicwind.net/800/Cmwl/GnosticTr...</a><br>  <br>  The "God" of theistic belief simply does not *exist* -- in the manner in which their scriptures portray "Him" -- except as a mental construct *of* their belief.  Every lie, every distortion of anybody, every fantasy *does* exist, similarly -- as a part of the mental envelope, as long as anyone believes it.<br>  <br>  But still -- there *is* That-Which-Is -- which underlies, exists in-thru all life, all awareness, all consciousness, the entire dance of energy (of which all matter & all of matter's formations are further *aspects* of this Cosmic Energy Dance).<br>  <br>  Many theistic believers *do* experience something (in the divine energy vibrations) that atheist believers are *blind* to -- much as a person blind from birth may never be able to experience color.  Atheists are like the white blood cells that *only* believe in the blood & the vessels the blood circulates thru -- *doubting* the existence of "human beings" because there's no way to "prove" human existence to them.  Theism is one (flawed) attempt to understand That Which Is Larger than ourselves -- relative to which *some* have intuitions, inklings, cosmic consciousness experiences, near death experiences, feelings of divine enwrapment & Presence... and, indeed, that "still small voice" which some Christians have spoken of, "whispering" Good Counsel, Good Guidance to them.<br>  <br>  The Divine Spirit *is* "speaking" for every human being to receive Direct Personal Divine Guidance at *all* times!  But how many are *really* listening?!  The motivation has to come from *within* oneself -- this deepest of desires for the actual Larger Truth.|`|AYFgrhMFaa	I agree with PaulCyp down there, with one addition. As you can see, people didn't think that a perfect being was all that fantastic (hey, didn't we murder the last one by crucifixtion/asphyxiation). It wasn't just a choice, it was the better way to go, because we would be better able to understand a imperfect being, and therefore be more open to the Holy Word|`|zfFjKhJJaa	First of all, just because we are imperfect doesnt mean we are incapable of spreading God's word<br>  <br>  Secondly, this life is nothing except a drop in the vast ocean of eternity.

Maybe each one of us is perfect in his or her own way.  Maybe the concept of perfection includes the potential for change.  Who are we to find God's creation anything less than perfect.

I think God give us messages when we need them. I don't think they necessarily come through others...sometimes He delivers them himself if we are open to it. I do not believe that hell is a place where unbelievers go after death. I think hell is a separation from God, so in a sense, we are in there right now. <br>  ~Peace~|`|6zoZ75JQaa	First of all, we aren't under the ten commandments.Jesus"nailed" the old testament(which includes the ten commandments) to the cross when he was crucified(Colossians 2:14--"having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross."). Then in Hebrews Chapter 8 it talks about his new covenant...8:8-13 "But God found fault with the people and said: 'The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Isreal and with the house of Judah.  It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. This is the covenant I will make with the house of Isreal after that time, declares the Lord.  I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts.  I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.  For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.'  By calling this covenant 'new', he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear."<br>  <br>  With that being said, one reason I can imagine God "allows" imperfect beings carry his message--would you want to listen to someone who is absolutely perfect? Do you really think someone who is perfect can relate to everyone else?? NO! People would not listen to God's messengers if they were perfect. I know I wouldn't. Unbelievers tend to listen to the guy who's been through what they've been through. When you go through hard times you can easily sympathize with someone and they can see that God is still good! God can turn ANYthing bad into something good--something to be helpful and encouraging to others who are going through a tough time. <br>  Another reason he allows his messengers to be flawed--There's really no better way to reach out to unbelievers. I mean God could speak directly to them, but supposedly his appearance/voice causes trembling (Psalm 104:32, Jeremiah 5:22, Ezekiel 38:20, Nahum 1:5, Acts 7:32). When God appeared to his people they had to look away! he's just that....awesome! Plus, if God talked to you directly there would be no faith involved in believing in him (Romans 10:17 and John 20:29 "Then Jesus told him, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.'"). <br>  "Romans 10:14<br>  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?"<br>  God needs messengers, and he chose us flawed Christians on earth to do the job for him :)|`|IYe1TTwYaa	The reason why God used imperfect people to bring the Gospel is that they have been knocked dow enough times to have their hearts open to God's voice.<br>   People that claim to be perfect are so proud that they cannot hear God's voice accurately and add things that points out man's power and not God's.<br>   The so called imperfect ones are actually the perfect ones because their ears are open to God.|`|PkgBbVW0aa	First off I don't believe in hell or heaven. Second off the so called reason for imperfection came from a man named Adam. Another "perfect" man named jesus was to die for his sin to correct it. According to the big book of jewish story tales we are all still sinners. The correct answer does not lie with in a book nor does it lie within mankind it lies within all of us. If you want to believe in something believe in yourself and treat others as you would want to be treated. Your not going to end world suffering or world hunger or even poverty. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  That is the way governments work. <br>     Any of the Major performers in the big book of jewish tales were performers of witchcraft or so called miracles.  Moses turned a staff into a snake jesus turned water into wine.  The Wise craft or Witch craft wasn't frowned upon until the Catholic church was started by none other than a so called pagan.  The ten commandments are nothing more that someones idea to live by and that is that.|`|U51pBeLfaa	How people see the nature of God would influence how they view evangelism.<br>  Jesus is fully human and fully divine therefore evangelism is fully human and fully divine.<br>  <br>  On the one hand the human messengers have a role to play in carrying the message. In my opinion Christians should 'wait in Jerusalem until they are empowered by the Holy Spirit' before they start evangelizing. We are then called to witness what we have seen. I don't subscribe to the conversion theory.<br>  <br>  On the other God has a role in calling people. In the parable of the Sower: God is the Sower and only one in four personality types respond positively to the message. There is no convert or die message in this parable.<br>  <br>  I don't subscribe to the hellfire and brimstone preaching of some Christians. I think they have misinterpreted the scriptures. What those parables mean to me is that we Christians have an assurance of heaven - of being in the Kingdom of God. We "imperfect beings" don't decide who is in and who is out. God does that and it is presumptuous to think otherwise. Jesus probably used the Greek myth as a parable because everyone was familiar with it. Translating this allegory into something contemporary. Hell is a separation from God. If people choose to walk away from God then they get what they deserve.<br>  <br>  Using your analogy God as adult and humans as children: He entrusts the message to human "imperfect beings" for their benefit to learn something in the process. God is watching to ensure that the message goes through. He may send that person to the naughty corner if they stuff it up. He may use someone else. If you believe the bible then as a last resort He has come Himself.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	Your point about flawed messengers is one I've never considered, and reinforces my doubts about the existence of God.<br>  <br>  Over the six thousand years or so of belief in one very personal God, several such flawed messengers, from Abraham and Moses, to the a more recent unbelieving Archbishop of York, have all carried the word of God to a trusting flock. During that time, interpretation and opinion of God's message has separated out from Judaism to Christianity to Islam, then further fragmented to all the different subdivisions we see today, including the more extreme fundamentalists. Such separation must be a consequence of flawed messengers delivering ever more defective messages from God, since they all can't be right.<br>  <br>  It's hard to reconcile, love thy neighbour with the atrocities committed by Jewish, Catholic, Protestant and Muslim fundamentalists, in the name of the same God. Each of the subdivisions, sects if you like, have become atheistically inclined to God as worshipped by the others, they only believe in their version of God's message. The notion of God seems to have become smaller somehow.<br>  <br>  The fear of God you mention, motivated the less enlightened followers of the Old Testament, it seemed to work quite well. The terrible fear of an eternity in hell if not obeying God's messenger, is an example of the learned leading the ill-informed by wicked and devious means. Jesus, a good and learned Jew, must have seen how ridiculous and illogical damnation really is, he changed the whole concept of a wrathful God into a loving forgiving God, and this obviously became very popular.<br>  <br>  Your last point about 'lost in translation' is very true, for me the bible sound more plausible in earlier versions than more recent ones. Somehow it's lost any remaining credence in modern English. This loss of authenticity further degrades the message in the scriptures since it has become open to imperfect translation and personal interpretation down the ages by as you say, flawed messengers.<br>  <br>  Have you wondered who originally decided which books should be included in, and which excluded from the bible? The Apocrypha accepted as canonical by Roman Catholics but not by Protestants. It all makes very little sense to me.|`|AA11232725	The Bible teaches that all people are flawed and in need of a Savior.

While we were still sinners, God sent His son to die on a cross for us.  The bible teaches, we love Him because He first loved us.

With so many different beliefs and one creator, one would think that there must not be several rules or various religions, but one true religion that we were to all adhere to, but that is not the case.  I don't wonder why some don't want to believe, and I accept it, because that is their decision to do so.  A believers quest is to not be the messenger, but to be the student, always.

(rabble-rouser!)|`|mMnRmYvNaa	The religionists would tell you that the original people to whom the message was delivered --- Moses, Jesus, Muhammad were not really that imperfect -- so they would dispute your most basic supposition contained in the question.<br>  <br>  Obviously the later persons who claim to be repeating the message like Rabbi Kahane, or Jerry Falwell, or Osama Bin Laden, would be judged quite imperfect by many persons of sound judgment and goodwill. <br>  <br>  If God wanted to control every single molecule of the entire universe at every single picosecond so that all mankind lived in a perfect straightjacket at every moment, there's no point in creating man in the first place. Freedom is the essence of being human and in the image of God. <br>  <br>  So the first messengers would be meeting a high standard of perfection -- but the repeaters of the message thousands of years later might be highly flawed -- in fact total sinners (especially Falwell). It's just part of the freedom thing.<br>  <br>  Atheists like me, would joust around with your question just for your entertainment. The whole question is based on false suppositions, since according to us, there is no God. <br>  <br>  Properly speaking we think of ourselves more along the lines of adelusionists or afantasists. It's not just God we don't believe in, we also don't believe in the Easter Bunny, Unicorns, Poltergeists, Werewolves, Vampires, Satan, or Santa Claus. So atheist is too narrow a term to describe us precisely. We are A-All Delusions and A-All Fantasies.<br>  <br>  This does not mean we believe nothing at all. We are fully prepared to believe all things for which there is adequate and sufficient evidence. We are not at all prepared to believe anything for which there is no credible evidence (like God, the Easter Bunny, Unicorns etc).<br>  <br>  It does not mean we have absolutely no spiritual lives. The human spirit can respond to the harmonies of the universe. A lot of A-Fantasists are living in wonder at the unity of the universe and its splendour. So when you see us, behold the spirit, and the spirituality that is in our hearts -- maybe not like a jew, christian, or moslem, but more like a Taoist (see Benjamin Hoff) or Zen Buddhist (see Alan Watts), or advaita Hindu (see also Shankara, and the Upanishads).<br>  <br>  Here to tilt at windmills for your pleasure, I'm Don Roberto, of La Manhattanancha!

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|qEdhPD8Laa	..."you should look at more than the face of the earth."

We are not supernatural beings who turn into bats and suck the blood from the living.  We do drink blood, but that may be the only similarity to fictional vampires.  We have family and friends, pets and jobs just like everyone else.  Vampires are just like everyone else, except we need to have a little bit more to live healthily.  <br>  There are two main types of real vampires.  The most well known is the sanguinarian vampire.  Sanguinarians are the vampires that feel the need to drink the blood of others.  I myself am a sanguinarian vampire.  I do drink human blood.  I do not hunt humans in the night to drain them of blood, nor do I kill rats in the sewer to consume their blood.  Sanguinarians only get their blood from WILLING donors.  I drink from my fiancé.  I myself, enjoy sucking blood, so I will use a sterile razor blade  to make a small cut on her arm or her back and I will lap up the blood.  Some vampires use other methods to get their blood.  I do not drink blood every day.  <br>  The other type of vampire is the psychic vampire.  Psychic vampires, I do not know much about, but they feed off the psychic energy that everyone gives off.  They have some way in which they draw peoples energy away from them and into their bodies.  <br>  We cannot turn someone into a vampire.  You have to be born a vampire.  No one bit me, and I have never bit anyone (aside from my fiancé, in the bedroom *wink wink*).  There is no known way to turn someone, and even if we could, it would be no different from the life a person already lives.  <br>  Vampires are not like story books and movies, however.  Vampires cannot fly (except on an airplane), we do not live forever, we do not turn into bats and fly around, we do not fry like a piece of chicken in the sunlight, we do not fear the cross or run for the wind from garlic.  We have reflections and we are in every sense, just like regular people.  We will die if we get shot, just like everyone else, we bleed, we cry, we love, we pray.  We come in every shape, color, size, and age just like everyone else.  There are ugly vampires, and pretty vampires, fat and thin vampires, black and white vampires, old and young vampires, Christian and Jewish vampires, and gay and straight vampires.  We get colds, and the flu, suffer arthritis and cancer.  We are not immune to any disease.  We have normal jobs.  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand real vampires.  There are many websites that you can find more information.  You can also email me.  I will respond as soon as I can to any questions.  <br>  www.sanguinarius.org<br>  www.slad.net<br>  www.vampirecommunity.com|`|u8EvXT6paa	No he is not bs-ing you. You should really look under the suface we are out there. We are everywhere you could imagan. Its true that they have this image of what we look and act like but it just isn't like that. We walk among you. We are in you schools, jobs, and in you favorite places to hang out. We look like ordanary people and we try our hardest to blend in with the human race. No! Not all of us are as bad as the tv shows and movies say we are. there are some of us that don't even drink human blood. There are alternat sources of food there are many different ways and things that we can get our nutrition from. As time moves on you may never really see a vampire. Only time will tell. If you realy want to see one than all you have to do is look, whatch the behaviors of the people around you. Oh and no you can't tell just by looking. You shouldn't ask ether you humans arn't supose to know about our existance.
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Vampires of any stripe do not exist. There are no immortal undead ones, no subhuman sanguinarians, no psychic aura feeders. It is all a delusion powered by the human ability to rationalize out what they want to believe, instead of accepting the hard truth. <br>  "Witches" are not real. There are people who practice Wicca, but it is a religious choice and does not "confer" upon you the ability to cast spells. If magic were real we'd have drive-by fireballings, teleporting, polymorphing, and who knows what craziness unleashed every day.<br>  Fairies do not exist. There are no spriggans, leprechauns, Sidhe, pooka, redcaps, goblins, eshu, boggans, etc.<br>  Werewolves do not exist. The human body cannot undergo such radical changes to its physical structure in so short a time without dying.<br>  <br>  People have good imaginations, always have, always will - but there is absolutely no evidence for any of this. Now, if you believe in God, angels, and demons, then I suppose you could theorize that manifestations of the angelic hosts and their fallen brethren here on earth could account for such sightings, but according to that milieu, God does not allow such flagrant and frequent interactions with humans. After all, He wants to preserve free will, according to the Bible, and the demons wouldn't want to tip humans off that they exist, either.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Vampires as portrayed in the movies - no.<br>  <br>  Fairies - doubtful.<br>  <br>  Witches, yes, but not as portrayed in the movies or in Halloween pictures.

Within 5 years the number of whites drastically decreased in my neighborhood. By the end of 8 years there was 1 white family left. At the time my family and I felt a little rejected but so little we didn't make mention of it. It wasn't only happening to us but all over.<br>  <br>  They tried to keep the education fair by busing some of us to the white schools but they would move from there as well so in less than two years a mixed high school was predominantly black.<br>  <br>  Then I got my degree and tried to move into a better neighborhood. It was like pulling teeth out of a brick. I talked to many white people who seemed nice as I could tell. They didn't know what I was trying to do. But when I talked with them extensively, I found that those that I spoke with didn't have a problem with black people as a whole. They had a problem with the ghetto folk that follow (paraphrasing).<br>  <br>  You see the middle class neighborhood I moved into when I was a kid soon became a poor class neighborhood within 15 years. <br>  <br>  When I shop, I like to go to the better stores. There aren't a whole lot of black people there. Why do I go there? Because the selection is better even though the prices aren't. Clam dip, Absorbine Jr., better Dollar Tree Stores aren't in black areas amongst other things.<br>  <br>  I have been places where I was grunted at for being there soley because of my skin color and I felt so much better to see another black person there. At the same time, when I moved in the better neighborhood, I wince if I see more than the usual black folk I saw when I got there.<br>  <br>  It is comfortable being around your own people but you also have to bring a better quality of behavior.

Its not cool to have a hoopdee conk out on the curb and it becomes art, or to take you dining chairs and play cards in the driveway or have a barbeque on the front porch - you know what I am saying.

QqxZzvbAaa	Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, says she derived her teaching from the Bible. In practice she feels her revelations were better than the Bible: Miscellaneous Writings 1833-1896, p. 170:19-21 "the material record of the Bible, …is no more important to our well being than the history of Europe and America." <br>  <br>  The late Dr. Walter Martin compares Christian Science with Gnosticism, a teaching that sprang up in the early church era. Gnosticism claimed to have a superior knowledge even to that of the apostles, giving them an inner knowledge of the nature of God and Jesus Christ. They taught that the physical world was evil. The apostles, Martin says, understood that any denial of the material world attacked the incarnation. Basically, according to Dr. Martin's seminal work The Kingdom of the Cults, Christian Science teaches that "Jesus is not God. The incarnation and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ did not occur." They teach that we are all part of God's being and all share in His divine nature. This teaching is not biblical. <br>  <br>  In The Handbook of Today's Religions, authors Josh McDowell and Don Stewart say this about Christian Science: "Christian Science is neither Christian nor scientific because every important doctrine of historic Christianity is rejected by Christian Science. The claim of divine revelation by Mrs. Eddy is contradicted by the facts that clearly attest she does not represent the God of the Bible. Although she speaks in the name of Jesus, her teachings conflict with His in every respect." <br>  <br>  Fortunately, Jesus warned us ahead of time about people like Mrs. Eddy: "Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits" (Matthew 7:15-16. <br>  <br>  I gave you a copy and paste to show you how "christian science" got started .<br>  my personal oppinion is it is a cult and has nothing to do with christianity.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|8179167c86c2a954054ffc06276ae83caa	another deception from the freemason / occult crowd. mary baker eddy prophesied that cs would be the dominant religion within 50 years, and she lived in the 1800s. another false prophet. heed jesus' warning and steer clear.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Round squares|`|AA11502346	It isn't Biblical.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum.

They killed a man because he wouldn't have sex with his sister! God kills 70,000 innocent people because David ordered a census of the people (1 Chronicles 21).  God also orders the destruction of 60 cities so that the Israelites can live there.  He orders the killing of all the men, women, and children of each city, and the looting of all of value (Deuteronomy 3).  He orders another attack and the killing of “all the living creatures of the city: men and women, young, and old, as well as oxen sheep, and asses” (Joshua 6).  In Judges 21, He orders the murder of all the people of Jabesh-gilead, except for the virgin girls who were taken to be forcibly raped and married.  When they wanted more virgins, God told them to hide alongside the road and when they saw a girl they liked, kidnap her and forcibly rape her and make her your wife!  Just about every other page in the Old Testament has God killing somebody!  In 2 Kings 10:18-27, God orders the murder of all the worshipers of a different god in their very own church!

Honestly, it can't be proven because "GOD" and religion is not all ideas and opinions, and according to basic rules, facts can be proven, opinions cannot. There are ways to prove that biblical events never happened but you cannot prove whether god had done them or not. I myself, I'm atheist. I believe that religion is honestly the source of evil and that no good ever comes from it. It starts wars, causes hatred, and most of all lets people believe that indifference is a bad thing. But this isn't about my beliefs lol <br>  The real answer to your question is, the only way you can prove whether or not biblical events had ever happened or not is to find solid facts using reliable sources of information such as books from very intelligent researchers and authors.<br>  <br>  As for knowing whether or not a so called "God" made this happen, is not provable, for the existence of a God is only an opinion not a fact.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :]|`|1xDtS8wwaa	Really, the issue isn't that atheists have to prove that these events never happened.

Z4avhg3eaa	The dharma can be misunderstood, misapplied, and clung to just as easily as any other doctrine.  When this happens, the results are disastrous. One poster on this thread pointed out some of them: debasement of justice, the belief that disabilities are a result of karma, etc.<br>  <br>  When this happens, even the highest of Buddhist thought becomes just another fetter of religious imprisonment.  It goes against the spirit and the letter of what the Buddha taught--Buddhism as a religion as opposed to a community of people working to eliminate suffering in themselves and showing others how to do that as well.|`|to8CkYp2aa	An argument has been made that the emphasis on karma and rebirth has led in places to the debasement of justice in this life, and that instead of changing things here and now, the downtrodden have been taught to take things and hope for something better in the next life.<br>  <br>  I've also met Buddhists that thought that the disabled are being punished for bad deeds in a previous llife.<br>  <br>  (That said, my wife is Buddhist, and I respect her spirituality as much as one could.)|`|y1JJhQ0Vaa	I have nothing against Buddhism, but nobody's been able to come up with an argument against this guy either-www.timecube.com. So I don't think this means much.<br>  <br>  <br>  On a more serious note, unless I'm mistaken, Buddhist doctrine is mainly psychological principles, which are difficult to argue with. This doesn't prove its truth.|`|pfNnuD5saa	I will agree with Teh Manuel. The acceptance of pain and suffering as part of life stop the drive for charity and ending suffering. It will promote a form of prejudice if you assume that a handicapped person is paying off bad Karma from a past life.|`|knOdcrDkaa	There is a book called The Happiness Hypothesis that argues that the Buddha was wrong about all desires bringing pain.|`|I9WjPm7Caa	Of course. Buddhism spends a lot of time arguing against the existence of a soul or self as an immortal quasi-physical entity that gets transferred from one existence to another. So far so good.<br>  <br>  Then, when it gets to present its own theory of what happens at death, it blows it spectacularly by positing the existence of a bundling of consciousness-impulses called the gandhabba (or gandharva) which then enters the new one-cell body. Oh, right and that is not a soul?<br>  <br>  But why are you looking for a perfect religion? There is no such thing, any more than there is a perfect philosophy, or a perfect scientific theory. All of them are vague approximations of the true state of affairs, subject to constant improvement and rethinking.<br>  <br>  IMHO anyway.|`|74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	There is no evidence for the existence of karma, moksha, reincarnation, or nirvana that could not be described better by actual, observable phenomena.  Hence, none of these concepts actually exist.<br>  <br>  Don't get me started on past life regression, because that is absolutely bogus.  No one ever "recalls" being a poor peasant or a cripple.  Why is it that everyone is either the king of France or someone that made international news?|`|1xDtS8wwaa	You'd have a hard time with it. So far, Buddhism's only been shown to have more validity regarding our existence than any other religion (with the exception of Taoism). If you look at Indian Buddhism (which is quite different from Chinese and Japanese Buddhism), it has a lot in common with what we'd call quantum mechanics.<br>  <br>  You could argue against the more institutionalized sects of Buddhism, such as the ones that believe in a pantheon of gods and demons. You're going to have a difficult time arguing against philosophical sects of Buddhism or Mahayana sects, which is pretty much just quantum physics clothed in parable and poetry.|`|Cgz1n3xNaa	Um. . . . <br>  <br>  <br>  Chanting sounds funny.|`|AQIhcBiuaa	Who would want to argue with a Buddhist?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  It would be hard to argue with a Buddist, I don't think you would have an easy time getting them to argue back.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I'm no expert on Buddhism but from the little I do know about it, there are a few things that strike me as a bit out of whack. <br>  There seems to be an inordinate amount of emphasis on suffering. The idea that life leads to suffering and that life just is suffering does not match my own experiences. The majority of teachings revolve around how to alleviate suffering by escaping the cycle of rebirth and I just don't agree that life is suffering. Then there are also these ideas about desires all leading to suffering and while I would agree that many cravings and desires are not beneficial, this is not always true. Having drive and desiring things can be a good thing and eliminating ones gut instinct for seeking out that which we desire can lead to a very complacent and hopeless person. <br>  <br>  Overall there is much I agree with in Buddhism. My father was Buddhist and it brought him much happiness, but I think it has potential for some oddness. Life is not suffering.

Z8qBgv8taa	I'd like to point out that we have an ability to find what we're looking for in anything. You can find the numbers 9 and 11 on anything. you can add subtract multiply and divide anything to find these numbers if that's what your mind is set on. As for time we have an internal clock and if you feed into that time your body will form a habit to check the clock at this time. I did it for months after 9-11.<br>  That said:<br>  <br>  <br>  Number 9<br>  <br>  You are all about spirituality. Those on the number 9 Life path are destined to travel a humanitarian path. These sophisticated individual are very selfless souls and are often patient, trustworthy and honorable from the very beginning to the end of their life.<br>  <br>  These individuals make great environmentalists, teachers, artists, priests and healers. Sometimes a nine's lofty ideals are presented in a manner that others find absurd.<br>  <br>  Part of a 9's life path is to express spiritual principles through actions, rather than through preaching or proselytizing.<br>  <br>  Number 11<br>  <br>  You are about enlightenment. Elevens tend to lead a life of extremes. In their quest to find a balance between the rational and the irrationality they will often pursue the most eclectic of religions and cultures.<br>  <br>  These avant-garde and visionary individuals make great students, psychics, mystics, healers, teachers, writers, musicians and artists.<br>  <br>  Many of them are "wounded healers" who at some point in their life suffer a devastating experience that propels them on the search for spirituality. However along with these situations usually comes a lot of toxic emotional baggage and a harsh inner critic.<br>  <br>  It takes many 11's their entire life to rid themselves of the chip on their shoulder and achieve enlightenment.|`|RGdowtivaa	get a life. you shouldnt worry about these things. maybe theres a reason you allways look at the ssame time.your brain might have gotten into a habit or something happens in your life everyday near this time...like husband or kids getting home.. other stuff..<br>  buuut also 911 9/11 is when the terrorists bombed the trade center.|`|26tmsARFaa	Matrix+ all you think about is 911 or9/11 or 9:11 relax its more subliminal than any thing else|`|gAY7XyDpaa	well its an important date in american history...could just be coincidence|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	you're seeing the #s everywhere simply because you're noticing them, that's all. they mean nothing. ppl assign meaning to all sorts of events-especially those that recur. <br>  <br>  in fact, they've been doing that for millinnia. you might find interesting spiritual info in numerology (the ancient study of #s). there are some good free websites to detail what each # means. <br>  <br>  generally, 9 is a number of completion-since the #s only go up to 9 & anything over that is added together (except for 2 specific #s). <br>  <br>  look it up. it'll mean more to you if you get the info yourself instead of someone simply telling you. also, don't go overboard. it's not a science.|`|Yi7AR18qaa	It could either be, your lucky number or a coincidence.
7RbootLlaa	Best thing not to go callling him a moron otherwise you could find yourself in hot water. People that appear to be nuisances like that, will just make them want to keep ringing you more if you tell them to nick off.<br>  Just refer him to someone else, put him on hold and don't answer him, be polite and tell him he has the wrong department and fob him off, tell him politely that you keep calling with the same questions and I can not help you and tell him I am putting the phone down OR find out what his number is and put a block on it. That way when he goes to phone you, it gets blocked and you don't get his phone call. (Contact your telephone company for details).|`|Gbln5NyZaa	Give him some sort of answer.  Tell him to call someone else if your solution doesn't work out for him.  If he calls back, keep on urging him to call someone else.  Or, you could pretend to be a recorded message and say that the number has been disconnected and give him a number to someone else.|`|AA11230150	You say you work in politics so do something political.  Spin him something. Use your imagination.|`|sTwAwLq4aa	your annoying stop talking to me<br>  <br>  that should do it :)|`|qL8NaVcMaa	Write him a letter back explaining that your department or office does not deal with the problem that he is having. Take a stab at directing him to another department, if you cannot get enough from his letter to send him elsewhere, then include a directory of some sort so he can call around himself to find out who can help with his concerns. <br>  At that point if he continues calling I would say just ignore him unless you have a supervisor who is telling you otherwise. Being in politics I'm sure it must be understood that there are the occasional people who just cannot be helped. Though if you feel his behavior is harassing you may want to let your local law enforcement know, about a year ago a guy was harassing some local gov offices in my area, he eventually went to a town hall meeting and shot a few people.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	No, there's no polite way to tell someone he is a moron.<br>  <br>  It's your JOB to deal with the public, and to do so as effectively and politely as possible. Sorry, you don't get to pre-screen people, and have to deal with the bewildered, as well as the clear-minded.<br>  <br>  All you can do is, explain that his thing isn't part of the thing that your thing deals with (sorry, but your question has no relevant details, replace 'thing' with appropriate words and phrases), and explain where he CAN find help (or whatever).<br>  <br>  You can't tell him not to call or write any more; but the more you help him contact whoever can help him, the better your chances he'll start bugging them, instead.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Refer him to someone else

You would be wise NOT to even bother explaining it to the dimwit at the lunch table. She sounds like she has her own rules.<br>  <br>  You also do not have to explain that you do not wish to discuss.

Q4VwhcbXaa	well I am not sure of the best places to check, perhaps seaching on line under exploration or foreign relations.  I know much more of british history than Japanese and I would say off the top of my head that the British were not isolationists as the Japanese tended to be.  The British and Europeans in general explored much and tried to expand their empire beyond their island.  This brought them often great wealth but lead to many wars as well.  <br>  <br>  Also I think the common religion and fealty to the Pope and the significant intermarriage between the European royals also impacted foreign relations with nearby countries.  There was much intermarriage and often the kings or queens of a country would not even speak the native language, I feel certain this could not have happened in Japan.
rNXCnJ8Eaa	It sucked.<br>  <br>  For a show that was created by lesbians, revolved around lesbians, and was marketed towards everyone from gay men and women to straight men and women, the finale certainly did not do the show justice and quite frankly, it was disappointing.<br>  <br>  Jenny's death was overly hyped to begin with, and then there was never a pay off.|`|DWwv3v9Raa	I totally agree with you, it was a very big let down to say the least.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why this was the hyped up finale that we now have to go online to see if we can get the true ending for the very short lived series.  :-(<br>  <br>  Apparently you have to go to the show.com website to see the interrogation.|`|Mpl6auhBaa	*headdesk*<br>  <br>  It was an AWFUL episode; that doesn't even qualify as a proper finale! <br>  <br>  I really felt like we needed an epilogue; there were so many questions left unanswered.<br>  <br>  For instance, Kit now believes Bette cheated on Tina. Is she going to say anything? Will Bette and Tina rethink their move now that Jenny's gone and they want to keep their friendships tight (and as Angie called Kit's boyfriend "Daddy")? Will Shane try to go back to Molly? Are Alice and Tasha REALLY going to make it? Who owns Jenny's house now? Where will Shane have to move? When Max has the baby, will Bette and Tina adopt it? Will he finally get his full surgery? What's happening with Helena and Dylan? What about Shane and Nikki? Will Bette and Tina find another baby to adopt? <br>  <br>  And, most of all, who ACTUALLY KILLED JENNY???<br>  <br>  The whole episode was shoddily done and looked as though it had been slapped together at the last minute.

Z8qBgv8taa	The Ecuadorian-Peruvian War, fought between July 5, 1941 and July 31, 1942, was one of three military conflicts that occurred between these two South American nations during the 20th century.<br>  <br>  During the 7-week war, Peru invaded and occupied the western Ecuadorian province of El Oro and parts of the Andean province of Loja and advanced into the Amazonian area occupied by Ecuador according to a status quo agreement signed in 1936.<br>  <br>  WHY:<br>  The dispute between Ecuador and Peru dates from 1840. Much of the dispute revolved around whether Ecuador's territory extended beyond the Andes mountain range to the Mara?on (Amazon) river, including the Amazonian basin.<br>  <br>  The Cenepa War (January 26 – February 28, 1995), also known as the Alto Cenepa War, was a brief and localized military conflict between Ecuador and Peru, fought over control of a disputed area on the border between the two countries. Same reason as before. <br>  <br>  The Paquisha War was a brief military clash that took place in January-February 1981 between Ecuador and Peru over the control of three watchposts that the Ecuadorian Army was setting up in the Comaina valley, to the east of the Condor mountain range, inside a disputed border area.

FOzN3xwzaa	Catholicism is not Christian. Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that cannot save you (Galatians 1:6-9). <br>  <br>  Catholicism cannot save. Only believing in Jesus alone for salvation, can save you. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  PROOF THAT CATHOLICS WERE NOT "THE FIRST CHRISTIANS":<br>  <br>  It's obvious from the Book of Acts in the Bible that catholics didn't even exist during the days of Acts. Those in the Book of Acts are the first Christians, and they believed what would be called fundamentalist doctrine today. ANYONE can read the Book of Acts for themselves and see. Had catholicism existed during the time of Acts, the first Christians would have rejected catholicism completely. <br>  <br>  Also here's Christians that called the "pope" the antichrist, and who also completely rejected catholicism, long before Martin Luther was even born:<br>  <br>  c. 1310<br>  Dante Alighieri <br>  c. 1331<br>  Michael of Cesena <br>  c. 1345<br>  Johannes de Rupescissa <br>  c. 1350<br>  Francesco Petrarch <br>  c. 1367<br>  John Milicz <br>  c. 1379<br>  John Wycliffe <br>  c. 1388<br>  Matthias of Janow <br>  c. 1389<br>  R. Wimbledon <br>  c. 1390<br>  John Purvey <br>  c. 1393<br>  Walter Brute <br>  c. 1412<br>  John Huss <br>  c. 1497<br>  Girolamo Savonarola<br>  <br>  So not only is it false to say that "catholics were the first Christians", but this list blows away the catholic claim that "no churches existed other than the catholic church, until Martin Luther". <br>  <br>  There were ALWAYS saved believers outside the catholic cult, who knew catholicism cannot save anyone. Catholicism is not Christian. Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that cannot save (Galatians 1:6-9).|`|AA10052130	Broadly speaking, Christians do the will of God; Catholics do the will of the Pope.  Christians base their beliefs and practices on the Word of God; Catholics base their beliefs and practices on the traditions of men.<br>  <br>  Ash Wednesday in just one such practice.  It is not biblical at all, but founded upon heathen religions.  But the actual practice as done today, has a convoluted history that has been developed and changed over many centuries.<br>  <br>  It is the beginning of the 40 days of "fasting" prior to the Easter celebration.  The practice of the 40 days of penance seems to have originated in a tradition of fasting before Passover, the solemn ceremonial memorial of Jesus' sacrifice.  Some Christians were in the practice of fasting up until the time of the taking of the Passover bread and wine.  Others extended that time of fasting, but to a lesser degree (only abstaining from one or more foods).  The period of "fasting" continued to grow until it came to its present 40 days.  Of course, in that time,, the Passover was also neglected and a tradition of celebrating the "resurrection" of Jesus was substituted instead.<br>  .|`|LFC1AcmGaa	Not Much. A Catholic priest edited their Bible and yet they still think Catholicism is the "Whore of Babylon" lol<br>  <br>  The text of the King James Version was edited by Desiderius Erasmus, a Roman Catholic priest who was ordained in 1492, who used very few texts before he rushed it off to the printer.<br>  Textus Receptus has many versions and they are all full of errors, and Erasmus usually brought them in line with the Latin Vulgate before rushing them off to the printer.<br>  <br>  Erasmus also lacked a complete copy of the book of Revelation and was forced to translate the last six verses back into Greek from the Latin Vulgate in order to finish his edition. Erasmus adjusted the text in many places to correspond with readings found in the Vulgate, or as quoted in the Church Fathers; and consequently, although the Textus Receptus is classified by scholars as a late Byzantine text, it differs in nearly two thousand readings from standard form of that text type; as represented by the "Majority Text" of Hodges and Farstad (Wallace 1989). The edition was a sell-out commercial success; and was reprinted in 1519, with most—though not all—the typographical errors corrected.<br>  <br>  The gospels say, for example in the Gospel of John that, after Jesus died, the disciples went fishing.<br>  The only talk of them preaching about Jesus’ resurrection from the dead is found in the final verses to the Gospel of Mark, which were added later.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	You want to know why Christians can never get anything done?<br>  <br>  It's because they bicker and fight over these kinds of insignificant differences in their denominations.

Some people like to point out that none of this ritual is necessary for salvation which I believe is quite true.<br>  <br>  I feel that the differences between Catholicism and Christianity become smaller as Catholics read their bibles and put their faith into practice.

The goal of every Christian is to become Christ like.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Sorry about "Bride of Squidwards" reaction.<br>  Some Catholics are sensitive about people insinuating that Catholics aren't Christians when in fact Catholics were the FIRST Christians before all the other denominations and interpretations. <br>  The Reality is,  ALL Catholics are Christians, while not all Christians are Catholic. <br>  In the future, a more precise term is "non-catholic christian"  OR, as Catholics tend to call them... "Protestants"  which lumps ALL the non-catholic denominations of Christianity together and is less wordy then "non catholic christian"<br>  <br>  But I understand what you meant. <br>   <br>  Well the POPE kind encompasses A LOT of differences all right there. <br>  A lot of differences originate from the break with the Papacy. Once you don't recognize that their is any 1 person who can settle disagreements in interpretation...then a lot of other separations occurr because of that.<br>  <br>  For one thing, without the Office of the Pope, the position itself,  You and I have no way to settle who is right and who is wrong when we have differences in the way we interpret scripture. Therefore, all we can do is SPLIT apart when we have a disagreement. <br>  This has led to approximately 38,000 different denominations of Christianity registered thru the IRS in the US alone. <br>  Each one thinks THEY have interpreted scripture correctly. <br>  - What a mess.<br>  <br>  Protestants claim that if you pray God, he will HELP you to interpret the bible..but we have to look at the sheer number of churches and denominations out there and consider how LIKELY we feel that to be true if all 38,000 are claiming to be RIGHT.<br>  <br>  Another major difference is in the belief in the Sacraments vs. "sole fide"  or "faith alone" doctrine. <br>  <br>  Catholics can show biblical as well as historical proof that Christians have always believed that the Sacraments impart ACTUAL grace on people from God. God has promised that he will give people the grace to live holy lives to those who partake in his sacraments.  Protestants on the other hand believe that only FAITH is needed.  Grace can not be imparted by anything we DO, any action of ours.  Grace comes SOLELY from the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Protestants ALSO believe that "works" or "action" are not needed,  ONLY faith. Faith is what saves you. Actions are merely the result of having faith.  <br>  <br>  Catholics see Salvation as resting on 3 things.  Love, Faith, and Works. <br>  Love leads to Faith, faith and love then lead to works.  Thus all 3 are necessary, not 1 over the other.  Separating out Faith from works is arbitrary and silly. Faith and works to a Catholic are intrinsic. What we believe often times leads us to act.  However, actions, can often times lead us to deeper faith.<br>  <br>  The Protestant view of "faith alone" is narrower then the Catholic view. Therefore Catholics can easily agree with Protestants that "faith" is critical, and therefore encompass their view.  This is because Protestants broke away from Catholicism, so Catholicism is the Mother church. Protestants have a harder time incorporating the Catholic view however because their beliefs can be seen as a subset of the church they broke away from. <br>  <br>  The Catholic church decided what went into the bible, compiled it,  and spread it throughout the world. Protestantism came along roughly 1200 years later and established "sole scriptura" or "bible alone" doctrine. <br>  They believe EVERYTHING has to be found in the bible. <br>  <br>  Here's where their doctrine takes an interesting twist though. <br>  They reject the infallible (perfect) interpretation of the position of the Pope, and believe that EACH person interprets scripture on their own. <br>  However, in doing so, they ACT as if their "personal" interpretation is infallible. Therefore instead of saying just 1 infallible teaching is wrong, they seem to in fact, set themselves up as  a source of infallible interpretation. <br>  They will argue, vehemently that their interpretation is RIGHT,  while rejecting the fact that the Catholic church's views have any grounds and put the church down for following the Pope.<br>  <br>  Also, ironic is the fact that they claim the church which compiled, and decided what went into the bible, has any authority or say on how to interpret the book, it essentially created.  -- I find that more then a bit ironic. <br>  <br>  SO, Protestants,  who claim that we shouldn't follow a man and should interpret things on their own,  Seem to think that extends to everyone BUT the Catholic church.<br>  <br>  Rather then saying "we will agree to disagree" they use their interpretation as if it is infallible and immutable FACT.<br>  <br>     :::EDIT:::<br>  <br>  One last difference between Protestants and Catholicism.. Because thru the help of the Popes, Catholics have largely stayed unified over the centuries, it has allowed the church to expand and get bigger then most Non-Catholic Christian organizations. While some Christians churches may consider themselves "mega-churches" because they have 500-1000 people attending them...<br>  The Catholic church is an international organization, encompassing close to 1 billion people. <br>  It is the largest non-governmental provider of Education, Healthcare, Food, and Charity in the WORLD.<br>  1 in 5 patients in the US is treated in a Catholic Hospital. <br>  nearly 20% of the Nation is taught in Catholic schools. <br>  The Catholic church runs one of the World's Busiest Pharmacies in the world, right at the Vatican itself, open to the public and staffed by 40 priests. <br>  It is involved in African nations where there is stavation, genocide, and plagues. <br>  <br>  While many non-catholic christians talk about "faith alone"  and how they help pregnant teens in their community, -- The Catholic church is rolling up her sleeves,  digging into the world's problems and trying to make a difference.|`|AA11440601	?

Ash Wednesday ? <br>  <br>  As the beginning of Lent, Ash Wednesday calls us to the conversion journey that marks the season. <br>  <br>  As those preparing to join the Church enter the final stage of their preparation for the Easter sacraments, we are all called to walk with them so that we will be prepared to renew our baptismal promises when Easter arrives.<br>  <br>  When we receive ashes on our foreheads, we remember:<br>  ? Who we are<br>  ? That we are creatures of the earth<br>  .     "Remember that you are dust"<br>  ? That we are mortal beings<br>  .     "and to dust you will return"<br>  ? That we are baptized<br>  ? That we are people on a journey of conversion<br>  .     "Turn away from sin and be faithful to the gospel"<br>  ? That we are members of the body of Christ<br>  ? That smudge on our foreheads will proclaim that identity to others, too<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/CU/ac0204.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.americancatholic.org/Newslett...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Catholics are Christians!

jjDZJmfpaa	Its a funny question because I am sure many white people would like to know the answer to that as well.<br>  <br>  The funny part is, nary a white person would stake a claim in no other person of a mixed race before Obama.<br>  <br>  People have been fine calling Halle Berry, Mariah Carey, and Alicia Keyes black having a mixed family. <br>  <br>  It has always been because white people have made it known that their race is pure. Black people have had their issues as well, but for the most part, we are the ones who will accept if there is just a modicum of black in them (or any other race for that matter).<br>  <br>  I have noticed big changes in some people especially in the celebrities. It was not as big of an issue with Madonna adopting a black child, but we don't see that child anywhere not like the rest of her children.<br>  <br>  Brad and Angelina do much better though; and its action like those that pacify the societal constraints that used to plague this country. <br>  <br>  I hope people will make those changes as we see that a "black" president cannot do any worse than what has already been in office.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	Why are people getting mad about this? I mean really! A lot of black people are soooo proud that they have a black president.But then someone has to step in and say ":no no no sorry Hes half white,black people,nothing to be to proud of "! Geesh. Usually before mr. obama people that were mixed were just considered black,But now all of a sudden ...::sighs:: lol just forget it!|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	half blacks are african american too. African american is not 100% black. Avergae black american is 20% white. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Obama identified himself as black. "When I'm catching a cab in Manhattan they don't say, there's a mixed-race guy, I'll go pick him up,". "Or if I was an armed robber and they flashed my face on television, they'd have no problem labeling me as a black man. So if that's my identity when something bad happens, then that's my identity when something good happens as well.'' -------------Mr Barack H. Obama|`|VG7k5QRFaa	1. Whites created the rule that if "you have one drop of blood, you're black" as in the creation of disrespectful terms such as "octoroon,"  "mulatto," "quadroon" and "quintroon." <br>  <br>  2. White men raped black women and created mixed people... therefore their wives refused to accept them into the house while black people welcomed them with open arms.<br>  <br>  3. White women cheated on their husbands or snuck around with black men so white men refused to accept them into the race while black people welcomed them with open arms.<br>  <br>  4. Don't they call Halle Berry, Tiger Woods and Mariah Carey black?  They even chased Mariah and forced her from secrecy to show she was half black.  She snuck around singing with blacks at night and whites in the day.  Before she married / dated white guys.  Now she is married to a black guy and calls herself black.  Tough break?<br>  <br>  They gave up their claim on these people...though there are those who'll do anything to accepted by whites such as OJ Simpson, Halle Berry, Shar Jackson, Tiger Woods...OJ and Shar aren't mixed but they still reflect the type of personality that chases after whites who've turned their backs on them and rejected them.  Obama was raised by a white family, but was rejected by the older white elite society...even during the election.|`|a3adecd468f8217562e162004a849a7faa	Your statement in your question is true but something even more important that you should not overlook is that Obama came back to the Black side and sees himself as a Black man with a Black woman because of all the things he heard being said, by his own blood, about Black people when he was growing up that would "make his stomach cringe". Combine that with the negative experiences rooted in racial differences that they had growing up. There you have it, in the words of a man who has risen to be very successful such that he has nothing to gain from finger pointing or looking in the past for excuses anymore except in an effort to answer the question why he had to face all that pain. Let this be a lesson to us that we should always try exercise self-control and be kind to others who do not look like us.|`|B6BUR6zJaa	Because they want to you to believe that he is a naturally-born American citizen.<br>  <br>  ****************************<br>  <br>  My guess is that, by the time he is out of office, no group will want to claim him.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	He wouldnt be half white if he was a thug in the streets selling drugs. Now would he?|`|oFiStmkGaa	They're just being politically correct, it also appeals to a larger audience.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine if they said "Obama is the first part-white President of the United States"? Hmmm, I wonder why they don't say "Obama is the first part-black President of the United States"?|`|AA11476694	I agree. Why can't he just be an American. But I suppose that is the way he wanted it. How would it look if I said I am a white American. Someone would scream racism. Take a look at me and you could see that I am white. I know where you are coming from. It's always a two sided coin.|`|BCuIcYRqaa	Because he says he is<br>  Notice when he refers to him self he says<br>  <br>  "I am African American, and i have a white mother"<br>  these two things are said separately <br>  His been in America long enough to know that society will consider him as an african american|`|EzHyG66Uaa	Because, they're dolts. He isn't African-American nor a caucasian. He's mix--mix with both race genes.|`|HM2pvjWmaa	He looks black and if we consider that most African Americans are 1-20% white, that would make all biracial|`|ISJgDUZ5aa	Is "white" a social race? Sorry I'm confused.|`|gEd1jlOEaa	Does it really matter he is the President now let it be!|`|AA11786648	Maybe with this generaion people born in the late 80's and early 90's don't have a problem with accepting mixed people as they are but in older generations even though Obama is mixed he was only accepted as a black person and he learned to accept that as his identity.  That is just the way it was. 25 years from now when some of you 20 year olds want to run and you are mixed it will probably be really silly for you not to acknowledge your mixed heritage especially if you are ina 50/50 position and you have two parents who are 2 obviously different races. <br>  Unfortunatley, for Pres. Obama he was not really given the "ok" to just walk around saying well I'm also white he would have seemed silly then.  It must have been hard on himself since he went home everyday to a white family and the only black relative his dad left.  Then outside his home the people who really embraced him were blacks. <br>  Also he just plain looks black. Maybe a little lighter than most but his whiteness doesn't come out and hit you like it does in maybe Mariah Carey.|`|sjBLu3j2aa	I agree that blacks do not have a right to claim him (other than his half as skin color)<br>  But you know how they like to jump on the bandwagon.<br>  Obama was raised by all whites and it was the whites who got him where he was today.<br>  <br>  What did his black daddy or black ancestors do for him<br>  Not a damn thing.<br>  <br>  If he been rasied around blacks he would just have been another N****r.|`|m0yH6gokaa	Lenora... you're an idiot. I've been white for 19 years and I've never said nor have I heard anyone say that being the caucasian race is a "pure" race.

The French & "Indain" War was very important in the history of LGBT issues; we talked about it a lot in the Gay-Straight Alliance in college. The general consensus was that the British won, but I was one of the lone dissenters. I believed, and still believe, that the true winners of the French & "Indain" War were the Norwegians.

If you only have a few bags you could probably just give him/her a few dollars, but if you have a lot of heavy items (water, soda) or a lot of bags I would say $5-10 (or more if you're spending a lot of money!)|`|yfKSYPQaaa	Whatever you feel is fair, and also that wont hurt your wallet.|`|130df77840211884c0142ac3fabd5beeaa	a few dollars, nothing big. what you would give the pizza delivery man...
WcYILHzsaa	Yeah he likes you Natalie...how much idk<br>  as a friend definitely.|`|woHwYmUoaa	Why did you refer to her by her name? Lol strange. But anyway I'm going to to say it's safe to say he does. :)|`|AA10784463	If you want to find out if someone likes you, you have to start off by just having a brief, friendly chat with him and try to tell if you have anything in common. Once you find your similarities, you use these to become close friends. Then, just ask him out for coffee. If he seems happy to do so, voila!
WqMu86LUaa	I agree that French might be easier because you are already fluent in Spanish, and they are from the same language family.  I would recommend German, though, because it is fairly similar to English, and would open you up to the Germanic set of languages, if you aim at broadening your language range.  I find German easy, though, and am a German III student.|`|f0I1f6Y5aa	xD Being from Germany, I wouldn't really know how to answer that question. However, because I find Spanish and French on the same level (otherwise they wouldn't teach those languages in High School), I believe French is easier than German.<br>  <br>  But if you like a challenge, go for the German.|`|a2Xfq2vJaa	I think french and spanish have more things in common with each other. Thus, since you already know spanish it would probably be easier to learn. I can speak fluent German and for me it was very difficult to learn. Only after spending several summers in Germany was I able to speak it fluently.|`|2FVwbIe5aa	french and spanish are alike in my opinion so i would recommend french.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	According to the US military if you are a native English speaker, French would be the easiest for you to learn. It is considered a Level 1 language for native English speakers.

AA10214265	Gangster, as in Mafioso, would be a well-fitted shiny suit (a bit over the top for business attire) and a shirt/tie matching combination. I know Regis Philbin released a series of shirts awhile ago that had tie that exactly matched, perhaps you could find one of those sets. Fedora. For inspiration, watch "Some Like It Hot", "Analyze This", Analyze That" or "My Blue Heaven".<br>  <br>  Gangsta, as in street gang, baggy pants (jeans or khakis) with the wistband worn around the crotch, plaid or colored boxer briefs exposed above the pants waistband, A-frame "wifebeater" t-shirt tank top or v-neck t-shirt, oversized long sleeve shirt buttoned only at the collar, head scarf, baseball cap worn askew.|`|PuRpsENEaa	pants at ankles oversiezed t shirt<br>  sideways ball cap i guess?|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	In the ideal world it would be prison orange, but in real life the true gangsters are usually better dressed than honest hard working people.  If you're going for a stereotype, look for a fancy double breasted suit, black fedora, slicked back hair and dark glasses.|`|HQeeHKfZaa	pants around ankle, hand on crotch, walk like penguin.  also, stick foil in mouth and oversized tshirt
VNSREVTXaa	When I read the question title, Kristin Kreuk was the first person to pop into my head.

wRiVVOwnaa	You say:  <br>  <br>  "Es la una de la ma?ana"(01.00 hours) <br>  <br>  or  "Es la una de la tarde"  (13:00 hours)|`|AqgJyMn6aa	Es la una|`|AA11942287	1 o'clock = La una en punto <br>  <br>  That is the exact translation. Whether it's in the morning or in the afternoon is another story, then you would add 'de la ma?ana (or madrugada)' or 'de la tarde'.|`|f0I1f6Y5aa	1 o clock is just La Una de la tarde (afternoon), Una en el punto (one on the dot), la una de la manana (in the morning.)<br>  <br>  Just depends.

No begging or whinning. PERIOD !|`|W5G9LLenaa	research, then use presentations of slides, articles, and if you can, recordings from NA's and let them tell their stories in their own way.<br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|B6BUR6zJaa	Why do you need to stereotype and criticize a group of people who have already been beat up for so many years?<br>  <br>  That's just mean.

IxoBFCpTaa	? Jinn are a different creation that us humans. Allaah created humans, jinn, and angels.<br>  <br>  ? Jinn are a separate creatures created from smokeless fire ((Surah ar-Rahmaan))<br>  <br>  ? The Qur'aan does NOT say that humans can turn into jinn. No, a human cannot turn into any jinn. It does not say so in the Qur'aan al-Majeed.|`|4aveC2aaaa	i never heard of a human being turned into a jinn<br>  <br>  but yes, jinn do exist and they are capable of possessing<br>  <br>  @pink bubble gum: no, jinns do not possess someone if they are "bad". my grandfather was possessed a couple of months before he died simply because he slipped and fell in the bathroom and he landed on a jinn who possessed him. o_O|`|0KR4wyoQaa	I know that jinns can turn into whatever they want.|`|hceSZoAkaa	well i asked a question on jinns the other day and i was told by a few answerers that the jinns can posses a person but only if that person is like a bad person|`|0NXdjyo2aa	Humans can not be changed into Jinns because we are made differently. Jinns do exist and have lives of their own. They can possess humans and animals.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	No.Jinns may be seen as a human.But humans cannot turn into jinns.|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	I believe what you mean is 'Can Jinn take on human form?' the answer to this restructured is yes along with possession. However if you mean can a human person become a shaiytaan this is possible because a shaiytaan (devil) is more a title as one who commits murder is a murderer, one who tells lies is a liar, and one who does numerous evil things becomes a shaiytaan(devil). this applies to both man and jinn.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	The existence of "jinni" (plural of Jinn) comes from Pre-Islamic Arabian mythology that was simply accepted as a reality by Muhammad because he was a product of his own culture. There are no Jinni any more than there are "harpies," or "daimones" or keres, etc...|`|53IxrhQNaa	no never <br>  check in quran online and ALLAH never said that<br>  <a href="http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/" rel="nofollow">http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/</a><br>  <br>  dont be confused always check first!|`|Eeo6HPvuaa	If its in the Quran its true.|`|gndbaRgaaa	Just oppoisite my friend

I mean, they're both still Arab, no?|`|5HPkIxZHaa	they are both arab, so it wont make a difference.<br>  <br>  i noticed a difference, and im bengali.<br>  egyptians tend to have curly,kinky or rough hair and a tanner complextion, while<br>  palistanians have softer hair and they are tend to be lighter skinned.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	um both are majority arab countries<br>  <br>  is english and scottish a hot mix?|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Sure.

b9fXwehraa	Could it be estaré? I'll be prepared for 11?<br>  Or is the verb prepararse?<br>  Está te preparado (prepárate)...: Be ready for 11....|`|FEGtnUEcaa	"estate" is from verb ESTAR. That TE seems like a reflexive pronoun, because sometime people make "estar" into "estarse". <br>  But it is more a way to soften the harsh sound of command form ESTá.<br>  <br>  "Está" is the correct command for verb ESTAR conjugated in the informal YOU form. But it sounds very harsh, so, we add that TE, softening the sound. Also, using that TE you avoid ambiguity, because "está" can be also the conjugation for the present tense of EL (él está). So, with that TE, it can be only the command form for TU.<br>  So:<br>  correct form: Está preparado para las once....<br>  usual form: Estate preparado para....
RZetcwalaa	Here's a thought, if there is a god and he's such a prick that he lets your dad die then sends you to hell for getting upset, is he really worth all that worship. I choose hell if there is god, did you know that the bible describes how the people in heaven get to watch all of their relatives being tortured in hell?<br>  <br>  Edit @ c: Have you ever told the truth? Then you are honest, have you ever done something good? Then you are a good person... and none is good but god, so that makes you god....Your logic is self refuting, you own yourself and you are a complete fool for even attempting that conversion crap here.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	YES..if you die tonight you haven't a reasonable thing you could say in your defense.|`|TOm0lawCaa	Its not unreasonable or bad for you to expect extraordinary proof for extraordinary claims.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	You're not a bad kid at all.  Jesus is our Savior.  He gave his life for us.  He had no sin.  Moses and Noah both sinned.  If you are saved or if you've ever accepted Jesus as your savior, You're saved.  No one or nothing can take you out of the palm of God's hand...not even you.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	I think you are a smart kid with a lot of good questions. Nothing in your details point to you being a "bad kid". I hate that you feel that way just because you aren't a feeble minded sheep.|`|r3o10XbAaa	Your not a bad kid for questioning something to which there is no proof, not to mention i would definietly feel betrayed if i actually believed in god and my dad died...|`|OlLMoT5Daa	No, I think you're a normal kid. Every kid questions their family religion at some point, and you have more reason than most. I can see why you are questioning and searching, in light of you dad's death - a truly good god wouldn't take your dad from you, right?<br>  <br>  You're normal and not bad.  I would suggest you do some searching around, learn about other religions, learn more about your own, talk to a minister or pastor or priest about your feelings.  You'll find they understand, because they too have questioned their faith.<br>  <br>  And seeing some of the responses you got here, I'd be questioning Christianity if I didn't already question it.  Truly, folks, is this how jesus expected you to act?|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	The fact is God already has proved his self. There are lots here don't want to see it or believe it. I want you to look around you. Probability does not have beauty in it's equation. Something made this world beautiful at the same time something made this world self efficient. This world has the ability to heal its self when things go wrong. Mars Venus, nor Mercury cares about healing themselves. This world did not happen by mere probability. It is intentionally designed not a random event. You need to start believing in God and God doesn't care about selfish minds. I ought to know I had a selfish mind just like yours until God woke me up|`|qBOPQQQpaa	You are not a bad kid because all children born into the world are innocent clean white slates. You are sad, depressed and confused because you lost your Dad, someone you loved and could trust.As time passes,  all wounds heal and there will be other Dads in your life you will come to love. My prayers I send to you and I know that in time you will heal and believe in good things once again.

Jesus was different in that he was a spirit person in heaven before coming to earth.<br>  <br>  colossians 1:15?He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; 16?because by means of him all [other] things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, no matter whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All [other] things have been created through him and for him. 17?Also, he is before all [other] things and by means of him all [other] things were made to exist, 18?and he is the head of the body, the congregation. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that he might become the one who is first in all things; 19?because [God] saw good for all fullness to dwell in him, 20?and through him to reconcile again to himself all [other] things <br>  <br>  He was not just an inperfect human and he was a creator with his father.  so that sits him aside even from the other angels.<br>  To save mankind we needed a perfect man, which no one on earth could provide because we are all descendants of Adam.<br>  That is why he is the savior.<br>  God told Adam in the garden of eden that for dust you are and to dust you will return.

7Nxw7jWFaa	It depends on how much. I'm a generous person. I won't give someone money if it's outrageous.|`|C02lxopxaa	i say no im broke as hell|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Honestly, I've been in this situation a lot. On the West side, whenever I see my friends, I typically run into these types of people. Usually, I run into them when I'm about to get fast food. While there, they'd ask me from some money, but then, I'd tell them I don't have any. However, my uncle makes a truckload of money from doing labor such as construction, carpentry, plumbing, electricity, and you name it. I feel a need to help these people because they're usually homeless and hooked on drugs. My uncle is currently working on a building in the West side, it's going to take a while for him to finish. Plus, he always says he wishes he had more people that worked for and with him. The deal was private, meaning he's not working for the city, but rather a regular businessman that purchased the completely run down building. Therefore, because my uncle is in the area and already makes a truckload of money, I tell them to talk to him and ask for a quick job. Usually, he has them paint and clean for a great pay. Afterwards, they become regular workers for my uncle. After he needs to do another building, he knows where to find them. Sometimes I wish I could give them money, but I simply don't make enough alone. Well, that's how I help them, by giving them jobs. Then, if they wanted to fulfill drug habits, they can do so with their own money, and if they wanted to make life better for themselves, I say it's great and a lot better than being rejected by selfish people all night or accepting only 50￠, $5 tops.|`|fzih25msaa	If I'm listening to music I generally just don't make eye contact and continue walking.<br>  If I'm not, I say no, sorry and keep going.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|AA12302228	they are real,england ,espeicaly yorkshire ,has many.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	No they're not. However there are some people out there that like to act as if they're vampires. Some will go as far as having dental work done and drinking blood. But there are not real vampires|`|anfhcnWeaa	vampires that you see in movies or read in novels are not they are pure fiction.<br>  <br>  although there are real vampires out there they are human beings with a natural energy deficiency their bodies can't make enough energy by itself so to compensate for that they drink blood or consume natural energy through Psi feeding, there are two main types of vampire there is the Sanguine and the Psychic Vampires, the sanguine drink blood not much maybe a Tbl Spoon at a time a couple of times a week. (note they can not survive off of blood they still have to eat food like anyone else)  the psychic vampires feed off of natural energy( call it whatever you want Chi,Prana,Lifeforce what ever) through Psi Feeding methods.they do exist but they are nothing like the ones you see in horror movies or books and they definitely do not SPARKLE.|`|WNcoBCipaa	Vampire as in mythological creatures... no<br>  Vampires as in people who have a medical condition and need to drink blood... yes|`|h1eBWehMaa	Vampire posers are real but Vampires as depicted in the movies and books are not real|`|y3jD0DDpaa	no no NO! your gonna get dome freaks on here saying yes but plz ignore them!|`|6q2Uyb1Baa	Real vampires are very different from what most people think of when they think of vampires.  We are not supernatural beings who turn into bats and suck the blood from the living.  We do drink blood, but that may be the only similarity to fictional vampires.  We have family and friends, pets and jobs just like everyone else.  Vampires are just like everyone else, except we need to have a little bit more to live healthily.  <br>  There are two main types of real vampires.  The most well known is the sanguinarian vampire.  Sanguinarians are the vampires that feel the need to drink the blood of others.  I myself am a sanguinarian vampire.  I do drink human blood.  I do not hunt humans in the night to drain them of blood, nor do I kill rats in the sewer to consume their blood.  Sanguinarians only get their blood from WILLING donors.  I drink from my fiancé.  I myself, enjoy sucking blood, so I will use a sterile razor blade  to make a small cut on her arm or her back and I will lap up the blood.  Some vampires use other methods to get their blood.  I do not drink blood every day.  <br>  The other type of vampire is the psychic vampire.  Psychic vampires, I do not know much about, but they feed off the psychic energy that everyone gives off.  They have some way in which they draw peoples energy away from them and into their bodies.  <br>  We cannot turn someone into a vampire.  You have to be born a vampire.  No one bit me, and I have never bit anyone (aside from my fiancé, in the bedroom *wink wink*).  There is no known way to turn someone, and even if we could, it would be no different from the life a person already lives.  <br>  Vampires are not like story books and movies, however.  Vampires cannot fly (except on an airplane), we do not live forever, we do not turn into bats and fly around, we do not fry like a piece of chicken in the sunlight, we do not fear the cross or run for the wind from garlic.  We have reflections and we are in every sense, just like regular people.  We will die if we get shot, just like everyone else, we bleed, we cry, we love, we pray.  We come in every shape, color, size, and age just like everyone else.  There are ugly vampires, and pretty vampires, fat and thin vampires, black and white vampires, old and young vampires, Christian and Jewish vampires, and gay and straight vampires.  We get colds, and the flu, suffer arthritis and cancer.  We are not immune to any disease.  We have normal jobs.  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand real vampires.  There are many websites that you can find more information.  You can also email me.  I will respond as soon as I can to any questions.  <br>  www.sanguinarius.org<br>  www.slad.net<br>  www.vampirecommunity.com|`|xETCO0rUaa	I've never met one so i don't personally think so.

WQiTQGdBaa	In Spanish, reflexive verbs are pretty much the same as regular verbs. To conjugate a reflexive verb, do it the same way you normally would, just put the pronoun in front. <br>  <br>  The reflexive pronouns are:<br>  me, te, se, and nos.<br>  Use me for conjugating to the yo form, te for the tú form, se for the él,ella, usted, ellos, and ustedes forms, and nos for the nosotros form.<br>  <br>  Let's try some examples.<br>  <br>  Casarse= to get married<br>  <br>  the forms are:<br>  <br>  me caso<br>  te casas<br>  se casa<br>  nos casamos<br>  se casan<br>  <br>  Conjugating is the same in other tenses: you conjugate the verb regularly, remove the pronoun, and put it in front.<br>  <br>  For instance, let's try another in el pretérito (past tense).<br>  <br>  Ponerse= to put on (clothes)<br>  <br>  Me puse<br>  Te pusiste<br>  Se puso<br>  Nos pusimos<br>  Se pusieron<br>  <br>  *Note: poner is irregular.<br>  <br>  In the present progressive (estar + -ando/-iendo), you can put the pronoun BEFORE estar or attach it to the end of the second word.<br>  <br>  Let's try saying "I am getting dressed."<br>  <br>  ME estoy vistiendo.<br>  Estoy vistiéndome.<br>  <br>  When you attach the pronoun, you must put an accent over the third to last syllable (for ER/IR verbs, this is normally the E, and for AR verbs it is normally the A.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps  :)<br>  Feel free to ask me if you have any more Spanish questions!|`|kmIBnlBZaa	a reflexive sentence uses the pronouns<br>  <br>  me, te, se, nos, os and se (ellos) <br>  <br>  id est: <br>  <br>  I dress myself<br>  Yo me visto<br>  <br>  He looks at us<br>  <br>  él nos mira<br>  <br>  <br>  .. idk how to explain it that well actually

XoNuUrYoaa	Your question has a flaw- Catholics do not read their bibles, so by your question catholics would not be accepting the "authority" of the catholic church.<br>  <br>  I am not Protestant or Catholic, but I do believe in my bible.This does not mean I am under any churches authority.I am only to be under God's authority.<br>  <br>  In fact, the catholic church has no authority and is not the New Testament church.Catholics might like remember that they did not write the bible (as you admit), they were just the first to collect all the books together and some of those books were very dodgy.So, I do not owe the catholic church anything.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	It isn't known to me and I was raised by the Bible all my life. My Bible says that it is the inspired Word of God, given to men to write down for us, so we wouldn't forget it or get misguided by Satan again. The men that God chose were people that He trusted to spread the gospel, and the truth. Some were His disciples, others were prophets before His time on earth. Back in Jesus' day, there were Pharisees, Sadducee's, and people of the church but they weren't Catholic, but none of them were said to have compiled the Bible. His disciples were from Jewish descent, as well as Jesus. My only accepted authority is Jesus Christ and the living God of the Bible, and His Word.|`|mNZCMuSpaa	Good question..and a bit tricky.<br>  But I still say no. (I'm a baptist)<br>  <br>  The catholic church does/teaches things that others don't agree with, and that are not in the bible.<br>  For example, interacting with God through Mary. It doesn't say that we must do that in the bible.<br>  Also, not reading the bible and leaving it to the head of the church.<br>  I believe that God wants us all to make our own spiritual journeys to find Him and realize that our home is in heaven; meaning, we need to learn it for ourselves.<br>  <br>  So, while they did compile the bible, their beliefs don't necessarily jive with other christian's beliefs. So no.<br>  <br>  You should only accept the authority of one as a christian-- and that's God. :)<br>  <br>  Besides; only Catholics use the apocrypha. That's not the same as the King James bible, which I think a lot of people aren't aware of. Which makes this question a little misleading for some.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	To be fair, you should admit that the Catholic Church of the 21st or even 16th century is not exactly like that of the 4th.

It isn't. Furthermore, as far as I'm concerned personally, there are many other gospels worth giving a look at. Just because something wasn't canonized doesn't mean it has no guidance value in spirituality. Along with those uncanonized gospels, there is a multitude of other great writings. I do not accept the authority of the Catholic Church. I accept my own authority, which is exactly the kind of thing the Roman Catholic Church detested beginning centuries ago.|`|hQDapmICaa	"Even Martin Luther himself admits, "We are obliged to yield many things to the Papists (Catholics)--that they possess the Word ofGod which we received from them, otherwise we should have known nothing at all about it"<br>  <br>  <br>  Marthin Luther is NOT my SAVIOR!<br>  <br>  <br>  So if you believe in the Bible wouldn't you therefore accept the authoritative Catholic Church?<br>  <br>  This is pure nonsense! It is the Bible which condemns the un-biblical ways of the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  YES, I would submit to the Pope's authority if the Bible didn't have these verses in it:<br>  <br>  2 Thess 2:1-4<br>  <br>  Mat 15:9  But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <br>  <br>  Mat 23:12  And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted. <br>  <br>  Mat 22:21  They say unto him, Caesar's.

You are truthful in saying that catholics first compiled the Bible but they distorted it when preached false things to the people.Many Popes distorted the Bible for personal gain. The Popes also burned alive any man that attempted to rewrite the Bible in a different language than Latin (a language known only to priests and very wealthy people at the time). Martin Luther says that protestants got the Bible from the Catholics but in truth the Catholics killed many to hide the fact that they had distorted God's Holy Word into a profit making scheme. I am sorry if I offended anyone.|`|KlXDXlFvaa	That's ridiculous.<br>  Just because we accept the fact that the Catholics compiled the bible, doesn't mean we believe in the catholic traditions or their religion.<br>  You have flawed reasoning.|`|51WK9mGvaa	47 Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died; 50 this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."<br>  <br>  52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 53 Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear. Jesus’ body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in “remembrance” as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‘ Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works. We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>  Now is your chance to come home to Jesus’ one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way. We should not have divided. Your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church. We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is “the Holy One of God” and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.|`|9wJaUSNWaa	Your reasoning that the Bible was compiled by Catholics, therefore, Catholicism is the authority - is far reaching. <br>  <br>  God's faith existed prior to the Catholic Church.  The body of the Church's existence is further along in history.  The collection of works of Biblical origin were studied by many.  As with the Protestant, a selected few theologians from different regions were assembled to select the official Bible. The same is true, with varying form, with all the religious bodies and denominations.<br>  <br>  This part is man made.  The body of a religious protocol for fulfillment of Faith? It is declared in the writings of Paul that it doesn't matter that a person was circumcised or that the rituals of sacrifice were made.  Pointing to the fact that rituals did not make you righteous or faithful.  The Church itself does not make you faithful.<br>  <br>  The Bible mentions God as the One and Superior.  Further, that no man/church shall be superior to.  The writings of Paul, in particular point out the difficulties of maintaining truth and integrity in Gods word/faith among church and of man.  Constant reference to political, social, elitist, and even legal strife to faith within the church structure were urged by Paul for reconsideration.  The church is a means to faith; but, when structures of a church body (of any denomination) bend and sway with the climate of the times - as in Paul's Letters - God's faith is lost or short-circuited among men.<br>  <br>  Is it not mentioned in St Bridgett, of the man asking the questions of the Lord's angel, that he was not asking out of faith?  Do you gain more faith from the word of God or Catholicism? <br>  <br>  I find all the evidence of God's word to be fascinating and enlightening.  It is a shame that periods of history are missing due to the "climate of the times".|`|E0CZ69FYaa	No, the Bible was written by people inspired by God. The church just compiled it. By the way remember the Catholic Bible has extra books at the end of it Protestants don't have such as the books of Tobit and Ecclesiasticus and the Book of Jubilee is sometimes added. Protestants don't use these books because they were written a while after the death of Jesus unlike Matthew- Revalation in the NT. There are many checks that the Protestant Bible went through. The Catholics added those extra books later. If you want more info on this subject I would strongly suggest reading "Evidence that Demands a Verdict". It is a good book.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The Bible was complete in 90 AD, and handed around to all the churches.  The catholic cult didn't exist at that time. <br>  <br>  And I don't go by Luther.  I go by Jesus and the Bible<br>  <br>  It's obvious from the Book of Acts in the Bible that catholics didn't even exist during the days of Acts. Those in the Book of Acts are the first Christians, and they believed what would be called fundamentalist doctrine today. Anyone can read the Book of Acts for themselves and see. Had catholicism existed during the time of Acts, the first Christians would have rejected catholicism completely.<br>  <br>  Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9).

He would think nothing of giving his own life if it meant helping his emperor or country. <br>  <br>  This warrior was used to battle and he had killed many men and so he was beginning to wonder if there was a heaven and a hell and if so how could he get to heaven and stay clear of hell. <br>  <br>  He was concerned that he may not be allowed into heaven due to the fact that he had killed so many men this lifetime. <br>  <br>  He had heard of the famous Zen master Hakuin and was told he could show him how to get to heaven. He decided to go and meet him and traveled long and far to find him. <br>  <br>  After many days of gruesome travel over mountains and rough terrain he finally found the master. The warrior was doubtful when he met master Hakuin, he looked just like a simple peasant and the warrior really wondered if this simple man could authentically answer his question. <br>  <br>  After all this travel it would be pointless to go back without asking the question and so the strong warrior asked Hakuin if indeed there was a heaven and a hell, and if so how could he get to heaven and avoid hell? <br>  <br>  Master Hakuin being a very wise man, answered the question in a way the warrior would never forget. <br>  <br>  Master Hakuin replied, "who are you?" to which the warrior replied, I am the chief samurai warrior of Japan and I work directly with the emperor, I am the leader of all samurai in Japan. <br>  <br>  Hakuin laughed and said, you a warrior, you are nothing but talk, you could not save your self never mind our emperor, don't waste my time, go! <br>  <br>  At this the warrior was deeply offended and was immediately angry, he drew his sword ready to kill this peasant man in front of him, but just before he made the strike, Hakuin shouted, "Stop!" and continued, "this is hell." The warrior stopped and put his sword back in its sheath and Hakuin smiled as he said "and this is heaven."|`|bzsnAC7Iaa	After we die we will be in heaven awaiting judgement. satan is then loosed at the end of the Millenium to tempt us one last time.

The church would in a sense allow mercy killing, they would allow only a few drops of water be given to the children and small amounts of food until their death..daily..and no extraordinary means to save their lives.<br>  It's hard to understand this and the church's stand on abortion, but this is how it is.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you made mention that the church and Priest's are NOT the only ones guilty of molesting children.|`|Au1BVCvAaa	abortion is murder in ALL CIRCUMSTANCES-----and there are no excuses for murder-----<br>  as horrible and disgusting as the crime of rape may be-----rape is still not murder----<br>  <br>  *headdesk*<br>  *headdesk*<br>  *headdesk*<br>  <br>  dammit! now there's blood everywhere. thanks losasha|`|B4YlBDzhaa	My Position:<br>  <br>  Pro-Life for the sake of unnecessary-birth-control; that could be had by other means [thru education, contraceptives, etc..]<br>  <br>  Pro-Choice when the mother's life is on the line.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	I agree with that archbishop all the way.  Abortion is murder, regardless of the circumstances.  God has a plan for everyone on this Earth.  God was clearly testing the faith of that family (read the book of Job, it covers the topic of human trials).  If God did not want that girl to give birth, then he would have made her miscarry.  Even if she did die, it would be nothing to mourn.  She would have died in the name of God (as countless Saints have done in the past).  Salvation is far more important than earthly splendors.<br>  <br>  Using your line of thinking, would you say that it is appropriate to rob a bank if you loose your job?  If it ok for someone a person (in need of an organ transplant) to kill his enemy, harvest his body for organs, and have them transplanted into himself?  Christianity is all about following God.  It is not acceptable for a Christian to put his/her own well being ahead of his/her salvation.<br>  <br>  Where would I draw the line?<br>  <br>  I would have sent the doctors and that mother to a firing squad.  That would serve as an excellent example to would-be sinners.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Well, there are obvious double standards and human rights abuses throughout this story. Yes, some awful things happened to this girl and her family. But the lives of these babies still have value. I doubt that she really would've died just from being 9 years old and pregnant.

You can't see the future. And as far as her size - have you seen Amy Roloff's body? A normal 9-year old is much bigger than her, and yet she's had how many children? How did a 3-ft tall woman carry 4 normal-sized children to term, two of them twins? I think you underestimate the capacity of the human body. <br>  They should have simply left the pregnancy in God's hands - not theirs. More than likely, even if the babies were delivered prematurely, all 3 of them would have had a better chance to live.|`|7G0IyCltaa	Very well-put.<br>  <br>  Of course rape and child molestation aren't offenses requiring excommunication, because, as you put it these are cases of sexism.

I might just say, if you ever want to try my faith, its always here for you.<br>  <br>  There are organizations like "Jews For Jesus" that seem to seek other Jews to make them into Christians.  Not sure what I think of that.|`|H8KQh4Jkaa	Yes because they are people too, and need to be converted/witnessed just as much as everyone else. So yeah it's perfectly fine for them too. I'm Christian and I just try to witness to anyone I see walking down the street. Doesn't matter who. =) God doesn't care if they're already religious.|`|G2yUpoqfaa	It is the command of Christ to convert them.  Go and preach.

Nosotros también hicimos nuestras propias películas, como Titánico(or you can say Titanic since it's an english movie title), con nuestros amigos. Nosotros nunca tuvimos un momento aburrido juntos en esa casa. Después de que mi mamá, mi hermano y yo movieran, estuve muy triste, pero yo sólo viví 10 minutos lejos de nuestra casa anterior.

AA12006309	Has it occurred to you that inflicting violence on someone under those circumstances qualifies as assault, and a hate crime?<br>  <br>  Yes, despite anything you might say, your actions are homophobic, and actions speak far louder than words.  Get over yourself.  Just because someone stares at you doesn't mean they're undressing you with their eyes, and it's certainly not an invitation for you to hit them in some Neanderthal like expression of your hetero-masculine nature.<br>  <br>  The Gays aren't out to get you or recruit you, and just like you aren't attracted to the first set of T&A to wander into your field of vision, not every gay man is wanting to get their hands on you.  They do have standards.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	I agree with everyone here. No, I don't see you as homophobic but I do find that you have violent tendencies. I understand that you're not gay which of course is fine but is it possible that you could take it as a compliment that someone finds you attractive. Then leave it at that. You obviously can say, "I'm not interested." or I'm not into that. But to resort to physical harm because someone looked at you is just not cool. I don't think you'd want to do prison time just because someone pissed you off instead of just walking away. And yes in today's world you can serve time for assault- especially on gays as a hate crime.|`|Mpl6auhBaa	Let me put it to you this way:<br>  <br>  As a lesbian, many people automatically assume that I'm a man-hater. Let's say that I have some male friends who I'm okay spending time with. Would you call me a man-hater if I caught a man staring at my butt and broke his arm, when if I caught a girl staring at my butt I would smile and start a conversation?|`|4azCh1aeaa	well you might be !in my ow words homophobic is when you hate gays and call them names like ****** or gay guy. i think thats a little mean to do.|`|Ch0FmmyNaa	I think that people think you are homophobic because you punch people whenever you are confronted with people "acting" gay around you. <br>  Try not hitting people as much :) Or at all!|`|yDT9k44caa	dosnt make you homophobe just makes you a violent person.... just tell them that you dont roll that way... theyll respect you for it.... hopefully lol|`|PzxUeGDCaa	not homophobic just violent|`|70At0HClaa	errh well yes you are violent get help you homophope|`|qTRzRi8gaa	Dislocating someone's shoulder is a bit of an extreme reaction.  Dislocated shoulders aren't very fun, I'm lead to believe.<br>  <br>  Take it as a compliment.  Gay guys, like straight guys, are generally more visually stimulated than women.  If a gay guy is hitting on you, it means you're hot.<br>  <br>  Just tell them you're straight, and not comfortable with that sort of attention.  If they don't get the hint, stop hanging out with them.  If they act like obnoxious jerks, maybe insult them saying they lack class or something.  Violence should be the last resort in like any sort of social exchange.  It's a part of living in a civilized society.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	You just sound like your garden variety bully.

Carmen didn't comeback unless, of course, you consider appearing for 5 seconds on a TAPE is coming back. Most of the characters ended up alone. And Season 6 seemed more like a bad parody of TLW rather than a follow-up, I mean what was Ilene thinking? She must have had almost an overdose to write such a bad story! Also, where was the comedy and the humor that was a part of the show in every first 5 seasons?<br>  <br>  Am I the only one who thinks like this?|`|rCzKCCDJaa	Jenny was my faavorite character at the begging !<br>  <br>  now its nikki :]|`|hyYWX82Eaa	I did come to hate her recently and had my "ZOMG someone NEEDS to KILL Jenny!1!" moments--but this made me so sad, I mean, even if she was going through a crazy-spell she was amazing and she's just...dead. <br>  <br>  Guh.

n8EcCVfWaa	Not necessarily. <br>  <br>  I was wondering that same thing. <br>  Here is what i learned:<br>  <br>  Like you said, God created us so we could develop and grow to become better and better. No matter what, things change over time. God made rocks able to erode, trees to decay, animals to change to adapt to their environment, so why not us? But the thing i want to stress is that we were not apes! Its says in the bible that we are created in God's own image, and he is no monkey. God made apes, God made man (and woman). The two are not linked. But I think we have definately changed over time. <br>  <br>  Religon is hard to debate. There are lots of loose ends so sometimes<br>  you just have to settle with what your gut tells you. <br>  As long as you believe in God and know he died for our sins, then you won't be going to hell. :)|`|UdatjYEQaa	depends if you have a relationship with God or not..<br>  you have to believe in god to be entered into heaven,<br>  <br>  NO ONE can tell you if your going to hell or not,<br>  it all depends when you die, and what type of person you are.|`|7mxCMfYKaa	No I don't not believe so. As long as you believe the Bible and in Christ you should be fine. But If you want to do the research you can come to your own conclusion of if it actually meshes with the Bible.|`|AA11718880	That's stupid, everybody knows that evolution mixed with the need to feel special is what created god.|`|xw55lwscaa	The Lord will be the only judge of that and any burning will be done by your own transgressions beyond limits.|`|VgfUAleGaa	Of course! God is actually looking for reasons to throw you into hell!|`|B6ioLtejaa	Maybe.|`|gsrZM0h8aa	Of course not! Well, no one really knows what happens on the other side, but you have your own right to believe what you want to believe!|`|7d83163208b99a41da654b4bebe0fd8faa	no you wont i mean come on is that you're biggest concern you may burn in hell but not for that reason good luck lol|`|nIIbDKhEaa	No, because there is no hell, and god doesn't exist.|`|zQnF051Uaa	No. Because he did.|`|kuFAx4ymaa	There is no Hell.  Its in your mind.|`|1qmRNRT0aa	no, there is no hell|`|2mcBULoNaa	no|`|E71jweytaa	well seeing as the vast majority of christians and even the vatican seem to agree with the theory id venture to say its a safe bet you wont|`|3RkK1Mcqaa	I don't know, but why believe in a God who lied to you?

But God may be indignant of the fact that you can't spell properly.|`|247e16fe699fb80e444deaffc4762c81aa	no as long as your faith is in Christ|`|3c0c8be5fca466eb221bf1bf02ddc784aa	No, but he will be disappointed that you don't believe the truth. Evolution is just a theory that people use to avoid believing in God. As far as I can tell, no one has ever predicted any of the important discoveries in science e.g. DNA, using it. Also, my observation is it doesn't fit the available evidence of what we know about life and biology. <br>  So, apart from the those facts, there isn't any reason to dismiss Evolution, mind you, a theory which doesn't fit the evidence and can't be used to make predictions isn't much use .... unless it also discounts the need for God.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Well "evolution" is a lie, and it never happened. <br>  <br>  The Bible makes it clear that "evolution" is false and never happened.  Jesus makes that clear. <br>  <br>  But if you still insist on believing the "evolution" lie, well that's your decision. <br>  <br>  The only way to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing in Jesus alone for salvation.  When you believe, then you will never be sent to hell, no matter what  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|6Nuaqihpaa	No. I think Heaven and Hell are places that might exist. It my view, what we call Heaven is a place where the "good" go, and Hell is where the "bad" go.<br>  Believing in evolution doesn't make you a bad person.|`|WCo25oFmaa	naw, hell isn't real. It was made up by twisted men to control the masses.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I agree that we all need to evolve and learn more about life.|`|bKwCs8zhaa	'created evolution' - oxymoron.|`|TeXaZaW3aa	lol|`|wacKJOcBaa	no|`|oSFcmUoLaa	religion is a pile of donkey balls :)

AA11632370	Q: What is mutiny? A: Mutiny: open revolt, esp. by soldiers or sailors against their officers.<br>  <br>  It is true that YouTube and eSnips have been blocked "in the national interest of Bangladesh" by the newly elected prime minister, Sheikh Hasina when she addressed the top military officers (in the aftermath of BDR massacre at Pilkhana) in Dhaka Cantonment and the heated discussions were secretly circulated using YouTube and eSnips.<br>  <br>  Official defends YouTube block. Sun, Mar 8th, 2009 10:32 pm BdST. Quote: ...."An audio on the proceedings of the March 1 meeting between Prime Minister (PM) Sheikh Hasina and hundreds of army officers at the Dhaka cantonment in the wake of the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny was posted on both the sites, and visitors passed on the links through emails".... <br>  <br>  Investigators have so far found involvement of around 450 Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) personnel in the mutiny at the BDR HQs while at least 12 of them led several groups of mutineers during the 33-hours long bloody mutiny. It is now known that the rebels killed 90% of the army-officers within 11:00 AM (2-hours) of 25th February and then exacted a promise and 'order' from the PM for the General Amnesty, which has been modified later by the PM's office when the true picture of gruesome killing surfaced.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	A mutiny is a rebellion, usually when the crew of a ship rebel against the captain.|`|4oQyDdvdaa	hi priya....<br>  @priya- nope i juss wanted two points and i had nothing else to say<br>  =P|`|MirV9kSsaa	isn't this a place?|`|E70jju0baa	OH SO THATS WHY I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ENTER YOUTUBE!!!<br>  <br>  Damn those who blocked it!!!<br>  <br>  Yeah the mutiny originated like 4-5 miles from where we are staying but we didnt hear the shots, although we say people running madly in the streets, I also saw tanks and armoured vehicles and trucks full of Army men moving around the city.

AA12203324	First off, "aka" means "also known as" and refers to alternate names, not explanations.  The term you probably want is "i.e.".<br>  <br>  Jacob's story starts with his birth in Genesis 25 and ends with his death in Genesis 49.  As a child and a young man, he spent most of his time (with the help of his mother) tricking his older, dumber brother out of his inheritance and his father's blessing.  He was in turn tricked into marrying the older of two sisters by his uncle, but he worked a second seven-year contract to marry the younger, then used folk magic to make off with most of his uncle's sheep herd.  So the "moral lesson" seems to be, "get it while you can."<br>  <br>  There was a critical incident on his way to settling down in Genesis 35:10, when he finds himself wrestling with an "angel".  For his effort, God renames him "Israel" ("struggler with God"), implying the kind of relationship he and his descendants would have with the Almighty.  From then on, the story concentrates largely on the adventures and fortunes of his four wives, twelve sons and one daughter, who become the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.|`|kWz0nEdBaa	Jacob wanted the birthright of his brother Esau so badly that he deceived him in order to receive the blessing of his father Isaac. His deed has resulted in his being cheated many times later on and he feared Esau when he returned home with Rachel and Leah. There was also a time when he wrestled with God (of course, in the form of a man) and he won. He said to him "I won't let you go unless you bless me." And he was blessed and was called Israel from then on.|`|wu0LS4rlaa	Jacob was the second twin born, bought the birthright from Esau then tricked his father into giving him the firstborns blessing. Fled to avoid being killed by Esau, worked 7 years for Rachel but was tricked and given Leah as wife, worked another seven years for his uncle to get Rachel. Went back home, most of it was travel until the story of Joseph starts.<br>  <br>  Genesis 25:19- 35:29|`|3RkK1Mcqaa	Genesis 25:19-54<br>  Genesis 27-Genesis 35. check out biblegateway.com if you ever want to know where something is.

We just say United States, more often then not, because unity is one of the many things that make our country stand out from others.<br>  <br>  But, anyway, our country is called AMERICA. We are made of UNITED STATES.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Who DID say that you were American, I didn't!<br>  Also, YOU are the idiot because you claim that you hate Americans, when you haven't even met all of us.

81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	The Original Disciples of Yeshua/Jesus NEVER called themselves Christians. The Followers in Yeshua in Jerusalem called themselves Ebionites-Nazirenes, and such. But never Christian. The reason why was because the name "Christian" was used MANY centuries before Yeshua's existence on this earth. The name "Christian" was a title given to initiates of a mystery religion that was based on the Christos. I'll even quote this for proof, This quote below is from Emperor Adrian to Servianus, written in 134 A.D,<br>  <br>  "Egypt, which you commended to me, my dearest Servianus, I have found to be wholly fickle and inconsistent, and continually wafted about by every breath of fame. The worshipers of Serapis are called Christians, and those who are devoted to the god Serapis, call themselves Bishops of Christ".<br>  <br>  See what many modern day Christians don't understand, which was clearly known by the ancient followers in Jerusalem that the name "Christian" was pagan in its origin and people called themselves Christian before Jesus. However this does not diminish what "Christian" means if one is calling themselves a Christian. It means "to-be-Christ-like" and because this is the definition, None of the so-called Christians is really one, as many are not even trying to fulfill what the name means within themselves, in fact they say everything in order to not fulfill the requirements TO BE CHRIST LIKE! They have not earned the title. In the past for people to be called Christian they had to be initiated through practice and reaching a certain point in progression. <br>  <br>  Anyways, as a added thought, Yeshua/Jesus never established Christianity, that name they adopted years and years after he died. It was simply called "TheWay".|`|eAMq1iBWaa	"ian" is a noun ending meaning "one who" and of course you have heard of Christ<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	Dictionary dot com  says, <br>  Origin: 1250–1300; < L Chrīstiānus < Gk Chrīstiānós, equiv. to Chrīst(ós) Christ + -iānos <br>  <br>  Acts 11:26 is where the Bible indicates that by Divine providence the disciples were first called Christians.<br>  <br>  "22The account about them got to the ears of the congregation that was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Bar′na·bas as far as Antioch. 23?When he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all to continue in the Lord with hearty purpose; 24?for he was a good man and full of holy spirit and of faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord. 25?So he went off to Tarsus to make a thorough search for Saul 26?and, after he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It thus came about that for a whole year they gathered together with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians" (Acts 11:22-26)|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	That is a brilliant question... because Christ never asked that a religion be named after him... in fact, it appears to me that he had no intention of establishing any religion, especially the kind we see these days!<br>  <br>  This will explain what I am talking about: <a href="http://gospelenigma.com" rel="nofollow">http://gospelenigma.com</a><br>  <br>  So I would say that the word Christian came from those who wanted to ignore the Kingdom Gospel he preached about a "kingdom hid in a field" and start their own gospel fashioned after the teachings of Paul/Saul.|`|247e16fe699fb80e444deaffc4762c81aa	from "Christ"|`|r6JskEtxaa	Christ?|`|sebhK7r7aa	Jesus Christ|`|82AAOxCfaa	it used to be a name to mock and ridicule those who followed Christ. then it turned into something positive. christian means to be like Christ...to follow Christ or to be "Christ-like".|`|qp5EFetJaa	Seriously...?|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Christ - Christian|`|jOmcqOFCaa	god duh|`|euo0j3NTaa	It comes from the mouth of Jesus Christ.|`|MMImKRAgaa	one who believes in Christ
RMsHTePVaa	When I was a kid age 8 I used to steal and I stole just to see if I could get away with it. Mom is a pyschatrist so it wasn't like I stole because I couldn't afford it. I stole a pack of markers and would have got away with it because they thought it was a lady who walked out before me when the siren went off. Also stole food at the grocery store, coat, and candy..lol I knew they couldn't do anything to me because I was a minor but they did try to scare me once buy putting me in a police car. I don't regret it because I got it out of my system and I learned from it.

f8CN2qIvaa	The jury is still out on ancient astronauts, but I do believe in aliens.

There is no structure on this earth that could not have been built by human hands.  That said, I do believe in the existence of aliens, and I suppose it's possible they helped us out a bit.  It's true there are some weird bits of technology bouncing around the past (Baghdad Batteries, the Antikythera Mechanism, etc), but none of that is definite proof, or even highly suggestive of anything other than the fact that humans liked to make useless items 4000 years ago just like they do today.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	I don't believe they've come to Earth, but I believe there is a high probability of relatively highly intelligent beings out there.|`|AA12045802	You betcha.|`|8qctM0B4aa	i do|`|APjnSYKuaa	John Glenn is getting pretty old.

Not knowing exactly how they were built doesn't mean people from outer space did it.  What purpose would space aliens have in building tombs for Pharaohs or South American kings?   <br>  <br>  Programs that are out to sensationalize things don't present objective data, but they are like magicians who conceal things with a slight of hand.  As far as the Egyptian pyramids, researchers know what quarry the blocks of stone came from, which is near the Nile river.  It's believed they transported the blocks on barges down the Nile river.  There is also evidence that a canal was dug from the Nile to the pyramids.  That would not be aliens transporting them on barges.  If the Egyptians could build them, why not the Peruvians?<br>  <br>  With slaves and the correct leverage I think people built the pyramids.  Claims of alien help has no corroborating evidence other than people claiming those people had no way to do it.  <br>  <br>  Now, I do believe aliens have visited this planet.  As a kid I saw a flying saucer up close, but I don't believe they built any pyramids.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Nope.  There's no evidence of that.<br>  <br>  It's not logical to say that humans couldn't have built pyramids in Peru.  They built them in Egypt, after all.  <br>  <br>  Still, as absurd as the idea of aliens coming to earth to teach mankind really is, sensible, logical, sane, rational atheist Richard Dawkins believes that they must have designed life as we know it and planted it here.  <br>  <br>  This is apparently more likely than the chance evolution of life.<br>  <br>  Don't believe he said this?

But we are told that there will be great distress when they see others going into the kingdom and themselves being shut out.<br>  <br>  We all make our choices and when we die our opportunity to change towards God is also gone, forever.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Jhn 11:35 Jesus wept.

WKkyriIZaa	Oh thats a perfect number! For my birthdays, i invite about 10-15 people, and we all meet up at Pat & Oscars, where we eat lunch/dinner... whatever the time is... After the food, which takes about one hour, we go to watch a movie at the theaters, which, is good for us, because the restaurant is right next to it. But anyways, when you (if you) see a movie, make sure she chooses one that isnt all horror(ish) like, you know, like my bloody valentine... o-o well, not unless EVERYONE invited wants to see it.. <br>  <br>  The usual (total) cost is about: <br>  15 people x $7 movie tickets + about $50 for food = about $140, which is a pretty cheap price, but the party is still fun! <br>  <br>  Happy Birthday to your sister, Hope its a good one!|`|ls7tcUpiaa	I find that the more fun and less stressful birthday is always one with just close friends, and a sleepover...but iceskating is a blast with alot of people..and don't go bowling, because it is hit or miss with a lot of people..this may sound babyish..but i went to the coolest fourteenth birthday ever where you slleept over at the musame everyone scared eachother and had a really good time.|`|hLa7CqRjaa	Is your sister into that twilight fad by any chance?<br>  <br>  I know alot of females around that age usually like that kind of stuff.<br>  <br>  If not, ask her what she likes.

AA10889969	Don't believe for a minute that images or concepts in a dream have a fixed meanings for everyone. It's dependent on the dreamer himself/herself. That is to say, concepts in dreams represent feelings *you* have. To interpret the concept, you must ask *yourself* what feelings those concepts evoke in you, and then figure out what, in real life, gives you that *same feeling*. Then you'll know THAT'S what the concept represents.<br>  <br>  In your example, you dream about being a hobo, a vampire and having the police called on you by your grandmother. What feeling does that series of events evoke in you? Fear? Trepidation? Excitement? Confusion?<br>  <br>  Is there anything in your current life that is causing you that same exact feeling? Are you worried about how your family perceives you? Are you in some sort of transition (between jobs, between homes) and anxious about what the future may hold?  Are you uncomfortable with a current series of events? Whatever is going on in your life right now that is causing you that same emotional turmoil or ambivalence or excitement or feeling is what the concepts in the dream represent.<br>  <br>  The answer to what the images in your dream represent lies in those questions, and only you know the answers to those questions.  Answer those questions for yourself and, bingo, you'll have the answer to what the imagery in your dream represents.|`|WNcoBCipaa	go to... www.dreammoods.com<br>  <br>  I have it bookmarked for those REALLY weird dreams.|`|UplpiqdCaa	lol :D<br>  nice!|`|EKPo2y19aa	Hm..well..people have many strange and unclear dreams...it probably is just a bunch of random pictures that are stored in your brain making a image in your dreams.

Marriage is the committed love or two persons capable of natural procreation. <br>  <br>  I'm Catholic. The Catholic Church teaches that sex must be unitive (uniting a husband and wife) and procreative (be open to the possibility of life). If you take away either aspect you pervert the sex act and the marriage commitment. <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church teaches that birth control is wrong because it sterilizes the sex act and renders it non-procreative. In the same way loveless sex is wrong because it ceases to be a giving act, and becomes a selfish one. They go together.<br>  <br>  Homosexuals may love each other, no one doubts that aspect, but their union can never be naturally procreative. Their sexual act cannot result in life. This makes the act disordered, going against the natural order and design of God. <br>  <br>  Because of birth control, the secular world has come to view marriage as primarily being about love where children are a choice. In the natural and ordered view of the Church, love and children are all equally important aspects of a life long commitment, called marriage, that two people make to each other.|`|llDXCv4raa	"You may say that homosexuality destroys society, but I think those who are intolerant destroy society."<br>  <br>  I agree<br>  <br>  "Diversity makes life beautiful, don't you think?"<br>  <br>  I agree with that too<br>  <br>  I've been married for 7 years this summer, and honestly the fact that my husband is a man isn't that important to me.

God is not like that at all. <br>  If I were you, I would just respect their wishes and just go on and date her anyway. If you aren't doing anything wrong. Who gave them right to control you. Just go with the flow and move on with your life. One day you will be on your own and than what? <br>  If this is the woman you believe God has put in your life. Date her. The bible says, he who finds a wife finds a good thing. The bible also says that a man shall leave his mother and father and shall cling to his wife.

That's very unjust because you seem extremely responsible to me.<br>  <br>  You understand that kissing someone you like does not lead immediately to sex.  THEY don't think you can control yourself. By their behavior, you have made the only decision available to you ... leaving them out of important areas of your life.  You've made the logical decision that what they don't know won't hurt them.<br>  <br>  Just stay as smart as you are and meet your friend when you can.

ZYOJQdjyaa	Yes, they are being trained in childhood to feel shame. The society we live in has so many sexual hang-ups it isn't funny, but at least here in Canada the Naked Bike Ride protest is certainly very naked, especially Vancouver's. People who try to break the status quo are frowned upon by the repressed majority. <br>  <br>  The media sensationalizing sex doesn't help - the bodily images people are bombarded with create artificial sensations of unworthiness in the masses, causing people who do not fit the popular stereotype afraid if showing themselves in a state of undress. It took me a long time to break my programming - luckily I had not taken to it very well to begin with - and now have spent a few hippie music fests in a state of unhindered nudity: no-one there made me feel shame or assumed I was looking for 'a good time.' I found more people looked me in the eye, actually, instead of allowing themselves to drift with imagining what I had under my clothes (that's the theory, anyways).<br>  <br>  People have been trained to believe that the only time to get naked is when we intend to procreate - or at least go through the motions. The Biblical laws and attitudes against nudity have less to do with shame and more to do with the times in which the laws and ideas were formed. It's generally agreed that people are more 'civilized' now than we were then: for as long as people are trained to see naked people as objects we will not be worthy calling ourselves a mature society.<br>  <br>  Think on this: in Denmark, 2% of the nation's beaches are NOT clothing-optional.|`|7ZqSiZqUaa	judao-christian tradions make us ashamed of our bodies - cos nudity=sex and sex=sin.<br>  <br>  by controlling our sexuality our minds are also controlled - in fact, I think [wityout any evidence to back it up!] that the more uptight people's clothing was, the more uptight their midns were.  just take a look at the victorians!<br>  <br>  if everyone was habitually nude, then [after we'd got used to it!] we'd take no notice of it - skin is skin.  whereas, in fact, because nudity is rarely encountered, it's "naughy" and makes us think of "sinning"<br>  <br>  try a natrust resort - I plan to as soon as the weather warms up a bit!|`|1LZdc4K5aa	I totally agree, although I think it may be an evolutionary adaptation.

I do not think that constantly shouting " you are going to burn in hell" will do anything.  And conversion to Christianity should be anything but threatening.<br>  <br>  The thing is that there is the physical aspect of the afterlife (if that makes any sense) but there is so much more to Christianity than yelling at people to repent (though it is necessary)<br>  <br>  Wouldn't you think that, as Christians, we should be kind and spreading the love of Jesus rather than shouting?  The interesting thing is that most people like Jesus but not the Church.<br>  <br>  God loves everyone, even those who do not believe in him.  It is this love which Jesus demonstrates: "agape" the sacrificial love.  This is what we want everyone to realize.  Because life takes on a whole new meaning.  Faith is believing without seeing.  <br>  <br>  The unfortunate thing is that there is an end to life as we know it, on this Earth, and it depends on belief, and only belief, where one will spend eternity.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully the people who you are talking to will try to demonstrate more of the love, caring, and compassion in the Christian faith - but there is the reality of the afterlife.|`|kZT828wJaa	They may think, mistakenly, that you are a devil worshiper, but I'm an Atheist, which they think is another notch down on their totem pole :P<br>  <br>  The reason many Christians tout hell fire at you, is because they are shocked and astounded that other people weren't indoctrinated into their faith system, and until you accept Jesus, you are a diseased sub-human in their minds, so they will threaten you, lie, or do whatever it takes to get you to succumb.<br>  <br>  On the up side, they don't burn you as witches anymore, and Atheists don't have to risk execution and ridicule and being dragged along by law to their god awful sermons... not even slightly interesting ones.<br>  <br>  :P|`|mjGSAGHyaa	Fear tactics is the only way they can get new members.<br>  <br>  Reminds me of the pro-life movement.

Wiccans and Pagans Are Not Satanists Ask any Pagan or Wiccan about the cornerstone of their faith, and they'll probably tell you it's a reverence for their ancestors, a belief in the sacredness of nature, a willingness to embrace the Divine within ourselves, or an acceptance of polarity between the male and female.<br>  <br>   It will not have anything to do with the Satan, Old Scratch, Beelzebub, or any of the other names attributed to the Christian devil.

What you choose to think about the subject has no effect on that issue at all. Millions of people who honestly believed that  "Hitler doesn't really mean it about killing the Jews/taking over the world/invading Russia/ etc." <br>  <br>  So simply airily saying " I don' t believe in Hell" doesn't effect the issue one whit.

Christianity is supposed to be TRUE, and Truth, by it's very nature is a VERY intolerant thing. (As John Adams said "facts are stubborn things". )<br>  <br>  Lets say you ask me what's for dinner, and I hand you a rock. When you object I tell you  it is actually a Whopper, fries, and a coke. No matter how "open minded" and "tollerant" you are, that rock isn't going to get any more edible. The TRUTH is that it is a rock. That TRUTH rules out it being a Whopper combo meal, and it also rules out it being a baskeball, a tulip, a whale, or a copy of the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Truth is, by it's very nature very intollerant.  To parphrase Ayn Rand "You can not compromise between truth and falsehood any more than you can compromise between food and poison."<br>  <br>  Christians are called to be charitable, patient, and loving... they are not called upon to be dishonest and pretend that truth and falsehood are the same thing.|`|UujliMsCaa	"No one ever threatened me to do something that was wonderful to do. My parents didn’t threaten me with punishment to get me to go to Disneyland. But to make me go to the dentist or work on the vineyard, that was another matter.<br>  So if I am told that I must love God or he will throw me into hell, I might well consider loving him—or at least pretend I do. But if the only reason I’m even responding to him is to serve my own self-interest and escape a fiery eternity in hell, am I really loving him or myself?<br>  Can a true friendship blossom under so grave a threat? Let’s say I approach a recent acquaintance of mine, hoping to deepen our friendship. I say to him, “I have really appreciated the time we’ve been able to spend together. In fact, I’d like to see our relationship deepen and maybe even become best friends. How would you like to spend some time together over the next few months and see if that kind of friendship develops?”<br>  So far, so good! But what if I added one more sentence? “I hope you do, because if you don’t, I’m going to hunt you down and torture you for the rest of your life.” Hasn’t the invitation just taken an ominous turn? Even if he wanted to explore the potential of a friendship with me, it has now been twisted by my threat. What does it say about me, and how will he ever feel safe in a friendship cultivated on fear?<br>  Whether you are conscious of it or not, the threat of hell can create an inner dissonance in our perception of the God who seeks our love. How can we feel safe with a God who is seemingly anxious to dangle us over the flames of hell? If he can find nothing else to call us to come to him, then what kind of God must he be? And if we can find no better reason to love him, how shallow must our faith be?"|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	Brian S: There is a good reason that patronizers of child porn go to jail. And we know it happens. If I go to hell, it won't have been for a good reason. "God" will have judged me for coming to a logical an understandable decision, and will have disregarded my character. That is not a good reason to be punished. And no one knows if its happens. No, not you either. <br>  <br>  Once again, an irrelevant analogy.|`|LZJPMl8raa	If your house was burning while you were sleeping, would you want someone to wake you up, and take you out of the house or at least call the fire department and put out the fire??<br>  <br>  Or would you rather the person "be as kind and us leave you be"??|`|6jAVElX7aa	Christianity is far from tolerant. we are suppose to turn the other cheek,when reviled and not revile in return.

With the money with college I am in a similar situation, My parents are not rich people, I basically come from Debt then Money. Get a student loan, You can pay for college that way. I am getting my Associates in Nursing so I can save up that money Pay my loan & save up for a few years to get my BS or BA. You can try something similar to that, to pay for your education.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Don't take this the wron way, But Damn if you have e verything given to you a House, Car Education, You will never live. You need to be out on your own & work your rear off & in the end when you get a house by working & pay with your own money, You will appreciate it more. My Sister in law, her father offered to buy her a house she has a openended bank acct for her schooling, & he wants to buy her a new car & pay for everything, But she is working a minnimum wage job, Driving a POS & taking out student loans to pay for her education wheile living in her own in the ghetto, She appreciates everything alot more then her Sister & brothers because she works hard at what she has. Just stop complaining about the Financial debt. Everyone has some form of debt in one way or another. You can't escape it. Just go in head first pal.

Once you find true submission, love, and fear for Allah, believe me brother, nothing in this life is worth or even comes close to the safety and comfort you will find with your Lord.<br>  <br>  It is a blessing that these things you mention, although can be seen as fun, are temporary. This is so because even if you do everything on your list, you will not find fulfillment because it is all temporary. This way you will turn to your Lord even after you have exhausted this life for what it can offer (which is nothing).<br>  <br>  I wish you luck in your trial.|`|O4dXv6Wmaa	Well, there are two types of fun, buddy.<br>  One, is the kind that comes from the wrong desires -- that one is haraam. <br>  The other, is the kind we do when we are bored of life and want an adventure.

I wouldn't have my beautiful children.|`|QPd7PwDraa	I almost froze to death. It was at a camp I went to for a few years and I was in the last stages of hypothermia before anyone did anything to help me. I couldn't see, everything was black...I couldn't move and every muscle was fatigued to the point of pain...and I couldn't speak, because it took more energy than I had in me. They kept asking me questions and it was angering me, because I couldn't so much as nod my head to respond. I felt tired, extremely tired. The counselors stopped me from simply falling onto the beach and passing out...and they brought me to the nurse. They didn't really do anything to help me...just let me lay down.<br>  <br>  I was told later by a friend of mine who happens to be a doctor...that if I had fallen asleep on the beach, I wouldn't have woken up.|`|mjGSAGHyaa	Right after I was born, I almost died.

At least then I'd be my own boss and could work to my own hours.<br>  <br>  I would turn down a man's money - tanstaafl - he'll want it repaid one way or the other [usually the other] and the repayment is always more than the amount of money involved - cos you'd lose autonomy, self-respect, any feeling of self-woth at all.  at least, I would|`|eNR2iot8aa	Couldn't do it although it is appealing I couldn't sell myself short like that.

I say stick with your morals and respect your self and you will find a man that will respect you. A sugar daddy will expect a little sugar from his sugar baby and that will make you a prostitute. If I were a woman I prob would be a gold digger and no sex would even be considered unless we were talking close to six figures...lol Becareful though about being a gold digger because once your labled it will be hard to change the image and when your ready to settle down a real gentlemen would most likely never consider you or take you serious for a relationship.|`|a8e0d2e391b61e5f44dbc705b38f8642aa	Just go for it, we all look initially for the "commodities" in people. Wealth, attractiveness, security, excitment etc. In the end if what your into makes you happy and the the other person happy who cares. The guy gets what he wants, the girl gets what she wants. If you find happiness you will probably find some love down the road. If not , well at least you and him had some fun for a little while. Just make sure that there is some balance.

HOW ARE YOU?  Notice the (?)  It bothers me as well.  They feel they don't have to answer or what?  What bothers me even more is when someone says "How are you?" and doesn't even listen to your response.  They don't really want to know, just filling dead air with "conversation.
fc9oxG8iaa	They were never really interested in killing them all, they just held a grudge for a millenai due to the murder of their saviour. They don't call themselves Neo/Reformed Jews because their practices are unalike, and they specifically follow a bloke called Christ.|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	Although a few individual Christians are of Jewish (tribe of Judah) descent - Christians are, as a whole, not Jews. Therefore they are not new or reformed Jews.<br>  <br>  Only false Christians tried to wipe Jews from the planet. Doing so went against Jesus' teachings. Jesus said to love are neighbors; Jesus even said to love our enemies. Jesus said their would be counterfit Christians. (Matthew 7:21-23)|`|AA11484395	Because the Jewish people do not recognize Jesus as the Savior, the Messiah. He is in the Jewish faith, at best, a great rabbi or teacher, perhaps a prophet, but he is not recognized as the savior.  People who followed Jesus when he was with us on this earth, and who listened to him, became his followers, they in turn taught others the things Jesus taught them, and so on, forming the basis for the Christian church.

Ow6lKFXiaa	It translates as "to cover, to veil, to shelter"<br>  <br>  Islam is not the only religion to require a woman's head be covered:   Mennonites, Amish, other Christian sects, Hasidic Jews.  You will find in the Old Testament somewhere (perhaps someone knows where to find it) a statement requiring women to cover their heads to humble themselves before G-d, since hair was a woman's main source of vanity back then.  In those days, men were also required to cover their heads in humble respect. That evolved into men wearing hats.  As time passed the formality of hats has fallen by the wayside.<br>  <br>  For dessert nomads the full length, face covering garment was protection from the harsh environment. While sons kept the family business, so to speak, daughters were given in marriage to strengthen tribal relations or business relations.   Most cultures did this, not just Middle Eastern ones.  Europe was especially big on this type of "marriage of convenience". (European cultures were also big on dowries which were a "payment" by the daughter's father to the groom). <br>  <br>  So Middle Eastern daughters were hidden under their dessert robes (very ornate ones for marriage negotiations) to keep some young lad from falling in love (or lust) and kidnapping her.  In short "to cover, to veil, to shelter"<br>  <br>  Some cultures have retained this practice of the hajib for religious and modesty purposes. <br>  <br>  Every culture has retained practices. Some have changed and evolved to the point no one know why it's done, like a bride wearing a veil or why we throw rice at the happy couple. Others practices have been retained with very little change.<br>  <br>  Edit: I mentioned men wearing hats; women still wear head coverings and hats to places of worship.  For Jew, it pretty much expected to for both men and women to cover their heads before G-d in a house of worship.  Many Christian woman wear fancy hats to church.  These fancy hats evolved from the practice of covering one's head in piety.|`|5GL2eFhyaa	Its a choice<br>  <br>  The hijab is for modesty. Women wear it to cover themselves so men will not be distracted by their beauty.<br>  <br>  men also need to cover themselves, though outside of the middle east this is rarely seen.<br>  <br>  It is not a means to control women.

So the hijab kind of developed as a cultural thing; I know plenty of muslims who are perfectly religious but do not wear a hijab (but of course don't wear short skirts etc.) and some who are not that religious but still wear a hijab as their parents make them...<br>  Apparently the prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) wives veiled themselves, too, so this is seen by some as the mark of a pious life.<br>  Of course, people wear them in different ways; it doesn't matter as long as their hair is covered!|`|f9hHqA1Vaa	who cares|`|FV7SkAcIaa	well we say put a bag over their head and do it for ol glory kinda on the same lines but they never remove it|`|AA11718880	What do we care?|`|4rWPX8CTaa	It's a primitive religious custom.

q0gRmHlUaa	I see the activities in the Mormon temple (as a former member) in much the same way that I see Scientology's Xenu doctrine.  If the non-members saw the rituals in the temple, particularly the endowment, it would substantially impact the LDS church's conversion efforts in a very negative way.  This idea is dressed up in a number of different ways but the end result is the same, until someone is sufficiently conditioned (or prepared) they would be driven away by the ceremony.|`|b7Lo5IAZaa	They are promises made between you and Heavenly Father. For example like the covenants made a baptism, just at a more responsible level. They are symbolic and made to be kept reverent. If you just go about discussing them lightly it would diminish the purpose and people wouldn't take the responsibility seriously of entering into those covenants. Which I don't think Heavenly Father would appreciate people making promises to him, then backing out of them, or not taking them seriously, and in a sense mocking him. So when someone makes that commitment to enter the temple it seems appropriate that it not be discussed in a casual manner.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	First, there are certain things the scriptures specifically tell us not discuss.  So the more we talk about them, the closer we come to revealing them.  <br>  <br>  Revelation 2:17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. <br>  <br>  Secondly, in the temple I learn spiritually and symbolically.  If I discuss the details, even with members, I will diminish the learning experience.|`|AA10637643	It's not even that we "aren't allowed" to talk about it.  Those of us who have been through the temple and understand the sacred and symbolic nature of the gospel, hold it as just that: sacred.  It is something so important to us, so holy, so special, that we don't really even want to tell it to anyone else.  There is a reason why the Lord wants those who attend His temples, to be living a certain standard.<br>  <br>  Think about the most sacred thing in the world to you.  Mine would probably be my intimate relationship with my husband.  It is not secret, but it is special to me.  So special that I don't post pictures on the internet, speak about every little detail, or even go around telling strangers about things we have done together.  Is it secret?  No.  It's special.  Same thing with the temple, something so very special that we don't go blabbing about it.<br>  <br>  Ex-mormons DO talk about is, sadly.  It means nothing to them and probably never did, and that's probably why they DO talk about it.  Very sad.|`|VPtqM31Paa	One reason I am trying not to say much on the subject is because there are parts that are not to be spoken of...it is just easier to treat the whole topic with caution.<br>  <br>  I think I said  too much one time (but nothing that was forbidden)...but still - I gave more information than was needful to be given...and I feel regret for that...So I am personally just trying to set a larger boundary for myself, so that I keep sacred that which is sacred.|`|jwl08lOqaa	The simple answer is because we're asked not to speak about it.  Obedience to gospel principles is a key element in our religion.<br>  <br>  Pinkadot - don't presume to have walked in the shoes of all ex-mormons.  Their experiences are not yours and you really have no idea how much faith those who've walked a different path had nor what led them to fall away.|`|0T3weRh5aa	It's not secretive..you can find things on the internet<br>  <br>  It's very sacred, it's teaches us how to make convenants with our Heavenly Father. The rest is just ceremonial stuff....|`|f4e89595d8a00252b0e37dcd7670e690aa	"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you." (Matt. 7:6; KJV)<br>  <br>  Sacred and secretive are very different.  "Sacred" describes something that is holy.  "Secretive" describes a person who is reticent about sharing information.  We aren't "secretive" by nature but when it comes to the temple rituals there are certain things we don't discuss.<br>  That being said, I think the verse I quoted above is helpful in understanding why we don't talk about it.  Unfortunately, the nature of those who are not believers in what someone else believes is often to belittle or make light of that belief.  Even if you are not that type of person, would you honor and respect our rituals if I discussed them with you?  How can I know you wouldn't share them with somebody who definitely would not?  And even if you did respect and honor that which was sacred, would you be ready for it if I told you?  Probably not.  Which is why the Savior's counsel about "pearls" is applicable to the temple rituals.  (Please note that this is a metaphor He was using.  I do not, nor does He, think of you as a swine or a dog).<br>  If you want, I can make this even more plain.  Think of something else that is sacred.  I would submit that there are certain family memories that are sacred that all of us have.  Perhaps something that a family member did for you that really showed how much they loved you.  Now imagine that someone who does not place the same value on your family memories wants you to share that experience.  Imagine that they may share that with someone who will mock you for it or, even more likely, will not cherish it the same way you do.  Would you be so gung-ho about sharing it?  Probably not.  Certain things are just too sacred to be shared.  I'm not trying to be rude either but I just don't understand why that is difficult to understand.  But I appreciate you asking and hope this helps.<br>  So what can we tell you about the temple rituals?  Simply this: that everything we learn and all the covenants we make, you can find in the Bible.  It's all there, if you look for it.  And you don't even have to look very hard.|`|WyICbuPqaa	If the temple ceremonies were common knowledge, it would diminish their spirituallity.  As it is, they are a precious gift, and a very spiritual experience for the initiate.  The words of the ceremonies alone cannot convey the sheer power of the spirit that resides within those walls.  It has to be experienced to be appreciated.<br>  <br>  I remember the first time I stepped inside a temple.  Peace descended on me like a blanket.  I knew without any doubt that the spirit of God was there, and permeated the building.  It was one of those signs that follow those that believe.  First a person exercises faith, and then comes the miracle.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	There are mysteries to any religion. LDS take these mysteries further when we are in our temples. Not everyone can go to the Temple, non members of course, and even some LDS are not able to go.<br>  <br>  I have always been taught that if you reveal all the mysteries to any faith then the mysteries lose their meaning and significance.

What makes superhero stories so great is how vague they are about how things occur.<br>  <br>  Think about the difference between drawing rockets on paper and building rockets. The two are related, but not necessarily in a 1:1 ratio, since the person doing the drawings isn't taking into account each and every factor that could affect the final outcome.<br>  <br>  Let's take the idea of flight, #1 superpower. How fast are you traveling? How many calories is your body using while flying? Does the speed at which you travel make it harder for you to breathe, making you prone to blackouts (and if you think blacking out in an airplane is bad, try blacking out while its just you in your skin.) If you increase one person's ability to horizontally and vertically travel, without any subsequent increase or modification in their other physiological and/or biological organs, will the new modification cause the organism to self-destruct? Biological self-preservation is the body's main impetus for creation, not ego satisfaction or social standing.<br>  <br>  People push past human boundaries all the time, but they do so in increments. Vast leaps create vast amounts of defects, since the system isn't proven yet. Think about areas of intelligence. We aren't vastly smarter now than we have ever been in existence, although many people show remarkable potential for growth far beyond anything so seen and understood. Yet, often, such people are not nurtured but disfigured by their gifts, since the systems put into place are meant to deal with people of only average intelligence.<br>  <br>  In other words, giving people really fast shoes but putting them in really small boxes (socially, emotionally, physically, psychologically speaking, etc.) is a great way to make them run into walls, crash and break, not break through.|`|HUf3J450aa	Genetically speaking, yes, though they'd stop being 'superpowers' then and start being normal.

3RQkgTSOaa	If you Google "BMI" (short for Body Mass Index), it will give you a rough idea of where you should be weight-wise for your height. Bear in mind that the BMI is an AVERAGE. Your actual ideal weight-to-height ratio may be a little higher or lower depending on your metabolism and your genetics.<br>  <br>  At 5'7" and 270 lbs. I can safely say that you do need to lose more weight. You've already lost 30 lbs. so CONGRATULATIONS! Keep up the good work! Be aware that being in college sometimes causes young people to overindulge since they are in charge of their own meals away from Mom (or Dad). Be vary wary of what you eat and how much you eat. It will be very easy to let yourself go so keep an eye on temptation. With that freedom of making your own meal plan comes the option to make GOOD choices. Many college cafeterias and mess halls are much more conscious of offering heart healthy choices. You can splurge every now and then (seriously, pizza and Coke is the ONLY food for all-nighters!) but don't make it a habit.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are some gay men who are attracted to larger guys. Generally, like attracts like so the more weight you lose, the broader the dating field will become. And, yes, the gay population seems to be looks driven. But be very careful of buying into the whole "if you're not toned, muscular and tanned" no one will want you. There are WAY to many people in this world to believe that there isn't at least a small contingent of guys looking for someone just like you.<br>  <br>  Additional weight loss will probably help with your self-consciousness and self esteem issues. You may also want to speak to a counselor to help you with some of these issues and keep you focused.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on getting into college and opting to change your life.

The problem is there may be organisms or microbes which are not native to Ohio in the sand from Hawaii which may have a harmful effect on the ecosystem in Ohio. This is a very small possibility, but that's the reason why you can't do it because the possibility does exist.

D6FBLQfwaa	I wonder Pastor Hoe...are your constant assaults on the LGBT section because you re an arrogant piece of white trash? Or is it something deeper? Perhaps you weren't allowed enough access to your mother's tit as a child, so now you're constantly grabbing and suckling anything that makes you feel better, in this case, spreading hate and rhetoric that only results in you looking like a complete fool and a stupid uneducated bully. I have no doubt that this comment will be removed since It violates the guidelines, but I am beyond happy that I was able to speak to you about the bastardy way you treat my brothers and sisters in the LBGT community. Oh, and by the way, It is I who has been following you and flagging every single one of your stingy, ignorant, hate comments, and I don't intend to stop. It sickos like you that result in the suicide of hundreds of LGBT children adults each year. Its sickos like you that drain the self-esteem of children so low, that they end up with multiple mental disorders and sometimes death. There is NOTHING wrong with being LGBT. But you bash it so that you can feel better about your own pathetic existence..|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	She's got to come to terms with this if she's making herself that unhappy. Marrying someone as cover is not a good idea at all. It's not fair to the husband, obviously. She's old enough to not be dependent on her family, so in my opinion, she should talk to her husband and then talk to her family, and hope for the best. It sounds like she'll agree she can't live like that forever, so something has got to give, and I think it'll have to be the husband. I'd be so angry if I were him. She's gone and made a huge mistake in her life, and she'll have to clean it up.

But they didn't love me back and that hurts like hell eh?) Anyway, I don't want to bore you with that sob story.<br>  <br>  I'm going to put myself in your place. What would I do if the one person I'm in love with is engaged, but unhappy? I mean I wouldn't care anymore that she wasn't with me- because her happiness is the most important thing in the world. But lucky for you, you are the only thing that can make her happy. She needs to ask herself which would be more painful to let go of- you, or her family. I mean I can see her side of it too- if my parents weren't crazy hippies that tell me they'll always love me, I would have been scared to come out too. Mabye they don't need to know about you guys for a while. Unless you like, get married or something. All I know is, I would do anything in my power to be with someone I love, and am loved by. <br>  <br>  Plenty of straight people live with their best friends- it's not uncommon.

m7730ZPPaa	On the whole, I don't think Korean pop music is fundamentally different from Japan's or Taiwan's. In all three countries you'll find the cutesy pop idols, as well as more hip-hop derived stuff. Right now there's a lot more overlap than there used to be in Asian pop culture, so you'll see more similarities.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing in Korean pop culture of the past few years are its television dramas. They've been exported to Japan, Taiwan, and other Asian countries (w/ subtitles, of course) and are huge, huge hits. One of the big stars of these dramas is an actor named Bae Yong-joon, who has become a huge star in Japan as well as Korea. I've heard that Japanese housewives are even going to Seoul these days to take a Bae Yong-joon "reality tour."<br>  <br>  As for the difference in English ability, I'm not sure it's as simple as that. There is a national mania for learning English in S. Korea right now, and huge amounts of money are being spent on private tutoring and cram schools. But so far the effect of this is limited to the smallish segment of the population that has the money for this. The supposed burst in English ability has been anticipated for several years now but still hasn't come. In Japan, learning English is important but perhaps not to the same degree. Also, the declining birthrate in Japan means that getting into college is much easier than it used to be, so as a result we're seeing college students with lower English proficiency in the past. But in both places the amount of required class time spent on English is about the same. I've observed English classes in both countries and I'm not convinced there's a real difference in level. Just my two cents there.<br>  <br>  <br>  Korean pop culture (extract information you want):-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_culture_of_South_Korea" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporar...</a>|`|R1Fc344laa	all i know are the wonder girls..dunno hwo to answer the rest sorrryy|`|1jnRkg4maa	if u wanna know more about korean celebs plz email me and i'll answer personally :D <br>  its a big impact in korea because it is one of the main industries there. music is like number one in their life.if ur musically tlaented their u will be succesful in life. why people want to become one? what exactly do you mean? do they want the popularity? here as in usa right? well you know what companies the celebs come from lol ex[Sm Entertainment,SHINee,DBSK,SuperJunior,Jy... girls,YG - big bang] i mean i don't know what companies rhianna and jordin sparks or with or whatever lol. showing skin in korea is like "OMG!!! they showed skin!" like they've never seen it before. in us "OMG! that's hot" or omg shes a slut >.>. <br>  ___________________ <br>  this is all my opinion which means i might or maybe not evene right :D <br>  lahh~GaEul<3YiJung

U8oR3VU6aa	She may have thought you were casing the place for someone, there have been many robberies and murders done that started like this.

The manager does not want teenagers loitering around the property because it could potentially turn customers off, as odd to you as that may sound. You are not threatening, but it is still annoying to see teenagers going in and out of a place of business like it is their home.<br>  <br>  Edit: What the poster above me said is very true - a lot of times people are there to "scope" out the place, and gas stations are very vulnerable to robberies as it is. Just do the management a favor and go somewhere else - hang out at the mall or a local coffee store.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	I do agree with you on your part, but there is a thing called "Overstaying your welcome".  I know the issue too cause I live in a small town.  Gas Station these days will more likely not have the parking for a whole bunch of people, just customers.  Some will have customer parking cause of a small diner seat tingthat they could have.

It doesn't matter what there is to do in your town, you can't just hang around a gas station. You buy what you need and leave. You don't sit in your car in the parking lot and finish your drink! You need to hang out somewhere else. A park, a mall, a friends house, your own home. I don't know what ever gave you the thought that it would be okay to stop in the same gas station three times in one night. It makes you look very strange.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	It's called loitering, and the business has every right to make you leave if you are not purchasing anything.

Probably because bored people get into trouble all the time, and stores don't want trouble to scare away other customers. <br>  <br>  You need to find some other place to make the social hot spot where you won't look like you're casing the joint.

iw9yogtMaa	Of course they should.<br>  <br>  There's plenty to learn online and perhaps that should be more encouraged by parents. And I don't mean just going to Yahoo Answers to get someone else to do your homework. I mean actually finding your own answers and then getting some assistance. Finding areas of interest and actually learning about them.  Reading the news and actually learning where you live.  Developing a knowledge base.<br>  <br>  Social networking is fine and in some ways can be safe but it seems to breed not only some obsessions but also an odd type of loneliness.<br>  <br>  It really is up to parents to take on the role of parenting by providing not only an example but also guidance.<br>  <br>  There may need to be limits.  The computer should not be the babysitter.  It should not be the best friend.  It would be very sad if it were the friend surrogate.<br>  <br>  But gaming teaches some skills.  Music is less expensive online.<br>  <br>  The world is different now.  Having real computer skills is important for everyone.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	I say NO.

It comes from not appreciating the life we have now and taking it for granted.<br>  <br>  If you're feeling like you should've died, you're saying that God messed up. God doesn't make errors and if you're still alive, there's a reason for it. You can either continue to drudge through life, unhappy, thinking about death, or you can snap out of it, realize that God gave you the gift of life, and live for Him. The choice is yours. It's your life.

And it is understandable that he would seem very special when he is working hard to be a good missionary, doing service for others, and sharing the Gospel. <br>  <br>  What you might have him do is introduce you to other young single adults in the Church.  That would give you the opportunity meet other young men, some even returned missionaries, who are able to date and who can help you develop some friends in the Church.<br>  <br>  You can also ask this missionary if you can email him while he is on his mission but remember to keep your emails completely platonic, (just friendly) and not suggest at any romantic feelings until he is released from his mission.

AA11047076	Inappropriate?  No- Unnecessary?  Yes.  But theres a big caveat there- if you do intend to convert, then it is actually good practice and not at all inappropriate.  <br>  <br>  However, just some comments if you try to follow a Jewish life when nto Jewish:<br>  1) If you claim to be Jewish but mix it with non-Jewish beliefs (as the Messianic Jews do) you WILL offend Jews.  We are not offended by non-Jews who carry out Jewish beliefs as long as they do not claim to be Jewish<br>  2) If you intend to try and keep Shabbos- break at least 1 Shabbos law during the day- the same is told to converts during their conversion until they go to mikveh.  the reason for this is that Shabbos is seen as being unique to Jews.<br>  3) Some authorities hold that  a non-Jew should change the text of many brachot (blessings) so that instead of "Baruch atah adonai elokeinu melech haolam asher kideshanu b mitzvotav" (followed by the rest of that particular brochah) "Blessed are you G-d, king of the universe, that sanctified us in your commandments" they should leave out "asher kideshanu b mitzvtav" as that only applies to peopel obligated (i.e. Jews) in the mitzvah.  When in a formal conversion programme the same restriction would not apply as the person is seen as practising for when they are obligated.

A Rabbi is there to help gauge how serious an individual is, teach one about Judaism, guide them through the conversion process and answer any/all questions that come up. <br>  <br>  What is the purpose of just blindly following commandments, if you don't understand *why* certain things are followed, and how they are followed in depth? <br>  <br>  With that said you could follow a few commandments, but you are not obligated to do so (outside of the Noahide laws) right now.

If you're not Jewish, you aren't obligated to keep them at all, so they're not technically commandments for you.  But if lighting a menorah or keeping the sabbath is meaningful to you, there's nothing that says you can't (though if you parents are Christian, lighting a menorah next to the Christmas tree in the front window would not be proper.<br>  <br>  Having said that, until you actually convert, it is not appropriate to make the blessing before performing commandments.  This is because the blessings are generally thanking G-d for commanding us to perform them, and as a non-Jew you were not yet commanded to do so.|`|JQSzAIY6aa	UMM Messianic Jews are Jews they are more  Jewish then the Orthodox Jews because they acknowledge and accept that Jesus is  their Messiah and Messianic Judaism doctrine is not about RELIGION its about Yeshua Ha'Mashiach and Hashem.

If the intention is decent - and it sounds as though yours IS - then nothing you DO will be disrespectful :)<br>  <br>  That said, I'm not sure what Orthodox Jews might say as I *think* there are certain 'rules' about non Jews keeping Shabbat; I'll star your post :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|AnC1CgRaaa	Hi. I'm sure that your friend's comment was well-intentioned, but it's not truly relevant to your case. Your sincerity is the key here.  (Based on your own words,  I would never compare you to the "Messianics" who believe in another deity that has nothing to do with Judaism. They are Christians. They are not the least interested in the G-d of the Torah. From our point of view, they may worship whom they wish; the problems arise when they misrepresent their own deity as appropriate for Jews.)  Only you know your own goals and intentions at this point. <br>  Overview plus links to groups here: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/2120/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/2...</a>  <br>  It is fine to slowly begin keeping commandments (mitzvot). It's essential to start by carefully observing the 7 categories of commandments given to the Nations/ the Bnei Noach. After you are comfortable with those categories, you can consider taking on others. It would be helpful for you to hook up with other Noachides at this point. Through appropriate online groups, you can receive advice from knowledgeble people (including Orthodox  rabbis) and be in contact with people similar to you. <br>  <a href="http://www.noahidenations.com/content/index.php?Itemid=46&id=11&option=com_content&task=section" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahidenations.com/content/in...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=16873400509&ref=ts" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=16...</a><br>  Other pertinent links:<br>  <a href="http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php/Jerusalem_Court_for_Issues_of_Bnei_Noah" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php...</a><br>  Approved prayerbook for Noachides:  "Service From the Heart"  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=+noachides+%22Service+From+the+Heart%22&btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=+no...</a>  <br>  There are books such as "The Path of the Righteous Gentile" by Chaim Clorfene and Yakov Rogalsky that may be of use. If and when you decide to take on additional commandments, it's more practical to slowly begin with what's posssible for you. As a non-Jew, it's not appropriate for you to entirely keep the Shabbat (until after conversion).  Even those who are about to convert (and have been keeping mitzvot for a long time ) must still break the Sabbath each week by committing at least one act that is forbidden to Jews.

They are Christians masquerading as Jews and we find them extremely offensive.  Period.<br>  <br>  Now--as to your question, if you really want to ultimately convert, then I don't see anything wrong with doing as much reading and studying as you can.  I wouldn't worry about trying to keep the commandments now--you're not obligated to until you convert.  However, if you have any Jewish friends, I'm sure they'd be happy to have you over for holidays, Shabbat, etc.<br>  <br>  Having said that--as a Reform Jew, I also don't see anything wrong with keeping the commandments now if you so choose (like keeping kosher, for example).  I'm not entirely sure what the Orthodox viewpoint would be--but I'll try to find out and come back to this Q if I do.<br>  <br>  [edit]  lol, it's Purim of course, so places like askmoses.com and my own LOR (local Orthodox rabbi) are elsewhere.  However I'll star this and perhaps someone like allonyoav will answer.|`|ndY6nU5Daa	I can see why your Christian friend would think that, and I appreciate the sentiment.  It shows a genuine concern, and there's no reason he/she would be aware of the distinction I and most of the above posters are making.  Your understanding of what's so offensive about the Messianics is correct.  As others have said, intent is key in whether this becomes a mockery.  What you are describing is not a mockery (even if at some point you accidentally do something that you weren't supposed to do), and is unrelated to the mimicry perpetrated by the Messianics.  <br>  <br>  That being said, one thing I would advise against is trying to do this by yourself.  So much of Judaism is about the community and tradition that isn't necessarily codified that I think you at least need to be in regular touch with someone who can give you guidance and support, even if it's not yet the formal conversion process.  Jewish practices can be confusing, and it's important to understand how following Jewish practices adds up to a Jewish life -- it's not just a series of laws and regulations.  It's almost impossible to do this on your own.<br>  <br>  Get in touch with a synagogue about the conversion process, and maybe you can even formally start it - with the understanding that you probably can't finish until you live in an area with a Jewish community.<br>  <br>  In fact, as part of the conversion process, one of the requirements is actually that you pretty much do what you're describing -- live according to Jewish law and tradition, with certain exceptions for things that you're affirmatively not permitted to do until your conversion is final (for example, as paperback points out, you're not supposed to strictly observe the sabbath until your conversion is final).  Your conversion-process rabbi can explain those to you.<br>  <br>  I wish you well.

AA12006309	It wouldn't work, because marriage itself isn't illegal.  Simply because a gay marriage isn't recognized by the state doesn't mean it's "illegal".  There are churches and congregations that marry gay couples all the time, even though the marriage is only recognized by God and their peers, and not the government.  It's not illegal, it's just not legally recognized.|`|420d72e7d945fb5cb4d470808614f009aa	They would laugh at you.  Many years ago, when having oral or anal sex was illegal, a felony, at that, three couples, male-female, male-male, and female-female marched into a police station and demanded to be arrested for violating this law.  The police refused, because they realized it would become a constitutional challenge and take up all their time.<br>  Practicing marriage without a valid license is not against the law.|`|AA11374522	It is impossible to be "illegally married." Many same-sex couples travel to other states and nations in order to obtain a marriage license. However, if the state and federal government in which they live doesn't recognize same-sex marriages then those governments will not grant marriage rights to the couple. They are still legally married in the state or country in which they obtained the marriage license but these rights will not transfer to a new location. The couple cannot secretly benefit from marriage rights if the marriage isn't recognized.|`|PNw70xuLaa	They can't do anything if they're already married, so they wouldn't arrest them and couldn't do anything. It's in the constitution that you can't take action against anyone if they broke a law before it was a law. But if they weren't married then they would probably arrest whomever was marrying them for practicing illegally. I don't know if anything would happen to the gay couple...

As soon as he told us and started dating guys, it was okay but then you get the typical "OOH...you're gay. Ha ha" crap.  It's ludicrous for people to do such a thing or even believe what they hear on the internet or anywhere.

Bsb9ALqgaa	There's 2 sides to this question. How long should it take to find a Buddhist teacher and how long should it take before you decide to stay on as a student.<br>  <br>  Answer - no fixed time limit. Just take as long as you want. Just make sure you don't leave it too long before making a commitment because meditation and prostrations etc get harder for the body when you reach 60.<br>  <br>  There should be no pressure or hard sell on you to join the Community if there is don't join. You need to make your choices no one else can do it for you. Shop around as long as you want. Test the teacher to see if they are ethical. Ask lots of questions they should love a "devil's advocate" but don't be violent that would be self defeating and they'll probably refuse you entry! Notice the teacher's behaviour - is it non-violent? Is he or she generous, kind, strict, truthful, mindful or sexually abusive? Do they want your money more than your questions. Do the positive qualities outweigh the negatives (they are human after all). Do you feel this person could teach you something useful or not despite the setbacks.|`|DArAz67Caa	it did not take me anytime-----for I am an Evangelical-----not a follower of the buddha----|`|ccf1380d8076cbe37300f50ef722bbf2aa	I am a buddhist, but I had no buddhist teacher :P.<br>  <br>  I think that was just a Tibetan buddhism tradition.

bfWcfCKXaa	Did they specifically list any restrictions on their offer? Did the offer say it must be matched with another online retail site? It depends on the terms of the offer whether you are being honest or not in accepting the discount. Ebay is not a retail site. Price match guarentees are usually for competing retailers. But, if the price match item was on the Ebay non-bidding, shopping section of their site, you may have a perfectly legitimate right to claim the item at the discount rate.

Sn0CViR7aa	In the Pope, we have not just a man who is the earthly head of the only church Jesus authorized and the spiritual leader of a billion Catholics: You have the man appointed by apostolic success to an office created by Jesus, charged to receive "the keys of the kingdom of heaven"; the current holder of Jesus promise, "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."<br>  <br>  Awesome responsibility, wouldn't you say?  I would certainly honor this man by genuflecting, as protocol requires.<br>  <br>  I wonder if our Japanese friends express incredulity at such an ordinary courtesy and acknowledgment of authority being treated so superciliously by our Protestant friends.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	No.  I'm Catholic, but there is enough Quaker in me to resist the idea of bowing to any human being.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean I don't respect the office of pope.  I do.  I just don't have to express that respect with a bow.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Yes i would bow and show respect for his Holiness. People have had it good for so long they have forgotten to appreciate our gifts or give thanks to God for all we have.When i was growing up giving thanks at meal time was always done as people worked very hard and there was not all these Government programs to feed the poor so it tended to make you thankful for what you did have even if all you had to eat was onion and potatoes in a soup.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I would at least bow, out of respect.   If genuflecting is the appropriate display of respect and gratitude,  I would genuflect.<br>    <br>  If I ever get to meet the Pope, I will try to learn in advance what is the proper etiquette.   In truth,  I would like to hug him, but I suspect that is considered too forward and improper.  <br>  <br>  I get the impression that Pope Benedict is a very warm man.  He is well-known for very faithfully defending Catholic doctrine,  as he has done throughout his ordained life.  This has led many  people to accuse him of being a cold enforcer of strict rules.  I think that is unreasonable.  <br>  <br>  As the product of almost 2000 years of scholarship guided by the Holy Spirit,  Catholic doctrine is beautiful.  To teach Catholic doctrine faithfully is an act of kindness,  and it is courageous to teach it faithfully when it is not popular.   I think our Pope is both kind and courageous,  and I actually would like to hug him if that is acceptable.   In all truth, I don't expect to meet him in this world. <br>  <br>  As you pointed out,  a bow is not an act of  worship.  To bow would be entirely appropriate.   I think the Pope is so worthy of our respect that to withhold an explicit display of great respect would be rudely disrespectful.   He is the Vicar of Jesus Christ.  I can't see any reason to justify withholding an overt display of respect for him personally, and especially as the Vicar of Christ.<br>  <br>  I hope you get to meet him some day.  I am confident that he would be able readily to perceive any genuine attempt to show him respect<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	i did (JP2) and i did. you actually couldn't help but try to show some form of respect for the man.  i don't think there is anything wrong.  there is a difference between a box out of respect, one out of fear and one forced as a form of worship.|`|h5q89E3Haa	Sure would!<br>  <br>  I would do the same meeting the Queen of England or any head of state. Lets not forget the Vatican is a Sovereign nation and the Pope is the head of State.<br>  <br>  People's hatred of the Catholic Church causes them to surrender all reason to Satan.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	When we genuflect for God/Jesus we bend the right knee.  When meeting the Pope we should bend the left knee.  I have never met a Pope, but I would bend my knee out of respect.<br>  <br>  According to a priest who used to be a regular around here.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	I would always follow proper etiquette. There are always different forms of greeting a person in authority, such as kings, presidents, dukes, etc, and the Pope is no different. <br>  <br>  I think too many look at someone practicing proper etiquette and call it idolatry/heresy/blaspheme/etc just because the person being shown respect is a church leader, when they would never say it when the person being shown respect is a secular leader.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Yes, as a sign of respect.  Or do whatever is the protocol like kissing the Pope's ring. I am Asian and Asians have no problems about bowing.  If we can bow to or kiss the hand of our parents to show respect, why can't we do the same to the representative (Vicar) of Christ?|`|xxEhpytpaa	Yes, for respect of his high office and for his blessing, and to kiss his ring. He represents Jesus Christ here on earth and should be respected and is respected. God bless you.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Of course I would. He is a world leader with a huge following, and he represents the Church. He is far more deserving of respect then most world leaders today. Pax Christi.|`|8ReUKb7Baa	Y E S !  Not only is he the Leader of my church ... but it is what, his<br>  the Holiness stands for and is  within his spirit.<br>  <br>  With mucho *   Respect ... i believe it is elementry my Dear|`|Jj8JlApvaa	Yes I would, <br>  for respect of the office he holds,|`|AA10034051	Yes I would, just as I would bow or curtsy to the Queen of England. It is a sign of respect<br>  <br>  Catholic Christian|`|RwpHV4nOaa	I would genuflect on my left knee - the left knee because the right knee is said to be reserved for the Blessed Sacrament - and kiss the Fisherman Ring. It's not worship as crazy fundamentalist protestants will tell you, it's respect for the office of the Papacy, because the Pope is Christ's vicar, how can we not give respect for that?!|`|eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Well I would go to the Bible for my response.  It reads as follows:<br>  <br>  "Render therefore to all their dues:  tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour." (Romans 13:7)<br>  <br>  Therefore, I would give the Pope the respect that is due to him.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Maybe, as a sign of reverence to God, for giving us the gift of the pope and for the blessings He bestows Pope Benedict. I have heard that it is a sign of respect to kiss a bishop's ring, as mentioned in the first answer.<br>  <br>  I would be reluctant to bow before the Queen of England or the President of the United States, because I think it would send the message that the Queen or President is somehow "better" than the average citizen.  An important principle taken from the Declaration of Independence is that all are equal, which is why America's founders did away with titles such as "His Majesty" and other titles of royalty. Sending the message that some people are less human than others is a violation of human dignity.<br>  <br>  I think in the case of the pope, a gesture such as a bow would not be misinterpreted, since he is such a humble man, and lives as though he is the servant of the servants of God, rather than just paying lip service to the fact that one in authority is to serve those over whom he or she has authority.<br>  <br>  "If you want peace, work for justice." -Pope Paul VI<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave|`|vQ75GgNnaa	He would probably offer me his hand to kiss in the tradition of Bishops.<br>  I would not kiss it but I would bow holding it in respect.<br>  He is, after all, the representative of Christ on earth, or should I say he represents Peter?<br>  What do you think is he like Christ or Peter?<br>  I met Pope John Paul II in 1995 in a Military base in Palermo Sicily where I was doing my one year compulsory military service (I am Italian from origins).<br>  He went around a few of us in line for him after he landed with his helicopter and shook our hands he didn't want any bows or hand kiss.<br>  He was the most friendly person I ever met he talked to a Tenent standing next to me and asked him where he was from and what was his duty, he didn't ask me anything but it was an experience anyway.|`|Bqoydq1Oaa	I agree with you. I think we're supposed to genuflect on the left knee? <br>  But Since when did bowing become equal to worship? I think we need to make it a habit to show respect to people, I feel like a people don't bother with courtesy much anymore.<br>  In the future, we may abandon handshakes, excuse-mes, and thank yous too?|`|TO4bRflyaa	I have never met the Pope in my life and it's a dream for me. I have immense respect for the man because he represents our church. I will definitely bow to him. He deserves it.<br>  <br>  I see a lot of hatred poured on him and the Catholic church everyday and this makes him more special. <br>  <br>  Ave Maria..|`|AcLjARwyaa	I would kiss his ring and whatever the protocol is.  I beleive bow an dring kissing.  It is a sign of respect for the  office.  I mean what would you do if you saw st. Peter?|`|39de4d27076c334630a8108a6bb9b519aa	Actually, as I believe Church doctrince states it is polite to genuflect (on a different knee or something) and kiss the ring of bishops and the Pope.|`|fc9oxG8iaa	I'm not a Catholic and I would, just as I would bow before your American President. It's called respect.
26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Yes, perhaps through misguided attempts to explain religion. Scientology comes to mind.|`|APjnSYKuaa	Was that opinion approved by the Temple of Syrinx?|`|2ogimlBxaa	Only if they worship it.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Socrates said that a key rule in Philosophic argument is that you have to define your terms, in this case the term "religion".  The word itself is from the ME "religioun", itself from the L "religio"="respect for what is sacred", which then leads to the question of what you consider "sacred".  As I learned it "religion" was defined as "the service or worship of God or the supernatural"* so no belief system which didn't include that practice in some form, like modern science, could be considered a religion nor could it be used as one.  That fact that the Christian Churches have chosen to describe ethical and spiritual systems that don't include worship or even the acknowledgment that a god exists, like Buddhism, Taoism or atheism, as religions doesn't make the description valid.  If we insist on stopping all arguments at the level of word definition we end up like Clinton arguing "it depends on what your definition of the word 'is' is".  As Abe Lincoln used to ask, "If you call a tail a leg how many legs does a dog have?"  Answer, "Four, calling a tail a leg don't make it one."  This is the sort of thing that makes me long for the days of established lexicography.|`|qbelhflAaa	WALL OF TEXT.

X548yCR6aa	It was John the Baptist. In fact, Jesus's little following was a spinoff of the more popular cult of John the Baptist. And it remained less popular until Constantine.<br>  <br>  There are even some of John's followers remaining to this very day.

To make it into smaller groups we could say that all teachers are bad when we know that there are many more who are good. We can say that all policemen are bad but we know that there are many more who are good. Our own experiences with people cause some to make judgements that all are the same. I am American and in no way offended by your question. It is like saying that all Jewish people are money pinchers, all Muslims are bad, all black people are not intelligent. We cannot generalize a whole group of people. It is human nature in all the world there are many, many who are good and kind and then in human nature in all the world are people who aren't good.  some tend to make judgements by the experiences that they have had not looking at the fact that also there are those who care and would do anything to help you.  Could we say that all Germans are bad because of the Halocaust no it was a large group who was evil. Many,many German people are good people and did not participate in the evil.  People are people wherever they come from there are the good and the bad. But it isn't possible for all of one group to be uncaring or rude. You can walk in the cities of the US and find those who would help you, save you at the risk of their own lives the same as in any other country.|`|pRTFjaK4aa	no.  every race has kind and unkind people.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	no we are  all people, the same human race

For instance, when Europeans came to the New World, millions of Native Americans died from diseases brought by the Europeans, diseases that Europeans considered minor, like measles, flu, etc.  Because the Europeans had lived with these diseases for centuries and had grown tolerant of them. To the Native Americans they were new diseases so they were deadly.<br>  <br>  You could do this with any population of the same species.  Take a bacteria culture in a petri dish and dose it with enough antibiotic to kill 90%.  When the population grows back, it is descended from the 10% who were most resistant to the antibiotic, so now they can stand the same dose of antibiotic with only 10% mortality.  Do this several times, increasing the dose each time to kill 90%, and you end up with a strain of the bacteria that is almost completely immune to the antibiotic.  This is the same species of bacteria, but it's changed.  Creationists call this micro-evolution.  They point out that it's possible to change a species but not to create a new species.<br>  <br>  Humans who lived in different parts of the world have changed too, over thousands and even millions of years.  They look different, they eat different foods and sometimes can't tolerate each other's foods--like Asians are often lactose intolerant because they didn't eat dairy products for thousands of years.  They are adapted to different climates. But they are still the same species, so much so that our blood and organs are interchangeable!  You can get a transfusion or a kidney transplant from a black person and your body can't tell the difference.<br>  <br>  As for the brain, well in a way you're right.  But these differences are cultural.  Even today, black culture is different from white culture in the US.  Both contribute to each other, though.  And the difference is less with time.  Only 150 years ago it was illegal to teach a black person to read in half of the US, even a FREE black person!  For 100 years after the Civil War,blacks were kept separate in the South, they had their own neighborhoods, parks, churches, movie theaters, grocery stores, etc.  No wonder they stayed different so long.  There is no real evidence that blacks are any dumber than whites or that Asians are smarter.  The difference is only cultural, with some cultures stressing education and life success more than others.|`|hQWucH5uaa	All three main races are of one species: homo sapien.<br>  <br>  Homo sapiens are dived into three races: *******, Caucazoid, and Mongaloid (Latin names for objectivity).<br>  <br>  Each of the three races are divided into ethnic groups: Polish, Lithuanian, Japanese, Han Chinese, Korean, Hottentot, Negrito, Bantu, Cherokee, Apache, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Yet every human being on the planet Earth is of one single specie: homo sapien.<br>  <br>  So yes all the races are the same.  The ethnic groups vary: genotypye determines phenotype as my anthropology and genetics professors stated.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Actually, scientists have not shown that Africans have any physical difference from Europeans, other than skin color and hair texture. There is no proof of extra muscles or differences on the brain or anything like that. Europeans also hunted and gathered for thousands of years. <br>  Scientists HAVE shown that humans are the most genetically similar of any species. Among groupings of 1,000 alleles, any humans will probably have 1 or 2 alleles different from any other human, regardless of race. Fruit flies will have 10X as many different alleles!|`|pnZssBg9aa	If all races are not the same then each race will be a different subspecies of Homo Sapiens Sapiens, wouldn't it? The genetic differences between races are so minor it is statistically insignificant - in fact, the percentage of genetic differences between two separate races is much lower than the percentage of genetic differences between two different people of the same race.

The Ka'ba was purged of its idols, and the monotheistic motif of the rituals associated with the pilgrimage was restored.

The people said 'Abu'l Hafs (Umar), Fatima (daughter of Rasulullah (s)) is also in this house'. Umar replied, 'I do not care about this, people should leave the house of 'Ali and give bayya'.

Then I told him:<br>  "Rather, you are, by Allah, more greedy, although more remote, while I am more suited as well as nearer. I have demanded it as my right, while you are intervening between me and it, and you are turning my face from it." When I knocked at his ears with arguments among the crowd of those present he was startled as if he was stunned not knowing what reply to give me about it.<br>  O' my Allah! I seek Thy succour against the Quraysh and those who are assisting them, because they are denying me (the rights of) kinship, have lowered my high position, and are united in opposing me in the matter (of the caliphate) which is my right, and then they said, "Know that the rightful thing is that you have it and also that you may leave it." <br>  <br>  On the occasion of the Consultative Committee Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas repeated to Amir al-mu'minin what Caliph `Umar had said in his last hours namely that "O' `Ali, you are very greedy for the position of caliphate," and `Ali replied that, "He who demands his own right cannot be called greedy; rather greedy is he who prevents the securing of the right and tries to grab it despite being unfit for it."<br>  <br>  There is no doubt that Amir al-mu'minin considered the Caliphate to be his right, and demanded his right. The demand for a right does not dispel a right so that it may be put forth as an excuse for not assigning him the caliphate, and the demand may be held as a mark of greed. Even if it was greed, who was not involved in this greed? Was not the pull between the muhajirun and the ansar the mutual struggle between the members of the Consultative Committee and the mischief mongering of Talhah and az-Zubayr the product of this very greed. If Amir al-mu'minin had been greedy for this position, he would have stood for it, closing his eyes to the consequences and results, when `Abbas (uncle of the Prophet) and Abu Sufyan pressed him for (accepting) allegiance, and when, after the third Caliph people thronged to him for (swearing) allegiance, he should have accepted their offer without paying any attention to the deteriorated conditions. But at no time did Amir al-mu'minin take any step which could prove that he wanted the Caliphate for the sake of caliphate, but rather his demand for the caliphate was only with the object that its features should not be altered and the religion should not become the victim of others' desires, not that he should enjoy the pleasures of life which could be attributed to greed.<br>  <br>  [2].Explaining the meaning, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes that Amir al-mu'minin's intention was to say:<br>  <br>  They (the Quraysh and those who are assisting them) were not only content to keep me away from my right over the caliphate which they have usurped (from me), but rather claimed that it was their right whether to give it to me or prevent me from the same; and that I have no right to argue with them.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the intention (of Amir al-mu'minin) is that:<br>  <br>  If they had not said that it is right to keep away from the caliphate, it would have been easy to endure it because this would have, at least, showed their admitting my right although they were not prepared to concede it. (Sharh Nahj al-balaghah, vol. 9, p. 306)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  So... think twice for next time when you want to say that Imam Ali (as) cooperated with them...
hWvvrEphaa	Hey, I'm a christian and I think Buddha is great. I think Buddhism is more of a way of life than a religion. Buddhists tend to be very enlightened and spiritual. They respect people and animals and they love the earth. <br>  <br>  Obviously I don't worship Buddha I worship Jesus, but the way of Buddha is really nice. :)|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I must admit that I've never heard that before, but I am a Buddhist so perhaps they didn't say it around me.<br>  <br>  We do not worship a false god.  We believe that God is in everything, including ourselves, animals, plants, rocks, trees, air...everything.<br>  <br>  We do not worship some god in the sky and I think that's why they must think we're evil.  What's evil is judging others for their beliefs, so it's obvious they think you should either believe in their beliefs or you are evil.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is sad....|`|8Hj9oxVDaa	Buddhism isn't a religion so they need to get that out of their head. <br>  Buddhism is a philosophy and a way of life. The reasons why, is because christians think if you show respect to someone who is deceased who is not Jesus, its inherantly evil.<br>  Just ignorance on thier behalf.

From what u describe, he seems to me like the kind of guy who in a way is "power hungry" if u know what I mean.

Now I may be completly wrong, but I couldn't imagine talking to a girl I might marry about all that.

You can be an atheist, meaning that you do not believe in god, but say that even if he existed you wouldnt follow him. Thats how I believe.

Atheism is not as limited a label as the others.|`|oVHFz52Laa	How cute.<br>  <br>  Of course one can call themselves an atheist but that does not mean one is.<br>  <br>  I had an answer earlier today from an atheist that it is a nice thing to accept non-Christians as Christians if they want to be called Christians. Of course this person does not believe in true Jesus or that anyone is true Christian( since he does not believe in Christ ), so the person is fine with letting all people call themselves Christians if they want to, but this person himself does not think  that they are true Christians ( since there are no true Christians ). So, using the same theory, YES, you,one, can be an atheist and believe in God even a little bit if you really want. Real atheists might not accept one as a real atheists - but it is a nice thing to let people to believe whatever they want to - go figure if these ' a little bit God Believing atheists' would start to go door to door to tell everyone that they are the true atheists and not the ones who do not believe in any gods,God, goddesses...lol lol lol<br>  <br>  Sorry, I know I am silly, and tired ; )|`|ccf1380d8076cbe37300f50ef722bbf2aa	Which atheist believes in god?

Do whatever you want.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I am all game in the bedroom when it comes to my partner and I. I don't feel embarrassed by anything. We have tried A LOT and will continue to try.<br>  <br>   You know the saying, "treat me like a lady, f#CK me like a whore" :) Or is that inappropriate?|`|mjGSAGHyaa	No, tie her to a wall and stick a ball gag in her mouth. God doesn't judge once you're married; in fact, he'll probably kick back in his God-recliner with a bag of godcorn and watch you go at it.|`|UO3i8BqVaa	I don't think they like the thought of buttsecks which is a shame as sexually repressed fundie is preoccupied with it.<br>  ~|`|6709f9f8b081a814a21bfcf6aade68e3aa	If a man's penis is so long and they make love in a position so as to make it go really deep and cause an abortion, then yeah.|`|gQEFy4BVaa	If your wife consents, I don't see how it's anyone else's business.
DArAz67Caa	because it is the WORD OF GOD------cave pantings are the scribbles of ancient primitives----pretty to look at----yet serve no significant purpose-|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) What makes the bible more important than some prehistoric cave paintings?<br>  <br>  The bible is a document with historical - and even archaeological and architectural - value covering a period of several centuries.  Prehistoric cave paintings are, well, on the one hand "prehistoric", and (as a result) not *very* informative regarding the societies from which they came, and they additionally have little other than environmental- and sociological- historical value.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) they're essentially the same thing<br>  <br>  Considering this statement, I am surprised that your literacy has achieved the point that you are able to type it.  Seriously - the merest look through the bible, WITHOUT reading, in comparison with a look through prehistoric paintings makes it clear that they are very different types of things.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|AA10556726	Well it does give a clearer viewpoint of the culture(s) that wrote it than cave paintings do.  It also is a good source of information about locations and some civilizations.<br>  <br>  The religious message is a different matter though.  It's valuable as an insight into then and how it shaped people that read it, but not worth much after that.|`|db1f8e62fd58ac84968281e4a393decfaa	The Bible is the only scriptures that have been around for some 4000 years, ( New Testament 2000 years ) with man trying to destroy it all that time. With all the attempts to do away with the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures, here they are. And in better shape, and with more supporting documents than any other writings of the ancient world.<br>  <br>  Also it is inspired by God, and the Holy Spirit would not allow anything to be kept in the Scriptures, or taken away from them. ( This only applies  to those who believe in God )<br>  <br>  God be with you on your journey,<br>  William the least|`|OugNf0x6aa	Cave paintings were the way of communication in the Stone Age. The Bible is just a fabricated fairy tale. And for Losasha, the paintings were more important since it was the age where people could begin to communicate.|`|vL8JErXNaa	Not a thing|`|xOBn4gF6aa	umm....actually there is a huge difference. Cave paintings just tell you about prehistoric life.....about what happened. The Bible is the Holy Word. Cave paintings were made by humans, The Bible was spoken by God (people wrote down what God spoke....) Every single word in the Bible is true, cave drawings are things by people telling what they believed or something. There is a big difference....hard for me to explain...ask a pastor or something ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (oh and how would you know that they were the same thing...have you read the Bible??)|`|isZlvJpcaa	they are totally different. cave paintings are...yes, set in stone. the bible is open to change, so people freely change it and make new versions. (making it the word of man instead of god.)|`|fc9oxG8iaa	I see your point, but apparently the paintings not containing the words "This is the word of God" is not enough for some.|`|dPI8VibNaa	except the bible is fabricated|`|QUg9W2NGaa	The Bible is the word of God and your ignorance gave me 2 points. Later|`|P1Sl55Coaa	They both prove evolution is a false religion.  What exactly do you mean?
4KNESOnlaa	Because TROLLS hate everyone.....|`|4Vmlf902aa	Well you shouldn't hate all Mexicans because of bad experiences! Who cares about those stereotypes about them.
