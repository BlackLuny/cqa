TPGOM1EGaa	Actually, it is possible to replace graphics cards on a laptop, just not very easily done. For one thing, they must be compatible with each other in heat and energy consumption, etc. It requires you to desolder the previous video card and solder on a new one. It depends on the laptop, but if you aren't good with a soldering iron and don't know what you are doing, I wouldn't suggest it.|`|2vL8wOHZaa	I am sorry to inform you that you can't upgrade the graphics chip in a laptop. most laptops are a video chip not a video card like you might find in a desktop pc. There are some laptops that have a dedicated video card in them but even they can't be upgraded due to them being soldered right to the mother board. I hope this helped.|`|MxculX2Daa	Laptop = can't be done.<br>  The graphics chip is not on a separate card. It is soldered onto the main motherboard. You can't change it.

AA11703028	hi tochy<br>             restoring your pc back to its "factory settings" will basically remove all drivers and software thats currently installed on your p.c and this will mean you need to re-install all the drivers such as display and sound drivers aswell as your bt setup disk<br>               your internet connection will only be affected until you re-configure your wireless network adapter,however ethernet connections will not be affected since these are plug,n,play <br>              however most pc,s come with whats known as a "recovery disk" and this will return your p.c back to it "factory settings" and will also install all the nessecary drivers and software,this is because your recovery disk is unique to your pc and cannot be used on other pc,s<br>              some pc,s however may not come with a recovery disk and instead will have a ghost image of their pc,c operating system on a hidden partition on the hard drive,and this can be accessed by pressing a f key during the post screen(the black screen seen after you turn on your pc)<br>                the advantage of using this recovery procedue is you have the option to recover your p.c with or without loss of personal data however the recovery disk method will completely format your hard drive with total loss of data<br>                 to use the recovery disk you just insert the disk in your optical drive(dvdrw) and restart the pc,and when prompted you need to "press any key to boot from cd/dvd"( note : you may need to go into the pc bios to change the boot order,make sure the cd/dvd rom is the first bootable device,then remember to save and exit setup before you exit the bios..your pc will now restart again)<br>                to use the recovery partition method just press the pre-assigned key to start the recovery,and follow the prompts as they appear<br>                however once the recovery installations have begun they are much the same and are both just like installing windows the normal way,the only difference being is the installation this time installs drivers and software unique to your pc/laptop<br>                 note : if you are connected to the internet using a ethernet connection there is no need to install any bt software,however if you are using a wireless or usb connection you may need to run the disk,wireless connections can allthough be configured using the windows "wireless setup" option is control panel,or by using the wireless network software that come with your wireless network adapter<br>                  theres a excellent utility called " driver magician" which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.drivermagician.com/download.htm,this" rel="nofollow">http://www.drivermagician.com/download.h...</a> will scan your pc and make a back up of all your systems drivers which can then be saved on either memory stick or removable media(cdrw/dvdrw)<br>                 finally when reinstalling windows i make a check-list which i adhere to each time i reinstall windows,for example it will have a list of drivers and software that need to be installed and drivers that need to be installed,and as long as i keep to this check-list there wont be any problems<br>                also remember if you use the bt security software that comes with your bt option package you will need to install the software from the supplied disk or download them from <a href="http://www2.bt.com/static/i/btretail/consumer/broadbandlife/broadband_security_setup.htm?s_cid=con_FURL_netprotectplus" rel="nofollow">http://www2.bt.com/static/i/btretail/con...</a><br>                 any problems let me know<br>                        good luck tochy !|`|PuMsIIL6aa	Format your hard drive and re-instal windows.

KHSOVxViaa	BLOB stands for Binary Large Object.<br>  <br>  It is a data type that allows you to store binary data in the database.  this means you can store images, documents, or anything else you want.<br>  <br>  It's stored using a different method to other data types, so as to avoid any inefficiencies in large data-volume tables.<br>  <br>  BLOBs are commonly used to store binary data associated with other data in related tables.  An EMPLOYEE table may store details of an employee, such as name, address, age, etc.  If one of the fields in the table is a BLOB, then an image of the employee can be stored.<br>  <br>  This is often preferable to storing images in the file system, and having to store references to it in the table, as all the data is held in one place, and has a contiguous backup/security/clustering policy.<br>  <br>  Other uses include document storage, where many different types of document can be stored in one BLOB field, the MIME type being stored in the same table.<br>  <br>  MySQL has available several versions of BLOB, depending the size of data you expect to store: TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, and LONGBLOB.<br>  <br>  Most other modern relational databases support BLOBs too.|`|MD1kbWOXaa	Hi<br>  Blob is the format to which the picture is used to be saved in the database so that u can store the image over the data base.<br>  <br>  But retrieval is pretty tougher pa.

azaMkJijaa	Nope. If it was that easy, then no one would need RAM. All the paging file does is make a small portion of the harddrive read and write data randomly without saving it.

sZ7QCJ8laa	A program named "waterfalls.scr" serves as a simple example of a Trojan horse.<br>  <br>  The author claims it is a free waterfall screen saver. When running, it instead unloads hidden programs, scripts, or any number of commands without the user's knowledge or consent. Malicious trojan horse programs conceal and drop a malicious payload on an affected computer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without the permission or knowledge of the user. The term "virus" is also commonly but erroneously used to refer to other types of malware, adware and spyware programs that do not have the reproductive ability. A true virus can only spread from one computer to another (in some form of executable code) when its host is taken to the target computer; for instance because a user sent it over a network or the Internet, or carried it on a removable medium such as a floppy disk, CD, DVD, or USB drive. Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by another computer.[1][2]<br>  <br>  Viruses are sometimes confused with computer worms and Trojan horses, which are technically different. A worm can use security vulnerabilities to spread itself to other computers without needing to be transferred as part of a host, and a Trojan horse is a program that appears harmless but has a hidden agenda. Worms and Trojans, like viruses, may cause harm to either a computer system's hosted data, functional performance, or networking throughput, when they are executed. Some viruses and other malware have symptoms noticeable to the computer user, but most are surreptitious. This makes it hard for the average user to notice, find and disable and is why specialist anti-virus programs are now commonplace.<br>  <br>  Most personal computers are now connected to the Internet and to local area networks, facilitating the spread of malicious code. Today's viruses may also take advantage of network services such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, Instant Messaging and file sharing systems to spread, blurring the line between viruses and worms. Furthermore, some sources use an alternative terminology in which a virus is any form of self-replicating malware.|`|1fgMq7o7aa	1. A computer virus attaches itself to a program or file enabling it to spread from one computer to another, leaving infections as it travels.<br>  <br>  2. A worm is similar to a virus by design and is considered to be a sub-class of a virus. Worms spread from computer to computer, but unlike a virus, it has the capability to travel without any human action. A worm takes advantage of file or information transport features on your system, which is what allows it to travel unaided.<br>  <br>  3.The Trojan Horse, at first glance will appear to be useful software but will actually do damage once installed or run on your computer. When a Trojan is activated on your computer, the results can vary.|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	Check out the following article its very informative enjoy.|`|GxXpvNIwaa	A Trojan virus is faulty computer program that can infect remote computers by changing the desktop or deleting important files.

joZFuLEwaa	Hi Tia<br>  <br>  I had the same problem with my Dell battery.  If your computer is still under warranty call Dell right away as they will replace the battery at no charge.  Call Dell right away anyways to see if they will assist you as there was a recall on alot of Dell batteries and the one you have might be one of them. Don't waste any time call fast though.<br>  <br>  If you do need to purchase another one and are not covered under the warranty do not purchase directly through Dell as they are too expensive.  You can find batteries for alot less online if you do a search for your specific type of battery.  let me know if you need help.|`|H6LMmswaaa	Your battery may have a 4 cell or a 6 cell. But, with what you typed, i believe it's a 4 cell... my parents have the same problem. If you have a dell, look for ways to conserve your battery power. For example, DON'T play music too loud while not being charged. or DON'T have the screen light has bright as it can be. All these ways can help. But, if your working on your PC, please have it plugged in while your working on it.|`|Ki5xSgmGaa	In a few weeks you won't be able to charge the battery.  Either get a new battery or use the outlet power cord. New batteries are about 300 dollars.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Well, not really, if the battery is old and had been recharged a lot. Lithium Ion batteries don't last forever, so Dell apparently has some hardware that monitors the life of the battery and warns you when it's close to end-of-life.<br>  <br>  Now, you may be right that the battery is still good, if the hardware is basing the message on number of charges or just age.<br>  <br>  You might want to calibrate the battery. Run the laptop all the way down on the battery until it will no longer stay on. This won't completely drain it (Li-On batteries usually hold a small 1-2% charge in reserve), but the laptop knows that there isn't enough power in there to stay on.<br>  <br>  Now, plug in the charger (overnight or while you're out for the day is best) and leave the laptop turned off. Leave it on the charger a bit longer than usual...maybe an hour or two. <br>  <br>  This will calibrate the battery to a full charge. There is usually a small chip in Li-On batteries that manage the charge and capacity...they have to be occasionally refreshed. <br>  <br>  In fact, I've seen advice to do this twice in a row: drain, charge, drain again, charge. This is usually good for new batteries.<br>  <br>  This is something that needs to be done every 30-40 charging cycles with Li-On batteries.<br>  <br>  Draining will also give you a good idea of the battery's condition. If it dies after a short time, even after a drain and charge, it might be time for a replacement.<br>  <br>  And you don't have to buy a new battery from Dell. there are tons of OEM batteries available on line (especially on ebay), which work just fine. They can be a lot cheaper, too.<br>  <br>  Note: I don't know what country the person above me lives in, but you can buy an entire refurbished laptop for $300. I just bought an 8800mA, 12-cell battery (good for about 7 hours) for my two year old HP laptop, on eBay, for $65 brand new.<br>  <br>  $300...please.
AA11284831	Switch your systems to use OpenDNS instead of your service provider's DNS service.  OpenDNS allows you to control what people can access on the Internet without having to purchase any 3rd party software or pay any fees.  Go here for more information:  <a href="http://www.opendns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.opendns.com</a><br>  <br>  It's fairly simple to set up an account and switch over to OpenDNS.  Complete instructions are on the site.  The only thing that might need to be installed is their dynamic client if your Internet connection uses dynamic addressing.  If you have a static IP address on your network that won't be necessary.<br>  <br>  Once you've made the switch, you can control what types of content is reachable by your users.  Any attempts to reach banned content will display a warning message on their screens.  You can also ban or allow specific sites by URL.<br>  <br>  One important caveat is in order.  There is no "magic electronic bullet" that will absolutely prevent slackers from avoiding work.  If you block Internet access they will find other ways to waste your time and resources, whether it's playing solitaire on their computer or running the craps game in the back of the warehouse.  <br>  <br>  You deal with the issue by using standard proven management practices.  Be aware of what people are doing.  Ensure that everyone has enough work to keep them busy.  Accept no excuses for failure to deliver work on time and up to quality standards.  You don't have to be a beast or oppressive task-master to achieve this but keep expectations high and good workers will live up to them and exceed them.  The slackers will be immediately apparent and can then be dealt with appropriately, i.e counsel them on the expectations of the job and the consequences of failure to meet expectations.|`|9a116df579a24375d34007ea3f0af799aa	Step 1: Simply tell them the company policy and the penalties for transgression.

You have to host your website with a hosting company and they charge a monthly fee for that. Some can be very cheap, but then you have to design everything yourself, and you will not get very many features, designs, email addresses etc. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. You can get full featured websites, nice designs, lots of email addresses and user-friendly content management systems for under $15 per month. Don't agree to pay more than that.
NpZukuuraa	The Windows registry is a central database that stored all the necessary information required to configure a computer's system for its users, applications and hardware devices.<br>  <br>  It is a directory that stores all the settings and the options for the Microsoft Windows operating system, including all of your computer's hardware, OS software, preferences setting, users, etc. All the changes will be reflected and stored in the windows registry whenever you make changes to your control panel settings, installed or installed software, etc.<br>  <br>  The most common way to view, open and edit Windows Registry is by using Registry Editor.<br>  ? Go to start menu - run.<br>  ? Type regedit once the run window is opened and the Registry Editor window will appear.<br>  <br>  It could also be accessible from the Windows folder by the file name regedit.exe.<br>  <br>  There are also some other ways to edit Windows Registry but using Registry Editor is the easiest way especially for beginners. If you open the Registry Editor window, you'll see that it is separated into two parts which function almost the same as Windows Explorer. The left part is the registry path just like the folder path in Windows Explorer. The right part is the registry keys related to the registry path.<br>  <br>  Windows Registry is divided into five main parts (plus one main hidden part which is only for advanced user). Those five parts can be seen and viewed from the left window (registry path). The description of each part is as follows:<br>  <br>  1. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT<br>  This is the first branch. It is a file that associates mappings to support the drag and drop feature, OLE information, Windows shortcuts, and the Windows user interface. It also contains information about registered programs, file associations, and other basic Windows information.<br>  <br>  2. HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br>  This part contains specific information about logged-in user.<br>  <br>  3. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br>  This part contains general information about hardware and software for all users such as the type of hardware, software's setting and other preferences on the computer.<br>  <br>  4. HKEY_USERS<br>  This part contains specific information about users setting (as in desktop configuration for each user) for every user in that computer. This part is the subpart of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER.<br>  <br>  5. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG<br>  This part contains hardware configurations and other information gathered at runtime.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember is that you must be extra careful when editing Windows Registry. Creating backup of it before making any changes should be your first priority. <br>  <br>  Common issues that indicate a need for windows registry repair include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  You are having slow computer problems.<br>  Anti-virus and spyware software didn't repair the issues.<br>  There are crashes and continuous computer freezes.<br>  The computer starts slow.<br>  Rebooting the computer is becoming a consistent problem.<br>  Errors specifically pinpoint a problem.<br>  There is an inability to properly add and remove software on PC.<br>  There is the "Blue Screen of Death.".<br>  The computer is experiencing lengthened response times.<br>  Computer internet is slow.<br>  Program launches are delayed.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	The Windows Registry is a database which stores settings and options for Microsoft Windows operating systems.

BGjNqDloaa	laptops are built to withstand high levels of heat since the crammed space all the components are shoved into have such inadequte cooling. most mainstream video cards have a meltdown/damage point of 91c. if your video card reaches 88c they are programmed to immediately stutter or raise fan speeds in order to cool, and then shut down if that fails. GPUs run extremely hot even when not under a workload. my main GPU in my desktop runs about 55c idle (with extremely cooling) and 80c at full workload, and my desktop has 8 fans in it and some of the best cooling systems in it. your GPU, or another component will for sure shut down the computer long before it takes damage. just dont overclock it! overclocking any component in a laptop overrides the initial safety measures built into the computers chips which maintains its ability to shut down during any kind of extreme temperature problem. if it is not overclocked than you are fine and it will maintain itself. many gaming laptops have GPUs that stay around a good 80c, so your not too bad.

beQolBQJaa	Artiechoke, I haven't used this feature but when you delete something from your computer, let's say a picture, what's erased is the address or direction of the file, the picture is still in you computer but the location in the hard drive is open to receive (write) new information on it, when your system writes something in that location is when the picture is really deleted.<br>  This feature will wipe the data that is still kept on that space that you think is 'free'. This is how data recovery programs can get back your data.<br>  Regards!|`|bcJKs6ycaa	This is to do with the way windows deletes files. In a nutshell it doesn't delete files, it only says to the system that the file (or its space) you wanted to delete can be overwritten, therefore adding to your free space but the file remains on your hard drive invisible until being overwritten. this means that there is a chance the files can be found again, providing windows hasn't used that space for saving something yet.<br>  <br>  The wipe free space option creates a huge file that takes up all your space, then it deletes thishuge file, in turn overwriting all deleted information so it is, in theory, unrecoverable. <br>  <br>  Overall a more secure way of ensuring that files you have delelted cant be recovered (although not 100% secure)

Ive had way too many guys try and sell me stuff either that I did not need or things they had no idea about.  For the most part they will tell you whatever you want to hear in order to make a sale.  Very few will give you truly honest advice based on your needs.  <br>  <br>  Independent shops are the way to go!
044IeGstaa	Did you recently install this Biostar mobo into a computer case?<br>  <br>  1.Inside the computer case is a Support Plate. Sometimes they are separate from the case itself, sometimes they are riveted right to the case.<br>  The Support Plate has Standoff's on it. These are brass metal spacers.<br>  Hex shaped like a stop sign looking down at the top of them. Threads on the bottom end to screw into the support plate, and a hole with threads on the other end, to install the motherboard mounting hole screw.<br>  <br>  They MUST be positioned, to match up to the motherboard mounting holes! IF you have ONE standoff not matched up to a mobo, (Motherboard), mounting hole, it will touch the bottom of the mobo.<br>  The mobo has exposed solder joints on the bottom. If the standoff touches these, it can Short Out the mobo!<br>  <br>  MOST of the time, you can just take the mobo out, remove, or match up the standoff, and reinstall the mobo. No harm, no foul.<br>  <br>  Not the problem?<br>  <br>  2.Take a look at the Electrolytic Capacitors on the mobo. They look like this,<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capacitors_electrolytic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capaci...</a><br>  (Bottom one in the photo. It's laying on it's side. Stand it up)<br>  <br>  If a capacitor, or capacitors, have the top/s 'pooching' up, they are bad.<br>  They will have an X, or a lK on top.

But not that bad, if just one goes out. (Of course if one goes out, more are sure to follow suit)<br>  <br>  'Caps' around the processor ARE bad news if just ONE goes bad!<br>  These Electrolytic Capacitors, are used as Voltage Regulators for the processor. <br>  The processor needs a steady, 'clean', supply of DC voltage. Processors have a Very TIGHT tolerance, and the voltage values for it CANNOT vary by much.<br>  That's why that guy in the vid (No.3 link), is having a bad time.<br>  <br>  3.What do you mean by "reset power source"?<br>  You have tried another power supply?<br>  Maybe it's bad too!<br>  Capacitors go bad in Psu's just like they do on motherboard's.<br>  (See No.1 and 2 above)|`|0XVLsJTLaa	how old is it if its new go and extange if u can.

There you go!

KLblWIhuaa	There are several software packages available that will allow you to clone a disk from one computer to another (such as Norton Ghost, and Acronis TrueImage), in the correct circumstances it makes it very easy to take an image from one disk, and apply it to another, but I don't think it would be this simple in your case.<br>  <br>  Cloning only tends to work well when the cloned disk will be used on very similar hardware. Your new computer won't have the same hardware as the original one, so there will be problems with the drivers on the disk not matching and needing to be reinstalled for the new hardware, if the machine boots at all, I have also come across situations where the cloned disk won't boot at all in the new machine due to the new hardware requiring a different HAL to the original.<br>  <br>  The process of cloning the disk is non-destructive, so why not give it a go, fire up the new disk in the new machine and see what happens. You still have all of your data on the old disk if it doesn't work, so you don't have a lot to lose other than your spare time.|`|laofAjTAaa	copying an OS install onto another computer will probably not work as there will be too many differences in terms or hardware, but if you want to try this - use an application such as norton ghost, setup the hard drive as a slave boot from the norton cd and ghost the old hard drive onto the new - put into your new computer and see what happens, if it fails to boot try running a repair from the windows cd over the installation. - www.computer-adviser.com/xp-repair.html|`|3vwvLWrHaa	Add the drive as a slave (secondary drive) an d then copy the files you want, You cannot transfer the OS though, The OS is configured for the Mother Board and system it was installed on, there is no way to change the install data the OS created.

For example, if the system wishes to model a car, the object used will be a car object that simulates a real life car.  It would thus have attributes such as color, make, model, mileage, price, etc.  It would have functions such as accelerate, brake, steer, etc.

(I lived on my neighbor's rooter for the first few days.)<br>  It will download Open Office without problem, which is free by the way.<br>  It has a quality feeling to it and I'm sure it's well built.<br>  Some people here don't like netbooks because they're used to bigger computers but if you're not plannig to put a rocket in space this a good mini computer. <br>  I have the 9'' screen.

xh5hyLXJaa	For many years now, I have had my computer connected to my television and stereo so that I can watch films from my computer, sitting comfortably on my couch, or to set the mood with winamp visualisations and music when people are coming around. I have not seen many home setups which take advantage of this. It is so much nicer hearing your MP3 collection, pumping out the big speakers in your house.<br>  <br>  It is very easy to set up and it can be done very cheaply, and in some cases free. The cost comes in with cables and adaptors which are cheap unless you need to buy an extra component. It should be possible for everyone to acheive for well under 800 Rs/-.<br>  <br>  This article will show you how to connect your computer to your television and stereo. We will cover lots of different scenarios so I hope by the end of this article, everyone will have successfully been able to acheive this.<br>  <br>  This theory is identical to if you want to hook your computer up to a projector so if that is what you use, this article is also appropriate for you.<br>  <br>  What you need:<br>  <br>  This is hard to define initially in this article as there are so many ways to achieve this depending on what type of television you have and what video outputs your computer offers. You may also find that you only want to attach the stereo, and leave the TV disconnected, or vice versa. That is fine, just find the relevant parts of this article to suite your needs. For now we will keep it very basic.<br>  <br>      * A Computer, desktops and laptops will both work. You will require a spare output from your video card.<br>      * A Television with some type of AUX input.<br>      * A Stereo with some type of AUX input.<br>  <br>  AUX stands for Auxilery, which means an input from an external source. Most stereos and televisions will have these as they are what you would use to connect your DVD or VCR to it.<br>  <br>  How to connect your video source to your television:<br>  <br>  We are going to look at video first because there are a lot of options here. Connecting your computers audio to your stereo is a much easier task.<br>  <br>  The quality you will receive from this setup will depend greatly on the television itself. You may find that reading text and desktop icons are very difficult with the analog options below, but even with an old television, you will be able to watch movies which are on your computer on your TV. They will be of similar quality to connecting your DVD or VCR to your television.<br>  <br>  Define your televisions AUX input type:<br>  <br>  We first need to define what inputs you have on your television. Some will work better than others. The newer and more expensive televisions are likely to get better results. We will start with the best and work our way through. It is best to keep the format the same at both the output of the computer and the input of the television, meaning that we don’t want to convert from Component Video to S-Video connections where possible.<br>  <br>  The Digital World:<br>  <br>  HDMI InterfaceHDMI - High Definition Multimedia Interface: Ideally we will all have an HDMI connection on both our television and video card, but most likely don’t have it on either. Many new LCD screen and Plasma displays offer this mother of connections. They are also becoming a little more popular on Video cards. This will give you the highest quality signal. This format can also carry audio. This is very easy to connect from one device to another. It offers the same video quality as a DVI.<br>  <br>  DVIDVI – Digital Visual Interface: Many current computers will offer this connection out of the video card. You may well find that if you have a plasma or LCD television, this will be the best connection to use.<br>  <br>  The Analog World:<br>  <br>  VgaVGA/XGA – Video Graphics Array: This is the standard video output you would have from your video card in your computer. There are not many televisions with these inputs on them. I specifically bought a CRT television with this port many years ago as LCD and plasma displays were very expensive at the time. It offers a good quality picture but is limited on my TV to 640×480 resolution. Text is readable and movies look great. This VGA resolution is higher than what most CRT screens can handle.<br>  <br>  SvideoS-Video &ndash Separate Video: This is common on Video cards and televisions. With this format, you will have difficulty reading text on the screen, but films and games will be fine. This is the same output many DVD/HD-TV boxes/Gaming consoles offer so you can expect the same quality as that. Many video cards have this connection.<br>  <br>  RCA - CompositeComposite Video – RCA connector: Last and definitely least is the trusty RCA connector. This is what we have used for many years to connect audio and video components together. This is of a lower quality than S-Video but it is still fine for sending audio and video signals around the place. You are most likely to have this connection on your TV and it is possible that you have this on your video card also.<br>  <br>  How to decide which connection to use?:|`|GdSuSweqaa	You would only be setting up the TV to behave as a larger/second monitor only. You need a piece of conversion software and a cable to do so, as well as ensure that your television is compatible. I would ask Geek Squad or someone with experience. I know my laptop has it, but I've never used it before. It's has NOTHING to do with your television or the remote.|`|NEkssyeAaa	Go your control panel or device manager, find the hardware with the icon with a question mark. If it is not there refresh your device manager or add new hard ware.<br>  <br>  Once you find make.model, note it down, then google it or go on the mains site to downlaod latest software or latest drivers.|`|Qr9Ecqgbaa	Well it's not TV as in TV, but there's a free program to watch free T.V.<br>  You'll need internet, it works pretty well.

Is it satellite (DVB-S)?  Terrestrial (UHF)?  Digital Terrestrial (DVB-T)?  I'm guessing DVB-T.<br>  <br>  To use it, you'll need a DVB program.  There might be one installed, called WinTV or something like that.  Just look around your start menu button (under all programs) and see what's there.  You can download programs like DVB Dream for it, but make sure you have a driver installed first.  Should be, if the computer was setup properly for you in the store.|`|QxERY26Laa	Go to start then all programs and search for windows media center or look for a tv tuner software if you do not have either than you can download tv tuner software at the link.

AA10954273	Maybe.  This won't work if it's a restore disc, it will only work if it's a full copy of XP.  You'll also need a second key to activate it on the desktop, so you might as well just buy a new install disc.  You'll need to find and burn XP drivers for all of the hardware in the desktop before you start - XP is too old to support a lot of modern hardware.  You'll also have to format the drive, which means you will completely wipe it out and lose everything, so back it up first.|`|J5dEB9U2aa	Yes It Is !|`|8ca8be7f4582c735baa8ec960d2230c0aa	The answer to this question as asked is:<br>  <br>  No. <br>  <br>  "You may install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Product on a single computer,<br>  such as a workstation, terminal or other device (“Workstation Computer”).

You can treat them as generic functions meant to cast from one type to another:<br>  <br>  static_cast<T>(expr)<br>  const_cast<T>(expr)<br>  dynamic_cast<T>(expr)<br>  reinterpret_cast<T>(expr)<br>  <br>  where "expr" will yield some type X which needs to be converted into type "T." So, some typical uses are:<br>  <br>  1) static_cast<T>(...)<br>  Used for normal conversion between types, so instead of this C-style cast:<br>  int a, b;<br>  double c = (double)a / b;<br>  <br>  You do:<br>  double c = static_cast<double>(a) / b;<br>  <br>  And this also applies when casting user-defined types, pointers and references. static_cast relies on compile time information, so if you want to learn more, read up on casting when applied to derived classes.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) const_cast<T>(...)<br>  To remove const-ness when casting between same type T, e.g.:<br>  <br>  const T& t1 = ...; //t1 = const pointer (i.e. a ref) to a const obj of type T<br>  T& t2 = const_cast<T&>(t1);  //t2 = const pointer to an obj of type T<br>  <br>  Also used to remove volatile-ness information, so if you want to know more...<br>  <br>  <br>  3) dynamic_cast<T>(...)<br>  Allows you to do safe conversion between types within a class hierarchy (derived classes / polymorphic case). It uses Run-Time-Type-Identification (RTTI) to ensure that a valid cast is made.<br>  <br>  See the example here: <a href="http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/keywords/dynamic_cast" rel="nofollow">http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/keyword...</a><br>  (You can treat keyword struct and class as the same)<br>  <br>  <br>  4) reinterpret_cast<T>(...)<br>  By now, you know a lot about cast so I can just say that reinterpret_cast is used when converting between unrelated types.

XmnVJxzaaa	Despite searching for a good 20 minutes, I was not able to find the dimension anywhere. I checked a similar small form-factor case from In-Win and had the dimensions within 10 minutes. I guess HP just wants to keep that information a secret.<br>  I was able to find the HP part number for the power supply: 5188-7520. From that I was able to find out that the part was more than likely made by a company called Delta Electronics, Inc. and their internal part number for it is DPS-160QB A. You'd think the Delta Electronics website would have the information, but they don't either.<br>  So, why am I answering without the information you asked for? Because I found what seems to be a goldmine of information about the line of HP small form-factor computers like yours.<br>  <a href="http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1224011" rel="nofollow">http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?...</a><br>  This link is to the first page of a thread that runs for 128 pages so far and over the past year and a half. It covers the earliest computers offered in your case all the way to your model (which is mentioned somewhere around page 100 - give or take 10 pages - ) and even covers the newest models. I read through about 30 of the pages trying to find your answer. No luck.<br>  BUT one the very first page is a description of the series of computers. What is even better is that there is a list of parts that are recommended by other owners as either being directly compatible, or compatible with some modification. And  somewhere among the pages are suggestions on how to do those modifications. <br>  The moderator of the thread has claimed to be constantly updating the first page with solutions and information owners have found to various issues. The Delta Electronics part number is mentioned on around page 100, so I read the pages around that. What listed that far in is also on the first page. Have fun with the info. Oh, and it does suggest three more powerful power supplies that will work with some modification. <br>  I hope this helps. Again, sorry I wasn't exactly able to answer your question.

They all define 1 gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 bytes instead of the 1 gigabyte = 1,073,741,824 bytes which it *really* is.<br>  <br>  This is called "binary" vs "decimal" sizes. If you look at the *fine print* you will always see "[Company X] defines 1 gigabyte as 1 billion bytes". This is standard industry practice, unfortunately were a drive manufacturer (Western Digital for example) to be *honest* about this then their drives as advertised would all appear smaller than the competitors, when in fact they would not be. Shoppers would be comparing "apples to oranges" rather than "apples to apples".|`|scOcY1tMaa	Bytes are based on the binary system of numbering<br>  EX:<br>  1111-1111 (8 bits) = (from right to left) 0,1,2,4-8,16,32,64<br>  When added up this equals 64+32+16+8+4+2+1+0 = 127 (when rounded off = 128).<br>  therefore 1111-1111-1111-1111(16 bits) = (from right to left) 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048...<br>  When added up this equals 32,767 (rounded off to 33,000)<br>  32 bits are rounded off to make an even larger disparity with decimal numbers.<br>  64 bits are even more humongeser (?) huger, real big.<br>  128 bits are like outa here (way off).<br>  512 bits and I'm lost.<br>  1024 bits and you're gettin' the pitcher (picture) - I dunno no more.<br>  2048 bits and I'm outta here.<br>  ;-)|`|MD1kbWOXaa	Hi<br>  The 4gb will be left as a blank space only.<br>  <br>  This capacity is needed because in copying a hard disk completely is needed termed as ghosting.<br>  so that data from a hard disk will be termed to be stay over that and transfered.<br>  <br>  And the memory is also termed as virtual memory.|`|c8EURCYnaa	A gb is actually 1024 mb but drive manufacturers always tell you that they use 1000 mb as a gb thus taking 24 mb from every gb.

YOU CANNOT ADD THEIR DNS SERVERS TO YOUR ROUTER MANUALLY AS THEY WILL CHANGE OVER TIME!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  But if you are set on getting the addresses. You need to plug your computer directly into your modem. Then you need to restart your modem and computer. When you log in go to Start>run> type cmd and hit enter. Once your at the command prompt type ipconfig /all and look for the DNS servers. I've done it many times before and i know it will work.|`|NkHU8tEJaa	Call your ISP, they should have that information.|`|Xi8LpZC0aa	Contact your ISP  and ask them for the information!|`|evZGc4wyaa	Open a command prompt (Start --> Run --> "cmd" and hit enter) and type "ipconfig /all" and you will get all the info for your Ip address (IP, Subnet, etc).

be55f04b8c79c46e08a6dcc1d71b8bd5aa	Chances are, there's an option somewhere on the camera itself that lets you erase the contents of the card. If you prefer to do it on your Mac, though, perhaps Disk Utility (located in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder) would do the trick. Once you've selected the card in the list of volumes along the left, the right-hand pane should have a tab called "Erase". This tab contains the stuff you'll need to erase pretty much any storage device. Just make sure to use the same file system it had before, or the camera may not be able to use it properly. Hope that helps!

xVfjkTyuaa	Not sure what you are asking for. Do you want a router that can control how much data is downloaded (per day or per month?), or are you asking for something that controls how much bandwidth is allowed for download?<br>  In either case, most home routers do not have this capability. You may have to look at some Linux-based router software (on a separate PC) to control these parameters. There are a lot of free firewall/router software packages out there. There may also be something like add-ons for your PC as well, but that may not be enough for you if you have more than one machine sharing the network.

S76Zjopoaa	My first question is did you install new hardware of software.  If you installed new hardware there maybe a conflict of it is not working properly. Take out the new hardware and reboot. If not, unhook all unnecessary hardware i.e. speakers and usb, networking etc... and reboot. If it boots there is a hardware issue.  Add all hardware again only do it 1 at a time booting each time until you have the same issue and when you do this hardware is the culprit.  To check to see if it is you cd-rom drive put your xp cd rom in the drive and see if it boots (you do not need to re-install).  If the computer boots your cd-rom is good.  The next step is to check you memory and hard drive for failure.  for your memory use memtest at the web site provided below.  It is a bootable iso image for download that will check your memory.  There is a utility called seatools - link provided below.  It is a bootable set of utilities that can assist you further with you hard drive.  I had a similiar problem with my dell and the cd-rom drive was the culprit.  follow these instructions starting with the easiest first which is unhooking all periphils and adding them one at a time.  I hope this helps.  The reason you are not getting into windows is because you are not passing the post.  See the web for information on passing the post test before entering windows.  If you don't pass the post windows doesn't boot because it has something to do with a hardware issue.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Press F10 when it's booting (still in black screen) and enter safe mode with networking.  Run a virus scan in safe mode.  If no virus found you'll have to put your XP disk in the cd drive and boot off of it.  It will ask you if you want to repair the install.  Run the repair option.  (btw, backup all of your important files first)|`|RngUbYHfaa	Sounds like your hard drive crashed buddy.<br>  <br>  Tough luck.

OBemKKwoaa	Depends on the laptop, the settings u are running, and the battery u have. I have the typical 4 cell battery running a dell inpiron and on power saving settings, it gives about 3 hours from a full charge|`|8MwF3NNVaa	Probably in the range of 2 to 4 hours, but I don't think there's a meaningful pat answer for that. <br>  <br>  It's all about the capacity of your battery, its condition, how new it is, the load of your system and how much you use it.  And next month the answer would likely be different anyway, as batteries tend to hold up less and less over time.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do aside from looking at what the manufacturer 'says' is the rated time is to give it a full charge and time it yourself to find out how long it lasts for you.<br>  <br>  You should also follow the guidelines for battery maintenance that Dell says.  Depending on the battery you should periodically run it fully down before recharging.|`|oRCKXRgUaa	What Model?

e5885b25c00e9b8109c2ca7925fa0a5eaa	Processor: if you really want to amp up your gaming abilities, check out quad cores, like the AMD Phenom.  I just got a 2.3 GHz quadcore Phenom for $80, but it was on sale (normal price is $160-$180).  Now the Phenom x4 uses AM2+ while your current CPU uses AM2, but they pretty much use the same socket.<br>  <br>  RAM: Your machine can only hold up to 4 GB of DDR2.  If you are looking to max it out, get 4 GB of 1066 MHz, which might require 4 new sticks of RAM.  If you don't want to shell that money out, then make sure you get the exact same type of RAM as your other 3 sticks; a convoy can only move as fast as it's slowest ship.<br>  <br>  HDD: 4 TB is beyond excessive.  What you really need is a good 300-500 GB HDD that runs at a minimum of 7200 RPM, 3 GB/s.  If you really want to fork out the dough, the Velociraptor is amazing, but over $200.<br>  <br>  Graphics Card: bump yours up to at least a 512.  You can get the GeForce 8500GT for less than $40, and it's better than the stock you have.  It takes PCIe 2.0, which your system has one available slot.<br>  <br>  Monitor: Last thing to upgrade.  You will want one with a good contrast ratio and response time.  Usually, you're looking at $150 for a 20+" LCD flat panel.<br>  <br>  edit: and yes, he's right.  Upgrading certain pieces of equipment (mainly graphics card) will require more power.  Make sure you have a strong enough PSU before upgrading the video card.|`|b8VRlStoaa	I think upgrading your video card would probably require upgrading your power supply, at best you have a 250W maybe less. You will need atleast a 350W to make a graphics card upgrade worth it and you will definatly want a better monitor to improve your gaming quality. maxing out the ram never hurts. Price out some upgrades but you may want to just upgrade the whole tower.

UF8qU5cGaa	Yes, and no. In theory Mac OS X will work on many PC systems. The problem is that the retail Mac OS DVD is not designed for use on normal PCs, you can however get a doctored version of the installation media.<br>  <br>  There is a whole community dedicated to so called "Hackintoshes" at InsanelyMac (OSx86). They have recipes on how to install Mac OS.<br>  <br>  Windows XP does not define your target PC very well, XP runs on a lot of new and old hardware. Mac OS requires SSE to work nicely. It's usually not a problem. There are however lots of issues with hardware drivers, after all Apple only supports their own hardware.

Otherwise select personalize. From there select display settings. From there select Advanced. In here the should be a tab relating to your graphics card.

Many free hosts require their company name to be added to your URL as a sub domain, (e.g. my site.their sub domain.com) and you may have to add one of their ads (link or banner) to your site. <br>  <br>  You could start with a blog as well, e.g. try the Google’s blogger or the advanced Wordpress (which you can add plugins for enhancement), or use the simple Google Page Creator (soon to be changed to Google Sites - You need a Gmail account) - easy to set up for a beginner. <br>  <br>  There are free (and easy) web site building tools, such as Weebly (Using drag and drop), Snap Pages (Good for sharing photos), and Edicy Pages (Various templates/themes similar to Blogger and Wordpress).<br>  <br>  Later on though, it might pay to learn html/JavaScript/PHP etc, which allows more flexibility to design and modify your web site. Then maybe upgrade to a paid host and domain, which will possibly yield more features (scripting features, higher bandwidth, increased storage space, email accounts, etc) and more ownership of your site...|`|QXZxFI99aa	Ok dude, It really depends on how experienced you are.

It's important to keep backups of your stuff; Macs include a feature called Time Machine to make that easier to do if you have an external hard drive handy. As for crashes, when a program crashes on a Mac, it just crashes. It doesn't make anything else crash or become unstable, the way it does on Windows. It's one of the reasons you can go a LOT longer between reboots on a Mac, or on Linux too for that matter.|`|oRCKXRgUaa	"I know that for a PC, if you don't partition the disk, & put everythin' on the C (system) drive, if it crashes, there's always that chance you'll lose all your files."<br>  <br>  FALSE.<br>  <br>  You can lose data just the same if your hard drive crashes.

A partition does not safe the rest of the drive.  If the drive dies, all partitions and the data on them are lost.<br>  <br>    If you are using Windows, go out a buy backup software and keep our data on backup on a external drive.  If you use a Macintosh, just plug in an external drive and let Leopard (OS 10.5) use that drive for backups using the included Time Machine backup software that you don't have to buy.

Sorry to say but it's time to look at moving to a newer computer if you want speed and want to be safe on the internet too.  <br>  <br>  As for cleaning your computer, you can defrag the hard drive and empty your temp files but still, you have an old computer and a slow internet connection so that probably won't make a noticeable difference.  <br>  <br>  Hope you can get a new computer soon!|`|zGPaH7tjaa	Hi<br>  <br>  You could download a registry cleaner to clean your computer.<br>  As for the internet, you don't want to pay much more for you internet connection.

If that is not an option then you have to clone what is on the drive by placing it in the secondary position as a slave and then boot to it from another OS in the primary position. Even then with a virus on the system all you are doing is cloning the problem and may end up with the bad stuff on the new installation.

RyvKws7Laa	Unfortunately, in short, no.  The iMacs in general are brutally hard to upgrade anything besides the RAM.  Even something as basic as a hard drive is really hard to upgrade after the fact.  This is my biggest gripe with Apple.  That in their mid-range and low-range products you can't do any upgrading on your own.  I could care less about all of the "it just works" or other useless marketing from Sir Steve.  I would much rather just have a $1500 PC I could actually upgrade.  I'm kind of hoping he's forced to retire soon and maybe his replacement will open Macs up a bit.<br>  <br>  There is a small possibility though if you go to an Apple certified technician that they might be willing to pull the thing apart and do it for you.  But its kind of a sketchy process, so I would have large concerns about damage to components of my iMac.|`|5279a2ae6b483d2e0700873d9d4a6b12aa	It may be possible, but it's not cheap or easy. It's not user-replaceable, and it's not an off-the-shelf part like you'd find in a computer store, so you'll have to go to an authorized Apple service provider (but not an Apple store).

Unbeknownst to the recipient, the friend's computer has been infected, and the virus has commandeered their Facebook account. After clicking the link, the user gets a message saying Adobe Flash needs to be updated. Instead of a Flash update, the Koobface virus gets downloaded, and the infection spreads.

If you system becomes unstable, that's where I would start.|`|AA11703028	hi mate<br>             as allready mentioned some psu,s make more noise than others and even branded psu,s can sometimes be louder than budget psu,s for less than ￡20<br>             however the noise from your psu also depends on the amount of power required by the hardware in your p.c,so for example if you have several optical and hard drives and a un-efficent processor then your psu is going to be working harder than if you had a energy efficent core 2 quad processor and sata drive<br>             i used to have a pentium 4 cpu which was hyper threaded and even though it was pretty powerful it would make my hiper 425watt psu sound like a airplane when under load<br>             so what i am getting at is when your pc is booting its not unusual for your psu to be louder during this procedure and then to quieten down around 5 minutes later<br>             you may also want to investigate your pc case and check for any loose screws ect,as this is one of the most common reasons for noise in pc,s,and if required buy some sound-proofing material which can be applied to the inside of your case and this can improve the noise polution from your case<br>             it may be better allround to invest in a more efficent and quieter case,these are not too expensive for example the Cooler Master Centurion 5 Silver( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/SuperSpecials/Other+products/Cooler+Master+Centurion+5+Silver?productId=16357)" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/SuperSpecials/Othe...</a> is a great case for the price and is remarkebly queit aswell,and comes with 2 x fans( 1 x 80mm and 1 x 120mm) which keep all your components nice,n,cool<br>              note: to see if the problem is your psu try removing the psu from the case and run it on its own for around 5 minutes,see how much noise is generated by the psu,as you may find its not your psu but the strain your pc,s components are putting the psu under ,so in this case a new psu would be recommended,however make sure its around 800watt but more importantly make sure the +12v rail(s) are at least 25A and if theres dual +12v rails then at least 18A on each rail<br>                 this is the most common mistake made when buying power supplys,most users pay too much attention to the wattage and allthough this is very important its not the only important factor<br>                the +12v rail is just as important especially when running mid/high end graphic cards as these use alot of juice infact cards such as the 9800gtx+ and gtx260 require a minimum of 25A on the 12v rails and if the psu has not got the required specifications then you may experience system crashes especially when gaming<br>                  any problems let me know<br>                         good luck mate !
zorYTX59aa	HI, ASHLEY. THANK YOU FOR BEING MY 5,000TH ANSWER ON Y!A.<br>  <br>  If you want to be able to see YouTube videos <br>  in HQ or HD, here's the determining 'X' factor:<br>  <br>  1 - if you set your "video playback quality" to<br>  "dynamic", you should automatically see the <br>  option for HQ/HD instantly on your screen (if <br>  the video is indeed HQ enough).<br>  2 - if you set your "VPQ" to "slow", then you<br>  will never be able to see that option;<br>  3 - if you set it to "fast", then any videos that<br>  come on your screen should theoretically be<br>  already in HQ/HD (whenever available). Thus,<br>  you may be watching in HQ/HD without even<br>  knowing it.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, if you are already "signed-in"<br>  to YouTube as you are reading this, you can <br>  actually look at your VPQ settings from right <br>  here within Yahoo!Answers.

2d0f44307c26fa4df286a70acc88ef84aa	Probably a virus infection. My advice is to update your antivirus and then restart your system in Safe Mode. <br>  Safe Mode is a special way for Windows to load when there is a system-critical problem that interferes with the normal operation of Windows. The purpose of Safe Mode is to allow you to troubleshoot Windows and try to determine what is causing it to not function correctly. Once you have corrected the problem, then you can reboot and Windows will load normally.<br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode, as the computer is booting tap the F8 key continuously until you get the startup menu and then choose Safe Mode. When you are in Safe mode let your antivirus run a full scan on your system.

kmTnIuL2aa	Sounds like it might be overheating. Check if the computer is really warm when it turns off, or if the fans are working. If its not that, it might be a virus crashing your hard drive.|`|833be2c78c171fc1ef65da8f01e26078aa	WARNING You are about to permanently damage your system if you keep turning it on. Check the CPU fan (inside the case) if this is not spinning when you power it on, you need to get a new one. The CPU can fry within minutes if it doesn't get proper cooling. <br>  <br>  Symptoms include: blue screens when booting, random crashes while in Windows, slowdowns even when the computer is idle. The most obvious one is the system shutting itself off.<br>  <br>  This is new failsafe that has been incorporated in new motherboards. There is a sensor that will cut power off if the CPU reaches a certain temperature.

Then go into the Music tab on the Touch and choose that playlist for syncing. Easy as that.<br>  <br>  For Video:<br>  It will only sync with videos that are in iTunes. You will have to import the video to iTunes first. Then click on the Video tab on the Touch and simply check the video you want to sync.<br>  <br>  Once you are done, click the Sync button at the bottom right of the iTunes window, sit back and enjoy.

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.<br>  6. Click "OK"|`|mezX9Ao0aa	finallyfast.com lol JK...worst site ever lol<br>  <br>  but u can clear ur temp files (get ccleaner)<br>  <br>  u can upgrade ur ram|`|SQXpjPdkaa	first id clear ur temp(erary) files. just go to tools and delete browsing history and delete all. it builds up and slows down ur comp over time. make sure u have enough ram(random access memory). sometimes ur comp just has slow days so just try restarting also.

vUsVieulaa	A DIV tag is a semantically-null block-level element that's often inserted to help position objects. It may not be the best idea to stick unnecessary DIV tags all over, but there's nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  As far as breaking it up into a header, body, sidebar, and footer... it all depends on the final design you're trying to achieve. Some site designs (like Yahoo Answers) include a header, body, and footer, while others don't.<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't confuse the <head> section, the <h1-h6> (heading) element, and the header of a design.|`|Elobl7qdaa	Dreamweaver as with all Visual Editors do the best they can in coding, but they usually don't do it correctly or over code a page. Make sure you go through DW's Options carefully and read each one. Especially all the formatting options. DW does have a code cleaner utility which works on its own code mess.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that tables are for tabular data layout and not web page layout. Might help to keep DW straight.  LOL<br>  <br>  Glad to know you are at least working along side DW in Code View.<br>  <br>  Ron|`|0HtH3Mxwaa	yes. the div tag was added to center the table. <br>  that's just how dreamweaver works.<br>  the div tag is basically the same thing as the table tag, but it doesnt require the tr and td tags along with it.|`|JWV2J8Gfaa	To start with, why are you using tables? If you are using a later version of DW (newer than 8) then you should be using APdivs. For one if you create a general layout that every page will have identical then that will save lots of loading time. <br>  <br>  For example, the header, footer, left & right sides, navigation bar, and text links at the bottom of the page are elements that are never going to change. There for I create an external style sheet and load them for each new page. Then for the items that are going to change within the design you keep as internal apdivs. This allowing you to easily change them out with a click of a button and on to the next page.<br>  <br>  No professional designer uses tables, for they are extremely outdated and different browsers horribly define the tables areas. With APdiv tags no matter who's computer or how large of screen they are viewing it on, it will automatically adjust for that. (BTW there is a trick to centering APdivs). If you are interested just mail me.
Q2aW0LCTaa	Well if your trying to make your pc run faster, i can suggest a few ways. <br>                                         Defragmentation<br>  The defragmenting program is a vital process of keeping your pc up to speed and run faster. To access this go to start menu> acceseries> system tools > Disk defragmeter.<br>  Just hit defragment and it will analyze your system and defrag it.<br>                                    Disk clean up <br>  Disk clean up is in the same folder as disk defragmenter. Disk clean up is a program that allows you to delete temporary files stored on your computer, like error reporting, temporary internet files, recycle bin deleted files, exc.<br>                                   %temp%<br>  The %temp% files is just some of your temporary internet cookies and files. To acess this list of tempory files you can go to run and type "%temp%" without the punctuation marks obviously. If you cannot find  the run program, fret not tthere are other ways to access this list. For one you can use your MS-DOS (command prompt). Go to start menu> accesories> command prompt and type "start %temp%, this should pull it up. Or if your a lazy person you can hit ctr+alt+del keys to open task manager click the applications tab and hit new task. Then, yup you guessed it, type %temp% into the run dialog box that will appear.<br>  <br>                   Deleting your music files.<br>  Im not to familar with itunes but is im certain you can access your music file locationg by simply right clicking on a song and hit "open file location".

Other files that<br>  are accepted include AVI, MPG, MOV and <br>  WMV (which is Windows Movie Maker).<br>  <br>  Here are my relevant "help" references with <br>  their full URL addresses -- followed by their <br>  direct links:<br>  <br>  Difference between "projects" and "movies"<br>  windows help . microsoft . com / Windows / en - US / Help / 4cad 2674 - 4d43 - 4751 - <br>  9b0d - 3ba8 febd a8d6 1033 . mspx<br>  <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/4cad2674-4d43-4751-9b0d-3ba8febda8d61033.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows...</a><br>  <br>  How to save your video within Windows XP<br>  www . microsoft . com / windows xp / using / movie maker / create / save to pc . mspx<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/create/savetopc.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using...</a><br>  <br>  How to save your video with Windows Vista<br>  windows help . microsoft . com / Windows / en - US / help / 4ea4 b6cd - 0cfe - 4d02 - <br>  8122 - 16c2 8828 cdf2 1033 . mspx # EJ<br>  <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/4ea4b6cd-0cfe-4d02-8122-16c28828cdf21033.mspx#EJ" rel="nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows...</a><br>  <br>  YouTube's ideal video format/compression<br>  www . google . com / support / youtube / bin / answer . py ? hl = en & answer = 91450<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=91450" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...</a><br>  <br>  I hope my answer is what you're looking for.|`|AA11629848	Apparently you been saving it as a Movie Maker Project. When you finish editing the video go to "File" -> "Save as" -> wmv. That's all you need for YouTube to recognize your video.|`|uV1kllrVaa	Make sure the video does not exceed 10 mins and..<br>  <br>  Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...<br>  <br>  Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..<br>  <br>  The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.<br>  <br>  also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.<br>  <br>  --for best editing....<br>  <br>  use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.<br>  <br>  or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....<br>  <br>  this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.<br>  <br>  Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.<br>  <br>  It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.<br>  <br>  It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"<br>  <br>  =============================???

Thousands of views within a few hours... not likely. Give it time.<br>  <br>  Your videos are merely music slideshows using music and images that you obviously didn't create yourself. You can take credit for the titles... but that's about it.<br>  <br>  Don't be surprised if these videos are eventually deleted by YouTube for copyright infringement.

It's somewhat slower than using Spaces, since it involves switching between whole different user accounts on the machine (duh), as opposed to just moving application windows around on the screen, and if you're the only user of your Mac, there's not really much point except for the eye candy. :)<br>  <br>  You can turn on fast user switching in the "Accounts" pane of System Preferences by clicking on "Login Options" over on the left side, clicking the lock icon and entering your password to unlock the preferences, and clicking the "Enable fast user switching" checkbox. A new menu item will appear on the right end of your menu bar which lets you click on other users to switch to them.

Yes you can run Linux on a Mac, <br>  <br>  Mac OS/x can be run on a normal intel pc but that would be illegal as Mac license agreement bands the use of OS/x on other systems, that's the big problem with proprietary operating systems and software, you are legally bound by the license agreement that way you are controlled by the proprietors of the software, you have to do what they tell you to do with your purchase, but some people ignore the licensing rules,

NpZukuuraa	Pc is not maintenance-free devices. It’s not as simple as just power them up and go. Every pc, over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors. <br>  <br>  The registry is a directory of system settings and options. As modifications are made to the pc configuration in the framework of hardware and software additions or upgrades, the registry is altered. Sometimes these alterations may clash with the current system. <br>  <br>  As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing. These issues translate into performance drawback that typically explodes overtime. To avoid the damage, it is necessary to cleanup registry file.<br>  <br>  Manual repair and maintenance of the registry is an extremely complex task that only the most technically inclined should take on or you run the risk of losing critical data and personal information or even worse end up with a computer that doesn't work at all. With the proper software, however, registry repair becomes a relatively stress free task that will improve your PC's performance without going round the twist and losing one's mind.<br>  <br>  Symptoms a pc registry repair is needed<br>  <br>  Performance issues that indicate the need for pc registry repair typically worsen and become more frequent over time. Once a registry repair is applied, however, there is a noticeable improvement in performance.<br>  <br>  Common issues that indicate a need for windows registry repair include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  You are having slow computer problems.<br>  Anti-virus and spyware software didn't repair the issues.<br>  There are crashes and continuous computer freezes.<br>  The computer starts slow.<br>  Rebooting the computer is becoming a consistent problem.<br>  Errors specifically pinpoint a problem.<br>  There is an inability to properly add and remove software on PC.<br>  There is the "Blue Screen of Death.".<br>  The computer is experiencing lengthened response times.<br>  Computer internet is slow.<br>  Program launches are delayed.<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing a good portion of the problems above, there is definitely the need for an XP registry repair. The best registry offers free scans to help you detect the extent of the problems. The source below give you six criteria of a good registry repair software.|`|8YVo2Wogaa	Where did you find instructions to delete System32?<br>  <br>  Yeah, you need to do major repairs and you will need your Windows disk.|`|mezX9Ao0aa	woah woah woah, dont ever touch anything in the  windows folder. u need ur recovery/xp cd to repair ur missing ddls and others  file tyoes|`|18wWz5LHaa	The best thing is to delete anything taking up a lot of memory.<br>  If you use anything such as limewire or frostwire it can slow your pc up my a mega amount so delete these by clicking on "control panel"  then "add or remove programs" if your download games it can also slow down your computer so do the same.<br>  If your computer doesnt work after this reset it to factory settings, this resets your whole computer to wen u first got it but make sure you save everything you want to keep such as pictures onto a memory stick first.|`|duIpmozQaa	Where did you get these cowboy instructions from.

0Jev1hxAaa	Yeah your suffix effects your ranking.  For instance if you were based in the uk and you wanted to sell products only in the uk it would be better to have a .co.uk domain name than a .com. <br>  <br>  Also if you purchased for example yourdomain.com, yourdomain.info and yourdomain.co.uk you should redirect two of the addresses to the remaining address.  So if your preffered address was yourdomain.com then if someone typed in the other addresses into a browser then they will be redirected to the .com address.  This is known as a '301 permanent redirect'.  The reason for this is if you have multiple domains with the same website content then search engines will class it as duplicate content and your ranking will lower.<br>  <br>  Regards<br>  <br>  Web Design Midlands, MCP<br>  <a href="http://www.webdesign-midlands.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.webdesign-midlands.co.uk</a>|`|dn2UCOkqaa	yep|`|4RnZ0jO6aa	It would affect it, but not a lot, go for a .com domain name where its available, but I would also get .info, .net, .org etc and then have all of them redirect to your .com address, this will enhance your page rank also.<br>  <br>  Please refer to it as a 'suffix' not an 'ending'.

Don't spent money trying to upgrade the hardware of your actual laptop, is a waste of time and money. If you want a small laptop (netbook) with really good specs (1gb RAM, 120gb HD), buy an Acer Aspire One. If you want a laptop with a 15 inch screen and 4gb of ram, buy an HP Dv5.

(usually only hard drives and memory (ram) can be upgraded easily IF they are furthermore upgradeable) (but remember laptop parts itself is quite price)<br>  Second: besides upgrading, i would prefer you do buy a new laptop. i would recommend you toshiba laptops because they are very reliable. in fact, i just got a toshiba laptop few days ago and its great so far. it a fast intel core 2 duo 2ghz cpu, 4gb ram which is expandable later to 8gb to boost system performance, 320 gb hard drive space for more programs and files like you stated in your questions. also the design is very pretty in glossy int and exterior. but just the negative thing is the finger smooges on computer and keyboard which doesnt bother me at all. <br>  third: the price was $700 at best buy store and the computer was worth the price.<br>  also, in my own experience, i wouldnt recommend dell due to the fact they dont use good parts. i had a dell desktop while ago and my dad has few dell laptops and the cd drive on laptops makes vibrating noise and is slow when burning media cd's and so forth. I think the batteries arnt good qualities either, in fact my toshiba get 5 1/2 hours or little more depeding on how one uses it.  <br>  lastly, im assuming you;ll be using the laptop for normal use not for games, but games will work decent with todays technology.<br>  hope this helps<br>  also,,,<br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9164101&type=product&id=1218040477834" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a>  (this is the link to my laptops homepage at best buy)|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	Agree with first answer .....a Dell Inspiron 15/17 or a Dell Studio 15/17 (higher specs) will be reliable and in your price range too.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	Because new technogy is exceptionally fast in new pc's, they all become obsolete in about 3 years. My way to fix this is to sell your used pc for about half of what you paid for it, then use the money to buy a new one. Don't spend over 500 dollars for it as it will become obsolete as well and the extra money goes for things you wont use anyway. Your new one should have 1 or 2 gb ram and 60 to 80gb hard drive. It costs more to upgrade than to do it my way.
ffqsWfZtaa	Sounds like its died, however there are a couple of tricks that sometimes help.<br>  <br>  If its under warranty send it back<br>  <br>  Dissconnect any external devices, if its got a removable optical drive then take this out too.<br>  Remove battery<br>  Connect power and try again.<br>  <br>  Sometimes Toshiba batteries get so flat they wont turn on, replace battery, connect power. leave overnight and try again in the morning.<br>  <br>  Could also try removing hard disk - sometimes they go faulty and pull down power for the whole laptop, same thing can happen with a memory stick.

Some answerers here on Yahoo are actually <br>  disguised salespeople trying to "sucker" you into buying their unnecessary software.<br>  <br>  The solution to your problem may depend on what version of<br>  "Flash" you have installed.<br>  <br>  Play a video in regular mode (not full-screen), then right-click <br>  on the actual video itself. From the dropdown menu, click on<br>  "Settings". If you see 5 square icons on the bottom row, you <br>  might be in luck.<br>  <br>  The first 2 icons should both show a computer monitor. Click <br>  on the one that has an "eye" on the bottom of its screen; it's<br>  usually the first icon. You should thus see "Enable hardware <br>  acceleration". If the checkmark box shows "confirmed", click <br>  it off, and then click on "Close".<br>  <br>  Although my advice to you seemingly goes against the basic <br>  principle of "flash", it actually works. Please doublecheck for <br>  yourself by going to Flash's own website -- and then read the <br>  2nd-to-last FAQ near the very bottom. Here is my written-out<br>  version of the full URL reference, followed by its link:<br>  <br>  www.macromedia.com / support / documentation / en / flashplayer / help / help01 . html<br>  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/help01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.macromedia.com/support/docume...</a><br>  <br>  Otherwise, you may have a faulty version of Flash -- probably<br>  one of the newest versions. The only thing that most updates<br>  are good for is introducing all kinds of software and computer <br>  conflicts.

AA10016890	Well you're on the right track, but maybe a little ways off. Yacc will not generate a compiler. Yacc is a parser generator. What it does is take a context-free grammar and produce a program that can parse that grammar. Yacc allows you to plug in your own actions when each terminal or non-terminal is encountered. Typically, the actions taken will be to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST). <br>  <br>  It is incorrect to say that Yacc generates three address code. You'll have to do that by traversing the AST and generating the code that corresponds to nodes in the AST. An example would be if you have a "plus_node" in your AST that looks something like this:<br>  <br>  + --- 1<br>    \___ 2<br>  <br>  When traversing the tree you'll first encounter the plus_node, you'd allocate some space on the stack (I'm ignoring registers for the sake of simplicity). Next you proceed to the first child node, which is one. You generate code that pushes the integer 1 onto the stack. Next you proceed to generate code that pushes 2 onto the stack in a similar way. Now you are at the plus_node and generate code that pops two integers and adds them. Then you generate code to push the result on the stack.<br>  <br>  You should definitely read the Yacc (or Bison) user's manual (which is very good), and I would suggest either getting a good text on the subject (the "Dragon Book" is probably the canonical book on compilers) or taking a class in compilers. It is a really big subject! You're probably safe skipping much of the theory, but it helps to know what's going on when you get all the "shift/reduce" warnings in Yacc.

c3flPHQwaa	Okay, first you should go to a basic 1.0 scrollbar generator such as:<br>  <br>  <br>  www.mycodesplace.com/Generators/Scroll...<br>  <br>  <br>  Once you create the scrollbar colors you want, hit generate and copy the code and paste it into your profile CSS. (The CSS is found by going to the profile tab, clicking customize profile, and then clicking on CSS) Once there, paste the generated code and then paste in the following underneath it:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *{scrollbar-face-color: COLORHERE; scrollbar-shadow-color: COLORHERE; scrollbar-base-color: COLORHERE; scrollbar-3dlight-color: COLORHERE; scrollbar-arrow-color: COLORHERE; scrollbar-highlight-color: COLORHERE;}<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Everywhere the code says "COLORHERE" place the numbers from the code you generated earlier, which should now be located directly above this code.  (The "base-color" may be called track color in the generated code)  Once finsihed, delete the first code you generated and hit publish. This should solve the problem. :-)  Just make sure to copy the entire above code, from star sign to end. And when you insert the color numbers, leave the proper letters/parentheses that are around the generated numbers and leave the space between the : and the rgb(number)   <br>  <br>  For example, when you change-  scrollbar-face-color: COLORHERE;<br>  <br>  It should look something like-   scrollbar-face-color: rgb(247,108,41);  <br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!!!! :-)

It would seem to simplify the logic while still satisfying the recursive design.  The first line always seems to be a single line.  Then you only have to figure out the second line pattern.<br>  <br>  It appears to me that case one is that the line is odd.  If odd, print one asterix and newline.  Then perform the real decision.  Call on the next pair.<br>  <br>  One thing that might help your thinking is to use calls to break the work up.  You then only have to write the logic for the print of a line once.  The person who anwered after me provided a pseudo-code version of this.

CThiAnFlaa	To answer your question it is suggeted to refrain from using word because the saved format can mess up when it is printed (due to printer settings and options, etc.). It is suggested to use Powerpoint (and sometimes PowerPoint and MS word together). For my poster I used powerpoint (and MS word for transporting text). Here is the link to show an example:<br>  <a href="http://i655.photobucket.com/albums/uu280/bonanovas/research%20poster/IPPOSTERpptxPHOTOBUCKET-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i655.photobucket.com/albums/uu280...</a><br>  Specifically, PP will import information from word or other documents, pictures, etc. and transfer/export it to a powerpoint slide (it transfers and codes all the data that you want to include on your poster into itty, bitty text, charts, pictures, etc. of the original data) then you can print out the slide or save it on a memory stick, take the printout or stick to your school library (they should have a printing machine that makes oversized posters...ours does) FedEx or Kinkos if the school does not have one. Therefore, you should use the powerpoint program to make your poster.<br>  BY THE WAY THIS IS MS WORD AND PP IN 2007 EDITION<br>  I am assuming you need this for a research project or some some sort of project that has both research information and graphics (I think you can still apply this to whatever you are doing). So, this is what I did. I opened up my paper document (Word format) and then opened up a new Word document so I could copy and paste the information I needed from my paper into the new MS Word file. I made 6 sections--one new document for each section--(Abstract, Intro, Method, Results, Discussion and References). I saved each new document as the section it was (example, "abstract" for abstract section) then put all 6 documents into a folder on my desktop and labeled it "POSTER" so I could easily access it. I opened up Powerpoint but wanted a blank slide to work with so I went to <NEW SLIDE (top bar--HOME tab<SLIDES<New Slide<Blank slide). Then I wanted to inport sections to include in my poster. So I went to INSERT tab<OBJECT (in "text" box), which activated a pop-up box...I selected the"create from file"option<BROWSE<DESKTOP<POSTER (my folder name)<double clicked "Abstract"< clicked OKAY. Then, it showed up in the PP slide but it was large. SO, I draged/pulled  the lines/border of the box and made a rectangular box (aprx. size about 1.5" x 2"). I left it there(editing came later). I needed the other information so I repeated the steps for each section:<br>  INSERT<OBJECT<BROWSE<POSTER<INTRODUCTI... <OKAY--I formatted box to desired size by pulling the border around the box inward. Once all the information I needed from my paper was in there I was done with importing (if you need a picture go to "insert picture" and it works the same way). I positioned the 6 boxes of information in the order of how I wanted it to look on my poster. Then came the editing (PPoint has some really neat effect options). I go to the "INSERT" tab<SHAPES (in Illustrations box)<RECTANGLE (in "Rectangles" box)<drag cross (+) to desired size for my heading box and typed in the information (one for Title, my name, abstract, intro, meth, results, discussion and references). I positioned the 8 rectangles (title boxes) above the section it belongs to. I changed the color by going to "DESIGN" TAB<COLORS ("Themes" box)<"APEX" (it is a gold color but there are lots of other colors to choose from). That was pretty much it for the information and headings. However, I had some significant relationships in my data results so I made a correlation picture by going to INSERT tab < SMART ART< RELATIONSHIPS <BASIC VENN DIAGRAM (three circles with a dash in the center)< typed in "significant relationship" and "r=.57" in the top circle, "alcohol consumption" in the bottom left circle then "quality of sleep" in the bottom right circle). I pulled in the borders to make it around 2" x 2" , positioned it under the "results" section then changed the effects to make it shiny and pop-out a little bit. To change the transparency I went to:"SMART TOOLS TAB--pink colored tab--< DESIGN--it is also between the"get started" and "format" tabs) then CHANGE COLORS<ACCENT 1<4TH/LAST OPTION. To make it shiny and pop-out, I went to DESIGN (in smart tools) <"SMART ART STYLES" clicked on the down arrow on the right side of the box<3D, first option/graphic. That finalized my poster so I saved it onto my memory stick (PDF file/slide) then printed out a copy (just in case). <br>  I know this is a lot of information but I can't find the direction link I used so I just typed out what I did.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck with your poster:)|`|CtgBMZewaa	you cant...anyway, how WILL A BIG POSTER FIT IN YOUR PRINTER....whoever told you that is a nut|`|Elobl7qdaa	Call a local business like Kinko's and ask what kind of format they require for a poster of that size to be made.

The first thing that comes to mind is: do you actually USE all 1300 of the ones you have now? I used to hoard fonts, too, but I've since realized that I never, ever actually find uses for the vast majority of them. If you're on a Mac, you can use Font Book (in your Applications folder) to disable font families without actually deleting them, which allows you to selectively enable and use the ones you need, as needed, without pummeling your system resources. If you're on Windows, I'm not sure what can be done as I moved well away from it years ago. In any case, though, I'd highly recommend taking a good, hard look at your font management habits. Cheers!
4YJU4fa3aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Your problem can have various reasons behind it. Distance from the Central office (exchange) does makes difference, however Internet service providers nowadays take care of this by not providing connection far off from their CO as it's not worth to lose your brand quality in such competitive market.<br>  Resetting modem may or may not help you in making your connection fast.<br>  As per me, if you have just taken a new connection (less than 30 days) the connection might be in optimization period and it may attain the required speed by the time that 30 days period is over.<br>  I would also suggest you to check your Anti-virus and firewall settings once as they do check the speed sometimes.<br>  You may also check if any electromagnetic device e.g. speakers etc kept along the line or near the modem. disconnect and reconnect all the cables to the modem. If issue doesn't resolves then contact the technical support of your DSL provider as their could be a problem with your line itself which can be rectified by running some diagnostic tests from their end and fixed by an engineer visiting your place.<br>  <br>  Happy internet browsing!!<br>  <br>  Jai Ho!!|`|4RnZ0jO6aa	You are further away from your exchange point, therefore it takes longer for internet traffic to reach you, which will make your speeds slower.

WSwDFwC5aa	It uses a protocol called ARP - Address Resolution Protocol.  Each host on the network holds in its memory a table of associated MAC and IP addresses.  The table is populated with ARP - each time an IP address needs to be reached that isn't in the cache, the host uses ARP to identify the correct MAC address, then puts the association in its table.

If you don't have enough ram the OS uses HD as a temporary location for files.<br>  One disadvantage for the external drive is that it's reading at a low reading/write rate due to USB specifications and a game usually requires a good I/O speed.

KHSOVxViaa	The linked lists will consist of the populated elements of the matrices.  The list items will have to contain the indices, as well as the value.<br>  <br>  If the matrices are A, B, with row/col dimensions cA, rA and cB, rB, then the product matrix C will have cC, rC = rA, cB.  You must ensure the matrices are compatible where cA == rB<br>  <br>  You'll need a method to search for a populated element e.g.<br>  element search(x, y, L) {<br>  size = L.size<br>  found = false<br>  element e = null<br>  for (i = 0; i<size and not found; i++) {<br>  e = L.elementAt(i)  // traverse list, maybe use pointers if available<br>  found = (x == e.x and y == e.y)<br>  }<br>  return e <br>  }<br>  <br>  The main loops:<br>  <br>  for (i=0; i<rA i++) {  // iterate rows of A<br>  for (j=0; j<cB; j++) { // iterate cols of B<br>  sum = 0<br>  for (k=0; k<cA; k++) { // iterate to get value for C<br>  element e1 = search(i, k, A)<br>  element e2 = search(k, j, B)<br>  if (e1 != null and e2 != null) { // if corresponding elements<br>  sum += (e1.val * e2.val)<br>  } <br>  if (sum != 0) {  // create a new element<br>  element e3 = new element<br>  e3.val = sum<br>  e3.x = i<br>  e3.y = j<br>  C.addToList(e3) // add it to the product matrix linked list<br>  }<br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  <br>  I've not checked it, may have messed up the indices a bit, but that's the general idea.<br>  <br>  The loops go through the 'virtual' A and B matrices, searching for non-sparse entries.  If any found, multiply accordingly.   If result non zero, add it to the linked list representing the product matrix.<br>  <br>  There will probably be a more efficient method involving primarily stepping through the lists, and checking to see if each element has a corresponding element to multiply.  However, that will take a bit more work.|`|kWxhWET7aa	The matrix multiplication:<br>  <br>  C = BA<br>  <br>  where<br>  <br>  Cij = SUM BipApj over [1,n]<br>  <br>  In pseudocode, this would be horribly inefficient as:<br>  <br>  function MultiplyMatrices( matrix *C, matrix *A, matrix *B )<br>  {<br>  <br>     int i = 0, j = 0;<br>  <br>     for(i = 0; i < A.rows; i++)<br>     {<br>  <br>     C[i][j] = 0;<br>  <br>     for(j = 0; j < B.cols; j++ )<br>     {<br>  <br>     C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][j] * B[j][i]<br>  <br>     }<br>  <br>     }<br>  <br>  }<br>  <br>  Since you want linked lists, you have to make an array of pointers to matrices and pass them into the mutliplication routine one after the other. Sorry I didn't put the pseudcode for the linked lists in here, but it's not too tricky, if you're a competent. I'm willing to bet you were more interested in the matrix multiplication anyway. But don't hate me if I'm wrong, still the singly linked list chain of pointers will solve your needs. It's pretty simple and can be done with one level of indirection and a single for loop.

maMeeV4caa	Actually, I wouldn't recommend buying chargers from ebay because it can be dangerous. Many of them has lower quality (so that they are extremely cheap) and can break easily. If you are going to buy one on ebay, be sure NOT to buy the universal ones but buy the ones specifically for your laptop.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you buy chargers from Topmic.com if they have your laptop model because they offer life time warranty and free shipping to all laptop chargers for only $58. It is a good mix of price and quality.<br>  <a href="http://www.topmic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.topmic.com/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|X5W7o6tvaa	Yes it is usually safe to use a universal. Targus is a really good brand. But, I would get the model number off of the chewed up one and search THAT on ebay. Tons of people sell them, but you need to look at the item description and make sure that it is a genuine part made by whoever made your laptop. And US SELLERS ONLY. At work, we made the mistake of buying one from Hong Kong and it was not even close to what the description said.
DUDkeRemaa	Well Ati vs Nvidia, it's like a religious war, a choice, a preference. Personally, I've had bad experiences with ATi, however amazing ones with Nvidia. Currently I own the EVGA Geforce GTX260 Superclocked+ Edition, its got 896 mb ram GDDR3, 448bit interface, runs crysis on maximum no aa 1680*1050 resolution, around 30 to 35 fps, sometimes a little lower. (also using 4 gb 800 mhz ram Crucial, and the Intel quad core Q6600 2.4 OC to 3.2)<br>  <br>  However, I've been told the new GTX295 from Nvidia is apparently quite the success, wouldn't mind owning one myself. My friend recently bought a newer ATi, in fact i think it was the 4850 im not too good with ATi anymore, but nonetheless, it was a recent card, and it kept crashing on him.. ATi refused to acknowledge the issue was their Video Card Bios, and once my friend found a 3rd party bios so to speak, he installed into the card, and bam, no more crashes, runs better than before. That being said, I would still prefer Nvidia. but again, personal choices. I've been running the GTX260 for approx 3 months, and haven't had any issues with it. I would highly recommend the new nvidia GTX200 series Cores as a choice for your computer. also, i might add the GTX295, is a dual core card. A lot of people I talked to thought it was the better version of the GTX280, but, infact im certain its just 2 GTX260's slapped together, its got 448 bit interface, meanwhile the gtx280 has 512. Anywho, hope i was of help in choosing a good card, I know from experience it can be quite the task to choose an appropriate card for one's system. With so many options like ram, GPU speed, effective mhz, etc... how can one choose a card in plain sight right? Good Luck in your Search.|`|QEFbiVTgaa	For the price your looking at it is a great card. It competes with the GTX 260, 216 cores which is 30 bucks more. I preffer NVIDA, but that card is a great one!!!

HYedOEbnaa	honestly you have too much protection.  You should only be running 1 anti-virus, 1 spyware/adaware, and then windows firewall.  so with the programs that you have i would only run Avast for Virus, Spybot for your spyware and your good with windows firewall.  windows defender and ad-aware you could get rid of.

Default username and password usually are<br>  Username: admin<br>  Password: password<br>  if it works then fine otherwise you need to check the manual of the router.<br>  Once on the console, you may find a link to access wireless console. click on that option and you would be able to find an option to enable wireless connectivity on the router.<br>  Check that option, save the settings and restart the router.<br>  Hope this works for you....<br>  <br>  Have happy internet browsing!!<br>  <br>  Jai Ho!!

kAi14kKxaa	ActiveX is a browser component that lets the web browser execute programs and manipulate data on your computer.<br>  <br>  When you install an ActiveX object, there is usually a signature (e.g Signed by Microsoft.Inc) that tells you which company made it.<br>  <br>  If you see that the component is made by a company other than Microsoft or a major corp, you should probably not install it.
k1tvepgQaa	only the police would be able to access such information. It can be tracked but unless it's involved in a criminal case, nobody is going to help you.<br>  <br>  The police would have to take the sender's e-mail address and contact the company that owns that e-mail (i.e. yahoo, gmail, hotmail, etc)...they would have to have a subpeona to get that user's account information and to find their IP address, they could then trace the IP back to a specific ISP which would then require another subpeona to get that user's information. The person could be using an anonymous surfing program on their computer which would prevent anyone from tracking them though, so you are out of luck.
