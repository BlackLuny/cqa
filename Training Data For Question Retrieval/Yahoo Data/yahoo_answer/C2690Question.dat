20090222144323AArjUvL	Pets;Dogs	I posted a question yesterday bout my sick dog..i believe she had a stroke, HELP!?	my dog is about 1 1/2 year old..she has the symptoms to a stroke..like tilted head, disoriented eyes, trouble walking, vision problems, open jaw, confusion..but don't think wrong. at first it was only her tilted head.i thought she had been stung by something or just had a pain in the ear, but she was normal other than her head.she could still bark and run,  but yesterday (Feb. 21) she started with her crazy eyes, problems to walk, and confusion etc. the thing is that here where i live there is no VET. the nearest vet is about 50 miles from here. and i am worried she wont make it. i dont have anyone to call for help. the only one is the dog pound, but more than likely they will put her to sleep. the serious symptoms just started yesterday except for her head. anyone know what i can do to help her since i cant take her to a vet???

Is there any waterers that I can put up that will water them that long? I could buy several if they were only 3 gallons or so. What about feeders? That could just supply them with a continuous supply of feed without it getting wet? Or would they over eat and die if i had one? Thanks.

The shelter said she might be an Australian cattle dog mix, which could be true, as some of their physical traits are coming through. We also think she could be a Canaan dog based on her appearance and some of her behavior. Anyone think they might know?      Here are 3 pictures of her:       http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r5/ki...     http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r5/ki...     http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r5/ki...

20090222145606AA7Tzda	Pets;Dogs	How do you get rid of puppy/dog odor? (read details plz)?	My mom complains A LOOOOOOT about there always being a poop smell or wet dog smell ever since we got my puppy 2 weeks ago. We bathed him, hosed down his cage and crate with Pinesol, Mr. Clean, Fabulous, etc., we even mopped the floor, AND disinfected the air with Oust, Febreeze, Glade, etc. but there still seems to be a lingering smell that my mom complains that happens to be "REALLY bad". :o (I don't pay too much mind to the smell because it's not that bad unless he poops in his cage...I mean...he IS a 2 month (Siberian Husky) puppy with no training afterall... >:C )          #1.) So any help or suggestions to stop the smell and keep it at bay?      #2.) Will the smell situation become better as he grows older?          P.S. My dog has been having diarrhea for the past 3 days and he goes to the vet tomorrow (2/23/09) so do you think his farts and illness could be affecting the smell? ;~;

20090222151225AAa40fN	Pets;Dogs	What could have been wrong with him?   Was it his past?  Was he sick?  Was it both?	When I was a kid I had this Shih Tzu.      We got him when he was 7 months old and he was kept in a bathroom for most of his life.   From what I understand someone else who had him....beat  him with a newspaper and a belt.     And a kid had him before and wasn't very nice to him.         Well we got him and he was fine for about 2 years but then one night my mom was laying in bed reading and Pongo was under the bed and she heard him making some whining noise and then she heard a thump and he was shaking.....      He had had a pretty big seizure.    Well in the two years leading up to this he had started having some issues.....mainly agression.   They worked hard with him...read books on training....they never took him to classes though.      He became very agressive toward men and children.    He had another 2 small seizures before he was 3.          Around the time my sister was born my grandfather told my Parents "That dog has to go"      And they wouldn't do that....he had never shown any agression toward me and they knew that dog was my best friend.      After my sister was born he turned on my mom       and after 3 years with him....my grandfather took him to the shelter.      A shelter worker actually took him home that day...problems and all.   She thought she could help him.      I was 10 years old when I lost my best friend and didn't know until the day of that it was going to happen.      What could have been wrong with him?   Why did that happen?      Here is a picture:    http://www.i-love-dogs.com/forums/member...

20090222145836AAiDvb1	Pets;Fish	Fish tank smells like rotten eggs after only 3 days!?	Well i am VERYY aware i did this in the wrong order so don't even say anything about me doing it wrong i just wanna know how to fix it so my fish tank and room stop smelling like this, i can't take it......ANYWAY i bought a 10 gallon fish tank from meijer and rinsed it out, filled it with tap water put in the dechlorinater and the anti-ammonia stuff then i put in my BETTA. I then bought the filter put it together and put it in the tank and turned it on, i then bought plants and rocks and put them in there, i rinsed and rinsed and rinsed the rocks before i put them in there but when i put them in there the water got cloudy, so maybe the debris clogged the filter? idk but the first 2 days it was PERFECT, so perfect i decided to get a PLeco and threw him in there. i put some pleco food in there for him and i feed the betta 5 pellets everyday. today is the first day it has stunk and it is like rotten eggs. and it makes my room stink...i called soldan's and asked them what to do and they said bring in the water tomarrow (cause they were closed) and they will test it but for today try some sea salt, so i did that and it hasn't seemed to help...so idk, HOW DO I FIX THIS? my only guess is new filter, change 50% of water...i really have no idea though, only people that know what there talking about please, cause i could sit and guess just as well as anyone. i really need help cause i don't want any fish to die and i can't stand this smell.

20090222152054AAKXyOK	Pets;Dogs	My puppy is mean to my wife?	I have a 10 week old puppy.  She has learned not to bite pant legs and she knows what "no bite" means and will respond to it when I say it.  The problem is that she is totally mean to my wife; she bites at and even rips her clothes and will bit her, as well.  It is more prominent when I am not around, but she will do it with me there too.  I have left her with other people and she will not bite them or break the rules, even with me gone, so I tend to think it is specific to my wife.  My wife treats her exactly as I do, stern but not mean, and loving when she does good things.  Thanks for any help in advance.

About 4 months ago we got a kitten for our cat to make friends with so he wasn't so alone it took him about a month to get used to her and play with her and make friends. But now we have a puppy that we got 2 months ago, he is now 4 months old he plays with the kitten we recently got but my older cat will have nothing to do with him and actually hates him after 2 months still he barely comes inside. Is there anyway to get my cat to get along with my dog besides just giving it time. (Also the older cat is neutered)

The only way he'd eat is if I take a spoon and press it to his mouth, but if  take him to the bowl, or bring the bowl to him, he runs away.

20090222100606AAiZGjB	Pets;Cats	When will they start moving around?	My 1 year old cat gave birth on Friday the 20th to 2 cute black and white kittens for the first time. They are drinking milk, and being healthy. All four cats are healthy. (the female one, the male one, and the two kittens) I'm just way too excited about them and want to see them start walking around and being naughty like the male cat.   So;   1) when will the female cat start moving around like before? (shes all the time with the kittens feeding them milk; she just goes when she wants to eat, drink and use the cat litter)   2)and when will the cute kitties start moving around like their father?   Thanks!

20090222160105AAayOZ5	Pets;Dogs	Help! My new puppy is peeing like a maniac!?	All the housetraining websites i have read say to pick the dog up and carry it outside as soon as you see it go in the house, and praise them once they pee out there. but even if i pick her up in the middle of going she finishes as i carry her outside. So she doesn't have to pee when we get out there, and we wander around the back yard for a long time and get nothing done. Am i missing something here? She's not really concerned when i yell "no" and run across the room to pick her up, and i don't think she's getting the messasge. What do i do?      Also, she peed like 10 times in the past two hours, and i know that isn't normal. Not even for a puppy (she's 3 months old and I just got her today). What could be causing this?

20090222160117AADS9ZW	Pets;Cats	Cat hasn't gone to the litter box yet.....should i be worried?	I adopted a cat from the local humane society on Thursday afternoon and picked her up on Friday (She got fixed in that time).  When I got her she was recently stitched up because of the surgery.      When I picked her up, she was sneezing, and the vet said she had upper respiratory infection, which I was told is very normal for pets (especially those from the kennel), and I was given medication for her, which I have been giving.      The big issue is, since Friday she has not used the litter box at all.  As soon as I got her home for the first time I placed her in the litter box (which was in my garage, which is on the first floor of my condo), so that she would know where it was.      But after coming upstairs and having her run around and explore, she hasn't gone back to the garage to do her business.      I've double/triple checked the condo to make sure she hasn't gone to the bathroom in a closet or under a bed or something, but I haven't found anything.      Then I thought that maybe she just doesn't like the litter box or garage, so today I bought another litter box and placed it in the bathroom on the second floor.  I came home and placed her in that litter box too, and still she hasn't gone.      Since I brought her home, she's eaten about half a 5.5oz can of soft cat food, and she's eaten a little bit of dry food, and drank a bit of water, so she should have gone to the bathroom by now, right?  At which point should I be worried?  Thanks

20090222155415AAp5gg5	Pets;Cats	My cat walks funny since I got her?	My cat has had a funny walk since the day I got her when she was a year old, she is 3 now.  She is a tortoiseshell calico and she has long skinny legs.  It always looks like when she is walking one hind legs is shorter than the other as her rear end sways when she walks, or it looks like her hind legs together might be too long.  It's kind of hard to explain.  When she runs it's even worse because her hind end starts going off to the side.  Also, if you push on her with any kind of force she plops down rear end first on the floor.  She doesn't appear to be bothered by it and is a very happy kitty.  I only worry because she is gaining a little weight and if there is something wrong, I'm worried it might stress her hips more than it would if she walked fine.  Anyone have any idea what might be wrong with her?
20090222160213AAQO2TA	Pets;Dogs	How do I deal with my new and possibly abused dog?	I just took in a husky mix, Sampson.  He is a loving but VERY timid dog.  A friend asked me to take him in because she was moving and already has two dogs.  Sampson showed up at her house in October, he is very skiddish around people. He wouldn't come near her or her family so she put a dog house outside for when it rained.  He finally started warming up and with a lot of coaxing would come in when it was cold or raining.  Now that he is here he is very shy.  He hasn’t eaten or drank anything since yesterday.  As soon as I pick up a leash to take him out he runs; he is so scared of leashes and belts.  Once I get him on the leash he gets really stiff and refuses to walk.  I took him to the off leash doggy park today, HE LOVED IT! He was so comfortable and playful with the other dogs.  But when I was ready to leave Sampson wanted to stay.  It took me an hour to convince him it was okay to leave. I didn't want to scare him; he just won't come to me yet. I don't know if I should continue taking him there or wait until he is used to me enough to come when I am ready to go.  I really want to give him a loving family, he deserves it!

He is new to our home and we now have two dogs.I give the two dogs seperate food dishes and water because only the puppy i have found a worm. The people i bought from said hed been wormed and has had his first shots. I gave the puppy another treatment yesturday after he puked the worm up. I have not seen any worms since, just that one. The puppy has also had diarriah, but has had no worms in the diarriah, and he will only eat human food. I have a few questions.... Can i get the worms by touching and playing with him? Can our other dog get them by sharing toys and playing with each other by biting and such? I know its unhealthy to feed them human food but if don't feed him something i fear he will die of starvation. I also baby sit my 7 month old cousin and that makes me nervous when the puppy gets around the baby. Please answer this i can't stop worrying about the worms.

20090222121940AAGyufl	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone have a black lab who isn't food crazy?	I'm wondering if this is a breed thing or just my dog...but my dog Bailey is a female black lab, and she has always been CRAZY about food...it's like the driving force for her life.  She's very well behaved - she doesn't jump on table or counters if there's food on them and nobody is around...but after dinner, she sits under the table for hours, hoping someone will give her something even though we're gone.  When it's feeding time, she goes crazy, starts barking and whining while we fill her dish up, drooling all over, and starts chowing down on the food before we can even put it down.      It's just her attitude.  There are many words she knows - food, eat, treat, biscuit, turkey.  Sometimes my mom gives her a small scrap of turkey when carving it, and she uses the electric knife.  So now whenever Bailey hears the electric knife, if she is in the other room laying down she quick jumps up and runs to the kitchen.  If she hears the whipped cream can spray she jumps up and runs in.  She's absolutely nuts.      So are all labs like this, or just Bailey?  I'm wondering if it's a breed thing, or individual.

20090222120227AASTqL0	Pets;Dogs	How can I make her more independent?	My dog, Chickoa, and I have a *very* strong connection.   On both sides.   She can't stand being away from me for more than a few hours during the day, and I've recently become even more attached than before.   Heck, just last night I was visiting my brother [whom has a dog of his own], and I couldn't help but wish I was petting Chickoa instead of him!!   Either way.   I'm sure half of the babying that I've done is due to the fact that she acts *exactly* like a 7 week old pup.      Whenever there's a noise she doesn't like, she runs to me for comfort.   Whenever someone makes her feel frightened, she runs to me.   If I'm petting another dog for "too long" in her eyes, she pushes past them to me.   She's very possessive over me, but not to the point where she'll even come close to attacking any other dog.      I do baby her, and I've been cutting that down as much as possible, but I think she might be sensing that and is holding on much tighter.      So how can I help to make her more independent and more confident of herself?   I don't want her hating me in the future when I get another dog/animal and "pet them for too long".         Any ideas?   Thanks.
20090222120916AAYpivb	Pets;Dogs	Be Honest: Which of these two dogs would you be more likely to adopt?	If you went to the pound, and found two dogs [let's say for this sake, they were the only two for adoption at that time].   It's your ideal gender and your ideal breed.      The first dog: a puppy, needs to be fully trained, comes from an abusive home and needs some encouragement -- is healthy.   The second dog: an older dog, is fully trained, needs daily medication, and often vet visits -- has hip dysplasia and cataracts.         Which one would you be more likely to adopt, if approved for both?   You *can't* take both.      Which one?   Please be honest.   Thank You.

20090222114339AA3Ft5Z	Pets;Horses	My Cobx freaks out when a horse passes?	In the summer I was leading him on a bridle-way by a canal.  The boats totally freaked him out and eventually he got out of my grip and galloped home, about 2 miles away.      It knocked his confidence and we went on a downhill battle.         I also led him along the road and a horse passed. He got out of my grip and cantered after it.   After he started galloping and bucking me off, I got the vet out to check him over.  He passed a health check and so I started Parelli with him, which has done wonders.  The only trouble now is he is still more jumpy on hacks than he was before the incident, and the main problem :      If a horse passes us (even if he doesn't know the horse) he will suddenly start plunging around on the road and dancing on the spot trying to follow it.  I wouldn't mind but its putting the other horse and rider in danger, and I want my old horse back.         What can I do?

I noticed that there is no live help website around animals, cats and dogs are lost EVERYDAY, people lose there snakes, or are not sure what to do when it comes to certain situations, there are simply loads of situations a person could need help with to do with pets...      That's why i have decided to create a website (done) that will allow a person with problems with there pet (aggressive pets,lost, feeding or any Information needed)... I am having only one problem, getting volunteer operators that will help people with animal troubles that need help or information... I personally think it would be a helpful website.

He's 8 years old I've had him since he was a pup, he's fully up to date with inoculations and he sees the vet annually, he is a beautiful dog, but... recently he's started whining, and wanting more attention, I have two young children and I can't give him all the attention he wants.  We're also struggling for money due to the current financial climate and we would benefit from not paying out on vets bills, food, kennels etc.  I'm terrified of taking him to be re homed in case the homing centre thinks I'm a horrible person for getting rid of him.  I don't actually want him to go, but I dont' think we're giving him what he needs.  I've always been adament that when you have a pet, you have a pet for life, and i'd feel terrible backtracking on that.  What shall we do?

20090222121312AAMliTn	Pets;Dogs	Did you know PETA and HSUS wanted Vicks Pits put to sleep?	I was looking up the Pit Bulls seized from Michael Vick's disgusting house, to see how they were doing and found the following statements:   Best Friends worked behind the scenes to ensure the dogs’ future, even as other groups pushed for them to be euthanized. A spokeswoman from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called them “ticking time bombs,” and said that “rehabilitating fighting dogs is not in the cards.”       The Humane Society of the United States agreed with PETA. “Officials from our organization have examined some of these dogs and, generally speaking, they are some of the most aggressively trained pit bulls in the country,” HSUS president and chief executive officer Wayne Pacelle told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in early August. “Hundreds of thousands of less-violent pit bulls, who are better candidates to be rehabilitated, are being put down. The fate of these dogs will be up to the government, but we have recommended to them, and believe, they will be eventually put down.”       Wow! They didn't even want to give the dogs a chance! That really ticks me off, and I'm so glad that the dogs have been rehabilitated and given the chance to live a happy life like they deserved in the first place! Best Friends did the right thing by stepping in to save the Pit Bulls from being put to sleep, because not only are Pits incredible dogs, but I sure as heck believe they deserved it!      So, what is your thoughts on the statements? And, if you are one of those close minded, ignorant people who think Pits are 'vicious' then go troll elsewhere, cuz' you aren't wanted here!

20090222123343AAGU66D	Pets;Dogs	How should I convince my dad to let me get another dog?	We have a rescue collie that's a family dog.  We got it when I was very young, so I was not able to train him and no one else did.  I have tried training him now, but I think its too late.  He is very sweet, so I would never give him away.  Our family divides up taking care of him, and I brush his teeth, sweep up the dog hair, and take him for walks.  I do these and other household chores.  I also work really hard in school and get good grades.  I have asked my dad if I can have a dog of my own, but I think he has some animal block.  How should I convince him?  I am hoping to get a lab for my eighth grade graduation, or my birthday in June.  Thank you, hope you can help me.

20090222114301AAWQ76h	Pets;Dogs	What is the law for refunding money when a puppy dies from parvo? (Arizona specifically)?	I bought a malti poo puppy on the 17th. Something about the deal didn't seem right.       She was a beautiful and very well loved little thing in our home.      Late on the 20th she started to act funny. The morning of the 21st I took her to the Animal hospital to have her checked out. She had a strong positive for parvo with a high white count and extremely low blood sugar. At 17 ounces her chances were not good and we had to make the horribly hard decision to put her down.       I can't explain how emotionally draining it is to have to end the life of a beautiful 6 wk old puppy. There really aren't any words for it. Just a lot of tears. A lot of them.      I informed the "breeder" that she had parvo and that likely meant the other puppies had it also. Supposedly they had sold all the puppies before I found out this dog was ill. Now he's saying he has 2 from the litter and they're healthy and happy puppies. This morning he also said he took them to a vet to get checked out. It's Sunday, nothing is open for an appt. it's all emergency care. I don't believe a word of it.      He says he is going to refund my purchase price, I didn't ask for a refund of the vet bills. I'm not sure if I believe him or not. His story and attitude is changing too much for my liking.      He said he doesn't have parvo in his house and I must have taken her somewhere. Well, don't know where I would take a 17 ounce puppy, it's not like she can frolic in the grass at a park. Also, I'm not an idiot and would never put a puppy in that position, especially one as tiny as that. I had to tell him that parvo doesn't show signs until 7-14 days after infection takes place. It's highly unlikely that she contracted parvo, started showing symptoms and had a very strong test result in a matter of 4 days.      I told him my house was built by us and has never had another dog in it besides the one I've owned for 10 years who has never contracted parvo. We've never had other dogs through this house.      I'd like to know what the recourse for this is, as I do not really believe he is going to refund my money.

20090222120848AAU4HyK	Pets;Dogs	Is my dog pregnant or could this be a false pregnancy?	I had a german shepherd male. my neighbor has a german shepherd female (both intact). The female went into heat and was in my neighbors backyard. My male jumped the fence and mounted her. He was not on there very long and they never got stuck together, but i am not sure about all the details of what went on (if you know what i mean). We seperated the dogs within a minute or so.       Well the neighbor said that she quickly seemed to be out of heat. We were not happy about this, and hoped she was not pregnant.  Then about a week later my dog got very ill, and i  found out that my dog had cancer. He died shortly after.  :(    Now both my neighbor and i hope she is pregnant. She is producing milk. She would be about 8 weeks if it took. The things i read said that it is unlikely she would be pregnant from such a short encounter. Can anyone offer any insight. i know i should have her to the vet, but my neighbor would need me to pay for that, and unfortunately my boys cancer just cost me 3,000. So i just don't have the $.      What are the chances she got pregnant. Do you think this is a false pregnancy.

I'd rather not have any criticisms on this rather foolish question, but if you must, go right ahead.        The way he plays with other dogs is he kind of darts around side-to-side and then quickly lunges and then darts backwards at the other dog.      I wonder if I'm just too boring, that I just stay, kneeling in one spot, mabye I should run around alot like a dog, lol.       Does anyone have any suggestions, heheh? Should I ease him and pull on his leg or tap him on the side real quick, or what?      Does anyone play with their doe one0on0one like I am trying to do? Or just fetch and tug of war and toys and stuff?      Thanks for all the help!
20090222120217AA2zkrJ	Pets;Cats	My cats don't get along!  Very Sad?	I have 2 male Kittens (neutered)  that I adopted from a shelter, They are both 5 months (same litter).  Yesterday I saved an older dwarf tabby female 11 years of age (not spayed).  She's been mal treated over the years and i thought since she was so mellow with the other female cat at that house she would do fine with young kittens if i simply let them sniff her out with my supervision.    The first night she did nothing but hiss so i made a bed in my bedroom closet and gave her food and a litter box (in fear she would hurt the kittens).  I also figured they could sniff safely through the cracks.  Well Today i took her out and she was mellow and fine.  the boys sniffed her and she began to growl.  A few hours later she began to attack a kitten violently  and when i intervened she bit and locked jaw on my hand and lets say i was not slightly injured by this seemingly small establishing dominance attack.        My problem is that should i wait it out?  What if she hurts my kittens while I'm at work?  Do i keep her locked up in the closet all day?  do i give her up to a shelter when she clearly needs TLC for all she had gone though with her previous owner (i took her after she had not been fed for 3 weeks and they put liquor in her drinking water) .  Or should i put her down in fear she'll attack another person the way she attacked me?      I'm very sad and confused I have never run into such a problem!  :(
20090222120317AADNsyw	Pets;Dogs	Trying to find a reputable breeder?	How long does it generally take to find a reputable breeder?! I live in Colorado and I've been researching for a month looking for reputable pug breeders. I have searched all the breeder referral sites from AKC and even contacted the local pug club. I haven't heard anything back yet,but I'm hoping that I will. I am a responsible pet owner which is why I'm putting in all this effort. It's so frustrating. By the way, if your answer is I should just adopt a mixed breed from a shelter don't bother. I HAVE adopted mix breeds from shelter's and they are wonderful dogs. Now I am searching for a pure bred. Why is it so difficult!

20090222121931AAPaLmT	Pets;Dogs	I have tried many different things and my puppy won't eat her food.?	Ok, I read these posts and have the same problem. I have tried almost every brand at the store and none of them work. We have a lab and she eats people food just fine. I know this is bad but she absolutely will not eat dog food. We have spent so much money trying out foods but none work. I don't think there is anything wrong with her mouth or teeth because she will eat treats, people food and toys just fine. We can't keep buying food that is just going to go to waste. Have also tried not giving her anything but her food and she doesn't care. She still won't eat for days.  Any suggestions?

20090222122222AAisZwO	Pets;Cats	Should i put my cat to sleep?	my cat is about 6-9 years old and overweight, he means the absolute world to me and my family, we rescued him and lovee him with all our hearts. lately, he had a urinary track infection. we took him to the vet and they want tooo much money for a surgery that my family simply does not have. we later took him to another vet and they gave him some antibiotics that eventually made the symptoms go away. we were very happy but unfortunately they came back. he cant pee and hes always trying to, hes very weak, can barely walk, doesnt eat, and throws up everyonce in  a while. we can tell he's suffering and wont even look at our faces. you can see the pain in the poor cats eyes. we were wondering, its better to put him to sleep than for him to suffer, but its just too hard. i know its the right thing, but idk how,where or if i should do it, it'll hurt and ill cry alot but i know its hurting him more to be sick. any help, advise, and tips on what i should do? my family and i are really broke, but we want the best for our beloved cat.
20090222122403AAxO0k7	Pets;Other - Pets	Any advice on finding a rabbit?	I've had a rabbit before; I had him for 6 long years before he died, so I know plenty about rabbit care.  However, after several years I'm looking to buy a new one.  I bought my first rabbit from a pet store, and while I don't mind buying from a pet store I was hoping to use a breeder this time.  Unfortunately, there are none within 2 hours of me, and I'd like to be able to face to face pick out the animal rather than send away for one.  Also, and please don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not looking for a rescue bunny.  The only reason for this is that I'm looking for a 2 month old (which is how old they are when they first start to sell), as I want to be able to "raise" it rather than get an adult rabbit.        My question, is what are the best pet stores that you have heard, or have had, the best luck with?  I don't even think the little local pet store I bought my last rabbit from is still in business =(

20090222123725AALijJZ	Pets;Dogs	HELP!  My boxer's ear is chronically split at the tip...?	We have a 3 year old female boxer without cropped ears.  The tip of one of her ears has split and we can't seem to get it closed. This is something that has slowly gotten worse over the past year or two.  I've tried liquid bandage, gauze/wrapping, creams, and every other potion in the book.  Every time she shakes her head, the split opens back up and my walls are taking the brunt of the blood splatter!   Just last week, we took her to the vet to try and have the wound stitched closed.  When we picked her up, it was still red and bloody and now it has a very large scab on it.  Trouble is, the scab keeps splitting and the shaking has popped at least one of the stitches.   Any ideas on how to combat this problem for good?!  I feel so badly for her, it seems to cause her constant irritation - and what we thought would help (the suture) has only seemed to make it worse!  Please help.

She is currently 10 lbs., adorable terrier mix. We absolutley LOVE her and want her to benefit from proper training.  I have read all kinds of info so understand why they do it but most of the suggestions sound like they were written by non-dog owners.  As if it were as simple as walking away and giving her the cold shoulder...hard to do when she's attacking your feet/ankles.

20090222140244AATP45h	Pets;Cats	My cat is having a potty problem... What to do?	My mom's cat, Leo, seems to just go to the bathroom anywhere and everywhere EXCEPT his litterbox. We know he knows how to use it, because he has used it before, and we clean it out on a daily basis... But the cat will go ANYWHERE besides the litterbox... He peed on a pile of my brother's undershirts, he pooped on the same brother's bed, he pooped on my mother's bed and pillow, he pooped in our dog's bed, and last night, he pooped on a living room couch and pillow... The only place he has yet to poop is in MY room, and in my little sister's room... He can't go to the bathroom in my little sister's room because her door is always closed, but Leo's food and water is in my room. I also have a cat, Louie, who has no problem using the litterbox, and Louie and Leo share food and water, and so that's why I keep it in my room. I want to shut my door so Leo can't get in there and go to the bathroom, but the food and water is in there and I don't want to move it because I don't want to have to change things for Louie as well, and I don't want Louie to be trapped in or outside of my room. What should we do about Leo not using the litterbox?

20090222131605AA4jd4q	Pets;Cats	Found 2 cats in my yard, I don't know how to take care of them, help please.?	On Friday afternoon, 2 cats came to my house and stayed outside of it. My house is all glass so we could see each other. They stayed the entire night and kept trying to get in, around midnight they curled up together against the door and went to sleep. I was worried about raccoons and coyotes in the neighborhood as well as the cold. I've taken them in and they are very friendly, I think they are indoor cats who have gotten out while their owners are away for the weekend. Anyways I have no idea how to care for them, they are obviously lost because when I go out with them during the day they run all over the yard looking for something (I assume the way home) but then return when they can't find it.       Anyways I've put up signs and stuck notices in the neighborhood mailboxes and called the SPCA and left my number but in the mean time while I have them what do I do for them.  I've only ever had dogs. How much to they eat? Should I give them treats? How often do I change the litter box (I bought one)? Just some basic info would be helpful. I've been keeping them in an empty room in the house because I'm very allergic to cats but I go in and visit and let them out in the yard during the day.

20090222132301AANXJwt	Pets;Cats	This question requires knowledge of cats and their hydration needs?	I took my 9 year old cat (female, spayed) to her new vet 2 days ago and was thrilled with the doctor's knowledge, diagnostic abilities, etc. She stated that the cat was dehydrated. HOWEVER, some other issues of greater severity came up and we didn't re-visit the dehydration problem. Well, the doctor is moving this week-end and can't be reached. I hate to contact her partner with what is definitely not an EMERGENCY issue.  So, here's my question:      What can I do to get more liquid into this furry family member? Is there anything that can be added to the water to make it "tastier?" All ideas will be greatly appreciated.

But, Now all her teeth are gone and she can not eat any hard food. So, Now we have been feeding her soft food. We have been feeding her 9 Lives Soft Cat Food. But, I'm worried she isn't getting what she needs. Because it isn't nutritious cat food.  But, She won't eat any hard food and I don't really have the money to buy better soft cat food. She goes through like 2 small cans a day. Also she has been peeing and defecating on the carpet anywhere she pleases and she keeps meowing and doesn't shut up. What do I do? Will a vet put her down?
