20090227141235AABo3iu	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can someone PLEASE help me interpret these Rita Dove poems i have NO idea what they mean...?	Safety First.          Never point your weapon, keep your finger    off the trigger. Assume a loaded barrel,    even when it isn’t, especially when you know it isn’t.    Glocks are lightweight but sensitive;    the Keltec has a long pull and a kick.    Rifles have penetrating power, viz.:    if the projectile doesn’t lodge in its mark,    it will travel some distance    until it finds shelter; it will certainly    pierce your ordinary drywall partition.    You could wound the burglar and kill your child    sleeping in the next room, all with one shot.             Open Air.          Fear, of course. Then the sudden    pleasure of heft—as if the hand    had always yearned for this solemn    fit, this gravitas, and now had found    its true repose.          Don’t pull the trigger, squeeze it—    squeeze between heartbeats.    Look down the sights. Don’t    hold your breath. Don’t hold    anything, just stop breathing.    Level the scene with your eyes. Listen.    Soft, now: squeeze.

20081014224015AA21B6I	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	In movie sex scenes, do actors/actresses really have sex with each other?	It would make sense since most of them are attractive and so they wouldn't have any problem there. Plus, if they can't act because of the nature of the scene, wouldn't it be in their interest to just do it. I mean it's not like a porn shot 'cause they get paid more...j/k.      I'm specifically referring to Monster's Ball. Where Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry have sex. Is it real, or is it acting?
20081007232832AAMcV0N	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	PLEEEAAASE help me name this poem...?	I have to shorten this up so all you ignorant little kids can understand this.   These patterned scars trace lines on my arms   They hold a story too long for me to tell   But I'm not trying to win you over with my charms   No, I'm trying to bring you under my ripped umbrella   And so what, so what if your eyes can't lay anywhere but my scars   You can't see the bars that held me around my mute atmosphere   I know you don't care.   But you know this embarrasing attention isn't fair   All their quiet little stares their cerious inocent glares   I wear these scars like nessesary accessories   The memores of when the pain pleased me and eased my trouble   I can't draw on my arms what I draw on paper but the message is still the same   And I still seem sane enough. This **** feels like a game, and I won. I put everyone else to shame.   They left me to blame.   And I'm sick, and pissed of the person I became.   A wounded tiger with no one to call it's prey.   A prisoner in an imaginary world.   A sad young little run-away.   I hate this redemption I inflicted on myself.   I'm just a profit of some demented skeloten.   ...And you ask why?   Why!?   You make it sound like it's a sin.   Why I pushed the knife into my skin?   Why I let this monster out that hid within?   I ask you.   Why did he let me?   Why did that asshole son of a demon let me ruin my life with the knife I held so closly to me?   Why didn't you see how this feeling made me so empty?   When this one crawls his way through barbbed wire and frees himself from insanity   And this one sends herself to damnation.   This one weak, this one strong.   Warrior like reflexes   blood stained dress.   confess confess your weakness.   Don't suppress.   This is not about him.   He's just the reason the cause the mess.   Scars scatter throughout my entire body.   Rouph paintings drawn on by me.   A sensless wise compromise.   Shattered mirrors find their place on my walls.   I don't need help. I never needed help.

20080924134956AAjsa1C	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem?	~Silent Strangers~      This constant weary dread,    always fills my head.    I just wish it would stop,   and for once let me finish on top.    As I struggle through this life,    I realize my struggles are not alone.    These silent strangers that surround me   have a story of their own.    The child sitting on the bench,     kicking at a can.   He wonders where his fathers at   and if he will ever see his face again.    He wonders what he did    that made his father leave.   He wishes in his heart    that they could have a fresh start.   Unbeknownst to him    the problems are far gone.    The young girl bent over her books,   her life is full of crooks.   Her mother stole her own life,    because she thought she wasn't a good wife.    Her father left her when she was barely grown,   she was taken to a foster home.    The man in the fancy suit,   he was born outside a coal shoot.     As a child he found out,   life is harder than they make it out.    He wondered the streets,   just looking for a place to sleep.   That old man with the crippled hands,    never found out his life plan.    He worked all the time,   till it was to late.    His family died an ill fate    and he wished now he didn't wait.     So now I look at my life    and I am thankful for my lot.   The silent strangers that I see    have had it so much harder than me.   Why should I complain   when my God is ever near   to answer my prayers.    When I have doubts or fears,    I may shed my silent tears.    Though in my heart I will always know,   all I have to do is sit still and let my God take control.

Two types of mythical predators actually existed. Werewolves and Vampires. Me. And Clay.      Dolphina Star is an ordinary 17 year-old. That is until she gets bit by a werewolf and becomes one herself. A week before her bite, her 5-year long crush had been bitten by a vampire so he became one himself. They find that they are now sworn-enemies but that they are also soul-mates. However, Dolphina's pack, and Clay's clan lay down a law that they try very hard to disobey. The law is that they either have to kill the other, or to never see each other again. Can Clay and Dolphina escape their law, or will they end up killing each other?

I know this may sound a little silly...but their has to be a reason why your favorite colour kind of well 'is'...if you get what I mean.      For example I was once reading a book. It said something along the lines of:      If you take the whole series of these books and lay them out in front of you and you were perticularly drawn to this very one it may have been because your first trike was this colour (yellow) and bought back happy memories to you therefore you pick this book.      Simple really. Hadn't thought of it though Sigmund Freud had!

He was different then the others, he seemed confident and showed leader ship. The man in the dark coat jumped down from the highest branch of the tallest tree. My heart skipped a beat. He was so graceful and beautiful all at once, he had the most glimmering brown eyes I had ever seen. I stared at him studying his face, he showed concern in his eyes as well as curiousity.

I noticed that there are 2 microphone ports along with the usb which i use to plug into my computer. My question is, if i buy a condensor mic can i use the RP350 as a preamp? I am not sure how all of this works but i just want the best sounding thing i can get for my vocals. Will the RP give me a great signal or would something be better? I want to try to save as much money as possible, but the mic I would be plugging into the RP350 would most likely be a $400 Blue Bottle Mic.

I can't help but feel as if my life has stopped right before my eyes   I can see all the flash backs before my eyes reminding me of how things once were   How I used to be before everything seemed to fade away from me   Leaving me...    Standing on the edge of a cliff looking below me seeing the depths of my dreams   Everyone around me seems to stop in there footsteps...   Not making any movement   But I feel like everyone around me is moving still..   Except me...   I cant help the fact that...   I can't see my future any longer..   I can't see myself smiling in the days light..   I wish I could be standing there with the one only person that makes me smile every time I see their face..   But do they ever stop and think...   Just like I seem to do..   This world I seem to live in,   Feels like a place where everything is just dark and cold..   I have little hope left in me as I barely finish the days that come..   I've said to myself everyday that I am working to make my dream come true..   It seems impossible now in our world of differences..   For all I need now...   Is just one word from them to keep me going..   I'm left behind watching everyone walk forward..   Continuing their lives the way they want them to be..   But I'm stuck behind this invisible force keeping me from going on my path..   Maybe it is meant to be..   Maybe this is where I take a different path...   A Different Path...

20090307111505AAVEopV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this interest you? Honest opinion!?	I don't know the title of my story, but I have a pretty good idea what it's going to be about. Please read.       “GO BACK!” a hoarse voice croaked    “No,” I started, “I won’t go back! I’m going to get to that platform no matter what!” I shouted     “At your own risk!”    The golden door encrusted with jewels swung open. I stepped forward, and let out a scream. I was sliding down, almost not touching, a steep chute of some sort. I landed on the ground with a thud. When I opened my eyes, I was in a room with a Minotaur keeping me company.      I know it's short, but I wanted somebody's opinion on it. It's going to go into a story that I'm writing, so, don't be afraid to give constructive criticism!
