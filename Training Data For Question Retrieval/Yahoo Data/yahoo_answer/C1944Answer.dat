sMNEooBVaa	The three phones are:<br>  Motorola W755<br>  LG VX8360<br>  Samsung SCH-u430<br>  <br>   For Maine, you will recieve your phone around April and the actual switch to use the phone will be May 17th. You can keep your plan untill the contract is up (If you like your plan) or you can start a new contract with the (without paying a cancelation fee) and get any phone you want for their price. Hope I helped!
AA11065140	Here's one...The "Sensory Assault" alarm clock.  It uses sound, light, and shaking the bed to wake you.  At 85 decibels, it roughly sounds like a bulldozer idling in your bedroom.  If that doesn't wake you, nothing will!

Pros and Cons. Also if you play the video, you can watch someone going through the phone, features, and what they think about the phone. So it gives you a look at the phone without actually having to go all the way to the store to see it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  I directed the link to the LG Scoop for you already.|`|bb6cd77825eb74955d957ac23093ab37aa	to me its kinda hard to hear out of it and doesn't have that many features.

57480649613941c1fb8c81765ddf29f2aa	The other answer is right, you can't have them on both 360's at the same time. What you & your girlfriend can do is to get a couple of memory cards & just keep your profiles on them, that way any 360 that you play can have your gamertag on it, wether it's at your house or a friend's. You just have to always remember to bring your memory card with you to the 360 that you plan to use.|`|P7D1bsQaaa	No I dont think so.|`|wIM3vNtwaa	No, they can only exist in one place at a time. To have it on another 360, recover the gamertag but then it won't be on the original XBOX 360 that it was on first. Keep recovering it on whatever XBOX 360 you want to use<br>  <br>  EDIT: This applies to XBOX 360
GbWmAGy7aa	Saving your money is ALWAYS the best option. The more you save now, the more you'll have later. Suppose you have 200 now. You will get another 200 in a year. Lets say that you buy a dress for 200 now. And when you get your other 200 and buy jeans for 50. You will have 150 left in a year from now. But THEN you see a REALLY nice dress thats 400.<br>  <br>  If you had saved the 200 now and the 200 in a year, you would have enough money to buy that pretty Cinderella dress!|`|qFAPqHrwaa	Cant go wring with saving it and wait untill you see something you like! or.. you can give it to me!!|`|Iw3ot1oDaa	save it or buy some clothes you like
QpO1a3b8aa	Here's my novice thoughts: <br>  <br>  Are you using iTunes to check the memory? I used Media Monkey to check it, and it showed different results than iTunes(almost a GB more). Does this program save on the iPod itself?<br>  It may be the software that you are using. Uninstall it from the computer! If you go on the computer you are using with the program it may automatically include it?! Try another computer maybe... If this is the case, try Media Monkey. Now I don't want to seem like a barter or promoter, but you only need to select your iPod menu on the side and it plays all the songs off the iPod. It not much space at all(30.36 MB and you can then remove that program, and the Windows media player if need be. I re-download iTunes every once and a while to update my iPod and check the ACCURATE amount of space.  Also, be sure to check the iPod folder for any extra files.<br>  <br>  This isn't your problem but:<br>  I don't have very many songs, but my iPod has less memory used up than my brothers(who has many songs), but for each song, I have an Album Art.|`|9K0OEPS7aa	Erm,, Connect your iPod. Go to My Computer. Go into your iPod folder and see if there is any junk lying around in there.|`|JI2x62nLaa	Well it take nearly a GB to install the OS but the rest would be stuff you put on there.
poFoBoYKaa	-sharp intake of breath- I dunno about under $70.<br>  <br>  But I work at a Staples and we've got this amazing system. I got it for Christmas. I would imagine it works with the second generation.<br>  <br>  It's got a sweeet remote (power, pause, volume, skip) that fits into the back if you don't want to lose it. It has that omnidirectional sound, so you can sit it in the middle of the room and it'll sound the same everywhere. It's portable, you can even run it off batteries (something like 6 C batteries though).<br>  <br>  Plus it's black!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.staples.ca/ENG/Catalog/cat_sku.asp?CatIds=&webid=766822&affixedcode=WW" rel="nofollow">http://www.staples.ca/ENG/Catalog/cat_sk...</a><br>  <br>  Here's one by the same maker, but I'm not sure if it's good quality sound.

2vBYTCUDaa	If you want it in HD you need to use the HDMI cable. If you use the RCA  or VGA cables that come with it you will lose the HD because the cables cannot transfer the HD signal.|`|bPrR6IxBaa	I use the cables that came with it and it looks pretty good on mine, but I'm sure it would look even better with an HDMI cable.|`|8EPX8bpyaa	They HDMI will make it look better.  I had mine connected to my 52" without, when I put it on it was much better.
57480649613941c1fb8c81765ddf29f2aa	An HDMI cable isn't a necessity, but it does make for a good picture.<br>  The component cable that comes with the system will still give you a nice picture. I use the component cable on my 15" LCD & a HDMI on my 32". The really good benefit to using an HDMI cable is that it's all you need. HDMI transfers audio & video to your TV in one connection instead of five connections (red, blue, green, red &white) for component or three for a composite (yellow, red & white) connection.|`|fCl7qwD2aa	if you get the pro console it will come with high definition cables anyway. there called component cables. blue,red and green. then white and red  for the sound. So your good to go out of the box. On a 32" it wont make a huge difference having HDMI but i would still get an HDMI cable later on.|`|tXvOVsBXaa	an hd mi cable is only for hd t.v's if u have a regular tv then u will have to use the rugular wires|`|P7D1bsQaaa	I'm not sure.

Then make sure to save it as 'name.txt' (replace the name don't put the 's in there!) the .txt is important. <br>  <br>  Next you want to open iTunes and click the "enable hard-disk mode" in your iPod tab. <br>  <br>  Open up your note again and click "save as.." (If using windows) and keep the same name but find your ipod in the list of places to save it, click it then make sure to save the file in the "notes" category.

IoKjLtN9aa	Here is how I find new music. Go to the site www.pandora.com, it's a free online radio. Once your there it will instruct you what to do after you've made an account basically it's a great place to find music that is similar to the stuff you like!

It is a fairly new service but they are getting really popular.  They offer unlimited music downloads for only $2 a month (I don't know how they do it!) and they are 100% legal.  I've been with them for some time and they have all the songs I need and their download speeds are fast.
N1CIndMOaa	Some of the features you want can be found on the JVC GZ-MG330. You can find them for around $300 if you look for sales and rebates. Check eBay too. Many folks are selling their camcorders for a lot less than retail. <br>  <br>  You are best to use flash memory. A hard drive camera wouldn't take the rough handling around skateboarding. <br>  <br>  YouTube accepts videos uploaded in most formats, including .WMV, .AVI, .MOV, MPEG, .MP4, DivX, .FLV, and .OGG.

w7Ffw6MYaa	you may be trying to use more than 160 characters in your message?? If that's not the issue, remove your SIM card, replace it, then power your phone back on. That may or may not work. If the problem still exists contact Tracfone.<br>  <br>  hope this helps ;-)|`|2vBYTCUDaa	Were you sending an especially long message? This could happen if your message was longer than allowed. If this is the problem break up the message in two parts.<br>  <br>  If you want you can go to a RadioShack and they will actually take care of this for you if they are not busy with other customers. RadioShack is supposed to help with tracfone problems, but can refuse if the store is busy. If they ask you bought it at another RadioShack.<br>  <br>  You can also contact tracfone yourself too. Just tell them what you are having problems with and be prepared to put numbers in the "code entry mode" this is in your menu under prepaid (so you can be ready) they will also ask for your serial number or your esn number. This is under menu then prepaid as well. You might have a SIM number too that will be under that same prepaid menu.
Ccm7xJYTaa	if the wires are ever being squashed or moved arround allot then it will break cheap headphones <br>  do you use them in bed lying down? i always do, and then forget that i had them in and end up sleeping on them which breaks the wires.<br>  <br>  you should just try some more expensive ones with better wires. the actual headphone speakers probably dont break just cheaper headphones have low quality wires. it would be worth saving up and getting some more expensive ones also some headphones at arround $40 might have a few months warranty so if they break you can get them replaced.<br>  <br>  but more expensive ones do last longer, you will probably end up paying less overall if you are currently paying $15 every few months<br>  <br>  look into skullcandy sennheiser or sony headphoens|`|XE3PCLWNaa	I have the same problem!

No but honestly I've gone through hundreds of dollars in those little blue wrap around Sony headphones. I can afford it and all but it is a pain. I recommend doing chores or something. Trust me dude I've had like 3 different iPods and I've noticed that they screw up the only the left headphone first. You can't hear anything out of it for  than it goes to the right about a month later. Don't worry man it's just how those cheap headphones are. Listen I know your situation with ur mother...show this to you mom and maybe shell see that your not trying to make her pull her hair out. Save up some chore money and go get some nice ones LOL haha....right mom?? Haha well anyways just keep in mind your not alone and goodluck.
2vBYTCUDaa	The most DESIRED phone is the IPhone. I guess this would make it the most popular. The most used is the BlackBerry phones. The reason why this is the most used is because it is a smartphone that is cheap enough for everyone to buy. Not everyone wants the accessories for the phones or even the internet when they buy smartphones, it is more of a "look what phone I have!" thing than a useful object. I personally recommend the LG Shine if you want a nice phone and don't care about internet.|`|LoUOWFSfaa	I think it has to be the Iphone. It has big Label on it, easy to use. Not to mention Apple already has millions of buyers for their other products like the Nano, Chromatic, Shuffle, and the Itouch. Its only normal that what's "IN"..is the best phone for everybody. <br>  <br>  I kinda Disagree because every phone has its Negatives, i find some negatives in the Iphone just like in every other phone. Other Major phones like BlackBerry, LG, Samsung are also used a lot among cell phone users.......but in Terms of the most popular (so far), The IPhone Dominates.|`|LHrJp83Uaa	iphone..never advertised,but everyone either has one or wants one.|`|qTQ0l1vBaa	i think maybe a lg dare i mean theres so many commercials on it

3CJAUyqPaa	That a pro would use?<br>  <br>  Low end: Canon HF series or Sony HDR-CX12.<br>  That's about it - and none of the pros I know woud use either of these.<br>  <br>  MiniDV tape provides better video quality because there is too much compression applied to the video stream. I would have recommended the Panasonic AG-HDX200 series - it uses P2 cards - but I remembered it uses firewire to transfer the video files. If you look at what the pros use, check the Sony HVR-V1U, HVRZ1U, HVR-Z5U, HVR-Z7U; Canon XHA1 and HLH Series.. and the JVC GY series... No flash memory.All miniDV tape and transfer using firewire.<br>  <br>  They might use a small throw away pocket cam to throw off a building to see what it looks like to fall, but certain not for anything serious.<br>  <br>  So.. for consumer-grade, the Canon FS100, FS10, FS11 for standard definition meet most of your criteria - you can check on the lenses yourself.<br>  <br>  YouTube reduces the video quality due to compression - this is not the camcorder's fault. My uploaded videos look fine. Use MP4 file type when uploading standard definition video.|`|blmqQmkZaa	Little Dog nailed it!|`|83GYxoApaa	Look into the SONY HDR-SR10, or HDR-SR12.

IoKjLtN9aa	What you wish to do is download something called a "cracked" app. It's illegal, I'm purely telling you for your education. The answer is yes. You infact can do that. So you would download "cracked" apps on your computer from oh say, isohunt.com. After that the user can install them to a jailbroken iPod through iTunes.

Your outlet will have 100, 120, or  240 volts between its points.<br>  <br>  Amps is the current. The cord is rated 10A. If any more current than that flows, the cord could overheat can catch fire.<br>  <br>  Hz  is line frequency.  That is between the set and the power source.

Then you ask them what time do they want to battle. My suggestion though is to get on gamefaqs and set up a battle with someone. You could also download shoddy battle which is a competitive pokemon battling game.

There are no cheats at all in Resident Evil 4 and no way to get them at all. But there are weapons that you can unlock to use in story mode like the Chicago TypeWriter which is an assualt rifle with unlimited ammo(1000000pst), an infinite rocket launcher(1000000pts) and the Handcannon, a special magnum with special ammo, when fully upgraded is the most powerful gun in the game and can have unlimited ammo but can be bought for free when unlocked.

p11sk9qhaa	You'll have to remove the Digital Rights Management (DRM) first. <br>  <br>  The best way to do it is to not buy from iTunes and use Amazon's digital downloads instead. They're DRM free and already in the MP3 format. iTunes is just now starting to offer DRM free music but the price is higher on newer music. Just follow the first link to Amazons digial MP3 download page.<br>  <br>  Probably the most widely accepted method for stripping purchased songs of DRM protection is burning tracks to a CD-R/W then re-importing back into the iTunes library. A method guaranteed to free you of DRM madness.<br>  <br>  * Create an iTunes playlist containing your purchased songs.<br>  * Insert a blank CD-R or a CD-RW.<br>  * Burn the playlist to disk.<br>  * Make sure that iTunes is set up to rip in MP3 (not ACC). On the menu bar click Edit > Prefernces... > General > Import Settings<br>  * Re-import the songs after a successful burn using iTunes.<br>  * Delete the original purchased tracks.<br>  <br>  There's software that'll do it for you too. The second link is to a article at Lifehacker.com that reviews a free piece of software called DoubleTwist that removes the DRM protection.<br>  <br>  The third links also shows how to take the DRM from iTunes purchased files. <br>  <br>  All that said, it's probably against the law to do so.|`|ywmqenCGaa	What you need is just DRM remover software.

5fYvlFwWaa	You may need to take it to an AT&T store. The would probably be able to deal with it there. What may have happened is that the contacts that do not show up on the backup phone were saved to the phone instead of to the SIM card. I know there are ways of getting contacts from a phone without using the screen, usually involving syncing with a computer. If that doesn't help, just take it to AT&T and they most likely would be able to do it, no problem.|`|98yO5gm0aa	sorry man i cant help you but you should try to call your provider and ask they should help yu|`|tAOXo1Fzaa	oh dang. well if you cant see your screen then this might be a problem. but if you can remember how to do it or you can see this little part this is what you do.<br>  you probably have your numbers saved to your phone. you need to save/move them onto your sim card. <br>  it would help to know what kind of phone you have, to better answer your question. but if you cant do this, go to a ATT store. they should be able to fix it....|`|qWicVoU9aa	Your numbers are saved on the device and not on the SIM card.

You can switch them to the SIM card, but without full use of the screen it might be REALLY hard!<br>  <br>  My advice is to go into an AT&T dealer and they should have a machine where as long as the phones still working they can plug it in and pull all the numbers off and put them on the new one. <br>  <br>  hope this helps

Cl8FwsI2aa	Xbox 360. No contest.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	If I had a dollar for every time this question is asked, I would have $20 000<br>  <br>  Why you should get a PS3 and NOT a Xbox 360<br>  <br>  The *expected* lifetimes of current home video game consoles:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360--2005-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Wii-2006-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Playstation 3-2015 (Sony said they made it to last 10 years, so 2006+10 years=2016, round it down just to be safe), you'll get 7 years out of it.<br>  <br>  In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future and it has over-the-top graphical capabilities (google “Heavy Rain”). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:<br>  <br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet<br>  -Free online service<br>  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time, 128 VS 128)<br>  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser<br>  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive<br>  -HDMI 1.3, Xbox 360 only has HDMI 1.2 (major difference despite only a 0.1 difference)<br>  <br>  With the Xbox 360, you get:<br>  -DVD Player/upconverter<br>  -Xbox live, which is $50/year, and not even worth it<br>  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (that’s a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)<br>  -Umm…can’t really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories. 120GB for $150? With the PS3, you can upgrade to 500GB for $110!<br>  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")<br>  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 12th!<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console $400<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do<br>  Total: $517 ($2 USB mini cable)<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Play and Charge kit x2 $60 (for 2 controllers)<br>  Xbox Live $60<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $640<br>  <br>  That’s not cheaper, so get a grip on it! The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look the same, if not better on the PS3. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  Xbox Live VS PSN? The only thing you are missing is cross voice chat, which can easily be solved by using a telephone, or even in PSN’s V3.00 update, which we will be seeing soon enough.<br>  <br>  The PS3 has sold 21 million units in 2 years. The Xbox 360 has sold 28 million in 3 years. Plus a 33% failure rate, that means that 9.24 million units are either refurbished ones or replacements. So really, the amount of one-time buyers is about 19 million. So really, the PS3 has sold 21 million in 2 years, while the Xbox 360 has sold 19 in 3 years, and the PS3 has a higher face value ($199.99 vs. $399.99)<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, the PS3 is better—you get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer—legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  --PS3 expert--|`|VcNHahtgaa	PROS:<br>  PS3 -<br>  1.

After that, you have to buy a recharger for your controller which costs about $30-40 for only 1 controller.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 also had this thing called "RROD" which will break your Xbox 360 and you have to send it to Microsoft for them to fix it. It takes about 3-4 weeks for them to fix it. The RROD happens in about 33% of all 360's and it happens from overheating, which means playing it too long. The PS3 only had 0.2% chance of breaking.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Exclusives that Xbox 360 lost to PS3:<br>  <br>  1) Lost Planet<br>  2) Bioshock<br>  3) Saint's Row 2<br>  4) Condemned 2<br>  5) Vampire Rain<br>  6) Haze<br>  7) FEAR<br>  8) Oblivion<br>  9) Two Worlds<br>  10) Sacred 2<br>  11) Overlord<br>  12) ArmA 2<br>  13) Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII<br>  14) Enchanted ARMS<br>  15) Eternal Sonata<br>  16) Enemy Territory: Quake War<br>  17) TimeShift<br>  18) Kingdom Under Fire 2<br>  19) Doom 4<br>  20) Omikron 2<br>  21) Postal 3<br>  22) Unreal Tournament<br>  23) Ninja Gaiden<br>  24) Dead Rising<br>  25) Left 4 Dead<br>  26) Mass Effect 1 & 2|`|jxpV13rTaa	PS3 <br>  -one of the best blu ray players on the market (if not THE best)<br>  -free online play<br>  -rechargeable controllers<br>  -VERY reliable and durable<br>  -will have more games than the 360 at the end of 2009 (with bigger and better titles)<br>  -online play is great<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -game discs are blue ray (which makes better graphics than the 360)<br>  -only 0.2% defective rate after opened from box<br>  -won best console of 2008<br>  <br>  360<br>  -larger online community<br>  -online costs money to use<br>  -30% defective rate after opened from box (yes, 30!)<br>  -breaks down and creates the ring of death (scoaring of the discs until they arent readable)<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -has HD DVD player (which is obsolete and useless because they only make Blu Ray DVDs, not HD DVDs.)<br>  <br>  Dont waste your time with an xbox they will just break. i have owned both for a long time and the PS3 is by far the better choice. so its 100 dollars more...big deal. you get a larger hard drive and an amazing blu ray player. dont listen to bias people. you will get xbox lovers saying how the ps3 is junk. they are beyond ignorant. they are both amazing but the ps3 triumphs.|`|pOi0wewIaa	PS3|`|pl2SocVKaa	ps3|`|YhdfaEJVaa	Oh I've answered this so many times, <br>  <br>  First off. Lets talk about blu ray cause I know everyone says it. The blu ray discs alone make the system better because it allows game designers to make long more detailed games. When data has to be compressed you sometimes lose sound quality, picture.  The blu ray disc is able to hold 50gb or more dvd can hold like 8. <br>  <br>  So what that means is more room on disc, more details, more ability to do different things because the designers don't have to cut anything out.  I think you get the point.<br>  <br>  Now lets move onto  the "cell" processor<br>  It has the ability to do what 8 cpu processors do. And it is no bigger then a 1/4 of your thumb you don't believe me look it up.<br>  <br>  Then lets move onto features. The PSN "playstation network" it is totally free all you need is an internet service provider.<br>  And they are getting to thepoint where they have plenty of space and servers are super steady even in peak hours. <br>  <br>  There also the fact that a ps3 has less then 1% failure rate while a 360 has 33<br>  times that rate. So basically 1/3 the time it messes up and gets the RROD. <br>  <br>  Not to mention that developers haven't even been able to match capabilities of the ps3 and the 360 is nears it max point in ability. <br>  <br>  Ps3<br>  Has it all. Blu ray. Top technology, ability to adapt to future, free online play. The 360 doesn't have best graphics, can't even get the hardware issues alone straight how can they be better. Look @ vista. They scrapped it for OS7. <br>  Hands down ps3<br>  And anyone who say O gears of war....yeah its good but gets boring quick very short game, and halo? Come on. How many are the gonna make with same gameplay. Whenever they make new Xbox you'll end up playing halo 7!!!!<br>  I've played my ps3 on a SD tv and loved it so much I went and bought 120Hz 46" Samsung and its like I've never seen before. <br>  <br>  Ps3 is best. The hardware alone out does the 360.|`|ptG1gb42aa	XBOX360 all that guy said were lies!!!!

So unlike the iphone there are no service plans associated to the ipod touch.<br>  <br>  The only method the ipod touch has for connecting to the internet is wifi. You can access the internet with the ipod touch anywhere you have access to a wifi connection. So no, you don't have to pay anything extra for Internet access on the ipod touch, just for the same Internet Access you probably have at home for your computer anyway. <br>  <br>  However keep in mind you won't have internet access on the iphone when you're out and about unless you can find an open wifi network. OR pay for a hot spot service.|`|SykKZrIPaa	About Ipod touch can be read in <a href="http://news-blog-yahoo.blogspot.com/?q=Ipod%20touch" rel="nofollow">http://news-blog-yahoo.blogspot.com/?q=I...</a>|`|eXI7ba66aa	ipod touch only uses wi-fi so internet for the ipod touch is only free if you have a wireless connection

w7Ffw6MYaa	I would have to say the Lg Vu. Why? Because LG is a much better brand and its full touch-screen. It gets a lot of good reviews. Its also the first AT&T phone to support live TV with MediaFLO. It has a large screen and a good camera with many featues. <br>  <br>  The Matrix, sadly has gotten many negative reviews. It has a structural flaw, its sliding mechanism is plastic and cheap, making it difficult to use. I would get the VU, LG is a good phone manufacturer, and they make good quality phones (not like Pantech who uses a lot of plastic).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|QUIZ9Fqxaa	Erm I don't know about the LG Vu, but the Matrix has a pretty bad reputation of it breaking off its slider into halves and screen cracking.

IoKjLtN9aa	Okay I don't think you are using the right software, apple made some updates to the new iPod touches that make them harder to jail break. I'm giving you a link because the process of jail breaking the new iPod's is very hard, I'm going to warn you it's not for the the faint of heart. I can't stress hard enough it is rather complicated.

Xxviy63Paa	First let me dispel some illusions that go with conventional wisdom about online gaming.<br>  <br>  1) it's about bandwidth. This is very misleading.  Even the most  high-traffic games rarely see more than 100kbits/s download bandwidth per client. For a typical online 3d game, you will download 60kbits and upload 10kbits, barely more than a dial-up line. You might have a 20Mbit download line, or 5 Mbit, or 1Mbit, or even 256kbits basic dsl. It doesn't matter. As long as there isn't something else eating up your download bandwidth, you will get the same performance from each if ping is the same.<br>  <br>  Upload bandwidth does matter, but only if you're hosting. If you host, you need on average 60kbits/s. In the worst case scenario mentioned above you'd need 1Mbit upload to run a server hosting 10 people. For most games, 896k upload will host 12 people on a server.<br>  <br>  2) lag is caused by bad player bandwidth. No, it's not.  If you have bad bandwidth, it might cause lag, but for the above reasons, you are rarely going to exceed your bandwidth as a client on a game server. <br>     It's really caused by bad bandwidth on the server end. A good server admin sets a player limit to prevent this, and kicks people who ping too high. Also if there's only one or two people with high ping, it's not going to cause lag on a good server. Maybe on a server with bad upload. A good server can host players lag-free with them pinging up to 250 or more, if the game is modern and well-made.<br>  <br>  Now even though you can still play without lag with high ping, ping is still the most important thing to good online gaming. You need those precious milliseconds to get the drop on your opponents.  Second is upload bandwidth. Finally don't worry about the download, not for gaming anyway. You won't need more than 256 for that, though you'll probably want more for other reasons.<br>  <br>  ISP's advertise the least important thing for gaming most, they rarely advertise upload bandwidth up front, and they never mention ping. Get a line with at least 896kbits up if you want to host rooms. As for your main question, which one has better ping varies by company and area, but usually they will be roughly the same in any given place. What matters most is how far your house is from the fiber-optic "backbones," the high-speed mainlines that the internet is built on. Generally, city=good, rural=bad, and east=good, west=bad except southern cal. The only way to find out how a provider pings in a particular area is to ask people who live there and use them. The company will never tell you, or they'll just lie.<br>  <br>  I use QWest DSL, it doesn't ping so great but nobody does here in the pacific northwest. It beats the cable company though. Comcast is terrible and a rip-off besides.|`|XqvksbhTaa	Although cable is much better for gaming, DSL will also work.<br>  <br>  If in addition to gaming you do a lot of downloading, video watching, etc, then I would suggest sticking with cable. The increased bandwidth is worth it when it comes to download speed and video buffers.<br>  <br>  Really it comes down to how badly you're wanting to ditch Charter. Switching to DSL will result in a loss of bandwidth and ping but this may not even be noticeable depending on which game(s) you're playing.|`|9Djep77Vaa	I can tell you from a lot of personal experience, cable works A LOT better than DSL. You get better bandwidth and it is way more reliable with much less lag issues. If you ever have a choice get anything better than DSL. Hope this helps!

4Pk6VNftaa	The better way of doing this is to buy a router.<br>  <br>  The router has 1 port for your modem, and then 4 or 5 ports for things like your PC, 360, other stuff.  This way all your devices can share the internet at the same time.  Most routers also support wireless, so if you have a laptop, it can connect to the router (and internet) this way as well.<br>  <br>  Routers generally run about $30-40.|`|Z0odTlyQaa	Yes.<br>  Right now it sounds like you can only use one at a time (Xbox or PC). If you want to use both at the same time, you need to get a router. You plug the modem into the router, and then hook the Xbox and computer into the router too.
hplJxGa2aa	It is possible, but takes a LOT of work and money. What your going to have to do is to buy a bunch of blank cd's (depending on how many songs that you downloaded). Each cd can hold about 15 songs. So do the math yourself. Then, you'll have to burn all of your songs on to the cds from iTunes. After that, you'll have to import all of the songs into Windows Media Player. Then you can sync the MP3 player to Windows Media Player. HOWEVER, I am pretty sure that doing that is illegal. So your pretty much screwed, unless you want to break the law.<br>  <br>  <br>  UPDATE: Also, no you can not get a refund on your music if you bought it from iTunes. You will never get a refund, either.

Not many people know about this phone yet, but its called the Kyocera X-TC and it will be $100 and should be on shelves by March.

IDTFO7kuaa	DirecTv.  It offers more HD channels than cable and has better customer support.|`|drUEpl73aa	comcast they are the best|`|NGSax7ejaa	Your Answer:<br>  DIRECTV!<br>  I reasearched all and used both DirecTV and Dish for years. Most recently i was with Dish for about 8 years. Both are basically the same with programming offerings, but here are a few important differences to me. <br>  1. DirecTV uses only one roof satellite receiver for local channels. Dish, in areas, requires two dish satellite receivers on the roof to receive local channels. I tried for years, purchasing three TV antennae, to get reliable local TV reception; to no avail. I could not get the Dish second roof top receiver because of my neighbor’s trees.<br>  2. DirecTV includes local channels in their price. You pay extra with Dish.<br>  3. DirecTV HD DVR will record two HD channels at once. Dish records two channels at once, but only one is HD.<br>  4. DirecTV receiver stays on if you leave it on. If the Dish receiver is left on, the picture is replaced in the middle of the night with an annoying Dish logo on the screen. So, if you want to record a Dish recorded program to your VCR or DVD during that period, your program is replaced with the Dish logo.<br>  5. DirecTV has at least two weeks of programming information on their system. Dish programming is limited to one week. <br>  6. DirecTV DVR has output options for HDMI, component and two analog AV outputs that operate simultaneously. Dish has HDMI, component and one analog.<br>  7. Both are good for offering a lot of sports selections from across the country. DirecTV is suppose to be better for sports fans (I am not), and offers special spotrs packages - of course at extra cost<br>  8. Definitly do not go with Dish. Dish has a policy, as I unfortunately discovered, that destroys your personal property if you mistakenly return your expensive DVD/hard drive recorder instead of their receiver. Both were out of my media tower and looked almost the same, and I just hastily grabbed the wrong one. They just destroyed it, without any notification, or giving me any opportunity to even pay for it's return. I noticed their receiver, a week after the mistake, but they had already destroyed my equipment. They have consistently, and adamantly refused to compensate me. Yet, I returned their receiver, or my credit card would have been charged. I have No recourse. I certainly would not trust such a company that treats people this way!

syC3uQpjaa	Make a Movie<br>  Do you like making movies, including home movies, but have a problem doing a suitable job with it? Do you get frustrated at working hard and taking precious time, but then finding your movies totally bogus? Here's a few tips on making a spectacular film, with working on your editing, camera movements, story line, characters, scenes, and more. It will guarantee, no doubt, a movie fit for Hollywood. the information or story, it will be apparent to your audience.<br>  <br>  Write the script/screenplay. If you want to submit your script to a professional, screenplays need to be in a special formats. If you're simply filming the movie yourself you can write it like a play script. Your screenplay should detail every scene, all actions performed by the characters, the settings/locations, and when each scenes changes. <br>  Make storyboards and a shot list from your script. Planning what shots you want to film will make the shoot go smoother. <br>  Cast your film (Find actors). People in your community might work for screen credits in low budget films. Of course, it would be advantageous to have a well-known name starring in your movie. <br>  Location Scout: find a place and decide on the time to shoot it! Home movies will be relatively spontaneous, but structured films should have a schedule so your cast and crew know when and where to gather. <br>  If you can't find the right location you can create sets. You can use wood and paint for very simple set modifications. (If possible, using actual locations is easier. It's simpler to film in a diner than make a room look like one.) <br>  Before your scheduled shoot, get (and test) your equipment. You will need a video camera and tripod, additional microphones, lighting equipment, and spare tapes/discs. <br>  Pick out some costumes and makeup for your actors, if needed. <br>  Film your movie. The shots you decide to take will make the difference between a "home movie" or a professional looking movie. Some people say to shoot multiple takes from multiple angles because it will be more interesting in the end. As a very general rule, professional filmmakers shoot each scene in a wide shot, medium shot and close up of important elements. And the type of shots they decide to take are determined by what feeling or emotion they are trying to convey. <br>  Take your footage to your computer - upload the stuff you shot, and edit it. Cut out the boring parts, that's what movies are all about. Quick cuts, hold viewer's interest. Editing between various angles can quickly show multiple things going on in the same scene. Use your editing system's split or razor tool to create smaller clips from multiple shots, and then mix and match. You'll get the hang of it. <br>  Add sound effect and music. Make sure that your music flows with what is going on the movie at that second. Music gives the movie an emotional stance. It changes the audience's emotions which give them a more positive view on your film. You can vary in your music, either to make the audience, happy, sad, angry, scared, excited, emotional, and more. <br>  Create titles and credits for your actors and crew. You can also include a list of "thank you's" to any organizations that were willing to let you shoot in their establishments. <br>  Export to a digital format or burn to a DVD.|`|TaxYLHbMaa	you will need the divx converter , axxo video's are avi format which are the xvid equivalent or extension change . divx converter will convert the format to a divx extension , allowing it to be moved to editing programs without the compression on the audio being changed

Then they have software to let you schedule recordings.  Then there are products that let you stream video to your TV from your computer.<br>  <br>  You can bypass all the complexity by just plugging an antenna into your TV and letting it scan for available channels.<br>  <br>  You can see what TV stations are around you that offer free over-the-air signals by typing your address into the website below.

p11sk9qhaa	You can use iDump to load the music from you iPod to your computer and resync it. iDump can be found at the first link. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to fool with iTunes check the second link. It was written in 2007 though.|`|jWHGmFDXaa	This is from another person's answer, I used this when my computer crashed and I was able to reload all my songs back onto my computer.<br>  <br>  STEP 1:<br>  - Plug in your iPod. iTunes should open up. If not, then open it how you normally open. Wait until it connects with the iPod.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 2:<br>  - A message will pop up and ask if you want to erase this iPod and sync with the iTunes library (or sometimes it asks if you want to transfer your music). Click Cancel.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 3:<br>  - Make sure you are on the iPod Options page (your iPod should pop up under Devices; click on it). Make sure the box that says "Enable disk use" is CHECKED.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 4:<br>  - Exit iTunes. Don't eject it, though.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 5:<br>  - Go to your iTunes music folders. (It's usually located in Start > My Documents > My Music > iTunes.) Delete the XML and ITL files.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 6:<br>  - Go to Start > My Computer. Then click on Tools > Folder Options > the "View" tab. In Advanced Settings (under Files and Folders) click "Show hidden files and folders". Then click OK.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 7:<br>  - Go to Start > My Computer. Click on your iPod (for instance, mine says "VICKY'S IPOD (:F)". See the slightly see-through iPod_Control folder? Right click on it and scroll down to "Send to ... " and pick My Documents. NOTE: You can save it anywhere on your computer, but to make it easy I'm just going to pick a spot for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 8:<br>  - It will take a few minutes to copy everything. When it's done, unhide the iPod_Control folder that you just copied to My Documents (NOT the iPod_Control that is on your iPod!) by right-clicking on it. Scroll down to Properties. Then uncheck the Hidden attribute. A message will pop up and ask if you want to apply this to this folder, subfolders, and files. Make sure this option is chosen, and click OK. (You MUST do this step.)<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 8:<br>  - Open iTunes. Remember that your iPod is still connected to the computer. You will get the same messages asking if you want to erase this iPod and sync it with the iTunes library, unless you chose "Do not ask me again". Click Cancel.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 9:<br>  - At the top, click on Edit > Preferences. Choose the "Advanced" tab. Make sure "Keep iTunes Music folder organized" and "Copy files to iTunes Music folder when adding to library" are checked.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 10:<br>  - From iTunes, choose File (at the top) > Add Folder to Library. Navigate to the iPod_Control folder and click OK.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 11:<br>  - The files will begin to copy into your iTunes library. You might want to take this time to write down all your playlists, because when you sync your iPod again you'll lose them.<br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 12:<br>  - After your library fills up, simply click on your iPod under Devices and sync it! It will ask if you want to erase the songs and sync. Just click Yes. It doesn't matter now because all of your songs are on your computer.|`|bC5OAfs5aa	Try setting your iPod to manually manage music;<br>  <br>  Or use an iPod transfer program to transfer all music on your iPod back to computer and iTunes.

05uraLcQaa	from my understanding you shouldnt be able to use any altell phones with verizon service and vice versa. normaly when 2 companies merge (like suncom and cingular back in the day and Nextel/Sprint) they will offer you new customer pricing if you switch from the older company to the newer one. if you are on alltel then ask a verizon rep about what benefits you get from switching to Verizon service, you might be able to buy a new Chocolate with the new plan at the cheapest rate.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|XbjwbzcUaa	You can place a Verizon phone on a Non-Divested Alltel account. You just cannot go into an Alltel store and do this, because it says Verizon on the phone. You have to change the equiptment on your My Account at alltel.com. All you do is log into your account there, and select the phone you want to change to the chocolate, and then select change my equiptment. <br>  <br>  We've done this with our employee tech lines with the Blackberry Storms because we're very impatient employees.

You should go to one of the SM Malls that has that cause there are a ton of shops there for Mobile Phones (unlocked), Computer Parts, etc.  But you wouldn't really get the latest trend of Computer Parts there,  what I recommend is going to Gilmore avenue (near Aurora and the LRT Station and also north of Greenhills) to get the latest computer parts.    There is also a level of gaget stores in V-Mall (also called 'Viramall') in Greenhills (level 3 opposite of the food court).

771a432239749c75069cce288603b99eaa	There are variuous ways of doing this (a) By Bluetooth (U need ur pc equipped with bluetooth) (b) by direct card transfer (Card reader on pc needed  or (c) Data cable (USB)<br>  <br>  Either way d/load the file u wana transfer, with bluetooth simply use ur bluetooth software to send the file over to ur fone and it will automatically store it in the place it needs to be. If ur use the card option then once u put ur card into th pc reader then its just a case of drag and drop, the relevent folders shud be well indicated. The more popular choice wud be by usb cable, now dont forget to install the software for the fone BEFORE u attach ur usb cable. Then install ur pc suite on ur pc run it and attach ur cable and it shud let u transfer whatever file u want and it will put it wherever it needs to . Hope this helps

j4erzRM2aa	i would not recommend you to get this phone. LG make phones that look really good, but dont really function that well. Samsung and Motorola are much more reliable manufacturers.<br>  <br>  to find actual user reviews, i would recommned this site: yourmobilephonereviews.com (google it)|`|E5JaGlcbaa	while i generally WOULD not recommend owning an Lg phone... the same applies here. The scoop, costs around 100$ which is an unacceptable price. Most people get the phone to take advantage of the full qwerty keyboard and the marketable music stores, and mp3 abilities. but the fact is, if you're willing to pay 100$ for a cell phone, you might as well get the most bang for your buck, and this series of phones are not the best.  Recommended phones, and services. Omnia, and blackberry storm from verizon wireless. Storm = 199$ with 2 yr plan. omnia 99$ with 2 yr plan. both phones are smart phones, have full internet, high quality camers, (storm 3.2 mp) and (omnia 5 mp). these phones while a little more costly on the monthly bill are much more productive for the somewhat steep price
kL6amV8gaa	I owned the Storm and returned it for the Omnia.<br>  <br>  Omnia...Windows Mobile has more apps and the phone has more features. I took the Storm back because I hated it and got the Omnia. I hated the clicking screen and the fact that I could only switch from landscape to portrait on certain screens while running certain apps. The Omnia allows you to transition the screen when ever you want with just the turn of the phone...u could be sending a text, making a call or browsing the internet...it doesn't matter. Also the Blackberry is very laggy in it's transition from landscape to portrait and vice versa. The Omnia will only give you that problem when your running a lot of programs...and it does take alot of programs to make the transition laggy. I would go with the Omnia. The Omnia is verizon's best selling phone as of now and the Storm is the most commonly returned phone...that's what the VZW Rep told me when I returned my BB and switched to teh Omnia.|`|zJR4uj0Laa	storm i have had all of the blackberry phones and nevr had problems with them but my cusin ahs the samsung instinct and the battery life sucks and the singnals bad so i think storm|`|AA10421331	Well i can't give a sturdy reason but i've been researching the topic myself as well.<br>  <br>  As i can see the keyboards on both are a bit lacking they both either have there glitches, or are laggy and u press the the keys to many times or you mess up in your spelling. The blackberry storm seems to have a better response at fixing these mistakes on the other hand the Omnia has windows running on it and has a better dictionary and spelling checker on it. I'd have to give the keyboard win to the strom just because of the interface (when it doesn't crash)<br>  <br>  The touch screens are comparable and can't be compared to much but the omnia seems to be smoother and is more sensitive. The devices to click are not the same however. On the omnia you do have a tracker ball and when pressed and moved a arrow similar to that of a windows cursor appears so you can click those smaller icons and can make things a bit easier. On the other hand the storm is bigger and the icon are a bit bigger so you can more easily click them. Overall i'd have to give the touch screen "battle" to the storm because of it's size and icon sizes. But if your used to the tracker balls and are new to the touch screens go with the Omnia.<br>  <br>  Software, Out of the box the Omnia was and still is slightly better but the storm is getting better and will have more updates to fix it. The omnia will probally stay on top of the software market tho with just all the abilities accessing a home or work computer. Or just overall reliability, but i do have to give the storm the chance of being able to be one of the best phones when the updates come out and it doesn't crash.<br>  <br>  Accelerometer, The omnia wins hands down with being faster and more responsive.<br>  <br>  Overall it depends on your needs for the phone for a person like myself someone who just texts a lot and loves to mess around with his phone the blackberry wins. But if the phone is needed for work the omnia is your best bet, with all windows applications pre-uploaded working with powerpoint and windows and excel is much easier.

771a432239749c75069cce288603b99eaa	ok get ur one and make sure ur bluetooth is on, Then press and hold the jabra headset till u see the light flash, once it flashes search for bluetooth devices with ur 95, it will show up on the list and select it, if it asks for a pairing code enter 0000, then u will notice that the flash sequence will change and that on ur main screen of ur fone a headset symbol will appear, that will mean that it is setup. Now for ease of use what i tend to do is go back into the luetooth settings and view the device list, select the headset and click options, if ur select "authorise" this will allow ur fone to auto connect as soon as u set the headset for connection. no codes or faffing round in the future. Hope this helps ya :)

I guess there is a possibility and I could be wrong but I am pretty sure it doesn't. Since Verizon uses CDMA and T-Mobile uses GSM you can't transfer phones between them.

o32vB5QHaa	I have tried out ALL of the Sprint phones. Personally, out of the ones you listed above, I would choose the Rant. The Rant is very durable and has a great fully qwerty keyboard. It is much better quality than the Rumor in terms of durability, plus I think it looks better. It comes in Black, Purple and Red. The HTC Touch pro is iffy. There have been a lot of network issues with the phone. I do think it has a lot to offer, it just needs to the all the bugs worked out of it. You are also required to have the $30/month data plan on this phone as well. I am not a huge fan of the lotus, although it has said to be one of the best texting phones. We make fun of it and call it the clam phone. Haha. So I'd say go with the Rant, but that's just based on personal use :D...The Instinct is also very cool, not on your list, but texting is awesome on it for a touch phone. It even comes in Pink now...

It's a cool, non-affiliate, site where you can tell how far you are from the signals, terrain and a lot of stuff.<br>  Then, go to my blog, below, where I've found the best antennas for the money whether you need  a close range, medium range or long range antenna.<br>  Oh, and interferences play a part in reception with HDTV.  Besides the obvious of trees, buildings hills, metal siding and roofs can be a problem too.|`|s7Muujxzaa	Take a look at this and put your address in.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/maps/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/maps/</a><br>  <br>  Now take a look at a place like Channel Master at <a href="http://www.channelmasterintl.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelmasterintl.com/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  and compare the antenna they suggest with what you have. You are in a rather rough area, reception wise and you probably will need a better antenna with an amplifier to get the max number of stations.

So i turned it in and went back to VZW. I got the omnia and I've been very happy. Amazing camera, fast internet, good battery life(lasts all day even though I'm constantly talking or online). There's more features than there are stars in the sky...lol. 5mp camera, the screen allows you to rotate the phone and transition from portrait to landscape ANYTIME not like most other phones that only allow u to do this when running certain applications, TV Out...yes u can actually run a line to your TV and output your video to your TV, optical mouse...this phone has an optical mouse incase u don't want to use the stylus, Windows Mobile, Mobile Office, Wifi...there is so much more! I would definitely recommend it. I have nothing but good things to say about it.<br>  <br>  Possible cons, sometimes don't get service in big buildings(a common problem with most phones) but Wifi allows you to still use the internet in large buildings.

HBNx77BBaa	You don't say which model so I can't refer to a manual. If the images are completely red, with no other colors showing at all then that is either an effect that you have accidentally selected or a fault with the camera.<br>  <br>  If you are only seeing the effect in room lighting without flash then that is just the color that the lighting really is. Our eyes adapt. You can get the color to look better by changing the white balance setting manually in your camera menu. Make sure you change it back to auto when you're done otherwise your daylight pictures will look very blue.

RpCwfcRzaa	The cheapest is a straight Ethernet connection from your 360 to your modem or router. The Pro and Elite come with an Ethernet cable, but you'll probably have to buy a longer one to make it reach. You can get them at any store that sells computer stuff and they're usually under $20. Just make sure it's Cat 5, 6, or 5e. Run it along the baseboard so it's out of the way.

You can buy an ethernet cable of over fifty feet for a few bucks at say a Best Buy or Circuit City.|`|iVCKOQbVaa	Alright.

You have to go to Network Connections on your computer. 1. connect one end of a  ethernet cable to the XBox and the other end to the ethernet port of the PC.<br>  <br>  4. Now switch on the XBox. <br>  <br>  5. On the PC: Go to Start and click on Control Panel. Then click on Network and Internet Connections. Then click Network Connections. <br>  <br>  6. Right click on Wirless Network Connection. Click properties. On the new window, click on the Advanced tab located on the top of the window. Now select the option to Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection. <br>  <br>  9. Now click on OK. Oh and you need to disable your firewall.

U can use a third party apps to extract songs and videos out of the iPod onto the new computer. Add them to the iTunes library and add new songs if u want.
0PQdeKzaaa	Hi i live in the south east & i didnt have any problems with the reception when i was with "3" the reason i left there network was the unhelpfulness of the customer service & even the idiotic staff in my local "3" store couldnt answer a simple question that i asked them so "3" lost my custom & vodafone won me over with there weekend offers ! what i would say do is go to the "3" website & see what the map says for the reception in your area if it says its a good reception & your not getting the reception you should then complain to "3" themselves & also it may be just aswell going to offtel which is like the trading standards for telecomunications after all as your paying to use there service you should be getting what you pay for ... hope this helps|`|aqvQLsMMaa	lol alan carr whines bout tht just crap in uk everyone ii know whoo has it has proper rubbish connection

It's free, but takes a couple of weeks to arrive. That way, you'll have all your profiles, saves, downloads, etc. moved to your new console. <br>  It also cleans out the old hard disk so when you give your Pro to your brother, he'll have all the free space.<br>  <br>  Every Xbox lets you create 3-4 profiles with a free month of Gold, so he might be able to create a profile on the Pro (depending on how many profiles you've already created), or you can let him create a profile on your new Elite and then do a "Recover Gamertag" on the Pro -- <a href="http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/xboxlive/playxboxlive/accountroamingandrecovery/recoveryourgamertag.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nx...</a>

IoKjLtN9aa	There are a few unlucky people who do get viruses from aimini.net although it's not too common. My honest suggestion would be to try pandora. It's an online radio that ask you what kind of artist and music you like, and then they play songs that are similar to your taste in music. You can't download them but hey it's still nice! Completely free and safe too!|`|Q0dzzgomaa	No! Wait and consider this first.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Sharing<br>  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)<br>  <br>  2) Preview before you play<br>  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well. <br>  <br>  3) Virus Risks<br>  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for. <br>  <br>  4) Settings<br>  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:<br>  - Install<br>  - Select the folder<br>  - Select the quality<br>  - Download your songs<br>  <br>  5) Wider Variety of Music<br>  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.<br>  <br>  2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading<br>  <br>  3) No viruses.<br>  <br>  4) Preview before you play<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  <br>  Limewire:<br>  Pros:<br>  - You can download free music<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Everything else<br>  <br>  Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|JjBIDCKvaa	I have recently started using Aimimi, and I think it works great! But when I downloaded a certain song;; I ended up getting a huge virus, so BE CAREFUL (:

6GIrW5eWaa	time in market, game play, access to friends list, access to additional items in the market place. Teamed up with Netflix for additional services and online availability. Very easy menu to operate through. I have all three systems Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. The Xbox, in my opinion, is the easiest of the three and by far the most intuitive to navigate through. It has the most games available. Live is at a cost per month or annually but in my mind it is well worth it. <br>  <br>  One might say you get what you pay for, and you can expect more from a system that you are paying for an additional service. What I have heard, although I have not used it, is that the PS3 "Free" network is laggy and very difficult to use or find what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  I would thumbs down you again if I had the chance. Not a fanboy grow up kid :P haha. You speak gibberish the truth is something you know not.|`|NHtwUNWYaa	raiderha is retarded ps3 has no lag unless you have a bad connection or the host has a bad connection and if they do like in cod4 the match will automatically end the game so psn being laggy is bs.psn  also has over 1250 movies and shows to download many available in hd.as for the xmb  being very confusing that depends on the person.the only thing i like that xbl has that psn doesn't is the cross game chatting and the voice messages. other than that it the same $hit the same $hit|`|QroOULvPaa	xbox live was to beat the ps2 with the old xbox system.|`|0RCGy3OOaa	the online interaction with specific games is unrivaled due to ease of use, speed, and overall gameplay
NGSax7ejaa	DIRECTV!<br>  I reasearched all and used both DirecTV and Dish for years. Most recently i was with Dish for about 8 years. Both are basically the same with programming offerings, but here are a few important differences to me. <br>  1. DirecTV uses only one roof satellite receiver for local channels. Dish, in areas, requires two dish satellite receivers on the roof to receive local channels. I tried for years, purchasing three TV antennae, to get reliable local TV reception; to no avail. I could not get the Dish second roof top receiver because of my neighbor’s trees.<br>  2. DirecTV includes local channels in their price. You pay extra with Dish.<br>  3. DirecTV HD DVR will record two HD channels at once. Dish records two channels at once, but only one is HD.<br>  4. DirecTV receiver stays on if you leave it on. If the Dish receiver is left on, the picture is replaced in the middle of the night with an annoying Dish logo on the screen. So, if you want to record a Dish recorded program to your VCR or DVD during that period, your program is replaced with the Dish logo.<br>  5. DirecTV has at least two weeks of programming information on their system. Dish programming is limited to one week. <br>  6. DirecTV DVR has output options for HDMI, component and two analog AV outputs that operate simultaneously. Dish has HDMI, component and one analog.<br>  7. Both are good for offering a lot of sports selections from across the country. DirecTV is suppose to be better for sports fans (I am not), and offers special spotrs packages - of course at extra cost<br>  8. Definitly do not go with Dish. Dish has a policy, as I unfortunately discovered, that destroys your personal property if you mistakenly return your expensive DVD/hard drive recorder instead of their receiver. Both were out of my media tower and looked almost the same, and I just hastily grabbed the wrong one. They just destroyed it, without any notification, or giving me any opportunity to even pay for it's return. I noticed their receiver, a week after the mistake, but they had already destroyed my equipment. They have consistently, and adamantly refused to compensate me. Yet, I returned their receiver, or my credit card would have been charged. I have No recourse. I certainly would not trust such a company that treats people this way!|`|4lMM7UkFaa	direct tv <br>  cable freezez and dish network has bad quality|`|ce5DpjWqaa	well direct tv would be the better one if its satellite you want but overall verison is (in my opinion) best, it has best reviews and you can get football , and basketball games in florida and all over the us and a few other countrys. it also has alot more hd channels that anybody else so i think it would be better and also it gives full 1080p with local channels for news and other stuff.|`|14c690b99c03a819fd4f7cbcd14bac5eaa	I would go with DirecTV.  They have more HD channels than any cable company, and they have more than Dish Network too...
IzB0dfmSaa	To put it simply:<br>  <br>  The only Kirby games for the Wii are the Virtual Console games you download from the Wii Shop Channel; (which are the classic NES & SNES titles):<br>  NES: Kirby's Adventure = 500 Wii Points<br>  & SNES: Kirby's Dream Course, Kirby's Avalanche, & Kirby's Dream Land 3 = all each 800 Wii Points<br>  <br>  You download the games if your Wii has an internet connection; & if you input either your credit card information when downloading the titles off the Shop Channel; or inupting a Wii Points card code, when you buy a wii points card from retailers!!<br>  <br>  For the DS system, there are 3 Kirby games:<br>  the newest one is Kirby Super Star Ultra, which is an enchanced remake of the SNES classic with new modes and mini games!!<br>  The other 2 DS games are Kirby's Canvas Curse & Kirby's Squeak Squad!!<br>  <br>  Also there's only 1 GameCube Kirby game; a racing games called Kirby's Air Ride... not neccesarly a good game!! :(<br>  <br>  <br>  And there's the fact that Nintendo still hasn't given any real official news on development for a true Wii retail Kirby game... its kind of been on and off that's it still deep in development! Was announced as a GameCube port to the Wii way back in 2007 if I recal; & then dropped but was said to be still in production somewhere in 2008! So NO WORD as of yet; sorry... have to wait until Nintendo announces anything on their press site or at any conference or E309, or GDC which is March 23, 2009!!|`|DFwNXmDBaa	kirby 64|`|hwaTOBL7aa	there are rumors that there will be a kirby game on the wii.

1ow0CMBtaa	unless it says its an ms-dos game, it should work fine. xp has something called compatibility mode, where you can run any application in an environment that simulates old operating systems. if the game doesn't work at first, right click the .exe in its program files folder, go to properties, and one of the tabs should have an option to run in compatibility mode. check the box, and select windows 95 from the drop down menu. apply, ok, run it again. it should work.|`|Gi0jEqaSaa	it should just work on any kind of computer.

A progress bar will appear on the computer screen indicating that the first stage of the restore process has started. When this stage is completed, iTunes will instruct you to leave iPod connected to your computer to complete restore.<br>  7. During the stage 2 of the restore process, the iPod will show an Apple logo as well as a progress bar at the bottom of the display. It is critical that the iPod remains connected to the computer or iPod Power adapter during this stage. Note: The progress bar may be difficult to see since the backlight on the iPod display may be off.<br>  8.

You will be prompted with one or more restore options that may prompt iTunes to automatically download of the latest iPod Software. The 4 possible restore options are:<br>  Restore Option 1: Restore - Restores with same iPod Software version already on iPod.<br>  Restore Option 2: Use Same Version - Restores with same iPod Software version already on iPod, even though a newer version is available.<br>  Restore Option 3: Use Newest Version - Restores with latest iPod Software version on your computer.<br>  Restore Option 4: Restore and Update - Restores with latest iPod Software version on your computer.<br>  6. A message will appear prompting you to enter an administrator's name and password.<br>  7. A progress bar will appear on the computer screen indicating that the first stage of the restore process has started. When this stage is completed, iTunes will instruct you to leave iPod connected to your computer to complete restore.<br>  8. During the stage 2 of the restore process, the iPod will show an Apple logo as well as a progress bar at the bottom of the display. It is critical that the iPod remains connected to the computer or iPod Power adapter during this stage. Note: The progress bar may be difficult to see since the backlight on the iPod display may be off.<br>  9. After stage 2 of the restore process is complete and the iPod is connected to the computer, the iTunes Setup Assistant window will appear asking you to name your iPod and choose your syncing preferences similar to when you connected your iPod for the first time.

The only exception is this unit made by Motorola that incorporates a cable box, DVD player, and  surround receiver.<br>  <br>  The boxes do have a unit address/serial number that needs added to your account at least. That U/A can tell them all the history of the box they need to know.<br>  <br>  It is highly recommended you not buy boxes from eBay or other questionable or unauthorized sources.  Being Comcast does not sell boxes at all, there is no official authorized place to legitimately purchase a cable box to use on Comcast, at least until the cablecard box market picks up.

The plastic covers on cell phones are fairly tight, but water can enter the phone in a short period of time, perhaps only 20 seconds or less. So grab your phone quickly! If you can't get to it in time, your best bet is to remove the battery while it is still under water. Water helps dissipate heat from shorts that can damage the phone, so most damage occurs when the inside of the phone is merely wet and there is a power source. <br>  Remove the battery. This is one of the most important steps. Don't take time to think about it; electricity and water do not mix. Cutting power to your phone is a crucial first step in saving it. Many circuits inside the phone will survive immersion in water provided they are not attached to a power source when wet. <br>  If you have a GSM carrier, remove your SIM card. Some or all of your valuable contacts (along with other data) could be stored on your SIM. To some people this could be more worth saving than the phone itself. SIM cards survive water damage well, but some of the following steps are unnecessary i.e. don't heat it. Just pat it dry and leave it aside until you need to connect your phone to your cellular network. (This step does not apply to CDMA carriers such as Verizon, Alltel, US Cellular, Sprint, etc.) <br>  Dry your phone. Obviously you need to remove as much of the water as soon as possible, so you can save it from getting into the phone. Shake it out without dropping it, then use a towel or paper towel (ideally trying not to clog the wet paper in the gaps and grooves of the phone) to gently remove as much of the remaining water as possible. Dry the excess moisture by hand. <br>  Remove any covers and external connectors to open up as many gaps, slots, and crevices in the phone as possible. <br>  Use a vacuum cleaner if possible. Do not use a hair dryer (even on a "cold" mode) to dry out the phone, as this may force moisture further into the small components, deep inside the phone. If moisture is driven deeper inside, corrosion and oxidation may result when minerals from liquids are deposited on the circuitry. Using a hairdryer might be a temporary fix, but this will eventually cause component failure inside the phone. Instead, remove all residual moisture by drawing it away with a vacuum cleaner held over the affected areas for up to 20 minutes in each accessible area. This is the fastest method and can completely dry out your phone and get it working in thirty minutes. Be careful not to hold the vacuum too close to the phone, as a vacuum can create static electricity, which is even worse. <br>  Use a substance with a high affinity for water to help draw out moisture. Leave the phone in a bowl or bag of uncooked rice overnight. The rice would absorb any remaining moisture. If available, it is preferable to use desiccant instead. Desiccant will absorb moisture better than rice. It may be found under a brand name such as "DRY-ALL" "Damp Rid" or "Dry Right". <br>  Let the phone sit on absorbent towels, napkin, or other paper. Remember that the goal is to evacuate all the moisture and humidity, not to trap it or add even more. Check the absorbent material every hour for 4 to 6 hours. If moisture is evident, repeat the vacuuming step and desiccant steps. <br>  Test your phone. After you have waited a day or so, make sure everything is clean and dry looking and re-attach the battery to the phone and see if it works. If your phone does not work, try plugging it into its charger without the battery, if this works, you need a new battery. If not, try taking your cell phone to an authorized dealer. Sometimes they can fix it. Don't try to hide the fact that it has been wet. There are internal indicators that prove moisture.|`|05uraLcQaa	if it is from a friend, and worked for them, it basically just depends on how she got her new one. the only way it can be flagged as lost or stolen is if they:<br>  <br>  1, used their insurance and put a claim in to get their new phone.<br>  a) if they claimed it as lost, it will be flagged,<br>  b) if they claimed it as stolen, it will be flagged<br>  <br>  thats the only way a phone can have a bad ESN if it came directly froma friend. if they found it somewhere, you can take it to a sprint store and ask them to do a service swap (swap your phone for the friends) and if its a bad ESN then it wont let them, nothing further can happen. <br>  <br>  if they were using the phone and upgraded to a new one, then the phone has no reason to have a bad ESN. <br>  <br>  if your still unsure, then take it to the store and ask for the service swap, it will either work, or it wont. <br>  <br>  one last thing, if it does have a bad ESN , its pretty much useless.
4cMuedpWaa	Yes, using your Wi-Fi at home is FREE of charge.<br>  <br>  Just to avoid data connection with your wireless carrier (been there, done that and heard it too many times from friends and customers), make sure that you go to your phone's wireless manager and turn off the phone connection and just leave the wi-fi on.<br>  <br>  This is because the phone uses your data connection in case it misses the Wi-Fi signal.

4cMuedpWaa	They all offer unlimited messaging in some specific plans (or as an add-on).<br>  <br>  If you want your kid to have a nice choice of good phones for now and in the future as well as one of the best networks, definitely AT&T.<br>  <br>  AT&T has a wide choice of phones that can suit your kid (boy or girl) with phones like:<br>  <br>  Nokia 6650<br>  Samsung A767 Propel<br>  Samsung A777<br>  Motorola Z9<br>  Motorola RAZR2 V9x<br>  <br>  just to name a few.<br>  <br>  Lately Sprint is not looking good economically as well as not a shiny choice of phones.<br>  <br>  Verizon choice of available phones is a disaster and the only 2 decent phones would be the Blackberry Storm (which would run you at least $199.99 when you sign the contract) or the HTC Touch Pro (which will kill you with its price tag of 349.99)<br>  <br>  The only other two I would recommend would be the Samsung Omnia and the Blackberry 8830.<br>  <br>  Considering that you're looking for an unlimited text messaging plan, for Verizon his/her best option would be the Blackberry 8830.|`|mC91jDUKaa	I would have to say that Sprint has the best price of plans.  There are a few good "teenager" phones out right now that they offer.  The LG Rumor & Samsung Rant are a couple to mention.<br>  <br>  My son has the Rant and loves it... he texts up a storm.<br>  <br>  We have a family plan with unlimited data (texting, email, web browsing) in our plan.  You can get a plan like this with a certain amount of minutes.  It's called Everything plan and there are different types.<br>  <br>  Not many other companies offer these type of plans.|`|qIvyjSkPaa	i personally enjoy verizon, which is what i have now. i get good reception and i have an awesome plan that allows has unlimited messaging and i can use Vcast and go online. my friends who have sprint and at&t want to have verizon too.|`|wJMDRQFMaa	im in uk but i heared bad couvarage with att and sprint bad c/s and aint heared any thing bad about verz
w3KVtA2uaa	I don't have the same exact phone, but try this:<br>  1. Go to "Messaging"<br>  2. "Settings"<br>  3. See if you can locate something that says "Signature" and you should be able to change it.
z3ofeQXYaa	Verizon uses CDMA phones that don't have sim cards right now; which you probably know. However, perhaps by mid-2010 Verizon will start GSM based services like AT&T with their 4G network, called LTE.<br>  <br>  The plan that you're proposing is possible but may cause you more trouble than you think.<br>  <br>  If you purchase a “device with HTML capability” like the Samsung Omnia which is an amazing phone and would sell well on ebay; it would require you to add a data plan when you purchase it. So if you were planning to buy it and change back, you would have to cancel the data plan too.<br>  <br>  If you were going to buy a regular cell phone that didn't require the data plan like the LG Chocolate 3; you would have less of a headache going that route but less profit in means of selling it on Ebay.<br>  <br>  As long as the phone is 911/GPS enabled; it'll still be usable to the buyer. However, if this was a different case such as you "lost" your phone and collected on your warranty... I don't believe Verizon would activate that because it's basically like a stolen phone. (Plus it'll basically be insurance fraud.)<br>  <br>  Verizon will let you switchback; it's your phone, you paid for it. I'm not sure if they'll charge you for reactivating your phone though, you'll have to ask a Verizon employee.<br>  <br>  (Be careful about talking to some Verizon sales agents; make sure you confirm the information they give you. Sometimes they don't know the answer for certain and you end up paying for it at the end.)  <br>  <br>  With the economy going the way it is... it's understandable that everyone is trying to earn a little extra cash where ever they can. But sometimes it isn't worth the trouble at the end.<br>  <br>  Summary:<br>  Yes, you can.<br>  Yes, the phone will still be usable for the buyer.<br>  Yes, Verizon will let you switch back.<br>  Worth it? You have to decide.<br>  Confident? 90% - Verizon does like to change their policies often so no one can be 100% with them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|771a432239749c75069cce288603b99eaa	To my knowledge there is nothing stopping u doin this. Check ebay there are plenty of gud handsets that are brand new titled unwanted upgrade ! The account info is not held by the fone, more the sim card, so as long as ur card remains in ur phone then it shud work fine. If in the future ur asked about ur new fone just claim that u didnt like it and decided to revert to ur previous handset although i very much doubt that will happen. Hope it helps|`|qIvyjSkPaa	i doubt there is anything stopping you. just get the upgrade and then switch back to your old phone. i've gotten a new phone before and then switched back into my old one and still kept the new phone.

IoKjLtN9aa	iTunes currently does not have a plan like that. It is rumored they are working on it though. Don't know how long that will take. With iTunes you must purchase each song individually (For 69-1.29 cents, most songs are 99, this is new to the store), or you may buy the entire album for a reduced price. If you actually download quiet a bit of the free songs on Napster. Napster is probably the choice for you. I'm not sure of how much Napster's plans cost but I'm sure you'll be able to reason if Napster is better in your situation.|`|ogJyBSzDaa	which is CHEAPER? get the entire itunes library for FREE.<br>  with swagbucks, all you have to do is search (like google, ask, yahoo, etc,) and you win swagbucks. with these swagbucks, you redeem them for thousands of prizes, with one of them being an itunes gift card. the gift card code will be sent through the site, so you dont have to worry about shipping costs or giving your address. <br>  i saved you the trouble and got you the link to register:<br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=326422" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a><br>  just register first, then look around. its so easy and cool, and FREE.<br>  trust me its not a scam and it really works.

fvTL6vFpaa	I recently bought the Canon Powershot SX1 IS which I believe is not available in the US or at least not yet.  This camera is very similar to the SX10.  Basically the SX10 is what they call an advanced point and shoot (PnS) camera.  It can work well in full auto mode which does all the settings for you and lets you know when you need to use the flash.  The advantage of advanced PnS is they offer the capability of manual control setting.  So as you become more familiar with the fundamentals of exposure control you will have the opportunity to play with various settings this camera offers.  In short, this SX10 should be pretty easy for a beginner to use but also allows you to grow as you become more advanced in photography.  The only major downside to the SX10 compared to other PnS is the size.  This is not the type of camera you can put in your pocket.|`|uiIxxbzwaa	I have had the canon SX10is for a few weeks now. The only problems I have had are:  1. The manual isn't the easiest to understand.  2. I am having trouble adjusting the settings for indoor sports.  The everyday pictures are great.   I love the video recording! It's remarkably clear. It also has color swap and color accent. Both are really cool.   So if your taking general pictures it should work well.
V1O7N02saa	Yes you can. If you have a data plan you could use 3G (3G only) or EDGE or GPRS (3G & 2G) to access the internet. Though you would have to pay to access them.  Or if you can access another wi-fi signal that can work as well.
pX5qsHmvaa	I was kinda in the same boat of you - i opted for the polaroid spectra unlike land polaroid land cameras they are easier to use and also allow you to adjust the autofocus and other options to make the pictures look really artsy and cool...However its been a nightmare to find spectra or film that fits.  The film ive bought is either over exposed or super expensive eg: ￡1.50 per polaroid shot!  even on ebay they dont sell cheap!<br>  <br>  Id say the best option would be just to buy a polaroid 600- it doesnt have many features at all but you can buy film for it everywhere and at a more reasonable price.<br>  <br>  There is also the Fuji instax which looks pretty cool and is the only other instant film camera, they are also still producing film and so easier and cheaper to maintain and use.  The only reason i didnt buy a fuji was because i like the dreamy sort of image that a polaroid camera gives you where as the fuji gives you more of a digital image.<br>  <br>  Basically spectra=better picture but more difficult to find film, polaroid 600-easy and film available.<br>  <br>  If i was you id just ebay polaroid camera and see whats available for cheapest.  What ever camera (polaroid) you but they are all amazing so itd prob be best to buy according to how much film is available.|`|p11sk9qhaa	One thing you should know is that Polaroid has stopped making film for them.<br>  <br>  My understanding is that there is a group of loyal Polaroid users that are looking into buying the equipment used to make the film in hopes of keeping it alive.<br>  <br>  Update: Found the link for those loyal users. It's the fourth link. And I believe that Polaroid may license the technology out to third party manufacturers.|`|QKtsjg6jaa	i was actually on the hunt for a polaroid camera myself.  someone told me they got it from a cvs pharmacy, but when i went there they only had the paper not the camera.  since the film paper isnt being made anymore, you should call cvs and see if they still have them.  i looked online and there was this supermarket kinda store that apparently sold polaroids but the website was kinda fishy and i dont think it was reliable.  there are some people that are selling there used polaroids.  check craigs list.  just google it and u should find some.  i found a lot on ebay i remember but they were overpriced (naturally).  u should also check froogle.com (its the shopping part of google).<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=used+polaroid+cameras&btnG=Google+Search&aq=0&oq=used+polaroid+" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=use...</a> <br>  go to that web page and look at the top listings that come up<br>  the ones that have a beige kinda box around them and then go to the websites below them that say "shopping results for used polaroid cameras" and have the prices right next to them.  click those links and just look around.  <br>  i think ur best bet is just going and looking on ebay, even though they are more expensive; but u said that ur an ebay expert so u shouldnt have any trouble finding some ;)<br>  as for what to look for, im also a layman in photography so i dont really know but u should call bel air camera in westwood close to in n out and urban outfitters, they're the camera experts|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	What to look for? Look for a Fuji,a Canon, a Nikon, an Olympus. That's what I'd look for. Get with the program. It's not even being made anymore.|`|lkqjJisaaa	Check out this link for information on Polaroid cameras and film, which will educate U as to the types of cameras that were made:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rwhirled.com/landlist/landhome.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rwhirled.com/landlist/landhome.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Essentially, U have only 1 choice for film type if U want new film.  That's the "packfilm" which is the peel apart Polaroid film.  It is still being made new by Fujifilm.  U can get color packfilm and 2 speeds of black and white film.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a Polaroid 360 packfilm camera, which U can get used on eBay for around $25.  If U study the link above, you'll see lots of other good choices too.<br>  <br>  Other kinds of Polaroids, like the SX-70 film, 600 film, or Spectra film polaroids can be found, but as U wrote, they aren't making film for them anymore.  In a year, U won't be able to get any film for them and the cameras will be junk.  Stick with packfilm.<br>  <br>  Maintenance:  make sure the lens is clear and free of fungus.  Make sure the shutter operates properly.  Look for any holes in the lens bellows.  Make sure the camera back closes and is light tight.<br>  <br>  Film:  Color film in ISO 80-100 is easily found.  And U can get B&W film in ISO 80 to 100, and ISO 3000.<br>  <br>  Hope U like this answer!!
8AYA5gTBaa	Without knowing model numbers or having photos of the cameras, it's difficult to know which is newer.     In terms of which is better, any camera that affords the photographer some control over the final photo is better, at least in my book!    To find out which is newer, you can always go to the Land list and see if you can find your cameras there.  http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/landhom...

However, "Belly" and "Juice" are ONLY available on Region 1 discs.  Neither film has ever been released on Region 2, which is why you can't find them.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	You are looking for region 2 and all you can find is region 2?I am confused.
HFuI8oVYaa	More good things:<br>  1. Auto ISO mode.<br>  <br>  2. Noise performance at ISO 200 equivalent to other higher megapixel dSLR cameras at ISO 100.<br>  <br>  3. You can set the function button to have easy access to ISO, WB, or self timer.<br>  <br>  4. Great battery life. You can get 2000+ images on a charge if you don't use flash.<br>  <br>  5. Small size for a dSLR.<br>  <br>  Other bad things:<br>  1. Exposure metering tends to blow out highlights, properly exposing for shadow areas. I usually keep my EV compensation set to -0.7.<br>  <br>  2. Doesn't automatically disable Auto ISO mode when you go into manual mode. Pain in the butt!<br>  <br>  3. Limited lens selection unless you don't mind manual adjustments. Only certain modern lenses will work with the D40 in full auto mode.<br>  <br>  4. No exposure bracketing. Not a problem unless you like to do HDRI.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	If your Nikon lenses don't have an internal motor (non AFs types) then they won't auto focus on a D40 or D60 for that matter. To use the older lenses with auto focus you have to buy a D80 or higher. <br>  <br>  The D40 and D60 have very limited functions (no auto bracketing is just one), there is no remote shutter release socket, and only has 3 focus points. They are cameras you can grow out of hence the low price.<br>  <br>  You can use your lenses with manual focus. Nikon lenses are good, but to upgrade them to auto focusing types would cost several times the cost of the camera.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|i5OVORXgaa	It's a good starting camera.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Yes,it is a good DSLR camera<br>  Pros: <br>  1.

No direct button to change QUAL, WB and ISO settings <br>  2. Grip comfortably but might be a bit too small for some people <br>  3. No top LCD and no front command dial <br>  4. Autofocus will not work with non AF-S or non AF-I lenses (such as the 70-300m G and 50mm f/1.8D lens) <br>  5. No AF/MF switch (have to use the switch on the lens) <br>  6. Only 3 autofocus point <br>  7. 6 Megapixel <br>  8. No night landscape mode in pre-programmed settings <br>  9. No in camera image stabilization but Nikon has lenses with it (VR). <br>  10.

The cons that person mentioned are not necessarily relevant when considering a camera of this class/price-range. I own this camera, and i would say the largest con is the performance in low-light. You can not really use ISO 800 or above. Sensitivity is better controlled on more professional cameras. This is a good starter camera and should get you started just fine. It is a very beginner friendly, and it extremely easy to use. As long as you are not doing low-light work, or have AF lenses, the D40 is great.
