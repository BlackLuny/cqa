20090204235619AArnEgI	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Are all HDMI cables compatible for the PS3?	When I plugged an HDMI cable into my PS3 it said that the cable was incompatible. Then it asked if I wanted to let it change the settings automatically. I said ok, then my picture changed into HD. Also, every time before a load screen, the screen flashes white with a quick static sound. Im using a 1.3 gold plated cable.      What does the message mean when it says the cable is incompatible, even if it works? What settings did it change?   How do I fix the static problem and the white screen?

I was watching the G4 channel on Direct TV and there was this program about the most upcoming anticipated games that are coming out this year.

It surprised me in being a Wii game.    Does anyone know the name of it? Or even heard of it? I just didn't catch the name at all =/

20090205014559AAC7iN4	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	How can I get BT to fix my phone wiring? PART TWO?	Hi again, and thanks for your response LeedsLad.  I emailed those details off to Be (my ISP) and quoted you directly - hope you don't mind :).      This was their response;   Thank you for your update.      While performing the troubleshooting we have detected that your speed is being reduced when you use the test socket, behind your front plate.      This is quite unusual, because what the test socket does, is to disable all of the internal wiring at the premises. There you should have the clearest signal from BT, and your speed should be actually increased.      If the speed has been reduced, this means that the attenuation has been increased. Such changing of the attenuation is probably caused by bad internal wiring, since you are making changes only at the premises.      If for some reason your socket is not connected correctly, you will definitely experiencing issues with the speed and the reliability of the connection.      Please note that we are using the BT phone line to provide you with service. If the BT phone line is not correctly connected at the premises, we cannot do anything about it. We cannot send request to BT/Openreach to check it, because they are not dealing with such cases. They are dealing only with the equipment at the exchange and the telephone line outside the premises.      As we have ran several tests with our equipment, we have checked its health and it is working fine.      The only component that has left to be checked is your telephone socket and internal wiring.      I have noticed that there were quite a lot disconnections on the line and I have switched your noise margin profile to the default one. You will now have more reliable connection.      I'm stumped as to who I should go to now, as 1) the line is still disconnecting and 2) I never had ANY disconnections when I was with a different ISP.  Any further advice??

Can anyone please help me! I can't play like this! And I'm afraid to get used to it, bacause a lot of other games don't use that control setting.

I got my iPod Touch (2G) for Christmas, and straight away, the wifi on it worked perfectly, i could use everything on it, it was fast and i loved it however, due to another issue with my iPod Apple told me to put it into recovery mode, and restore it. okay, great, so i did that, and still didnt fix my problem, and now after doing that, the wifi doesn't work.

20090204232225AA9tMjk	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Is there a program to amp up quieter songs to be louder?	I don't exactly know how to describe what I'm talking about, so bear with me...    Is there some sort of program or way on my own computer to make quieter songs louder?  For instance, I have an album that was just recorded softer, and I have to turn my speakers up to hear it better.  That I can do easily enough, but when I'm burning cd's with a mix of music, it's annoying to have to keep turning the volume up and down based on what song is playing.  This happens on my mp3 player as well.  Likewise, some songs downloaded off Limewire are quieter, and I'm unable in many cases to find a louder version.  If this makes any sense to anyone, I would love a response or at least point me in the right direction.  Thanks in advance!

I always buy Philips earphones because they arent too expensive and have good bass and sound but they always last less then 6 months with me :( I think its cuz of the cable and wires.  I cant buy headphones cuz I have to wear them under my helmet.  Any suggestions?

I hear you gotta make all sorts of changes to your output, and input, and video, and other stuff about up-scaling... 780i, 780p, change the reso.... damn, I'm not exactly technologically savvy. Can I not just plug an HDMI cable from the back of my xbox to the back of my hdtv and be done with it?

20090205023507AAaXGSL	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	My phat PSP was working fine and reading both ISO and CSO files but now it doesn't?	The main thing here is that instead of formatting the memory card through the PSP, I formatted the memory card by the right click option when the PSP was connected to my PSP. After having formatted I created a folder called "ISO" and put my games into it, but even then the PSP won't read any of them. FYI: My Phat PSP is home brew ready and has worked perfectly fine before. Its just after my stupid mistake of formatting it manually from the PC that this problem has risen. Please suggest as to what I should do now to get it back and running??? Thanks in advance.

20090205061437AASvslE	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	I need a suggestion for a good digital camera?	I started out with a high end Minolta camera, and while I love the clarity of the photos, the bulk and making sure the camera stays safe just isn't worth it to me.      I made the switch to an Olympus Stylus 500 compact (at the time) digital camera, and was really happy with the clarity - both indoor and outdoor pictures were extremely clear, even though it was only a 5.0 megapixel camera.       When that camera got smashed in a hiking incident last year, I got an Olympus Stylus 710. It's much more compact, which is nice, but the pictures taken with it are EXTREMELY grainy, no matter how I adjust the settings.       I do alot of photo manipulation, and grainy pictures are a no go in this department. I have actually resorted to tearing apart my old camera, fixing it, and duct taping it back together.      Please, if someone could suggest a good compact digital camera with clear pictures both indoor and outdoor, I would be extremely thankful!
