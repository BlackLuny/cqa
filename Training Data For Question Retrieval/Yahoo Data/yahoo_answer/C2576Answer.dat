r1D9P4Vyaa	EGR= exhaust gas recirculation. To help burn the unburned fuel in the exhaust for  better emissions out the tail pipe. (cleaner exhaust)|`|AA10331789	<a href="http://www.aa1car.com/library/egr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aa1car.com/library/egr.htm</a>|`|z6J6monLaa	Good job that thunderbird can read a book cos its never worked on a bloody vehicle.EGR is a pipe a valve and a solenoid.A pipe runs from exhaust manifold to a flap valve which is held shut by a spring.When you start the car the valve is shut and when you accelerate its still shut.When you go down the road and hold a constant speed or liftyour foot of the throttle a solenoid senses the vacuum level at the induction manifold or on most diesels it is controlled by ECU mapping and the flap valve is opened usually by vacuum but on some vehicles electricaly.The engine then sucks in exhaust gasses from the exhaust manifold.This gas will not burn again so it lowers combustion temperatures in the cylinders so reducing (allegedly) nitrous oxides.The problem is that you are sucking dirty crap through a valve and eventually the valve starts to stick open due to carbon build up on the valve stem.Once upon a time you just blanked of the valve with a bit of tin but manufacturers got wise to this so build it into dual chamber induction manifold so you cant do that now so if you have problems with the bloody things now eg poor acceleration block off the point where it picks up exhaust gas so it cant breath the crap in.Too many on here read a bloody book and know jack about the reality.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	The EGR valve helps your car more efficiently and completely burn fuel by recirculating a portion of your exhaust and running it through the combustion process again. This results in a cooler, more complete burn of the fuel which decreases you car's noxious emissions by prohibiting the formation of some harmful gases.|`|3HSNFDaJaa	Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reduction technique used in most gasoline and diesel engines.<br>  <br>  EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders. Intermixing the incoming air with recirculated exhaust gas dilutes the mix with inert gas, lowering the adiabatic flame temperature and (in diesel engines) reducing the amount of excess oxygen. The exhaust gas also increases the specific heat capacity of the mix, lowering the peak combustion temperature. Because NOx formation progresses much faster at high temperatures, EGR serves to limit the generation of NOx. NOx is primarily formed when a mix of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperatures.<br>  [edit] EGR in spark-ignited engines<br>  In a typical automotive spark-ignited (SI) engine, 5 to 15 percent of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as EGR. The maximum quantity is limited by the requirement of the mixture to sustain a contiguous flame front during the combustion event; excessive EGR in an SI engine can cause misfires and partial burns. Although EGR does measurably slow combustion, this can largely be compensated for by advancing spark timing. The impact of EGR on engine efficiency largely depends on the specific engine design, and sometimes leads to a compromise between efficiency and NOx emissions. A properly operating EGR can theoretically increase the efficiency of gasoline engines via several mechanisms:<br>  <br>  Reduced throttling losses. The addition of inert exhaust gas into the intake system means that for a given power output, the throttle plate must be opened further, resulting in increased inlet manifold pressure and reduced throttling losses. <br>  Reduced heat rejection. Lowered peak combustion temperatures not only reduces NOx formation, it also reduces the loss of thermal energy to combustion chamber surfaces, leaving more available for conversion to mechanical work during the expansion stroke. <br>  Reduced chemical dissociation. The lower peak temperatures result in more of the released energy remaining as sensible energy near TDC, rather than being bound up (early in the expansion stroke) in the dissociation of combustion products. This effect is minor compared to the first two. <br>  It also decreases the efficiency of gasoline engines via at least one more mechanism:<br>  <br>  Reduced specific heat ratio. A lean intake charge has a higher specific heat ratio than an EGR mixture. A reduction of specific heat ratio reduces the amount of energy that can be extracted by the piston. <br>  EGR is typically not employed at high loads because it would reduce peak power output. This is because it reduces the intake charge density. EGR is also omitted at idle (low-speed, zero load) because it would cause unstable combustion, resulting in rough idle.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] EGR in diesel engines<br>  In modern diesel engines, the EGR gas is cooled through a heat exchanger to allow the introduction of a greater mass of recirculated gas. Unlike SI engines, diesels are not limited by the need for a contiguous flamefront; furthermore, since diesels always operate with excess air, they benefit from EGR rates as high as 50% (at idle, where there is otherwise a very large amount of excess air) in controlling NOx emissions.<br>  <br>  Since diesel engines are unthrottled, EGR does not lower throttling losses in the way that it does for SI engines (see above). However, exhaust gas (largely carbon dioxide and water vapor) has a higher specific heat than air, and so it still serves to lower peak combustion temperatures; this aids the diesel engine's efficiency by reduced heat rejection and dissociation. There are trade offs however. Adding EGR to a diesel reduces the specific heat ratio of the combustion gases in the power stroke. This reduces the amount of power that can be extracted by the piston. EGR also tends to reduce the amount of fuel burned in the power stroke. This is evident by the increase in particulate emissions that corresponds to an increase in EGR. Particulate matter (mainly carbon) that is not burned in the power stroke is wasted energy. Stricter regulations on particulate matter(PM) call for further emission controls to be introduced to compensate for the PM emissions introduced by EGR. The most common is particulate filters in the exhaust system that result in reduced fuel efficiency[citation needed]. Since EGR increases the amount of PM that must be dealt with and reduces the exhaust gas temperatures and available oxygen these filters need to function properly to burn off soot, automakers have had to consider injecting fuel and air directly into the exhaust system to keep these filters from plugging up.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	EGR:::: exhaust, gas,  recirculator valve|`|DltA6nLYaa	your egr valve is a sensor its a well known problem on vauxhalls if u clean it with carb cleaner this will clear the crap inside it its used to control air flow

jF0l4ghraa	it's downshifting.<br>  when a car is going ~50 mph, it'll be in 4th gear (high gear).  but when you want to go faster, 4th gear doesn't have enough torque to accelerate your car at a decent rate (it would take a long time, or even can't accelerate up a steep hill), so it drops down to 3rd gear.  in 3rd gear, there is a lot more torque.  this means it has enough power to accelerate.<br>  the jump is just the shifting. you can hear it.<br>  <br>  (these numbers change depending on the car.  they're just arbitrary examples)<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You have an automatic transmission. this means that the car is still shifting, but *you* aren't the one doing it.  Just place it into drive, and the computer worries about the shifting.  you still have gears.<br>  if it's a recent problem only, you may have lost power somewhere.  give your car a tune up.  new air filter first.  your car may be suffocating.  that's usually responsible for a drop in power.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	What you are actually feeling is the automatic transmission shifting to a lower gear which provides more torque to get up the hill.|`|fxxxMbXqaa	wow my car does the EXACT same thing. it's kind of annoying.
FsT54qh1aa	I've had that race before. The GA GT and the GP GT are pretty evenly matched but the GP GT usually wins the race by half a car in the quarter. A cold air intake won't do anything for a GA GT because they have a factory Ram Air box which is better than a CAI. The GP GT will gain a few ponies from a good CAI though. I think the Eclipse GT is the non-turbo version and it probably would probably come in last against the two other cars.|`|WWqmHTYSaa	screw the eclipse man they top out at 110.

lBH8j3mTaa	If you are going in to civilian training, the airplane flight school will be much cheaper than the helicopter flight school. Is any job better? It depends what you like.<br>  <br>  Flying airplanes is mostly for transport, whether it be people or cargo. <br>  <br>  Helicopter flying can be transport as well, but it is mostly is going to be more sightseeing, medical evacuations, Law enforcement, news-chopper, oil rig work, pipeline and powerline work, etc. <br>  <br>  Also most heli jobs are going to be held by ex-military pilots, so if you are civilian trained, they will all have a better resume than you (for the most part) Not to say there are not civilian heli pilots out there, but I have found that the majority are ex-military. <br>  <br>  The airplane pilot field is much less saturated with ex-military pilots so it would be a more even playing field in terms of resume's and getting a job. <br>  <br>  If you are young enough and want to be an airplane/heli pilot nothing beats the training and experience of the military.

But I would say personally I would be getting my daughter/son a chevy tracker or dodge nitro.

Don't laugh and think I'm off my rocker the power plants in them are from KTM and the shocks on them are from Fox Shocks|`|4tuyvIDRaa	Check these babies out: www.giobikes.com<br>  <br>  YFZ is a bit too expensive, consider cheaper alternative which may not last forever but at least they will still be fun and easy on your pocket.|`|miyAb7cQaa	My top 3 are: <br>  1. Yamaha Raptor 660R (NOT the 700.)<br>  2. YFZ 450R.<br>  3. Banshee 350 Twin.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	Buy yamaha, I've got a banshee, raptor and grizzly and I haven't had one problem with any of them.|`|8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	The YFZ450 and Raptor 700 are good quads, but the KTM 505SX and 525XC will blow them away. If you can afford a KTM, they are well worth the money. I also like the Can-Am DS450.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, go to the sand dunes and look for a race between a KTM and any other stock quad. If the riders are equal, the KTM will win every time.
CWzx6w2yaa	i would to to pick the maybach 62 because the back seats recline. it has shades you can pull over the windows. the maybach 62 is more expensive at $390,000 and the bentley is $263,990|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Bently.<br>  <br>  The Maybach is a Mercedes S class with more leather and cusion and features.

r1D9P4Vyaa	They do make tape just for the exhaust for a temporary fix. Check with your local auto parts store for it. Duct tape on the exhaust is not good.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	It will start fire.<br>  <br>  I put electric tape, which could withstand 350 Degrees Farenheit.<br>  And it melted after 20 minutes of driving.<br>  <br>  It is not okay to do.<br>  <br>  Peole instead use wire hangars used for handling clothes to hold their exhaust up or mufflers on.|`|PEN3hha7aa	lol, sounds like you are doing what everyone else does when they don't have the money to fix their exhaust.  Watch out for those alleged "repair kits" cuz they are pretty much worthless too.<br>  The tape probably won't start a fire cuz the exhaust does not get That hot, but it will melt away and you will have to do it again much sooner than you think.|`|XFHleRhWaa	IT DEPENDS ON THE LOCATION OF THE TAPE! CLOSE TO THE MANIFOLD IT WILL FLAME AND BURN, OUT TOWARDS THE TAILPIPE, PROBABLE NO PROBLEMS.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	It probably won't start a fire but there is still the potential.  The tape will melt though as the exhaust becomes too hot for the tape.|`|JKQhSGEEaa	duck tape lol its duct tape. it will melt no matter where it is put. you can get heat tape from local auto store that will work way better than duct tape
8cbN9z4Uaa	Hi, The IAT sensor HAS to be on the intake..that includes the air filter and any ducting before it,and  before and after the airflow sensor leading to the intake manifold. It should be the only 2 wire sensor in that area. The CTS is likely on the thermostat housing, which can be found by following the upper radiator hose to the engine (unless it has reverse cooling). It should have 2 CTS's one for the gage or warning light and one for the injection system. PLEASE NOTE: The 'chip' that you bought does nothing but trick the engine computer into thinking it's always cold and increasing the pulse width of the injectors-spraying more gas(petrol). You'll be better off going cold air intake (K&N) and high flow cat AND back exhaust system. A bigger throttle body and/or hotter cams work well also Let that engine breathe and it'll make power. Happy Motoring..Geo

tFfUMQtyaa	To be honest Vintage UK motorcycles seem to be "Recession proof" the prices are still sky high.

If the customer was offended, then it was offensive, because he was offended.    It's really not any of my business whether he was offended or not.  I don't even know the guy.|`|AA11447210	If the customer was offended, that's what matters. The comment was inappropriate regardless of whether anyone here thinks it was offensive or not.    The guy at the dealership shouldn't be upset that a customer's car needed maintenance. That's how they keep making money after the sale.|`|JD5ymxKTaa	Its not offensive, but he shouldnt have said that to the customer.|`|bOjhqCQyaa	Yes. He should have been more professional.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	Unfortunately - i think it probably is/was offensive. I suspect that the GM had to admonish Dennis to keep his thoughts to himself. It would be the same to suggest that Irish, Italian, or Mexican people "never have money to keep them maintained". If Dennis thought he could "shame" this customer into authorizing the work it clearly backfired.|`|ksFD7EoSaa	He is stereo typing his race unfairly and I would be offended if I were that customer. These are the type of comments that make a customer want to take their vehicle some place else. Your service manager is bound to make an example of him so people will not get the wrong impression. Their may be some truth to what he said, but he has no right to voice his opinion. I would suspend him for a week to bring that point home.
bxlYleZkaa	Ask other people who drive the car you want to make the club about.
ewbuVeTTaa	I'd take the Honda given the choice between them but I would first get it checked out. 98K miles sounds suspicious for a car 10 years old or more, so I'd get the VIN and check it on Carfax for mileage check, accidents, flood damage, etc.  If you have a Visa/MC credit or debit card, this will cost $30. If the mileage checks out, take it to a mechanic, if the mechanic says nothing major is wrong, I'd take it. If something medium is wrong, then I'd weigh the cost of fixing it or saving more money to buy a better car. If of course something major is wrong, move on.  <br>  <br>  $2000 isn't the ideal amount to buy a car cash with, but if you are patient and really shop around, you might find a decent car for that on Craigslist, Ebay, Autotrader, the local paper classifieds. That's how I got my Accord. It was $1500 and it's only needed a transmission computer, $50 from a junkyard, new front brakes $230, and new tires $400 and has held up ever since.  <br>  <br>  If you can avoid going into debt for a car or anything else, I'd take it. Cars that you would need a loan for one, depreciate, two creates expenses. As stated, even with a car you need a loan for, you still have to pay tax on it, insurance, title, tags, car payment, etc. You pay the same for a car you buy outright minus a car payment and any repairs are a lot easier to make without a car payment on top of it. <br>  <br>  According to carsurvey.org here are some ideas for cars you can get for $2000 that are known to be reliable<br>  <br>  1990-1994 Honda Accord<br>  1990-1994 Honda Civic<br>  1990-1994 Toyota Corolla<br>  <br>  1990-1994 Buick Century<br>  1990-1994-Buick Park Avenue<br>  1990-1994 Pontiac Bonneville--all of these have a GM 3800 V6, a engine known for longevity.<br>  <br>  1985-1994 Subaru GL/DL/GL-10/Loyale<br>  Any Volvo 240/740/760/940/960--provided maintenance records are kept<br>  <br>  <br>  Craigslist, Ebay, the local paper classifieds, Autotrader and even the thrifty nickel or the equivalent where you live are all good sources to find cars.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Hhx21tU4aa	You are in a "frying pan vs. the fire" situation here.  The autos you list certainly have decent mileage for the prices listed.<br>  <br>  There are several things to consider:<br>  <br>  1.  Used cars can range anywhere from very good to clunkers, even if they cost more than $2000.  I know your money is tight, but getting a mechanic to check out the vehicle (it usually costs around $100) will give you some assurance that a major repair will probably not be necessary, at least for a while.  Of course, life happens, but it will give you a more confident feeling about the car, especially an older, less expensive one.  If someone doesn't allow an independent inspection, run, don't walk, away from the car.<br>  <br>  Remember to pull a CarFax, keeping in mind it is just one tool of several when evaluating a vehicle. Both an inspection and a CarFax will cost you upfront, but they can help you avoid purchasing a car that will start breaking down sooner then expected.<br>  <br>  Some used car dealers offer a warranty, but there are often many complaints of them finding a way to wiggle out of paying for a repair.  Check the dealer out with the Better Business Bureau.  They don't have to be a member to be a decent place of business, but if they have received a rating from the BBB, it will be yet another tool to help you.<br>  <br>  Look for consumer reviews of the make, model and year of the car you are considering.  One such source is www.carsurvey.org but there are others which are listed below.<br>  <br>  2.  A loan is a problem given that you don't have a full-time job.  Can your mom co-sign for you?  That may be the best way to get a more recent vehicle,   Actually, generally speaking car loans are among the easiest types of loans to get, as you might have surmised from various ads.  Buy here, pay here is offered, as well as standard loans.<br>  <br>  Another plus would be it might establish your credit rating with one or all of the three major bureaus, although not immediately because of your age.  I don't know if the minimum age for these reporting agencies is 18 or 21, but it's worth considering.<br>  <br>  Lastly, remember that used cars will never be perfect, and that the outside is of much less importance then the mechanical components.  Some "beaters" (term for ugly looking cars that can go well past 200,000 miles) can be great bargains.<br>  <br>  Mostly, you want a car that won't constantly leave you stranded (been there, done that!).  Your safety is of the utmost concern.  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. On the MSN and Edmunds sites, you will find a link to consumer reviews below the numerical rating for the car (7.5, 8.0 etc.)|`|KdFXk0ajaa	You don't mention how much of a car payment you would be able to afford if you can secure a loan. A new car with a warranty would be great for a young lady traveling back and forth to school. I have owned 3 Hyundai Sonata's (2001, 2003, 2008) and have had no problems with any of them. They also come with "roadside assistance" if you break down, run out of gas, or any other problem like AAA does. The other up side to Hyundai if you are buying is their resale value is not great. You might be able to find a 2004-2006 Accent or Elantra with 20,000 miles of warranty left (for your protection against mechanical problems), and affordable payments. Just make sure you know when the car was sold originally so you know how many months of warranty protection you have as even though Hyundai/Kia advertise 10 years/100,000 mile powertrain warranty (engine) that is normally only for the first owner then it reverts to 5 yr/60k miles unless they can show you the paperwork that the original owner paid additional to make the powertrain warranty transferrable.<br>  Going older used (especially Honda, Toyota, Nissan) there are a few high priced items to watch for so it should be checked by a mechanic. You need to be sure if it has a "timing belt" (instead of a chain) it has been replaced if the car has over 60,000 miles on it. If the timing belt goes and you keep driving it will lead to a major repair bill.<br>  You sound like an intelligent, level headed young lady who knows to get basic, solid transportation, and not incur large amounts of debt.<br>  I have provided you with a link below to the Magliozzi Bros. website they have a PBS TV Show and a syndicated newspaper column about all things automobile. If you don't know a good mechanic they have referrals by zip code to honest, local mechanics. Try Yahoo Autos, MSN, and your local paper for cars. kbb.com  edmunds.com will tell you what a car is worth to give you an idea if the price being asked is reasonable. Quick question you are figuring the cost of car insurance? On a $2,000 car you don't carry collision or comprehensive usually so you just need liability and PIP (personal injury) to get rolling.<br>  Best of luck to you and should you ever become a person of even greater importance than you are now please remember SgtV. tried to help you|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	There will be neverending costly repairs and annoyance...and safety concerns??

Anything that cheap on a lot, probably needs up to six grand to fix it once their quick fixes stop working. One used I bought broke the next day, after I got to work an hour away so I was hours late and in the end I gave the car back and took ahit on my creidt. I then bought a more expensive used car, it lasted6 months and needed 3500 just to make it drivable , and that lasted 3 years and I had to do the same repair again.<br>  Take into account that you have to hve insurance too. If you do not work and have an income, there will be noone to give you a loan hun.  Id get up early and take the bus, or find someone who wants to ride share and save that two grand. It will be the same as throwing it away, you wll hve to register it, get an inspection possibly title it and insurance, so you need more than that. A private person, may, I say may have a half way decent car to sell, but even they do not know when their older car will break, even if they are super honest. Sad but true, its just a bad situation. Find a way to school, you may take a taxi a few times and start posting all over to ride share.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	This is a very easy question.<br>  <br>  It's never a good idea to take out loans and pay EXTRA.  You simply don't need to.  If you have $2000 cash, I would advise you to find a really solid older car that belongs to a little old lady that you can buy for $1000.  Use the other $1000 for insurance, mainteance, and upkeep.  YOU'LL NEED IT!  CARS COST MONEY TO OPERATE!<br>  <br>  When money is tight, you should never never never never borrow money so you can pay EXTRA.  That's crazy.  That's like a sick man poisoning himself.  It doesn't even make sense.

I don't know which business you are referring to but I do know that most pizza places run your mvr twice a year at random. Most allow 2 tickets in 3 years. If you get 3 tickets then you can't drive until one clears off. Some places are more or less strict than others. Most likely though if you left, they would run your mvr again since they would essentially be rehiring you if you came back.|`|mlLnk1Vaaa	you have violated the requirements of the job so therefore you will not get called back...too much liability on the company if you were to run another stop sign or get another sort of ticket...|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Sounds like their rules are pretty strict and that companies have to have good drivers because it would look bad if for example a Wallmart van drives in to a house or causes an accident.

IT's a big giant mess for EVERYONE.    After the Big 3 were bailed out by the government, they reduced their FICO requirement from 700 to 620. So more people should be able to afford their cars.

R8DXKrF1aa	I'm assume you're talking about the R35 GT-R?    If so, it is because the GT-R is a limited production car.  Only about 1500 come into the United States each year and many have already been pre-ordered so they go straight to the new owners.  The ones that don't go to a few specially certified Nissan dealers - Nissan mostly focused on the dealers that sold the most Z's.  Those dealerships also had to get special GT-R technicians and other specialty people for the GT-R.    There was, in fact, a GT-R at a dealership a few miles from my house some time ago, but I'm not sure if they still have it.        If you were talking about the Nissan Skyline Coupe/Sedan, see Neil ^above^.

gstBWswfaa	to keep the subwoofer from playing frequecies lower than itsrated to do, which causes damage|`|ItLkRdzCaa	It's the control knob which adjusts the level at which you'd like the sub-sonic filter to be.    A Sub-Sonic filter filters out frequencies:    1.) below what is able to be heard by a human being. (Which is between 20 and 20,000 Hz)  and/or  2.) below what is able to be reproduced by your sub-woofers.     Sub = Below  Sonic = Audible Sound    If you have say a sub-woofer that has a frequency range of 20-200 Hz, then you would want to set the amplifier to filter out frequencies below 20 Hz. (19 and below...)

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	No, there is no recall on Dex-Cool. GM had a faulty gasket design on its 60-degree V6 engines and there was a class-action lawsuit which placed the blame on the coolant, not the gasket, which I'm sure GM was very satisfied with.      But I can assure you, that's not a coolant problem.    If your still running on the original Dex-cool your car came with then there is no wonder its no good.  It should have been flushed and refilled at least twice by now.  Dex has a theoretical service life of 5 years/150,000 miles but usually has to be changed more frequently than that.|`|i5lk5eN2aa	There is no recall on Dex-Cool antifreeze. The problems it causes is a result of the way it is marketed. It is marketed as an extended life antifreeze with 5 years/150,000 protection but the problem is that it's anti-corrosive additives break down and it becomes as corrosive as any other ethylene glycol base or propylene glycol base antifreeze. Antifreeze should be changed every 2 to 3 years or every 24,000 to 30,000 miles to prevent gasket failure caused by contaminated antifreeze which has become too corrosive and the only safe way to use the extended life Dex-Cool antifreeze beyond 2 to 3 years is to test it's alkalinity by measuring the coolant pH level with pH test strips, something like Acustrip antifreeze test strips, to determine if the antifreeze coolant is corrosive and whether or not it's anti-corrosive additives has life left.|`|VItj8zdAaa	sorry, there is no recall on dexcool.  in fact, every new gm vehicle produced up to this date has dexcool in the system.  there used to be a problem with gaskets corroding and leaking on the intake manifolds, they fixed that problem with revised gaskets.  however, it wasn't a safety concern and decided it wasn't eligable to become a recall.
SttRtZ1Kaa	First thing to check is all moving parts on the brakes are free.<br>  (The brake Caliber is sliding ok, The Caliber sleeve is moving ok).<br>  Next are the "discs" in good smooth condition,<br>  If badly uneven, The pads will have to wear to that shape.<br>  (Ideally, new disc's required).|`|hkLY035raa	Did you get the semi-metallic brake pads?  I've had some experience with those.  They work great, but they make an awful teeth-grinding sound even when they're okay.<br>  <br>  As for the smell, go for a longish (10 miles or so) drive where you don't have to touch the brakes, and coast to a stop somewhere safe.  Hop out and feel the wheel hubs immediately.  Hot?  Really hot?  Brakes aren't releasing, and that's a job for a brake shop.<br>  <br>  Get that fixed pronto, dragging the brakes can wreak all kinds of havoc on brake discs, wheel bearings, and most of all on fuel mileage.  You'll pay through the nose for every inch of dragging brakes until it's fixed.|`|FncktQ4gaa	When you changed the pads you needed to make sure the rotors were not warn and possible need to be turned.

BPgqX8tYaa	If you live in Fairbanks, Alaska or Helsinki, Finland, the start-up procedure will be a lot different than if you live in Rio or Phoenix.    Most modern cars require no special start-up procedure or warm-up in moderate weeather. Letting it warm-up just wastes gas. Go easy on the throttle for the first few blocks, then drive normally.    Daily care is minimal. Walk around your car the first time you drive each day to see if there's anything obvious amiss, like a low tire. Buy a good tire gauge, learn how to use it, and check pressure once a week. The correct pressure is in your owner's manual, and also shown on a plaque on the driver's side door frame or in the glove box.     DO NOT inflate your tires to the maximum shown on the sidewall. That will cause reduced traction, erratic handling, and uneven wear.    Use the grade of gasoline recommended by the manufacturer. Putting high octane gas in a car not designed for it is a waste of money, because the engine's low compression ratio can't take advantage of premium's higher resistance to preignition ("knock"). Conversely, using a lower octane gas in a car designed for premium will cause your engine's computer to retard the spark and richen the fuel mixture, reducing power, and increasing fuel consumption.    Learn where your dipstick is, how to use it, and check your oil once a month.    Follow your manufacturer's recommendation as to oil grade and change interval. They will have a more frequent interval for extreme use, which for most of us means if we typically drive a couple of miles and let the engine cool off before driving again. I advise using a full synthetic oil like Mobil 1 or Castrol Syntec. They protect your engine on those cold starts (the hardest condition your engine encounters) best.    Use a local independent tire store and get to know them. Have them inspect your tires every 5,000 to 10,000 miles to see if they need to be rotated. This is especially important with front-wheel drive vehicles, as the front tires do all the work of accelerating, braking, and turning.    Keep your car clean, inside and out, including the undercarriage, where mud can accumulate. Use a hose with a spray nozzle and wash out the wheel wells when you wash the car. Any good wax will protect the finish and keep the car looking like something you want to take care of.    That's important, because you want to keep it a long time. The longer you keep it, the less it costs, and keeping a car fifteen years saves about a year's worth of gasoline compared to changing cars every five years (based on the energy cost of building a new car). If everyone did that it would cut fuel consumption overall by 6.7%.    And enjoy your car. Good motoring to you!|`|GHefTsUyaa	Just start the car first.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	You're listening to confused idiots.    Just crank the car and let it sit for 30 seconds or so before you start to drive. That's all you need to do. It doesn't matter if the heat, radio, lights, etc are on before or after. It makes no difference.    Get the oil changed every 5000 miles and have the air filter checked at that time.    Keep proper air in the tires. Full service gas station can do that for you, or tire shop.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	drive it, get it serviced, get it MOT'd, clean it and dont crash.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Remowlms is right - can't understand how he has a thumbs down.  Your heater doesn't work until the engine is hot. You can try it if you like!  The general idea to give the starter motor the best chance & not to excessively drain the battery is not to have blower, lights, radio, wipers, etc on until the car has started.  My best tip for driving any car is READ THE HANDBOOK - and if you don't have one, buy one. There are plenty on Ebay.|`|fOZPJhoPaa	personally I would start the engine without anything else (such as heaters, stereo etc.) on first, Hving lights and stuff on drains you battery, but as you drive it recharges your battery ok.You can get some good info from the web check out  www.merlinhelpsstudents.com/lifestyle/...|`|ZEwAalKPaa	I think that the people you have been talking to know diddly squat about cars as well.  Get in the car, start it, then turn your heater and radio on.  Before you start it the heater motor and the radio are drawing current from the battery and on mornings like this morning it is best to have your full battery charge available for the starter motor which has a heavy current drain. As soon as you start the engine the alternator is producing current and charging the battery so what you take out with heater and radio is being constantly replaced.    But, to be honest, it generally will not make much difference either way.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	The first person is nuts as you can't use the heater in the car to heat the car until the engine has been running.  It uses the coolant, which is heated from the running engine, to heat the vehicle.    Change the oil as instructed in the vehicle manual...|`|9gsm05lnaa	Start the car first before turning heaters and all of that nonsense on. If you run the heaters without the car running, it will drain your battery faster. I have been driving for a while so I know this stuff. If you don't believe me, try it, and let me know how long it took for AAA to get there to jump start your car for you!!!!|`|RLPM48F8aa	On some cars in cold countries like Sweden you can get an electric immersion heater that goes in the top radiator hose. With this you can warm the engine in the garage before you start up, Otherwise just start up & drive off.|`|sP98NDi5aa	Start the car let it run for 30 seconds to a minute. This applies to anytime of year. Keep your tires inflated to pressure on the sticker in the driver doorjamb, change oil according to manufacturers specs. probably 3,000 miles. Change air filter every third oil change, rotate tires every other oil change, change fuel filter every 20,000 miles or so. Your maintenance manual will say when.|`|mv3MzzBJaa	You need to start the car making sure everything else is switch OFF. If the heater is on it will be more effort for the car to start.    Besides - the heater will be cold as it gets heat from the engine. It won't be hot unless the engine has been running for a while.    You are not supposed to sit and warm the car up with the car stationary either. You get in turn the key and drive. As you drive this constantly keeps the battery charged.    Basic maintenance includes:    Checking tyre pressures  Check oil level  Check water level  Check break fluid  Check your windscreen wipers aren't split  Check your tyre tread    Change the spark plug perhaps every 12 months or 12000-15000 miles - and maybe your air filter too.|`|dYRWG3WTaa	The first suggestion doesnt even make sense, if you were to get in the car and just turn the key on to run the heaters without starting the engine, you are using the battery so I dont know how that would stop the battery from dying! The engine is what charges the battery (and what generates heat, so turning the fan on isnt going to generate enough heat to heat anything up, especially if you live up north where its freezing) so you shouldnt just turn the key on and let the battery run before you start the engine.  Once the car is started you can turn your radio and heaters on. When I started driving i was told it was always a good idea to shut the radio off before i shut the car off just to save the battery from running on it's own. Start the car first, it's the engine that charges the battery, and when you do need to leave just the key on without the car running, it's always a good idea to start the engine every once in a while too so you can juice up the battery. If you battery is old, don't keep the key on w/out the engine running for too long, that will cause the battery to die even quicker than if you had a newer battery.  Just maintain the oil changes when you should, have filters, fluids checked, and when you think there is a problem have it checked before it gets worse and your car should last you for a while! Good luck and drive safely!|`|hbanGS3Qaa	ok champ   no one here knows about living in snow country  so they think who ever said what they said to you is a moron or an idiot  this is how it works and pay close attention  if u are up in smow country    u need to keep your motor worm over night   and what alot of people do is they cover there motor with one of those heated blankets so that the battery doesnt freez over night its the cheapest way to go.    what happens when its supper cold is that the oil becomes thick and its hard to pump oil to the rest of the motor and the ani freez after a certain point will freez and then you got serious problems      and that it y u need to keep the motor area worm over night so u can start your car in the morning  go to any mart and buy a heated blanket and an extention cord that is gonna reach your car from the house unless you have power in the Garage  it does depend on where you live|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	What does your owner's manual say?  I would advise you to follow your owner's manual advice about "drying out" your battery.    Translation: you're listening to a bunch of idiots.  Anytime you're confused by idiots, use the owner's manual.  Don't argue with the idiots.|`|XtUwTozvaa	start the car before turning anything on especially the lights,starting the car uses the most energy|`|WLg3VzBkaa	Just get in your car and turn it on. You can't "warm up" your car with the heater since the car will not heat up unless water is flowing through the heater core (i.e. your car is running and water is being circulated through the engine...it eventually heats up). It is probably not wise turn on every accessory in the car prior to starting it since it will use amps from the battery but having things like the radio or A/C on prior to starting shouldn't cause problems with properly maintained battery. If you just follow your maintenance schedule in the owners manual that should be sufficient. Also remember, your car is a machine, if you notice something isn't right(odd sound, feel,etc) ...it probably isn't.|`|PhCbCjWkaa	i would love to know what heaters u r going to switch on first!!!!. the only heaters in a petrol car i know of take their heat from the water system which it get by cooling the running engine.

And if you swing it around hard enough, you can even get the liquid completely off the bottom of the cup.  Now put a cap on top of the cup and swing it around again.  Everything stays in, right?<br>  <br>  Same deal with the baffle.  It keeps most of the oil down inside the sump so the oil pickup always is covered by oil and the oil pump is always pumping oil through the engine.  When cars weren't as powerful and roads were worse, vehicles never really got fast enough or turned violently enough to uncover the oil pickup, but times have changed.  The baffle also keeps oil from sloshing up and hitting the crankshaft (though it can still happen, especially in an overfilled condition), which could cause oil frothing.  That would be almost as bad, since the oil pump is no good at pumping foam.|`|1d4b568abb0ede4a3c45f22f18da199eaa	it keeps the oil from shifting around to fast in the pan. gas tanks in cars and in delivery tankers use this system. it helps keep the oil away from the crank where it would be whipped up and be sort of like whipped cream.in gas tanks it keeps gas in a bowl to not starve the motor . in tankers its to keep the liquid from all shifting to one side and cause a tip over|`|8823042827de50d202b1ecf3cbf9af80aa	The above answer about returning oil to the sump & keeping the pick up coverd is correct .

1NumX5aqaa	I assume it's a dx or lx?<br>  <br>  If you want to keep the stock engine then the first thing I would do is convert it over to manual transmission with shorter gear ratios (civic ex tranny). Next I would swap the stock head and ecu out for the vtec head. Once you have the tranny, vtec and ecu in you should concentrate on typical bolt-on mods like intake, header, high flow cat and exhaust. You should be able to accomplish this for around 3k if you do the work yourself (other than exhaust... unless you weld) and do some shopping around for good deals. You will notice a substantial difference from these, about 25 hp over what you have now and shorter gears.<br>  <br>  Now if you want to get even better performance (for about the same price) then upgrade to a B series. You could install (yourself) a B16 engine, tranny, ecu, axles, etc for about 2k then use the rest of your money to finish off the I/H/C/E. This would be a major difference, about 40 hp more than the first list of mods and even shorter gearing, 65 hp over what you've got now. This will actually not be any more difficult than the previously mentioned, actually in my opinion it's much easier.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of mods you can do but it is best to start with a good platform to do other mods to and a longer geared automatic is not a very good start for performance.|`|HUluAQM3aa	Perform better how?<br>  Speed?<br>  Looks?<br>  Acceleration?<br>  Handling and ride comfort?<br>  Economy?<br>  <br>  The list can go on for a long time and do you have a budget?

r1D9P4Vyaa	Just your basic tune up is only spark plugs, air & fuel filter. But your year car may have 100.000 mile platinum plugs in it, if it does do not change them until you have a problem with them, I have seen those run/work good for a lot longer. If they do need replacement stick with the GM plugs. I would look in your owners manual to see the replacement miles for your plugs. If they are the good plugs then all you will need is a air & fuel filter, about $75 installed.  If it is running good now and just a maintenance tune up no plugs wires are needed, do not let someone say that you need them.|`|HUluAQM3aa	You fail to mention the mileage of the vehicle.<br>  A vehicle like yours requires maintenance based on mileage most of the time and "tune-up" is less of a tune and more of a replacement of items and fluids that wear out or age due to usage.<br>  I'll list what is typical.<br>  <br>  Oil and filter change.<br>  Fresh spark plugs.<br>  Fresh air filter.<br>  Check level and condition of engine coolant.<br>  Check level of power steering fluid.<br>  Check condition and tension of drive belts.<br>  Check level of transmission fluid.<br>  Clean battery terminal posts and snug up if required.<br>  Rotate tires and check tire pressure.<br>  Inspect brake system, pads and rear shoes.<br>  <br>  If you have lots of mileage.<br>  Change coolant.<br>  Possibly change the ignition wires.<br>  Possibly change transmission fluid.<br>  Replace drive belts.<br>  Inspect upper and lower ball joints.|`|c48nm70gaa	There are only a couple of things that your Pontiac should need for an average tune-up. AC Delco ignition wires and a set of AC Delco iridium tipped spark plugs. Any private mechanic can pull off this service for you but it's *very important to use the above ignition parts. <br>  <br>  Stand your ground. Do not let anyone talk you into other aftermarket no name parts.<br>  <br>  You can always do a great job of cleaning your fuel system with 3M Total fuel system cleaner. NAPA or Carquest has this product. Dump a 16 oz. bottle of this cleaner in an empty fuel tank. Fill the gas tank with 14 gallons of 93 octane Sunoco fuel and plan an extended long high speed trip to allow the cleaner to do the best job.

But are you in an area where you can do that without angering the Emissions Gods?<br>  <br>  Fuel pump, manifold, the carb itself, plus the necessary kickup for speeding up the engine for AC use and idling in D.

8ifKojOXaa	Well you say that the temperature gauge is red lining but you don't clarify if the coolant system is actually phsically over heated but to me bec you mention disconnecting the temperature sensor, etc that tells me that either it keeps over heating asap or you've a bad temperature gauge or a bad connection going to the gauge or sensor. <br>   Keep in mind that the A/C has it's own sensor too.<br>   Basically the temperature sensor circuit would work like this.......once the sensor engages it changes the resistance with the circuit to the PCM, the fan relay circuit then should be engaged by the PCM internally via pins and wires, the fan relay then should close the circuit internally by connecting the feed it's getting at one pin from the fan fuse to the wire going to the fan via another pin.<br>   Once the fan is getting power the fan should be engaging and if not many times it's bad or corroded or rusted connections or faulty or damaged or frayed or burnt wiring going to the fan or it's simply a fan that isn't working.<br>   Regardless if the fan is engaging though the thermostat should be working and by squeezing the thermostat hose as the engine is cold started , pressure should start building within a few mins.If not the thermostat is faulty more then likely , thats one of the basic easy thermost tests you can perform or take it out and put in it in some boiling water , see if it opens , if it opens , soak it in cold water see if it closes, if not then it's faulty.  <br>   Remember that there is more then one fan relay and that the A/C's cooling system also basically works this way too. <br>   The temperature gauge should be getting a reading via the PCM and it's constant connection with the temperature sensor once the vehicle is started. <br>    If you're running into the temperature gauge suddenly going right up quite fast once key is even turned then it could be just a faulty wire going to the gauge or the gauge itself is faulty.You can get other gauges or dash clusters from a big do it yourself auto wreckers for quite cheap and if I was having issues with a gauge like that just going up by itself with just the key in then I'd be taking the dash cluster out and checking the wiring go to it or simply replacing it especially if acts up with a temperature sensor out of the vehicle.<br>   If the engine is started up and warmed up while the A/C or heat is on either a bad thermostat or one of the fan's isn't engaging, or the engine or rad has a air clog=air bubble" try using the bleeder valve or reading a service manual about bleeding coolant systems", or the water pump might be faulty, or the coolant is worn out so check it with a proper anti-freeze tester, the engine could have a bad gasket so check for ant oil in the coolant system, or the head might be cracked or it could be a leak or faulty hose etc.<br>   To me your problem sounds like one of the fans isn't engaging so try running the vehicle from a cold start and keep the blower motor off , alllow the vehicle to warm up , then make sure the thermostat is working properly , try the heat on full, then try the A/C on full, and if you don't see the fans ending up engaging while the vehicle is already at a good idling termperature with it idling a bit and with the heat etc on then you know where to start with this problem.<br>   Basically the fan or fans engage once the vehicle is idling while parked or when at a stop or when driving stop and go and really the fans aren't needed really much at hwy speeds bec that's mostly the thermostat and water pump that control the engine's operating temperature at hwy speeds .<br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.|`|Ea3x6dI1aa	Hi mate, check the thermostat. Sometimes they jamb shut when there is a bit of corrosion in the cooling system and don't open when the hot water arrives to let it pass through the system.

Even though it is only your rear windows that are messed up it is most likely your front driver side unit that needs replacing|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Sounds like you are going to have to invest in a Haynes or Clymer manual and strip a door down to see what's going on. It may be corrosion due to water ingress or something a can of WD40 will sort out but you won't know till you look. My guess would be it's mechanical and not electrical.|`|HUluAQM3aa	I would start by lubing the window guide channels with silicone spray.<br>  Moisten a corner of a paper towel with a good amount and run it inside the rubber gasket that the door glass guides itself in.<br>  <br>  Do at least 2 passes and do all four doors.  You should notice a huge difference on the speed in which the glass lowers and raises.<br>  <br>  Over time the channel binds with the glass as it moves.

hkLY035raa	It wasn't the timing belt.  If the timing belt was bad, the engine wouldn't start at all.  But replacing it wasn't a bad thing to do.  In fact, replacing all the stuff you've mentioned is good - you've eliminated a bunch of things already and now when you've got this last problem sorted, it should run great for a good long time.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing it's an automatic.  So, put it into gear: engine slows down and dies?  Your idle-up actuator isn't working.  It turns up the engine a little bit to keep it running at the right speed even against the light load of the torque converter at low speeds - the torque converter allows slippage so the engine can continue to run.  Lots of slippage at low speeds, so you can sit at lights without shifting out of gear, and next to no slippage at high speeds, so it works well when cruising along with traffic.<br>  <br>  Idle-up control.  What Ford calls it may vary, but that ought to be it.  There's a similar dealie to add power when you turn on the AC.<br>  <br>  [edit] hmm, idle control is new.  Dang, that shoots my theory down.  How's the catalytic converter?  My van would run at idle, but as soon as you added gas it turned into a wheezing arthritic pig because it was strangled at the exhaust side.  And it never threw a code on that, either.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Check your fuel filter.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	I would check the fuel pressure first, you filter coul be semi clogged and now not enough fuel is getting to the motor when you try to dirve it. if you are getting anti freeze in your oil you could have a bad head or head gasket but you would have white smoke coming out of your tail pipe.|`|NnYGsUAGaa	check for white smoke and do a block test to verify head gasket issue. doesn't sound likely though. could be transmission related (shift solenoid?)

You have a few problems from a legal stand point as I see it. If he gets in an accident with the car and causes someone physical harm  and has no insurance then the legal woes fall on you. Can you find out if he still has insurance on the car? You have a legally binding document obligating him to pay you back. Therefore you will get a judgement to get your money back without the car title. You do not want title in your name as that means as far as Florida is concerned it is your car. Now it is time to protect yourself from his possible stupidity. Can you contact me through Yahoo Answers as I could be typing all day and I want to help you now.

YupMCYHlaa	All the Japanese manufacturers are pretty good, they make a reliable, economical, long-lasting bike.  I am a Honda man myself and I think they have an edge, but they're all pretty good.<br>  <br>  If it's your first bike, I would recommend against going out and buying a shiny new bike to learn to ride. You're going to be hard on your first bike.  You're going to abuse the clutch, and you're very likely to drop it once or twice before you get the hang of it.  If you get a bike say 5-10 years old, perhaps even with already a few scrapes and bruises, you can sell it after six months or a year for about what you paid for it, and by then you will have a better idea what you want.<br>  <br>  ALL 750cc motorcycles are fast!  Any motorcycle that size can out-accelerate even the fastest cars.

For a first bike i wouldn't recommend a 750. No more than 600. They are still fast bikes and can easily keep up to a 750 unless you are flat out racing. 600s can achieve 0-60 in 4 seconds which is still much faster than some sports cars.|`|N6aHFzk6aa	Get a Harley I would recommend at least a 1200CC but if you want smaller go with the 883CC It will be the best buy for the buck.

Second is a battery draining overnight.   You can try this, if accessible, connect a jumper cable from the positive battery terminal and to the starter positive terminal. If you don't know what these are don't try it!! There is a lot of electrical currrent involved. This is a redundant power wire to see if there is a bad connection between the battery and starter.  If this doesn't help, run a jumper cable from the negative battery terminal to the engine (block or head).  This is also a redundant ground to see if power is lost between the battery and starter ground which is most likely the engine.  As per my second guess, disconnect the battery overnight (after is has been charged) and connect it in the A.M. and see if it starts, if so, you have a component draining your batteries power overnight.|`|a485249c3bac339c7f0182433bb64119aa	I doubt its the ignition switch though that is possible - I'm sure it's not the voltage regulator.  I suspect there's a clue in that it worked for a day after you replaced the battery, and again when you replaced the alternator.  The first thing to check would be connections to the battery, and to the starter motor and ESPECIALLY the connection to earth or ground - where the battery negative is connected to the vehicle body.  Also check the condition of any earthing strap between the engine and the body or chassis. These should all be spotlessly clean, rust free and tight.  If you can't find an earth strap between engine and body, experiment with a jumper cable between them - engines are rubber mounted so are fairly well insulated from the body so this strap is essential.  If this fails, check the switch. It sounds like its working because you hear the click of the solenoid, but I've been had like that before - it could be 'making and breaking' rather than just making!  Use a light bulb connected to the starter terminal of the ignition switch, and check that it is on when in start position.  Still no joy, then its either the starter motor or the solenoid, which is mounted on the motor.  Good luck!|`|R1E7Bn0raa	Check the battery when connected with a meter to see there is a drain on the battery when the truck is off. This is most likely the problem if you already replaced the battery and altenator.
bOjhqCQyaa	Make sure your oil level is where it should be?  Then, check your oil pressure. This may require special tools.  If you don't have the means of doing this, you may want to try thicker oil like 10w-30 instead of 5w-30 or SAE30 or 10w-40. Using thicker oil may compromise your fuel efficiency as well as engine operation.  If your engine is making noise it may be oil pressure.  If not, it may be a bad oil pressure sensor.

If you are, you're not required to go to driving school. Actually it's rather pointless. Most people are taught by their parents. You don't need to sign up for a "parent teaching driving" thing.

And of course, when you only have your permit, your parent HAS to be with you at all times in the car.

The flow control valve in the pump is also prone to sticking when contaminated. This causes low pressure. Is the fluid burnt? It may may mean that the forward clutch is bad. How is reverse engagement? In any case, diagnosis is needed to identify the cause. That means taking it in and having a pressure guage connected to see what the pressure is at the time the problem occurs.|`|78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	At 129,000 miles just how many times have you had the transmission fluid and filter changed?

Have the trans serviced with new filter and fluid, your shifting problem will probably improve, fluid breaks down over time and Escort is past due for a change.

Either is extremely common and is less of a downgrade than an S rated tire.

RQzsmvfiaa	There are some good answers here but not all exactly accurate. First off, VTEC with DOHC is better than a VTEC with SOHC because the DOHC setup is designed to breathe better- which increases hp more. This can be also said for a non VTEC DOHC vs. a non VTEC SOHC. While the Honda Civic VX/HX use a milder VTEC setup (called the VTEC-E) in their single cam engines for better economy, the Civic EX uses a more aggressive set up on it's single cam engine for more power. The DOHC does cost more and offers much more power but in terms of which is better is based on what you're looking for. If performance is key, then you can't beat any DOHC engine. However, note that DOHC tends to lack torque in lower RPMs compared to a SOHC setup so they don't respond as quickly so for a daily driver, SOHC may actually be better. Also, VTEC technology wasn't first introduced in a passenger car by Honda. Nissan introduced it back in 1986 on the 1987 Nissan Pulsar SE twin cam. It had a DOHC head and electronic variable valve timing and was called the CA16/18DE. Honda marketed the concept heavily and used the term "VTEC." Most people will tell you that the 1991 Acura NSX was the first to have it, but even the 1990 Nissan 300ZX twin turbo was already using electronic controlled valve timing.|`|903979cd92ae96bcf3363bec4693c23faa	Here is what you need to know, plain and simple<br>  <br>  1. DOHC daul over head cam and SOHC single over head cam, they are just an engine configuration. Vtec works the same way in both engines. Only on a SOHC you have the intake and exhaust lobes on one and the same cam. On a DOHC you have two cams, one for the intake valves and one for the exhaust. <br>  <br>  2. DOHC is better in terms of performance, most DOHC engines have better flow rates than SOHC engines of the same size. <br>  <br>  3. DOHC is usually more expensive|`|5Yu7wCeiaa	Every car these days has Vtec technology every different car company just calls it something else. it stands for Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control every car these days usually has some sort of this tech. DOHC will give you more power and usually wanted more like any other car. It is going to be a little more expensive but its worth it.|`|hDbavDYEaa	V Tec although only a single cam shaft is in effect a twin cam or DOHC if you prefer The second set of cam profiles engage at 4600RPM. This due to a clever valve system operated by oil pressure.

Typically DOHC VTEC Honda engines are geared towards performance where the SOHC VTEC counterparts are geared towards fuel economy.

WHENEVER someone fails to yield right of way they ALWAYS ALWAYS say the other person was speeding.  ALWAYS.      It doesnt matter if someone is speeding or not... first off.. you cant prove it (did you have a radar gun? did the witness?) Second you cant just fail to yield just b/c they were speeding.    Since you and the car owner did not have insurance you will now be responsible for all damages out of pocket. Their carrier will likely take care of teh damages and send you the bill.    If you dont pay the bill they will put a judgement against you.. have your licensed revoked and garnish wages.  Expensive lesson.
PvlpJ1IFaa	get speaker wire. you will have 2 ends of wire and 2 sides. Make one side positive and remember that as positive. Run your wire from speaker to amp. Now, on your speaker, take the positive wire (If you don't know whats what, take a double A battery, connect one wire from speaker to the possitive side of batter, and other on negative. if the speaker pops out, then thats positive, if pops in, then the wire thats on the negative side on batter is the possitive) and connect it to one of the channels in the amp. where it has a (+). then Negative from speaker to amp that has a (-).  You will need RCA's to run from amp to radio. these are the cables you plug into the amp and radio as if you would plug sound  into tv from dvd.. that type of cable but a bit different. It all depends on radio from there. But make sure you have your remote wire, your power wires all hooked up. I'm guessing you know what those are.  if not here we go<br>  <br>  <br>  Remote wire, thers a small area in the back of your radio(aftermarket is prefered!) it should say remote out. Plug it in there and run it back to amp then plug it in the amp that says REMOTE on it. That triggers the amp to turn on or off by the radio.<br>  <br>  Power. Get whatever gague wire(0 gauge is best cuz its least resistante    thats how ohms is accounted for) Run wire from battery to amp. Theres a big (+) opening on the amp. thats where power goes. Then for negative, (cuz you NEED both) take a few feet of the same gauged wire and screw it to bare metal on a car.  Unless you know and have everything you need its best to bring it to a car audio shop. No lie. they'll tune the amp (which i still need help with) and it will be all good.  Good luck though|`|44BEm1Uhaa	8 channel amp? 5x7 "Roadmaster" speakers? Hmmmmm!|`|uicbw4Eeaa	idk take it to a shop
5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	Our shop would charge $55. But if you can get the radio out of the dash (you didn't say what kind of coupe you have or I could give you a link to directions to remove the dash panel) they will have the same color codes on each radio. Just take note of where each wire is connected and connect the same color wire on the new unit to the same one in the car. If the existing radio was installed with an adapter harness then you will simply cut the adapter harness plug off of the radio plug and the adapter will be color coded to the new radio so you wire them together color for color then just plug it in. Other than that it just a matter of bending the tabs on the mounting sleeves to remove the old one and mount the new one. Good luck.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	If you are not good with cars or electronics, I suggest calling local car stereo places to get a quote on an installation.

AA10789216	When there is a misfire, it sends the unburned air/fuel mixture into the exhaust.  The oxygen sensor then reads this as a too lean condition, and the computer then adjusts the fuel mixture more rich.  When the computer gets to the limit (setting it as rich as it is allowed, given the measured air flow), then it sets a code for running too rich.      You may have a misfire.

Cars with bad fuel filters tend to act the way you describe, also a clogged catalytic converter, very common on GM models. Change your fuel filter. Then, buy a can of spray Gum-out and clean to factory new conditions the following: PVC valve and hose, throttle body, idle air control valve (located on the throttle body). The bouncing is probably due to failing strut cartridges, another common GM ailment. To get the best from your engine and trans, install a set of Bosch Platinum single point plugs, or Nippondenso Iridium plugs. These will burn fuel more effectively than the original AC units. You can run the Gum-out through the intake manifold, as well. If there is any crud built up inside your converter, this should blow it through and save you big $$$$.!!! Also, make sure that air flow is maximized around your radiator by power washing the space between the radiator and the A/C condenser. This area over time collect debris that inhibits proper engine cooling and can cause loss of power and mileage. Good Luck!!! E-mail me back with your results!
5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	You need to have the SWR set on the antenna. SWR stands for "Standing Wave Reflection" and relates to the amount of reflection your transmission gets off the body of the vehicle back into the antenna. You'll need an SWR meter, some CB's have them built in, to set the antenna. The procedures for setting it will vary depending on the type of antenna. Once you have an SWR meter, let me know what type of antenna you have and where it's mounted and I can explain further. If you get a seperate SWR meter not built into the radio you will also need a short 3 ft ant cable to connect it inline with the antenna cable at the back of the radio.  Continueing to use the CB or trying foil will result in damage to the CB so don't...until the SWR is set.

Putting antifreeze in the overflow bottle will not solve your problem unless you have a closed loop system.  You will know this: if your overflow bottle does not have a screw on cap, then it is not a closed loop system and you will need to fill the coolant system by means of the radiator.  Is the car overheating?  If so, you may need to have the problem checked out.  Otherwise, you may be losing coolant somewhere that is causing the steam from under the hood.  Hope this helps.

qjjmsNCxaa	It depends on the size of the combustion chamber in the head many 460's had large combustion chambered heads and adding a flat top piston would only slightly raise compression ratio say from8:1 to around 9.25:1 at those numbers pump gas would work fine,and would give you a slight power gain,you really need to know what heads you are going to use,and how you intend to use the motor,if you are using 1974 and up stock cast heads you should be fine with flat top pistons.|`|441079467ce415a17b70ee3db8a1c8d6aa	Long story short....  Flat top pistons increase the compression ratio meaning more power but also meaning an increased chance at detonation (requiring higher octane fuel).  Other ways to control CR is through the combustion chamber size in the head and even the use of head gaskets.  If it is a street motor that you want to run on pump gas, get the dished pistons.  If the motor is going to have any forced induction, like a blower, then get the dished pistons.  Not that I want to sound like a jerk, but if its a full race motor and you are on here asking this question, consult a professional engine builder....

f5ibT3WNaa	Sound like you might have a vacuum leak causing it to miss.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	fuel injector.|`|8ifKojOXaa	First off I'm wondering when is the last time you changed the gas filter bec they should be changed once a year.Another thing I'd check is the vac lines look carefully for any cracks or loose vac lines in the system, one thing you can do is have someone spray some soap and water along and on the vac system lines as you run the engine idling and if you see any bubbles etc that will be your leak.<br>   Be sure to try some fuel injector cleaner or gas treatment like Lucas in it too.<br>   Another common fault is the ignition coil , make up a wiring diagram of the spark plug wires going to the ignition coil , unplug them and unplug the plug in connector , check the plugs wiring , plus unbolt the ignition coil , look on it's housing for any cracks or bulges or dis-colouring , if you find any then that's the your problem the ignition coil is shorting out internally and faulty.<br>   Remember that many Dodge's use the same exact ignition coil and a do it yourself auto wreckers should have lot's of those vehicles on hand to pick and choose parts from cheap.<br>  <br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way it be a good idea to clean the connections on the ignition coil , plus check the PCV valve, air filter , gas pressure valve, plus you really should get a gas pressure tester , if the things I mention don't fix it , then you might have a weak gas pump etc. <br>   One last tip the gas pressure valve on those is located on the fuel rail and it not be a bad idea to pick up a couple of used ones or even a new one but new they run about 150 bucks plus taxes but they can cause a few different starting problems and running probs on your vehicle and it could even cause it to loose 65 miles or so per tank so try another one in it's place for sure.

gnUDSOzcaa	I bought my last car from an auction a couple of months ago. The process was pretty straightforward... you look at the cars, bid on the one you like and pay for it if you're the highest bidder. I got a Toyota Sienna for $3,500 and only have to gas up every two weeks. So, all in all, I would say I got a pretty good deal.|`|02e0f47a495270dc70fe735fca47ce21aa	These are actually one of the best deals you can find. But if you do find something you like you need to have the money in hand, because i guarantee you that the car wont be there at the end of the week. My friend did this and found a really nice mustang for about $2000, the car was actually worth about $5000. So yes I would definitely check into that more, and find local listings where you live. Also one more website you can check out is CraigsList.com they have alot of cars that are under priced
DyEIc0K8aa	I have been told the same thing... I only put 185,000 miles on one bough new and never did baby the thing at all. It is still on the road today and runs great. But by driving it that way you for sure won't get better gas millage. People tell me to take care of them and drive easy, but I put 3 to 4 times more mileage on my cars than they do. Only thing if my cars needs any kind of repairs, they get it and are still running while theirs are not.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	We used to go on road trips to blow the carbon out.  Avoid top speed for extended times.  It will not increase your fuel mileage.|`|dHMwuCHOaa	No it doesn't. In fact, going faster gives you more miles to the gallon.|`|HpwyYmoIaa	driving fast doesnt give you more miles per gallon, in most cars after 65 mph every 5 mph you drive faster lower your mpg by 5%, but it depends on how fast youre driving and how high youre engine is revving, if youre at higher rpms then yes it will wear down the your engine faster cause the internal parts are moving faster, and if you launch your car from a stop it will wear on the transmission and engine also so depending on the rpms and if you slow and speed up alot it will wear on your car|`|DAilkzubaa	In a brand new vehicle, you are supposed to fluctuate your speed often but not at full throttle. The thing that ruins engines the fastest is driving fast when your water temp is still cold. This causes the pistons, rings, and cylinder walls to wear very quickly- it will smoke and burn oil faster with reduced compression, power, and fuel mileage. Driving at highway speeds is better for your car than stop and go driving, just dont floor it cold everywhere you go.

It depends on power to a solenoid to release the park mechanism and it's not getting enough voltage to activate the solenoid and release the lock.|`|H8sqQxBbaa	Don't believe the other guy.    Even if your car can't start you should be able to shift it to neutral, as you can start any vehicle in park or neutral (neutral usually if you had run out of gas and you put more in).  However, you do sort of need the battery to start it lol.    I would be very surprised if the battery is the problem.|`|jTh226Ycaa	yes, when you apply the brake to shift out of park, the brake light signal also releases the shift interlock, if the battery is dead, the interlock will not release

McqWrHP5aa	I think the terms "sill" and "seal" are getting confused here.    The engine seals on the OHV engine fitted to your Ka are normally trouble free,  so I think we are talking about a sill here.    The sill is the metal part of the car that forms the basic frame for the floor of the car,  when you have the door open,  you will see a "Ka" scuffplate,  this is the top of the sill,  and it runs from the front to the rear of the car.    As this part of the car is subject to reasonable stresses it is made to be strong, however unfortunately where sill problems normally show is during an accident.  The seatbelt mounts are attatched to the sill,  and also as it acts as the frame for the vehicle it acts passively in a crash to asorb engergy,  but maintain the integrity of the floor.    I suggest popping the car into an MOT station and asking a testers advice,  because the rules are a bit complex for me to explain on here,  also just simple surface corrosion may not affect the integrity of the sill that much.  A bodyshop, or indeed any mechanic should be able to offer you advice regarding the safety of the item.    It does get quite complex, so I can't offer exact advice on here.  This is a common problem on the Ka, unforunately it means the rot is starting to set in, and you could have a sizable bill next MOT I'm afraid :(    Regards,  Andy|`|4LZY5eOQaa	If its an old KA seals will be the least of your problems look at the underside they are usually rotten.  Engine has seals as does the gearbox and the hubs, doors, tailgate,brakes etc  But the body shell has sills which are probably rotten is this what he is on about?|`|TqPpsGqvaa	There are so many seals in a vehicle, need more info.Take your vehicle to a shop that will give you a free estimate, they will explain to you whats needed .|`|rIzx4OEWaa	The seals run along the sides underneath the doors an run from wheel arch to wheel arch. It sounds more like he is referring to the sub frame which the seals should be attached an which you would use to sit your car jack in if you needed to jack the car up if you needed to change a tyre when it gets a flat or service the car.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	He probably means the engine main seals; either front or rear, or both. If they're "gone" or badly worn, the car will be leaking a significant amount of oil. Check underneath while it's parked. If there's a puddle, you have a bad seal. Dangerous to drive? Probably not...but very irresponsible. You need to get it fixed.|`|Rzs7rrbEaa	Well seals are used to hold back fluid, so I would imagine the engine or transmission.|`|5072c885a0d43b66b964ac86a027351faa	the way to tell is to get a hammer and tap along the seal if any rust shows or the hammer goes through then you have a major problem.
H8XpaaPDaa	this vid shows how cars are made. its from a show called "how its made"    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agGmDzJnB...    actually, they're making a ford windstar in the video which is a van. but cars and vans are pretty much made the same way.
i5lk5eN2aa	The thermostat on the 1.8L turbo is in the bottom of the water pump housing. You will need to change it from underneath the car but it is easily accessed and not difficult to change. Removing the splash shield under the radiator will give you clear access to the thermostat housing on the bottom of the water pump and you will have plenty of room to work. Remove the splash shield. Beside the thermostat housing there is a water pump housing drain plug. You can remove that plug to drain the water pump housing if you want to but it really is not necessary and if you remove that water pump drain plug you will need to replace the O-ring seal on it before reinstalling it. It is not even necessary to remove the radiator hose which is connected to the thermostat housing. Just put a drain pan under the thermostat housing and loosen the 2 bolts securing the thermostat housing to the bottom of the water pump housing and then lightly thump the thermostat housing with a hammer to jar it loose from the water pump and allow the coolant to drain into the drain pan until it stops. Then remove the 2 bolts securing the thermostat housing to the bottom of the water pump and drop the thermostat housing. Remove the old thermostat and the old O-ring seal and clean the O-ring seal groove. Place the new O-ring seal in the seal groove and be sure to install the new thermostat with the spring side of the thermostat facing UP INTO THE WATER PUMP HOUSING. And be careful not to over tighten the thermostat housing bolts because they strip easily. I don't have the exact torque specs on those bolts but I expect it would be about 80 to 85 "inch" lbs. Let your husband do the dishes. You can do the thermostat. Easily! Good luck.|`|m3MvChnwaa	stuff|`|H8sqQxBbaa	I don't know about the this specific model, but usually you find the thermostat where the top radiator hose goes into the top of the engine block.  Where that goes in is the thermostat housing.  Using a ratchet set, unscrew the two bolts on it and lift the housing off.    THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: Use a wire brush to scrape off the old gasket.  Make sure that the housing and the block are completely clean of the old gasket.    Take the old thermostat out (pay very close attention to how the old thermostat is setup in there).  Replace with the new thermostat.  Apply gasket sealant to both sides of the new gasket.  Let it sit on there for 2 minutes before placing the gasket on the housing.  Line the gasket up with the bolt holes.  Screw back on and your are done.

IXtiKaOYaa	NO;;;;;;;;  100/300  is maximum of $100k per person or up to $300K per accident.   ie;  if there are 10 people injured in an accident, the most the insurance will pay is $300k divided up by the 10 people based on their injuries.   ie;   1; $3k; ER, no other treatment.  2; 10K; ER, 2 months of physical therapy.  3; no injuries;  nothing  4; $50k broken leg, foot, surgery, lost wages, physical therapy.  5; 6; 7; minor injuries, pay $1k each  8; 2K; chiro treatment only  9; no injuries nothing  10; $100k; brain injury, spinal cord injuiy, never will walk again, will need further medical treatment for the rest of their life.   That is the scary part, since they can pay no more than $100k per person, but the medical bills will not even cover the $100k, so guess what, they will go after you for any asset you have.  ie;  equity in a house, savings etc.    So even though the total is less than $300k, they pay based on injury and the amount of your insurance.  Now 100K property damage.    This can be just as scary.  The most common accident is a rear end accident.  When you rear end someone, it is always your fault regardless of the reason.    The most they will pay for PD (property damage) is $100k per accident.   say for instance, you rear end 1 person, who is then pushed into someone else, then somenone else.  then is more common then you may realize.    The cost of autos is high.  Say each of these vehicles are BMW's, mercedes, high end cadilacs etc.  If the cost to repair or replace exceeds $100K, guess what, you will be responsible for the difference.    Just because you have a 2005 Jeep Liberty or a 1970 ford escort, never, and i repeat never lower you liability coverage, since if you have only the minimum and you have been found at fault for an accident, they will go after you;;;;;;;;;;;;to pay the difference.  Insurance companies only the maximum on your policy that is owed.      The only time you might want to lower your coverage would be for your Jeeps collision and/or comprehensive coverage.  This pays for the damage to "your" car only;;;;;;;As long as you have a loan on the jeep, you must have collision and/or comprehensive.  If your Jeep is paid for, or take off if the value of your vehicle is less than your premium for those coverages only.      I used to have 100/300/100 on my auto, till i became a claim adjuster and saw so many times, that this maybe not enough.  I then increased it to 250/500/250 just in case.  the difference in premium was about $20 per year.      Also, make sure you have uninsured and underinsured coverage on your vehicle, since you would be amazed how many people dont have insurance, or not enough.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	No. That's very good coverage.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	No way!  That is really good coverage to have, especially if you are in a bad accident - medical payments are very expensive!  If you carry the lower limits lets say 50/100/50 and you crash into somebody and cause $75,000 in injuries to one person you will be responsible for paying the other $25,000 to them.  They can garnish your wages to get that money too.|`|AA11435704	100/300/100 is what I would consider to be basic coverage. With the cost of medical care these days, it does not take all that much to exceed $100,000 in medical bills. If you were to hit a car with 5 people in it, you would only be covered for an average of $60,000 each..    Liability insurance is to protect you and your assets. If the cost of the damage / medical bills/ other losses exceed the coverage, you are personally liable for the difference. They can seize your wages, bank accounts and other assets to cover the difference.     You are not over insured. In fact you may want to consider increasing your coverage.|`|kZCgf4mYaa	You can compare how the insurance quotes would change, for example here - autoinsurance.maclenet.com

I would get.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	I've had three 4Runners and love them -- reliable, good performance, good sound systems, and great quality.     However, I would NOT recommend a large SUV like a 4Runner for a first car for a teenager. Why? Because they are hard to handle in an emergency situation -- top heavy and not very nimble.     Most teens think they are good drivers but they only have about 25% of the knowledge and experience needed to be a good driver. Being a good driver means more than passing a driving test and being able to keep the car between the white lines. When emergency situations occur, such as running off the road or avoiding other drivers, most teens have zero experience and don't know how to handle it. A large SUV makes it worse. Get a smaller car that you can handle and get some experience in. Then......get a SUV.|`|A19tIHk6aa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.maclenet.com|`|S4z7mefcaa	I've owned a couple of 4-Runners and just LOVED them.  I now have a Sequoia (which is the 4-Runner's big brother).  Aside from being very very reliable and safe, a 4-Runner is a joy to drive and the Limited has all the bells and whistles you need.  My last one was a V8 which wasn't great on gas but the V6 shouldn't be too bad.  My V8 was a 2005 and I liked everything about it.  It was great off-road and went through some pretty brutal Canadian winter driving with no problem.    I really can't think of anything bad to say about the 4-Runner.|`|GUmZuVFRaa	Your in highschool, thats a little too good for a first car.    I would have killed for my parents to buy me a car, and pay for gas and insurance.

The statistics about teenage drivers arent good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.    For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.    However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughters auto insurance in the future.    The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.    Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.    Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.    Did you know: If youre adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.

I have done the same engine swap (H22A) in my civic. It will cheaper and easier to do. But if you really must go with an automatic, then yes it can be done. But it's going to be more expensive and will probably require 2 different ECUs.   Good luck.
FgRUdQOBaa	Andy is 100% correct, size and efficiency of freight trains has increased, not the speed.     For the most part passenger trains are the same speed they were 50 years ago with some very notable exceptions, none of which are in the United States.|`|bda465ikaa	The train in southern california that connects San Diego to Los angeles is 49 ,mph including stops.   ---  I believe that the maximum speed of any Amtrak train with the exception of Acela is 79 mph.  ---  This is the same as it was in 1938 when the new equipment was delivered.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Most travel between 40 and 60 MPH.|`|WsKUEgQraa	For freight trains the answer would shock you! The average speed of a freight train hasn't really changed in 80 years.It was about 17 or 18 mph then and it's still the same now.As for passenger trains i'm not sure in America but i'm guessing it's slower than it was in the golden age of train travel.|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	There are a ton of variables that need to be addressed each trip to determine that particular train's "Maximum Authorized" speed.  Too many to list, but your average freight train out and running will most likely be restricted to no more than 40 mph.|`|rpUSdu1Eaa	Depends on the line, but overall I would say that the 17 and 18 seems about right. To clarify, though, there are some Amtrak trains that run at 90 MPH on former Santa Fe lines, such as the Southwest Chief and Pacific Surfliner.
328e52056e90a15c3247940d35d04602aa	Tell him that storing a car for a year without driving it will damage the car. If he still says no, try and talk his brother in to taking over the payment for the time you are gone. He can drive it while making the payments. It would be good for your wallet and the car needs the regular exercise to stay in tip top shape.|`|9AGTYeU7aa	The only way to get out of the loan is to sell the car. The car may be worth less than what he still owes on the loan. He may want to try to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate and longer term and the payment may come down quite a bit. He needs to talk to his bank about this to see if the car qualifies and if he can qualify for a refinance. Good luck.|`|LxRq2zYPaa	If your husband wants to keep it let it... I don't see why you are trying to interfere with his hobby. A guy who likes cars is like a guy with a dog. Would you let your dog go that easily?|`|lz4IIIGzaa	He can transfer the loan to a lower-interest bank loan.    Cars depreciate quickly. I bought one in 2001 for 10,000 and sold it in 2007 for 1,500.    Get him to look at what he could sell it for now (on eBay), and what he could sell it for in a few years' time (by putting in an older date). Then he'll see that storing cars is not worth it.    (Except of course, classic cars!!)
43DHFQnKaa	no you do not,  because the stock eaton was relatively mild boost-but you have other issues in respect to the very fine ram air-manifold system on your car.    there are supercharger installations specifically made for the mach 1 -  and are bolt ons -  which may be preferable and will get you up by 60% - 80% over stock,  therefore faster than the stock eaton.  http://www.lethalperformance.com/03-04-m...  http://www.lethalperformance.com/03-04-m...      if you want to do the eaton swap onto your car...  it has been done and can only suggest you get on an owners forum-like   http://www.svtperformance.com    or here is what you are trying to chase down    http://mustangboards.com/dyno-results/30...  http://www.californiafords.com/cgi-bin/u...    or this was i think is most interesting........  http://www.southfloridastangs.net/sfsfor...  ...especially this information - which i think may be the case.  e: Eaton Swap  Quote:  Originally Posted by chris  if im not mistaken and correct me if i am wrong but your car has a 4 valve motor it it does its gonna get tricky cause the compression it comes with from the factory witch i believe is 10.1 not boos t friendly you would have to either destroke the motor or get find out if the difeerence between you motor and an 03 04 cobra motor lies within the heads    yes and no really. The Mach 1 guys do it all the time. YOu dont need to do anything to the long block, just have a conservative tune and you should be fine. The motor is like 10.1 or so...the difference between the 03/04 cobra motor and his is the heads, pistons/ rods/ compression etc. They blower kit will bolt on, and make great power, but dont get greedy.    IMO, if you are looking to get the car supercharged for the least amount of money get a procharger or a vortech.....all the nickel and dime **** for the eaton will raise the price a lot. It involves a LOT more than just the blower.  **************************************...  in any event i think if you do a bit of research on mach1 forums- you will get an idea of where you want to go with the supercharger installation.  for sure it may be safe to say that unless you can to the installation yourself/have the skills/tools,  it will likely be far cheaper to do a bolt on installation (1 day labor plus you get a pro-tune).  ...if it were me - would keep the shaker set - up.........    cheers 04 cobra (whipple blower at 15lbs)  http://www.cardomain.com/member_pages/sh...

38c6373fd3b19e3800899c623919c0e0aa	l have a two-door, but it depends on your persona tastes. The longer wheel base is going to be better in off-road situations and the four doors are really nice if you plan of carrying passengers.    Transmission-wise, I would always recommend the manual. Much better suited for off-road. Mine is a five-speed. The manual will have more torque and better mileage, although Jeeps are not really known for great mileage anyway.    If cargo room is an issue, go for the four door. In order to get a medium-sized plastic tote into my back seat, I have to put it in through the passenger side. The seat on the driver side will only raise up so far, due to the steering wheel, and the tote won't fit into the back, between the seat and the roll bar.    Resale is great on any Wrangler. It's been in the top five for resale value the past several years too.|`|8pSr5c1laa	get automatic then you can concentrate more on off roading in it|`|LamVaAETaa	Personally i think all Jeeps suck. But i would take the manual more fun to drive.|`|3YzXWHwbaa	Jeeps are awesome - the manual versions are the most durable if you can shift.  2 door can get more places off road, but the 4 door can hold more stuff.  Automatic is my choice for the ease factor if you are going to drive it all over town up and down hills and such.  But manual is such fun in the mountains for off road or in the desert in the sand  and over rocks  for rock crawling.

SohrsIBoaa	lower gas mileage, and rougher ride.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	it will go BOOM!!|`|AA11201256	no, because of the turbocharger.|`|ZBVMT11maa	No the WRX can not run on anything less than 91oct. you can run your car on E85 after it is tuned for it. but 87 oct no, it can cause a knocking in your engien and cause further damage.|`|AA11652224	wrong...The WRX can run on 87 or 89. But be warned though, you will get lower gas mileage and lower power due to the unsatisfied compression ratio of that kind of gasoline. The only time you'd pump it with 87 or 89 is if you don't have any other kind of gasoline around, just stay out of boost and put in 91 or higher asap. In fact, you'd be saving money buying 91 because you'd lose money from the miles you don't get when using lower octanes.    The reason the RS can run on lower octanes is because its block and ecu are tuned for that (RS' have higher ratios).    To posters before me....WTF? since when does gasoline go through a turbo? honestly.....|`|7L0zp7O6aa	If you don't push it hard, it will run on 89.  The ECU will pull timing if tit detects detonation to prevent damage but the above poster is correct in that power and mileage will suffer.  Plus on a hot day, if you floor it, the computer may not react in time to keep the motor from blowing so I would avoid it.  Plus you say you save 10 cents a gallon but that's only like a buck a tank.  If you are hurting over a dollar a tank, you have the wrong car.|`|YRW9qfViaa	No dumb ***! U will runn the turbo. If not turbo maybe.|`|baQdcHRnaa	Well, there is nothing wrong if you want to save $$ these days.  But since you got a turbocharged engine, you can try the following and then switch to the 87 (or even lower, 86 in some southern states).    1.  Milage difference, try compare 91 and 87.  See if you gain any more miles by using 87.    2. If you have Dyno, try run with 91 and 87, see how the output and results are.    If you are very sensitive, by the time you run your car with 87 or 89, you will feel your subby is choking (and the response will slower).|`|Yjzbh3sKaa	YES, it will run fine on 87, 89 octane fuels.    You will have slightly less performance (acceleration), and slightly less gas mileage.  Generally the loss of gas mileage outweighs the savings in fuel cost, but try for yourself, every car is a little different.    It will NOT ruin your engine, turbo, or components.  The engine control unit can sense what fuel you are using by listening for knock.  Knock is when the lower grade fuel ignites before it is supposed to, and it is what can damage the engine.  By monitoring for it the ECU automatically adjusts for the best performance from whatever fuel grade you use.    The people who tell you not to use 87 grade are the same people to change their oil every 3000 miles...hah!
9cLykSGSaa	the protege has a rebuilded engine... ill go with protege is more cheap to maintain, repair the manual window is easy and cheap also and forget about the bumper that is just aparience of the car nothing that have to do with engine working or so    i know the ford will look much better than the protege, but in reliability ill go with mazda  because automatic trans on ford are not that good enough vs mazda  and mazda are more cheap to fix than ford    and for the mazda haters ford dont own mazda and in small cars ford dont make a single part for them so the protege is 100% japan made car|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Go with the Mazda. Im have heard that the Ford Contours don't hold up well.|`|HNl5V17aaa	i agree with mazda tech 100% ford contours our not very reliable an our known for there transmission failures very expensive to fix where talkin 1 to 2 grand if not more to fix if one fails on you,the mazda protege is a great car an will last you for a long while if treated right an our cheaper to maintain as iam a owner of a 94 mazda protege with 192,000 miles an the engine still runs like new the only flaw is interior room as you our a parent might have to look into an see if its enough space for you.
YhjFiVGyaa	its going to cost a lot....its going to cost around $2000-3000 to have it shipped there via boat and then a tax to egypt for 25% of the price you paid for the car.
skfHV92caa	I would not suggest driving 70 miles with an alternator problem.  The alternator is designed to keep your battery charged while the vehicle is running.  If you don't have a way to charge your battery, then eventually your battery will discharge.  The battery will only last for so long after driving some distance.  Your jumpbox is good for only jumpstarting your car.  If you use your jumpbox as your battery you will still end up with the same problem as your battery.  Your best bet will  be to replace your alternator.  Driving only on your battery constantly will eventually kill your battery for good and you will end up replacing the alternator and the battery.  Hope this helps.|`|GUmZuVFRaa	Don't even try it, you won't make it. Get it fixed.  The car could suddenly die while your in traffic(no more power steering), or going down steep hill(it will be much, much harder to brake and take longer to stop, plus no power steering).

6xEE1mswaa	did you use factory cap/wires? the cheaper brand caps get molded lines on the inside that are almost perfect places for the spark to arc over and short. There can be numerous causes for stumble. A cracked plug insulator, too wide of a gap. incorrect style plug or heat range; a weak ignition coil. Oil in the spark plug tubes. Lean or overly rich fuel mixture. Incorrect valve timing (belt jumped one tooth). Some testing and inspection will be needed to eliminate each of these causes. It would help to have an engine scope to see the spark pattern to possibly narrow it to one particular cylinder. It can get more expensive to just throw parts at it. Maybe time to take it in and let a shop check it. Good Luck--T&T|`|8ltSbpIjaa	Yeah what he said. It could also be a bad map sensor, or air flow sensor. While your at the shop get it scanned, for codes, and for missfires.
