Visually, it cuts your body into big chunks, then exposes you right across the worst possible section of your belly, drawing the eye to the LAST place you want  to draw attention to, even on a woman with a perfect body.  They make every woman look shorter, heavier, and less femininely shaped than they really are.  Is that what you want?<br>  <br>  <br>  THUMBS DOWN?  For telling the truth?  She wants to look good for this guy!

s63bm0Guaa	to me it looks like she probably has hair just past her shoulders, but then puts extensions in to add length. So to style, you will need a root lifter, and mousse. blow dry upside down until mostly dry, then shape with a large round brush. then add some back combing to keep the lift. and volumizing hairspray to hold.  Keep in mind you will need lots of shorter layers to achieve this look as well.|`|Br3k7Hagaa	poof it all over with slides same colour as your hair|`|TfEBIjxZaa	Scene hair style.<br>  <br>  She has extensions.<br>  <br>  Short choppy layers.<br>  <br>  Pulls her layers up to her bangs.<br>  <br>  Hair spray and teasing.|`|eTBfsjCUaa	She has extensions but if you don't want to do all that (Personally I hate them, I know they aren't real and I feel fake when I wear them) then just part your hair all the way to the side and blow dry and tease and the straighten your bangs.

And you have to tease it and use hairspray.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|blmRX9bwaa	The longer bits of hair will almost definitley be extensions. You can buy clip-in extensions which are the same colour as your hair, or get semi-permanent ones put in by a hairdresser. Due to the extreme-layer look, your hair can be quite short, although shoulder length works best with extensions. The hair is then fluffed up with gel or serum and set with hairspray. Clips may also be used to hold it in place, especially with the fringe.|`|f6igTsNjaa	straiten it, then comb it from the inside with a fine toothed comb going from botton to top only on the top layers!  hair spray each section after your desired life is accomplished.  You need hair al least to the middle of your chest for this look.  If you don;t have long enough hair, try putting in removabke extensions<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|bBT8icUNaa	Cut your hair in layers. Then spray in hairspray and flip and rub you finger in it.
C4v09PPsaa	smoky eyes .. use a grey kind-of colour!<br>  emphasise cheekbones, and clear lip gloss!|`|krIKhZzcaa	Just a loose powder if you don't have any blemishes. But if you do, use a foundation then a powder. Then use a black or charcoal eyeliner on your upper and lower lid. But make sure its a thin line. With you lips use a darker pink lip gloss, but not red.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|9D6Y4dYuaa	Hey there!<br>  <br>  A night out with the girls calls for show stopping looks! This is your time to be daring and try new trendy styles. When you were describing your eyes, I thought that you were describing mine! I have the same light blue, with a darker circle blue near the center, and honey colors right around the pupil. So, needless to say, I have tried lots of great ways to wear my makeup that will probably look great on you as well!<br>  <br>  Something that always works for me and is a very popular trend right now is the cat eyes look. You can achieve this by lengthening your liner and defining the creases of your eyes. You can create more or less drama just by using a longer or shorter sweep. Use this website as a guide:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-cat-eye-liner-liquid-liner-tips-neutral-eye" rel="nofollow">http://www.temptalia.com/tutorial-cat-ey...</a> <br>  <br>  Also, bright red lips are no longer a trend of the past. If you go with a subtle cat eye and a matte, strong red on the lips...it's sure to be a breathtaking combination. However if you do decide to go with an intense dark cat eye, go a little lighter on the lips. Strong lips and dramatic eyes have the potential to be overwhelming. Especially if you have light features. <br>  <br>  Also, if you want to be a bit diffferent, wear your hair in an up-do. Simple, messy buns are super chic and can showcase killer earrings. Often, ladies go to extremes trying to get their hair to fall in just the right way, or spend hours putting curlers in...when they could take 5 minuts to throw it back in a funky pony, and save half the time. It's just a suggestion. Take a look at this video for some ideas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.about.com/beauty/Quick-and-Easy-Updo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://video.about.com/beauty/Quick-and-...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps and have a fabulous time.<br>  <br>  Stay classy!|`|bBT8icUNaa	Blue eyes look questionably good with smoky eyes so take charcoal or black possibly even blue eyeliner and make a thin line by starting in the middle of your lid going to the outer corner. Then start from the middle again and go to the inner corner, making a thin straight line. Then swipe some dark gray or silver eyeshadow on the lid of your eyes. Then take a berry color lipstick, rub some on finger and roll it on your lips. Take A little bit of bronzer or golden eyeshadow and rub a small amount on the high part of your cheekbones. Hope I helped|`|a5VUy6giaa	try white eyeshadow or eyeliner this will make your blue eyes stand out loads and for your lips id use a shimmer but not glittery look whether thats lipstick , gloss or a nice balm and natural foundation and darker cheeks!
VFWQjUyraa	Yes, you could wear a mini with stilettos, but under certain conditions. I'd have to say I see where that answer came from about the, "great, now go whistle in the street." It would look good with slightly shorter heels, but if you're going to wear a super short mini, you'd be best wearing tights or leggings with them, or maybe just flats. If you want to wear the stilettos, I would go with a bit longer of a skirt. A tastefully sexy (and not slutty) length of a mini would hit no higher than 4 inches above the knee. If you want the appearance of longer legs, you can go with a pair of high-waisted boot cut jeans with those heels, or wide leg jeans (and a fitted top) with your stilettos.|`|Id1ypViXaa	i would wear sandals or bare feet|`|hnhb119Laa	Its all I  ever wear with mini's... but 5" heels are just too big for my small feet without platforms.|`|9UD7mmgfaa	Go for it.  I wear 4" heels daily.  If hubby and I go out on a date, I will wear stilettos (4-6" heels) with a mini.  Good luck and have fun!|`|2QUkfmp9aa	heels and mini skirts is very sexy!|`|E4pXTZ5Naa	High heels and mini skirts....I'm sorry, but the only image I get with that combination is that of a 40 year old housewife from the OC still wishing she was 20.<br>  <br>  Not to mention it's so...'90s.<br>  <br>  Just because you're proud of your physique doesn't mean you have to give it all away and show every bit of it off. Try toning it down a little...leave some to the imagination. Otherwise you just come off as a cocky slut with nothing more to share. I mean, skirts 2 inches below your crotch? That's far too much. You need to retain at least SOME class to keep people's attention.<br>  <br>  Try some knee high boots and a bit longer skirt that you didn't buy in the kid's department. People will still see that you have nice legs, but the fact that you aren't coming off as "easy" and showing every bit of you to every Joe, Jack, and Tom will be even more attractive.|`|WwVHWz5saa	With your physique it's okay I think. It depends on what makeup you wear and your hair as well. As soon as you say 'stilletos and high heels' we all think of those drunk woman stumbling around with enough makeup on to make her highly flammable and hair that is straightened so much that it's fried at the ends, and with large thighs. But of course you could be completely different and be elegant etc. It just depends on what else you wear with it. I'm sure you team it with somehting tasteful, good luck :)|`|v8pl2RLUaa	Sure it would look great.  I have gf that is about ur size, and she pulls it off all the time.

mhyL7Qw3aa	You may not be moisturizing the right way for your skin type. If you have dry skin there is a way to moisturize that will help your foundation go on much easier and it won't flake. All you do is apply a medium size amount of lotion on the back of your hand, and with your pointer and middle finger tap the lotion on your face. This leaves a little bit extra moisturizer on your face so that your skin stays soft and moisturized. You might also want to change the kind of lotion you are using. Since you have dry skin you want to use a thicker moisturizer so that your skin will stay moisturized. I have dry skin as well and I use baby lotion because it smells good, it's pretty thick, my skin feels really soft with it on, and it helps my foundation go on much easier.|`|gqZal7NPaa	Try a good face mask or buy some cream for dry skin <br>  you can usual get some cream outta the doctors<br>  for dry skin or buy some cream for your face in town <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|ozWi3TJlaa	You need a mild exfoliator.  It will remove the dead skin cells and not harm your skin.  There are so many out there that I'm not sure which to suggest because I don't know that much about your skin.  Look on the labels for one that is specifically made for your skin issues (too dry, too oily, etc.)  <br>  <br>  Exfoliate after you wash your face a couple of times a week.  Then try using a damp facial sponge to apply the foundation.|`|UOEaWvvraa	i have the exact same problem ! it drives me mental i put so much moisturizer on and all i get is a tonne of zits!<br>  <br>  email me if you get a Solution to this problem|`|maEk3Ui1aa	i have the same promlem too<br>  can you email me as well if you get an answer please<br>  thankss<br>  x|`|yl0CZsy2aa	you might  be exfoliating too much.  once a week is good in winter. try letting moisturizer soak in first.|`|zCEDncdeaa	let the moisterizer soak in first.

Zo4TDZD4aa	Yes you can get it pierced again. I actually just got mine pierced a week ago from today. Im a germ a phobe so i know how you feel. Make sure when you get it pierced you clean it in the shower with unscented antibacterial soap. Also to keep it clean through out the day you can use contact solution to run over it to keep it cleaned. only move it when the shower water is warm and makes it easy to move to clean it. ALSO...when i got mine pierced they gave me sea salt to soak on my belly button. <br>  <br>  How to do this(and it makes it feel better and keeps it clean): <br>  Take a pinch of sea salt (you can buy this at your local walmart) and add it to a little shot glass or bathroom dixi cup. use warm water and put in on your belly button and lay down. do this two times a day for ten minutes for two weeks.<br>  <br>  If you get it done..hope this helps. <br>  <br>  -K

I would ask her why she still persists in going into PRIVATE draws despite you saying no. If her mother cannot understand that you are intitled to have private draws then i would lock them - can she understand that it's wrong to take others possessions without asking?. I would also think about asking them to leave.

I was an 80s child and when I was a teenager the Daisy Dukes were hott lol :)  So you just take an old pair of jeans and cut them about 2 inches longer than you want them to be, then fray the edge with a hairbrush.  Or if you want it to be finished instead of frayed, go to the craft store and pick out a thread the same color as the rest of the stitching and sew under the first inch of the bottom of the legs. Folding the edge under and ironing makes it easier to keep things in place while you sew. If you don't sew like so many ppl, just cut them off and take them to a tailor to sew under for you. It won't cost too much.|`|rXInAcURaa	<a href="http://www.hollisterco.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/category1_11308_10201_12598_-1_12552" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollisterco.ca/webapp/wcs/sto...</a>|`|axfCCEooaa	topshop have denim hotpants in all different shades for around ￡20|`|uaPR4F8kaa	topshop<br>  newlook<br>  miss selfridge<br>  they are all pretty cheap to.

ZDqdYhdGaa	I am not sure that I fully understand what you are saying, but I think that you are asking if putting hairspray on your hair will make it curly again and the answer is no not at all. I have curly hair and putting hairspray in it holds it in its place.<br>  <br>  Just be careful and make sure that you hold the bottle/can away from your head and spray light with it, otherwise you will end up with hard crunchy hair.|`|s63bm0Guaa	use an aerosol hairspray they go onto the hair lighter than a pump spray. <br>  your hair wont curl up. so you can tease, and hairspray if you want.|`|jez0O0bXaa	The teasing will hold your hair in place.

Maybe even use a deep cleanser. Then heat a needle. Using a magnifying glass try and find the original pore that is infected. Pierce the pore with the heated needle. Remove the needle and and then squeeze the pimple until blood flows. Be careful! now that the pore is open it can get infected again so close your pores by pressing a clean wash cloth with very cold water onto your face for several minutes.

When i first dyed my hair when i was 11 it didn't really work coz my hair was a browny/blonde and i rushed into dyeing it pure blonde and it just turned it gingery colour, so make sure you go down in a scale for example: if your brown the hair dye you may choose will be Light brown, if your light brown the dye you may use will be light ash blonde, and then, Honey blonde, then light blonde, do you get me? lol. But you will definatly suit blonde. Good Luck!..x p.s. Yur very pretty.x oh and your hair is the length of mine, so it's best to use 2 boxes of hair dye if you want to get best results but i only use one box and it works for me! .xx :)
N6aJoqTwaa	I love being bare foot|`|INJSpV4haa	Foot-phobics and prudes aside, there is zero wrong with going barefoot anywhere and everywhere.<br>  <br>  Walking barefoot is natural, comfortable, sensual, spiritual, liberating, ecological and is great fun. It's not dangerous as long as you use common sense and keep your eyes open, and dirt washes off easily.<br>  <br>  Shoes are hateful, germ-infested prisons!|`|LgxVVDWraa	Hawaiian and other Polynesian people, including me I'm Guamanian|`|LhafPeY1aa	Me, I am barefooted most of the time|`|e45f658f9932624abf10e836e95d3bd3aa	There is nothing wrong with being barefoot all the time To the contrarybeing barefoot promotes healthy development of musculature in the feet and legs, while excessive reliance on shoes tends to promote atrophy and weakness in those same muscles. This suggests that overdependency on shoes can have serious consequences. A study published in the September 2006 issue of Arthritis and Rheumatism found that “modern shoes may exacerbate the abnormal mechanics of lower-extremity osteoarthritis.”  Researchers concluded that maybe it was time to re-evaluate our daily walking programs, <br>  presumably to include time for walking barefoot. <br>  Walking barefoot is also a good way to avoid athlete’s foot. Contrary to a widely believed myth, it is not the sole-to-ground contact that presents a risk so much as it is feet going back into the moist, dark, warm environment found inside shoes. Closed-toe shoes especially are ideal incubators for fungi and bacteria to live and breed. Allowing the feet to “breathe” also prevents foot odor.<br>  Any overview of health issues regarding bare feet must include the developing feet of children. Dr. Lynn Staheli, who directed the orthopedics division at the Children's Hospital in Seattle for 15 years, documented that children raised in parts of the world where shoes are rarely worn had better flexibility, mobility, and strength, which resulted in fewer foot-related problems and injuries. In the 1960 classic “Take Off Your Shoes and Walk,” chiropodist Simon Wikler notes that children who go barefoot regularly develop stronger, healthier, and more functional feet than children who are generally shod. (He notes that a “constantly shoe-wearing tenderfoot” is rarely able to comprehend the innate capability of the human foot.) The following site covers such topics as when and when not to let children go barefoot, what doctors think, and parental testimonials. It also features excerpts from “Take Off Your Shoes and Walk.” <br>  <br>  “And forget not that the Earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.”            Kahlil Gibran|`|69PoS4sIaa	its not wrong jsut thati think everyon e should put shoes on when you go to the restroom <br>  i have four males in this house and they pee all over the toilet and they leavve pubic hairs it gross <br>  to think that they are on your feet when you climb into bed|`|6qVpZSosaa	I wear shoes round town and out and about but if I ever go on holiday to abersoch the streets are fine and everyone dusnt wear shoes.

You also have to remember getting a hairstyle from a picture isn't always what you end up with from the stylist. Some hair cuts do not look good on some people.|`|m1QQwnSdaa	yeah! i think you could pull it off :)|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	Actually I think it would look great on you! Just be prepared that the hairstyle will take a while every morning to get to look like that, and make sure a professional who knows what they are doing is the one cutting it. <br>  <br>  That hairstyle is also a cut that you should have your stylist show you exactly how to get it that way. It will take blow drying it a certain way, and some backcombing, hairspray, and using a hair straightener every day to get it to look like that. <br>  <br>  It will look great on you; just be prepared that it will take work. (Once you get the cut and are styling it everyday, eventually it won't take you much time to style it as you get the practice and zip right through it.) <br>  <br>  It isn't a style that you can just let air dry and walk out the door with. But it is worth the effort everyday!|`|Dbj8pU8haa	It could work but it might be a little shorter than you would like it at first.|`|lGSbjuIuaa	haha it might take alot of work to get it to look like that, but sure!|`|Wa44n8RCaa	yes but it is very high maintenance. any one can pull of a fringe/bang and u have the hair colour for it maybe not the legnth. ur gunna need hari straightners|`|zmPkO02Xaa	Yeah, this style would look great on you.

My stylist never uses a brush, just her hands. Also its because your hair was just cut so the split ends aren't there to frizz out.<br>  to the idiot below me. the cold blast of air doesn't lock in style. Its so you don't scorch your hair and if you do it properly it is suppose to make your hair seem soft. Its the same if you turn on the cold just before you step out of the shower and let your hair air dry. Your not a hair stylist you just stole what the others said before you. The type of hairdryer isn't important as long as you dry your hair like the others said from the root down. The type of shampoo is important but an amateur could tell you that.|`|a162de189aa1c1becbdbb0cd4b7cd67caa	use a round brush<br>  if you want you can use mousse before you start to give your hair some volume if you have naturally limp and flat hair.  if you have volumunious hair already skip this step.  <br>  put your hair in sections and start from the layers underneath<br>  do about two inch sections and use a low-medium heat (anything higher will more than likely damage your hair, which will make it more frizzy)<br>  brush it out and hold the hair dryer pointing down on the hair (pointing up will cause flyaways) and go slowly from the roots to the ends holding the brush underneath the section of hair you are drying. <br>  depending on the length of your hair (mine is just about 4 inches passed my shoulders) it will take about 40 mins by yourself.|`|s63bm0Guaa	Hi there,<br>  at all starts at the sink, you want professional shampoos and conditioners. Then chose the proper styling aid for your look. <br>  as for the blow dry, on your blow dryer it will have a pointed nozzle it may already be on your dryer, or it might be one you can take on and off.  This piece of equipment is very important, it acts as a smoothing device by keeping the cuticle of the hair smoothed down....always keep that pointed down your hair shaft while drying, never blow dry against the grain basically, always take your hair in sections, use the heat on your blow dryer while drying, then always blast a shot of cold over the section that your just blow dried, but still keep blow drying in the shape you want to see the hair fall. The cold air locks in the style, shine, and keeps frizz out!|`|JlwDnHTOaa	Get a round brush roll up to top of roots.<br>  blow dry from roots down.<br>  <br>  do all over.<br>  <br>  and wallah!|`|0N2hv5nOaa	Blow from the roots down.

iHna2K7Gaa	Are you wanting to know how to cut it or how to style it?<br>  <br>  If you want it to look right, you have to cut it that way first. Usually it involves long hair with big side-swept bangs and lots of short layers near the crown. There are a lot of pictures if you just type 'scene hair' into Google search.<br>  <br>  As for styling it, straighten or blowdry your hair straight if it's not naturally that way. Then, get a good rat-tail comb and tease the crap out of it (lol). If you don't know how to tease hair, there are lots of tutorials online if you just do a search for 'how to tease hair'. Anyway, tease out those shorter top layers, while keeping the bottom longer layers straight. Then, spray it all up with hairspray, and you should be good to go! :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|zlXofrG4aa	Lots of layers and crazy colours!

Yy7HRYDyaa	i had really bad acne all over my back last year, and it is getting a huge deal better now. i went to the doctor and he gave me a prescription fluid type thing, called 'zynerit'. it smelt revolting, all acidic, but my god it did a good job. go to the doctor and ask what they recommend, or go to a chemist and ask for advice. you can always get a few different products and see which works best. 'superdrug' do a great gel called 'clarity', which works well.<br>  for scars, i find the best method is actually sun-bathing! it works brilliantly for me!<br>  <br>  i hope this help you hun|`|rjsB4oDkaa	clean and clear advantage acne spot treatment!|`|dfMDTTUAaa	i went to my GP about acne and was prescribed with Benzoyl Peroxide 5, apparently it is the best thing for acne.

NOSWANvNaa	First and cheaper option: take a hair dye nerarest your natural color and dye your hair. be sure to use a clarifying shampoo to get out all previous color you can.<br>  <br>  Second and most expensive option: take it to a professional and you'll be walking otu with your hair the way you expected!<br>  <br>  <br>  You could use the same kit and redye at the patches! BUT, it might still show through a little patchy. <br>  <br>  Your very best bet is proffessional!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!! :D|`|xS1fLOueaa	Dye your whole head the same color to even it out. Darker colors like black and brown look more even when dying over another color.|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	Your best bet!............Go to a hairstylist. By you trying to fix it yourself, you will probably end up doing more color damage and risk really damaging your hair. <br>  <br>  If we were meant to be able to buy a box and dye our own hair, we wouldn't have stylist's in this world. Please go pay the money to get it fixed. I would hate you to be added to the list of people I see walking down the street who have obviously terrible hair color because they either tried doing it themselves, or they went to someone who didn't know what they were doing.<br>  <br>  And adding another note after reading some other answers: Do Not try to dye it all one color if the highlights you tried putting in were blond. The highlights will still come through, if not right away, than within a week. And you will be lucky if the highlights don't turn red when you try dying your whole head brown (which is what will most likely happen)!|`|UbFGfzehaa	take it to a professional|`|Wh29YEGUaa	well then redye your hair one soild color or just live with it...
mhyL7Qw3aa	You can do it with a bronzer but it has to be matte, you can find a matte bronzer at CVS or Walgreen's. All you have to do is take a blush brush and dip it into your bronzer and brush it under your jaw. You can also place it a little bit above your jaw line for that defined jawline.|`|bBT8icUNaa	Try doing curly hair that hugs your face|`|QkhiRa7Qaa	contour and use tons and tons of bronzer
53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	go visit some tattoo studios and have a chat with the artists,(they don't bite....usually :o) )they can give you some great ideas,you can look through what they have,also this way you can see for yourself just where you can have it.this way you get to see if you like the work of the person who will do your tattoo.take your time and don't be rushed into it,that way you will get just what you want<br>  luck|`|zgDQrI2uaa	Personally, if you are just getting a tattoo to get a tattoo, I would hold off.  Just mo, but I think you should get a tattoo that has some personal meaning behind it and not just a picture for the sake of having a picture.  For example, perhaps there is someone you loved who has passed on who was fanatical about pink roses, you could get a pink rose Ed Hardy style.  That tattoo would mean more to you down the road than getting a fairy just because it's cute.<br>  <br>  Also be careful choosing your artist, my first tattoo was done by some guy whose style didn't mesh with mine.  I like black and grey and small details, while he loved color and used thick lines.  Needless to say my custom tattoo is not exactly how I want it and I am so disappointed.|`|QikvnTnqaa	Don't get it unless it is "the" tattoo. If it's not something personal, something that means something to you....don't get it. I decided to get a tattoo last year and it took me 6 months to figure out what I ACTUALLY wanted and to get the  design right. I love my tattoo. I'm glad I waited. :D<br>  <br>  Don't just get it to get it. Make sure you love it! :D|`|6LJzt2ngaa	it has to mean something to you for sure. and you gotta be proud. but maybe if you plan on being a teacher, probably not like a naked sailor lady. hahaha. im sure most people wouldnt mind seeing it if it just happens to show, tattoos are so common now a days. maybe on your fore arm? that way wearinng long sleeve shirts would hide it. but you could definately show it off by wearing short sleeves. or youre chest. cant really show that in a school building anyways. haha. but good luck. it would be easier if i knew what it was you wanted?|`|tO5TBKNraa	Get a small one and get it on your upper back. something like a flower. you don't want it to represent too much because you could change your thoughts about stuff like that. like you could get a cross and then become an atheist.|`|QsC3qGkOaa	i love guys with no tattoo. clean and more sexy to me. <br>  if you want to have one better show it off, coz tattoo is an art why hide it anyway! or better not have one as it sounds useless when hidden..|`|n7NgsKxlaa	hey hun. i turned 16 and my birthday present was a tattoo. i designed my tattoo the summer before my birthday. i thought about getting the tattoo for about 6 months before i got it done. when choosing a tattoo you should get it done somewhere that is easy to hide, like on your chest, back or leg, so it can easily be covered up.
6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Its sad. So little respect for herself, so little confidence that she would try to hide behind wires and studs etc. Its not that I don't like face piercings, I find them repulsive.|`|zlXofrG4aa	That's like asking 'guys what do you think of a girl who wears white, v neck tees?' or 'who has brown and red hair?' or 'wears green eyeshadow?'.<br>  It's about who likes the piercings and who doesn't.  Everyone has their own opinion and preference about them so why even bother.

OuOOy8v3aa	1. To make your foundation looks flawless you need a good quality foundation, I use mabalyne minerals, then a just brush it on evenly.<br>  Go into a different light after you've applied it so you can get an even View of what it looks like.<br>  <br>  2. My friend has light skin tone blue eyes and dark red hair and she tends to wear black kohl liner and a little bit of pale green or dark blue.<br>  <br>  3. I used to have my hair straight and i used to pull it out to the sides when I did it, then it just ended up kind of out. All you need to do is pull it right down at a vertical angle. Mousse also helps keep the hair in place after it has been straightened.<br>  <br>  4. To get non clumpy lashes you need a non clumpy mascara. Most mascaras go clumpy because you pump them and air gets in. All you need to do is get a good quality mascara and not pump it when you put the brush back in.<br>  <br>  5. My eye line used to come of on my bottom lid all the time but now i put a black powder on before i apply the kohl liner and it stays on nearly all day.|`|QGU7JAIUaa	1. To make foundation look flawless use a brush like MAC's 187 and gently buff a small amount of foundation into your skin. Try not to over use, as it will make your skin look unnatural and cakey. Make sure your foundation is blended properly on your jawline otherwise it can look mask like. Its also good to invest in a good foundation some good brands are MAC or Chanel. Go to your local MAC or large boots store and have your shade that matches your skin tone tested on you. Finish your foundation off with a spray like MAC fix +. This will make your foundation look flawless.<br>  <br>  2.  Good eyeshadow colours which would suit light skin and blue eyes would probably neutral colours like cream, light browns, beiges and pinks. I would reccommend MAC for eyeshadows as they have about 100 colours and are highly pigmented and easy to apply.<br>  <br>  3. To keep hair straight throughout the whole day i would invest in some good hair straighteners like GHD's. If your hair is still prone to being 'flicky', then i would use some straightening shampoo and conditioner. Follow with a smoothing balm and some heat protection spray.<br>  <br>  4. To avoid clumping eyelashes, invest in a good mascara. When applying the mascara, gently wiggle the brush from side to side and then comb your eyelashes through with an eyelash comb.<br>  <br>  5. To keep your makeup lasting longer, use a primer. Whether it be mascara, foundation, lip or makeup primer it'll help makeup stay on longer and keep it looking fresh. Depending on the brand it can also sometimes make it look better. <br>  <br>  x|`|d4ktzRB1aa	1. Use Bare Minerals...its truly the most amazing face make up ever! I'll never go back to cakey makeup. Its made from pure minerals in the earth and makes your skin look absolutely flawless, my best friend got me hooked. It comes with a tutorial kit and DVD. You can fins it at sephora<br>  <br>  2. Use earth tones, like brown, gold, pale pink<br>  <br>  3. Before straightening your hair use a good product that will prepare your hair for no frizz. Just walk down the isle at CVS<br>  <br>  4. Use an eyelash curler and get mascara that lengthens. You only need to use one coat or else it clumps<br>  <br>  5. Put under eye concealer on before you put on your eyeliner and DON'T use black, it will overpower your fair skin and eyes...it will make your eyes like alot smaller.

About straightening your hair: if you have it layered, or even just one small layer at the bottom, it will tend to flip out.  to help this, after you wash your hair, put in a straightening serum and then blow dry it straight with a paddle brush before blow drying.  About your eyeliner lasting longer, apply an eyeshadow primer and rub it all over your eye and lashes before applying make up.  hope i helped! :) please answer my question! thanks!!|`|Bc8CygPIaa	I'll have to agree bare minerals is awesome!

jez0O0bXaa	Probably not. As a mom of now young adults I always let them have their freedom with their hair styles.  My son had shoulder length hair until 4th grade when he chose to cut it. When he was in high school he grew it out long again.  It's part of finding who you are and being comfortable with yourself. My daughter also has been highlighting since 4th grade and was taught at that age how to use makeup properly so as she got old enough to use it she has always looked classy not trashy and is now stylist just like mom.  I feel because I let them experiment young they never went too extreme with their looks.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Just let them know that you hate the results; it makes you feel terrible.|`|AA11659150	Hm.  I would say that it depends upon how long you want to grow it and how old you are.  I think that if you approach your parents with a realistic (and still clean cut) version of longer hair, and if you do it in a mature manner (instead of whining to them or pitching a fit about it) than they might listen.  I will say that your parents will win the battle if this is something very important to them.  And, not to encourage you to rebel against them, but you will be older one day and able to choose for yourself how you style you hair.  That being said, if they are forcing you to have your hair shaved very short and you don't like it, you could certainly try to negotiate - for example what if it is simply shorter than the top of the back of your collar?  I myself, wouldn't go for truly long hair on my son (if I had one) or my husband, but there are ways for young men and grown men to have "longer" hair that is still clean cut and well kept.  See if they will talk to you about it tonight at dinner.  Remember, you may still not win the battle and that will be the end of it, but approaching them in a mature manner (and maybe with pictures from magazines of what you have in mind), might allay their fears of having a son that looks like a hooligan.  :)  It is important that you do have some control over your appearance, as it is your body.  Your self esteem can suffer if they make all your decisions for you.  You might make a deal with them that if we try it, and you really think it's that bad or that it is out of control, I will agree to cut it, but I'd rather try doing this... etc.  Just remember, most parents will recognize when their children begin to grow up and want to make decisions for themselves.  This is positive, not negative!  The calmer and more mature you are when you approach them (and the better you have your thoughts laid out to make your argument - make notes if you need to -) the more likely they are to consider and acquiesce to your request.  Be sure to remind them that you'd like them to listen to your side of the issue entirely before simply saying no and dismissing your concerns.  GL|`|cQvE4orcaa	tell her that you are not happy with the results and to find a new barber or ask your friends to recomend where they get their hair cut if you like their hair after they get it cut. and if your mom is really stubborn start like a survey of something to see who likes your hair after a cut and who does not .|`|O5LItEFRaa	tell her that it's your hair and that you don't have to go if you don't want to.<br>  tell her that you should be making your own decisions.<br>  or just suck it up and go, hair grows back.|`|5JbARGHraa	Be over dramatic about it. <br>  Say that when you get your hair cut you lose self confidence and bribe them with something. Say you'll get a good grade on a test, or you'll help more around the house.|`|nd6r6nOvaa	Say you get picked on when your hair is short!!|`|OLaHR3BIaa	RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!! jk! i don't like long hair on boys maybe try going 2 a different barber place and ask them for a cut that U want or maybe just grow it a tiny bit and see if u even like it! i hate it when i get my hair cut because the hairdresser that i go 2 can cut my hair but it only looks good if i straighten it! then its like standing in front of the mirror 2 hours lol|`|ilx6DeVYaa	maybe ask her to let you try it one time the way you want, and if it doesn't work, then at least you tried. but really, if your parents want to take you to the barber shop, you can't really tell them not to. parents have the upper hand, i'm afraid. sorry dude|`|xS1fLOueaa	You should ask your parents if you can just let it grow out once. They might like how it looks. If they don't agree, ask if you can pick out the cut and length.|`|54TN7FW3aa	no you should listen to them good parents just be gay if you want long thats what girls are for for long hair and guy short  ***** sorry but true...........................|`|AA10245205	I really hate suggesting this, but sometimes you have to shoot for a bribe just like parents do.  You know, when they use things like, "If you clean the garage, I'll buy you a ______ ." (fill in the blank)<br>  Well, you might try a reversal on them.  For example, "If you let me have my hair the way I want, I'll keep my grades up, keep my room clean, mow the lawn, wash your car, " etc.  Use whatever you think will work with them - every parent is different.  <br>  Also, you should remind them that it's your hair and you have to wear it every day.  Tell them that you would never dream of telling them how to cut their hair, because how they wear their hair is up to them - therefore, how you wear your hair should likewise be up to you.  <br>  Lastly, if nothing works, don't throw a temper tantrum.  Just accept it and move on.  You're a young man and as such, you need to understand that life includes a whole lot of doing things that you don't want to do.  The more maturely you behave about it will eventually show your parents that you are growing up and they'll ease up on the rules.  The more you behave maturely and responsibly in general, the more they'll trust you to make your own decisions.  <br>  When I was growing up, I was fortunate enough that my parents didn't care one whit how I wore my hair or how I dressed - whatever was fine with them.  But most of my friends' parents were relatively strict, so I can still understand where you're coming from.
ZqHqKDqEaa	I totally understand your concern and frustration about your hair as well as finding a good hairdresser. <br>  <br>  To answer your questions, the relaxing time frame seems to vary among professionals. A good rule of thumb is every 6 - 8 weeks to avoid over processing the hair. When you feel the roots, is there new growth? By this time frame your roots should begin to get rather wavy. With proper conditioning it helps to minimize the unruliness. <br>  <br>  That is good to hear that your hair has since re-grown and sounds like it is doing rather well. In this case if I were you, I would merely say to the hairdresser I'm not trying to imply that you don't know what you are doing. Explain what happened at your last hairdresser and express your concerns of not having the hair relaxed too often. If this person knows what they are doing and value you as a customer they should take the time to explain to you, why they feel it is/isn't time to relax your hair. I think if the roles were reversed they would want someone to take the time to explain what is going on. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|XSHWYBcWaa	I get my relaxer every 6 weeks but i know some people who wait up to six months.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should wait until you see some new growth.|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Relaxers aren't really good for the hair and if you can cut down on them per year then your hair and scalp will be healthier because of it. Some people can go longer without relaxers and as long as it's not to the point that your hair starts breaking off then go as long as you can.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.longhaircareforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.longhaircareforum.com</a> - has many people who regularly stretch their relaxers. Stretching is when you go longer than "normal" without getting a touch-up. You can get some advice and tips from them. If you dont' want to do it then don't.|`|yH39NEXSaa	It depends on how course your hair is. If you have very thick and course hair six weeks is a good length of time. If you have medium to fine hair six weeks is entirely too often. I have fine hair I only get a relaxer every three months.<br>  <br>  If your stylist thinks it's time for another relaxer, and you are not ready for one, just simply say "No, thank you." Just because he is your stylist doesn't mean he can't be wrong and you have to do everything he says!|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	hmmm can't really help you out on this because I dont know how black people take care of their hair.

So don't go to the somber route with black jeans or pants, but dark blue denim works or even distressed jeans and then any color t-shirt that picks up the black and beige colors.  You can always go with a sweater for a sophisticated look or a t-shirt with a cool logo on it with brown and black and tans.  The shoes are up to you, but stay away from anything black. I'd wear something in leather though, maybe some nice Dock Siders in brown or even some neat boots depending on what type of weather situations you live in.  I like a casual dressed down look but I love to see a guy in sharp looking put together looks too.

teETSGmNaa	baking soda gets rid of odors<br>  try using that|`|wF3Znuodaa	washing it too much causes you oily glands to produce more oil. therefore you get an oily scalp. wash it just once a day. its the problem persists add apple vinegar to your shampoo (not so much that the smell of the vinegar will overshadow the smell of the shampoo). Use it everyday until you see a difference. then use it less and less often. also changing shampoo brand is very bad for your hair because it alters you natural pH levels. for this problem stay away from pantene, and fructis (they tend to leave behind a lot of residue (especially pantene!!). use shampoo that had the sole function of cleaning hair.<br>  hope this helps.|`|myCyhsouaa	I wouldn't shave it; try washing your hair with mineral water from the bottle once a day, only once. You could be over-drying your hair and it may be trying to over-compensate with more oil and grease.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Paul Mitchell has products with tea tree oil in them that should help.

VrJ0H6OGaa	Sounds good to me.<br>  It's best to wear more earthy tones.<br>  Browns, light pinks, bronze in the office.<br>  <br>  People take you more seriously if your face is neutral.<br>  You can be pretty, but not a drop dead bombshell and have men running after you.<br>  Light mascara and eye liner.<br>  <br>  Your regimen already sounds okay for the office.<br>  Sometimes I even do the cat eye and wear black eyeshadow|`|krIKhZzcaa	If you don't have acne or any blemishes, use just a loose powder. Then a brown or charcoal colored eyeliner on the top and bottom of your lid, but make sure its a line. Then use a light pink eye shadow on your upper lid. Then use a light pink lip gloss.<br>  <br>  Make sure its very clean and fresh but still professional.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|qgDCcNQqaa	Use neutral colours like brown, gold, tan/cream, pink etc, and instead of black eyeliner use brown to tone it down a bit and look more natural.<br>  You said your eyelashes are long and thick (jealous :P) so it's optional if you want to use mascara or not but if you choose to then use brown. (:<br>  Hope i helped x|`|rU0MKmZeaa	This sounds fine to me. You went to an interview with that make up on then they obviously have no problem with that make up. By what make up you wear you sound quite young. So there really shouldn't be a problem. After all, your employer employed you for what you can do not how much or how little make you have on.|`|6LJzt2ngaa	maybe wear calmer colors. like the warm colors-browns and pinks. and maybe not so much eye liner|`|4GBQJ4LKaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.The review site is pretty good at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and browse the reviews.|`|BvjPU3wkaa	In an office setting dark eye makeup is kind of an unspoken no-no.  No one will flat out tell you that they don't want you wearing it but it's somewhat understood.  Keep your makeup clean and natural.  Instead of lining your eyes along the bottom, I would suggest a thin line on your upper lid.  You are still drawing attention to your eyes in a much less severe way.  I think making that one small change will make a big difference.
aS81Ckdcaa	dont color your hair right after a perm or relaxing of your hair. Your hair is too damage and the color would just make it beyond repair<br>  wait until your hair is normal and healthy before you color it|`|yl0CZsy2aa	yes, it dries it out.  no matter what the boxes say, it does damage your hair.  makes it feel like straw.|`|eWER4MxSaa	ARE YOU BLACK CAUSE IF YOU ARE, UH dont color your hair that makes ur hair more nappy XD lick my dick <3 liZz|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	I suggest you color your hair THEN perm it
oIkuiP4Paa	Well, a compact most likely won't address all of these problems... But a couple other products should take care of most of them.<br>  <br>  If your skin is dry, you definitely need a good moisturizer. MAC has their moisturelush cream, if you're into that, and just about every drugstore has tons of equally good moisturizers. I suggest Olay's regenerist line or Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with SPF.<br>  <br>  For fine lines, you can rock a concealer, such as MAC's Studio Fix or Studio Sculpt concealer. <br>  <br>  It's best if you apply these in the morning. Moisturize, then concealer. As far as compacts go, I love love love MAC Studio Fix powder foundation. If you moisturize, you shouldn't have any problem with it staying on your skin all day. It will also help control your oily spots. Just make sure you don't use the powder in conjunction with the studio fix fluid. It ends up being WAY too much coverage, and you end up looking cakey. Hope this helps.|`|a5VUy6giaa	dont get a liquid one as <br>  1. use cant get all the liquid out the bottle<br>  2. it wont help your skin and will probably look worse.<br>  <br>  try i compressed mac foundation one thats not oily if you say this to someone at the mac counter they will show you the one i mean because i dont know what its called but that will stay put and it wont dry your skin out because you have quite naturally oily skin and will dry a bit of oil making your skin look healthier!
YseGAHIfaa	Aww, first of all I'd like to say what a nice thing you are willing to do on behalf of others.

They can guide you. Another way you can put your locks to good use is to donate it to a cosmetology school. They can use it for a haircolor class. They use it for swatches to learn the color wheel and the levels of haircolor.|`|p0guNQhiaa	For starters, if you have ever dyed or chemically treated your hair, Locks of Love (and other wig companies) will not accept it. It has to be what they refer to as 'virgin' hair.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if you contact Locks of Love via their website they will very likely tell you salons in your area who will cut your hair and see that it is donate properly if you choose to donate through them.<br>  <br>  Also look around your city. I know of at least one salon in my city where the woman who owns the salon makes the wigs herself (she is my mother's friend and a breast cancer survivor). She then sells these wigs at extremely discounted prices to women and children who need them. Furthermore, she offers FREE haircuts/services to those who come in to donate their hair to her cause.|`|AaoclPYCaa	I know locks of love is a really good charity and make a difference in people's lives.  I don't see the problem with them selling enough hair to offset costs since they have to cover them somehow.  It cost them money to make the wigs.  Its not like they are making a profit or anything just covering costs.
WbQAhDg3aa	Unbelievably he probably just buys clothes he likes. Your taste matches your personality therefore next time you go out look for clothes you like, then you could ask a shop assistant what goes with the item. You could also look online and get ideas from that, are there any celebrities you aspire to be like? Work from there. Good Luck :D

I like men with long hair; I mean; shaggy hair is great too. But I mean down-your-back long hair. You could grow it out some. I don't like guys who wear mall-brands, it's a little to jock-y for me. Black Tee-shirts are fine; but I also think just a plain white button-up looks great on anybody! :) Nice Dark-wash jeans are always in. Most girls like "Emo" boys anymore; (I don't..) But just look at the way the boys from Rock/Emo bands dress, and their hair. A lot of girls like when boys straighten their hair.
ktDZjbH7aa	TAVY,,MY 22YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAD HER BELLY BUTTON,,PIERCED,,,AND SHE SAID IT DIDNT HURT AT ALL,,AND IT LOOKS VERY STYLISH,,,,BUT SHE DID SAY TO MAKE SURE U USE ALACHOL,,OR PROXIDE ON IT FOR AT LEAST 2WEEKS TO MAKE SURE NO INFECTION SETS IN,,,,,PEACE|`|kcD05Xu8aa	i was going to get mine done with my friend, she went ahead but I chickened out! basically they clamp the belly button skin, put a large thick needle through it and like leave you in pain for over a minute. my friend said it was 'soooo painful' but worth it. i have to admit it looks pretty cool. luckily we went to a sterile place but if its unsterile you risk hospitalization. my mums friends a nurse and sed a girl my age (15) came in with a huge swollen belly oozing green puss. nice!<br>  good luck|`|Q0mcr4HSaa	it didnt really hurt. but make sure you use good quality jewelry, because when i had mine done it rejected and now theres a big nasty scar :[ but i had cheap silver ring.|`|N0YH5RRuaa	No!<br>  Don't do it!<br>  Its stupid to pierce any part of your body (except your ears, which is ok).|`|A5wb4vXYaa	I got mine done in around September/October last year (which was a big thing for me because I am petrified of needles...

Bad idea =s<br>  It began rejecting shortly after Christmas and I had to take it out today because it was so close to the surface =(<br>  Word of advice: Yeah get your belly button pierced, it'll look cute, but always clean it, and stick to the same size bar ;)|`|jLOo54oXaa	I got mine pierced when I was 14, and I love it! Some people say it's trashy but I don't care because I think it's cute and guys tend to agree, so do it based on your own taste.

You took the hair from the follicle and you opened it to all kinds of bacteria. I assume you didn't wash it properly before or after. If you put lotion or another oil based soothant, that would probably be the cause. Hope this Helps|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	yes|`|mNh89pN8aa	yes it is totally normal just put some moisturizer on them for the next couple of days and they will be gone
AA10245205	I personally like short hair on both.  My hair is long now, but it used to be very, very short and I'm really leaning towards cutting it all off again.<br>  I HATE long hair on guys, particularly if it's shaggy.  It just looks.... unkept, messy, unclean.  And no matter what anyone says, shaggy hair does not go with a suit - it doesn't belong in the corporate world, etc.  However, I see that you like long hair on guys, so no offense, really.  I liked it back when I was a teenager, but as I got older, it just became more and more unattractive to me.  Tastes change.<br>  You like short hair on girls and that makes me happy :).|`|M8HVkIikaa	I personally think long hair because it looks pretty on most girls..but it depends on the face shape...and ya,, on guys medium. Cause yea.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I think short hair looks good on guys...I personally don't like guys with long hair because it just looks weird to me. <br>  <br>  For girls, I guess long hair is alright...provided that they take care of it.|`|PMuAITczaa	Girls - Longer hair :] Because i think that with some girls they can look like boys if there hair is too short, and you can do more things with long hair!<br>  <br>  Boys - Short, because long har is hippy :L|`|5JbARGHraa	Girls: I think they look better with long layed hair. <br>  It adds more to their look i think.<br>  <br>  Guys: i think medium hair looks cute. Maybe a Fo hock or something.|`|n69ARkLcaa	just depends on what how  the hair is cut but it usually can go good with anything(short, long, medium an any other length|`|n8nX3ogIaa	short hair on girls can look very classy and if the girl has a nice rack and *** then that could look very sexy because i see this one at school i think looks really good with short hair it doesnt really matter what kind of hair she has if she has a sexy body then that disqualifies any thing i could think about her hair and makes her sexy

eow59EaEaa	It's probably due to two reasons:<br>  <br>  1) You have dry, peeling skin in those areas and the makeup is adhering to them making them stand out even more.<br>  <br>  2) You are extremely oily in those places and the makeup is absorbing the oil and you are left with a mixture of oil and foundation pigment that looks like a thick, clumpy mess.<br>  <br>  What you should do: <br>  <br>  1) Always cleanse and moisturize your skin before putting on any makeup. The secret to great looking makeup is properly prepped skin. Even if you are oily, your skin still needs moisture (just use an oil-free moisturizer)<br>  <br>  2) if you are experiencing any dry or peeling skin, make sure your exfoliate two times a week to get all those dry bits off.<br>  <br>  3) Try applying your foundation with a foundation brush for even coverage (using sponges tends to soak up alot of foundation and you have to buy more sooner). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kvaS0MP9aa	Hmm.... I used the same product your using. I found it effective to make sure to wash your face first with a cleanser, then instead of using your fingers to apply the make up, use a fresh make up sponge. Not too much, a little goes a long way. :)|`|g0Ep6LSuaa	naw dont do all those complicated things all you have to do is mix it with mosturizer then your using less to get the same effect and the morsurizer soaks into your skin to make it look more natural no caking i promise :]|`|7aYaOUtiaa	wet the brush before hand, or use mac's studio fix plus. :) [[if in america]]|`|gKuHTs1Caa	try using a foundation brush and put a thin layer on. see if that does the trick..
dfMDTTUAaa	you do eventually stop doing this, it kinda gets old. I know what you mean about the nasty tasting stuff, i used to hate it too. After I got braces I never bit my nails again but personally I find long nails annoying<br>  You could persevere with the stuff and try only painting the very ends of your nails, coloured nail varnish may put you off too or if its really bad, put plasters over all your nails - kind of drastic I know but you will not bite your nails then! Good Luck!|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	see a psychiatrist immediately, post traumatic conditions may be the cause of biting the nails...<br>  or try to put nail polish everyday, that may lessen the times you bite your nails...|`|WPlEOkE5aa	what i did was just ware nail varnish ( black ) so if i bite them it wud luk manky and i wud get black in my teeth. also i tell myself it luks discusting with bitten down nails. but yeh will power is majour|`|FKmdBP45aa	just keep thinking about why you want to stop :DDDD|`|POWGcfjgaa	quickly put a thin layer of nail polish remover on ur nails and wipe in around ur nail and the top of your finger..

jvWAiGSwaa	you can buy nail polish that strengthens your nails and helps them grow. so if you dont bite them or anything like that then it would probly take like six weeks. <br>  <br>  (:|`|fT6x5YChaa	It really depends. If you reguarly do your manicure and apply a base and a top coat, i guess I would not be that long. maybe like 2-3 weeks.|`|5JbARGHraa	If you buy some nail growing polish it could be done in like two weeks.<br>  It also depends on how your body is. Some grow fast and some grow slow.|`|KVCabHoeaa	Yeah I'd say it would take between 2-4 weeks, depending on how fast your nails grow and how well  you take care of them.|`|PpQ9v6F0aa	those are fake.<br>  <br>  for me probably 2 weeks but my nail are weird and they grow super fast.|`|oBulhUEFaa	if you use a nail strengthener it should take no longer than 4 weeks|`|AA10451072	I'm pretty sure those are fake nails.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	for me lets say 1 week i have a strong calcium lvl, i am serious.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I've never seen someone with natural nails that length. Except the weirdos who do snort stuff. I think normal human fingernails are to brittle to withstand every day human activities, unless you sit around doing nothing but I think it would take a little over a year to get them strong enough so they don't break easily.|`|MllcvPXRaa	They're fake. My nails are naturally long shaped, so my nails are usually that long or longer than that. If I cut them as short as I possibly could, they'd take around 2 weeks to get to that length. I suggest biotin supplements for healthy nail and hair growth.|`|ALidyPnXaa	Well, it matters what your nails average growth speed is.<br>  I would say, from fast grow to slow grow it would be about...<br>  2-6 weeks =]<br>  Average: One Month !|`|OuOOy8v3aa	Those aren't real though.<br>  But the average time, if they were cut right back to the finger then they'd take about 4-8 weeks to grow that long.

gKuHTs1Caa	nc50 looked a bit dark for a medium color. i think you were right on for nc45. try each shade on each side of your face. whatever you true shade is, go one shade darker. you don't want to go lighter, you'll have a floating head (when your mkup is too light & doesn't match your neck).<br>  good luck @ the mac counter. i use the mkup,but those girls don't know how to give cust. service. i don't know what it is about them...<br>  hope this helps.|`|R4dLibCnaa	NC45 is lighter than NC50. It shouldn't look darker.<br>  <br>  <br>  You could always pop into MAC anyway and get the girls to put NC45 on half of your face, and NC50 on the other half. You can then decide for yourself which one you think looks better.|`|pgmXNpuOaa	Before I start thanks for the tattoo answer it made me laugh lol.<br>  <br>  anyway I go to cosmetology school and the trick we were taught was even though it might be pricey it works is to mix the colors that best match you if ones too light and ones to dark and there isnt really a color that matches pick those two that are a bit off and mix them!  Its easy and it will give you a nice look....im not familiar with the MAC foundation but i would just mix the NC45 with the 50 one

Apply on the problem area and a little bit around it, then blend it with your foundation. Also, make sure you have plenty of moisturiser as concealers can be drying.<br>  <br>  DO NOT push the brush up and down when you open it. That's the worst thing you could do to dy out mascara because more air gets in the bottle. Hold the bottle in your hands for a bit before you open it to warm it up a little bit. I always use designer mascara, DiorShow is great, Estee Lauder Double Wear is great too, doesn't smudge at all! <br>  <br>  Mascara: use an eye lash comb after you have applied a coat of mascara.<br>  Apply coat by coat and allow dry time in between so the lashes do not clump.<br>  You can zig-zag the brush while you brush up your lashes, but this is hard for beginners!<br>  Use the tip of the mascara brush for corners and bottom lashes.<br>  <br>  Eyelash curlers are a girl's best friend. Heat them up before you use it, but don't burn yourself. <br>  <br>  You can also put vaseline on your lashes before mascara, they keep lashes curled after curling. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope you have found this helpful and I'm sure you will be able to look good for your man! <3|`|1Y073bjiaa	Im not sure for your concealer problem, but get a new mascara that is an anti-clump brush, trust me you can get them. Be sure to buy new mascara every 12 weeks or so, maybe even less. This will help as it won't dry out, also do not pump your mascara as this is letting air get through and there will be less amount of mascara and it will dry out quicker than normal.|`|nzYTVEPwaa	For the concealer, apply a little bit on your problem spots & blend them with a concealer brush or your finger. Do it little by little until you get the desired coverage and so that it doesn't look cakey. For the mascara, don't pump it in and out of the bottle because it can collect air inside the bottle.|`|TgyrzyWTaa	with the mascara apply it on to the top of your eyelashes first and then like normal. wiggle the brush from side to side as you brush it on - it helps to make more go on and just experiment have fun and get your mates round too, make a night of it ;) xx

Zo4TDZD4aa	OK. ive had this problem before! No matter how dry your face gets don't put oil on it especially if your face is already oily. Use an oil free face wash not a scrub, this will inflame your breakouts more try *Neutrogena Oil Free Grapefruit facial cleanser. Then use a toner, this removes the excess dirt and oil. Try *Neutrogena Alcohol Free toner. This will not burn as much as a toner with alcohol on your open acne and dry skin. Then after doing those two steps use a good face cream. Try *Aveeno clear complexion daily moisturizer. I have used them all and they work great, I hope this helps you and if you want to spend  the extra money go for the Aveeno ultra calming night cream to hydrate your skin over night. <br>  <br>  -K

As long as you trust your hairstylist and remember that no matter what, your hair will grow back, it's a lot of fun to just tell them to go for it!<br>  <br>  Also, tell her what you want and she can give you a few ideas.  Ask for suggestions or what she thinks will look good, then have her give you an idea of what it will look like using her hands to show how much will be cut and such.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

Mvu7sFFOaa	Wash your hair with a good shampoo and everything, and then towel dry it for awhile. Then, take a flat brush and blow dry your hair straight by brushing out a chunk of hair and holding the blow dryer on it. When your hair is completely dry, separate your hair into two sections by putting the top into a half pony. You can try straightening spray by herbal essences, its really good and smells the great. Then take pieces of hair, not too big, and straighten it. Go over it a few times, and finish the bottom section. Then let down the top half and do the same.|`|Sr4u5skgaa	You should buy a heat protector spray you can buy them from literally any shop which sells hair products at around about 3 or 4 pound. <br>  Then when you wash your hairr spray on the protector spray before blowdrying it. But not too close to yours roots as i find it can make my hair greasy. Then take your straightners, depending on how thick your hair is section it off in clips to make it easier for you to straighten it. Then take a reasonable size piece of hair and run in through the straightners. You may also want to use hair serum after to stop any frizziness. Hope it works :)|`|fjkukJMFaa	my hair is wavy and i also got a perm so its nice long wavy curls..nothing like a poodle. i recently started using catwalk leave in conditioner (everyone should use leave in conditioner) i also use when i straighten my hair...ion anti-frizz heat protection.. you can get it from sally beauty supple for around 6 bucks and some change. blow dry your hair and all. take sections and spray one section, brush, use flat iron. and repeat for each section. it works well for me!|`|1eMm2YiAaa	Well no matter what hair type you have you def. need a heat protector spray. Tressame makes this product and trust me it is worth it uless you dont care about the damage a straitening iron does to your hair. And when you straiten your hair hair make sure you are going in a root to tip pattern. This will make surethat you have no more wavey spots ( which are plain embaressing. Good Luck!

You could use a spray that protects your hair from heat, but really thats it.|`|Twq7efhQaa	There is a really good site to gettin straight hair and keeping it straight through out the day - <a href="http://www.essortment.com/lifestyle/tipsstraighteni_soth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/lifestyle/tips...</a>|`|kRTSVuywaa	biosilk has a great serum, but be careful as with any, u need to make sure u do not put too much in your hair. It will make ur hair look shiny and it will keep the friz to a minimum. <br>  <br>  But the best thing to do is make sure you are using a porccelin straightener. You can get great ones at sallys for 30-40 dollars!<br>  <br>  I have wavy hair as well and i use a straightener from the porccelin collection!|`|vlCWp7sSaa	You really don't need any sprays or straightening products for your hair after you straighten it.<br>  <br>  I have wavy hair but it doesn't look wavy at all. It looks like a fluff ball. So straighten it is my option if I have time in the morning. I placed the top layer of my hair into a tie and make a mini bun towards the top of my head. I use a 2 inch gold plate straighter. I have it on medium heat. I don't use high because it can fry your hair if you aren't careful. You can use high if your hair tries to fight back.<br>  <br>  I straighten little sections one a time about 2 inches per strand. Then I let loose the top layer and straighten it. After wards I try and find spots I missed by running my fingers through. I put a dab of leave-in-conditioner to push down some of the hair standing up.<br>  <br>  Careful not keep the iron over your hair in a certain spot to long or it can fry it. You shouldn't straighten your hair everyday. It can cause damage to your hair.<br>  <br>  Never straighten your hair when its wet.<br>  <br>  If you're short on time. I scrunch my hair with mousee to get rid of the frizz and give it a curl look!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Addy|`|S5utPIrgaa	1. Wash your hair well with a straightening shampoo and conditioner.<br>  <br>  2. When your hair is partly dry the comb them to get rid of all the knots and then apply a hair straightening gel or mousse into your hair from roots to ends using your fingers.<br>  <br>  3. Towel dry your hair. Divide your hair into small sections and take one a time. Then attach an air concentrator to your blow dryer and make sure your blow dryer's set to medium heat. Cool each strand of hair after blow drying to set in the style. Repeat the process on all sections of hair and your hair is straightened now.|`|2mVpaw4xaa	Who is suitable for the Nanokeratin System?<br>  <br>  The Nanokeratin System straightening method is suitable for all hair types.

Hm0bCjYFaa	there are no guarentees with such dark hair. even that proffessionally done first time.|`|F57mAkXZaa	it's much harder to touch up the roots yourself than to even do the initial color.  if you overlap AT ALL  you will risk breakage.  if you MUST do your roots at home, i suggest you only bleach the top part as far back as you can see. then you will have cut dark underneath and platinum on top and be able to decently maintain it yourself.  <br>  <br>  go to a sally's or other beauty supply shop and purchase powder bleach, 30 or 40 % developer (ask your stylist what they reccomend for your hair type) a squeeze bottle, gloves, and a color applicator brush.<br>  <br>  mix up the bleach and developer (you can buy this as a kit, but do not use the drugstore kind or you will get peach results...use a pro kit)<br>  <br>  you can mix in the squeeze bottle.   make sure it is thouroughly mixed.<br>  <br>  pull the underneath darker part into a ponytail.<br>  <br>  part the top of your hair and squeeze out a line of bleach onto the roots.  spread it over the uncolored hair with the brush.  be very careful not to get bleach onto the already colored part.  use the back of the brush(the long skinny part) to part a thin section next to the first.  coat both sides with bleach according to above instructions.  repeat untill you get to the end, then go back to the center and work the other way.  go quickly but carefully.  touch up extra around your hairline and ears as these are tough places.  after about 15 minutes check through and put more bleach on the spots that aren't lifting as quickly.  you should'nt need more than 45 minutes for the bleach to develop,  but keep tugging on a small section of hair to make sure it is not breaking.  you can rub some of the bleach off to make sure it has lifted enough, then shampoo and condition.<br>  <br>  for shampoos to tone and avoid that baby chick color you can use "shimmer lights"  or i believe manic panic makes a platinum toning shampoo.  or you can use a toner like special effects or manic panic virgin snow.<br>  <br>  using a purple based shampoo will eliminate that brassy yellow tone and make it nice and white and pretty.<br>  <br>  in my experience redkin extreme is the best conditioner.  it is pricey, but it will save your hair.  if you can only afford one product from that line get the anti-snap which is a leave in and works miracles.  <br>  <br>  also with platinum hair you will want to try to wash as little as possible. maybe one to two times a week if you can stand it.  and make sure you blowdry with a wide paddle brush to smooth the cuticles down. airdrying will make you look fuzzy.  another great trick is to rinse your conditioner out with cold water.  that will seal the cuticles and make it shiny.<br>  <br>  if you absolutely must do your whole head platinum and can't stand the idea of a darker underneath, then find a friend who is good with a paintbrush and teach them the method to touch up roots...you will risk more breakage this way, but better than trying to do the back of your head yourself.<br>  <br>  i have had platinum hair and many bright colors requiring bleach for many years and have fried my hair totally off my head.  this is the absolute best way that i have been able to have great looking hair without the salon price.<br>  <br>  good luck!!!!|`|QXYuWOvraa	Hmm. The previous poster is right... no guarantees for going dark to platinum.<br>  Most good professionals will reccommend going lighter in stages, the same for going back darker. Look at Jessica simpson for example. After she went dark she had to get lighter in stages so as not to completely fry the hair...<br>  I use the generic bleach kit from sally's when I did my sisters hair for 3 years :) It works.<br>  As for helping damaged hair... I have been using Dove Intense Therapy  shampoo AND conditioner...<br>  I love it! Absolutely! Its awesome :) I dont even heat style my hair anymore for everyday stuff-- just let it dry naturally. It doesn't look all dry scraggly and gross anymore :)<br>  ive tried rusk, matrix, and organix lines for dry and damaged hair-- was not impressed<br>  good luck :)|`|xPoenaMpaa	Dont know lot bout that type of hair colors...for damaged hair...gotta try different kinds of shampoo until you find the right one for you thats what i did,also, try a shampoo and conditioner thats salt-free: i went to salon, got my hair done and asked them i think it'll work good. :P|`|9eFWmprEaa	first things first you need to deep condition for at least a month.I would suggest to heavily hilite your hair so that you wouldnot have to color so often.

I was raised in the southeast Texas/west Louisiana area, and being so close to the Gulf of Mexico made it so humid, windy, and rainy all the time! Now I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and it's SO much better. It rains once in a while, but it's far enough from any major body of water that it doesn't get very windy or humid. In fact, it's never humid out here, which was the thing I hated most back home. The heat here is dry heat, and it's so much better.<br>  <br>  So just judging from my experiences, I would say north Texas or Oklahoma. Any of the coastal areas will be far too windy and humid (no matter how far away from the ocean you think you are) and any of the midwestern states will be so dry you'll have to start worrying about your skin too!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and good luck!|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	I live in Florida, a lot of humidity. <br>  <br>  The best climate that is hot and sunny with no humidity is Arizona!

79Eep5Pdaa	it's a needle punching a hole in your skin, of course you're going to feel it but it all depends on your ability to take pain. i've had mine pierced once before and i've found that it's a pointless piercing. <br>  <br>  <br>  it doesn't matter if you get it pierced with a stud, or a hoop it's still going to push it's way out of your ear in the end.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|OuOOy8v3aa	Yes, they hurt but the actual piercing isn't unbearable.<br>  It's mainly the after care that hurts the most.|`|xsz3bJnHaa	I'm not going to sit here and say it doesnt hurt because it does. It actually hurts a lot. When I got mine done I heard it pop and it did bleed. It was very painful to me. If i ever take my piercing out I wont get it done again. I want my left side pierced but no thanks lol too much pain.|`|4Zrr8DUwaa	piercings hurt! But the amount of pain will vary from person to person. Mine did not hurt that bad at all though. I have my bellybutton to and i think that hurt more but i didn't think that was anything to bad. If you count to 5 its over done and then the pain even if you have a low tolerance of pain its done. Its really NO big deal at all if you want it done get it. oh but after its done make sure you clean it often or it will get infected and it will hurt then real bad but the actual piercing itself its a breeze good luck.|`|eTBfsjCUaa	I got mine done a few years ago and I LOVE it. A lot of people don't have them bc they are scared to get them done.<br>  It didn't really hurt too bad when they did it but it was sore for a while. Be very careful with it and be sure to follow directions on how to take care of it....my friends got infected and it was a huge mess.|`|TWAmyQ6paa	I'd imagin, just like every other piercing.  How well you can take pain will determine how much it hurts.|`|6LJzt2ngaa	any and every piercing hurts. of course. the question is if your tolerance is eenoughto handle it.|`|svWNEewdaa	I have my right tragus pierced. And in all honestly I went in there scared to death that it was going to hurt. It happened so fast you couldn't even feel pain, it creeped me out a bit because you could hear somewhat of a "pop" noise, but that's because the tragus is a thick piece of skin, but because I was so scared I almost passed out, I psyched myself out! ANyways you have to take REALLLLLY good care of it. A good amount of people I know got it and treated it like a regular ear piercing and all of theirs got infected with a bump on it.. also if ya get it done beware of brushes and combs and hair cuts (can get snagged a lot) but it looks awesome so I would in courage you to do it! Just take very good care of it :)|`|DlUqgUA0aa	Ive had mine done for about 2 years now....   the peircing its self doesnt hurt.  you hear a loud "POP" when it goes through but it doesnt hurt.  Make sure u keep it clean, bactine works great.  it doesnt sting either.   I was in nursing school when i got mine done, the stethescope on the new piercing doesnt work out well. (OUCH)  other than that, i love mine    its too cute!   Go ahead and get it... you'll be fine.  My little cousin was 11 and got hers done!|`|UbFGfzehaa	what is a tragus piercing????

It is lightweight, stays on all day, absorbs excess oil, and even soothes any irritation you might have on your face. I find that it goes on really easy and is very easy to blend. I bought it at CVS for $7, but you can buy it at any drug store for the same price.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	revlon colorstay foundation and prescriptive foundation. they last the whole day.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	there's this red L'oreal foundation; that's a 16 hour one and it does stay on for long. it has a nice smell on too lol :) i used this, from going from this cheap stuff and i think it really made a difference to my skin, but it's a liquid foundation :) you could always buy some boujours powder; or some other powder to go out with it too :) it's about ￡13.99 or something from superdrug/boots. there are lots of good ones about; just try some different ones to see which works best and which one suits you the most :) <br>  <br>  i use dream matte mousse at the minute; but not always the best product to use because it makes some people orange; and some people have fairly dry skin. i think it works ok for me to be honest :) it's about ￡5 from superdrug/boots/the market :)|`|6gYK8tzoaa	You cant beat Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish. A bit expensive at ￡16.50 from Debenhams but well Worth it.|`|GM3zog4Jaa	I would recommend Revlon Colorstay.|`|rjsB4oDkaa	almay smart shade makeup !!|`|nidCgr73aa	Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse foundation, not for dry skin though. I have combination/normal skin so it's fine for me. <br>  <br>  Lasts all day and I really notice it because I don't use foundation during the week, I replace if with tinted moisturiser and it always comes off with Dream Matte Mousse it doesn't.<br>  <br>  I comes in ranges of colours and has concealers to match if you need one. Remember if you get a concealer it's one shade lighter than your foundation, okay?<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|vpmT5p8Saa	the two best wearing foundations on the market are estee lauder's doublewear (full coverage) and diorskin forever(med coverage) the dior also has spf 25 and is water resistant! both retail for around ￡25 or i think about $40 in the US and are available from larger department store, and have a really good colour range to choose from!|`|gqZal7NPaa	I use a 2true foundation works really well for me only about ￡5-￡10<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|TCEMPM4maa	L'oreal true match very good!

It's long lasting, oil-free and contains SPF 17. It also stay relatively matte all day. It's in the $30 dollar range but worth every penny. I have a couple of other foundations I use depending if I am feeling oily or dry but I receive compliments on how my skin looks whenever  I wear the Shiseido.<br>  <br>  If you want a REALLY matte finish (I mean matte!) try Merle Norman Luxiva Lasting Foundation. It's in the $25 dollar range but it's also waterproof! The best I have found for super oily skin.<br>  <br>  Also if you apply with a foundation brush, you will get a much more even coverage.|`|1Y073bjiaa	Dream matte mousse gives brilliant coverage, despite me not even wearing foundation i know these things.<br>  No7 and other well known brands are also good.<br>  If you have olive skin or darker skin, yellow based foundations are for you,<br>  if you want to test your color when picking a new type, put 3 colors on your jawline and walk outside into the light, so you can actually see if it blends well.|`|lvnjmoJMaa	l'Oreal Infallible foundation stays on for 16 hours, and doesn't go on all streaky.

zhzJoZ26aa	Get a red lipstick with a brown undertone. I'm not sure which one has a brown undertone (because I get mine with a coral undertone), but there are many out there. Go to a makeup counter and ask for a red lippy, with a brown undertone. If I'm not mistaken MAC Russian red has brown/coraly tone. But don't take me up on that  because I haven't tried that lipstick.|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	redish orange.|`|BO28Mn8haa	fancy and amy winehouse are oxymorons.|`|3173ab6a389f5c3f0702c8fdf1a06537aa	An orange-based red would look nice on you!

622ab836027ae3f0786ef2f05e960354aa	try aloe vera plant.  cut a portion of the leave and use the transparent "gel" as lotion on clean face, let it dry then wash off, repeat for a few days.  Look up use of aloe vera and you may be surprised what this plant can do for skin, it's anti-inflammatory, soothes burns, promotes healing, to name a few of it's uses, and my new personal favorite - it reduces the appearances of dark spots (face of course) and it's free (well, except you need to buy a plant)!

Go for something fancy. Browse through some haircuts, pick some and go to a stylist. It will give you a whole different look. You may also want to change your hair color. Another thing you can do is to put the accent to your eyes, and your lips to remain subtle. Add some blush to your cheeks and you're done :)<br>  BTW, don't know about your clothes, but you may want to change the black switcher with something fancier :) Try to stay fresh.|`|M3pufPlnaa	your a little vain thou don't ya think? <br>  your pretty,  (now dont take this in a offencive way) <br>  but this is just for you to get loads of comments about you! nothing we can actually give good answers to, to get Best Answer... <br>  just please don't post this again? <br>  but your pretty :)<br>  :)|`|xn7amAYVaa	i think your very pretty!!<br>  dont listen to people that tell you,you need to lose weight because to tell you the truth your not fat!!<br>  and i think you have the shyness about you that is great!!|`|O3emPK8saa	Your honestly very beautiful and I myself would love to have a girl like you.

EZ5mwUF3aa	Try Coppertone Endless Tan, it's very light and deepens with every application. I use it every day mixed with my perfume lotion.

Put some on a cotton pad/ball and hold it on the spot for about a minute, this will disinfect it and also stop the bacteria from spreading and causing other spots on your face when you moisturise. You can also dab pure tea tree oil on it (you can buy it in superdrug for about 4 pounds for a little bottle).

AA11525743	It's probably fine. Usually night creams are just thicker and more inconvenient to use during the day, but if your skin is really dry, it will certainly do the trick!|`|zXHNSohTaa	It won't kill you or anything, but night creams tend to be richer and more emollient, so they are often too greasy for under make up. Also, some creams or treatments are more optimally absorbed while you are asleep and skin is regenerating. But if it doesn't fit into your night routine and you don't mind how thick it is, go ahead and where it whenever you like.|`|BoYISPf3aa	They obviously didn't make it for the day if it is night cream... <br>  But read the box or container it comes in and see what it says...

(not curling or straightening) (this breaks the ends and splits them and then it doesnt grow) and once a week deep condintion it. i like aussie deep conditioner. you should tell your mom about your obession. im not trying to scare you but it could be a mental condition. it happens. she may be able to help and get you stuff to help it. but it you have a mental disorder and fix these youll just keep finding more things that are wrong this is why you should talk to your mom. remember when you see other girls they are insucrities to some just cover them up with something else. like bullies. just be yourself and love yourself. i know its easier to say then do. i feel close to the way you are. and im 21. its a part of life unfortuantly. good luck sweetie.

My friend had a huge amount of bruising on her most recent tattoo and none on the one before that. It should fade in a few days!<br>  <br>  (I'm just assuming it's bruising based on your question - is there yellow ink in your tattoo that could have migrated?)|`|g5yPhBzVaa	I too have quite a few and I bruise easy, so it was normal for me to have them turn yellow.

NudkN1eIaa	Bra's are not categorized like women's apparel (Juniors, Misses, Plus, etc.)  However you do have your training bras for those who are just starting out.  From experience, I do know that the size heavily depends on the brand of bra.  A lot of cute novelty bras run a lot smaller than your basic functional bra (such as a Platex or a Fruit of the Loom, or Cacique).  The best way to figure out what size you actually wear is to go some department stores and try them on to see what works for you.  Stores like Victoria Secret, Dillards, and Sears have professional bra fitters that will size you free of charge.  As far as the pricing goes, a good bra for your chest size may run between 15.00-20.00 depending on where you shop.  You can find a lot of good quality bras on-line, it just takes a little shopping around.  I am 23 years old and I wear a 40 G-H and I have paid as much as 30.00 for a GOOD bra, but I have also paid a low a 9.99 in Dillards / Lane Bryant.|`|0wCShkEKaa	Hey... u have lot of confusions in ur mind na??<br>  dont worry.... im also 17 n i use 30A size...actually the only thing matters is cup size than bra size... u go for the size i suggested... or.. u can do one more thing.. ask for some sport slips... it contains elastic n it will be comfortable for u...|`|QV4nhS6xaa	I Would of thought  they're the same size , why would they wanna go confusing people by changing the size when you become an adult ?|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	I think the teen ones are made differently because typically teens are smaller all around than women.  I would stick to regular sizes, 32A, 34A sizes like that. and 17$ isn't a lot at all.

Yh my mom thinks the same thing...just need like 3-5 bras n bras last a long time if tooken care of properly.|`|ik3ra3Dpaa	Teen sizes are somewhat different. Meaning Women and Teens have different back sizes and theyre bust is a little bigger than a teen. But everyone developes different and you nearer to a woman than a teen now, maybe they have grown and you just havent noticed because you have been wearing smaller bras all this time. i understand what you mean, im also seventeen and im wearing a 36A. In womens to be exact. To me its a lot more comfertable to me and easier for me to move around in without them falling out. but when i wear a Teen Bra my stuff falls out and it seems like they stay too far apart or something.

There is that initial pinch but then it just turns warm and the dull pain goes away. I've had 14 piercings total and my ear lobes were the least painful.|`|AA11399475	DON'T go to a place like Claires/Icings/Walmart etc(any other place that uses guns). A piercing gun should NEVER be used on ANY piercing. They're gross. Not to mention they have risk of infection. Those people at Walmart/Mall/Etc aren't trained, ANYBODY can use a peircing gun. Not to mention the fact that they reuse the guns OVER AND OVER again, that's unsanitary. Yeah, they TRY to wash the guns over but seriously, that's effing gross. Not to mention it's basically stabbing the earring through the ear!<br>  <br>  <br>  As for pain, seriously, it is NOT a big deal. It depends on your pain tolerance thou. I have multiple ear piercings and all of them were just a lil pinch for me.|`|mNh89pN8aa	No not that i know of!<br>  <br>  but it doesnt hurt well it hurts for like 2 seconds and then it is over....i got my ears pierced when i was 6 but i play soccer which i have to take them out for and so the holes closed up so i got them pierced again and then the closed up again and so i got them again and it didn't hurt at all.<br>  <br>  also you could take a couple Advil before getting the pierced!|`|a4Z2J9Eraa	ohmagawsh NO! Not at all!! It's just like getting a shot in your arm. it's over in a blink of an eye. Trust me you don't need to numb your ear, it's not really worth it... at all!|`|9QdtQczYaa	noooo its fine i got both my ears pierced when i was 5 and my belly button pierced when i was 13 and that f***ing hurt like hell!!! im a girl btw!! lol! get it done its not bad at all.... promise XD|`|MCpCOgaHaa	Well.. I have a suggestion.. I don't know if you have heard or seen like a " roll-on stick" or something usually used before eyebrow twitching (found in pharmacies). All you have to do is roll it below and above eyebrows and its supposed to numb it for a couple of minutes so the twitching wont hurt.. so basically its purpose is to numb, so you might want to try that before piercing (hey if it numbs it try it so it wont hurt) good luck..|`|47SA9Y2Paa	haha na don worry you wont even feel it ima girl an i got my ears pierced at a young age but im thinking youll feel the gun go thru but it doesnt hurt but be sure to clean your ears once you get them pierced so that way you wont have no problems btw itll go really fast you wont even realize your finised it takes like 2 seconds hope that helped!!|`|YJ3pPYCOaa	umm wow, dude, get over it. a lot of things hurt worse. i've had my ears pierced three times, its not that bad!! it hurts for like three seconds then it gets red but thats it. seriously.... its not that bad.|`|mQVqfbRMaa	dont be scared and when you get it pierced tell them not to tell you when its gonna hurt and trust me it doenst hurt it just feels a lil hot.....|`|NR7SHdMgaa	ear is not painful at all. but u could numb it with ice maybe.
P1r3knqjaa	Yes cartilage piercings will be red and continue to hurt for up to 3 months after you receive the piercing. Redness and itching is normal, if you see clear pus, ur still ok. But if it's cloudy or white in color, soak in sea salt solution 3-4 times a day. Also if your piercing is ok as of now and just a little red and irritated, don't be so vigorous with the cleaning it. Just wash it in the morning and before you go to bed, cleaning it as often as you are is prolly what making it worse. Clean it twice a day only make an exception if you have a strenuous/ vigorous work out and you've perspired ( sweated) alot. Hope this Helps!|`|YOUARfrfaa	Yes, that is normal. My cartilage piercing was sore for about a month without an infection. Just make sure you use the cleaning solution thouroughly.|`|VAqD392Baa	To start with yes it will be irratiable because claire pierced it with a gun not a needle which pushes the cartlidge which is why you will have  a lump xx

cuNdAE3Daa	well....the only way to look exactly like her is if you have airbrushing and professional stylists and makeup artists following you around every where. she might be really pretty in real life as well but not perfect just try and go for more red colours in your clothes and if you want then copy her but don't take her style completely as it might not suit your personality. With makeup go for natural shades and a hint of eyeliner but don't go crazy.<br>  hope this helps you<br>  xx mwah|`|vRZolfOraa	Ahh --- Blair Waldorf the character from the Gossip Girl series (played by Leighton Meester)!<br>  <br>  She has a very high class, couture sense of style which many people aspire to and envy! But you need to remember that she is a character in a TV programme and no one ever looks that perfect or is that immaculately dressed without an unlimited supply of money and a the team of stylists that work with Leighton on the show.<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking pieces of her style to suit you, for example try feminising your everday wardrobe, wear a few more skirts and dresses than usual -- I have never seen an episode of Gossip Girl where Blair wore jeans! Take snippets of her accessorizing genius, for example to beautiful hairbands she wears.

FplTPoAyaa	Most hair gels will leave a "wet look".  Try Suave Spray Hair Gel, or Tresemme.|`|Dm8s3bBLaa	Rather than using a hair gel, why don't you try a spray wax?  I use Paul Mitchell spray wax when I don't want a wet look, but I want to be able to style my hair.  It's not the least expensive product, but a little bit of wax goes a long way so you can keep one bottle for a while.  Be careful to only use enough to style your hair to avoid looking like you have too much product in your hair.

As far as the love things goes if you got a gal that's using make up to land love which I don't think there's anything wrong with then its really a matter of what you prefer in a girl versus what she like.

I rather have on no make-up at all, the most i'll do is eyeshadow.<br>  <br>  But someones appearance should not determine if u like them or not.<br>  Most girls dnt realize that if a dude likes u that its more than just your outward appearance.|`|xQPP01tVaa	Some girls just arent secure enough about there looks. they want perfection, so they use as much make up as they see neccasary to make themselves perfect. and some girls actually need makeup. Just not that much.|`|2pNUIJ5Jaa	they think they are not pretty enough and will see a pretty girl wearing makeup and think that if they put it on they will look like that|`|nUU9U9Asaa	I don't think that.<br>  I only wear makeup on special occasions.<br>  I don't want it to cover my beauty, like it does with everyone else.|`|05b98df23c57976babc69aaad9a64c1caa	girls like to try hard for blokes but sometimes too hard!|`|UDmOcE5Zaa	i guess some guys like that sorta thing
BLnXhWoTaa	wait.  i just read an answer from you where you said you like socks with sandals.  what terrible fashion sense are you talking about?<br>  <br>  socks with sandals wearers, unite!!!!1|`|kc6XVl2Iaa	ahaha, yahoo probably read hippie and put it in cultures and social groups and stuff. <br>  But its totally fine to just give in, if it makes you happy. don't ever try to be someone your not, your clothes should represent who you are. And you should be comfortable in your clothes. its not bad taste to be comfortable.|`|SEPoeFm2aa	Is not your fault if ypu have bad taste in clouths.My opinion is to ask the help of a friend or girlfriend and to go shopping with him / her.If  then not make it any time if you have money try a stylist, this advice is only in an emergency and if you have money.If you haven't got money  then I say you don't try if you do not have anything to lose. Sorry about my english..I hope you will understand.|`|Jh235bFtaa	Honestly, fashion is so ridiculous nowadays that pretty much anything can be claimed to be "fashionable", so don't worry about it. Just wear wht you want!|`|c7ERXsGSaa	Well babe, you'll never marry a gay man dressin like that!<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't worry about it!|`|hj6XcV3Taa	Hey,<br>  <br>   Well at the end of the day there is nothing wrong with 'weired' clothes and it's good to be a bit original and stand out from the crowd. You have to ask yourself - Who am I trying to impress ? <br>   Why should you care about what random people in the street think of you, it's not like you're ever going to see them again. If you feel confident in what you wear then you're bound to be happier and more comfortable. I admire you for being original and not worrying if random - dare I say it idiots who obviously have nothing better to do, who think youre 'weired'. So I say stop trying to be something you're not and just be happy, life's to short !! <br>   I may suggest an investment in a nice pair of jeans though. <br>  <br>  Hope this has helped :)|`|q0Dg8a1haa	If that's what you like, then you are perfect just the way you dress.|`|QE77Oxtqaa	Well, I wear whatever I feel like wearing when I fall out of bed in the morning. My favorite blouse right now is a gossamer red thing with bell sleeves that I wear with an under bust corset. Too bad I put it on just to got to the grocery store...

ggTRs3Paaa	mane & tail shampoo! i bought it at sally beauty supply and it made my hair grow faster and healthier :)|`|4w361g8Laa	There is no shampoo that will help your hair grow faster. I've heard prenatal vitamins work but only from women who are already pregnant. The rate at which hair typically grows is an average of 1/2 inch per month. Some people's hair grow faster or slower than that but really, its all determined in your genes or DNA. So unless you are planning on altering your DNA then you can't. Also hair growth begins under the scalp in your hair follicle...so how can putting shampoo on top of your scalp and on already grown hair, make it grow faster?<br>  There are things that you can do, though, to ensure your hair stays healthy as you grow it, which is important. Get regular trims every 6 weeks, eat healthy...lots of veggies, protiens etc, drink water. Don't over process your hair with chemicals (colors, perms etc), keep heat styling to a minimum or be sure you are using the correct products like heat protectants.<br>  <br>  PS You will find lots of shampoos and conditioners in grocery stores and drugstores that claim to make hair grow faster but you'll never find any in a professional salon line...makes you think. If it really worked, then a professional salon shampoo line would have one because it would make TONS of money ;)|`|oZCe2CiHaa	If you suffer from hair loss, NIOXION shampoo and products are great.<br>  If you have cut it and desire it to grow out long again more quickly, there are safe vitamins.<br>  I used Biotin, over the counter vitamin, from GNC.  Use it AS DIRECTED on the bottle.  They told me I could take 3, three times a day,of the mg I purchased.  I had a reaction that caused a lot of problems with my body digesting the high dosage.  The bottle had only suggested 3 per day.<br>  Biotics and Natures Plus also have a great line.<br>  Protein vitamins and washes as well as Pre Natal vitamins work well, however many people experience increased appetite with the vitamins.<br>  Ask at GNC or a similar place.|`|XIIGr5f2aa	ganier fructics length and strengh line helps hair grow faster, especially if you straighten your hair. get lots of trims, like once every 2 months. i am currently in the process of growing out my hair, so i feel your pain! try to limit straightening or curling it, this makes more split ends, making it harder to grow your hair. try to find some cremes or gels to make your hair natural. good luck!|`|1TradJBIaa	pantene has a "beautiful lengths" line. I've been using it and my hair has grown, idk if it's because of the shampoo. But it smells good.. and it's supposed to help you grow your hair longer.|`|YGbz1V8naa	No, there is no way to make your hair grow faster. Hair grows, on average, 1/2 an inch per month.|`|X34aUxp0aa	growthspurt works, its not a shampoo though.  You put it on your scalp.  You can get it at yourgoodhair.com|`|IowG78BGaa	shampoo or extensions|`|3386a9bcd9ef3875a451c04733f1e32baa	Use Sulfur 8 Oil!!|`|p3GZERIsaa	nope.

It works so well....It help grow some of my hair in and it was pretty fast..but don't get me wrong, nothing gives you hair over night..I still have damage from my hair-loss..you just need to eat lots of protein and regain a healthy life style with exercise and keep stress away! :)<br>  <br>  ?|`|AA10458195	It more what you eat than what you put on your hair that will help it to<br>  grow.  The hair that you are putting something on to make it grow is already grown hair. Lots of protein will help you grow healthy hair. Also<br>  My Dr recommended Black Current or Evening Primrose oil to help <br>  aid in hair growth. I had surgery and some medication I was on made<br>  my hair fall out. I take the EPO.

nHWmDirFaa	If you feel like reading a book, I'd suggest 'Survive!' by Les 'Survivorman' Stroud. He's also got his own tv show that airs everynight at 8pm on OLN (Outdoor Life Network) [It might just be a Canadian show] But really any book store has lots of books on survival, and they also tell you what to bring on hiking or canoa trips.<br>  <br>  If your 14 and it's with school, I'm sure they will supply most of the stuff. IF YOUR ALLOWED to bring them, knives, water proof matches, raincoats are always good. Sunscreen, a hat, Khaki pants or shorts (with lots of pockets).<br>  <br>  The only thing for the hair that I can think of is a do-rag.|`|uA0xorILaa	being a kayaker myself, pack a good lunch, but find a waterproof bag to put it in, sunscreen just incase, a towel,<br>  <br>  as far as your hair, keep a hat on and if it is sunny sunglasses, they help alot

You should post a current photo of yourself so we can give the right opinion.<br>  <br>  Also another thing to consider, dying your hair dark when you have blond highlights in the summer time can be a waste of money.

You make a ponytail pull it through and then use kurbie grips to make the bun. Or you could make a fish plait and then pull random bits of hair out for a cute messy boho look.|`|xgziZhNOaa	My friend pulls her hair into a pony tail, then bunches it up and lets it down slightly either side. It looks messy but gorgeous|`|AILK0BTiaa	you can go on youtube.. they have a ton of instructional videos.. :o)|`|xQPP01tVaa	u light it on fire.|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Spritz hair with enough water to make the hair pliable, but not soaking it. <br>  Apply the gel of your choice through your hair. To get the "slick" look, use a gel marketed to athletes (such as Dep). This type of gel usually helps fight humidity and calms the frizzies, especially in curly hair. <br>  Secure your hair in a ponytail using a ponytail holder. Position the ponytail about where you want the bun to lay. If you are going for an elegant look, set the ponytail lower down. For a dance performance or work around the house, set it a bit higher. <br>  Twist the tail either in two sections or one (For people who have longer, thicker hair may want to seperate the tail into 2 peices). Guide the twist into a coil around the ponytail holder. For people with longer, thicker hair, bobby-pin the coil into place as you wind it around and around the ponytail holder. People with shorter, thinner hair can often get away with winding and twisting the coil first and then inserting bobby pins about 45 degrees apart from each other (think of your bun as a circle). <br>  Make sure to secure the end of the ponytail to the bun with a bobby pin. <br>  To continue with that sleek, pulled back look, you may opt to wrap a hairnet that matches your hair around the bun. This will keep any stray hairs in place and is especially crucial if you are putting your hair in a bun to go exercising (so it will not fall out of place). Secure the hairnet with more bobby pins. <br>  Spritz the entire hair style with hairspray.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsThere are many variations on this hairstyle. Try parting your hair in the middle or on the side before tying it back into the ponytail. Leave a few strands out for the romantic look. Adjust the level of the ponytail (low, mid-head, or on the crown of your head). Experiment with falls, fancy hair clips, or fun barrettes. Try braiding the tail before you wind it around into a bun. For a cute sloppy bun, tie hair back in a pony tail. then turn hair around secured pony. After that, secure the twisted pony tail with elastic band. Pull small pieces of hair out of the sloppy bun, to make it less "ballerina" like. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] WarningsAlways inspect your supply of bobby pins and never use pins that are missing the protective caps on the end. Damaged bobby pins will scratch your scalp and tear your hair. <br>  Avoid wearing this hairstyle (or any other hairstyle) daily to minimize hair breakage. <br>  Never use a regular elastic band to secure your hair. These are not meant to secure hair, and will pull/break your hair. Only use ponytail holders meant for that purpose. <br>  Don't use too much gel as it can build up in hair. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Things You'll NeedHair gel (optional) <br>  Hairspray <br>  1 or 2 Ponytail holders <br>  Bobby pins <br>  Hairnet that matches your hair color (optional) <br>  Brush or comb
MSI5s64faa	the main difference is that human hair extensions can be treated just like your natural hair in most ways.  It can be tinted, hilighted, toned to match your color perfectly, cut, curled, flat-ironed, etc...<br>  <br>  With Synthetic extensions you can not use any heat tools. It would burn the hair.  You also can not color or hilight the hair.  Also, you have to even be careful washing and drying the hair.<br>  <br>  The best bet is to go with Natural extensions, but if you do use the synthetic, I would use it for a special event where you dont plan on keeping it in for long. Synthetic becomes rattier and "nappy" looking faster than human hair pieces. But I have seen synthetic pieces that look very real and nice.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|mqlzkJ54aa	Synthetic is fake and natural is real.. yes you can tell the differnece..|`|cN7XNrxOaa	if colour then you will (and mostly get away with it) but if it a few shades dark or lighter then it noticeable|`|IkMkmEiraa	i have synthetic hair extensions (Jessica Simpson ones) and i wear them to school.<br>  people say it looks more realistic than my friends and hers are real hair<br>  it also might depend on if you put them in properly<br>  <br>  Also<br>  dont straighten or curl them on a high heat <br>  or theyll melt<br>  but, mine dont melt on about 200F

Most people say it doesn't even hurt.<br>  <br>  Not me though - mine hurt a lot. I'm a wuss. I cried, lol, like a little girl. But I definitely didn't jump and ruin it. The pain isn't the kind of pain to make you jump; it's more of a dull pain.<br>  <br>  And if it really looks like it hurts, the tattoo artist may ask if you need a break. However you skin becomes slightly desensitized to the pain the longer the tattoo goes on, so if you take a break when it starts back up it'll just hurt again. So with that logic I told the guy not to stop and just sat there & dealt with it.

Really if you psych yourself out to much you probably will jump so just take a few big deep breaths and you will be fine. As strange as it sounds think of someone taking a needle and just poking you with it 100 times a second. After a few seconds the area goes pretty numb and its much easier to bear. <br>  <br>  Many people recommend to look away but I think that is a bad Idea. I think if you look at it while its being done you will see whats going on and know what to expect from there. You will know when he is going to put the needle on you and know when the pain is going to come so you wont flinch. The most you will do is just tense up and if you go to a legitimate tattoo parlor they are trained at how to keep drawing while you are tensing up.|`|BGnMVMJJaa	you won't jump - I have many and yes they hurt but it's bearable and even if you did jump just a little it'd be one prick you jumped at and it might hurt a bit more but it won't ruin a whole tattoo - and FYI I vote stomach, unless you plan to have 10 kids :)   I don't dig the tramp stamps either.|`|3ff7fbbf6ec3ee979b59d7290a91816daa	You will do just fine.  Don't go psyching yourself up before then because you will just be thinking about what you may have heard others talk about when they got tattoos.  It's different for everyone, and for the most part, it doesn't hurt like you may have heard!  Just make sure your tatt artist isn't drinking any alcoholic beverages or inebriated at the time you get inked!  Be calm, cool and collective and it will be over before you know it; enjoy your tattoo!|`|8lYchdB9aa	Even though it seems like a valid fear right now, once you get there and the artist is working on you you'll realize you won't and even if you do jump most likely it won't mess it up.  Most artists are ready for people to move, sneeze, jump or even pass out.  It's not that big of a deal.|`|kVTbEb1Paa	Two things, it does hurt, BUT you probably won't jump. Try applying 5 pounds of pressure to your arm with a fingernail and dragging it along your skin. That's about what it will feel like. It will feel REALLY weird along bones though, and you will probably shiver, but artists are very experienced, and will expect that. Just tell them its your first.|`|vuxef3O4aa	I say Do it. But sure it the one you want to for 20 to 30 years from now.<br>  It will hurt, depending how sensitive your skin is. but the longer it the less the pain, you body adapt to the pain by building up adrophine's.<br>  by the end it's done you will fell supper|`|ydKGJ7Nnaa	Don't worry about that.  They strap you down to the chair before they start so you cant leave. . . . <br>  <br>  he he (just kidding)<br>  <br>  It really doesn't hurt that bad.  Its like a cat scratch . . you will get used to it within the first 30 seconds.<br>  <br>  Hope it turns out great!|`|Xc8dd6t4aa	Don't get a tramp stamp- you will regret it.  Bring someone with to talk to and to distract you.  I wouldn't worry about "jumping" while they are doing it.|`|nmC7qgtZaa	Who are all these muppets saying think about when you 80 when your 80 you'll probly be ugly as hell anyway and all wrinkley an old tattoo will be the least of your worrys, my goodness people are stupid|`|UxrIFKyxaa	Relax. It doesnt hurt. try avoiding the thought a needle is going in and out of your flesh!|`|kBBFbTPiaa	dont cuz think to the futer when you are 80 of summikn you will so regret it!! so dont!!|`|bIhyeMJVaa	do you have tourette's syndrome or something?|`|AA10766729	Just remember to breathe!  If you think it's going to hurt, it's more likely to, so just don't think about it.  It's not that bad really.  And if you jump it won't ruin the entire thing; they inject so little ink at a time it's not like you're going to have a huge black line running up your back or something!  <br>  <br>  You'll be fine.  MILLIONS of people have them...and most of them even look ok!|`|l3L5eYj4aa	Don't do it. Don't disrespect your body!|`|04a31323aa0674874fbc03558306d39eaa	you wont jump, its bearable (and I have a very low pain threshold)|`|p73oMCV8aa	You won't jump but it will hurt|`|3Anex7vxaa	Umm...so what's the question?
oiQTd3Hpaa	I'm not sure I understand your question, so I don't know if i'm going to answer it correctly. I've heard cocoa butter helps prevent stretch marks, so I'm sure it will help your tattoo. Use it during pregnancy as often as you can to soften the skin while it's stretching.|`|Jv2WIUDZaa	cocoa butter does help with strech marks from pregnancy but you want to start using it before your stomach really expands keeping the skin soft and elastic during the expantion will help prevent stretch marks and help keep tattoos ( to a lesser extent)  if you already have streatch marks try scar reducing creams.|`|16ffc7ceffd030636adf5aede378a4abaa	Im not sure cocoa butter would work but I know for a fact that A and D ointment will work perfectly.|`|73v0zRZ1aa	fhdfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff|`|q8IwKTfFaa	Help with what? stretch marks or healing?<br>  Cocoa Butter helps with stretch marks but I've never tried it on my tattoo|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Help with what and what does this have to do with tattoos?
kCdISEGqaa	Didn't you just ask this question?|`|oiQTd3Hpaa	It might. I've seen some pretty gnarly after-pregnancy tattoos, but I've also seen some tats that haven't changed at all. I think it depends on the elasticity of your skin, how well you look after your skin while you're pregnant, and how fast you get back to your pre-pregnancy shape. I'm sure if you take extra care during pregnancy it wont stretch out too bad.|`|Jv2WIUDZaa	its highly likely that it will get streched out,  it depends on how much weight you gain and where you carry your pregnancy (higher or lower)  how long between when your baby drops and when you actually give birth ETC.  I would go into it assuming the tattoo will stretch and just be happy if it doesnt.|`|vuxef3O4aa	yes, and no, ever one is different. it might or might not happen|`|73v0zRZ1aa	go to a doctor
ss48BEk5aa	it's an experimental procedure and not many people will do it. It's incredibly risky. They did a special on it on the discovery chanel. Interesting, but in my opinion it's very stupid. I'm all for tattoos, but not something that you can't cover up or un-do.|`|df487366c8df12bbfb39f682d5ee2235aa	I saw a show on tv about a dude that got the white of his eye tattooed black. It looked pretty awesome in my opinion and he said that it didn't hurt much. I think i remember him saying that it felt like something cold was touching his eye, i'm not sure. But I def. would not get it.|`|g3IXprk9aa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  Yes, I have seen people get their eye tattooed. There was a special on TV awhile ago (I forget which channel) and they had a guy on there that  was getting the color blue tattooed on his eye. It was definitely intense to watch. You might be able to look it up on youtube or something, you could type in eyeball getting tattooed, I'm not sure what the exact term would be, haha. It looked complicated, I'm sure someone REALLY experienced in body mods, not just tattoos would be the type of person to do something like that.|`|ODosyM8zaa	Hmmm never heard of it. But I have seen people that was metal shapes implanted in their eyes (stars, hearts, etc). True story|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	i seen a show on tv and a guy got his done. i would never in my right mind get one. it looks really painful.|`|zCdrLwcFaa	lil wayne has two|`|q8IwKTfFaa	I've seen one! My cousin's boyfriend has blue dots around the pupil. I imagine it would hurt because of how many nerves are in an eyeball, but for that reason you have to have your eye numbed

JCv8RaCNaa	The face cream is normally want u apply daily like 'fair n lovely' which can be used regularly, but moisturizer is the same thing but used when u want to be protected from sun in summer and in the winter it is used for avoiding rashes on the skin.The best moisturizer u can use is nova moisturizer|`|nTJQMzlHaa	Cream are heavier and are usually applied at night to restore moisture. <br>  <br>  Moisturizers, the effective ones, are light and are applied after you cleans your face during the day and keep your face from over-drying during the day.
3801WCKjaa	that sound expensive, it's hard to find cream for dark circles because most creams are for puffiness or wrinkles but i found this really good cream, u see results overnight and if u continue to use it the results get better, it's called "eyecon" it's by benefit,
gHT2ZPkFaa	Washing your face in the morning and before you go to bed is best. If you choose to wash your face only once a day do it at night. Oil, dirt, and other pollutants gather on your face during the days so you'll want to wash it all of at night.|`|joiacDUdaa	If you wear make-up you should probably wash your face in the AM/PM.... That way you take off your make-up and any dirt and oil.. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GOSMZMpwaa	I don't think it is enough. In the morning you wash your face. Great. But after a long day of debris and everything from outside getting on your face, you definitely need to wash it at night also. Like a mild cleanser. I use Neutrogena Acne Stress Control. It works!! I had a couple bumps that i just noticed. Used it last night. Today no bumps. :D<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Z4Rvf2pbaa	It is better if you wash once in the morning and again last thing at night, the reason being is that dirt and grime gets into your pores as the day goes on, clogging them and causing spots and blackheads, use a cleanser for your skin type, followed by a toner which closes your pores, then a moisturiser, if you are using soap then make sure u rinse it off well, then splash your face with cool water and pat dry the cool water will clos the pores back over, never leave pores open as you will defo get blackheads! hope this helps!
nzYTVEPwaa	I started wearing it when I was in the 8th grade. Just eyeliner & mascara. As I got older I started to wear more but not everyday. However, now I do it because I like to experiment with color & like experimenting with new techniques. I can go on about my day with or without it. However, when I do & I really like my make-up, I feel more self-confident. Make-up should be a way for you to express yourself, there's no right or wrong answer. :) *I'm 18 now & a senior in high school.|`|qbxkWDMbaa	Makeup is worn a lot at my school.<br>  I also am an eighth grader!<br>  It's funny you mentioned it,<br>  a few days ago a friend of mine came in and she had rubbed all of her left eye's makeup off. She's pretty heavy on the eyeliner and bright eyeshadows so she looked really goofy!|`|FxAWhiTWaa	I only wore a little bit of mascara, a tiny bit of eyeshadow and chap stick or lip gloss.<br>  <br>  * Spell check is your friend.|`|XF9596Xraa	All in for me, <br>  foundation<br>  concealer<br>  primer<br>  face color<br>  eyeliner<br>  eyeshadow<br>  mascara<br>  and lipgloss<br>  <br>  EVERYDAY!|`|1Y073bjiaa	Tbh when i was in the 8th grade, i didn't wear make-up.<br>  Im only just starting to wear it now, and my skin is better than all the other girls. When your in 8th grade, never were to much, because less is more. Make it look natural not so over the top, you look orange and like a wanna be plastic, because i bet you theres a gang in your year group that are wanna be plastics.|`|lO7xMVzQaa	At my school we're technically not supposed to wear it but most girls do (it's a girls school). The teachers can tell us to go wash it off but I think it doesn't affect how you work and it makes you feel more confident, so they can't tell you what to do!|`|QovnMnbNaa	I am in 8th grade and I wear pressed powder, sometimes foundation, concealer on dark circles and breakouts if I have any, as well as mascara, blush, and clear or baby pink lip gloss. I don't wear eyeliner that much because it makes me look washed out and its too harsh for me. Sometimes I wear eyeshadow (no dark colours usually)|`|GItWq2mGaa	I do!<br>  I wear:<br>  bare minerals<br>  dark brown eyeliner(on bottom)<br>  dark plumb eyeliner(on top)<br>  brown mascara<br>  clear lipgloss
HCwOuw3Laa	there's a few ways to do it I'm not trained at all and I've gave my sister's boyfriend them <br>  right I used backcombing which is quite messy but a good way to do it<br>  section out the hair into square inches or as thick as you want them then its optional but you can use hair wax to help shape them<br>  then when the hair is sectioned out you can start backcombing which is just brushing the hair upwards until it mats then if more shaping is required you can twist the matted hair in to dredlocks unless the hair is already in the shape of them<br>  <br>  some people just don't clean their hair and it gets matted but this normally happens with african americans|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	Oh please don't. They are sooo dirty looking and for a reason, you get them by not washing your hair and twisting the hair together to get it matted. Once you have them you don't just jump in the shower, you have to use dry shampoo (which doesn't really work). Whenever I see people with them it makes me sick knowing that they aren't washing their hair. <br>  <br>  To get rid of them, you basically have to cut them out, usually depending on how long you have had them.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Don't do it.<br>  To get them out you have to shave your hair.|`|ynFtyVKYaa	Your hair has to be thick like thick thick so they stay in..Also like ig you jus basically twist your hair....or u could jus get it done professional|`|G5Y725Tpaa	not entirely sure but don't try it yourself you might end up screwing up your hair permanently, get a proffesional to do it, its like 60+ dollars i think|`|8ENRWmoMaa	go to a black people salon, trust me.  Do not let a white person put dreads in your hair, it will just look like a waxxy bird nest.|`|AA11999436	There's an instruction video here <a href="http://www.afro-haircare.com/Dreadlock-instruction-video.php." rel="nofollow">http://www.afro-haircare.com/Dreadlock-i...</a> This method works with any type of hair, but you might have to tie the ends to start it off if your hair isn't very coarse.
IowG78BGaa	redissh brown/ auburn, my natural color is that it looks great with pale skin. or a dark brown, but that could make you look paler. both of these look great with green eyes.|`|REA33Itfaa	You can go light and if that works stick with it if it doesnt' go dark but wait for a month you don't want to damage your hair right away...|`|xgziZhNOaa	I think you should dye your hair brown. Light brown, like auburn.|`|jNpW0iTWaa	yeah, especially if you were tan, brown would look great on you.<br>  <br>  :)|`|KkRb3paPaa	i think brown hair might look nice on you|`|wwB3csfYaa	I think strawberry blond would look amazing on you. And if you can't afford to get it one professionally, got to your local beauty school and ask who does the best job and has the most experience. It cost about 25-30 dollars. The dye the use will actually stay in your hair, and give you the color you want, where the box, you just never know!<br>  Anyways, strawberry blonde will complement you very well!! <br>  PS if your friends are anything like mine were, they always tell you the opposite of what will REALLY look good one you, as much as they love you. I don't know why!
xqgE4CrBaa	Nothing is good makeup for 5-year-olds.

Personally other then that I don't think five year olds should be wearing makeup....|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I think you need to be able to spell the names of products you want to wear before you put them on.|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	dont put makeup on a 5 year old you freak. you should be locked up.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	just a lipgloss and nail polish for fun.....<br>  and let her eat her gummy bears for godness sake|`|KLZGmyL4aa	there is NO GOOD make up for 5 year olds..<br>  dont ruin her pretty face....|`|AA10930235	Makeup on a five year old??

1ZnzjCdlaa	your tattoo will stretch.it all depends on much weight you gain during your pregnancy. i have one on my ribs and i have a had a baby after getting on, and mine never stretch out.|`|q8IwKTfFaa	I'm sure everything stretches when you are pregnant expes. your stomach and side. After you had the tattoo for a while put some cocoa butter on it once you find out you are prego|`|k6it06fiaa	yes and it depends on how big you get when your pregnant on how much it will stretch|`|zCdrLwcFaa	yes|`|kAIXDVu1aa	yess but when you lose the '' baby'' weight if you excercise then it will come back to normal|`|H57vwVT2aa	Im sure it will strech some. The skin on your torso expands quite a bit when you get pregnate so im sure the tattoo will stretch some. It goes back though after you have the baby so its really no biggie.

elY5vkVyaa	You should be okay going to bed at 11pm but at your age maybe you need more sleep, I think 10pm would be a good time for you. One hour before bedtime switch off your TV or hi-fi or whatever and don't drink anything with caffeine in it.<br>  <br>  So if you aim to go to bed at 9pm, 7:59pm is the very latest you can have a cup of tea or coffee. 8pm the TV is switched off, NO EXCUSES. It's not easy to make it a routine but try it at least once.<br>  <br>  You'll be surprised how much easier it is to wind down when you get rid of the stimulation.|`|H57vwVT2aa	Get up at like 4 or 5 in the morning and STAY UP. If you do this you will go to bed really early that night and then you can get up at ur normal time. If you are doing a lot of things that stimulate your mind late at night you will always have a hard time getting to sleep. Try doing something that bores you. Maybe read the yellow pages or something haha. But if you do the whole getting up super early thing a few days in a row you will be ready for bed way earlier.|`|8ODX4OG0aa	One solution could be of forcing yourself awake bright and early in the morning, around 5 am. Stay awake the whole day and don't take any naps. When 7 o'clock rolls around, you'll start to feel drowsy. By 9-10 you'll be so tired that you'll have to sleep!<br>  <br>  Another solution would be to start doing mild or moderate physical activity right before and after dinner. This tires you and your body out, and then signals your brain that you are sleepy.<br>  <br>  The last solution would be to start a daily schedual (including weekends) Start doing to bed at 9:30 - even if you're wide awake , close your eyes. By closing your eyes for a long period of time should signal your brain to release the hormone that causes you to drift into a deep sleep. Keep at it for a whole week even on saturday and sunday to keep your mental clock functioning.|`|J38v75bvaa	this may not be the best advice but when that happens to me i stay up on night and the day after go to sleep at 9. figure out how much sleep you need to not be tired in the morning. if its 8 hours then wake up at 6. if you have to be up earlier, go to sleep earlier.|`|F3K80HHeaa	if you dont have work as in a job just go to sleep at 9. walk to your bed and get under your covers and sleep.|`|EGvBUet0aa	then go to bed at 9:00!

q8IwKTfFaa	I think the "tiger lilly" is creative. Also I wouldn't say the pain is 1 because it IS your shoulder blade which is bone so maybe 5. But since this is your first tattoo and you dont know what to expect, it might feel like 6 to you/|`|2cf99691bb36e8205d594c179df58bdeaa	scratch yourself with a needle repeatedly on one spot<br>  that's how it feels<br>  <br>  make sure you know EXACTLY what you want<br>  colour -style of tattoo- size<br>  search pics on google<br>  <br>  I don't fear for you getting a tiger lily<br>  your name is lily<br>  it's not like your getting something associated with your boyfriend<br>  <br>  your name will always be lily<br>  <br>  it's the design and where you put it which may trouble you in the future|`|aFYDZnU9aa	how old you have to be depends on where you live. in every state you have to be 18 to get a tattoo without a parent signature. in some states you can be as young as 15 with parent consent to get one. most states are 16 or 17 though. i personally don't have a tattoo but i imagine needles going into your skin wouldn't feel to good..but probably not all your bones braking bad..probably a level 6 or  7 depending where you get it|`|l5OMFTMUaa	I think its a really nice idea :) and becaues its on your shoulder blade you wont see it all the time and will probubly forget you even have it so i dont think you will get sick of it. i have a hibiscus on my upper right shoulder (above the shoulder blade) and the pain was very minimal... i barely felt a think... the worst part was the outline and i would say that was a 4 and the color was nothing... do it! good luck... oh yeah you have to be 18 in most states unless a parent or legal guardian signs for you :) you may be able to find someone to do it illigally but dont do it... it they are willing to take any buisness chances are its not going to be safe or clean or good work...|`|AA12032352	Sorry babe you can't get a tattoo until you are 18....gives you pleanty of time to think about it though and be 100% sure of what to get and where to get it.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	well i donk think its a 10, but at 15 you might feel like it now but you know that it is strong possibity that your mind will change years later, tatoos can be regretful even tough that is not a bad choice|`|AZeC5x42aa	Personally, I would not get a tattoo, but I won't push my opinion on you. Pain-wise, I've heard everything from a light sting to a sharp stab... And age-wise I think you are free to get one at 18 and MAYBE younger in certain states with a parent/guardian permission.<br>  <br>       Whatever you decide to do, just make sure that the place is very clean and reputable. Also, if you can, ask to see an example of their work... you don't want your pretty flower lopsided. =]<br>  <br>        I hope you like whatever you turn out with!|`|aLGe7JZEaa	I am pretty positive you MUST be 18.  I wasn't legally allowed to get one until then.  (I was about 15 when I tried to get one.)<br>  <br>  Depening on the size the pain varies.  My first tatt was on my shoulder about the size of a computer mouse.  It hurt at time level 1 then would get to a 5 back to 1 then 10.  It really wasn't that bad.  If I were you I'd wait.  What I wanted at 15 was not what I got at 18.  But ur name will always be Lily so that would be a cute tatt.|`|ODosyM8zaa	Most respectable tattoo parlors won't tattoo on a person unless they are at least 16 years old! WITH PARENT"S CONSENT. On  your shoulder blade I would say it's a 4 or 5. Definitely depending on how well you can handle pain! Lol good luck!|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	i think besides nevada there is no state in which you can get a tattoo under the age of 18 - even with parental consent. and yes it hurts, imagine a needle going into your skin over and over again. you dont sound mature enough to even be considering this.|`|BIFO1Vudaa	i have one of my own<br>  you have to be 18<br>  and it depends how tolerant to pain you are<br>  for me, it's about a 3, but it doesn't go away<br>  it's like getting a shot, but it lasts longer|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i think getting a lily tattoo because your name is lily would be cute. i have several tats and the ones on my shoulder hurt the least. like maybe a 2 out of 10.|`|EbHm2Hsoaa	in most staes you have to be 18 without parent consent. With parent consent you can be as young as 15. It doesnt hurt to bad I would say a 7!|`|w4EusdX3aa	You have to be 18 to get a tattoo.  To me getting tattooed feels like hot needles being dragged across your skin, but I love the feeling!|`|WKgm9qTkaa	Well shoulder blade can be painful depending on how much muscle/fat you have there. If your doing it right on the bone be prepared for it to hurt. However, it also depends on your pain tolerance. Some people really enjoy it, some people just think it feels like an annoying vibration. For me, I got one down my arm and I wont lie. It hurt like hell when the artist started to go under my arm. <br>  <br>  Everything feels different, like outlining feels different that coloring and shading because they use different brushes. For me the color hurt more because they were going over the same areas over and over again. Some parts on my arm I didn't feel at all.<br>  <br>  There's no way to really tell how much it'll hurt until you start having it done. If your really concerned, have them go over your skin a bit without ink in the brush, so if you really think you can't do it then you don't have to worry about having ink in your skin.<br>  <br>  As for the design, make it something personal to you. I like the idea of the lily. Sometimes it also helps to talk your design over with the tattooist because they can work off of what you give them.|`|NUSgnkdVaa	first thing is you HAVE to be 18 to get a tattoo, Its against the law in most places if your not. And the pain all depends on how much tolerance you have. I have one in my ear and it didn't hurt at all and i have one on my foot that i could have killed the guy for. but you should honestly wait until you are 18. Then you are an adult you can make that choice and not regret it. your only barley 15. You should really wait. and im sure any good tattoo artist will tell you the same.|`|0qW0rWlSaa	the age you need to be is 18 (although there are some that let you go under age, but i didnt tell you that OKAY? :P) <br>  <br>  if you want a Professional one done then i would suggest you wait until you turn 18. <br>  <br>  as for the pain factor, the outline hurts more than the shading, some people find it more painful than others, for example some people pass out. for me it didnt hurt, there was an initial shock because it wasnt what i was expecting, but after that the pain kind of became addicting in a weird sense.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|xp316HsLaa	If you REALLY want a tattoo try a henna tattoo or something that is not permanent. Depending on where the tattoo is it will hurt more or less. I am the same age as you and i would NEVER get a tattoo though because although its wrong, people sometimes judge you for tattoos and if god wanted you to have a lily on your shoulder, he would have given you one.|`|rBR6akgqaa	You have to be 18 to get one legally but there are ways around that, just remember whats cool at 15 or even 18 in my case ain't so cool at 38. As far as pain it feels like a localized sunburn after its done, as far as while its being done it depends on where. The rule is the less flesh the more pain. The ones on my biceps hurt less than the one i wish i didn't have on my shoulder. <br>  i feels like someone is just scraping the skin which is pretty much what they are doing.|`|RAr8frPZaa	I think that you shouldn't get a tattoo, because you're just 15 and most jobs won't hire you if you do have a tattoo,<br>  <br>  But then again, it's your body. I don't know how much it cost. But you do have to have a parent or legal guardian with you to sign all of the papers and stuff. I'm pretty sure that it really hurts because it's like a bunch of tiny needles just poking you. OUCH. Make sure you don't have any regrets|`|ARCF5U82aa	I would like get a tat of like tattoo himself..He was this fn pimp like midget who loved daisy chains and planes.As far as pain goes I would rate it like a cute blonde boys first night in prison.Painful but in the end somewhat enjoyable.Now I commit crimes just to get corn holed but that's enough about me.|`|k23GYs9iaa	you have to be 18 to get a tat. i had one done by my friend when i was 14. he had a homemade thing to give tats with. i got it on my shoulder and i barley felt it. i think that's the spot to get one with the least amount of pain. a lilly would be clever. hope this helps you.|`|GtNUIvQtaa	sounds cool to me. most artists porbly wont do the cuz of your age as people tend to not know what they want at that age and make hasty decision.  if your abslutely sure try person that works at home but is professional. plus your parents will have to approve before any artsit will do it.|`|8QrrlBwIaa	You have to be 18 to get a tattoo.<br>   Anyone who tells you it doesn't hurt is a liar.

You have to be 18, but you can get it younger with parents permission.|`|6yhHCgTUaa	Alot proberly because on bone... in england 18 not sure about anywhere else. But i think thats a nice idea as it kinda has sentimental value.... But maybe wait a little longer so dont regret it.|`|JgMROVqeaa	that would be really cute with the name and everything because my friend who is also 15 actually got a small butterfly on the back of her left shoulder (we are normal haha) and it looks really good in dresses and bathing suits. just think it over if thats what you want and you have to get parent parmission unless you're 18. she said it hurt less than she expected so about a 6 probably.

AA10011909	i really like this brand because it uses a lot of natural materials and it's not harsh on your skin. the makeup is really light but it still works well, it's really good for sensitive skin.  it isn't too expensive either, and they make a lot of different products now, like lip gloss and eyeshadows. you can buy it pretty much anywhere, like target, walmart or ulta. <br>  <br>  my only complaint is that there isnt that much selection or variation in terms of color for their products, but if youre looking for any kind of face powder or earth-toned products, i would definitely reccomend it :]|`|QffgZx7Iaa	that makeup is good i use it because i have really sensitive skin and redness and it covers it pretty good they are very fragile one time i bought one of their compacts and had it in my purse and when i wanted to touch up my make up all of it was crushed|`|mHOvddIvaa	I like their blushes, bronzers, concealer, and translucent powders. I've heard their mascara sucks though.|`|nzYTVEPwaa	I think it's good but they are very fragile (more easier to break).|`|a6j0cwgqaa	I remember really liking them! But I love Neutogena liquid makeup!

XIIGr5f2aa	if you go to dailymakever.com, you can download a picture of yourself and try different hairstyles. it actually looks pretty real. and if you download just 1 picture or yourself, it's free, but has limited hairstyles to choose from. if you want to download more than 1 picture and get more hairstyles, it does cost money. hope this helps (:|`|ynFtyVKYaa	Straighten your hair, or make it wavy and let down, putting your hair up do that lil bump paris hilton in front(hair in ponytail)..Put clip in back of your hair..That would look soo cute cuz my lil cuz is 12 with long brown hair and it looks pretty like that..or put some back like selna gomez  www.misquincemag.com/media/cm/misquincem...|`|b609KrkEaa	Im 13. Im a big fan of a site model named Lauren Cyrus. If you're into her type of look you should blow dry your hair straight, get deep side bangs cut, use some hair spray that gives your hair volume and make it sorta messy looking.

tXmu16Niaa	I would tell the person at the counter that it is your first time and ask what would be a good start out time to begin with.  Then, you can work your way up to the full time for the tanning bed.  This way it reduces your chances of getting burned the first time through.  Be sure to moisturize at night before you go to bed.  Tanning beds can really dry out your skin.  Don't worry if you do burn a little, it will not peel, but it will feel uncomfortable.  Also, don't just lay in one position for the whole time.  Your tan will be off, like if you lay on your bed everytime, your butt will get the darkest fastest.  Just try and lay on your back half the time and stomach half the time.  It may be a little uncomfortable, but at least you will have an even tan.  To me, it does help having a tanning lotion with you.  Don't buy the most expensive kind.  I like the kind that has Hemp Seed Oil, in it, because it smells good and darkens you quicker.  Good luck and be careful!|`|SXm75cZtaa	Be careful and don't go to dark. Also, I would just use self tanner, I don't know why, but tanning salons seem more dangerous because of the way the heat is put onto your skin.|`|8PwUkJwJaa	i started out going on 5 minutes and working my way up so it was a gradual tan. also use the tanning lotion they give you and idk thats it its pretty simple

Z2uYisnAaa	Maybelline Expert Wear comes of pretty easy because you can smudge it but it lasts on pretty good too <br>  and they have almay makeup remover pads at the drugstore/walmart and eyeliner too|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	You can use extra virgin olive oil, it sounds weird but it really takes it off. You can try to use a kohl eyeliner. They are really cream and come off easily when you want it to.|`|m25lpepOaa	If you are under the age of sixteen (i'm assuming) you don't need makeup. I know it makes you feel 'adult' or whatever, but to be completely honest you look ridiculous. I pick my younger sister, who is thirteen, up from school everyday, and seeing all of the 12-14 year-olds wearing thick makeup makes them look...well, i'd hate to use this word, but "hoochy". <br>  <br>  I mean, come on. Makeup was made for adults who want to look younger. If you are under the age of sixteen, what do you need to look younger for? Be one of the very few children who are trying to keep their child-like ways. Don't grow up too fast, or you'll regret it.|`|h7igZipgaa	Hahah dont worry my routine is go straight to the bathroom when I get home and wash off my eyeshadow and mascara with warm water haha :]<br>  Anyway since you want a drugstore eyeliner I think Covergir and Maybelline are the best in drugstores ;]<br>  Here are some links for eyeliner<br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=perfect_blend_eyeliner" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/EyeLiner/line-express-eyeliner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Ey...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|atn30lRPaa	cvs has some like the maybelline|`|AA10011909	haha i used to do the same exact thing. i just used a cheap eyeliner brand, like rimmel, which lasts pretty well (so you dont have to reapply it a million times at school) but comes off pretty easily with eye makeup remover.<br>  <br>  instead of looking for eyeliner that doesnt last, you might want to try just bringing eye makeup cleaning pads with you to school. that's what i did, and it was a lot easier.  just buy a small package you can fit in your bag; it's not expensive and you wont have to scrub your eyeliner off at the end of the day. Almay works well and it's cheap, you can pretty much find it anywhere, like target, walmart, ulta, etc. :]|`|OhRzYL4yaa	I really like Maybeline Define-a-line. It is awesome. It also is really easy to come off. It either comes off in the shower, when you wash your face, or with eye makeup remover. It also has a buffer at the end to make the eyeliner smudge in more and look more natural. I'm not sure about the cost of it, but it's good.
IYgiWL3Haa	Yeah, just go to the post office and tell them you need a envelope to send it out in and a little bubble wrap. They will wrap it up for you. Then just write her name and address on the outside of the envelope and give it to the post office manager. She will then tell you how much it is, I swap on makeup alley and normally it's only 3 to 5$ to send something small out. Then pay her and she will send it on its way. :D

It is called jetset and comes in a little pot with a brush. You have to buy it oline, costs around 20 pounds. I have tried loads and this is by far the best - doesn't budge at all!
PN7XMglOaa	Amelia , with a positive attitude , like yours , you will be a top model , don't ever give up your dream . Contact an agency , here in America .|`|ydHU7gYIaa	well first off, angela who answered before me is an f'ing moron. women who work as plus size models are required to have beautiful bodies, just as straight models do. and who said skinny was required to wear a swimsuit?! its idiots like her that make people ashamed to live in america; and im guessing she couldnt be a model if she had 4 million bucks worth of plastic surgery, so the jealousy is obvious. that said do NOT send out nude photos; you are not trying to get into porn here, and any respectable agency would ban you for life. your proportions have to be just about perfect to be a plus size. it sounds like your chest may be too big, but that would depend on the rest of your body. also, just being full figured isnt going to get you booked. you must be at LEAST 5'9(but usually youll get passed over for taller girls if youre the minimum height) and must have a gorgeous face with excellent bone structure. theres unbelievably competitive in the plus-size world- even more so than what straight models suffer. you are constantly rejected, and have to be just about perfect in order to book anything. i am very very lucky to be a working plus size model, and if i were just one inch shorter, i probably wouldnt have booked half the runway shows or print i have (im 5'10 and a size 8). a size 14 is actually perhaps a little too large to be a model in most respects; you may be asked to drop down two sizes. you first must send professional quality photos out to agencies (beauty shots, which are shoulders-up, full body, swimsuit, profile)  if youre serious, and let them know your height, weight, size, etc. the fact that it sounds like you live in a smaller town, though, will make it nearly impossible to get signed with an agency; you must live in or close to the city where the agency is located (almost always in a big city), so that will be a factor in getting signed. its so so tough, and many girls cant handle it, since perfection is so sought after in this industry|`|6qVpZSosaa	Contact bravissimo and send them a picture of you they should email you back saying wether they need you or not.|`|Vdutn1GYaa	I ask myself the same thing, only I live in NYC.|`|fSXGtQv0aa	ewww swimsuit? theres a reason why swimsuit are skinny.....duh!|`|p5VKqKU7aa	i would say contact bravisimo or other agencies|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	contact an american agency and come to new york city when u turn 18<br>  they have all kinds of models and it is very diverse and welcoming|`|T7DRcINtaa	Ways to get your self publisized is to take some pictures exposing your face and your good qualities..maybe even naked.

Just keep encouraging her and tell her that she's really pretty and the people who doesn't think so is just jealous (because most of the time, that's the case).<br>  If boys like her than she must be doin smth right and they're prob jealous that she can get guys and they cant. Or better looking ones. Hehe ;p|`|6jXuUCdraa	shes okay..|`|kAfZaLwraa	Self-esteem has to come from inside, not from the opinions of strangers. She can't have that low of a self-esteem if she's posing for photos to post on the web asking for opinions of how she looks. <br>  <br>  Rather than focus on how she looks (thereby reinforcing the idea that she should be validated based on her physical appearance) maybe you should brush off her "Am I pretty?" questions with an, "Of course" and move on to other topics. Focusing on her intellect, kindness, sense of humor, etc, will help validate her a human being. Then maybe she'll stop seeking validation as an object by hooking up with random boys at parties.|`|FxBcccS6aa	shes like a 5.<br>  i think she shouldnt pose like that in the second picture.<br>  && it doesnt matter if she goes to parties or how many guys she hooks up with . <br>  everybody does that...|`|rjsB4oDkaa	this is SO obvious its you. it even says it as the top it says meeeeeeeee203 <br>  and i guess your pretty ..|`|FDgarm4Zaa	how can we rate her if we dont have a picture ?|`|XPHjwO75aa	Dang!

37E2yPGjaa	If you're nailbiting is severe, first coat what's left of your nail in a nasty tasting polish. You can find these at most pharmacies. Then wear lightweight, cotton gloves when you're at home. If you bite when your bored - try to keep busy but make sure you're wearing the gloves to do nearly EVERYTHING...You'll be used to them after an hour or two and when you reach your hand to your mouth - you'll get a mouthful of cotton instead of nail. You can also try displacing your chewing for a while. Chew some sugar free gum or even a child's teething ring for a few days. You don't want either of these to become another habit, but displacement for a few days can help. Keep the foul tasting polish on your nails all the time - since you likely won't wear the gloves in public, you will want some backup protection. <br>  <br>  If you're biting is not as severe, you can still use the polish, but you might try some other tips. For women, getting acrylic nails, or even those glue ons in the cosmetics department at Wal-Mart, makes a big difference. The "fake" nail will protect your little nub underneath and allow it grow. The fake nail will be much more durable and for many people (myself included) you're less likely to chew them to bits if you pay hard earned money to have them look nice.|`|UjkuDRtWaa	I have the same problem, maybe if you bring something around with you all day, to keep you entertained, that will help? Because you usually start biting when your bored.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I think I wasted my time answering, because I'm not an expert.<br>  Anyway, I hope my Idea helped just a bit :)|`|niPUH1vaaa	have you tried using stuff that they put on babies fingers.

Are they sun spots? If they are, then try Lancome Erase Sun Damaging, or Clinique skin cream to even them out. If you are on a budget, Aveeno skin cream evens out the skin almost as well. If they are scars from injuries, what always works for me (I fell on my bike a few years ago and I had pretty bad scars) is aloe vera and cocoa butter. I put the cocoa on one day and the aloe on the next, and alternated like that. The Aloe vera dried out the skin, but the cocao butter moustirized the skin.

Also try a chic sundress, (above and just at the knee length) and clinch your waist with a thing belt in a bright color. Also, boy-ish chic styles are in now. So i would do a bermuda short and just a plain white v-neck, cute belt and a bright bag.|`|FY6vBHhsaa	i would do a skirt with like a flowy tank top with uggs is super cute. or you could do a skirt with a polo. also shorts with a button up shirt. <br>  <br>  have funn =)

AA10011909	7 is definitely too young; your body is still developing and when you straighten your hair, you're damaging it way too early and it might not recover. same thing with makeup, it's way too early to ruin your skin like that when it isn't necessary and really just makes the child look more strange.<br>  <br>  i think about 13 or 14 is a good age to start, basically once they hit junior high.  but i think they should start slowly and wear minimal makeup, and then add more once they start to mature. it's different for everyone. :]|`|7KfbWBNpaa	i started wearing things like lip gloss a little mascara and some eyeshadow sometimes or maybe bronzer  when i was like 12, i personally did start wearing foundation till about age 14-15 just cause i didnt need but some of my other friends have been wearing a full face of foundation and other make up since they were 11 or 12, depends on the individual and i think it has a lot do with whether or not they have big sisters as they just wanna be like them. x|`|F3K80HHeaa	i bet they were one of the girls that are in the kids pageant. but yeah whenever they need makeup. i think the right age would be around 14 but not too heavy. maybe some mascara and some foundation. after 16 you can put on more makeup. As for young girls, they can put on some eye shadow  not heavy a color that sort of matches their skin and with some lip gloss.|`|eqCfPDpRaa	id say 10 is a good age .. thats when i started .. well actually i really started at 5 .. but not eyeliner or anything fancy .. just some eyeshadow, mascara, lip gloss and a lil blush (all done by my mom)|`|MEBkl5Iraa	i think a girl at age 7 should wear only wear lipgloss n maybe light color eyeliner|`|5Bp769DSaa	i personaly was like 13 and i find it wierd when i see kids with makeup on its just wrong.|`|CVmK0F3aaa	whenever they need it|`|IvIatEg3aa	Honestly, I think whenever they're ready for it. As long as they're not still kids and they don't cake it on.|`|OhRzYL4yaa	well there isn'tt an exact age where people should wear it or not. As long as it makes them feel better about themselves and as long as their parentsapprovee, I think it's fine. I wear a little bit of eyeliner and foundation everyday. It makes me feel more confident. It may seem like a lot but it really isn't. Some girls at my school wear way too much and when you see them without makeup on, they look like a totally different person. I don't know if you're asking for our advice because you want to wear makeup, but I'd say whenever you really want to and as long as you don't make yourself look like a complete skank.|`|2ea15ae437d18842cb5b04f24e51d97baa	preferrbly when starting high school|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	Lipstick and mascara at 13.<br>  Everything else after 15.|`|msVN7GBpaa	14|`|Gew6pZhbaa	It just depends on how much. I probably would have laughed at that 7-year-old. Wearing gloss, or shadow at 10-12 isn't a big deal. I think around 13, mascara, liner and powder is ok, and 14 and older it's up to you. It just depends on how they put it on.|`|9dKPDLrWaa	like 11-13 depends... but relly little ... it ruins ur natural skin and beauty... just like clear lip gloss, mascara maybe some eyeliner ocasionaly, and sometimes light coloured eyeshadow...|`|KDXisAOlaa	7 is waaayy too young for make up i started wearing it at 13.|`|atn30lRPaa	i would say when they start high school 14-15

Some grow out of self consciousness naturally by their late 20’s—some never grow out of it which is why I'd suggest you get a head-start by reading self image psychology books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz (which I have no financial interests and a book that everyone should read at least once). If you feel any of it is beyond you, focus on the parts about self consciousness and being happy. <br>  <br>  And then after you gain some insights to self image psychology and later on want to build true self esteem so you can feel good about you even on a bad hair day or when you really make a big mistake or look clumsy or have three zits, or what ever, then take advantage of the references below.|`|ZV0iipJmaa	NEVER|`|nUU9U9Asaa	I just think its crazy.<br>  <br>  I am that way about my weight too.

7uGMyGn2aa	I cant stand it when girls cry - it pisses me off BIG TIME! its defo not cute cause most of the time its a pathetic attempt at getting some attention. <br>  I look 4 a good personality in a girl - obv good looks as well else i wont really take much notice to find out her personality! But im not bothered so much aslong as she is not too fat and not too skinny - jst nice curves. I like a girl who can have fun, likes to be herself and laughs a lot - and does not cry! lol! Plus someone who has aspirations 4 life, is not lazy and likes tennis :p|`|k4T1Jgblaa	I guess crying shows you're vulnerable -- which is kinda nice in this<br>  'oh so confident, take me as you find me' arrogant age.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	Why do guys think it's cute when a girl cries?<br>  First of all, we don't always think that.  We hate when girls cry because of us or too much.  We think it's cute when a girl cries about an outside source because we are designed to want to protect and fight for you girls.  When you cry, it makes us want to cuddle you and make it better then go out there and find what is making you cry and fight it.  It's just the way guys are.  You girls are just as quirky as we are, if not more so. ;)<br>  <br>  What do guys usually look for in girls?  Boobs or Butt or Other?<br>  Well, tough question.  This is where guys differen amongst eachother.  Some guys are boob guys, other guys are legs/butt guys.  Personally, I prefer nice slender/fit legs and a small/muscular butt over big boobs.  I actually prefer smaller boobs anyhow.  But still, I'll take a nice face over either.  There really isn't one thing guys like over another, and it's really just the attractor.  Having a hot body and a cute face isn't going to keep guys hanging around, you've GOT to develop a supportive, respectful, fun and interactive personality to keep a guy.  It's much more than just physical appearance.  All I can say is just work to keep yourself fit and inshape, put a little pride in your appearance and just concentrate on your personality and how you interact with guys.  There's a whole lot to that, so I can't just write it all in here.  Just keep in mind that men value respect from their girlfriends over love (opposite of women).  And men crave constant attention and praise (we're a lot like puppy dogs actually) and you'll be just fine!|`|AA11768475	I guess I didn't no guys thought it was cute when a girl cries (I'm a guy).  And personally a cute face with a nice smile and well done hair is usually what attracts me to a girl.  Though if they are dressed to draw attention to boobs or butt, yeah I'll probably look at those.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I actually find it pretty disheartening to see a girl cry.  It's tragic actually and it bums me out. <br>  <br>  Sure female curves are often accentuated to get a guy's attention but to keep my attention - well that's what a personality is for!|`|etXYn0sCaa	I don't think its cute when women cry - crying doesnt show a capacity for feeling, it shows a capacity for crying.<br>  bums and boobs are equally good - provided they dont go down south the minute she takes her clothes off...|`|WUhE9Vi0aa	A guy thinks it's cute when a girl shows her natural sensitivity so that is why they think it's cute for a girl to cry. It depends on the guy for they look for. Some guys look for smarts and a pretty face. Others, as it pains me to admit, do look for a hot tiny butt to grab and huge breasts to suck on like a little baby. As you can tell it disgusts me. So be yourself [ I know it sounds corny but it's right] and the right guy will come along.|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	i dont know any guy that thinks it's "cute" when a girl cries. most find this very annoying and very unattractive. and if you are looking for a guy that wants you based on your looks alone - that's pretty shallow.|`|iMaYLGECaa	guys only find it a little bit cute when girls cry if they know how to handle it and if they know exactly what to say or do to make them feel better<br>  and if guys are only looking for boobs or butt then they're far too shallow|`|8lwGjvQpaa	i look at what sticks out the most -which CAN be a personality

5yn7Wh7Aaa	Try not to eat late, and don't drink anything with caffeine in it after 5pm.<br>  <br>  Don't nap in the day, and try to do some exercise late in the day.<br>  <br>  Don't use your computer or TV for an hour before you go to bed as it stimulates your brain and you find it harder to relax.<br>  <br>  Try having a window open in your room, and have a bath using something like lavender oil in the water before you do go to bed, and then read a book that's pretty easy going, or listen to some mellow music.<br>  <br>  If this has been going on for a while, it is likely you are stressed about something, and you should go to see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7nrhPCf0aa	idk. i have the same problem though. lol|`|rjsB4oDkaa	you could try sleep  medication|`|37a6c8320b8d6c53cc6b5bc5f10c6e0faa	Me too!<br>  sometimes i play a song on repeat<br>  try to make up a movie in your head lol when u think about things going on in your life you'll NEVER get to sleep|`|FDgarm4Zaa	this used to happen to me,<br>  i went to the doctor, and she gave me a sleeping pill.|`|zaYGRmOAaa	Count backwards from 100...only count every other number though.

My daughter has been taking it for about 3 years now she is 13. Works for her. Just make sure you get a good 8 or 9 hours to sleep.|`|qbxkWDMbaa	Try listening to music that relaxes you.<br>  Try taking a relaxing bath an hour before you go to sleep.<br>  Be sure to get plenty of exercise during the day, or else your energy won't leave your body.<br>  Don't drink many energy drinks or coffee during the day.<br>  <br>  If none of this works, You might want to consult a doctor and get sleeping pills.|`|NLt1s6egaa	when you are lying in bed , just relax and take a deep breath and close your eyes , then imagine you are falling into a big soft comfortable bean bag type thing and then eventually you will just drop off (worked for me anyway) :) x|`|oSZIGnj1aa	Try listening to music.

iHna2K7Gaa	A wide-tooth comb is better for your hair, especially if you're trying to untangle it while it's wet. Using a hairbrush or a regular comb can damage your hair.<br>  <br>  A good way to get rid of tangles is when you're showering and you condition your hair, run a wide-tooth comb through your hair while the conditioner is setting. Then wait for however long it says to keep it in before you wash it out, then repeat. It makes your hair a little more manageable later. Also, whenever you comb your hair, don't comb it from the crown down to the ends because the comb will get caught in the tangles and break your hair. Instead start in short strokes at the ends of your hair to work out the tangles down there, then work your way up. Again, if your hair is very tangled it should be with a wide-toothed comb, then you can go back with a regular comb later if you want.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|MSI5s64faa	a large paddle brush...it does not pull the hair as much. Always spray a detangler or leave-in conditioner into the hair before attempting to remove tangles. <br>  <br>  Never comb tangles out with a fine tooth comb!|`|jez0O0bXaa	When wet a wide tooth comb and you can work down to smaller tooth.  Start at the bottom and work up.|`|cQJGaUK4aa	Wide tooth comb is best when you have tangles...|`|1jUHQxWmaa	I'd say wide tooth-- less snags and reduces frizz. A brush is best for tangles, though.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Wide tooth..or a Detangle comb.|`|HQmAP5EVaa	You should always use a wide toothed comb on your wet tangly hair.

U2FBDStxaa	I noticed that when i tried to put a lot of things on my face like vanishing creams and facial washes that it drys my face out... a lot. For me it is more effective to use only a few products. I use Clean & Clear moisturizer and one spot vanishing cream. It works and since i don't use a lot, my face doesn't dry out. <br>     If you don't want to waste your products, use only a few during the weekdays and all or close to all on the weekends. <br>    Also i heard Clearasil has a face wipe made for only blackheads.

Try using Aveeno, it's made for sensitive skin (and its a pretty good price).<br>  If your skin continues to peel (or if you don't want to purchase a different product) go see a dermatologist or your doctor. They can assess your condition and give you medicated facewash/cream that will help or they can suggest products you can use.<br>  They know better than a Clinique site.|`|5yn7Wh7Aaa	Things you can do to help your skin:<br>  <br>  1. pin back your fringe when you are at home. It is making your forehead oily and will make the spots worse.<br>  <br>  2. drink loads of water. I would also recommend that you make sure you are eating lots of fruit and veg every day. Try to avoid junk foods too becausr it makes it worse.<br>  <br>  3. don't touch your face unless you are certain your hands are clean. <br>  <br>  4. I would suggest using a different foundation. Try and use a mineral foundation as they are so much better for your skin, and it is definitely worth investing in something good because it will help you so much. If you are based in the UK, try Lily Lolo foundation, it is fantastic. I use it.<br>  <br>  5. Your skin shouldn't peel when you cleanse tone and moisturise. I'd change products if I were you - the Simple range is great.<br>  <br>  6. DON'T use astringient products on your skin as it will make it worse in the long run.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|en208Kfoaa	Go to Clinique.com and take the skincare test and it will let you know what products to use.|`|JP5YKFdZaa	Im about to turn 16 and I had bad acne too, i use proactive but its actually not working for me to much anymore, and i were ALOTT of makeup too school but u should try going to a dermatologist and start taking off your makeup right when u get home. Makeup always clogs my pours, that's the down fall of it and for peeling i would say to get a really good moisturizer. For blackheads i use the Biore nose strips that you leave on for 10 minutes they really helped and i also put a mask on for 10 minutes every saturday :D. I really hope your acne clears uppp!

I have heard (&seen) several horrible examples of people doing that. I know a woman who went to south american to get a nose job & now she permanently looks like the keebler elf... not cute. Plus she has breathing issues now. Many plastic surgeons in the US (I'm not sure where you're from) will not TOUCH someone who has had plastic surgery done in another country simply because it's too risky. I'd definitely do some homework & research good plastic surgeons ( & legit!) before you make such a big decision. Good luck.

MSI5s64faa	no a relaxer will not turn straight hair curly.  Relaxers do not know color, meaning they do not know if your hair is that of a black person or white person. There are however different strengths for the coarseness of the hair.<br>  <br>  I have used relaxers on many people, black, white, and hispanic....If you really want it I recommend going to a stylist.<br>  <br>  One thing to think about is that a relaxer is extremely strong, and like any chemical treatment, will damage your hair.  If left on too long you can burn your scalp, or even make your hair break off at the scalp.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think that relaxers should be used by anyone other than those that have extremely kinky hair, that will not lay down or cooperate.  If you just have curly hair, it is not worth it to use a relaxer, as it dries the hair out considerably.<br>  <br>  I do the thermal straightening in my salon, also called japanese straightening, and I dont prefer it either. It just does too much damage to the hair. It is better to just straighten with a flat iron and good products.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	No...A chemical Relaxer is completely different then a Perm(Which uses rodes.), Chemical relaxers aren't good for your hair because they're chemical.

It most likely contains chemicals that would be too harsh for your hair. Try finding a relaxer for your type of hair. Better yet, get it done at a salon that knows what they're doing.|`|73v0zRZ1aa	ya|`|MUXGYj7Saa	There's different relaxers for different types of hair so I would buy the one that best fits for your type of hair.|`|0Whr62Vvaa	I've tried many different types of that relaxers and honestly it depends on the type or brand, and strength of the relaxer. I haven't heard of a relaxer made specifically for a certain race, although there are wide range of strengths. One factor to consider first, is whether or not you've ever had a chemical treatment.<br>  <br>  It's commonly thought hair that's never been treated or "virgin hair" will tolerate chemical treatments better than hair that has. Other things to think about when considering a relaxer are different strengths such as mild, normal, and strong. The strength is based on the texture or coarseness of the hair. Results can vary depending on your hair type and whether or not you have any other type of chemical treatment in your hair such as color, a perm, highlights, etc. <br>  <br>  BE CAREFUL if you already have a chemical treatment in your hair as it can do A TON of damage to your hair. Remember, like any other chemical treatment it CAN damage your hair so keep in mind, that if left on too long it can burn your scalp, or even make your hair break off... So when considering a relaxer or any chemical treatment it's best to see a professional stylist. And, NO a relaxer won't not turn straight hair curly.<br>  <br>  There's also something called a Japanese straightener. This uses a chemical, followed by treatment with a straightening iron or similar device. It works wonderfully, but be warned before considering this. It can do a lot of damage to the hair.<br>  <br>  Generally, it's better to just straighten with a flat iron and products, unless you really want this and are willing to take the necessary measures to properly care for it.

VN2wyTnFaa	There's no school for you to go to because in the makeup artist industry, no one really cares if you go to school. As long as you can produce good work, people will hire you and continue to work with you. If you want to work on photo shoots, one thing you should know is that you're going to start out working for nothing. The best thing you can do is actually working as an assistant for established makeup artists so you can learn tricks of the trade, what mediums work for photography, for color, for black and white, etc. From there, if you can produce good work under other makeup artists, they're likely to suggest you to other clients.

Mac makes a great one!<br>  <br>  It got me through all the tears on my wedding day without ruining my $100 makeup job!|`|AA10011909	of course, almost all mascaras these days come with a waterproof version. chances are, the mascara you're using now has a waterproof version.  when you go to the store, look for 'waterproof' on the package, a lot of the time the bottles even have blue detailing on them. they're not expensive and you can find it at any drug store/target/ulta or wherever else you may buy your makeup. <br>  <br>  it stays on well and only comes off with makeup remover :]|`|t1Lz8Ox1aa	yes try:<br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P190024&categoryId=C17357&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P230234&categoryId=C17357&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  or if you want liquid:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P148013&categoryId=C17357&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P138204&categoryId=C17357&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  or you could try this, which goes over your eyeliner and helps it to stay on:<br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P216625&categoryId=C17357&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a>|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i think ive seen it in the max factor section. but as for  it coming off try putting on eyeliner and then put that color eyeshaddow over it..it works wonders for me and stays on longer than just eyeliner.|`|Bc3htRBYaa	yea u can get waterproof eyeliner. any drug store has them.<br>  try the Maybelline Unstoppable Smudge-Proof Waterproof Eyeliner<br>  i love it!!!|`|1T3J0Fmgaa	hahahaha! ofcourse there is!<br>  just go anywhere.<br>  i usually go 2 alta cuz i love it there, <br>  but u can get it in the simplest places like wal mart!

IowG78BGaa	a medium brown or dark reddish would look great especially with curls.|`|gi7vbgOIaa	it would look really cute|`|FWUSLQN2aa	I think the two streaks of a funky color like purple is going to look the best, highlights in black hair dont look right, but colorful colors that express you are perfect. i think you should go with the purple, because even a little change with something so fun and flirty, will make you feel fun and flirty and feel like youve made a change. but yep, thats what i think. goodluck.|`|MtMUoxVgaa	I think purple Highlights throughout ur whole hair would look nice because purple is hard to see in black hair but would be a little change for you.|`|b609KrkEaa	I have hair light brown and super curly.

Z4Rvf2pbaa	Hi there I had the same thing happen with one of my piercings and its a bubble thats a mix of fat and fluid and can either go hard or stay pretty soft, aspirin will not help, aspirin is taken to thin the blood and to stop clotting, this is not a clot from what you describe, sometimes you can be left with this and it wont go away, think a visit to the docs to determine for sure what it is , is your only solution, should it become infected in anyway, say if your constantly fiddling around ith i then you will need to get a course of anti biotics as infections tend to hit most or all piercing holes! good luck|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Hey well sorry I have no piercings on my face BUT it sounds like your lip is oozing puss (is it a light yellowish colour?)<br>  So yeah you could possibly have an infection and if you're concerned you should go see a doctor.<br>  Try to keep the area clean for now.<br>  I don't really know much else but I hope this helps you ;p

8q68VTJeaa	Usually a department store like Macy's or Dillard's (if you have them). Some places like you to call and let them know because they (especially on weekends) have appointments for things like weddings and stuff.|`|TzeYsXKGaa	Most makeup counters in a department store will do it for free!|`|fEjor827aa	Faces by Anne Miller.<br>  <br>  google it to see where one is in your area. or im not really sure if it's a chain but you could research a place like that. and it's really not that much it's just buying the makeup that makes you lose all your money.|`|bhyUX6kkaa	You can go to makeup counters in department stores and makeup stores. I would be careful though, every time I've tried this they made me look like a prostitute or a barbie doll. It is relatively free, you usually only need to buy a product they used on you.<br>  The art of makeup subtle and it takes skill to enhance someone's beauty with out bearing down on it.<br>  Another option is to hire a makeup artist, but that will cost you a minimum of hundreds each time.<br>  <br>  Since my experience with makeup counters I've become a makeup artist myself and so would suggest that your best option for continuous good makeup application would be to learn it yourself. <br>  You don't have to go to a professional school for months and thousands of dollars. There are courses you can buy and learn all the tricks of the trade your self.<br>  I would recommend using one that goes into full detail about beauty makeup instead of buying lots of segmented courses (i.e. smokey eye, lips....)<br>  I used the event makeup artist and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in applying makeup either to themselves or as a business. <br>  <br>  Using any sort of at home course will end up being cheaper that hiring a good makeup artist or buying lots of overpriced department store makeup.|`|AA10011909	you can go to stores like sephora or any makeup counters like MAC to get your makeup done.  they sometimes pressure you a little to purchase the products they're using, but obviously you don't have to. they usually do it for free. :]|`|LZgVsIpKaa	You can go get your make-up done at Debenhams (the department store) for free!|`|Q7rUmJt7aa	The mall...pffff, damn you would look hotter if ya just did it at home in the mirror. dont let other fags or women do it|`|SCCsexU3aa	i like m.a.c. or any make up counter at Macy's

O21CyKtZaa	I have both piercied. I got my nose dome june last year and my naval three days ago. I got my nose done with a gun but that's not the safest way to go. A professional piercer explained to me why so you should go with a needle. The pain is probably the same. It didn't hurt to me. All you feel is just like pain for a second and that's it. I got it on the left side and my left eye got watery but I wasn't crying lol I guess because there's nerves in the nose. And for the naval DO NOT use a gun! The needle has to go in at an angle and the gun doesn't do that! And its only 10 seconds of pain! Lol and after its just tender so yeeeeeah it kinda hurts if u bend too much or touch it|`|eN5xA6RKaa	its not safe to pierce anything except lobes with a gun. ive never heard of anyone piercing a bellybutton with a gun. get it done with a needle. and neither is too bad, ive had both. bellybutton hurt me alittle more than the nose but still nothing that i couldnt tolerate.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Guns aren't the safes way to pierce, that's why they're only used on ears, because they're the least likely to become infected. When I got my nose pierced, she used a needle, and same with my navel. Your nose is by far less painful. It feels the same as getting your ears pierced. Your navel on the other hand, hurts like no other, and it doesn't go away for a while. It's difficult to sleep, sit, and drive for the first week or so, and if you're lucky it won't get infected or reject. The needle going in doesn't feel too bad, but when I had mine done she had the clamp on so tight I lose all feeling lol.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	I don't think you can get either with a gun?<br>  <br>  Only ever use gun for lobes.<br>  <br>  And needle for everything else,including cartlage.<br>  <br>  It hurts less,better for your body,and the healing process is faster.<br>  And needle doesn't hurt.|`|tjRuKlJaaa	generally its always done with a needle. don't do it with a gun! even if they give you the option don't do it.|`|cUHb4XWyaa	Never use a gun for piercings...it's really unsafe. It can shatter the cartliage (for tragus' anyway...unsure about nose and navel).<br>  <br>  Everywhere else will tell you that guns are unsafe.|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	i dont think places will do it w/ a gun - that is generally reserved for ears only.
82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	I know this sounds odd but it works for me every time. I press down really hard on the bump, several times a day. Don't mash it with your fingers. Just put your finger on it and push, it's almost like it mashes under the skin and then clears up. Good luck!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this. Crush 1 to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash. More such solutions at <a href="http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/</a>|`|qbnrzyCZaa	If it hurts when you press it it's probably just puss look if there's any yellow spots on that small zit and if there is then just pop it and it'll turn back to regular skin in two days or so until then wear some concealer or foundation to hide the small popped bump. Good Luck :)|`|TsWFLgixaa	First remove the inner ink tube of a pen. Then press the transparent end over the top of the spot and twist from left to right. Hey Presto the pimple pops out. Now place a bag of frozen peas (or anything else cold) over the hole that has been left to make it close up.<br>  You may want to try it now and see if it works, and if you end up getting the pimple do it again.|`|CEEWrIqjaa	I would suggest not touching it! If you can, get a sample of Retin A and rub a little on the area.. this has worked for me. Just don't touch or try to squeeze because it can get infected and inflamed and you don't want that...If that does happen, I suggest going to the derm and getting a benzoyl peroxide shot in the pimple, it reduces the size and goes away quickly!|`|c03e3e8b621829924bbadbc4c5c146adaa	wipe it with hydrogen peroxide|`|WUhE9Vi0aa	Wash your face and nose really well.

There's a goo chance it could be infected if you did it using an unsterile needle. Wash it with antibiotic dial soap & clean with hydrogen peroxide. It will probably bubble because there may be some infection. If it get's really gross, take it out, let it heal & get it done prefessionally. It's only like 60 bucks where I live.

If you have no artistic abilities and you dress "artistic", all that will happen is they realize you aren't who you pretend to be. <br>  <br>  Here's an idea. Focus on learning how to do something, not trying to look like you're something. Plus, clothes and makeup don't do much. How much do you judge other people by what they wear?

RKbxxjJuaa	The best thing for oily hair is to mix baking soda, about two tablespoons for long hair, (I use about that much and my hair is 1/2 way down my back and THICK!) with about a silver dollar size blob of your shampoo.  Don't premix it!  Pour the shampoo in your hand then add the baking soda then apply!  It works better than any salon product, and you can add it to really cheap shampoo, so it won't break the bank!  I actually keep a box of baking soda in my shower caddy!  Regarding your breakouts try using baby wash.  It's milder so it doesn't strip your skin of all the natural oils which in turns encourages your skin to produce more oil.  I also like Purpose face wash, it's like baby stuff for grown ups, SUPER gentle!|`|iOeMvaWqaa	How about you cut your hair? I can't stand really long hair on guys but a little shag is cute ;-)|`|EIqfBWNsaa	If you have oily skin, you shouldn't be using a cream wash... it will add more oil. You need a gel or foam that's specifically meant for oily skin. As for your hair, use a shampoo/conditioner for oily hair. If it's really bad, shampoo it daily (it dries it out)... and you can try sprinkling some baby powder like on your part and rubbing it in. It works well. Good luck.

fDWaM4XCaa	The waist is probably big. Wear a belt or take them to a tailor.|`|q8bJzyUaaa	agree with answer 1|`|r2QIbmPIaa	Same problem. I wore those today and they fit good everywhere else(actually a little bit on the tighter side) but i wore a belt after going through the same problem as you and now they don't slide down as much.

PefglUNaaa	just do it. guys hair grows back way fast. imagine yourself with it.|`|4NI6QDDuaa	if you have fotoshop then you could. you should cut it though, worst thing, you don't like it and it grows back!|`|IKpwMXTlaa	try looking for an online site where you can upload a pic of yourself and change the hair. i think you can do it at seventeenmag.com<br>  oh your a guy. my bad haha. most guys look better with short hair -but not a buzz! dont shave it all off! your hair will grow fast though. just do it.|`|OfZFVI2xaa	i'd say don't cut it.<br>  as long as you wash it and it's not greasy<br>  and you actually have a nice cut the ladies will love it. =)<br>  be individual! =D
Z2uYisnAaa	I think it sounds fine as long as you're not going overboard on the foundation. =)|`|joiacDUdaa	That doesn't sound too bad.. If you have decent skin you could skip the powdered foundation and use a tinted moisturizer with SPF... I would also wear a blush or something on the cheek.. Something natural looking to give you some color.  Maybe a swipe of neutral eye shadow.  That would be ok for a 14 yr. old.  I'm WAY older and use a tinted moisturizer it has a lighter feel on the skin and looks more natural...|`|Pl7J5HFMaa	Thats perfect for your age. but if you wanted to you can wear some eyeliner.|`|mf2dnQA5aa	I'm two years younger and I wear all that but not the powder foundation, I use liquid. I also wear liquid make-up, eyeliner, eye shadow, ad actually almost any color lip gloss and I use a ton of chap stick. No one calls me a **** or anything and my mom likes it and so does my little sister.|`|a6z2SKr0aa	yeah everything pretty good for 14. Thats wat i used. You should use darker colored lip gloss from avon. its really nice its not too dramatic either. This is not too much. Its good. But give ur skin a break sometime all that makeup isn't needed 4 everyday use.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|6M2ikJfkaa	I think it's fine. You might not need the concealer if you have the foundation, and vice versa.|`|fkuKHXqJaa	I think at 14 a little lip gloss and mascara should do the trick. Maybe a little concealer if you have acne|`|c0fded412e2f6885dbe299e7d76531f3aa	I think maybe the powder foundation might be heavier makeup than a 14 year old should wear but mascara and lip gloss are perfect.  Concealer is good at any age!|`|GzDUVMYEaa	im 14 and i wear all of that ... and sumtimes eye showdow if im going out to a party. but thats fine. i wear miniral foundation.. better for your skin|`|9RA7mPYBaa	you don't need anyhing beyond mascara and lipgloss.|`|mY0sSIQDaa	No that sounds just fine.|`|IvIatEg3aa	That's not too much|`|7KfbWBNpaa	no its not to much at all :) x
s63bm0Guaa	Hi there.<br>  It all really depends on what you have going on already. and how your skin tones are, and how your actual skin is, face shape, etc.. Also depends on your personal style. and makeup.  Talk to your regular stylist and they will be able to point you in the right direction . <br>  Generally as you get older though....your hair, skin  and eyes start to lighten, therefor lightening the color of your hair gradually over time will help to keep you looking your best.  Just keep in mind that when you turn 60, your hair wont be as dark (even though there may be little grey and it mostly might be all your natural) as what it was when you were 30.<br>  A lot of people make the mistake of coloring their hair to what it was when they were really young (if they were naturally brunettes), and that really ages people.|`|GOSMZMpwaa	Bangs and long hair. Make you look really young since it is in style right now. Keeping up with the current  trends and not wearing MOM JEANS would make you automatically look younger. :)  Kind of personal but a good bra helps to when someones boobs are down to their belly button they look old lol no offense? <br>  <br>  Good Luck !! :D

KJCw5BaZaa	YES, you tan through sunscreen. I always wear sunscreen and end up black by the end of the summer. The only thing that sunscreen hinders are harmful UV rays damaging your skin. You'll most certainly still tan, even if you put it on before you go the tanning bed (which you should always).|`|TZBrjuwkaa	i don't know about the zinc oxide but the sunscreen yes you can on a lower level and a higher level it depend on your skin type.

But, my mom told me that chances are, I would regret it. I kept begging and told her that I wouldn't regret it. But she still wouldn't let me.

Plus, if you dye it, eventually it will come back in the old color and hen you have to dye it again. . . and for the rest of your life.|`|TZu1bixraa	firstly exploring your identity is done by trying different looks and finding your personal style...  <br>  <br>  tell her you wont mess up your hair as long as youre not using bleach. a semi-permanant  (or even temporary)  colour a few shades above or below your own will just add some depth or make it a bit more vibrant version of its natural colour. <br>  <br>  These days most people have some colour in their hair, it doesnt necesarily have to be obvous, you can just enhance your natural colour!<br>  <br>  lastly dont argue with her, talk to her as a grown up, as im sure thats why she doesnt want you to start dying your hair- shes probably scared seeing you start to grow up. show her you are maturing and she'll have to accept that hair dye or not you arent a little girl anymore xxx good luck xxx|`|bGyVJ6meaa	Scream "I HATE YOU MUM YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME!!!", then spin round, pouting as you do so, loudly stomp up the stairs and then slam your bedroom door behind you. <br>  <br>  If you feel you are able, some tears in eyes may help.|`|7obNke84aa	I don't really like highlights either but it's a little extreme to say it's going to lead to pregnancy and boys! Tell her you need to find out who you really are and that these little changes are going to help you find the answer to your question. Maybe you can make your dad put in a little more input too. Hopefully your mom will calm down a little, it's not that big of a deal. Good luck!|`|YvCPfoq5aa	Defecate in a canelope.

Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom. <br>  - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony.

Cb449Dweaa	The best way to remove facial/body hair is Waxing. Shaving stimulates hair growth so it grows back faster and faster each time you shave, plus the razor cuts the hair off at the surface of the skin leaving it blunt and course. Dipilatories only remove hair at the the skins surface an can cause skin irratation as well.<br>   Allow at least 2 or 3 weeks hair growth before you wax for the first time. Each time you wax it takes longer and longer for the hair to grow back  and the re-growth will be much softer and thinner and eventually the hair will stop growing back all together. You can only rip a hair out  from the bulb so many times before it kills the "mother papilla" and no longer produces a hair. That's why you see older ladies with penciled on eyebrows... they  plucked the hair out from the bulb over and over again,  so many times,  the hair does not grow back.|`|SsHNOtAGaa	well, that smooth away doesn't work at all, in case you're wondering.<br>  Nair works quite well. [:|`|Yb24E1KBaa	waxing...|`|FaanLkfSaa	There are alot of ways to remove Body and Facial Hair...<br>  Shaving- Grows back in a couple of days a bit thicker everytime.

(I had threading done for the peach fuzz on my face, but body hair I would reccomend waxing!)<br>  Good Luck!|`|QOWPdl2qaa	There are many ways.<br>  If your looking for something that will keep the hair away for a while, try waxing.

SXm75cZtaa	Eye makeup. The trick with eye makeup is putting on a neutral base ? either taupe, beige, light brown or ivory ? over the lid before applying any color. After the base is in place, accent color using shadows and eyeliners should then be applied to define the eyes. The accent color should match or be complementary to the color of your eyes. Afterwards, cap your eye makeup with mascara. <br>  <br>  For women with green eyes, greens and plums for accent colors and plum for the mascara<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Lip colors. The best lipstick to use for our lips depends, again, on the tone of our skin. You may also want to pick a lipstick for daytime use and another one for nighttime use. To further define the lips, apply a lip liner that matches the color of your lipstick. Lip liners also help keep the color of the lips from bleeding. Another tip to try is to use a lip brush instead of applying the lipstick directly on the lips. This would keep the lipstick from smearing and the color from bleeding as well. <br>  <br>  Lipsticks with gold, pink with a touch of gold, peach and light to medium brown best complement olive-skinned women(if you are medium you are olive)<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Blushers. Moderation is the key to the perfect application of blushers to the cheeks. Blushers are meant to give the face a natural healthy color, and too much can look gaudy and artificial. Again, skin tone should be taken into consideration when choosing a shade for the blusher. <br>  <br>  Women with olive skin tones would do well with bronze, apricot and light pink. <br>  <br>  I really hope this helped. <br>  I put a link below to a website that will help you if you have more questions[:|`|NC0tSeFSaa	mascara:<br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=exact_eyelights_waterproof" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  (black ruby]<br>  <br>  eye shado:<br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=eye_enhancers_1_kit_shadows" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  (sterling blue]<br>  <br>  eyeliner:<br>  <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/products/Zero247.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandecay.com/products/Zero2...</a> <br>  (zero]<br>  or<br>  <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/products/Flipside247.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandecay.com/products/Flips...</a><br>  (flipside]|`|BAPj9JW3aa	for some reason, brown/neutral eyeshadows look really good with green eyes! i guess the nude colors don't draw attention AWAY from the eye color....line your eyes with brown or black eyeliner pencil and use an apricot colored blush. oh and mascara, mascara, mascara OF COURSE.|`|e0848503e661b7bce4423b6ccc3b1360aa	Neutrals are the best for green eyes, if you'd like to buy some I have an Avon store you can browse, I also have great cleaners and toners visit this site <a href="http://ochandler.avonrepresentative.com/." rel="nofollow">http://ochandler.avonrepresentative.com/...</a> Email me for any questions.<br>  punkerjune@yahoo.com|`|gsem4EnYaa	hmmm LUCKY, i wish i had green eyes = (<br>  sorry im a guy no clue about makeup = )

Most brands make these, including MAC, Lancome, Rimmel, Neutrogena and Almay. But if you don't happen to have any of that on hand, you can always use a lightweight moisturizer like Cetaphil, and then wipe it away with a towel. It lifts off the makeup, but you must be careful to avoid getting any of it in your eyes. It also helps to wash your face twice after removing makeup, to get rid of any leftover trace amounts of product.|`|d8LyjT8Xaa	I like to use Neutrogina make up remover. You wet your face with your hands close your eyes, pump some out on your hand and scrub it wherever you need your make-up removed.

It also makes your skin really soft because it has a cleanser in it too.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	Vaseoline..works for eyeliner.|`|SXm75cZtaa	take a sensitive lotion for your face.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	You'd be surprised that many products on the market are for all hair types - unless it states otherwise. The oils are not really moisturizers, they are sealants; they should be used to seal in the moisture. After you use a daily moisturizer on her hair then rub some natural oil in it and this will seal in the daily moisturizer so her hair can stay moisturized all day. <br>  <br>  The only way to see if this product works is to try it.

The wider crotch and roomier front are essential (large package) for comfort and fit. The nylon feels great (my lady really likes how they feel on me). The extra fabric in front allows room for anything that may come up. My tendencies are for the panties only and I don't wear the tops. However, if a fellow is so inclined, they look okay.<br>  To fully appreciate the support given, one should see them on a model.|`|Nsw0mJBNaa	I think you should be able to wear whatever clothes you want that make you feel comfortable. Period.<br>  That is what I do. SO now I do not care for the fashions, but some do. I wear women's panties and lingerie. To some I know they think the\at is just weird. but what does it matter to them anyways. I also moisturize and take care of myself. It makes me a whole person that I am happy with.

But then I wear womens panties and lingerie as often as I can.  There's nothing like something soft, lacy, and feminine under your male clothes to help get you through your day!  You have to look a little bit, but there are panties out there that can be a good fit for guys and very comfortable to wear, especially if the size of your package is on the smaller side.|`|CADaAIHIaa	As a crossdresser I personally prefer to dress in women's undies.

ssYUtrQ1aa	My fiance' takes Biotin, and she is fairly happy with it. It makes her hair a little bit thicker and makes it grow faster. Her fingernails grow stronger too.

I was a photographer for 3 1/2 years and sometimes you hear people talking about models like they are livestock.

Sneakers (no sandals, as they will cause blisters and will hurt by the end of the night.  Take a pair of jeans and maybe hoodie as may nights in PA are cooler.  (I live right between Erie and Pittsburgh).  <br>  <br>  As for your fear of the Phantom, have one of your friends or whoever is going with you go on too.  Joke about it and make light fun of the ride.  That's what I do when I encounter a ride that I don't know about.  <br>  <br>  Can I come too?

I'm guessing that is in America though (apologies if not) as I live in the UK!<br>  <br>  As for what to wear, I don't know what the weather is like where you are but denim is always good -- whether it be jeans or shorts. Try teaming it with a cute t-shirt and some comfy footwear as you will probably be walking around a hell of a lot - plus I don't know what it is like over there but in england if you are wearing sandals or flip flops that are likely to come off on the ride, they make you take them off!<br>  <br>  As for your fear, I can't help you there I am afraid! I am petrified of scary rides!!!<br>  <br>  Have a brilliant day!<br>  xxx|`|45F6fWlnaa	ok to get over your fear, try going on some smaller rides first. and ask yourself honestly whats the worst that could happen? and then ask yourself how often does that happen and remember that the rides are tested every morning to be sure that they are running properly. <br>  <br>  as for your outfit try some denim shorts, nothing too short or else your legs will stick to the seat and its only in may so its not that warm. And try layer some tank tops, like the thicker straped kind, and nothing too low cut you dont want a peek-a-boob situation especially seeing as most of the rides take your picture.|`|6948f3039e33d7db233f94fb4c118e0aaa	i have never been to kenny wood park but i have heard of it what i do on scary rides like that i just close my eyes for the whole ride and if i feel nautious i eat ice cream and it calms me down <br>  <br>                   GOOD LUCK!|`|8vIFr5Asaa	something cute and practicle.<br>  <br>  cute tee shirt or tank top.<br>  bermuda shorts or capri pants.<br>  sneakers.<br>  hair simple, down or in a ponytail.<br>  if its cold that day, bring a sweatshirt.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|NoMajXUCaa	to conquer your fear----- just pretend its any old baby ride and then youll forget all about the ride being scary.. trust me..<br>  <br>  <br>  and wear denim shorts, a tee and some flip flops or something that will stay on ur feet if u want<br>  <br>  hope i helped!!|`|Sv4E2o6uaa	shorts not the short ones but the bermuda stripped ones with a shirt and a jacket it u get cols it can still be cold in may|`|4m6vetjNaa	I Have No Idea What Youre Talking About
d8EYaNw2aa	Hi I have been to kennywood during may and i would say the second outfit because you would look to dressed up in the first one but if you plan to get wet i say bring soffees and a tee with a bathing suit then change into that outfit and don't wear jeans you will get so hot and wear flip flops becuse it is not to hard to walk in them just make sure to break them in before you go have fun!|`|yOudAHDfaa	um, either is fine you have really good taste, but they might get dirty since it is an amusement park and don't wear any kind of flip-flops because your feat will hurt so I would wear small tan or white sneakers because you don't want them to be bulky or hot. Get beige all stars they look great with anything not hight tops the small ankle ones<br>  <br>  Have fun!!|`|cGKDJaqpaa	you should wear jeans- either black or light wash, and vans. not flip flops (expeccially, like, at six flags kinds of places because you'll have to take flip flops off). wear like a tank top/tshirt. i'm not a fan of shorts at amusement parks.

s4q8M2fAaa	there is a certain level of pain for all tattoos, however, the pain differs from each place on your body. Certain area's are more sensitive than others, such as the ribs, sternum, underarm, inner elbow, etc.<br>  it also depends on your personal pain tolerance and how willing you are to sit for long periods of time through pain.|`|t4BpFdmdaa	pooooooooooooey bad!|`|Z5qAbw12aa	not much..i heard......i never had one lol|`|g3IXprk9aa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  All tattoos will hurt. Some people say they don't hurt, but that's not all true. It really depends on how well you can tolerate pain and relax during it. Some people say that it feels like you have sunburn and something is deeply scratching you, or a burning sensation. Everyone differs. Spots that are more bone tend to hurt more. For example, head, face, neck, ribs, sternum, butt, feet, hands, parts on the spine. These spots are known to cause discomfort when getting tattooed but like I said, if it's something you truly want and you can tolerate pain well then it won't be too hard for you. The people that say tattoos don't hurt. maybe they have gotten something small, or just sat through getting the tattoo well. My boyfriend and myself are pretty much covered in tattoos. We've gotten tattooed in some pretty painful spots, but they are tolerable. If they weren't, people wouldn't get them. All the best! :-)|`|I2wPn0Zlaa	they hurt...but it a pleasure kind of hurt ya know?<br>  I have 2 by the way and i am def getting more|`|LMWFnodfaa	depends on your pain threshold. mine hurt pretty bad.<br>  <br>  ??|`|WKgm9qTkaa	Depends on your pain tolerance, where your getting it done, and the design. Everyone has a different experience, and every place on your body feels different due to sensitivity. If its your first tattoo and you have a low pain tolerance you might want to stay away from places like the neck, back, under arms or chest. The more fat and muscle you have the better, places that are bony will hurt much more. Outlining isn't too bad, but coloring can hurt more because they go over the same area again and again. Half my arm is done up in a sleeve, and each time I go it seems to be more tolerable. Its fine on the outside of my arm, but when he goes under, its pretty painful. <br>  <br>  Its definitely worth the experience, the pain is nothing compared to having an amazing work of art on your skin forever, and you will be so glad you did it in the end. Good luck.|`|sOgIFkHbaa	Well they hurt!  Whoever says they dont is lying!  I have my husbands initials on my ring finger, and even though it was quick, I like to describe the feeling as, a piece of hot glass cuting through your skin!  <br>  <br>  I have also read that the most painful parts on your body to get tattoos are as follows:<br>   Rib cage<br>  Behind the ear<br>  Ankel<br>  Foot<br>  Neck<br>  Back of neck<br>  colarbone<br>  <br>   basically anywhere where you tend to have hardley any fat.  This part of the body is more sensetive to the pain.|`|k23GYs9iaa	it will depend on what area of the body you get it. places like your shoulder blade and upper arm wont hurt much. i barley felt if it just feels like someone is drawing on you With a fine point pen<br>   other places like the lower back and the foot and face/ neck area will hurt more because the skin is thinner and there are more nerve endings. hope this helps.
6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	You can cover them, but those scars are there for ever..unless you go to a dermatologist  and get  a procedure done called dermabrasion....the real kind of dermabrasion, not the products in a box out on the market they have. They are different types of dermabrasion used by skin doctors to rid the skin of acne scars. Bottom line, stop popping those blemishes, it is harmful to your skin, There is a product called "Dermablend" sold in the dept stores for scars, and other skin flaws, if regular concealer does not do the trick.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Vitamin E  prevents acne or pimple scarring and can also be used  to fade old scars.

Scar cream, depending on where you go their should be some scar creams at most stores.<br>  <br>  3. I've heard tomato help, personally never tried it. Drinking water does though.<br>  <br>  4. Most fade with time, you could wait it out. I wouldn't blame you if you tossed that option out the window.<br>  <br>  5. Talk to your dermatologist about getting the marks removed. It will probably be pricey. <br>  <br>  I'm 16, I know what its like to stare at a pimple and cant help but to pick at it. Nasty little things arn't they?

As for location, think of your design first because some art just doesn't work on certain parts. <br>  <br>  Also, a really good tattooist can usually help take your ideas and create something unique.

AA10011909	it's actually really simple. get three shades of the same color, whichever you want. for blue eyes, browns, golds and greys look really nice for a smoky eye.<br>  <br>  apply the darkest one from your lashline up to the crease of your eye.  then use the medium shade and sweep it directly into your crease. it's okay if it looks at little messy at first.  then use the lightest shade to clean it up a little; apply it from where the medium color ended up to your browbone. dont use too much eyeshadow, this is supposed to just highlight your eyes.  you can lightly sweep the lightest shade down around the inside corner of your eye near your tear ducts and a little under it to open your eyes a bit more.<br>  <br>  then use your eyeliner and smudge it into your lashline. finish it off with two coats of mascara and youre done!<br>  <br>  you can use a little loose powder to clean up under your eyes in case you accidentally got flakes of the eyeshadow on your skin when you were applying it. have fun! :]|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	All you need is a black eyeshadow and a creamy black eyeliner.

You can also mix it with a white SPF for sun protection as well.... Good luck

1A9TdN4yaa	Try a lotion and a shampoo called Ziravie, which combines tradition, science and nature to provide a mixture of natural nutrients, minerals and vitamins, which act on the scalp in depth, that in turn stimulates strong, healthy, robust hair growth, strengthening hair roots, gives volume and reduces thinning , hair loss and baldness. plus check their website which gives a combination  of fruits and vegetables that  helps to strengthen the hair roots internally.<br>  The lotion that I use helps to accelerate hair growth but it is a a process first it calms the scalp, itching reduces, then with discipline use hair fall stops, within 3 weeks of use the hair roots strengthens and you start to see volume and silkiness<br>  The website is www.ziravie.com but I bought it in Spain and now it is available on ebay.co.uk

sOgIFkHbaa	I personally have tried both and I preffer Proactive.  I was using that brand for years, but you do have to be careful because you can over dry your skin, and it becomes flaky and it burns really bad.  I would recommend buying along with the kit, the oil free mostirizer.  But if you really have a bad case of acne, you should consider seeing your dermetologist.  Sometimes they are abel to prescribe something that will better suit your needs.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4UXJoMbKaa	While Proactiv is the same product for everyone, SkinID is personalized for your skin type, so go with SkinID. You will get better results, because it pinpoints your specific problems. With Proactiv, it may not treat a certain factor of acne you have. or be treating a factor you don't have. And why would you treat something you don't need to? It's counter intuitive. <br>  <br>  :)|`|7qNJg8DTaa	pro active|`|9vobAEPJaa	Here is my advice as a skin care professional. If you are going to spend the money and you really want improvement in your skin, use the BioElements acne line. It's pricey but well worth it if you are considered about the HEALTH of your skin as well as it's appearance. In school, we did a proactive study and found that yes, it is a wonderful tool for improving your skins appearance but it is actually making the health of your skin deteriorate. The way it works is to seal off your skin, trapping bacteria beneath the surface. Therefore if you discontinue its use, It will make you break out worse. I have not done any research on skinID but I will say that proffesional products are regulated and have much higher success rates. A word of advice, get some light chem peels or microdermabrasion, and always use a moisturizer. Though your skin may look oily, its NEEDS the moisture.|`|e0848503e661b7bce4423b6ccc3b1360aa	I have an avon store that sells Cleansers, and scrubs that are much cheaper!!

You may not get clear skin in a week, but they're are long term effects. You'll have awesome skin in like 2 months. I recommend Differin! As for a cleanser, use cetphil. If you need to, an antibiotic is wonderful. It'll help so much!
q549d4Obaa	you already got the right idea. but when it comes to exercising make you wash yourself when your down. all that sweat isn't going to help. and make sure you don't over wash either. you'll wash off oils that keep your skin moist and by washing them off you're skin will dry out and which would be counter productive. but yeah, it pumps out toxins and stuff so it's good. and don't touch your face.|`|4UXJoMbKaa	Basically, any fruit or veggie will help you clear up. Things with deep pigmentation are the most helpful, because they contain the most antioxidants. Apples are a must, they work wonders for acne. If you stick to a diet of mostly fruits and veggies, occasionally lean meat, and very little dairy, you will benefit your skin greatly. Running is also a good idea. Your whole body will be healthy, and that reflects your skin. It promotes healthy circulation and sweating will help clear pores. 2 miles is a good distance, not too much, not too little. A happy medium :)
iYL37RfPaa	hmmm the only thing i can think of<br>  that will work really fast is just makeup,<br>  like a really light foundation and powder,<br>  <br>  sorry if i didn't help!!<br>  <br>  xo|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Ask Michael Jackson.|`|evFgc1bcaa	I'm in the same situation as you are.<br>  I haven't actually tried it, but I heard lemon juice helps reduce your natural tone. Make sure to use a moisturizer though. Lemon juice will dry up your skin :]|`|5aa6c255769d2581cd3da1bfae8f73bbaa	I don't believe there is any such way to make your skin white in safe manner.<br>  <br>  I think just make-up or cover-up would be the best and safest way to achieve your desired results.
FqNMW6yuaa	Goats? That's frickin awesome! ; )<br>  Anyways, the projector sounds great, and for my thirteenth birthday a few years ago we did a spa sort of thing, which was great.<br>  You just need some facial masks (you can make these with the friends out of kitchen items which can be very fun) a BUNCH of nail polish and such.<br>  Or (Oooh this would be fun) have a goat baby shower sort of thing. There are a ton of fun games to play at a baby shower like mashing up different candy bars and putting them in diapers and then guessing what they are. (This can be quite hilarious)<br>  I don't know. Just have fun. 13th birthdays are awesome, such a fun age!|`|GSEslPnTaa	Why don't you invite your friends over and give each other manicures, pedicures, facials, and read gossip magazines, and then after that maybe make some ice cream sundaes and pop in some good girly movies and pull an all nighter talking about boys and gossiping (:|`|LoBNxHrtaa	well for my 13th b-day last year i had no idea what to do, but i chose to just invite a few friends ova and have a sleepover.

But you could make your own spa things, and make little cookies to eat while you are doing this. Paint your nails, and do facials and stuff like that, and have lots of snacks and movies and stuff like that. You could print off different make up ideas, and hair ideas, and have everyone bring make up that they have and take turns trying out different things.|`|37cgfJOaaa	Movies:<br>  Mean Girls<br>  Sleepover<br>  Bring It On, Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3, Bring it On 4<br>  <br>  Games:<br>  Would you rather?<br>  Truth or Dare?<br>  <br>  Food/Snacks:<br>  Chips<br>  Pop<br>  Candy<br>  Popcorn<br>  (any junk)<br>  <br>  If you think this is fun you could do this, Hotel. You lead your guests to where they will stay (have them sign in first), then you have them choose what they would like for dinner (have a parent deliver, like room service), give them 3-4 choices. Do the same for breakfast. Before they come set up the area you will be sleeping, to look like a hotel room. Do other things, like a hotel. Have a spa thing, like facials, manicures and pedicures, massages. Have parents and siblings help out with the night.<br>  <br>  NO GOATS!!|`|EgXdErkvaa	Movie Ideas: <br>  <br>  1.

To bad there's no guys 'cause you could have played 7 minutes in Heaven! <br>  <br>  3. You could have  a Sleepover? And Talk all night ;P<br>  4. A Cool Activity that i did at my 13 party 2 years ago is that you go to the mall and do a Scavenger Hunt : Prepare the night before by going to the mall to find or think of things for the hunt.   i.e.:  number of stairs, escalators, things in shop windows, lost receipt, etc.  The day of the party give each team a list of the items and within a specified amount of time see who comes up with the correct answers/items.<br>  Party Favor / Game:  Give each person $5.00 and see how many items they can purchase in a limited amount of time.<br>  Hit the pizza parlor (or other) afterwards! Its pretty fun!..<br>  <br>  5.Hotel Party:<br>  Get a two bedroom hotel room.  One for the kids and one for the parents.  Make sure it has all the amenities like pool and game room.   Bring lots of popcorn, sodas, videos, etc (or if you prefer room service).   Let the maids clean up the mess the next day.<br>  <br>  6.Beauty Salon:<br>  Take the girls to a beauty salon to have their hair and nails done.  Or do up their hair and nails at home in conjunction with a slumber party.  For an activity, decorate pillow cases.  Purchase one plain white case for each girl.<br>  <br>  7.Murder:<br>  Prepare slips of paper, enough for each player.  All will be blank except two.   One will be marked "Murderer" and the other "Detective".   Let the players pick no one can say who they are.  To play, turn out the lights and have everyone mill around.  The Murderer must "strike" one person and they should go down.  This "Victim" cries out and the lights are turned back on.  Everyone then freezes.  The detective then must determine who the killer was by asking questions.  Everyone MUST tell the truth except the Murderer, who may lie as much as they want.<br>  <br>  8.Spring Snowball Fight (outside activity!)<br>  Materials:  Plenty of panty hose, preferably white (local $ store is a great resource) I think one pair will make about 10 "snowballs".   25lbs+  flour<br>  Directions:  Put a cup or so of flour into the leg of hose.  Tie off as close as possible to the top of the flour.  Cut the hose above the knot.   You now have your first "snow ball"  Try it!! Continue by tying, filling, tying, cutting.   It's a bit of prep work - but worth it!  The "snowballs" last a long time! <br>  Warning:  Be prepared for a mess!  White will be all over everything in your yard!  Use a leaf-blower to dust off the kids.  Get as much as you can cleaned up before it rains.   The memory is worth the mess!<br>  <br>  Food/Snakes:<br>  <br>  1.

It won't last.|`|j8i4kSEDaa	I have just started out my modeling carrear in Texas and soon will be one of the frontline models for a jean company that does custom jobs. <br>  <br>  One of the first things you need to know as a model, is that you need to be confident, and getting paid jobs won't be easy at first, and most likely you won't be ending up on the paris runway. I honestly started it because I was bored over winter break and wanted something to do. <br>  <br>  first look on wanted ads around your area for photographers wanting to do a TFCD. Which is a Time For CD (of the images). You will have to do SEVERAL of these. But this way you will learn what it takes to be a model and if you can handle the annoyance of holding a very uncomfortable pose for massive amounts of time. You need to be creative, flexible and friendly towards the people you're working with. Never act like you're the star, or it's all about you, because it's atcually all about the photographer and what he/she wants. Put up a portfolio of yourself on a website like modelmayhem.com make sure your portfolio only has professional pictures, and not only pictures you took of yourself. <br>  <br>  Eventually once you do alot of TFCD, and if you're good, somebody will discover you though model mayhem, or offer you a paid job though modeling. it takes patience, and in the begenning you're going to spend alot of money on clothing that the photographers want you to have for free shoots. <br>  <br>  My advice, start out with black pump high heels, and go from there. Good luck.|`|JbeuWHG1aa	Are you 5'10" or taller?  Most models are around 6'.  Be aware of all the scams out there that will take your money.  You will need a portfolio of pictures with different outfits and poses.  You will need to find a reputable agency, i.e. Fords, NYC. & interview.  Call them for advice.  So many models get in over their head and use drugs; are you mature?  Don't go to foreign countries without a chaperon as you could be sold into a sex slave trade ring & never seen again as some will recruit "models". If you get jobs, save your $ as the career does not last.|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Do not pay anything. <br>  If they ask for money than it's a flop.<br>  Be stong mentally, the modeling industry is very can be very mean and criticizing.<br>  Don't get sucked into all the drugs, and barfing, and starving that comes with it.|`|GSEslPnTaa	Becoming a model takes a lot of work, i am not trying to discourage you but just make sure that this goal is a realistic one for you.....

The style isnt bad but Idk why not try some color? Its prom, have fun!|`|1rjQhUXWaa	The color isnt my first pic, but its really gorgeous! GOOD luck!|`|oMaNnwOQaa	It's okay, but get a darker color. It will compliment your skin.|`|P2EhkEJVaa	a little too fancy for prom....|`|T6OWTQjPaa	i would say a brighter color.|`|7qNJg8DTaa	Its pretty! :)|`|X52KmH3baa	yes|`|55H2DM0Baa	Personally i am not into those kinds of dresses.. but if your planning on wearing it to prom be prepared to see a bunch of people with the same dress cuz the puff puff at the bottom is very common this year. My friend is wanting to wear one also for prom. Except her's is in blue with a white sash... But it really is up to you when your confident and you feel like the Sh#$ then you will glow !!!!|`|45F6fWlnaa	that dress looks much to bridesmaid-esque. And because you have light brown hair and tan skin I dont think you should wear a brown, beige, or tan dress it will make you look like a brownish blob. Try something with a little more color. Even ivory would be better (though make sure it doesnt look to much like a wedding dress)|`|EKoRHgdgaa	Honestly, it is a very pretty dress, but it is too "I am going to a wedding".

You should try for a slimmer dress.<br>  This dress look more like a dress that you would wear for a wedding for a bridesmaid.<br>  Have fun at the prom!!|`|zxzhkIIcaa	omg honestly i love it!<br>  i just wore the same EXACT one for my sisters wedding. <br>  i wore it with some really tall mocha color heels. i got a lot of compliments.<br>  it looked good, im the same complection as you and my hair was brown at the time too.<br>   :)|`|OEqxVXYVaa	girl u r sooooooo making me jelous and trust me its a good thing cause no one makes me jelous <br>  its beautiful and it will go with ur light brown hair and tanish skin!|`|9l4nlmeMaa	i love the style of the dress, but if there was maybe a red or some other bright color, that would work better with your hair and skin tone|`|68eDrOQBaa	It's nice but seeing as your hair is brown and your skin is tanned why not go for something with more of a contrast?|`|cB5hEv07aa	the dress is reallyy pretty and all but i dont think that a brown dress would look good with tan skin.. buut thats justt my opinionn. =)|`|LsZF2wmhaa	I Absolutely Love The Dress But I Think The Color Will Clash With Your Skin Tone.<br>  If You Like Bright Colors A Yellow Dress Would Be Really Cute. <br>  Maybe Even A Deep Purple|`|9jSmmIxfaa	I LOVE it. So cute you will have all eyes on you at prom in that dress!|`|PtXsIjWnaa	its nice, but i wouldnt wear it. id get a cocktail dress or something|`|94Jsiz8haa	CUTE!<br>  But how much money is it?

iYL37RfPaa	mmm david tennant is fit!!<br>  <br>  xo|`|4ASDeXsgaa	.|`|AA12221099	The answer sort of depends on your hair type. If it's straight, like David's then about 6 inches from the middle back of your head and four in the front.|`|1HUXx5Qcaa	;skjdf|`|GOSMZMpwaa	who the french is david tennant?|`|HZKsNwbeaa	You would need a bald head
UikWkS1waa	I lo-lo-love the white one. The red one is cute, too. I don't really like the one Natalie Portman wore at the Oscars. I really like the white one but the red one is REALLY cute, too. Buying online is probably cheaper and quicker. Hope I could help :) Have fun and look pretty!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	It depends on how you look. I'd like the first one in that pink color better but I don't think you should get the white one. Either Natalie Portman or the red in pink. Def get it made.|`|LLk11Ljqaa	i LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the red one!!!<br>  it is so cute<br>  white one is okay but it needs more color to and can get easily stained(sweat)<br>  so I hope you look so pretty at the prom<br>  have fun!!|`|cu8k7tWUaa	I like them all, the first one is pretty, but its a bit too much if you get what I mean?<br>  <br>  Also the second one is very pretty! I love the waist and it would look fantastic, and be brilliant to accessorize<br>  <br>  Although my favourite is the last one, it would be the best to accessorize meaning you would be able to make it your own. Maybe buy some nice silver shoes to match the waist and sequins on the dress and add a shocking pink necklace, bracelet and clutch bag for a original and beautiful take on the dress!!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped<br>  xx|`|zNHjkQsHaa	i love the red one! its so unique. i dont like the idea of copying someone famous but the dress is gorgeous.|`|r8Ulgpvaaa	loove the white one!!! and you should get it made...then its made to fit you and not just hoping it fits while its being shipped in the mail. :)|`|CdGOuEmpaa	uhm.. none. i thought prom dresses were supposed to be long and elegant. homecoming and WPA are the slutty short ones. so yeah, none of them!|`|eQcGoUuKaa	definately the natalie portman one|`|eGTQ98ZBaa	I like the first one but in the pink color. You should get it made then you could have it made into a longer dress. I think it would be really pretty.|`|u6bcyanKaa	the red one i think it will make the biggest statement saying i'm hot and you know it|`|FZDUHFoyaa	i really like the white one!|`|9l4nlmeMaa	the red one is my favorite! it's so pretty
IZZ6T1Ddaa	i have used clinuqe before, and i loved it. it not only made my lips glossy, but it really hydrated them too.<br>  i also really love beauty rush lip gloss. i have many of them my favorite is pink lemonade. they have great flavors and look great too!<br>  really good choices!|`|b3790303c70cd3c142cbc70e455574e8aa	I love Clinique gloss.<br>  You truly can't go wrong with any of Clinique's stuff.
BGnMVMJJaa	try Manic Panic non-permanent hair dye, I used to tie pigtails (about 5) around my head and then dip them in Manic Panic and when you take out the rubberbands the ends are colored perfectly.  Although I had lighter hair, I would think if that didn't work you'd have to lighten the ends to get the desired affect.  sounds cool!|`|4w361g8Laa	There are no herbs or cleaners that will dye your hair purple. You could try food coloring but it probably wont stay or will stain your hair permanently. But really, unless you bleach your hair, a bright color like purple won't show up on your hair.|`|wS3yKXCQaa	Go to sally's they have great stuff!|`|dwlV84IMaa	sorry to say hun but you're gonna have to lighten up those tips if you expect to see any purple at all in them. only because your is hair is dark. think of it like coloring- if you take a purple crayon or marker and try to color on a piece of black paper, it's not going to show up. you'd have to get a lighter piece of paper. meaning you have to at least lighten your tips in order to get any kind of desired result. i've dyed my hair any color you can think of in a thousand different ways and did it all at home. it comes out really great if you know what you're doing or have somebody with you that knows what they're doing. you have to be careful with bleach, though. virgin hair does very well with bleach, but if you've bleached and dyed it once before, you should choose a mid-level bleach so as not to completely kill your hair.<br>  <br>        so pretty much whatever you use, you still need to have a light enough color in your tips to be able to see the purple at all. if you don't want to use any hair dye..umm..maybe you squish up a bunch of blueberries and stain your tips after you bleach them? i personally have not tried that but blueberries are notorious for staining. although it may come out blue and not purple. manic panic color (sold at sally's and possibly hot topic) would be good for you if you don't want the color to stick around for more than a month with all the regular washings. it's in a little tub and is easy to use, so you shouldn't have any problems with it. it wont really damage your hair if you keep up with a deep moisturizing conditioner and don't straighten your hair every single day (heat is terrible for your hair if you don't protect it, literally FRIES it) good luck hun :-)
tB5pveZXaa	I love the American Eagle ones too!<br>  <br>  They, are great quality, really durable, and very adorable. Also, I know that tank tops that I've bought from other places (Gap, Danskin, Sugar Lips etc.) have lost their texture and become loose, making them odd to layer with. These have definitely not done that!<br>  <br>  They are a bit expensive on the website, about $16 dollars, but If you have a Filenes Basement near you, they often sell the American Eagle tanks for $6. That's wear I've bought a few of mine!|`|st5reHVjaa	aerie or american eagle.<br>  kohls (but most have the cami shelf bra)<br>  and target.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	I like Old Navy for basic stuff. It's not thin, but not too thick either. I also love how they come in 45034 different colors. They're really cheap too, only about $4 or so for one. Good luck :)|`|lnlvYEUYaa	rave always has pretty good layering tanks for around $5.00 and they last a while. I have some from 2 years ago.<br>  <br>  if not try those lil asain clothes stores they always have a good variety of layering tanks. i just bought 5 the other day and those were $5.00 too.|`|hWaH6iDMaa	Aeropostale- has good durable really cheap ones<br>  <br>  American Eagle and Aerie (My favorite)- durable not that expensive really cute really good quality!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  :D|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	try target. they usually have cute stuff and it's not too expensive. I have a white one from there and there's no holes! :)|`|r8Ulgpvaaa	i like aerie and american eagle ones. good luck :)|`|rN3gJwg1aa	well i get all mine at eaither abercrombie or hollister because the quality is just alot better and theyre cuter. if you go to hollister theyll be a little cheaper than abercrombie..i just got one at hollister for 10 dollars!|`|scoVqqWDaa	During the summer places like Rave and Rue 21 usually have cheap and colorful tanks- I got a few for $3 a piece last year. And they've lasted me pretty well too.|`|37cgfJOaaa	I have those tanks, spaghetti straps, tons of colors, no cami, long length. I got them at Len Druskan outlet, they were $12.00, at the normal store they are $24.00|`|Z5GbAJrAaa	HOllister&Abercrombie|`|zusHElAYaa	Costco|`|QOWPdl2qaa	Kohl's, Aerie, or Rave Girl are all good.|`|zu1Lw6RUaa	www.topshop.com|`|13BsBvQ1aa	forever 21, target, american eagle, pacsun?
Cu0fPcdnaa	I need a pic ,but i really like guys with big nose it makes you unique.|`|LGidAYDwaa	Not at all. My hubby has a big nose, and most of the guys I've dated in the past did, also. It always depends on the gal. Any gal who gets turned off *just* because you have a big nose isn't good enough for you, anyway.|`|d637920478d83ad0f9d926d44957daf6aa	I dont have a problem with that at all. I am a teeth person. besides i have a "big" nose and my boyfriend has an italian nose and i love it, i think its hot. im sure its not as big to everyone else as it is to you. i know how you feel though, but dont worry, im sure you are fine.|`|gXBPLitzaa	Well ive been wit guys whos noses were a bit big.<br>  Its not a turn on thats for sure but its not that big of a deal anyways.|`|ZV0iipJmaa	yes|`|7fsqT04Iaa	it depends, i would have to see a pic|`|T497f0iwaa	No, it's not a turn-off.  Usually a strong nose looks kind of good on a man.    I can't remember a time I saw a man's nose and thought it was "too big."  I CAN remember many times I have seen weird nose-jobs on guys, and thought they were NOT sexy.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure your nose looks O.K.!!|`|GSEslPnTaa	honestly, personally, yes. <br>  but its not all about looks, as long as you have a good out going personality you'll be fine, and dont let that hold you back from approaching a girl.|`|U3abIK7Zaa	In pictures it is usually a turn off because it makes it look weird.<br>  <br>  In person i think it is a big turn on. i think it is cute and sexy.|`|r8Ulgpvaaa	nope...most girls base theyre jusdgement on personality not just looks. :)|`|5gTk6qzVaa	depends|`|ZTXRF7fuaa	Some guys with big noses are really sexy. <br>  <br>  depends on how you use it...|`|kc6XVl2Iaa	nope. not at all. i dont even look at ppls noses.|`|d8O8b1Iyaa	uhmm... depends how big it is. picture??|`|S6hHyOCYaa	I personally don't mind a guy having a large nose as long as he has enough hair to compensate it. There are a few actors that have larger noses, such as Adrien Brody, who I believe are just as handsome as the next. So don't worry if you have a big nose, as long as you are a nice person to be around the right girl will come around. Good luck!|`|rN3gJwg1aa	if the rest of you is good-looking it probably wont make a huge impact, but otherwise if its huge like you say..probably|`|R1cZV8JHaa	some girls will find it sexy and other will find it ugly depends.|`|fN12Hx0zaa	I  like big noses ha ha.

qksvRJIyaa	This product from Merle Norman came highly recommended. It's an AHA and it continually exfoliates your skin while wearing it. It is 50.00 for a bottle but mine has lasted 2 and a half months now and after a month I was getting compliments on my complexion. People said I looked glowy and asked what I've been doing.

Plus they have a new line called FC5 that does not have anti-aging but what they call cell lock! It would be a great place to start and just use some of the anti-aging line! I use the FC5 line then the anti-aging eye cream!  I am 30 will be 31 in less then a month! The FC5 is about $100 retail and it should last 4-6 months!

I absolutely love fashion so lets see for school im thinking skinny jeans or straight leg jeans a fade wash blue not to tight the relax fi.t a V neck shirt i'd say white or gary with a blazer(black gray white nave blue). Blazers are really in right now. Hats are also in maybe a beanie, or a fedora. Umm for scarfs i would defiantly if you want to look awesome were if all messy make knots and tuck in a blazer that's in right now or if you want to look really laid back you get a hoodie and wear a blazer over it that looks awesome. Or if you don't like blazers cardigans always do the trick as in for shoes i'd say gladiators to go for these outfits but it is cold so maybe some vans.

zXHNSohTaa	Sadly, I don't think Palmer's really works. I tried it with no results, and when I saw doctor, they confirmed that there's no medical trials that support cocoa butter as having any real effect on scars. And I would beware because it might just clog your pores and make more acne. I still use Palmers cuz I love the chocolately smell, but just for my body now.<br>  <br>  I had red marks from acne and the only thing has been fading it is a retinoid like retin-a or differin which will create cell turnover. Or some kind of exfoliation to get rid of older layers of skin carrying the red spots. If you have the kind that leave uneven pitting, my doctor says only dermal injections can help with those.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Yes. They won't just take a year.

This medicine really works.|`|6VDnxjhDaa	Use Bio-Oil about $10 at walgreens or CVS, see the before and after pic on google. <br>  I used it to prevent stretch marks in my pregnancy, and though I got a few ones, I think they could have been worse. <br>  Hope this helps|`|O6q1ygsAaa	It depends on how much you put on, i have never actually used it, but prescription might help

vDky5V15aa	Piercings aren't my thing, so I don't have any. But aesthetically,  I think the lip stud is prettier. Plus, it can be more easily removed for a job. One must consider career ramifications when choosing body mods. I am heavily tattooed, but if I were wearing a suit, or even a button up shirt, no one would know. <br>  <br>  My art is my business and I only put it on display when it's appropriate.  <br>  <br>  Just something to consider. Good luck.|`|brvOa9QYaa	stud on both  x|`|UZldkMgRaa	Overall I think both guys and Girls look better with studs,<br>  but It depends if your lips are smaller, then hoops would probably be more flattering to draw attention to you lips.<br>  When I had my lip pierced I wore a stud because I just don't care for hoops,<br>  but when you have snake bites I think you can Kind of go either way.<br>  ohhh, and For hoops, they look better in a smaller gauge like a 16g or even 18g rather than like a 14g or bigger....<br>  Good luck!<br>  and Snake bites are definatly attractive if you have the right face for them.....|`|AA11988490	neither.<br>  stop piercing yourself. and if you are gonna do it, do it for yourself not for what people on answers tell you looks attractive.|`|MkchPOjFaa	well i got the middle og my bottom lip pierced i have a stud...its cute but if i had it on the side id prolly get the hoop there cute =]|`|quHnUWyWaa	the hoop is easier to take care of until healed, after that you choose right now i have a horseshoe on my lip|`|NRWtiKhZaa	NEITHER|`|hQnN2aZKaa	snakebites!<br>  xD<br>  they look better on the bottom.|`|XYRoXa7iaa	prob lip studs|`|IYmbdhYHaa	well they prefer me to have the hoooop.

He will never give in. <br>  :)|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	once you have a piercing there, there is no turning back.  you will always have a hole on your lips.  you will have to get used to eating and drinking with that metal thing for awhile, and clean everyday for a few months.  my parents were the same as yours, but I listened to them.  when I got a job, started to live by myself, I could do whatever I wanted.  I finally got my ear pierced as a start, didn't really feel as great as I thought.  still have to clean from time to time, not very happy with it.  not really regretting, but definitely not wanting that on my face or belly button.
f571f23e020f0ced1b02ff792dc20542aa	you have really pretty eyes<br>  and nice high cheek bones (:|`|HhpRxYSLaa	Attention seeking much? Why do you need someone to tell you how good you look?<br>  <br>  Honestly you are very pretty but my first impression is that you are fake looking. Tan skin/bleach blonde hair/too much makeup. If you eased up on the tanning and let your fair skin glow, and lightened up on the makeup you would be much more stunning.<br>  <br>  Also, looking at your eyebrows you're a natural redhead/strawberry blonde, right?<br>  <br>  And that 3rd picture is skanky. :/|`|SUG8wXmUaa	The first thing i notice is that you cake on makeup, and the second thing i notice is that you look like every other tan bleach blonde hair girl out there.

tfqpb5XQaa	2 and a half years is a long time for it to be healing. If i was you i'd just take it out, their has to be something wrong with it. Take it out, wait for it to close up and get it re pierced somewhere else if you want it done again.<br>  It should of healed a long time ago, as long as you're not playing with it or hitting it or sleeping on it their should be no reason its still healing, unless its rejecting and you're not noticing it.|`|GAmlREmsaa	Dont let your clothing rub the piercing.

gXrwqoTGaa	Wow your boyfriend is an @$$. But from the looks of it he dumped you because he wanted to be with the more popular girl who will easily give it (sex) up.

I myself am really thin-its in my genes.  I hate it. I have been rejected before because I wasn't thick. My best friend is overweight and she doesn't seem to have a problem finding good men.  I did say "men" not boys.  It doesn't matter how old they are really, you can turn 30 and you will realize even some grown men are still boys.<br>  <br>  P.S. In schoolboys I did notice that guys dont like it when other guys think you are hot.  Maybe his friends were talking and he got jealous and he didn't want the competition.  Possibly why he is trying to break your confidence.|`|glOPAyeIaa	its just an excuse. dont worry, your beautiful, hes just to dumb to realize it=)<br>  <br>  <br>  Lindsay|`|MfxQv0k8aa	wow, jerk much ?!<br>  i bet yr thin too.<br>  ugh, i HATE guys like this.<br>  you are wayyyy too good for him.|`|J8LASik0aa	If he broke up with you because you're not "thin enough" then he didn't really like you in the first place.

I'd wait at least 4-6 weeks. You say that you don't like the earrings, would you rather take them out and risk getting infection...or..just wait the time out?
OSza8iexaa	The plank ... it is very easy to do ... very hard to hold.  15-30 second intervals to start with ... it is priceless it's so effective.<br>  <br>  Anything isometric ... a really good one for thighs and core ... lie with your back flat on floor, feet flat ... raise legs bent at the knees and push against your flat hand and hold pressure for a 12 count ... these are extremely effective.<br>  <br>  for your thighs ... wall squats, no weight ... also another version my friend showed me the other weekend that almost killed me ... squat into position then lift an alternate leg straight out and hold for as long as you can ... 15-30 second intervals ... you've got to be serious to do these.<br>  <br>  If you have the discipline to do these, invest 5-10 minutes a day of actual exercising (that's it, not counting rest) and you will see a difference in a matter of days I promise.

F0IeVJ0Iaa	i would highly recommend neutrogena instant bronze its a foam<br>  its a sunless tanner and bronzer in one<br>  so u can see where you applied it and instantly have a bronze glow<br>  i would use it on your face neck and chest <br>  but on your body you might want to mix it with lotion <br>  so its not streaky at all<br>  or use the jergens tinted mosturizer for your body it works well|`|dfMDTTUAaa	Apparently St tropez is the absolute best, kinda pricey though|`|v8XEDQsQaa	I tan alot and use a self tanner (i think i've tried everything under 50 bucks). The one that works the best is Clarins Self Tanning Milk hands<br>  down!  Its looks very natural,makes me the darkest and doesn't smell bad either. You can't get it at CVS you'll have to go to a department store at the Clarins counter. The price is about 30 buck but its so worth it. Wait til people start asking you if you've been to Fla. Then you know your dark! Good Luck!|`|SvMKiVMkaa	you cant be bronzed if youre pale because if you wear some type of make up that is not your skin color it will look like you wear too much make up or you dont know how to apply make up correctly|`|BYWDIhuLaa	you can get the neutrogena bidy tanning spray at walmart for like 8 bucks and it works great becasue thats what i use in the dead of winter good luck|`|2Urd6VLqaa	The Jergan's Natural Glow lotion works pretty good. It gradually builds your tan over time.<br>  <br>  ?|`|tfpmqkt8aa	Aaaahh, I feel your pain! I shop for all of my skin care products through BeautiControl. Here is the website <a href="http://www.beautipage.com/spadiva_misty." rel="nofollow">http://www.beautipage.com/spadiva_misty.</a> They have tanning lotions for the face and for the body that work wonders! I love them! I can't go to a tanner because I get skin discolorations from being in the sun/tanner. I use what is called Triple Glow for face & Triple Glow for body. Item number is #14295 & #14296. I paid $47.50 for both which is a great price for the what you are getting. Also, if you don't like it, there is a 100% garauntee and you can get your money back. Don't go for the cheap stuff. This will build your tan over time and you can decide how dark you want to go. I swear by this stuff. It's awesome! Happy Tanning!|`|en208Kfoaa	Jergens natural glow. Go for the medium skin tone even if your pale.
glOPAyeIaa	yeah, i agree with the first girl. i personally LOVE helping girls figgure out what haircut look best on them, but i hate it when girl go, "i have long blonde hair, like to my shoulders, big blue eyes, and a tan, what haircut should i get?" grr, that makes me sooo irritated.<br>  <br>  <br>  =)<br>  LIndzz|`|OxUnUolBaa	Only when a girl says:<br>  <br>  "Okay!

I don't want to cut more than a half inch off and I still want it to be wavy."<br>  <br>  It's like, HELLO!, you want a change get a change, or else keep yourself shut!|`|MTcs2pKwaa	Nope.Not really.|`|DGrbpbq1aa	Not really.|`|6FIhIQ3Eaa	thats a silly reason to hate sumone.|`|miU0ogXiaa	only if they don't show a picture of their face|`|DySUxIn4aa	No, only when they don't show a picture.|`|WRXNoZPRaa	yeahh if they dont show a pic..and just explain...otherwise dont really mind it.
IlweVgxhaa	I live in Alaska so I've got the cold outfits covered. But what temperature are you talking about for warm... 'cause we're crazy and call 40-50 warm =) ? Also.... Whats your style?<br>  <br>  Cold<br>  A) skinny jeans, leg warmers over them, ballet flats (my choice) or  converse (warmer), long sleeve shirt (green maybe depending on your hair/eye color, the shade is up to you) or a cute t-shirt with a jacket or fleece zip up, if you opt for the long sleeve shirt then go for either a sweater (optional) that matches the leg warmers or just a cute jacket. Jewelry would be like... bangles or a long simple necklace. Hair could be down depending on the length and maybe wind factor, if you want it up then either low pigtails or maybe a low side pony<br>  <br>  B) jeans (skinny or not), uggs (or bear-paws or whatever you have that's that style) either tuck in the jeans or have them over the shoes, another long sleeve shirt with a wide belt up so its like an empire waist, (I wouldn't recommend wearing a jacket with this one so save it for a warmer of the cold days or one where you'll be inside more often), simple necklace and ring, ponytail or braids<br>  <br>  C) Jeans of your choice, converse, a simple shirt (no graphic tees), your favorite jacket, a cute scarf (white black and a color of your choice maybe?), simple jewlery like a ring or maybe a bracelet, hair in a pony tail <br>  <br>  Wear your usual make up.<br>  <br>  Warm<br>  <br>  A) light wash jeans (maybe pre ripped), a cute bright tank-top (maybe with lace at the top), a cropped black or white sweater (just covers the straps and doesn't go down past your rib cage), ballet flats, big belt (must look good with the color of the tank top), colorful bracelets or earrings, straight hair if left down or maybe low pigtails or a high pony tail<br>  <br>  B) Jean skirt (mini), colorful tights, ballet flats, t shirt that matches the tights and a big black belt slung across your hips, sinple necklace (silver), messy bun  or maybe a head band<br>  <br>  C) jeans (skirt or pants), plain yellow tank top, pink button up (capped sleeves?), brown (leather looking) belt across your hips, light brown uggs or maybe ankle boots earrings, braids<br>  <br>  wear your usual make up<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|Oejricveaa	Are you a girl or guy?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Here are some things for warm weather.<br>  <a href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/collection/?cgname=OSSWMCOVZZZ&cgnbr=OSSWMCOVZZZ&rfnbr=1339" rel="nofollow">http://www2.victoriassecret.com/collecti...</a>|`|n6IBfiDPaa	You can always mix and match things!<br>  For instance, take something as simple as boots, put it with some jeans to tuck in, a cute lacey tank top with a cute jacket over the top for the cold...<br>  Then just take off the jacket and swap the jeans for a skirt!

IXCxjl8Zaa	For spring, I would invest in some good cardigans.<br>  For under 10$ you can get cute tanks to layer under.<br>  Dresses are your cheapest bet for spring becuase you only have to buy 1 thing and you can put on sweaters or change tanks to make it look different.<br>  <br>  If you have the basics you could just buy some inexpensive accesories and wear them with your basics to mix it up.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I love cardigans, capris, bermudas|`|Oti6JXJIaa	go to platos closet they have all the in stuff like juicy coututre, ruehl, abercrombie and fitch, and hollister for cheap and a whole bunch of other stuff.|`|rPB6VqfOaa	You can probably find just about all of them at either Forever21 or at Urban Outfitters. <br>  -Gladiator Sandals<br>  -Plaid shirts<br>  -Jumpers (rompers)<br>  -Oversized sunglasses<br>  -Oversized totes<br>  -motorcycle jacket<br>  -one shoulder tops/dresses<br>  -sunrise colors<br>  -crochet<br>  -cutout booties<br>  -high-wasted skirts<br>  -boyfriend jeans <br>  <br>  <br>  and thats about all i can think of. but as long as you have those you will be all set :)|`|js43U9GPaa	Alright. florals are in, maxi dresser, skinny jeans, cardigans, animal print.<br>  <br>  try<br>  forever21.com<br>  wetseal.com<br>  delias.com<br>  hollisterco.com<br>  AE.com|`|B3guO2ZRaa	Cheap and in don't really go together.

You can go to Marshalls or TG max and get cool designer duds for under twenty dollars. Get new cool trendy purses, and maybe add jewlery. Jewelery can make any outfit sparkle. Get things that are in season and get cool stuff that are very decrative. Get skinny jeans in dark colors, and try to get more neutral make up. Do your hair diffrently everyday!|`|cGKDJaqpaa	so NOT abercrombie and hollister, because that stuff is not cute, and just overplayed. <br>  what about just black jeans or light wash, motorcycle jackets, and like cute tops?<br>  urban outfitters status...
vtW3qPZmaa	Start waxing instead of shaving - shaving will always give you razor burn and ingrown hairs.
5DJcir9saa	need to see a picture of the shirt to put everything else together<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok...now I think you should wear some skinny jeans with flats.  Very cute top by the way!!  For jewelry, maybe just some silver hoops.  Because this is a casual top, keep the makeup neutral and to a minimum.  Maybe some olive green eyeshadow lightly dusted over your eyes and some clear lip gloss.  Add some mascara if thats part of your daily routine but skip the liner.|`|dfMDTTUAaa	I think you should wear either a flippy high waisted skirt that ends just above the knee or some shorts with some muted colored tights - deep purple ones look good. High heels all the way honey! For jewelry, a few big bangles and you're good to go and as for the makeup I would keep it natural so just prime and foundation or whatever you do normally, natural lips so a light gloss and as for eyes a pale eyeshadow in a candy-floss color looks gorgeous with your skin tone or if you want to be dramatic, go for smokey eyes. Have a great time!
5yn7Wh7Aaa	I suffer with eczema when I am under stress. If you have it on your body, visit your doctor who can prescribe you Hydrocortizone.<br>  <br>  On your face, use Oilatum cream, or the plain nivea cream you get in the blue pot. It's totally fragrance free, and will reduce the soreness and redness.|`|A5wb4vXYaa	Sudocrem and E45 Cream are good (but don't go out with them smeared all over your face like my friend did ;)<br>  Also I tried Shea Butter which is really good stuff... It claims to soften, protect and replenish damaged skin (Y) it's cheap and it actually works... But seriously try to get the most organic and natural as possible, because  all of the other stuff has other things in it which could potentially irritate your eczema more...|`|BA9ymc2Laa	I have the same problem and was told by my dermatologist not to use any all but to use moisturizer that is "free", no color, no Fragrance.
