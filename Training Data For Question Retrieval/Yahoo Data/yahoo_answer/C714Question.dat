He wears pink because "it's a beautiful color"   He wears multiple polo shirts, one over another, even when it's warm out   He feels the need to have a girlfriend   He said he'd kill himself if I broke up with him   He's 18   He said "your the most beautifulest girl of my entire dreams"   He is already concerned about finding the right girl   When he sings, he sounds like a girl   He doesn't smell the best   He writes poems about girls A LOT   He cries everytime he gets dumped   He calls sometimes late at night   He said he likes shopping for shoes   He cries in public and its obvious when he's angry         I'm not joking about any of this, and he's calling me again! What do you think of him? I'm not trying to be mean, but this is what he's like.
20090130203301AAfea2R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I was just wondering about this boy I may know?	Ok so I've been talking to this guy and I can't really tell if he likes me. We go to different schools, one school district over, and we live in the same town and get together with a group of friends occasionally. But anyways I've been talking to him over myspace and we were talking about football and I said I couldn't catch a football, yeah I know sad, and he was like teasing me, and so I said you should teach me how to catch a football :) and then I was like I play volleyball I don't need to know how to catch, and he was like lol, sounds good, but i dont know which he is talking about teaching me how to catch or sticking to volleyball, idk. He's not very specific he often confuses me, lol. But like I like him he's cute and funny and stuff, but i can't tell if he likes me, he seems shy and I'm running out of things to talk about. Plus I am really shy and it took me a few days plus scolding from my friends before I got the courage to send him a message thingy and I was surprised when he responded. And when we get together with friends the girls kinda split off from the guys and vice versa, I know that that's not a lot of information but I really can't tell because I don't want to waste my time on someone I'll never have a chance with, cause honestly crushes suck. Does he like me? Should i tell him I like him even though I barely know him?  Should i get to know him more and wait it out? what to do.

(he told me)      im so confused.   do you think the one guy like me?   if yeah then why doesn't he just tell me?   or something.   thanks for helping         also theres a winter dance coming up soon.      do you think the guy is waiting to    "make a move" then?      or is he just not interested?

20090408045542AAojUJ5	Family & Relationships;Family	Any ideas on how to deal with this family situation?	I'm in my early 30's and I feel detached from my family.  I spoke about this in counselling on day and my therapist said it seemed like I somewhere down the line I became apart from my family but wasn't put back together properly.      If I attend a family meal or event I feel out of place and like I don't belong.  Anyone who tries to talk to me and says how great it is to see me come across as false.  These people never ask about me and then when they meet me they're all about me!      I'm the youngest of five and there's a sizable gap between myself and my next sibling.  There's only a year or two between the other four siblings so they've always had each other.      Has anybody else been in a situation like this?  I've considered just moving and not telling anybody so I can get a fresh start.  The only thing that keeps me where I am are my nieces and nephews.  Can anyone offer me some advice?  I've stood on my own two feet for years now and feel I don't need them anymore.  I suppose I'm confused about why i'm feeling this way but there has to be someone else out there who feels the same?
20090130204053AAe5ZFx	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I bad kid, am I going to hell?	To make a very long story short, a forty year old pedophile was stalking me on the internet. He was able to get my address by tricking me into giving him my IP. I freaked out, he knew my address and where I lived.. so what did I do? You bet. I told my parents! They got mad and said I was attention seeking and made it up.   I ignored him and hoped he would stop messaging me, I got a message one day from him. In the message, he clarified my address, and said how he was coming, how he would rape, kill, then rape me. I was horrified. I didn't have parents on my side, so I turned off the computer and ran to my room. I later took a shower... I cut myself up.  thought it might calm me down. Cutters at school are out-casted, and I was told they will go to hell because they hurt them self. I didn't do it again. What is going to happen to me?  He obviously has not come.. yet.  What do I do? I can't defend myself from him. I'm just a kid. Please tell me what I can do?    I promise I'm telling the truth, I'm not attention-seeking.

20090130204358AAIly5V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Oh my gosh HELP. Please. ?	Ok so there's this guy that I am totally in love with and he is in love with me too. We've known each other since we were 2, but we didn't start liking each other more than friends until about October 2008. He went to my school, but he left to be home-schooled today. I am really  sad. He is excited to be home-schooled but he says he will really miss me. We are always flirting and we are perfect for each other.... But we won't get to see each other that often because his parents are concerned about him. He does not get the best grades (that's why they are trying to home-school him) and they really want to focus. Our parents are good friends, but his parents told my parents that he just doesn't have time for a girlfriend and that he has to keep his focus in school. But he doesn't care about school, he cares about me and water polo (he is on the first place team 14 and under for the USA, so that is a priority). His parents keep interfering with our relationship and I'm just scared that I will lose him until we're really old enough to date. Any advice? PLEASE HELP ME. I love him, he loves me, but his parents are starting to really get on our nerves.

I went to bed tonight and my hubby came home from a friends house across the street to kiss me goodnight and let me know they were heading out yo the bar to play pool. before he left i seen him grab a shirt out of his drawer, he walked out of the bedroon and shut the door. I had a feeling he was changing his shirt sa after he left i noticed that he did cuz the one he was wearing was crumpled by a pile of clothes on the table...he has this shirt that he thinks is hilarious, it say "DANGER GIANT PENIS" Do you think its kinda shady that he changed to that shirt to go play pool at the bar with the fellas. Is it basically an invitation for other women or is he just being a pig?!?!

20090130133004AAwbKxi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm so ANGRY with my husband!! Would you be angry? What should I do? (Adults only please)?	I have always said to my husband that if were out and we met a nice girl who was up for some fun with us that I would be ok with the idea of a threesome. He's much older than me (by 20 years) so he doesn't really like going out and I always go to clubs or bars with my girlfriend's, so we never meet anyone.       It was his birthday the other day, and I arranged a babysitter, booked his favourite restaurant and got all dressed up. We don't get to go out together a lot because we have a five year old daughter ( we go out maybe 4 times a year). Anyway, I know that some time ago he made some stupid profile on a swingers site, and he spends quite some time on it. He told me while we were out at the restaurant that he's met some girl on this site and that they've been talking trashy over IM (I knew nothing about this). So, at this really romantic restaurant he starts telling me all the stuff they've been saying (this woman just seems mad, she's really into weired domination games and she wants to do things like see who can stuff a dildo down their throat the furthest etc) and she's also been sending my husband photos (nothing too kinky, but photos of her dressed up etc). It just seems to me that he's gone from me saying that I would be ok meeting a girl in a bar to him privately chatting to some mad bint on the internet. Am I being a bit over sensitive? I was also quite offended just by the very fact that I actually had to borrow money to take him out and he spent most of his night enthusiastically talking about how another girl sounds so great in bed!!! How would you feel? What would you do?

20090130204815AA6TAd6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Alright- Guy help anyone?	Alright so here's the story-      I'm a freshman; I've had my fair amount of boyfriends but obviously I'm pretty young- I've dated around though.      Last year in the 8th grade I had a boyfriend that I dated for about 6 months and then we ended it. I haven't really been interested in anyone since then.  I've had a few little crushes here and there- but no relationships- For the most part I've focused on my grades and friends.       So yesterday it finally happened- I got the butterflies. I was staying after school for a while in our school theater with a few friends, and this guy was there. I've always thought he was cute but I've never acknowledged him or talked to him- He's a sophomore. Well I sat down next to him and BAM!- Major chemistry. We got to talking and before you knew it we were laughing it up sitting in the same chair with our arms around each other. We were just joking though- We laughed and flirted about sneaking out in the hallway to make out. We weren't seriously going to do it though; we were just having fun.       The problem is, the more I talked to him the more I realized that I wasn't joking- I have developed a sudden liking for this guy. He's absolutely adorable- Very sweet and absolutely hilarious- [pretty hawt also if I might add]- He brought back the real me, the happy me. I was laughing and flirting and just being myself- I felt like we were best friends and had known each other for like forever. I feel so close to him already and yet I barely know him. I mean somehow it just felt so right- all cuddled up next to him laughing and joking.       The point is- he made me smile- a lot. But I don't think he realizes that he hit me hard. I'm love struck and I don't think this is just some silly crush or infatuation. I stayed up last night emailing him back and forth for like two hours straight. I've never had so much fun talking to absolutely anyone- and I've never felt that comfortable around anyone in my entire life.       But when I fell asleep last night I was distraught as I realized it will probably never happen- to him I'm just his probably just his new little flirting buddy. I don't want it to be like that though- he makes me smile- it's ridiculous. I've never been so happy. I want him to know that before my chance is gone. What should I do? I don't feel like I should tell him since we just started getting close- but at the same time I don't want to miss my chance!      Side note- I'm more of the really cutesy cuddly type- cuteness. I'm a strong Christian and I'm not into anything more than just kissing.

20090130204247AAQpUE6	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can a bride and groom write in an entirely new surname on marriage license in Georgia?	I know that Georgia is one of a handful of states where the groom can also change his last name on the marriage license... however, both the groom and I would like to change our maiden last names to his middle name (a family name that we're very attached to). I don't know if in Georgia we can write in an entirely new surname or if we have to stick with the usual his name/her name/hyphenated name.      TIA!
20090130204309AA1ePsR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am 16 and Lonely...?	i'm a male, 16, and i been feeling very depressed of late. i know that there are like six dozen other guys who have posted this same thing, but they seem to exaggerate on their situation, even though are perfectly likeable people. i feel that my situation is a little worse.    i'm the guy who was and is picked on for my looks, my personality and the fact that i look smart but i'm really not. i'm the classic high school dork who is socially awkward and who girls tolerate, but don't really like. i have acne all over my face (not bad acne, but it's still there). as my screen-name suggests i like to cook, but that is really the only redeeming quality about me. i dont play sports, i'm not really fit (but not fat either), and i drown my problems in the blood of the enemies i kill in games. trust me, i've tried asking girls out several times, and since i'm writing this you can guess how those ended.    *whew*   so, any suggestions or words of wisdom?   i'll try to post a picture of my-self if i can upload one.

20090408044849AAC65Hv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will I have to ask her or not?	I've known this girl for about 2 1/2 years. I know she likes me since almost every time I look at her she's staring at me and I just mouth the words "What?" and she quickly looks away. Then other times she just will randomly walk up and give me a hug (It's at our school's football games), then runs away. I wonder if she's just taking her time to ask me or if I'll have to ask her. Yes, it's already obvious that I like her too. I think I already know the answer but I just want your guy's opinions.
20090130151343AAIDit2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this a red flag or should I support him through it?	My boyfriend of 2 years (who wants to get married) works summers and makes about $80,000 in a few months. This past summer he didn't do well and has been scraping by to make mortgage and car payments. He is in flight school but is taking the semester off because of money. Often, I'm the one who bails him out. I've given him thousands of dollars while he sits around complaining about how stressed he is over money. He has not looked for a job, even something like waiting tables which could help him pay some bills. Instead, he just borrows money from people and freaks out over money. I know I've enabled him by offering to loan him money, but I did so because I know how awful it is to be stressed about money. Now I can't afford him anymore. I've offered to help him apply for school loans and grants and given him names of people who could get him a job, but he's not interested. He says it's "not enough to make a difference."       This is starting to come between us....what should I do?

20090130144922AAbaifM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am being too jealous?	Every time my fiance goes to work he has to do weights. Its like he cant leave one single day without having done a set of weights. I guess it helps him look a little more buff for a while.    It gets me so jealous because I start thinking that maybe there's someone at work who he's trying to look good for. The thing is, he kind cheated on me once with a co-worker (who no longer works there) so I have a hard time trusting him.      Am I overreaccting? Or should I be jealous?
20090130151755AAhTIlU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Theres two guys, not sure who to go after..?	so theres this guy in my science class, he sits behind me, so its hard to know if hes "checking" me out, or  stares or something.   But everytime i turn around he'll be like talking to someone, and while he does he like looks right into my eyes, or something, even if i just turn around and then turn back.Hes really cute, and when he does i usualy just smile, because hes usualy saying something funny, or ill laugh, hes smiled at me before too.      the second guy is in my music class, and i think i know why i think hes cute, since school started and i saw him, he reminded me of this guy i knew but like the good i saw in that guy, i know if probably doesnt make sense but whatever. so hes really nice to everyone, nice smile, cute, and plays the guitar. Problem is he sits kind of far away from me in music, but i saw him looking at me once, and when i was laughing today he looked over and smiled.      So, im just wondering, what guy should i go for? i could go either way, since i dont really know them, but until then, who should i foucus on?      thanks

Now he hangs out with them ALL the TIME. Anyway, a girl in that class WHO IS EXTREMELY UGLY falls for this boy. And what do you know? He does too.      So, every time this girl is in the hallway and LEANING casually against the wall, he sees her, and asks our teacher: "Can I go to the bathroom?" Ooooooooo      So do you think this is awkward? He's already dating someone, and last year, he actually sang "With You" by Chris Brown to her. EWWWWWWWWWWWW      We even think he kissed her. Think of that, a sophomore dating a senior!!!!!!! AWKWARD! Don't u think? :>

20090130150003AACwcsZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are parents in law really problems?	I have made a really good impression on my gf's parents, and that makes me feel happy. But I am really worried about how my mom will react towards my gf... I always thought my mom would be so accepting of everything I do, but right now, she seems to be just a little bit tense, asking me if I am sure this is a great person, etc., and she has not really met her yet, and so I am concerned.       Why is my mom having this reaction, before even meeting my gf? The thing is, my gf is just the most honest and down-to-earth person I have met, she is not a "bad girl" (we are waiting until marriage, in fact), she is able to understand me emotionally like others cannot, she is a good university student, she seems to care about everyone, even if it gets her nothing in return. Basically, I know she can present no harm to me, and my mom should not be worried... But my mom IS worried...      The thing is,  my gf is not the type of person who would ever tell me that my mom is hurting her in any way, or who would tell me anything about how horrible my mom has been...  No matter what my mom would say, I know she would always be kind to her, and I am afraid that my mom will try to sort of "push" my gf away, which will hurt my gf, and I know she is not going to push back. She will just be hurt.       What should I do? I don't now why I am so worried, even. I already tell my mom all the good things about her, and ask my mom to trust me in choosing a partner, because this was done with all the values that she instilled in me and the intuition that I have from that...      Are my concerns even normal? I just am afraid that people will get hurt, and I want everyone to get along :\
20090130145948AAsM3le	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If I get married can the court take money out of my paycheck to pay for my new husbands child-support? ?	My fiance and me have a 7 month old son together, but when i was pregnant we split up. In that time he got another girl pregnant. She was very mad when she found out we were back together her daughter is now 3 months old. She dropped her daughter off when she almost 2 months old and came and picked her up this week. Now she is saying we can not see the baby and she has a court date for child support. I have a couple questions. If me and him marry and he is out of work could they take the money out of my check? Will they take into consideration that we have a 7 month old that he is taking care of? Another part of the story is he has a warrant out for his arrest he is planning to turn himself in once our son is a year. If he goes to jail after we are married can she fight for child support from me? can she file back child support once he is out, because he wont be able to pay if he is in jail?

20090130145200AA74zte	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! This has been going on for a month! where are we going?	i met this guy who works at a club in december. he is hot!   we flirted, we made out, he got my name. he added me on facebook we re friends.  now we occasionally chat, hes never online,  he s 19, he studies economy and administrative marketing in college, he s mexican, very hot, and i think we could work something out  only every time he wants to see me, its either at his club when he works, or at some other club but id rather not see him again in a club.  i ve turned down 2 'invitations'  i asked him to come party with my friends saturday night  but he was working    so ive asked him out (yeah i know...lame!) to go for coffee at first, or a drink, then for dinner, but not directly, i mean i didnt set a date or a time, its his job to do that, right? if he s shy, at least im handing him the opportunity to ask me out    some of you may say that he s playing me, im sure he is, but he keeps saying that im pretty, he calls me mamacita, and he  told me he never made out like that with anyone. why not?  he only has a home phone so i cant call him to plan anything, and its still awkward for me to plan things, ive never been in a situation like that. he s very lazy  but i think he is interested, he sent me on tuesday the most random message saying that he was at school, bored, and that it would be great if i ever paid him a visit there.(but his school is so far from mine!)  at least he was thinking of me  :)... (bootycall???????)    i asked him out for a make up dinner tonight since i missed the chance to see him twice, but since he still didnt reply i didnt wanted to look awkward so i said i eventually had last minute plans for tonight and that id love to go out some other time.....!! AAAGHK!    where is this going???     i wanted to ask him out AGAIN for valentines day... its a friends birthday party at a mexican restaurant so if i use my +1 privilege maybe it could work. is it a good idea?    one last thing, im going to his club again on the 21st with a bunch of friends for an event (live band columbian music) so ill see him there anyways because he works, but i sorta kinda wanted to see him before    is he worth it???? im starting to get real impatient eventhough i want him... i mean twice he asked for my number but he never calls...what the f?

20090130153345AA6Hg8Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	SHY GUYS ONLY: HELP A GIRL DECODE THIS!?	SHY GUYS ONLY: HELP A GIRL DECODE THIS!?  There is a guy i sort of suspected liked me, but he never made a move, bc i thought he was shy. So id had enough and decided to ask him what exactly we were doing.....     First he said, sure we were friends. then said we hadnt gotten know to know each other better but for only a couple of weeks (even tho we've been in classes for like 6 mos) he said he was "being cautious"bc of past relationships (a 4 yr relationship) he had. Then he said "Dont you know any indians?" Perhaps it was his way of saying he comes from a conservative family    And then he said "i dont even have your number yet" And first wanted me to take his (or maybe just wanted to exchange) and so im like ill just give you mine and then he changed his mind as i was getting ready to enter and just decided to take mine, rather than give me his. And then he called me right there.. i assume to store my number.    So i tried to reiterate what i thought he was trying to tell me by saying so are you saying that you dont want to commit to being more than friends just as you dont want to commit to being JUST friends" and he agree.. at which point i thought we understood each other.    since then i have not received a call from him (this was Wednesday) and he isnt coming around as much.    Is it possible this guy made up the part about being cautious to protect my feelings as well as following it up by asking for my number? I wouldnt have thought so... but bc hes backing off i dont know what to think.    If not, now wtf is he doing by coming around less often or "backing off"

20070216044615AAaLLAV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are you the type of guy who is generally not shy but can be really shy with the girl you like?	I want to understand you...    what would you want her to do/say?       I'm in a situation where I think we both like each other, but he can be really shy sometimes (as with me). When we talk, it's fine, because we are already good friends and know each other well. But it seems very difficult for either of us to initiate something?      I'm also not a shy girl generally speaking. But I've believed in the past that guys should make the first move. I have already made some moves, but I guess I've also given mixed signals in the past.

Then after that we went to petco and just walked around the store talking and looking at the animals, then at the end I took her home, gave her a hug and told her I had fun and she said she did too. So was it a date? Cuz I've never been on a date before.

Do you still touch guys who you feel no attraction to at all? My co-worker is always touching me, and putting her hands on me, and leaning on me, and all those things lol. And I don't think she's trying to lead me on or anything, because I now know her well enough to say that she's not like that at all. She touches some of the other guy workers, but not as much as me.....any insight on her?

20061219114445AAjO3jN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I wrong for not wanting to talk to him anymore??	I started going out with this nice man from my church about 2 months ago.  We only went to the movies once and maybe out to dinner 5 or 6 times.  It was just a friendship as far as I was concerned.  After a while he started telling our pastor that when we get married he wanted him to perform the ceremony and even wanted me to meet his family.  He is always talking about how he wants to  build a life with me and how one day he wants to marry me.   I do not feel this way about him at all.  He is moving way too fast for me and I don't want to be bothered with him at all.  I haven't talked to him in about 3 weeks.  Everytime he calls I just let it go into voice mail and never return his calls.  I was hoping that by now he would get the hint that I don't want to be bothered but he still continues to call asking me to call him back.     What more can I do?  I don't want to just come out and tell him hey looser leave me alone and get a life.  How can I handle this situation without hurting him?

20070113070720AAuuv2K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I feel guilty???	Im gonna try and sum up my situation. This girl has liked me for almost as long as i can remember, i was a complete jackass to her for a time (thats not what im asking about though). About 7 months ago i realized that i actually liked her, the problem was i was leaving to be a foriegn exchange student in 1 month for a year. I told her i liked her, and we agreed that wed see what to do once i get back. And for now see other people. She has been dating this jackass, and she keeps saying if i hadnt left her, it would be me and not him, but she says it all the time, and im really startin to feel guilty, its almost like she expects me to regret coming here (Chile). And that is something i cant do, cause this has been the experience of my life, but should i feel guilty about coming here and leaving her, because i do really like her.
20070123063328AAX4ZcC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Left the man who couldnt make up his mind, found another GREAT one and now old wants me back?	was with a guy who wouldnt settle for the title but we did everything as a bf and gf k inda we were together but not i was "off limits but not taken" quote on quote of him. we had some serious fire and when things were good with us they were great. when they were bad they were miserable.   So one night when things were bad I went out with some girls and met this guy that was seriously instantaneous attractiion and every night we have sat and had tea and talk for hours i can see a huge future with this man possibly THE man.   and the old guy comes around this morning saying how much he loves me and that he will settle for commitment as long as I come back....?      go back to an old flame   or hurt the old flame and stay with the new?      mind you I know I love him. But i know my gut and everyone around me has been telling me to get away from him for months now that he is going to never change.      but thing is i have seen him change over months when i met him he was an alcoholic...

Hi,   I would like to know is there a quick way to learn martial arts, karate or any other way to get stronger in a short period of time?   I would like to do this because I dont like an induvidual at my school and would just like to punch him or beat him up this is because of recent happenings(see below).    But at the moment he is very strong, and I am very weak.   Is there any way to get stronger than him? so I can have a go at him?   That person has done things to me like ripping my coursework up stealing my bag, taking things from my pocket, puncturing my cycle tire, and when you talk to him he starts making fun up and doesnt really listen. When you say something he will hold it against you!   And when he is with his friend he is worse! He starts saying stuff about my family and that stuff.    When I was his mate he told me stuff like he smokes and does skunk (a type of drug) but he told me not to tell his parents.   His brothers even lock teachers in class rooms!       Thanks!

She hangs out with me less and call less often. A year ago we were inseperable. My daughter and I were even in her wedding. All I can think is that  she has being trying to have a child for over a year now and I just had twin boys naturally. Perhaps this is a bit painful for her. Do you think this could be it? Either way how can I let her know I love her and value her freindship?

20090130153337AAqmiAL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does she sometimes choose to talk to her friend rather than me but will not leave me with her friend?	It's really confusing how she sometimes chooses to talk to her friend rather than me, yet when her friend wants to go somewhere else she'll always refuse and stay here and sit/talk with me. So her friend ends up leaving by herself. Also, we aren't a couple I guess we are friends that have a little tension cause I don't know where I stand with her and the same goes for me.

20090130151951AAyO9JC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend doesn't seem all that into me?!?	okay well my bf of 3 months doesn't seem all that into me. I mean I take into consideration he is shy and stuff but he is overly shy when he is with me! We haven't had our first kiss or anything, we have only held hands once, and it was after he found out I was sad about how he acts ^^ (title explains how he acts) and i'm just confused. I have liked him for 2 years and he has liked me back for the same amount. Should I dump him or tell him how I feel about us? I have tried the second one btw. He can't take a hint. I am so conflicted!!!

20061010142210AAEOGOv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you know where Stuart Mackinlay is?	Who ever said "nobody dies of a broken heart" doesn't know what they are talking about because I am dying here without the man who stole my heart.  Please help me find him, any information about where or how he is would help ease some of the pain.  Stuart is 32 years of age, 6ft tall with quite a stocky build.  He has a tattoo of a samurai on his  left upper arm and another tattoo of a small buddha on the inside of his right wrist. Stuart was last seen in York, North Yorkshire at the beginning of June but could be anywhere in the UK by now. It sounds sad but it's true, I told him I will love him forever and I will.  The day I stop searching is the day I give up and die.  Please, please give any information if you can help.

He told me to call him anytime. I told him the same.      Sounds like he is still interested right?? Read on....      2 days later I msged him. He said he was doing well, thanked me for the msg and tol me that he is sure he will talk to me soon. I told him that I was fine and that I had a great time the other night.

Guy problems?   i went out with a great guy the other night and it went great except for one thing. during the movie he reached to hold my hand but since i was so nervous, i blurted out "what are you doing?! ". he must have thought i was thinking he was going to do something disrespectful or gross, but really i knew he just wanted to hold my hand which was really sweet., so he just backed off and obviously i hurt his feelings and probably thought i was weird. after that things between us got silent and awkward. before i got out of his car i told him i really do like him and we exchanged phone numbers. well, the next day, we didn't even say hi to each other. i think he was waiting for me to say something first since i was always the first one to start a conversation. but i just didn't know what to say to him. i don't know waht to do , does he still like me i feel that he still likes me but hwy didn't he say anything? was he just shy? what is going on?

20090130171238AAi6rQB	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend invited my other friends to the mall with her but not me?	I have no idea why, but all my friends have been telling me they're going to the mall with my other friend. Even my cousin is going. But my friend didn't invite me.    I know going to the mall doesn't seem like a big deal, but my friends and I rarely go anywhere together. We might see each other around, but planning to go somewhere is something we only do once in a great while.    I don't know what I should do. I'm really angry with her because she wouldn't do something like this. I think there might be a reason, but I can't think of anything I've said that would upset her. I was thinking maybe she might be angry because me, my cousin, and two of my friends (the twins) went to see Twilight without her, but we told her and she never asked to come along or even hint that she would like to. She never told me anything about this.    So here's some possible things I can do:    -Confront her. I'm sort of a confrontational person, but I don't know if I'm brave enough to say "Why didn't you invite me?"    -Show up even though I wasn't invited. One of the twins wants me to do this one, because she doesn't really like the girl who invited them and doesn't want to hang with her without me there.    -Ignore it. If she doesn't want me to know, I'll pretend I don't.    -Give her the silent treatment. I can do that for a long time.    -Get angry at her or bluntly give her the silent treatment. It'll make her guess what I'm angry about, and she'll bring it up.    -Stop being her friend. When I feel like a person doesn't want to be my friend, I'll break it off before they do. But does she want to stop being my friend? I don't know, she acts normal still.      That's all I got. Pick what you think is best or think of something better, I think I might have missed something but I'm not really sure. Thanks for the help.
20090130171435AAUvoVh	Family & Relationships;Friends	2 friends in a fight. i am stuck in the middle?	i talked to both of them to get each of their sides. friend A told me that they were no longer friends over text but wanted to tell me the rest in person. so the next day at school i say friend B and asked her what was going on.       Freind B's side: Friend A is always ditching her to hang out with her latest boyfriend and she always has one and many other guys to choose from. Friend A doesnt treat her right and thinks that biys are more important. She then said that Friend A said "At least i can hold onto a boy for more than a week and dont change who i like every week!" Friend B then told me she wouldn't kick her. I asked if she meant form her life and from friendship and she said "No, I'm just not going to kick her the next time i see her."      When i asked Friend A what happened i got      Friend A's Side: She started to like one of her ex's again and told Friend B about it. Her phone died so she used Friend B's phone to text him that night. The next day, since Friend B had the guy's number, she texted him and invited him over to her house and then made-out with him. When Friend A found out she got really upset and then said that Friend B got mad at her for no reason.         They haven't been friends for long. Only a couple of months and they always seemed to have so much fun and they were always laughing about the good times that they had together.      I want them to be friends again and i see where they are both coming from but i want to know why Friend B didnt tell me about eh make-out session. I really just mostly want to stay out of it though and hope it works its self out. Do you think it will be possible they will just make up? DO you think that i can still be friends with both if they dont? Tell me everything that you think about this.

20090130165955AAzP5nA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was he jealous or just being a jerk?	So…my younger brother (who’s 14) decided sunday at church to tell Chad,a guy we're friends w/ (a guy I used to like) that I like a guy from Chad's school (Jake).Chad and I were kinda friends (I knew him pretty well, but we didn’t like go hand out or weren’t BFF’S) last summer.Now, He doesn't usually even say hi to me(and I don’t go out of my way to say hi to him).He called me on Xmas eve and we talked for 17mins,but since then he hasn't said much.But I catch him looking at me and occasionally he will come up to me with random stuff to say, ("is that your little sister's full name?","I have 8 sets of keys to my truck")    Sunday,after my bro told him bout Jake,Chad just looked @ me (he can b pretty stoic when he wants) and said, "How do YOU know Jake?" I told him,he walked off and I glanced @ him &caught him looking at me again from across the room.Then he walked back up to talk to my bro again but he wouldn't talk 2 me at all--ignored me.SO.....IS HE UPSET I DON’T LIKE HIM ANYMORE?DOES IT SOUND LIKE HE LIKES ME AND THAT'S WHY HE ACTED WEIRD AFTER THAT?Was he jealous?Chad and I are 17,btw.
20090130175212AA3zRNe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? (Crush advice)?	Here's the deal, I'm not sure what I should do now, regarding this guy I really like. Here's the deal, I met this guy named Jake at homecoming, After that I asked him out to get coffee, we did, after the whole coffee thing we just kind of talked after school as we walked to the bus, so my friend had hte bright idea of having me ask him to the sweethearts dance, which I did, but he said he couldn't go because he had already been asked. He was very polite and sweet about it. (: He also said he would have gone with me if he hadn't been asked.      So I was wondering, what should I do now? Should I just keep talking to him? I'm alright with him saying he can't go. Granted, I had a cry about it, but my hormones are raging, so I'm welcome to that.      I am no way mad/upset that he said no to the sweethearts dance, i just don't know what to do.      See, I think it is his turn to come to me  but he does nothing to seek me out or anything, he knows that I'm always at my friend's locker after school, which is right next to his, but he doesn't do anything, he waves, but generally, I say bye to him and what not. ugh.      I just don't know what to do.

20090130153712AAxYlXI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men who don't cuddle after ...!!!?	I recently asked a question as to if there are still men who cuddle after sex, I got some amusing answers and some answeres that were actually sweet. So I MUST know more. My last relationship ended because the man I was with wouldn't cuddle with me after sex. He would be sweet and polite leading up to it...even affectionate sometimes.     After we had sex it was like he'd turn into a different person, he'd hand me my clothes and start talking about things unrelated to anything we'd just done. It's like he'd go completely cold, happy but ice cold. I have moved on and seperated myself from this relationship and this man, refusing to maintain even a friendship, but...    The hurt from that rejection still pops up sometimes. I'd never had a man (not that there have been many to compare him by) not want to hold me for hours afterward. So am I losing my touch, becoming less lovable or does it depend on the guy?

20090130171504AAbYFib	Family & Relationships;Friends	I want to write a letter about my feelings to someone I know. What do you think?	I'm a 17 year old guy in grade 12. I'm a very shy person by nature, so it's hard for me to open up about myself. I've had a lot of problems in my life. A lot of negative thoughts and emotions about myself and so much pain within me. I won't go into too much detail because I get carried away when I write and this will end up being about 8 paragraphs. There's this girl that I know who I somehow was able to make a connection with last year. She's very nice and caring and she has opened up to me about certain problems she was having. I was glad she did because I liked to listen to her and make her feel better. She already graduated and came back for another semester. She just recently left so I'm all alone again.       She has wanted me to talk about my problems with her, but it's not easy for me, especially when other people are around. I got the idea that I would write about my feelings in a letter to her. Since I'm very shy, most people don't see certain things about me and don't know what to think. It's easier for me to express myself through writing than it is verbally. This letter would allow her to see who I really am and she might understand me a little more. This is all just tearing me up inside and I don't know who else to turn to. What do you think about this?
20090130160527AAsHCe7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you flirt with random girls on facebook?	some how my friend is really good at getting girls on facebook. but usually i say like hey or hey dont i know you from somewhere? or havent we meet before? usually that doesnt work so whats something better i can say other than hey to get them to reply back. but even if they reply, its obviously a lie that im acting like i know them just to get a convo. So how can i get a convo started and what are some things i shoud say wen they are like, ya i dont know you... And basicly what are some good things to say to subtly flirt with them cuz honestly im soooooooooooooooooooooo ******* shy its insane and facebook or myspace is pretty much the only way i can talk to girls.....

Finally, during one day, she gets the urge and does something unexpected and the consequences are extreme.  She glues her hand to yours and the only way to get free from her is to go to the certain hardware store where they sell a certain glue remover so you can get unstuck but she won't let you go to that store and she makes you keep walking with her.  What do you do?      A:  I would scream.      B:  I would try separating us with a form of utensil or something.      C:  I would say "No problem" and keep walking with her.      D:  I would book us for a slot of The Tonight Show.
20090130174813AAsZVzO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this girl likes me (interacial uncertainty)?	well today me and one of my best guy college friends were hanging out and a girl who is Chinese came to hang with us and me and her got on really really good...she laughed at everything i said and thinks im really smart since i prepped her for her midterm tomorrow. She walked mostly by my side and at the end of the night she wrapped her scarf around me (even though i said i didn't need it).      Part of the cause of uncertainty is best guy friend who is Chinese refers to her a like his little sister but they aren't related (i think its a culture thing/watches to much anime). This leads me to think she might just be being nice to me as her friend's friend. My guy friend has a girlfriend by the way.      So the problem is my race is indian(pretty good looking) and so it would be weird if her friends (which she says she says are shallow/hates) and just any other people saw us together.       So what do you people think while i sit here wrapped up in this girl's scarf?

I wanted to break the ice to talk to him and basically say I lovee the show he's talking about.      Would this be completely dumb? I don't want things to be awkward. I would just be like "I looove that show! sorry...random comment (:" Some of you might think that I should comment on HIM but the thing is...he might be gay. I really don't know. But I at least want to break the ice to be friends...so what do you think?         Thanks!   and again...sorry.I'm 18 but I feel like I'm 13 years old right now (no offense to those that are...)

20090130164325AAA7smT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my boyfriend to talk to me like a normal person?	My boyfriend is very moody and can be, for lack of a better word, downright mean. I'm the same way however since he asked me not to take out my problems on him, I don't, but he still does it to me. He's unbelievably disrespectful and it hurts me a lot. I'm not going to leave him for two reasons: I care too much and I'm not strong enough at this point in time. Any ideas as to what I can do?

20090130164905AAcpCis	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would a girl think if I had a handgun in my college dorm room?	Alright, now I'm a very normal guy.  I'm pretty popular at my college and I party and do well in school as well.    Anyhow, I carry around this BB gun for self-defense (we go to a college in Chicago).  The one I have can penetrate someone at close range, and some of my friends have already been mugged before, at like 8pm.  But nobody knows its a BB gun.  It looks EXACTLY like a handgun and even operates like one (we have to cock it back and it has a magazine at the bottom)    Anyhow, if you were a girl knowing me for the first time, and found a hand-gun looking thing in my dresser or if it fell out of my jacket one day, what would you think?  Would you be afraid to go out with me or spend time alone with me?  Just wondering.

20090130164356AAbX0ab	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm confused, where did the man that asked me to marry him go?	I don't want a divorce, please don't give me that for an answer.  I love my husband so much, but after the wedding, 5months ago, things are different.  I don't know if he still loves me, which hurts a lot because I very much love him, but I am in a lot of pain.  We were SO in love before our wedding he was sweet and kind, loving and affectionate.  Always had nice words for me, and made me feel really loved.  I'm not saying we didn't fight about stuff but we were both convinced that we were meant to be together.  Now he is distant, doesn't talk to me anymore, complains when I try to talk to him.  He is taking extra hours at work and is never home.  When he comes home is talks about cigars and hockey with his buddies on the phone then falls asleep on the couch.  He has become so critical of everything.  What is going on?  I am so confused!  I don't want a divorce, I would love to hear from any other ladies who had to fight for their man after their wedding..... He isn't cheating, he isn't himself, where did the man I fell for go?  He isn't happy, what is going on with him?  He seems depressed and annoyed about life.....  We are going to counseling, 2 times so far, but he seems annoyed at the councilor too.
20090130154524AAmRcLI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im an idiot :) help?!?!?	Basically, I really liked this guy, and I found out that he liked me too, and that he was going to ask me out :) (I found that out from one of his friends, and also because they're really bad at talking quietly :P). So I was really excited e.t.c, but then he never asked me out. So I assumed that he didn't like me anymore. But now, he'll sometimes seem not bothered, and sometimes he'll act like he still likes me....And this is just making me like him more!!! arghhh      Soo I know how many questions like this are asked, but do you think he still likes me? Or is he playing games? or doesn't he like me anymore? Help :]   (by the way, he doesn't realise that I know that he used to like me) sorry about the long question!!!
20090130171817AAvZLyj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this where I want to be heading?	So things have been weird with me and this guy since the beginning of the school year. The main reason: we knew we liked each other and nothing ever happened us. Now, in January, I'm finally starting to get over him, but the problem is that I'm starting to hate him a little bit too. I've been noticing the things that he does that really bug me, such as being a HUGE flirt, thinking he is just so funny, he can get cocky sometimes. Is going from extreme crush to hating normal? I don't want to hate him, but I think that that is where I am headed with this.
20090130161833AAuL61w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are some attractive women just looking for sex? ?

20090130172409AAg4aHg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Teenager with sex questions?	My school doesn't have sex ed and I'd rather ask you than people I know    1) What brand of condom should I buy, how do I figure out which size to pick and where do you buy them?    2)If it's both your own and the girl's 1st time, do you explain to her that it hurts the first time, (bleeding etc) and do you really worry about whether or not you both have an orgasm?    3)Is it okay to remain inside and continue having sex after I have an orgasm if I'm wearing a condom?    4)(If it isn't okay) Do you pull out even if your wearing a condom, I heard it might slip off, wouldn't grabbing the base and then pulling out stop it from falling off?    5)Last, is a condom enough or should I insist my girlfriend start birth control as well before we have sex? (would it be weird to ask her that)    Thanks    (any other advice, tips, or reminders would be appreciated)

He can be in a bad mood and he becomes happy when I come around. He makes it a point to see me between college classes and we are slowly becoming affectionate but have not kissed yet. We text and talk all day and he admitted he has been checking me out for the last seven months.      He helped me carry my books and didn't mind his friends seeing him do so and after football practice he hugs me for a long time while his team and room mates watch...      He told me he was looking to settle down and stop being like his friends because 24 is too old to be chasing skirts.       I asked him if he saw himself with me > He replied is that a trick question?      What did he mean by that answer? My guy friends said that it meant yes with out being direct..what do you think?

20090130154202AAFQBoG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help with girls!?	I am 19 years of age, still a virgin, but i go to the gym and i have, imo and i have been told, a really nice body cos i've been goin for nearly 2 years. I play for the school football team and basketball team.  I am also told I am among the best lookin boys in my college and girls always call me gorgeous for no reason, when greeting me etc, n i get alot of female attention. Infact, apart from my 2 best mates, all the people i hang out with are really fit girls but we aren't like good mates or anythin so i cant be just a really good friend.   The problem - I am confident around girls and i'm always fliting with girls and I always give out signals to girls making them think I like them and i have to put them down sadly, UNLESS I LIKE THEM. When i like them or find out they like me i get really nervous like they expect something extraordinary to happen. Then there's just a breakdown in communications and it's hard to start conversations. Why is this happening?? why cant I be with them like i am with other girls?? I always hear girls have had crushes or liked me but only after they stopped liking me.
20090130174129AAERL3i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So i gave her a compliment.....?	but i think she might think i'm weird.   i always talk to her and we flirt and she was arguing with her boyfriend about flirting with me and we were on msn and i said she had soft hair because i felt it earlier in the day and she doesnt usually take complements well but this time she said i always lie about that stuff and she called me a weirdo and went offline. why would she do this??
20090130174410AAUQR6I	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this mean? does he like me?	ok theres this popular guy in school and im kinda the opposite of him, im really shy and pretty quiet. for some reason hes always staring at me and sometimes i feel like hes trying to show off in front of me. i ignore him but i think hes trying 2 get my attention. is this just his personality, that hes not used 2 a girl not paying attention 2 him, or that he possibly likes me?
20090130164152AAkGia2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help with a huge crush?!?	Okay, so you may have seen my first question, when I only had the chorus part of my piece done, but now it's finished. So, for those of you that don't know the story, it's basically about me and this guy. And I have liked this guy for two years now, but he doesn't notice me. I sit next to him in a class this year, and I sat next to him in a class last year. We aren't really friends, because I always get so nervous when I talk to him, and somehow, everything I say comes out mean (when I really don't want it to). But anyways, I walked home with him a few times, and I really like him. I can't tell him how I feel, because I will feel like a fool forever, and I will never be able to become friends with him. But anyways, I want some comments and advice on my poem about this situation. All comments and suggestions are welcomed! Enjoy!      Love Never Fails (title)      I remember those mornings,   Gazing into the mirror –   Wondering if I was beautiful enough,   To steal your attention away for a moment.      I remember those mornings,   Taking my seat next to you –   Trying to stay calm,   But nervously shaking within my soul.       I remember those mornings,   Feeling like a failure –   Because I let you slip away again,    Without leaving a piece of myself.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Because love never fails in the end.      I remember those afternoons,   Peering at you from a distance –   Hoping that you would notice me,   And strike your flawless smile my way.       I remember those afternoons,   Searching for you in a crowd –   Of people making their way,    Through the busy hallways.      I remember those afternoons,   Holding back the thoughts of regret –   The thoughts knocking upon my heart,   Because I did not tell you the truth.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Because love never fails in the end.      I remember those evenings,   Looking upon my bedroom ceiling –   Wishing that I was in your thoughts,   And you would stay in my mind forever.      I remember those evenings,   Counting down the seconds –   Until midnight struck,   And then the seconds to dawn.      I remember those evenings,   Crying myself to sleep –   And finding myself in horrible dreams,   Of perpetual misery and loneliness.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Because love never fails in the end.         So, that's it. And by the way, this is all based on my feelings towards him, and it's all true. Thanks for all comments and suggestions! <3
20090130170923AAkwMKh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i tell my ex i still like him?	He broke up with me a couple weeks ago and last week he said he still likes me.      He broke it off because we have nothing in common.      I believe that if i tell him that people that have nothing in common still stay in a relationship, but they eventually find things in common.      What do i tell him and how do i tell him?
20090130174907AAbOFxN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend problem? please helpp!?	i have like 2 best friendds and theyy alwayys go over each others house but never   invite me .. i feel left out. r theyy really my friends? should i still be there friends ?  and about 2 dayys ago, theyy stopped being friendds with my other friends and they  said that if i still be friend with them i wont be THERE friends anymore :( i really need  advice...
20090130165015AAxdKzT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell when shy guy is comfortable around you?	ANd is still interested.   There this guy who used to be really nervous around me....but he isn't anymore. Now I am a little scared that he isn't interested in me. How can I tell if this previously SHY guy is still interested, and simply comfortable. He talked to me like any other person today, but I think we had prolonged eye contact. He was able to look me in the eye....but... I get the impression he lost interest? I can't tell if he is staring at me anymore as he sits behind me and to turn around in the classroom. Now it's reversed, I'm shy around him. His pupils didn't dilate when I talked to him. He's making me nervous because he isn't nervous (of course I haven't done anything to cause him further anxiety, but knowing he was nervous was a sign of interest). Tell me how you feel now.      And how would you feel if / or has your mind changed when:   I think he overheard me saying I go to the gym everday; the next week I bumped into him there. The problem is that he doesn't know when I go to the gym, so is it coincidence? And when I was working out he didn't say hi to me or anything, I said hi to him. At the same time, he isn't usually at the gym. That I know of....         He doesn't know my timetable very well. So he wouldn't have known when i work out... but this is the first time I've seen him in my regular gym time.      I emailed him to ask him a question (the only acquaintance in my class) and he didn't respond to my email but did respond in person when I met him in the gym.      Another weird thing happened.  He handed me surveys I was collecting and I smiled and said "thank you"...he says "thank you" back???  What kind of etiquette is this?

Okay sooo since i just turned 13 my godmother wants me 2 spend the weekend at her apartment in Harlem which is gonna b sooo much fun but i have one big problem.

Well the problem is, Maceo is always touching me. NOT IN THAT WAY, but like saying, " ohhh tasheana your hair is soo pretty" and then like stroking my hair." oooo there is something on your leg" and then touching my leg. Ohhh and last time i saw him, i was with my mother at church, he kept doing the " ohhh im so tired" and streaching his hand over my shoulder{ o sooo corney} my mother kept pushing his hand away and still he wasn't getting it. When i talked 2 my mom she was pissed at me 4 not saying something 2 him and doesn't want me to go to my godmothers house bcuz she knows that he'll b there.       EVERYONE KNOWS I'M LOUD AND KRAZY AND  IF IT WAS ANY OTHER PERSON I WOULD HAVE ALREADY TOLD THEM OFF, BUT SINCE I KNOW HOW EMIOTIONAL HE IS, I DON'T WANT 2 HURT HIS FEELINGS.          WHAT SHOULD I DO,   TELL HIM OFF, AND BREAK HIS FINGERS    OR B KIND AND TELL HIM 2 BACK OFF         RIGHT NOW BREAKING HIS FINGERS SOUNDS REALLY GOOD 2 ME                  WHAT SHOULD I DO???????

20090130161557AAJEhgH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I handle this strange relationship dynamic?	My friend came over the other day, and nicked a couple beers from my fridge. I wasn't to pissed about it, since I'll sometimes do the same type of thing when I'm at his place. I was a little annoyed, but he told me about it and apologized, so it was ok.       What he didn't know is that it was my girlfriends beer, and she had left it there. I apologized and offered to replace it for her, but she isn't having any of it. She seems pissed off that I'm not more angry about it than I am. She wants me to confront the friend, and went as far as to suggest that I punch him in the face!?      She doesn't want me to hit him anymore, but she is still angry that I'm being so layed back about it.       How do I handle this? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I feel like she's being very unreasonable? This is a ten year old friendship we're talking about, and I've known her for just under two.        How should I handle this?

20090130165135AAr1Dnn	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I help my friend break her habit?	She confessed to me the other day that she is "addicted" to reading others' emails.   It isn't normal at all...she has figured out the password to her boyfriend's email account, his ex girlfriend's (who she has never even met), her boyfriend's sister's email,  and even her ex boyfriend's new girlfriend's email!!   I couldn't believe it and told her that isn't normal...and kind of weird.   And she said she has trouble stopping herself from snooping through their email's everyday.   I know looking at a boyfriend's email isn't okay, but it is more understandable than looking at someone's email account that she has never even met!   What do you think of this?
20090130162818AADuLmQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, why would you act like this?	I had a crush on a guy friend. I didn't know if the feeling was mutual until one day as I was walking away from him he grabbed my hand and pulled me close (btw this was in public and in front of about 100 people). Then the next time I saw him he held my hand and interlocked fingers with me. Then we were both on break from school for 2 weeks so we talked online. He finally asked me out to the movies. At the movies he didn't make ANY moves! No hand holding, no kissing, nothing. His hand would get closer to mine but then he would pull it back. And when we talked, he would get all red and nervous. Why would a confident and assertive guy become so shy all of the sudden?   I thought we had broken the physical barrier, so why is he so shy now?

She;s really cool but I've never even thought about being more with her. I asked another girl out to the movies yesterday as a casual date and now my friend seems hurt. She said it was because I didn't tell her and she just thought I didn't trust her but she isn't one of those girls who does that. She's usual laid back and now I'm wondering if she was hurt because she liked me? I feel so bad now. I told her a few weeks back that dating friends is a bad idea from my past experience so could that be the reason she wouldn't tell me how she felt? How do I deal with this? My friend is a really good person and I never want to hurt her. I don't even want to go for this other girl if it bothers her. What do I tell her to make her better? Do any other guys get this problem too?

I never went over her house or anything. and she can't come over here to sleep because there was a family prob. from my last sleepover and i text her what happened and her mom read the text (it wasn't safe) but now its fixed and her mom said no but she said if her mom knew me better then she might have said yes. i mean shes really nice, she's in all my classes and all but im iffy about it, and my dad kinda is too. i like her dad hes nice but her mom is weird. like im just iffy i guess because i don't know what to expect. and i'd rather it be over my house but i don't know. so should I go or should I fake sick because she knows i haven't been feeling good. thanks !

20090130154553AAubyuf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend using me for MOnEy! Pleaseee HelP!!?	I love my boyfriend very much. and i know he loves me too. Well we've been going out for almost 5 months now, and recently i started to realize he's using me for my money or i'm just blinded by his love. Now when i think about it and put the pieces together, it all makes sense.       Well when we first started dating, i remember me and him being in a store together.. i was buying some stuff for my hair and i saw him buying some stuff for his ipod. i wasn't expecting him to pay for my stuff neither did I expected me to pay for his.. but anyways he went to the Register and didn't had enough money so i had to pay for everything!      ANyways a few days ago, we was in a pizza restuarant after school.. i wasn't hungry that day, so i order just two things which came up probably less than $5... he order a lot of things which came up probably over $10... he made sure we order together.. and at the register i didn't had any small change so i hand the cashier a $10 bill and he only put $6.. and everything together came up about $16... and what did you think happened>>> i didn't get back  my change which means i payed for his stuff too!      anyways two days later, the two of us and his friends were at the mall eating center. i saw he and his friend at subway talking, while i was at wendys ordering my stuff.. Then they both walk towards me and he said "baby want me to pay for your stuff?" and i said no..and when i glance at him.. I saw him look at his friend..      I'm  really confused with this guy. i really love him. even at the movies i pay for my own things, and i didn't even realize i was accually doing it. I have high values and goals about being an "independent woman".. but my 2 best friends says he might be taking advantage over me and  my money.. what do u think? i really need your thoughts on this. THankz

20070224050107AA6dFj8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was it right of my fiancee to teach me a lesson by making me jealous?	2 months ago I asked my fiancee for time apart; things were moving fast, marriage was coming, and I thought I needed to think alone. She was very upset, but I insisted and didnt see her for a month. I realized how much I loved and I asked her to take me back. At first she was still angry at me and she was dating someone else but broke that off after 1 week. She forgave me and we are happly engaged again. Recently I found out that she had sex with the other guy before she took me back. She says she wanted to have sex and she was free to so. She also said the guy was very sweet and she was the one who had made the decision. She told him she would go back to me, and that he coud have one night only. We have talked about how she was hurt, and also about the sex we are back in love and my heart knows she is the one, but it bothers me that she admits she also wanted to teach me a lesson for hurting her so bad, and I wonder if it was right of her to make me feel jealous... but should I ??

Don't you think if they liked me enough they would at least say hello?
20090130155214AA6zfNr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	:( show my girlfriend that i love her?	Well i am 15 and   Ive been seing this girl for around 8months now   And im really into her.   We went through some arguments a while back when she thought that our whole relationship was revolving around sex.   However we sorted it.   But now just lately she seems different.. and doesnt seem to be making any effort at all.   She never replies to my texts and instant messages fully   Usually she uses short answers that show no emotion   and she has been making excuses not to see me in the past week.   I really would like to show her how much she means to me as i do not want to lose her. Any help i would appreciate alot. Thanks.

20090130171721AAwurzP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is My ex a jerk or what?	ok so ever since my boyfriend broke up with me I've been trying to get back with him.   So I went up to him today at school and I told him I still have feelings for him and he told me he never liked me and that he doesn't like white girls! (he's white though)   i said then why did you go out with me and he said he did it for a bet!   Omg i was so pissed and sad at the same time!   So i asked him in a sarcastic way "then what type of girls do you like?"   And he said "asian girls they are so hot."   so do you agree hes a jerk and do you think asian girls are hotter than white girls?
20090130155325AA3bwx9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me?	Ok So I know I asked this question before on a different account, but it is a long story something happened and now I can't find the question or my account or anything. Anyways I was wondering if this guy likes me, or if he is just being nice. He and one of his best friends have been hanging around me a lot more lately. Here are some clues on if he might like me or not:      1. We were picking seats to sit in for the month in English class, and he had 2 or 3 options on where to sit, and he sat next to me.   2. Yesterday we had these t-shirts that we had to bring home and when we were at our lockers (his best friends locker is right next to mine) he started doing this funny dance move and he was facing me and we were laughing and I told him to stop (still laughing) and he kept going.   3. One today he came strait up to me instead of his friend and said "Hey do you like my pictures I drew for my story? All I have to do is color them..." and after that he showed them to his friend   4. In drama we are performing A Midsummer Nights Dream. Today we were deciding what parts we wanted to audition for, and my friend said "she wants to be titiana!" and pointed to me. Titiana is the queen of fairies who falls in love with a donkey. Then, like 30 seconds later the guy was like "I call being the donkey!"       Ok so does he like me or is he just being nice? Sorry it is long.

20090130174435AAuMpnQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Go for it on Valentine's Day?	We went to prom last year but didn't really know each other so things were very awkward before and still awkward after (but prom went fine).      She is pretty shy, but she was like avoiding me and being very quiet near me, but my friends thought she probably liked me so i asked her 2 hang out some time over the summer and she said she was hardly gonna be around (i believe that she was busy, but she coulda made time if she really wanted 2).      But I backed off and didn't talk 2 her 4 a while and then started talking 2 her agian but like just as friends and now it isnt awkward anymore. She still hardly ever initiates any conversation but she talks 2 me when i start stuff and it isn't awkward.      I want to go to prom with her again and I was thinking I could ask her out 4 v-day so that i wouldnt have 2 worry about somebody askin her first. But idk if she will freak out if I ask her out again, do you think I should try (i still have 2 weeks)?

20090130174820AAwrX1r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Rate my body plz? no nudity.... 10 points.?	Finally got someones attention. Since you here please answer my question =p      Me and my girlfriend have been going out for about 14 months, but like 2 months ago she said that she is always bored and stuff. Thats when she started hanging around this guy she goes to school with.   At first she would hang out with him with out even telling me because she knew i would get jealous, and she was right. I dont even know this kid, and I hate him because I dont like him taking my spot. My girlfriend is not the slutty type, but a very nice girl, so she wouldnt cheat on me.   Yesterday she wanted to hang out with him to sled instead of doing something with me, but i decide to go over and sled with the two of them. We wait like all day doing nothing for him to show up, but then he gets called to work and doesnt come. So the day is wasted and we didnt do anything but watch tv. Today she decides to spend the entire day with him instead of me, when we didnt have any fun yesterday because of her stupid friend.      Im mad and upset because of this, and she just calls me jealous. Should I be?
20090130175238AAc10h5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this mean i'm weird?	I'm in grade 7,first of all.   I look almost exactly like my avatar.   Okay,so,if walk by a group of girls,they kind of walk away.   Im obsessed with scorpions and feel like sharing their sheer awesomeness with the world..when they slowly back off :/   I hate girly clothes,i'd rather wear my dad's old soccer shirts,whle others are wearing..glittery..pink..stuff.   When i was 10 (only 2 years ago!) i have NEVER heard of Brad Pitt, or avril lavigne or however u spell it.   I still dont know alot of things that weird out a lot of people.   For example,the class was singing Unwritten by..Something beddginfield.I was teh only one who has never,ever heard of it.   And finally,Im the only one in my entire class who has never   a)Gone out with something(or those mini dates at recess)   b) had a relationship   c) and because of a and b,never kissed a guy.   Does this make me weird/socially awkward? Should i change? :<

20090130155110AAuLnXP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	URGENT!!!! How long is too long...?	I've been in an LDR (long distance relationship) for 6 years now and I think it may have run its course. I've gotten to the point where I feel completely isolated and lonely 90% of the time. When we do see each other it seems so surreal that I don't even engage in whatever we do together. The long distance has made me bitter and turned him into a person I don't like. I feel like he doesn't support me like he should (he's overly analytical), he disregards my feelings (because they're invalid), and he talks for me or about me when I'm with him as if I'm not there. I use to love our relationship because I thought he saw me and I thought I was getting to know him. I love you him, but I can't take the distance anymore and I'm not sure if the relationship is worth me moving to where he is...what do you guys think?
20090130160652AA7omPA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask him?????????	Do you think I should ask this guy out? We talk ALOT!  We always make eachother laugh.

What do you think???

20090130173653AAQqckR	Family & Relationships;Family	Parents taking cell phone away, need arguments against it. (I have many good ones already)?	My mom and dad are considering taking my cell phone away, so I've decided to present my case in a formal persuasive essay.   Here's a little bit of background:    Last billing month(Dec 21- Jan 21) I used 7000 texts, and they think that's ridiculous.   So here are my arguments:   1.) Most of the time period was over a school break, and I was without a computer, so my cell phone was my only form of communication with my friends.   2.) I had over 1,000 more messages recieved than message sent, which shows some degree of limitation on my part by not answering them.   3.) I maintain a 4.0 Grade point average, 1st chair in band, and do winter and fall sports, clearly texting does not affect that.   4.) I am without a FaceBook or Myspace, and offered those up as alternatives to texting (Quickly shot down -- My parents hate those)   5.) I compared my texting to their emails, noting that emails take more time to compose, whereas text messages are generally snippets of information.   6.) I may note that I don't text while I drive, or while I'm at school.      Any other ideas? My parents are unwilling to hear my reasoning and I may need more to convince them that I am in the right.   Thanks.

20070227193313AAajqX6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make him choose me over her?	My bf dumped me after I found out he was having an affair with his friend. I begged him to stay with me but he said he cannot forget that girl. 3 weeks after the break up, he called me and said he missed me. From that on until today, we have never lost touch, we see each other often, we go to work together, we play sports together, I even visit his parents almost every week. I asked him once, if his current gf knows about our close friendship and he said no. I feel like he still loves me but he doesn't wanna choose. Like he loves us both equally but he doesn't wanna lose either of us. Am I being stupid by sticking around?      FYI, I feel so comfortable with him in every activity that we do. Be it sports, games, movies, having pets and our arguments are never silly. I love him and sometimes I pray hard that someday he will come to his senses and choose me instead of her. But then again, fairy tale ending are not easy to get. Is he worth the wait? I seem to lose interest in other guys.

20070303232955AApy1g3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How did my perfect love turn into heartbreak? :(?	I dont understand how this happened. My bf and I were in love (or so he told me he was in love with me). But all of a sudden he just started to ignore me and push me aside, when I would try to talk to him about it he would start fights with me and yell at me. He pushed me to the point that I would have anxiety attacks and he KNEW I was having them, but he didn't change his behaviour. So I broke up with him.      After our breakup, I missed him so much that I wanted to work things out but he told me he didnt want to work things out. Turns out he pushed me away because he was scared of committing to me. Instead of just telling me that he wanted to end the relationship, he pushed me so far off the edge till I ended it for him, and now he wont take me back. I dont understand how this happened, everything seemed so perfect at first and all of a sudden it just went astray.      The worst part is I still miss him to death :( How did this happen and what do I do?

20090130163017AAiDcN0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the best way to talk with girls?	I seem to have this problem with girls. I'm a junior at my high school, but I do not, and haven't really try to interact with girls. I say "hello" and "goodbye," the basic things, but I never have had a serious or deep conversation with a girl. This may sound as a blessing for some people, but I feel that I am left out. A whole realm of different opinions held by girls that I will not hear... On top of that,  I have never kissed a girl, hold a girl's hand or done anything that could be consider affectionate with a girl. I know I still have time to accomplish my "firsts." Yet...I feel if I'm given the same advice by everyone in the yahoo community, it won't help me. You guys tend to give bad sappy advice that on the surface seems helpful, but really isn't. The only thing I can do is ignore bad advice. So...I need real answers to how I could have a real conversation with a girl. They don't need to lead anywhere in particular. I know everybody wants his first kiss or even first outing to be special and I concur. But, I feel that having a simple conversation with the opposite-sex is just as satisfying as any of those other things.      What's the best way to talk with girls?

20090130170014AAkqGzi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend broke up with me but my lover wants to meet for sex, I don't know what to do?	I had an affair during the end of my abusive relationship to my partner of 3 and a half years. I was devastated when it ended 3 weeks ago, even though. I knew it would end eventually.    The thing is my lover still wants to meet. He says I don't hav to hav sex with him but feel pressurised into doing it when I'm there. I think it stems from the fact I was in an abusive relationship and scared if I didnt do what i was told. I like his company and when he holds me. The sex part is fine, but he wants it all the time like 4 times in one night. It like he using me. I'm using him in a way but more for friendship reasons.    I needed him during my abused past and now for support over my breakup, but I don't know if I should see him. Is it too soon? I dont know how to tell him I just want to talk to him rather than all the sex, but scared he won't wanna see me again. He is a good friend but feel like he only this way because of the free sex.

20090130185208AA7Zw89	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Truly, can i ever get a boyfriend?	I'm like anti-social when it comes to guys i like. I have a hard time talking to other people even around him. I get so awkward when we talk, and usually the conversation will end very fast. I don't feel like i got what it takes. I'll look at him talking and laughing with his friends and think- i'll never get him. Although, i'm not as shy and anti-social in real life. Only he has the power to alienate me. I keep dreaming about dating him, but truly wisomehwhere deep inside i know i never will. I'm the type of girl in your class that sits there quietly, all shy, and not very talkative. Do i have a chance? By the way-he definitely likes me back.
20090130183346AAnHxfY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a miracle or something?	I've liked this guy for- i dont even know how long. The new semester was coming up and i knew he wasn't taking any of the courses i was taking all except for english. There are maybe 5-7 other english classes out as well. Me and my friends all got separated and i miraculously got the english class with him. I was wondering and i kept repeating to myself, what are the chances? I never had him in any classes the previous semester. I thought long and hard about what my chances were with atleast somewhat having something with him this semester. English was the only class we could possibly get together and we did. When i read his name on the class list, i was kind of surprised and kind of not, it seemed very miraculous to me for some reason. Are miracles real? because truly, i don't believe it was a 'coincidence' for some reason deep inside i believe it was a miracle and i wouldnt have gotten him if i wouldnt have liked him and he wouldnt have liked me back. It's just too coicidental. And neither of my friends have him in any of their classes. (I'm in highschool)

20090130185032AA1VS6X	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I get these boys to stop picking on me?	I'm a freshman in high school and there are these two boys, one is a junior and one is a senior. Both of them are real jerks and make fun of me, embarrass me, and do all these really upsetting things. Usually I just shrug it off but today it really got to me...      I've tried telling them to stop, and ignoring them but it doesn't work. I have this tendency to smile or laugh whenever I'm in an awkward or uncomfortable situation and no matter how hard I try I end up smiling, even though I am really upset, so they don't even take me seriously.      I'm not going to a teacher or anything, that would just be baby-ish and unnecessary, but do you think there is anything I can do to stop them? They've been doing this since October and it is starting to take a toll. I can wait till one of them graduates but the other one will still be at school.      p.s. They seriously don't 'like' me. I'm just a joke to them.

It seemed like he liked me too. He would flirt with me and would wait for me by his locker and walk me to class. And we stay up talking till three in the morning like every weekend. He asked if I liked him and I said I hate answering this question! And he said its ok you don't have to your choice. And I said ya like you. And he said like like? And I said well ya. And he said I don't know what to say. And I said this is why I hate this subject it makes things awkward. And he said Idk if i like like you yet but i do like you. And I stopped talking to him at school cause now whever I get near him I get so nervous my stomach is sick. But we still talk to eachother till three in the morning and just text. And he still flirts and teases me. And he isn't really like that to any other girls. But idk if he is just trying to be nice to me cause he feels bad or if he really does like me. All during lunch we sit at different tables and just smile at eachother and everytime I see him he just smiles at me. And he will stall when he is talking to his friends till I come by and then he and his friends will just walk behind me. Or if he is walking infront of me he will turn around every few seconds and smile at me. PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME I DON"T KNOW WEATHER HE DOES REALLY LIKE ME OR IF HE IS JUST BEING NICE!!!!
20090130191439AAidMI4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IS THERE TRULY SOMEONE OUT THERE FOR EVERYONE?	Ok so I cant stop thinking about my ex. Well I think I still cant get over him. Its like everything i do or everywhere i go he is at the back of my mind. I think I still like him, but i dont know what to do. Well when we were going out he did not treat me that well when he was with his friends.. and deep down i dont think I was happy with him either.. and my parents dont want me to go out with him anyways. But I just wonder if i will ever find someone else.. because right now I still only see him. I always think about him non stop... its worse when Im alone or not doing anything. My friends say I deserve better than him and there is better guys out there.. but Im just not convinced yet. Well he does drink, but I honestly dont care. My parents do though. My dad even said i deserve better than him and think I can do better. Is there truly someone out there for eveyone? I would greatly appreciate it if anyone answers! THANKS!

20090130185421AAc802O	Family & Relationships;Family	My husband's father takes no interest in him or our family. Is there anything I can do to help?	I have been married to my husband for almost 4 years. His parents divorced when he was very young, and both of his parents remarried. His mother remarried a wonderful man who my husband calls dad. We see that part of his family often, and they are very involved in our lives.      On the other hand, his biological father (who lives 30 minutes away), takes NO interest in my husband. This year, he didn't call him on his birthday or Christmas. My husband called him on Christmas day, but his "dad" never returned the call.       My husband is not an overly emotional person, but I know it really hurts him. He wants a relationship with his real father, but his dad doesn't seem to be interested, and my husband is tired of always being the one to make an effort.       I'm afraid my husband is close to completely shutting his dad out of his life so that he can avoid further rejection. I want to support him, but I am afraid he will regret this decision. Is there anything I should do to help? Or should I just support whatever decision he makes?
20090130191752AAqZFVC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you go through a heartbreak?	A guy I've liked for about three years told me he didn't want to talk to me at all on AIM.  He didn't know who I was and before I could tell him, he was straight up mean to me.  He didn't want to know me better and it hurt really bad.   I deleted him off facebook and did all that.   But I still can't get over it.   How mean he was and how I was so wrong about him.   How can I get over him?   I keep trying to move on, but thoughts about him keep coming back.

20090130184128AATgNqJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my best friend like me or not?	Does he like me or not? I cant tell! Help!!!!!!?   So....there is this guy who I have been friends with for as long as I can remember. He is a year younger then me and he is finally in my school! At the beginning of this year it was weird but I kind of liked him...but that soon faded since we didn't see one another much. Well, ast week we finally started talking again and I mentioned that we should hang out. He said sure and suggested the movies! We planned the date and he let me pick it.    Then I asked my dad if I could go and he asked if we were dating...   So i text ed him "lol...my dad thinks were dating"   And he texted back "haha no thank you"   So I said " well no one would want to date me anyways" because I felt like an idiot...   and he rreplied. "well probably someone...just not me"   So after a while I felt like he didn't want to go anymore so I said that we didn't But he said that he still really wanted t go and he was thinking that it was going to be just me and him.       I feel like I am getting mixed signals here!      Plus the other night I got a chain letter that said on the 30th I will be kissed by someone who likes me! I do not believe in those things but I find it odd that it said the 30th which is the day we are going to the movies!      I need help reading the signs...i never really had a bf bbeforeand I don't know if he likes me or not! My friends can not even tell!       HELP!!      Idk if i like him or not! I dont want to like him and have him not like me or vice versa.......      Then he sent me a text that said "youve been blown an early valentines kiss"      I just got back from the movies and we had a lot of fun.... i just wish he would stop making comments about how he isnt dating me.      My dad brought us home and my ad asked him if he told his parents that we went out and he responded "i dont lie" meaning he wasnt dating me.      I could have done w/o that comment!   He is like my bet friend but a part of me is starting to like him!   It is not like I want to!   What should I do???

Stop It, I'm Almost A Man      Let me be clear, so you understand   I'm not like you, I'm not the same man   You influenced me, for most of my life   The impact you had, made me pick up this knife      I grew fond of it's look, and of it's sharpness   I left the sunshine, and entered the darkness   This isn't my fault, but you made me believe   That you weren't the one, who tried to deceive      You thought I was wrong in all that I did   But honestly dad, who are you trying to kid   I wasn't wrong, for the wrong one was you   After all this time, what'd you expect me to do      I got up and ran, swore to never come back   Then I returned, hoping to find the right track   Sadly I didn't I got undoubtedly lost   I found my way back at a terrible cost      My mom was crying when I walked in the room   I said, “Should I go, not come back so soon?”   She replied, “Stay for a moment, you've got to know.”   “Your dad is abusive, we've got to get up and go.”      I didn't believe, the words that she said   I knew he was strict, I thought it was all in my head   She said, “No it's not normal, to act like he does.”   He thinks he is fine, but he's not who he was      He's on medication, I think he's addicted   Come on mom, this joke must be scripted?   This isn't a joke, I swear it's no lie   That's why I'm here, that's why I cry      A week or so later, after threatening to leave   My mom warmed up to my dad, he made her believe   He said it was over, all the madness and yelling   I knew in my soul, there was something no one was telling      I figured it out, this has happened before   But we swept it under the rug, then out of the door   My brother was angry, but that didn't matter   He said life goes on, we've got to keep climbing the ladder      My dad promised, that he'd never hit him again   Well that was a lie, for it wasn't the end   He hit him real good, and caused him to shout   “I gave you the benefit of the doubt.”      I refuse to fail and make his mistake   But the will that I have is starting to break   I want to leave, this place you call home   It feels like a prison, as you may know      What should I do, when my mom sides with my dad   Trying to take, what I have wanted so bad   I've got to escape, I've just got to break free   I've got to do something, for no one, but me      I put others first, too long it has been   If I had the choice I wouldn't do it again   I went to a therapist, on my dad's given order   The session was two hours, I wish it were shorter      They heard all my thoughts, my mom's thoughts too   They didn't hear my dad's, but woop-dee, do   My brother's in college, so my mom had to let go   Now it's my turn, but I'm going towards snow       My dad is upset, putting guilt on my plate   I'm going crazy, please get me out of this state   Others agree, they say, for me it is best   My parents don't care about the thoughts of the rest      I'm grinding my teeth, and pulling out hair   I don't understand why nobody cares   I've pleased my parents for most of my life   It's come to this, me with this knife      If they won't let me go, I swear I'll go mad   It's my fault, despite the thoughts of my dad   He keeps bringing up what I said before   “Let's go to Florida, there's so much in store.”      Forget what I said, I just want to return   Don't hold me back, or my fire will burn   The anger within me and starting to rise   If you keep me here I might as well die      Seven months more, won't make up for crap   Two weeks from now, I hope to be back   Continue my life, without you in it   You want my trust, doing good deeds won't win it      Believe me when I say, someday I'll come home   But I need this right now, please let me grow   Things in this state will be up there too   Operations needed, I'll find a way through      My last year is special, rent a limo for prom   I know that ain't happening, so forget it please mom   I don't want to go back, out of spite or of hatred   I want to go home as I have stated      Because this sure as hell, is not my home...

Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.

20090130182106AATvLok	Family & Relationships;Friends	Feeling defeated and don't know what to do...?	I have a group of friends (4, including me) who have been a "crew" since middle school. We're now in college (ages: 20-21) and a lot has changed.      I no longer wish to be close friends with one of the girls because of a lot that has happened (the feeling's mutual) but my other friends still want to be her friend.       So the other day I arranged a gathering with me and my 2 friends, and the girl I don't like showed up!! My friend said that the girl I don't like texted her asking what she was doing tonight & when she told her, the girl just invited herself!      My problem is that I feel like the girl I don't like is now competing with me to try and be closer to my other 2 friends than I am. She always wants to be the best. And you can tell she's being extra because she'll go out of her way and do things just to score points (I guess you can say).      I just feel defeated. I feel like basically letting her "win" because I'm not about to compete over friends. I'm so annoyed and I just don't know what to do. I want her out of my life but I can't because we have mutual friends. I'm just sick of the drama.

20090130191848AAc3ite	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	***Will he CALL me!!!.....?	I was on msn on Monday  and my ex-bf said hi to me. It was Chinese new year so he said happy new year! Then he said "Hope you stay beautiful forever" Was this a compliment? Or a diss? What does it really mean? is he flirting with me? He also said he wants to have dinner with me...He said he wants to see me and we both agreed that next week is a better time for us both. Then he asked for my number on Monday and said he would call me in later on this week. That talk was on Monday, It’s now Friday & he still hasn’t called. I gave my cell # & told him that it doesn’t have caller ID, so if I miss it to try again another time or to text me.  Wednesday night someone called me but I was in the shower & missed it. Since I don’t have caller ID I dunno who it could be, but I have a feeling it was him. Will he call me? Is it bad if he calls me next week?

20090130182547AAxB4Ez	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to tell friends that I don't want to talk about it?	I am depressed about some things going on in my life recently. Things that I'd reather keep to myself, but my parents, my girlfriend, and some of my other friends have noticed my current mood. Personally I wonder how can others read emotions so easily? Anyway, my girlfriend tried to get me to open up to her, but all I said was that I'd rather not talk about it. Wrong answer for her... Friends have been coming up to me and saying things like "hey are you okay, you seem really out of it"... My parents asked my school counselor if she could talk to me (i didn't say anything to her either). I have only been like this for a couple of days and already it's driving me insane. I just don't feel like talking about what's been bugging me lately. Any reccomendations about how i can convince people that I'm just a little low. Everyone else is convinced that I'm having a midlife crisis (I'm 18 so how does that work anyway?).

20090130185256AAubZCx	Family & Relationships;Family	A girl in my class's dad just go out of jail from child rape?	Ok so a girl in my year at school's dad was in jail for 3 years because of child rape, she is going to be 16 next month, he just got out, his sentence ended, it was all over local newspapaers, headlines like ''child rapist freed'' and all that. Im not judging him or the girl or anything like this. Im just concerned about her, last year, she told me her dad was in jail because he did not pay his taxes. i knew the real reason but i didnt say anything, i dont know if the girl actually knows why he was in jail      she went to see him every week, she talked abou that so openly, if she actually knew he was a child rapist, theres no way she would do that.. i think her mother may have lied to her about why he was in jail, my friends think this aswell. i hate the fact that she might not know what he actually did, she is almost 16, i think she deserves to know the truth don't you? i find it hard to believe that she wouldnt know because of newspapers and all that, although her mum could of hide them from her      she has a brother aswell, hes older, he well, er..how to put it nicely? he is a bit..'challenged'?..he doesnt seem to have any idea whatsoever.      i really believe she doesnt know the real reason. dont u think its very unfair though?not telling her? shes old enough and shes makin things worse for herself, by speakin so openly about going to visit him in jail and throwing a welcome home party for him, everybody else judges her and thinks shes retarded to forgive him for something like that...

20090130185643AAwtLIv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when you are TERRIBLY depressed?	And DON'T say you spend time with your boyfriend/girlfriend. My girlfriend broke my heart when she told me she would be leaving to Canada. We're still a couple, and I tried to keep us together. I applied to a Canadian university and tried to convince her to stay. I don't think I can afford to study at Canada and I don't think she will stay only because I ask her to (even when I did stay when she asked me not to move to another country).      I feel betrayed and devastated. I love her and would give everything to keep her with me, but it seems as a pretty hard thing to do. I'm ashamed of myself, but starting to give up hope. I don't want to meet anyone else. She is my life and I don't know what I'll do when she is gone.      My videogame console broke the same day she told me that news (right after it broke, I spoke with her and she told me she would move to Canada). My only PC game (Gears of War) stopped working (it stopped working for EVERYONE in the world o.O apparently because the game expired and the game makers didn't realize thay had set it up to expire it on Jan. 29th 2009). Videogames are the only thing that can get me calmed down.      I am christian and fear that this is a punishment from my God. My girlfriend is buddhist and I disobeyed my God when I became her boyfriend, as she has a different God than mine. I never put too much effort on trying to change her (I always said I would, but I never tried hard enough). I also believe it's a punishment for relying on videogames to distract my mind from my problems instead of facing them. Yes, it sounds lame, but I do rely on videogames a lot.      I can't sleep at nights because I can't stop thinking of my girlfriend. I can't calm myself down. I have anxiety all the time and randomly start crying, even when I'm sorrounded by people and I just try to hide it.      I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried avoiding my girlfriend (I don't speak to her, and when we meet at events I barely even see her) but it just makes me feel guilty. Tomorrow there's this huge event which she's been waiting for 2 years. The last 2 years she's been telling me I MUST go (I don't want to) and I said I would because I want to see her happy. Now she told me she's moving to Canada I don't want to go at all, but I promised her and I can't do that to her. I am afraid I will feel depressed tomorrow at that event and will only ruin her night.      Her parents will be present at that event and they don't accept me as her boyfriend (they don't know me, but they disapprove anyone who isn't asian like them, and I'm hispanic). There isn't much I can do to make her stay. I can't get the support of her family either.      Days seem like an eternity ever since she told me that news. What do I do to sleep at nights? What do I do so that time goes by faster? What do I do to not feel depressed tomorrow night? Don't tell me I must enjoy the time I have left with her. I'm just too hurt right now to even see her in the eyes.

20090130180503AAGhsKl	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does he like me as a friend or not?	So there's this guy that I have every class with. He's been a really good friend of mine. He sits next to me most of the time, especially Spanish class where we can talk. So a week ago my friends were teasing me in front of him saying I like him and I told him "No offense I wouldn't date you because you're too short"      He said I didn't hurt his feelings but I know I did. So in Spanish, next period, I sat next to him and he asked me if I liked him. I said I didn't know and I didn't think so. He said he didn't like me.       Ever since then, he's been talking to me a lot. Today in Spanish he was poking me and was whispering to me. He always says we're just friends, but he's sending me mixed signals... HELP!!!!!

Anyway for yearbook signing he put his number in my yearbook. We started text and talking. We would talk for hours. Then one day i told him that i  used to like and then he hung up and me and didn't talk to me for like ever. He and his friend would smirk at me during passing time.

I told another friend about what he had said, and she thought he may be the player-type and know just wat to say to keep you liking them for an ego-boost or whatever players reasons are. this was the 2nd conversation since i told him i was attracted to him (but i made it clear i didnt LIKE him, im just attracted to him.) but we hadnt seen each other in person in between, so he mustve noticed those things before. I dont want to get myself hurt, so what do u think? is he just observant? is he flirting? being friendly? trying to play me? HELP!!

I weigh 185 lbs and quite toned as in i have visble veins in my biceps and forearm etc but was wondering to what point is muscle ok before it looks unattractive?     Im quite muscular already (lean not bulky) but I dont want to over do it. So would girls go for someone of my height and build or do you prefer less muscle and also am i too tall for some?

20090130191314AAAOKmA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls are you in a relationship?	Ok that was an easy 2 points, but if you want 10 points, you have to answer this: are you in a relationship because you don't want to be single? OR are you with them because you genuinely like/love them. There is chemistry. In case you don't know what chemistry is, chemistry feels like energy going through your body that increases your heart rate and breathing when you are around the guy.

20090130190254AAhAaVQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife don't have Sex with me and i'm about to cheat?	I love my wife and we have no problems in our relationship other than the lack of sex and affection she gives me. I know she's not cheating because i know where she is at every waking day and put her through many tests that she past with flying colors. I'm starting to feel as if i made a mistake and married a woman 10 years older than myself who already beginning to enter menopause.  I dont care what anyone says, sex is very important to a happy lasting relationship and the people who says otherwise is living in fantasy land.      After talking with her about it i am still lucky to get nooky once every menstrual cycle. I told her that she is forcing my curiosity elsewhere but she still continues the same pattern. When we first met she was on fire but 3years her libido drastically reduced itself to just a wittered spark.       My question is. I met someone else and she is in a relationship herself. Her like myself doesn't not have sex with her husband and is attracted to me like i am to her. We understand that we could never be together and are basically using each other to fill a hole that our mates who (who is perfect in all other ways) are home do not fulfill or care to. When you are married should you depend on your wife to dictate whether you feel good or not ? If everything else in the relationship is right but one very important thing and you discussed with your wife who doesnt care to change it so you cheat, is it wrong ? Should i tie my tubes because she has sexual selfishness or should i see my friend on the outside to make myself happy and make my wife happy by not having to bother her for sex ? Please dont tell me to leave my wife because its not going to happen. The good far outweighs the bad and this outside courtship will make it perfect again

And sometimes she will tell me what she thinks and its different from him but shes always like i dont want to take the wrath from him...and i know that is sounds like she is just saying that to make me happy but its not because ive talked her into saying stuff before and then i just feel bad cause i get what i want but then shes left with his sh**.

Then, he gave me his friend's screen name and told me to add him to my buddy list. After I asked him why, all he said was, "Just because. You added me, so why not add somebody else?"

And even before this conversation, I sort of had a crush on his friend. It's been two weeks since the convo, and I want to talk to his friend, but should I, even after it's been so long? Should I talk to him in person or send him an offline message saying who I am and how I got his screen name?   Thanks! I am horrible at this kind of stuff.

20090130192012AAv5iU7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Whats going on between us?	me and my ex has been talking now as friends. we dont talk for weeks at a time, sometimes even months he's always on my mind cus i love him..its been along time since we been together, but i cant help i still love him, its not my fault he broke my heart..suprinsingly. he know im still dissapointed so i dont have the same respect for him after he dissed me out of nowhere. one night he called like crazy and he kept callin for christmas and new years. we stayed on the phone til 5 in the morning sometimes for no reason..he keeps me on the phone while he watches t.v and i say why you just dont let me call back. and he gives me that moaning voice..Nooo. it was daily attention from him night and day and he flirts alot. then out of nowhere he didnt even give me a chance to talk..he said "thats why i cant talk to you cause i get to close to you"under his breath. i thought that was sweet but his voice tone sounded like he was doomed and he left me puzzled. then outta nowhere he stop callin..2 weeks now. our last words was (text) ex: call me later. me:im not callin lol ex: then we fightin, me:why would you fight someone because of that? he says i dont know yet? and then that was it. i understand why he said he was getting too close meaning he's fallin right..but if that was so, and if you was falling for someone how could your feelings be real if you just leave the person?he wasnt even on that subject when he stopped talking everythng was cool he even said call me back but he didnt respond to my last text.,when i responded i dont know why either.

20090130185748AAKI0gM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girld help please, im totally confused?	Ok so. I was walking for class a couple days ago and this girl who ive seen before and think is cute, starts heading back to her dorm. So when we get close, I looked at her of course, and she looked at me, took a sip of her coffee, with a sideways glance, smiled at me. I was like WOAH and smiled back, with butterflies. Now for some reason I feel like she isnt interested because she is too cute to go with a guy like me. Is she interested? I cant stop thinking about that day and I really want to meet her. I feel like something really happened and I dont even know her. Is that normal?      PS. What should I do? I found her facebook but that is creepy
20090130190903AAjcoVg	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I solve this fight with all my friends?	I'm gonna try and keep this simple. My groups of friends is the sort of artsy just normal people, not popular not rejects just normal middle of the heap. So our lunch table is always really crowded so I moved with a few other friends of mine. When a friend from the other table came over to ask us why I told her it was too crowded and then as a sarcastic joke I said so "Go on back to your sucky friends" which I understand that I shouldn't have said this. But then apparently she didn't take it as a joke and reported back to everyone over there that I didn't like them. No it gets worse, there is this one guy who sort of "leads" the rest of us. He really is an egotistical jerk who thinks he's the best thing ever. But the weird thing is that everybody just kind of goes along with it, whatever he does everybody else does too. Apparently though he thought I actually told them they all sucked so he began to hate me. Which of course everybody else all of a sudden did too. Now I'm not even aloud to go near them and at lunch I overhear them talking smack about me! I don't know what to do!!

20090130191936AAWHdJK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need help. I feel awful. Please answer. 10 points..?	Me and my girlfriend have been going out for about 14 months, but like 2 months ago she said that she is always bored and stuff. Thats when she started hanging around this guy she goes to school with.   At first she would hang out with him with out even telling me because she knew i would get jealous, and she was right. I dont even know this kid, and I hate him because I dont like him taking my spot. My girlfriend is not the slutty type, but a very nice girl, so she wouldnt cheat on me.   Yesterday she wanted to hang out with him to sled instead of doing something with me, but i decide to go over and sled with the two of them. We wait like all day doing nothing for him to show up, but then he gets called to work and doesnt come. So the day is wasted and we didnt do anything but watch tv. Today she decides to spend the entire day with him instead of me, when we didnt have any fun yesterday because of her stupid friend. She doesnt hang out with him more than me, but i dont like it anyways      Im mad,upset, and very hurt because of this, and she just calls me jealous. Should I be?

20090130182740AAblvYJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really messed up this time, didn't I?	(I'm in 8th grade just to let you know)   Okay, Tuesday my friend Jacob found out I liked him.   Things have been really messed up these couple of days since then, and I'm convinced it's all my fault. Let me explain:      So Jacob found out I like him, and in band it was really awkward. (Band is the only class we have together.) He wasn't talking to me, and I wasn't talking to him. Yesterday Jacob was having a conversation with my friend Emily. This morning I bugged her to tell me what it was about. So she did. She said that Jacob called me a creep and would never want to go out with me.That really hurt me. I mean I though I could trust him! Why would he say something like that about me? I get depressed easily and he was always there to talk to me when I needed someone. I just can't believe he would say that.    So anyway, Jacob found out that Emily told me and now he's denying it. But why would Emily lie to me? She used to go out with Jacob and SHE was the one that dumped him and she was obviously okay with me liking him. I don't think that Emily would do that to me.      I just don't know who to believe. Emily or Jacob?      But I guess its not really their fault. They're being human. Humans do those kinds of things. The only one to blame is me. It's my fault for existing and creating this mess. *sigh*      And I really appreciate the people who took the time to read all of this.

20090130185233AA68VDt	Family & Relationships;Family	I need a high school graduation gift for my older brother?	My brother is a senior in high school and is graduating this year. I'm a sophomore and I really want to get him a good gift. I know it's in May, but I wan to start early in case I come up with something that takes more time.    We are really close. Like I'm going to miss him so much! I get really sad and sometimes start crying just thinking about it! He and I are the only rooms upstairs, besides the guests and maids room and I get so sad thinking about how quiet it'll be without him! I also love the rides to school in his car in the morning. So that kind of gives you an idea about how close we are.   And as far as the gift goes...money isn't an object. My family is fortunate enough to be really well off and he has an iphone, a nice laptop, a nice car, college paid for, everything for his dorm will be bought. My parents cover everything, literally. He will have access to their bank account in college and not have to work so that he can focus on his studies. I saw many people suggested giving a new desk lamp, or a phone card, etc, but none of that will be necessary in our situation. I want something thoughtful but not a scrapbook. I also don't want to just do a picture of us. Homemade is fine though, as is a picture of us with some type of meaningful decoration or something. And don't need the idea of sending him cookies or whatever in college, I'm already doing that. all the time! I love to bake, he loves my baking, and I'll miss him so much! So that's not really a gift, just something I love to do anyways.    I hope you get my gist. I'm being so specific hoping that this will help you give me some ideas. Anything helpful!

20090130191804AADRJkV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Confused and dissappointed.?	Help me out guys, I am currently in a relationship with a guy with needs, he claims to have emotional disability(he was in special ed in highschool), I didn't like him initially when we met , we were just good friends, but then he kept asking me out and eventually I gave in and said ok coz i didnt want him to feel bad and think that he had issues. He is a great person caring and everything, he is normal but NOT very smart. Im a good student I get A's in all of my classes and I feel like I dont want to be with someone who is a failure in life, he didnt pass his first semester at college and got a gpa of 2.0 while my gpa was 3.93 and  made it to the dean's list. I never saw much of a future with him but I didnt want to hurt him, I thought he would be capable of atleast achieving something in life, but nothing, I doubt he can pursue any occupation.I just found out yesterday he failed his pre-algebra class and didnt even know his tables any of them!! And its ironic cause i am taking Calculus II(doing Pre-med). I'ts just that I dont know what to tell him coz i dont want to hurt him coz of his super sensitiveness and emotional issues, would it be mean for me to break up with him just beacause he is not doing well in college?   I just feel I can deserve better, its not that I am ugly or anything, LOL I have got quite a few modelling offers, ( just to let you knw im not an ugly ***, hah NOT boasting), But i still feel like i lack self confidence and dont value myself too much. Please help me out in this matter. What should I tell him, or should I just stay? I think its too late for him to improve and achieve anything. But i dont want to compromise on my happiness. How can I improve my self confidence? I dont know what's wrong with me, im just too shy and not very outgoing.   Thanks, any help would be greatly appreciated.

20090130180407AALTi9a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In an odd relationship... How will this turn out?	(Before reading this, know that I am a gay male)      I met a guy on the internet... on a forum. He's 14; I'm 16. He lives about 50 minutes from me.      Soon after we met and had been talking on MSN regularly, he decided that he's passionately in love with me, and reminded me (and still does remind me) quite frequently. We met shortly afterward at our local shopping mall... it was sort of awkward for a couple of minutes, but we got used to it. Now (about a month after meeting at the mall), we talk for at least an hour every night on the phone.       He's sort of immature and his interests are pretty much the polar opposites of mine... But he's sweet and sincere. I really do like him, but I think it might just be because he loves me (which I'm told is a bad reason to like someone).      This won't end well, will it?

20090130180850AAO5jAA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to know if was happened to me was rape?	I never really thought about what happened that first time this boy and I had sex two years ago. But I broke it all down and I guess part of me knew it at the time and even weeks later. But I put it out of my mind. I just didn't think about it. I guess I kept having sex with him to justify what happened. Like that first time wasn't wrong. Like if I could make it into a relationship than all that happened was ok. But here's the gist of what happened that night:      I went out pretty late 10pm or so with Tom and his friends. We drank. (I'd just really started drinking that summer in 07) We were hanging out at a pool and everyone decided to go back to a friends house. We went there and drank a bit more. I was told that I could sleep in a spare room. I felt buzzed from all the drinking and went to the bathroom. When I came out Tom was already on the bed I was told I could sleep on. I said "You're sleeping in here?" & he said yes so I made a move to the door and he said we could share the bed and he wouldn't do anything. (I'd shared beds with guy friends who never tried to fool around before.) Anyway I was against the wall with my back to Tom and he spooned me from behind. He'd been trying to kiss me a few times throughout the night and I wouldn't let him. He turned me onto my back and tried to kiss me. I moved my mouth away and he asked me "Don't you like me?" I said yea. Cuz I did. Then I started to tell him that I didn't want to have sex and said no. Tried to push him off of me but he's taller and stronger. He just kept kissing me then put himself in me. Afterward we just went to sleep. I was too drunk to stay awake and was in and out of it while having sex. In the morning he dropped me off at home and asked me if what happened the night before was ok. I said yea. But was it? I'm confused. Plus I had sex with him again a few days later and a couple times in the months that followed.      Can what happened to me be called rape?

(Keep in mind NONE of these friends had ever heard of him let alone talked to him)   Friend 1- Yeah (sarcastic) he's way cute...but I'll bet he's no good. he's probley doing meth "under the bridge" by the way he dresses.   Friend 2- "You haven't got a snowballs chance in hell with him."   Friend 3- "I know his type and he's not worth it."   Friend 4- 'He looks really nice!" (Me) Yeah but like Friend 2 said i havent got a chance." :(   (friend) Don't think like that! We don't know what kind of a person he is just because he looks like one type of person, doesn't mean he is.

From everything i can see hes REALLY nice. Hes not concieted. And hes HOTT!!!!!! Am i wasting my time? Or do i just need knew friends? Please answer honestly if you were in MY position!!!

Sometimes i get caught into his eyes and we just stare into each other eyes then look away after a couple of seconds. He will always try to grab me (in places) and he claims that's to annoy me. I asked him if he liked me and it took him a half hour with leave me alone! to finally get a little no. the next day i saw him he just kept staring at me. He talks to me sometimes not too much. He flirts with my cuzz and while doing that he would glance at me. In public he acts like he doesn't know me. When im with my friends he will always try to listen to what im saying. He doesn't dare to stare at me in front of my friends. Its just in private he stares at me.also, he will always make dumb excuses if he doesn't want me to do something. like for example, i asked if i can play xbox360 with him and he said no cuz im a girl.One more thing he always trys to get on top of me to dry hump me (mostly on bed). im really confused please help me. its been going on for a while and its been getting me confused and frustrated.

Like I could not stand looking at him. Over the last few weeks, I've started to get to know him better. He's a pretty cool guy, I kinda like him, I think he likes me too, but idk. Today, he had on a sweater, I have the same thing and he said "oh, we can wear them one day, we'd match." and then he kept taking pictures of me even when I told him to stop and I was jokingly hitting him and stuff, I was at his computer talking to him, but he isn't one for really serious conversation. After class, I was walking with my friend and we were walking arm in arm, so the guy walked up and I grabbed his arm, and we were walking like that, and then I let go and kept walking, then he started taking pictures of me again, and I hit him and we both laughed. After school I talked to him again for a sec and he started with the damn camera again so I was like I'll see ya monday. I don't know how to tell if he likes me. He needed help with a page, and I helped him. Sometimes he'll come to my computer and talk for a while, usually about YB stuff. Everyday on my way to another class he'll stare at me, but idk why. How can I tell with a guy like this??!?!?! HELP!!

20090130182909AAATqpV	Family & Relationships;Friends	My really good friend just stopped liking me...?	Okay, so I have this really good guy friend and I met him over the summer at a camp, then realized he was going to my school. We got close the first 3 months and people kept telling me he liked me. Then finally he asked me out, but i didn't feel that way about him so i just used the "im not allowed to date" excuse. After that we were still friends, there wasn't much of a difference. Right before winter break I noticed he was ignoring me so I kinda ignored him back not wanting to like get in his face and make him mad at me or something. I didn't know why he was doing this so 2 weeks later I asked him and he said "because you were avoiding me." the next day some people told me that he didnt like me as a friend anymore, and since then we havent talked. and to make it even worse, i cant stop thinking about him. what should i do?

20090130184038AAawti9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think it's normal for most people who smoke pot to really cut back or quit when they're in their 30's?	I was with someone for 10 years and we both smoked marijuana. I was 19 when we got together and didn't think our marijuana use was going to be a "lifestyle" and continue indefinitely. In fact the two of us had discussions in which we talked about how we wouldn't be smoking indefinitely.       I developed severe anxiety and depression, I believe, as a result of the daily marijuana use and quit shortly before conceiving our son. My partner continued to smoke pot and although he said he cut back I could tell he was smoking it more often then he was letting on. He began hiding it and lying about it.       I understand the point that some people make about how I knew he smoked marijuana when we got together and "shouldn't have expected him to change", but I was surprised how much my priorities changed after having our son and couldn't have foreseen the significance of that event in my life and how it affected how I wanted to conduct myself (the type of example I wanted to be).      Anyway, I noticed my ex growing increasingly restless in our relationship, we began arguing more, he said my wanting him to quit smoking marijuana was me just trying to "control" him and he was seemingly fighting for his "freedom". I was alarming how completely resistant he was to quitting marijuana. I think it was then I realized he was psychologically addicted, in my opinion.       He grew distant, we argued and ultimately he ended up leaving the relationship and I discovered he'd been spending time with a 20 year old female coworker (he's 34) and the two had grown close and he was hiding that. He denied anything happened until after he left, saying they only talked and smoked marijuana together.      Is it normal for someone in their mid-thirties to be so resistant to stopping smoking pot when they have a family? Or is a sign of addiction? I'm still having a hard time with the fact that I feel the pot was the breaking point in the relationship for him. We were together for 10 years and had a 2 year old together.      He says he likes living his life that way and had to break free of my wanting to "change him" because I was asking him to quit.

20090130185101AAdsHfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is driving me crazy...?	I have been with this guy for nearly 3 years and living together for 2 1/2. From the start, there have been things that he does that bother me, but I'm an extremely patient and tolerant person and just let these things go. I'm talking things like: leaving his socks on the floor, unplugging my rechargeable razor and toothbrush in my bathroom (we do not share bathrooms), and other such b.s. It annoys the heck out of me, but I truly think there are more important things in life than getting upset over these petty things. He, on the other hand, doesn't let a single thing go. But the problem is that he doesn't say anything to me about what's bugging him - he just stops talking to me for days at a time. When he finally does talk to me about what set him off, I get so frustrated because it's just such stupid things like: I threw my clothes on the floor in my bathroom, I left a few dishes in the sink overnight, I left some trash in the car, I didn't rinse the dishes before I put them in the dishwasher, etc. I can see how this can be annoying, but I can't understand why it would make him so angry that he would choose to just give me the cold shoulder for days on end.     This last time (and the reason I'm writing really) his foul mood lasted for nearly a month. He stopped even acknowledging my presence in the room or would just go elsewhere in the house. He slept in the spare bedroom. He stopped even saying hello/goodbye. When he did talk to me, it was to scold me about something I'd failed to do (like the dishes or the cat box). And his tone of voice was just so condescending and nasty. He was hurtful and petty and immature - all the things I hate in a man and certainly not the kind of behavior I ever expected from him after nearly 3 years together.    Earlier this week, I decided I'd had enough and that I wanted to leave him. I had a long talk with his mom (I'm very close to her actually). She agreed that something seemed very wrong, but she asked me to give him another chance. My terms were that he would have to agree to couples counseling or I would need to leave for my own sanity (because his behavior is a form of abuse for the love of bagels). So I starting making all sorts of plans to set up a new life on my own - went apartment hunting, looked at cars, and got a storage unit so I could start shuttling my things out of his house. The counseling is set up for the end of February, but his mom has yet to tell him about it.    Now, for the last three nights, he has been very nice. Sweet even. And I'm waffling... it is very easy to stay now that he's back to his old self. But how long will this last? What the heck made him so angry to start with that he would treat me like that?! I'm not sure it was anything I did - it could have had nothing to do with me - but then the question is why would he think it was ok to take his frustrations out on me like that?     Should I stay or should I go?

Pot makes you relaxed, mellow, calm etc while he is quite the opposite: uptight, get's pissed off at something completely stupid, yells, screams, threatens us, etc. (Us being my mom and I) So I guess I have two questions:      What else could he possibly be doing? (Meth maybe?)   and   What can I do about it? My mom is too passive and doesn't really do anything. Maybe throw a few words out there and that's it. Is it possible for me, a 16 year old, to get a restraining order on him even though he lives with me?      So what else could he be possibly doing and what an I do about it?

20090130185715AAhh9Iz	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does my best friend want to be in a relationship with me?	I've been friends with a guy since 4th grade and he's been with me through thick and thin. During our last year of high school though things have gotten complicated. His hugs have gotten more affectionate as he will rub my back as he is doing so and has begun to plant kisses and such. He tells people that I'm like his really hot sister when they point out his public displays of affection and I don't know how to interpret that. There was also one time he had come to school under the influence of something (I told him I didn't like it and he stopped), but he had wrapped in his arms and nuzzled? my neck as he said he loved me, my body, and wanted me to have his kids. I don't know if people tell the truth when they are high so I dunno. I did not bring that up to him later and I think he forgot about that. It's been a while and things are still the same. What's going on with him? Please help.
20090130185657AAUTwpV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this a real friend?	he hangs out with me in school and goes home with me, but never attemps to communicate with me after school, like when i'm home or whatever- i always try to call him and contact him first, and when i do, he says he's busy. he also does tacky things like removes me from his top friends on myspace, i also used to do things for him like buy him lunch after school and he never seemed to pay me back in any kind of way, and when i say he's not being a good friend, he says that he is cause i've been to his house and all. but still, i'm guessing that he's pretty much a fake friend, but i'll also use other peoples thoughts on this also. thanks.!

20090130191349AACQ4lA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I stop comparing my self to my boyfriend's ex girlfriends?	I've been with my bf for over 6 months now.  When we first started dating, he told me about his exes.  He dated is first gf for two and a half years and he told me how in love he was and that he wanted to marry her.  Things sort of fell apart towards the end and he was the one to end the relationship.        After this girl, he dated another girl briefly, whom he described as "really hot" and whom he lost his virginity to.  What made insecure is that he told me "She was def not a virgin, she really knew what she was doing".        I can't help comparing myself sexually to this "really hot" girl.  He is my first and I really feel like I can't compare.  I also feel like he will never love me like his first girlfriend, which makes me wonder if this is even worth it.  It's really putting a strain on our relationship because I just feel like I'm never going to be good enough.

20090130192606AAYIyyc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Being on a Break - What does it mean?	I cant believe I am writing this in as forum thing but i just need some advice.   after a year together and following our first proper argument my girlfrind decided she thinks we should go on a break - not to see other people as she said if u met someone else shed kill me (figuratively) but that she doesnt know what shes feeling and is busy with work as am i at the moment,  I have been burned in the past and have only lately begun to realise that shes the love of my life and feel like i may have lost her. she said shed call when shes ready though it could be a week maybe more i dont know!  we have a long distance relationship which doesnt help but ive told her ill do nething to make it work even if that means moving closer.  i feel sick in side and knowi cant call her for a week though i want to but it wouldnt achieve nething - she knows how i feel.  are relationships stronger after a break or is it a sign that its crumbled and she just cant say good bye...she said she hasnt fallen out of love but just doesnt know what shes feeling and doesnt want to lie....advice (and please be kind) because i really care about this girl and have many regrets now of not taking her feelings towards me as seriouly as i shoulkd have mainly because i have only just left uni and didnt know where my jonb would be.  thank you

20090130192828AAeaYEQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is Friendship not lucky for me? please help?	My biggest weakness is, I love everyone in this world(the people whom I know), as I love myself. Some times I seem to be over affectionate.       A a couple of year ago, I was hurt by many of my friends and that made me desperate and I stopped giving importance to friendship but recently I met with a life threatening accident and shocked to see many of my friends(who were not given importance) visited me and they really cared for me a lot.      Again I started making friends again but I noticed that the people I love hurt me a lot. I again faced the same situation. The people who care for me are still there but the one whom I considered to be a close friend has hurt again.      I have decided to become like before and wants to mind my own business.      Is that a correct decision?
20090130204647AAgs2vw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I or Shouldnt I?	Ok, so the father of my kids has a new girlfriend and she has been all over the news..Tyra Banks show, CNN..and local news. She has been calling me, threatening me, and just harrassing me. Well now I see on the news she has been arrested for doing the same thing to her ex's new girlfriend. She is attention starved and now she is posting things on the internet about me and has contacted the media to say she is innocent even though I have police reports and voice & text messages from her. She even shows up at my childrens supervised visitation with their father at the courthouse to fight me. I cant get a restraining order because she hasnt actually physcially attacked me. She is so out of control and she wont go away no matter how long I ignore her. Im not a fighter and I just want to go about my life with my children, but she wont leave us alone. The father of my kids doesnt even visit with the kids anymore (for the past 3 months) so she has NO reason to bother me. Her own boyfriend doesnt even contact me. What should I do? Just leave it alone...or should I fight back via the media.

I seem to have a really hard time finding females that are mature and actually women instead of girls or girls who think its approriate to act like immature guys.  Basically the vast majority of females I have encountered in the work and school environments are not what I would call women (classy, dignified, responsible, mature, feminine, etc...).  Instead they seem to be focused purely on the moment and having fun aka hookups and going out and getting wasted.

20090130203455AAHePF0	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do about a gossipy friend? Long Question.?	I'm in my late 30's. My friend is even older. We've been friends for about 5 years. She's always been a gossip and it always bothered me a little but I believed that she wouldn't gossip about anything which might actually hurt someone.       Back in November I told her something that was deeply embarrassing to me. It might not embarrass some people but it did me. I told her I was very embarrassed about my behavior and thought it reflected poorly on me and that I didn't want anyone to know about it. About 3 days later I ran into a mutual acquaintance who asked me all about that story. He said my friend told him about it.       A week ago my friend told me a horrifying story an acquaintance told her. This is a story of a terrible crime which was committed on this acquaintance. Really terrible, think the worst you could live through and subtract 15%. This is unquestionably not the kind of story anyone would want going around about them. My friend thought nothing of telling me and even said that she was considering writing the story and posting it online (names changed).      I can't trust my friend anymore. I can't talk to her about anything important to me because I know a dozen people will hear about it. I've lost all respect for her because of her gossiping especially the crime story.       Here's the moral question:  Do I have an obligation, as her friend, to talk to her about this and give her the opportunity to mend her ways and possibly heal our friendship? I really don't ever want to look at her again but I think it might be morally wrong not to give her a chance to try to change.      Sorry for the length. Thanks for reading all this.

I really want to tell her how I feel just to get it out of me. We used to talk online everyday, but now we never talk anymore. I think she "blocked" me on msn messenger. Should I just go talk to her and tell her that I don't expect her to say anything and just tell her? Could I do it online or is that a big mistake? Please give me your advice, I really need help.      Also, what should I tell her? How should I ask her to talk to her? She's always surrounded by friends, so how can I ask her to talk to her without making it too obvious? Please write as much as you can to help me, I really need help.

And also I'm a bit afraid.. like, I don't know how and when to tell him.      What should I do?   I'm shy.

20090130194614AAXYRc2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	CAN A HAIRCUT CHANGE YOUR FEELINGS FOR YOUR 'CRUSH'? OMG!!!!!!?	This guy i liked for maybe years, just shaved his hair so short that i can barely stand to even look at him anymore. He usually cuts his hair little by little, but this time, he just shaved it all off, almost completely bald. I was wondering wheher he's gone mad. It makes me wonder how i ever even liked him. I dont know if i'm exagerating, but the haircut looks really bad on him. You can see his all his pimples and his strangely shaped convex shaped head, it's so weird. I just can't get used to it. I fantasized kissing him before, then when he showed up to school with his shaved head, i almost got a heart attack. Now i'm not even flattered when i see him looking at me, it just kind of freaks me out. Oh my gosh, am i the only one thats ever felt this way? OMG!!!!
20090130200209AA5miAb	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why are brides so mean to their moh or bm if they become pregnant? ?	I was out shopping today, and I sat down to get a drink before I continued. There was a young woman sitting at the next table crying her eyes out. Her husband was comforting her as best as he could, but this young lady was really upset. So I reached into my purse,and grabbed some tissues and handed it to the young woman. She politely said thank you. Her husband left to get her a drink and I asked the young woman what was wrong.       She said that her sister had just yelled at her in front of her whole family, because she announced at a family get together that she's expecting twins in july. Her sister is getting married in June.  Well her sister told her she's going to be to fat and ugly to be in "HER" wedding. The young woman was told she would NEVER be able to have any children. These babies are a miracle! I told her don't let her sisters attitude bother her. She's going to have to deal with being pregnant, and delivering her babies in the summer. We chatted a bit more before her husband, came back. By this time I had her smiling and laughing a bit with stories about my own pregnancies, and my children.       So my question to those of you who have experienced this. Why are some brides nasty to their MOH or BM if they become pregnant? Regardless if the pregnancy is planned or unplanned.

20090130192752AADeM3G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I HATE THAT I LOVE HIM!!?	I'm scared of commitment because the last one I was in left me with stitches in my face...The only friend I have is a guy who is in love with another woman he doesn't even talk to and I'm in love with him because he treats me so well...our 5 month friendship resembles a relationship but both of us have told the other that we dont want relationships...I have emotional and physical scars from a previous and can barely handle the feelings I have for him let alone a committment. I think that If I dont get rid of these feelings that he doesn't share with me, I will not want to be friends anymore as my heart will hurt. How do I get over him when he's the only reliable person in my life (I lost all my friends and half my family when I was in my past relationship)? I've met new people but everyone I've met so far have shown me how big of jerks they are.      Please dont say "be with him"...we dont share the same feelings as I have told him everything that I have told yall. The conversation ended and our interaction has continued on the same path. Nothing has changed for better or for worse...plus...even if he would be in a relationship, I'm too scared of being emotionally and physically hurt again to function right

20090130205510AA6yy5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend/friend help?	Ok so there's this guy that I am totally in love with and he is in love with me too. We've known each other since we were 2, but we didn't start liking each other more than friends until about October 2008. He went to my school, but he left to be home-schooled today. I am really sad. He is excited to be home-schooled but he says he will really miss me. We are always flirting and we are perfect for each other.... But we won't get to see each other that often because his parents are concerned about him. He does not get the best grades (that's why they are trying to home-school him) and they really want to focus. Our parents are good friends, but his parents told my parents that he just doesn't have time for a girlfriend and that he has to keep his focus in school. But he doesn't care about school, he cares about me and water polo (he is on the first place team 14 and under for the USA, so that is a priority). His parents keep interfering with our relationship and I'm just scared that I will lose him until we're really old enough to date. Any advice? PLEASE HELP ME. I love him, he loves me, but his parents are starting to really get on our nerves.
20090130203800AAYWysL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Would you mind if your MOH were to sew her own dress for your wedding?	I am my FSIL's MOH, but I really can't afford a fancy-schmancy dress that I will only be able to wear a handful of times. I was thinking of saving myself some money by sewing my own dress (I have sewn dresses before). My FSIL doesn't really care about what the dress looks like, she just wants it to be black, with no embellishment and floor length. The wedding is also relatively laid-back.   So what do you think of this? (Be sure the scroll down to see all of the pictures of the different ways the dress can be worn)  http://rowena.typepad.com/rostitchery/in...  I am planning on making the skirt long for the wedding and maybe hemming it up after the wedding for an everyday dress. I am, of course, going to ask my FSIL, but I wanted other opinions. (**Just to add so people get the pictures. The dress is an "infinity dress" because there are so many different ways that you can wear the same dress.)  Would you mind your MOH or BM making/wearing something like this for your wedding?
20090130204802AAda0UO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do guys think of a confident, determine, and yet kind of mysterious  girl?	I just started school at a university.  and I am starting to notice     some girls dont like me or become intimated by me.      (Maybe my personality, I used to be a shoes salesperson and I not afraid of approaching tutors/ professor/people for help if I dont understand. I think some of the girls that get help at the  tutor center  ddon't like that  tutors really take their time to help me understand but that because I am nice and do care to ask about them too (my customer service side of me)       Anyways,  I want to know more of  what guys think of me. Especially because I plan to go into construction management.  I usually don't talk to a lot of people in class (class size = 90-600 students). I do ask question in class when  I don't understand. Anyways,  I am starting to notice a lot of guys noticing me from my construction class & weight room but are afraid to talk to me and be my friends.       I want to know if the way I carried myself is the reason I am not making a lot of friends. When I do talk to guys they want to hit on me!      It just so different at the university ( I used to be on Student Government at my Community College and see a bunch of people everyday, now it like barely anyone I know or anyone to talk to).    I dont want to come off as a guy or extra girly, because that just not me. I am just the quiet, determine, focus, and confident.             Well anyways, in general I want to know of what do guys think of me with my personality?   How do I not give a damn of what other people think of me and why the heck do people get jealous at me for being nice to others?   How do I make friends with guys without having them hitting me?
20090130194538AAHu8oF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I overreacting or does your boyfriend do this too?	I'm in a jealous relationship, and before you jump down my throat for that, I don't need your advice with that. It's long distance and it's expected.    Now my boyfriend is jealous, and I avoid becoming friends with guys whom might strike him as jerks or not the kind of guy he'd be friends with, and even at that rate, I still avoid some just to minimize the jealousy.    My boyfriend's best friend is a girl. He's out to a concert tonight with her after I assured him I would be fine. Which I was, until I saw her message to him on facebook.    At 3 in the morning, she decides to message him and say "You're my best friend ever. I love you so much." Am I wrong to get INSANELY jealous by having her say that? She knows about our jealousy issues because he goes to her for things about our relationship. So is that just total disrespect to me when she knows how I am?
20090130205731AAqs6Fh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I try not to but every time I see this girl I basically swoon?	I met a girl through friends over the summer and immediately was smitten. It was just an innocent crush and I've had far too many of those (and being a girl liking a girl doesn't make it easier) so I try to forget about it. The way we know each other through friends is one of those 'small world' kind of things, so we talked a lot to each other marveling over it for a few months, on Facebook. She got my number from someone, and we started texting. We hung out a second time with a group of friends, but this time I didn't make a very good impression - but she didn't think anything bad about me even after it. Every chance she gets she texts me or calls me or leaves me Facebook messages and she 'poked' me on Facebook, too. I was thrilled at the time, but, again, I pushed this crush aside. Her chattiness hasn't worn off. Each time she texts me is a new thrill. I can't understand why she does this.      I saw her tonight for the third time since summer but this time I gave her a better impression - I was outgoing and bubbly and I could tell she liked it much more than the last time. The moment she saw me (we went to a concert of hers, and afterwards she came out from behind the stage to greet everyone) she squealed my name and gave me a hug - before she even said hi to her friends. During the whole concert I just adored her and I almost don't WANT to because I know it will end badly. We talked for a half hour afterwards, close-talking (I'm a close talker) and always touching...our hands, our arms. I don't think I lost physical contact with her for a whole half hour, but neither did she. I'm so confused and I know I should ask her but I just can't and I don't know what to do. What do you think?

Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to.

We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np.

One of my friends (varsity wrestler) was all depressed this week wining that is harm hurt like heck, and he lost his girl who's older than us, and blah blah blah, I felt sorry for him for a time, but it's getting closer to valentines day and I'm getting more ticked off (I hate valentines day) and he just keeps on complaining when I have been single for about a year and a half, I have the feeling that not a single girl likes me more than a friend, I'm a cool guy, I play guitar and bass guitar, I'm lead vocals in my band, I'm a genius when it comes to computers, and I'm 5 ft. 4.5 in. and I'm a nice guy. Why the heck can't I get a gf      I've subscribed to David DeAngleo's email newsletter, and i've tried different techniques but still no results. THIS WHOLE THING IS TARING ME APART!

20090130201225AAsOGQC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, was this a cute way to apologize?	So I am sixteen, and my girlfriend has been mad at me for about a week now. She's quiet and has a very sweet personality (she's also one of those preppy kinds of girls, lol). I had been going through a lot of stress lately and I finally lost it and she was, unfortunately, the recipient of that repressed stress. Anyway, she had been pretty pissed at me but her friends had told me that, as of late, she had missed spending time with me. I wanted to do something cute to apologize, so here's what I did: I bought a small stuffed animal, taped a note to one of its paws which read: The guy who bought me is really sorry. I think he's a jerk, but he really wants you to forgive him, and left it inside her locker on Wednesday. I haven't recieved any calls from her yet, but: A) was this a cute way to apologize and b) more importantly,  do you think she will forgive me?

Im a 17 year old guy im about to turn 18 next month. And lately all the thoughts and pressures of graduating high school is starting to built on me. So i try not to think about prom night and all those things that come with it. but when i do one in particular... like A girl to go wit, the way i fell is that if i don't find a girl to take then... ill just save myself the embarrassment and not go at all. But then again Me being me and the way that i feel is that i really don't feel the excitement and want to go to prom. I try really hard to see myself at prom wit a Beautiful girl but i cant. I Dont want to go and i dont see why its such a big deal. Please understand that i dont see myself like most high school students. But the reason i type this matter is because i have brothers and sisters that gave already graduated and wenrt to prom and they always talk about me going and how they want to see me dressed and they want me to have fun and all that stuff. I see it as them just trying to make sure i have fun my last year. i apperciate that but i just dont see myself that way. Please understand that im different just like everyone else. And ill rather be alone on prom night somewhere.

I'm fine when someone tells me I'm a good worker or that I look nice (what I'm wearing) But... a lot of times I get complimented on my butt.   Seriously and I'm not being egotistical. I don't purposely wear tighter pants, but I do get from co-workers how hot my behind is. I turn red and embarrassed which causes them to say it even more.

20090130192832AAzrcFt	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel a bit offended, please keep reading and tell me what you think...?	My sister is 45 and living with a man who is 64! Okay, well, he's freshly a widower, his wife was in a home because a few years ago he pushed her down the steps in the home and caused her serious complications, she had a stroke and was never able to tell on him. This is a known fact, he even told it, his kids that are now grown up know this too. Anyway, his wife died the day after Christmas, December 26th. While she was in the nursing home, he started up with my sister, and my sister moved in with him. She knows what he did, yet stays with the jerk, that's also the age of our own parents!  Okay, now he's trying to force my sister into marriage, like immediately. He's planning a February 14th marriage to my sister. This man knows how I feel about him, and he also knows that date is also my son's birthday. I feel pretty offended that he chose that date. I honestly have no good for him, and if he never married into our family, that would be great, but on my son't birthday of all days???? Is this deliberate? My sister also saw him writing out a tax paper, he had HER name listed on it as his fiance. He wants her tax w-2 and he wants to file on her too. I think this is a part of why he's pushing so hard to marry her as well, to take her tax money. Needless to say, I don't trust him one earthly bit either, I wish she'd leave him but my sister is not the smartest needle in the haystack either, she's very gullible, which is a part of why she's divorced from her first and only husband right now. How would you feel about all of this? I'm very mad that this jerk wants to do this on Valentines day, also knowing it's my son's birthday and I dislike him, and makes me even more ticked off that he thinks I'm too stupid to see what he's trying to do. What would you do? Anything? How would you feel about all of this if it were your sister? Your son't birthday?
20090130195317AA63iA4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he really love me NOW? ?	My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over two months. After the first week of our relationship he told me he loved me. I was shocked and a little annoyed because I knew he couldn't possibly be in love after one week. He told me he loved me every time we talked since then. Now after two months I fell for him and can honestly say I love him. But I still can't take him seriously when he says it to me. I don't think he knows what true love is. It hurts thinking how true my feelings are when he threw the word out so fast. I feel like he can find "love" with anybody. Is there a possibility that he truly loves me now? I don't know

20090130203616AAAwq6G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is she so weird with me now? did i make a mistake? ?	ok so my best friend at school and also my crush has been really weird these past weeks.i am 14 and started school being new on august. so i really didnt talk at all to her for 2 months because i didnt know her, i am also VERY shy and to be friends with a girl they usually start talking to me. so she actually talked at the start of the year with a group of guys who are not very friend of mine until she started to talk to me a lot and we got along really well and i started to like her. so things were going cool and i felt like she liked me but then we had christmas break for 1 month. in that time we only talked on yahoo about 3 times because we were almost never connected on yahoo. also she always started talking to me immediately on yahoo when she logged in or i logged in. so we actually started school again around 3 weeks ago and she started acting weird with me. she talks to many guys but she usually talked to me more before the break. so 1 week after we got back to school she started talking to another guy but not as much as she did with me before. so then in these 3 weeks she hasnt talked to me that much and i have tried to approach her but i dont know really how to.also now when she logs into yahoo she doesnt talk to me at all anymore.and yesterday and today when i kinda talked to her she acted with me like if she was sad or sick im not very sure, and then moments later she was all hyper talking to the other guy. so then whats happening with her? does she hate me now? does she maybe like me now and its her way of trying to make me realize it? or maybe the other way around and now she likes the other guy? also should i talk to her about it? if you think i should plz tell me PLZ HELP THANKYOU

Last sunday i had texted my friend Kelsie and asked if she wanted to see the new movie ''The Un-invited" tomorrow and she said she would ask her mom later on in the week so she texted me back today and i had asked her what her mom said and she said no so i had asked my other friend Samantha and she had said she would come with me. So i was making plans to go and talking to my mom when i got a text and it was from Kelsie and she said that her mom changed her mind and i didnt want to choose who to bring with me so i asked Samantha if she could come with me,kelsie and my sister and Samantha said no and i asked her why and she didnt answer me back. I already made plans with Kelsie but i dont want to leave Samantha out but it seems like she is making me choose. what should i do?!
20090130193443AABqIVC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife don't have Sex with me and i'm about to cheat?	I love my wife and we have no problems in our relationship other than the lack of sex and affection she gives me. I know she's not cheating because i know where she is at every waking day and put her through many tests that she past with flying colors. I'm starting to feel as if i made a mistake and married a woman 10 years older than myself who already beginning to enter menopause. ( She's not in nowhere near  menopause she's only 30!) I dont care what anyone says, sex is very important to a happy lasting relationship and the people who says otherwise is living in fantasy land. Every time i try to rise up i get shot down like gees flying south for the winter.      I tried talking with her about it i am still lucky to get nooky once every menstrual cycle. I told her that she is forcing my curiosity elsewhere but she still continues the same pattern. When we first met she was on fire but 3years her libido drastically reduced itself to just a wittered spark.      My question is. I met someone else and she is in a relationship herself. Her like myself doesn't not have sex with her husband and is attracted to me like i am to her. We understand that we could never be together and are basically using each other to fill a hole that our mates who (is perfect in all other ways) are home do not care to fulfill.       I need non-biased answers although i know that i will get a lot of emotionally based responses in particularly from women who are associating me with past partners who may have done the same thing to them. Only difference is i love my wife and want to do anything to make us both happy and will never just run out of her life like your X may have done to you.       My Question is:      When you are married should you give over your birth right to your wife to dictate whether you feel good or bad ? If everything else in the relationship is right but one very important thing and you discussed with your wife who doesnt care to change it so you cheat, is it wrong? Should i tie my tubes because she has sexual selfishness or should i see my friend on the outside to make myself happy and make my wife happy by not having to bother her for sex ? Please dont tell me to leave my wife because its not going to happen. The good far outweighs the bad. I feel like a discreet outside courtship will keep both of us content by her not getting annoyed by me not asking her for sex and me not being frustrated by her always saying no or pushing me off of her. As a result, this starts to make me question my own manhood and makes me feel as though i cant be desired by women since your married to one who always rejects you. When i meet with my friend she makes me feel like a whole man again.       What should i do ??????

True love that is...   Also if yall broke up, and he cried everyday and begged for you back until you finally took him back, does that mean he's really in love with you? I don't think a guy would do that if he was using a girl or something. Right?
20090130193653AAz7rI0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	:( Rejected by a girl that I really like?	I really like this girl in my class. When I like a girl, I will be nice to her, sometimes even going out of my way. I'm shy and get nervous around girls that I like. I might stare into space or look at something else every 2-3 seconds to avoid staring. She flirted w/ me 2 days ago and I keep hearing my name come up in her conversations with her friends. When I look @ them, she's laughing with her friends and they stop talking. I sat by her @ lunch (it was kind of awkward so she got someone else to take my seat when I got up to get something 2 eat)      She was really shocked once she found out that I had her phone # (it wasn't easy getting it from my classmates). Her friend told me that she didn't like me back :( and told me that I need to "Chillax"      In class (I usually sit next 2 her) I moved over 1 seat further from her. She asked me why I was sitting there so I went over 2 her and told her that I like her and her friend told me that she didn't like me back and told me to give her some space (I was interrupted while talking 2 her by another classmate so she went 2 1 of her friends, a guy, and giggled while she was talking, constantly looking back @ me).      I wrote a note 2 her explaining what I was trying 2 tell her. She read it, later throwing it away. 1 of my friends took it out of the trash and read it. He was telling me things like "Good job" and "That came from the heart".      Soon, a lot of people in my class were talking about me liking her so it was kind of silent and awkward btwn us until dismissal.      Any advice? (sorry this is so long; I'm shy, but at least I can say my feelings)

Then later that same day, I find out from an alternate source that she has a boyfriend.  This after she ignored 3 phone calls from me (I left no voice messages).        Does she not realize just saying she had a boyfriend would have made me feel a zillion times better and would have cost her nothing?      I know the topic I started says why do "women" but really, why do PEOPLE decline to do things that are free and easy that will make others feel a zillion times better.

Yesterday I was sitting at home talking to one of my cousins and next minute I got a text from my my mate asking me to go meet her, her boyfriend and her boyfriends brother in town. So I ditched my cousin and walked up town. When I got there it was like I may aswell not have even been there. She drove us all to the park and we sat there for 2 hours doing nothing. Her and her boyfriend were getting all uh kinky like right in front of me and his brother and its just so disturbing.   Im sick of her doing this to me! I couldn't text my other mates who usually come and keep me company while shes off with her boyfriend (Guy mates) to come down because they were all on the piss at someones house and they told me to go see them and just ditch my mate but being in a room full of drunk guys didn't really tickle my fancy.   So I just sat there on the grass all by myself.   Im starting to get sick of her. I couldn't just leave because I would have had to walk 6km just to get back to my house.   What the hell am I meant to do?

My husband I are going through visitation issues with his children's mother. We are supposed to be coming up with a parenting plan that we can all agree on. It's really sad because up until now (when she went to the courts for $ because she thought she was going to get more) they have been with us A LOT. I mean we live an hour away from them and they are here at least 145 days a year, my husband would love more. Anyway, she is trying to set their days here at like 110 thinking that she is being so fair and nice to us. Well, he will never agree to that. I mean he wants them 180 days!! I'm just so ill with her and I don't know how to love her as my enemy. She needs to see the love I have from Christ and I just can't shake it. My heart cries to be at peace with her but she is hurting the man I love and her kids by her selfish actions. She just realized through the court system that if we had them the same amount we have been having them that she would also be getting the same amount of money we have been giving her. She went to the courts because she thinks she should get more money, when in reality it's exactly what we should be paying her according to the system and how much time they are here. I just don't know how to get at peace with all of this. I'm very angry. I am afraid that my husband is not angry enough. And I don't mean fighting angry just angry enough to really fight for his kids. Anyway, any scripture or advice?
20090130204441AASdN0l	Family & Relationships;Family	MY LIFE IS TEARING APART!!!?	UGHH!!!    CANT LIFE JUST GIVE ME A BREAK!! IM ONLY 13!      I need help!! my family my life is tearing apart!! I have no other choice but to ask and get help from somone here since i have no one to go too. but anyway... here is my story..      When i turned 8 my parent were getting a divorce i was in a terrible school and we lived in a tiny apartment. At the age i notice the other side of my dad... his agreesive side. But then soon my parent got divorced and ever since then i have been struggling in school. i used to be a STRAIGHT A student but now i make c's and f's. My mom has a boyfriend and has a baby and i feel like she is replacing me because she has told me before she forgets im her child. i live with my dad which was the worst choice ever since my dad is a computer addict and is faking he is some 20 year old dude who has "ab's" and dating other woman online. I know this was wrong but i went on his computer and found out his youtube and saw some things... he locks his door and i sit in my room doing nothing all by myself which he has turned everyone else into a computer ADDICT my brother does the same thing because he looks up to him. He got to me for a little bit making me a complete weirdo computer addict but i stoped myself and thought about what i was doing. I realy wanna tallk to somone about this but i got no one to go too. And i realy wanna tell my dad i know but i dont think i want to because he might get realy mad. My friends make fun of me because i told them about me about being crazy about the internet and having no life. So it looks like i cant go to them, the school counciler is no other choice because my dad is the princable there and she will POSTIVELY will ask him. And whenever im sad and ask dad if i can have a hug he says: Go away im on the computer doing somthing. I now cry every night becuz at night is when i let EVERYTHING out of my system and let it all out with tears. i just hopeless i dont know if im gonna make it in life. And so far im having mood swings and going into depression (I HATE puberty) I love my dad and i know he loves me but i just need  help :-(      -Im sorry if i spelled things wrong i wasnt realy trying to spell everything right i just wanted to get this over with.

WATS UR?!?!?!

20090130200146AAWFRst	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when you feel like you have no one to talk to?	I feel like I have no one. I feel alone and I HATE IT. No one understands me. I feel so depressed because I keep all my thiughts and feelings to myself and honestly, if there was a person that I could trust, I''d tell them. I hate the feeling of boredom, sadness and all the things a person doesnt want to feel. Also, I pretty much hate being with my family. I feel so uncomfortable around them. My parents dont understand, becaus they dont take in the time to LISTEN. They assume negative things of me ( I dont kno what reason I give) and they ignore all the possibilities of why I'm mad all the time. I'm not lying when I say they dont understand. It's true. They dont even TRY. Its like when I say something it goes out the ear and out the other. I hate it. Just having no one tere to listen.   When I'm at school, you'd think I would be an okay person, but I hide it. When I'm at home, I feel like crying all the time. At school, well  I forget it all. Its like Im a whole new person. I dont know who I am. What Im really tryna say is that I NEED someone to talk to. I have "friends" but theyre the type that you can never put ur trust into them. What do you do when you feel like this?
20090130192718AAECcND	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do guys prefer pretty girls?	Is it better for a girl to be pretty than to be a good person or have a nice personality? Is it looks that important? Why?? Can someone tell me?
20090130203419AA8tXTD	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I break the silence with him?	OK, so my best guy friend of a year and half hasn't spoken to me in about two months now. Granted, it's sort of my fault but also his. We went to homecoming together and some drama started there and we weren't as close anymore. He began acting nice and then mean, and then nice and mean. I asked to talk to him to try to work out our friendship at school and he said "OK...we'll talk tomorrow" and then he blatantly ignored me and acted mean for a while until he realized I wasn't going to press the issue, and then started acting nice again, mean then nice on and off. I finally decided I couldn't take it anymore and I decided I wasn't going to make an effort to talk to him anymore - I wasn't going to ignore him if he talked to me, but I wasn't going to try to be around him anymore. Well, basically I guess he thought I was ignoring him and now we both ignore each other even though we see each other everyday. I'm starting to regret it and I wish I could talk to him again but then I think about how mean he has been to me in the past and have to rethink it. I have considered that maybe he's mad at me for something I did, but I'm not sure if it's that or if he simply doesn't care anymore (if your a guy, what do you think?) He's a senior and graduating this year - should I just wait out the rest of the year and forget about him or should I try to rebuild our friendship again? and how - if he's been ignoring me so long, how do I talk to him again without making him mad? Thank you!

20090130195134AAKXUnZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about my bf who is having trouble at home?	ok here's the thing, my bf's been acting really strange lately like he's depressed or something and i think i found out why. I think he's having trouble at home b/c he told me he was going to see the schools social worker today and if i see her it's mostly about my problems with my dad. So I'm glad i accomplished that and figured it wasn't about me er anything. But with me... I am really sensitive to his emotions and when he's depressed it makes me depressed and i can't control it and right now i feel i have no control over how i feel towards anything anymore. I don't even now how i feel about him anymore. How can i make him happier so i can be happier? I know how it feels to have major issues at home and how much it can take a tole on your feelings:( nope not fun!

20090130192838AAjhDpo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Some random guy in my class noticed I was missing?	He asked me where I had been. I don't really know his name- all I know is that he walked with me to the college store through a part of the dorms I don't go through because it was cold outside a few days prior to this. Are people always this nice to people they don't know very well? First answer I got when I posted on another forum was that he liked me, so then I decided to post here, mostly because I'm bored and want to see what other people think. I have no clue what his name is (although he, like most people, probably doesn't know that), and I've never talked to him before this.

20090130195703AAuJqvO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it just me or is this guy a total doosh?	About 5 months ago this guy at work asked me out.  I never really talked to him before but people told me he was a really nice person so I went.  We spent a few hours at the mall and that's it.  The next day I told him I just wanted to be friends but he wanted to tell me that he had feelings for me.  We didn't really talk for about a week after.  Then he asked me out again and I said no.  Apparently he's been telling people that we dated for a while.  He says the weirdest things to me too.  Like "it would be funny if a book case fell on you", he pretends that something he is holding is a gun and he tries to shot me then says just kidding.  He is a nice guy.  Should I say something to him?  He has a girlfriend now.  I think that if I were to tell him I liked him he would dump her in an instant.  The messed up part though is that fact that I'm curious if he actually would.  How sick is that?  I wouldn't do it ever but still, the fact that I thought of it.

It never came natural to me. Its not like I'm a social outcast, but I'm not popular either. I have my friends though. I'm in 11th grade and 16. I've never had a girlfriends in my life. Its kinda sad (i don't need to hear the smart remarks). I just don't see someone like me going up to the girl I like and asking them out though, I'm to shy and I know I would never be able to build up that courage. I don't know how to ask a girl out. And it eats at me, because as much as i want to ask her on a date, i just can't. Its really starting to make me depressed. What can I do to ask a girl on a date or just build self-confidence?

20090130200219AAj67hC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if a friend of your spouse introduces herself as his girlfriend?	My husband has a friend that worked w/him for a few years. She left the company and they remained friends - talking on phone, going to bar. She is an older lady. One day I answered his cell phone and she said is this his wife, I said yes and she said this is Anna his girlfriend paused and said, I mean co-worker. My husband said he does not know why she said this. When I gave him the phone she told him that she thought she was talking to someone else. This has caused a major issue in our marriage. He explained to me that she drinks and gets mixed up on the phone. I did call her and tell her that she should not do this to anyone again because someone else would have tried to hurt her. She said she was sorry, but later told my husband I threaten her. My husband says that I overreacted.  They have known each other for years and I have never met her and if I had, I might have taken this as a mistake.  What do you think

Any ideas... We were thinking of having the reception first (just @ home Mexican food) and then having someone come in and marry us at the time we met... I love the idea and figure if people want to leave before we are officially married thats fine... We have been together 8 years already and have 3 children so we definitely don't want anything traditional...Also I am not a fan of being centre stage and would love just a few people there...Any thoughts , suggestions???

20090130193427AAGsaGy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girls, what do you think aboutt this love story?	This is a true story and was wondering what you girls felt about it.  I won't mention names or anything.        But this young man fell in love with this girl, He loved her so much that he would not even kiss her until their wedding day.  In so many ways he would try to express himself to her, sweep her off her feet he tried so.        Distance often separated them and all he could think about was her.  He eventually asked her to marry him and she said yes!  They spent the next few months together, so many times they were so close and almost kissed, but his love for her was so great he wanted to wait, for her knew a single kiss would make her feel horrible for she always wanted her first kiss to come from her husband on the alter.        After 4 months of engagement she left on a long trip 10,000 miles away for 16 straight months.  He was heartbroken to see the love of his love gone for so long.  Everyday his love for her grew stronger and stronger.        To show his love for her he wrote her a love letter every single day for those 16 months.  He did not send her these letters.  Then on their wedding night, when they went to be a lone together for the first time, he gave her a package and inside were every single love letter he wrote her while they were separated.        Girls, how would you like? Do you like that etc? Input please

20090130202033AAQnjOZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I save my relationship?	I'm 14, and I've been together with my boyfriend, who is also my best friend for 9 months now. But lately it's been getting really dull and we both feel like we're just best friends like we were before, and it doesn't feel like we're dating. He means so much to me.. we talked about it and we don't want to break up, and I wouldn't be able to stand seeing him with someone else. How can I save our relationship before it's too late?

20090130202437AAnFFsb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he just a nice guy or is he flirting with me? ?	I am totally confused. I work with a guy who always makes eye contact with me and gives me a deep stare. The other day he goes "give me a hug" cause I helped him with something. He will also tap my arm or shoulder. Always smiling when he says good morning and bye to me. I'm just not sure what to think, he is a really nice guy and maybe I'm fantasizing. What do you guys think?  For me its becoming a little awkward, when he looks into my eyes I cant hold the stare any longer, makes me so nervous. I know I stare at him throughout the day and he notices it,lol. One of my co-workers thinks he is flirting but its hard to tell. I mean maybe for once a guy likes me for my personality, maybe I'm growing on him.? I'm not bad looking but I know he is better looking out of the both of us. I think about him going to sleep and when I wake up. I know its not love cause I've only known him for a month but my god the feeling...........
20090130195221AAkta5F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cheating on my wife?!?!?!?	I have been cheating on my wife fr the last six months with her ex best friend Kelly. They had a very bad falling out and REALLY don't like each other anymore. I never really talked to her much but then at a friend of mine's 4th of July party, I ran into her and we got talking. I was kind of drunk and she was also. Add in the fact that she has DD's (AT LEAST, forgot to check her bra ;) ) as compared to my wife's B cups and yeah I cheated, so what? We've been doing it ever since and I don't really feel guilty. As soon as my wife and I got back from our honeymoon, she has completely changed, quit working and has become a b!tchy worthless control freak. What's really funny is that when we were dating she was the complete opposite. Knowing that women do this to get the guy to the point that he can't leave her without giving up half of his crap. Anyway, my real question is is there any way that I can leave her without giving her half or all of my crap? Annulment? (sp) Separation? Do the bullsh!t divorce laws apply to these methods of ending a marriage?

Ok, here's a synopsis of my situation:      I knew this one girl liked me at the beginning of the school year.   Everyone started telling everyone else I liked her at the time, however that was not the case then.      Fast forward past Christmas break:   I really like her, she's brilliant, independant, beautiful, however she's just kinda pushing me away.      It's hard to describe.   Her friends and I have always been really close, and they say "She would do anything for you and loves you as a friend."      How do I move beyond that level and get closer to her? She's amazing.

20090130194900AA5JVBP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a relationship where the two people are complete opposites work?	Ever since this guy and I danced together at a school dance i feel a connection with him everytime i am around him.  The first time i ever talked to him was at the dance.  He is a junior, and i am a sophomore.  He is part of the popular group of guys in his class, is pretty boy gorgeous, has lots of money, and is a HUGE party-er (drinks and smokes weed), and does not try very hard in school.  I am completely opposite of this.  I am at the top of my class, try extremely hard, and although occasionally party its not something i have to do.  We talk all the time now and flirt but i don't know if he is just a player, or if anything could ever happen since we are so different.  We have kissed twice and i really like him.
20090130200312AARbYUG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How come all college movies are booze and sex?	Honestly, the most realistic movie about college life from the last 10 years that I can think of is Spider-Man 2. Peter Parker spends his time trying to get good grades instead of getting boozed up and exposing himself to herpes, which is what people who actually succeed in college are like. People who go to college for the parties are the ones who flunk out because they never study and their grades are crap.

Susan can you tell me how to reply properly to you - I'm new at using this!      14 minutes ago   I am a young man of under 20, and think I am falling for a single mum some fifteen years older than me - I teach her son piano on a one-to-one basis - am I silly to be harboring some kind of want for her? Despite my youth, the small amount of time I spend with her son is always enjoyable, I enjoy his take on life. His dad sadly is around anymore and I know she bought him for lessons as she needs a father figure to fill this tragic void in his life - he loves coming for lessons, and I know she appreciates the extra effort I put it for him. I know I may seem very young, but it's as if i adopt a different set of values from most people my age.

And i just agree with him.       Everyone says he likes me, and people say i like him. and we both deny it completely. but i do like him, but i dont know if he likes and i dont think he likes me sorta? idk. but we are always flirting pretty much. we have like play fights. for examply he steals my phone and i am all over him physically to get it back. when we talk he stares into my eyes, or maybe it's just me staring into his.       i have no idea what i should do and i think telling him how i feel will only make our friendship more awkward because he doesnt feel the same way

I am best friends with this girl for almost a year now. we are close off and on. but she knows im into her. but she never shows intrest in me except for smiling and looking into my eyes, and we hug before we say good bye. but even once and a gain she makes me things like with paper and marker. but every now and then i make her something usually like a love letter or something but she refuses to read it in front of me. once i made her a song and she was reading it but she put something in front of her face so i couldnt see her face. we will be walking home sometimes and if i say something nice or flirty she turns her head away from me. not down. but straight the opposite direction of me like she lookin at a house or something. could she be blushing or smiling? why doesnt she want me to see her face when these things happen? short answers are fine but i would like as much info as possible. thank you you guys are awesome.

20090130192856AAFeAbF	Family & Relationships;Friends	What's with my friends? Why don't they invite me places?	Ever since the start of high school I have never really belonged to any one group or clique. (I'm a senior now). I feel that I belong to almost all of the groups in our school because I'm friends with a handful of kids from each one. I also have a lot of friends that aren't even in the same grade as me because I like to treat everyone as if they're in the same class. The reason why I talk to so many people and hang out with them is because I like to have a good time and I like to mix things up every now and then. I'm usually hanging out with different people every weekend, but I have a few close friends who I see most of the time. The problem is, I feel that I'm always the one having to invite people, otherwise I'm forgotten. I always try to include people in my social gatherings, even if I already have plans. The problem is, my friends don't do the same. For example: I'm hanging out with friend A and friend B on a friday night and I don't want to leave friend C at home doing nothing so I invite them along. The next weekend comes  and I decide to invite friend C to hang out again, but I'm told he already has plans. I find out later that he was hanging out with Friends D and E, whom I'm also somewhat friends with. You can tell me to just stop being friends with friend C and to find someone that's kind enough to invite me, but the way 'friend C' acts is pretty much how all of my friends do. Sometimes I feel that I'm really close with these people and other times I feel that I'm invisible to them. I haven't been able to figure out what the problem is.. I'm not annoying, rude, or way to quiet. I'm the type of person who's always trying to laugh and smile and to make others do the same. I have asked several friends why they don't invite me and they usually say "I already had plans." "I forgot." or "Well we really didn't do a whole lot anyways." So does anyone know what the problem might be? I hate trying to discuss this with friends because I feel like I'm trying to make them feel guilty over the situation and then I know that the next time we hang out it's because they felt bad.

20090130193746AAAoJ0u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice please?	Hi well there is this guy i truly loved and was engaged too but we ended it and i still have feelings for this other guy who i had a fling with last year. This guy and i no longer speak because he found out i got engaged and like i mentioned it was a fling. I know when that fling occurred we really liked eachother. Though since the news of my engagement we act like we dont know eachother, well i do because it feels weird because i still have feelings for him. he would try to speak to me but i would avoid him. Now i really want to be with him and want to start over and tell him how i feel. I want to see if a relationship can occur later on but how do i get him to relive his feelings for me i guess or find out if he still has any. Or what do i do about this whole situation??? well thank you in advance

20090130193816AA9NzpF	Family & Relationships;Friends	Im so confused, friend and boy trouble?	ok. i have liked this guy since last year. then i find out he likes my best friend. when i tell her she said that she wouldn't date him, and i said thank you. Then the boy texts her and they start flirting and she tells me everything. and i again ask her if she would date him and she changes her mind to probably. she says that she would never date him if it would hurt me though.    she starts talking about him 24/7 and i tell her flat out that i am SICK of hearing about it. and she says shes sorry. then randomly she says (through text) "don't get mad at my sig. he told me to do it" her sig says *insert boys name here* hot. and i start going crazy. and i finally tell her not to text me until her sig is changed. she doesn't text me back but the boy does. he says hey please dont be mad at her, she didn't do anything wrong. and i text back. yada yada yada. she texts me back and were both crying and crap. and i tell her i really dont want her to date him. and she says she really wants to and that itll "kill her if she doesnt" and we start arguing again. (remember we are best friends. this is killing us both)   finally i give up and i just tell her to date him and kiss him and do whatever she wants. (we made a pact that we would wait til we both had good bfs and at the same time until we kissed them, and ive actually told boys i wouldnt kiss them because she didnt have a decent BF at the time.)    and so now shes all happy. and im sick. im dying. and im so mad. and its killing me. did i make the right choice? do u think me and my friend are gonna still be tight? any advice!

20090130194754AAYu9pF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I break up with this guy who I think is too young for me?	There's this really sweet guy I've met via craigslist and he's so nice but he is entirely too excitable and talks SOoo much and sometimes doesn't let me talk, which really bothers me. I knew once we got to the restaurant, I'd have to think up a way to break the news to him. He called and I didn't answer, but he left a message with his loud friends in the background screaming (another clue he's too young for me)...should I ignore his calls or call him and explain to him.  I know I would rather someone called me and told me instead of blowing me off.

20090130195443AAxP3mQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dude... I don't understand...?	A little while ago i asked a question whether i should go out with this girl, and what signs were that she liked me. She did the shyly looking away thing, flirting thing, helps me when i need it, etc etc, yet i asked her out and she said no.        We weren't like bff's, but we were friends, and now i don't know what will happen. do i continue acting like nothing happened on monday? Also, when i asked her, it was on the phone since i had no time to talk to her at school, (there was a fight, i didnt start it though).        When i talked to her on phone, i wasn't all that confidant, like i am in person. im usually smooth, but now i got like all tongue tied and such. this has NEVER happened to me before i dont know  whether that had to do with it, or she just doesnt like me, or what. And if she tells her friends (which im 96% sure she will) and rumors start going around, what then?      thanks in advance,   Big Z

My cousin and I, we're both very good at singing, but she just got signed a deal with a BIG TIME music director and she is going to sign in the chorus. I'm really happy for her, but I feel a little jealous becuz I'm just as good as her, and she can't speak english that well, but I can. I can sing in a better english accent and stuff, but then again it's an indian song. I sent her an email congradulating her but I didn't feel that great when I sent it to her.

My mom never let me join a chorus class, and once I got a deal to act and sing and stuff, but my parents were just like, it's no big deal, do something more constructive! I've always wanted to sing and act!    I apoligize for sounding a little childish, but it just seems so unfair! I'm sooooo glad my cousin signed the deal, but...you know...   Can someone help me out?

20090130201022AApJwdF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do these actions mean?	Hey! So I like this guy and he was acting like he liked me for a while. Like he would give me hugs and put his arm around my waist every single day. He would always talk to me and try to make me laugh and stuff and I would always catch him looking at me. One time he was even joking around and referred to me as his 'girlfriend and future wife' and call me honey and whatever. One of his friends said we would be cute together and we made like ten seconds of beautiful eye contact lol. One day he said i was pretty and that he would go out with me, and I was really shocked and didn't exactly know what to say so I didn't respond. After that day it got awkward and even though he would still look at me a lot, he wouldn't approach me. He finally said 'honey come here' and wanted me to sit with him at lunch. I might have not given it enough time because we haven't had school any days after that day (snow) but I just wanted some ppls opinions on it so plz answer and thanks so much for reading!

20090130204750AAaleuI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Child Custody Determination?	Me and my ex-girl friend called it quits almost 3-4 months after my daughter was born. She decided she wanted to be with someone else, which I guess stung at the time but I got over it. We've decided we would keep the courts out of it but the more that time progresses it seems like the less she wants me to be in the picture, she makes up lies on why I can't see my little girl, she ignore all my phone calls and when I do get in touch with her she'll say she's with a grandparent or such. So my question is. Does she have the right to keep my daughter from me? Who has custody in a situation as mine?   I'm on the birth certificate, I'm a great father, I have no bad habits and never have I  harmed any of them. The only reason I haven't gone to the court is because I got laid off from my job and I'm collecting unemployment, and I'm scare of the out come. I always see my girl every weekend but it seems like thats to much for my ex and she would rather have a replacement dad as how I feel of it be there more for her then me and it kills me. Any ideas or thoughts on what I should do would be really appreciated.

I was planning to confront him on Monday to tell him I wasn't interested, but I've been thinking about it alot. I don't think I like him in a romantic way, I really do like him, but more as a brother. Im just a sophomore, I dont really have an interest in anyone. Would giving him a chance really hurt our friendship? Should I break all ties? Should I ignore it? I dont know what to do....dont want to hurt him. Dont want to approach my parents about going out either though.

20060624180308AAVhL8p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help!!!?	ok so i have a boyfriend but my parents dont like it. they want me to stop being with him and just be friends, like the other day, they yelled at me for sitting too close to him on my couch!!! we have only been going out for a few weeks and we are taking our relationship VERY slowly. i hug him, but out of the few weeks, ive only held his hand once. im only 14 and half of you people are probably going to say that i am too young to have a boyfriend, but i think that love should not have an age limit. if love had an age limit then life would be pretty hard till your 16 (thats the age when my parents are ok with me dating.), and they have been giving me non stop lectures about it.  i REALLY WANT TO STAY WIHT THE GUY. i mean he is my best friend because we are going out and i love him more than the world itself....what should i do?!?!?!?!? please help me!!!!

She was there to pick me up when things got me down.  I could call her any time.  We did that for each other.    The problem is that a year ago, we decided to go into a buisness together... I would buy material and make the product, and she would sell it along with her fortune telling for people.  She would sell my products and I never got any money back to buy more material... I told her that I wasn't going to do this anymore because it was a rip off and a waste of time.  I was not making any profit.  She said she promised more products to people... I said too bad, I am not throwing money away.     I called later the next week and said that it wasn't worth it to lose our life long friendship over this and we agreed.  She then said that she had some money that was from selling the product.  I haven't talked her or seen her since.

20060606061213AAPcdkq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you feel, and what would you think if your girlfriend told you that she had slept with someone>>>	Around the time you first started dating but you were not offically together. Is that cheating? (It happend one week after we started dating) We first got physical about 5 days later. Before we did she told me that it had been about six months since she had. When I first asked her about the night in question she said that nothing happend with him, about two months after that she told me that they had made out.   And FINALY Seven months after it happend she told me that she did in fact sleep with him.  Why do you think she waited so long to tell me?  Why did she tell me?(she said it was to clear her concience)  Would you have ended it over that no matter how much you loved her?    Would sleep with someone a week after meeting someone else that you were really interested in?
