They both grew up in the same environment except the Beagle is older than the puggle and VERY selfish. The puggle is afraid to play with anything because of fear of being bitten again (It got bitten to the bleeding point in its left ear last time it went for a toy). I've heard of crating, but does it really work?

20080316124404AA5dGWf	Pets;Dogs	Help with Jack Russell Terrier with floppy throat valve?	A friend has a Jack Russell Terrier who went to the vets a month ago as he was making a strange noise when breathing.The vet said the dog had a floppy valve in his throat and that at some point the problem would become so bad the dog would need to be put to sleep.The dog was taken back to the vets again last week as he had grey snot coming out of his nose and his breathing was much worse.The same vet said it was still a problem with the floppy valve and it was all related but prescribed antibiotics which have worked wonders and the dog is no longer having a problem with the snot as it seems to have dried up and therefore his breathing is much better.The vet wants to see the dog this Thursday so he can x-ray and scope the dog under anaestheitc to see if the valve is floppy or whether there is another underlying problem like a tumour. Why did the antibiotics work if it was the valve and not an infection?Anybody got any experience of this problem? What was the outcome?

20080504175556AADa31A	Pets;Dogs	Puppy not Eating?	We have a 19 week old German Shepherd who has been surprisingly growing about 4 lbs a week (up until last week when she slowed to 1, but we had recorded it shorter than a week in time from the earlier recording). But she has never really eaten much food. It is not because she has a lack of appetite because whenever her food is not in her bowl and rather spilled all over the place on the ground she'll gobble it up. (She especially likes to have "real" food added to it, like meat). Currently we feed her Purina Pro Plan as recommended by our veterenarian. It is the strangest thing because she simply will not eat much food in her bowl (only if she hasn't had anything else all day and even then it's not all of it). I don't want to encourage bad habits by always pouring her food on the ground, but I also don't want her to starve or be underweight or have malnutrition or anything like that. Help please!! This has been going on for a while.

20080930212824AAvNZxd	Pets;Dogs	How can a person leave dogs in such horrid conditions?	I'm a groomer at PetSmart, and today - my manager went to a puppy mill and rescued all of te puppies there and got her arrested.      We housed all of the puppies in our grooming kennels and our grooming staff worked as a team bathing them. We used special shampoos for puppies to get rid of their flea and tick infested skin and fur      As we were checking them into Ban Field to okay them all each nurse checked their teeth - they were all rotting and black. Keep in mind these puppies at the oldest were 6 months old - a total of about 17.      Every female was pregnant! When Ban Field IKD them to be groomed, we took them back and started to shave them down. They were matted to the skin. We had to stop because all of the skin underneath was too irritated to go on, and some parts were even open wound!      I was holding a scruffy Schnauzer and I noticed it's tail was docked unevenly, and the edges of the ears were infected. We were later told that the mill owver confessed that she docked and cropped the ears herself.      Honestly, who could do this to a dog? How can we help prevent this?

They are all healthy and beautiful, thankfully. But I noticed that Lucy still has a few lumps in her belly, like more kittens to come out. She delivered her last kitten at 5 am, is it possible there are still more left to come out? Why is it taking so long, and should I be concerned? She seems okay, and healthy too. How long should I wait to call a vet? I'm not even sure if she has more kittens inside of her, is there any way I can tell for sure?

20081007040837AApoVAb	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat meow when I go to the bathroom?	Whenever I get into the bathroom, she follows me, stands by the door and starts meowing. Is it because she thinks I'm leaving (the bathroom is by the door)? Or is it because her sandbox is in there, perhaps?
20081008084842AAy8opG	Pets;Cats	Is this normal vetinerary treatment?	Sunday morning my cat was limping badly after a cat-fight - putting no weight on one hind leg. Monday afternoon, the vet did an x-ray which showed no fracture. When we went to collect puss we discovered the vet had put elastic strapping on the leg which she intends removing tomorrow or Friday. Said we had to keep puss in which has proved impossible although we've kept an eye on her when she's out (and put a plastic bag over the strapping to keep it dry). Her leg seems fine now as far as we can tell and she's in great form apart from hating her leg being confined.      Tomorrow we have to go back to get the strapping removed under sedation. I know from experience that the bill for all this will be whopping. I could understand it if there was a serious injury, but for a sprain?      Do you think our vet is overtreating this or is it normal practice?

I know it is impossible to predict their every thought, but to know how they would react in most situation?

20081027171428AAAfcz0	Pets;Dogs	Is my dog part Dalmation?	I bought my dog as a 6 week old puppy about seven months ago now. He is a Cavalier King Charles cross Pomeranian (or so I was told). He doesn't look ANYTHING like a Pom but exactly like a King Charles. He has really long hair but we got him shaved for summer about 2 days ago and we noticed that he has black spots on his white patches and I think he may be part Dalmation because I know that Dalmatians are born white and develop their spots later, which is just what my dog is doing! Is my dog part Dalmation?      here's some pictures hope they help!   the 1st one is what he looked like b4 we shaved him.       http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq64/...        http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq64/...        http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq64/...        http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq64/...

20081110072923AAczvhJ	Pets;Dogs	Can anyone recommend a medium/large breed?	This prereqs might seem extensive, but I'm going to spend the next decade or so with a dog so I think it's reasonable.    I would like a breed that is moderately large (nothing over 100lbs or under 30) is relatively quiet (suburb dweller) and somewhat protective. I love Goldens but I'd rather have a dog that doesn't fawn over every single person it meets; and since I'll be walking the dog alone most of the time I'd prefer a dog that has some protective instincts. Unfortunately I'm not allowed to own Pits, Chows, GSDs, Rotties, Akitas, or bulldogs (I really don't get that one, but what can you do?)   Last but definetly not least, my dog really needs to not be the type that wants to play all day long. I have access to parks, a large (abeit unfenced yard) a tennis court and jogging tracks, but when I want to chill I'd like for my dog to chill too.   Thanks for your suggestions!   And don't worry, I haven't forgotten the love-able mutts, it's just hard to predict what a shelter dog's tendencies will be.

20090202075127AAQMyzs	Pets;Dogs	Getting my puppy`s attention in all situations?	I have a 3 month old puppy.  Last week, I looked up several instructional videos online, and was able to teach him to sit, come, and lie down.  He will do these behaviors on cue 90% of the time.  However, if he is distracted, such as when he is in a new environment or when company comes over, he will not obey the cues.  I am mostly concerned about the come command, as I will often need to use it for his own safety. How can I make him learn to come EVERY time, and keep focused on that?  One idea I had is to use an extra tasty treat, like cheese, and do several repetitions of it every day (I used kibble to train him).  Does anyone have any advice to spare on this issue? Cheers!

20090202091300AAMnRfL	Pets;Dogs	Aggravated with my brother's dog...?	My brother's dog, Max, was brought over here about a month ago and dropped off. He was fine the first few days. Then he started attacking my dog. This happens every time I go outside. My dog, Scrappy, will come up to me and Max will attack him. Scrappy never attacks, not even in self defense. Scrappy just bares his teeth and barks/growls. I have told my brother and his girlfriend many times that I am tired of Max doing this and something needs to be done. They will not listen. So, what should I do about this. I am afraid that Max will do it when one of my brother's gf's kids go outside and get hurt that  Scrappy will be blamed as well. What should I tell them?   And also, Max is a very territorial dog. He will alert if there is someone here. My mom's friend said that one day he thought Max was going to bite him. I am afraid that if he bites someone, they will try to take Scrappy too. Is there anyway to prevent that if Max does bite?   See, my brother is one of those people that gets a dog b/c it is cute then when it isn't a cute puppy anymore, chains it up. Max has spent most of his life on a chain.   **Both of these dogs are intact. Scrappy has an appointment to get neutered. My brother will not get Max neutered.**      If you guys have any questions...ask....and I'll add any other info you need.

20090202204812AAOKlSM	Pets;Dogs	High PH Level in Dogs Urine?	So last week I took my eighth month old puppy to the vet because I suspected he had a bladder infection.  Turns out he had crystals instead of bacteria and a high PH level. The vet was busy when I called back and I forgot to call later, although I set an appointment for x-rays for bladder stones. But this PH level I’m curious about, my vet left a message recommending a special dog food to lower it, but my puppy is VERY picky, it took six dog foods and days of him starving himself until we tried Blue Buffalo and he actually eats it so I’m wary to try and change food and force him to eat this, knowing most likely he’ll hate it. Is a high PH level dangerous to him, or something he can live with? He’s on an anti-biotic right now, something like amoxicillin. If this PH level is harmful or uncomfortable, I guess I’ll have to try to get him to eat this food, but if it’s something he can live with I’ll be relieved.

He has a clean litter box and a lot of food and water. He also is very rude when he begs for food. which he does constantly. I'm not exactly sure how to discipline a cat. I don't hit him, hardly, but I yell at him when he does something wrong, like jumping up/walking around on top of the kitchen counter and he is very quick to jump off when he realizes he has been caught, but I want him to realize its wrong and not do it ever. He is very sweet most of the time but has no manners at all!

The day before yesterday I gave them Ick treatment, I took the filter out as it said to and after the Ick treatment was done I put in Fungus treatment cause it said to do a treatment of that after the Ick treatment to help it from coming back.    Well it seems I lost one of my little goldfish yesterday morning and now another one will go to the bottom of the tank and just sit and not move at all, flip his fins nothing he just sits there untill I tap on the glass and swims away again.   I went and got some Aquarium salt to put in the tank. It says 1 tablespoon for every 5 gallons and its a 30 gallon tank. So I put in  So i put in 3 table spoons today and I will leave it for a day and let it get through the water and then add the last 3 tablespoons tomarrow so I dont add too much at once and shock their system.      Now My question is my water is cloudy and green, like a kind of mucky green that just recently started. I think its from the salt but wondering if perhaps its something eles. And any suggestion on what eles I could do for my bottom sitting fish and what it might have since none of my other fish are doing this but that one?   I want to try and do as much as I can to keep any more fish from dieing out on me.      Its a 30 Gallon tank with 8...well 7 fish now since one died.    some regular and some fancy tail goldfish   Temp right now is about 78-79      Any suggestions would be good..thanks!
20090203020420AALJ2yN	Pets;Dogs	My dog still isn't crate trained!HELP!!?	My Bichon Frise is now 8months old and we have tried all forms of toilet training. Are last resort was the crate. He loves the crate and for the 1st couple of weeks it worked fantastic. He would be clean all night and ask to go out when he needed the toilet and we then praised him straight away with treats. However he has now gone backwards and for the past week has been having accidents again!We clean the bedding each time and don't make a fuss. I thought dogs like keeping their area clean?What can i do? I tried all other forms of training from the day we got him at 8weeks and nothing works. I know he can hold it because when I am home all weekend he is fine. Any advice?

20061011073001AAk6TFi	Pets;Dogs	?me ayudan a tomar una difícil decisión?	hace dos meses recogi un perro en la calle, todo sarnoso, flaco y enfermo, lo ba?e, lo cuide lo alimente, y tambien me di cuenta de que es sordo,      En este momento tengo a mi madre delicada de salud, tengo tres perros y dos gatos dentro de mi casa (o sea no puedo meter uno mas) mi cochera no esta cerrada y  ahi lo tengo, desgraciadamente en este momento todo el dinero se invierte en mi madre asi que no puedo darme el lujo de cerrar la cochera, el perro he tratado de darlo en adopcion pero nadie lo quiere porque esta sordo, excelente guardian y ese es el problema, defiende la puerta de la casa con su vida y nadie puede pasar, se esta volviendo muy agresivo con la gente que no conoce y como no oye pues no se le puede frenar.      Hoy tengo que tomar una decision en el refugio en que contribuyo hay dias que no comen pues no alcanza el dinero y la otra es el sacrificio de este animal, ayudenme a tomar una decision porfavor.

20090202095044AAfJEvd	Pets;Dogs	What kind of lifespan are we looking at here?	Sorry this is long I had a lot to say...please I need some peace of mind         Okay as many of you know our 1 year old poodle has been struggling from pancreatitis from the time he was real little.    6 or 7 months of age it started.      Well he was officially diagnosed in September 2007.    We still don't know what caused it (I mean we never fed him people food at all....vet theories are a combination between his bad genes and the crap food we were feeding)      His old vet didn't even look for what was wrong it was his new vet that discovered the problem      Well we put him on California Naturals and he got his weight back up and he was doing good for awhile he eats the lowfat      But he had another attack of it a week ago and his weight dropped but we got him to the vet and on medicine       (the vet said this time since it came back he will deal with this the rest of his life)      She doesn't want to put him on meds becuase he is so young and we are going to manage it with diet.   She said keep him on the low fat food.      But my question is she said something about him not having as long of a life as most poodles.....      She wouldn't go into that though.      So what kind of lifespan are we looking at?   5 years, 10 years, 12 years?    I mean I know its impossible to know.      She said as long as we stay on top of this he can have a good full life and live a long time.....      But not as long as other poodles.   (Poodles typically live to be between 14 and 16 years old)      She said just love him and enjoy him (and we will and we do)        I'm just wondering.      He means so much to so many people.   But I just can't lose him he is too important to me.     I can't go through this again so soon.      So what do you think the outlook is....      I mean the vets outlook was positive but at the same time I am scared.
20090202093751AADzva0	Pets;Fish	If you're dividing up a betta tank?	Say you wanted to divide a tank into 4-5 compartments. Would you just have one small compartment for the filter and heater, and then have the bettas in the other compartiments? Or would you just go with an undergravel filter for the whole thing, and then have the heater kind of in a middle betta's compartment?      How do you make sure one betta doesn't get cooked and the others are freezing? Even if you have water flowing through perforations in the dividers, you can't prevent one compartment from being much hotter than the furthest because there won't be perfect flow and heat dissipation.      The dividers would be opaque so they couldn't see each other. Each compartment would be 2.5 gal or larger.
20090202092909AAz8sVG	Pets;Dogs	Guess what i just saw in my front yard?	A dog who must have been a stray and his bones were sticking out and he was obviously close to dying I tried to put food out for him but he so far gone he needs to be taking out of his misery.                To all you people who have pets and can't or don't take care of them take them to an animal shelter or pound don't drop them off on my back roads and expect them to stay healthy. This is not right. I am so tired of hearing and seeing animals dropped off in the middle of nowhere. How do you live with yourself when it's free to drop them off at a pound? Im so disgusted with humans lately it isn't even funny. These animals shouldn't suffer because of some poor choice you made.
