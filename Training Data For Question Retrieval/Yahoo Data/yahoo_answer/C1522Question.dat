20060617020604AANDHHV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How does someone go about encourage themself and building their self-esteem?	I'm a christian.  I've been told over the period of 38 years how lazy, worthless, no good I've been.  I've been having trouble getting through some things in my past that have been done or said to me.  I tend to focus more on the negative things that are being said instead of the positive.  I've been saved for ten years, and have from time to time experienced some of this negativity from fellow christians.  There is one lady in particular that I would have to explain our relationship as a parent-child (me being the child).  I know I should confront her on this, but I don't know how to go about it.  Please, if anyone can help, I'd appreciate it and could even use prayer.  I've just spent the last hour literally crying out to God for help.

I am not sure but it seems that Jesus was baptized in the name of Father so how come than some ppl reverting to Jesus?
20060805204848AAQbef2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this one of the best definitions of Science you've ever read?	This quote is attributed to James Randi. A stage magician turned debunker;   Science is best defined as a careful, disciplined, logical search for knowledge about any and all aspects of the universe, obtained by examination of the best available evidence and always subject to correction and improvement upon discovery of better evidence. What's left is magic. And it doesn't work.   -- James Randi       And how very, VERY right he is too.   Science is self correcting. People make mistakes but science, does not. Magic and superstition and mythology on the other hand, never makes mistakes.   "god did it and it is good" just doesn't work for real scientists. Ever.   The faster you creationist sheep understand that, the better.

Whenever he saw my little daughter he smiled ear to ear, but when I got close to him his facial expression became one of fear.

20060811120320AAteB75	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Long repost:Why do many Christians work so hard to make the Bible say that Jesus will Condemn non-Christians?	Isn't this judging?      I don't think that He did. Nor, do I think that any was condemned in the Bible.       The Way to me appears to be through the Judgement of Jesus Christ, which we will ALL get regardless of religion.       If we have accepted God then we have quite possibly accepted Jesus, right?       Why work so hard to theoretically condemn Muslims (for instance) rather than arguing the possiblilty of salvation. Rather than considering the possibility that they have a hold of some of the Truth.      I counter that we must discuss Jesus with other religions that they may understand God, not that it is a necessity that they convert (though this appears to be purposely unclear).      You intend then that we can discuss God with people while simultaneously condemning all of their ancestors. I would say this is a strong arm tactic.       Rather say, the safests way is...      I find it despicable if this is not your hope.

20060728131212AAbk2kl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For christians- Do you believe the God described in the Old testament Is the Same God jesus talked about?	Is the Vengeful, Angry and Vendicitive God of the Old testament a direct contradiction to the way Jesus was,  IF you have not read the old testament, specially Leviticus and Deteronomy plz dont answer.  When God ordered the israelites to stone their wifes and daughters if they begun to worship other gods, or stone homosexuals, doesnt this ring a bell in your head that there is something wrong with the bible as a whole.  I am a christian and i believe that jesus is the way to God. I know jesus was jewish, but i also know that the things thas jesus taught us are no way near the same as what was told to the israelites 3000 years ago.  The times dont justify the actions.  Excuses such as; it had to be so that the messiah may come, or that people back then were evil, or that God was trying to preserve a holy society do not measure up to any logical or moral reasoning. Ordering anyone to Murder someone else will do nothing else but create Anger, Hatred, and Intolerance.

20060726023943AAsj8DA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Well finally muslims have accepted Jesus as the son of God and left Islam read it and give me an opinion?	Hitler said if a lie is repeated often enough and long enough, it would come to be perceived as truth. One such lie often repeated is “Islam is the fastest growing religion”.  Every day thousands of Muslim intellectuals are leaving Islam. They find Islam inconsistent with science, logics, human rights and ethics. Millions of Iranians already have left Islam However the exodus from Islam is not reserved to the intellectuals but also the average Muslims are finding that Islam is not the way to God but to ignorance, poverty and wars. They are leaving Islam to embrace other religions especially the Christianity.Perhaps it is best to listen to the truth coming from the mouth of the horse. The Internet site aljazeera.net published an interview with Ahmad Al Qataani ???? ???????? An important Islamic cleric who said: “In every hour, 667 Muslims convert to Christianity. Everyday, 16,000 Muslims convert to Christianity.

20060904072654AAIvgOn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is ignorance and rejection of the science behind the Theory of Evolution really a bad thing?	Disclaimer: I'm an agnostic who believes in Evolution.      Really, friends, is it really such a bad thing if people who are religious don't believe in the Theory of Evolution?        Since it is the truth, of how the human species came about, from an earlier non human species, it doesn't need to be pushed, anyone who has any intellectual curiousity will stumble on it and believe it to be an explanation for the Origin of the Species.      There is a reason Christians knock on doors handing out their literature, trying to recruit a membership.  Evolution does not require a membership.      The sad reality is that "this is a Christian nation"; and having been a Christian nation since 1776 they have not eliminated poverty, but neither has science.  Praying to Jesus hasn't cured any diseases, science has done that, so what if some Christian wants to credit Jesus for giving the scientist the know how.      I'd ask simply what of prayeres to other gods for cures?   And that will go unanswered honestly.

And that teenages use the primitive imigdula as opposed to the frontal lobes for reason and emotional thinking and the aformentioned.      I read a lot of things on here that just make me feel sorry for how ignorant and utterly uneducated people really are.      This is why I can't stress enough the importance of a college education.      A lot of people opinions aren't their own but rather just regurgitation what the've been told.

20090227143428AAVD8o4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So, according to this "person" I knew, he said "no kind deed would go unrewarded".  The Bible says that our?	good deeds are like vomit in God's mouth.  We can never do enough good things to impress him.    However, in his analogy, answering questions on Y/A is a "good deed".  While, in the past 2 weeks I have helped a man who went into a diabetic coma, who was from out of town, make it to the hospital (his wife actually, he went in the ambulance), and then drive their friend to the hotel she was staying in to get her vehicle.  And today, there was a man standing outside of Wal Mart, and while we live pay check to pay check I understand when he held up the "Hungry sign".  So, I pulled through Burger King and got him a large Chicken sandwich meal and a $10 gift certificate and gave it him.     To me this is not something to pat yourself on the back for but this guy who was a SGT in the Air Force for 4 years and 30 years later that is his biggest accomplishment thinks the world is a better place b/c he answers questions.       Religious opinion?        And also Moral Opinion?      Just wondering what you think on both.......................................         No, I am NOT trying to say I am a good person, if I feel lead to do something for someone I do, not b/c I expect anything for it.  Most of the times, I do much more than anticipated or expected and most of the time people are ugly and rude and obnoxious to me....that kinda blows the you will get rewarded theory away for me.  But it does not matter, I will continue to do as I am lead.

Usually, this takes place whilst he's downloading pirated software and not doing any work in class. He also doesn't believe in the 10 commandments and, when I ask him if he has ever had a girlfriend, he says that he can't have a girlfriend since, he's a protestant. Does anyone know what planet he and his family are on?

We see in John 1 that Jesus was the Word of God, which was God.  He is God.  Not only that, but it is clear that He was alway in perfect unity with God, and indivisible from God even in death.      How then, can a Judge, known to be perfectly Just, acquit a man from a death sentence, if no price is paid.      If God is not love, then what does the Qu'ran represent.      And if they assault me is it because I have wounded them with the truth, or are they proud, for I speak thusly to Imams, that they may not judge me, but rather discuss more important truths.

And this question doesn't just apply to pagans who have had bad experiences with Christians, but Christians who have honestly had bad experiences with pagans, or any other combination with tons of religions.      Personally I am a Christopagan, and I've had bad experiences with evangelical Christians (they are like the only group of Christians I can say I hate or can't stand), I've recently had a really bad experience with Chaos Mages and Discordians. Even online, they gave me really bad vibes. One in particular because he's out to hurt someone dear to me and possibly me. (The details are a bit surreal, so I won't get into them) But I prayed about it and I don't think he'll strike, but still such a bad tastes in my mouth.      P.S. Please no one come in here telling me to be aware of the dark magicians, I've had enough experience.

20090227142934AAGiQ73	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Wartime Pope's Secret Heroism?	- thought both Catholics and Jews in particular might like this post:      Documents have come to light showing that Pope Pius XII saved tens of thousands of European Jews from the Nazis.      He ordered convents, monasteries and Catholic Churches to hide Jews from the Gestapo. He also asked the Brazilian government to accept 3000 'non aryans' and persuaded the Dominican Republic to grant visas for a further 11,000 people.      These documents have been discovered in Vatican archives by Dr Michael Hesemann, a German historian. Material from them has been posted online by the PAVE THE WAY Foundation, a largely Jewish group asked by Yad Vashem to investigate the role of the wartime Pope.      Full story in the Jewish Chronicle;  http://www.thejc.com       Jewish and Catholic friends - an interesting and reassuring revelation, wouldn't you agree? :)

When I was working and going to school, I was so busy that our arguments were spaced apart.  I have always believed my husband's excuses were true...I wasn't enuff, too much stress, or I was a nag by bringing up things that upset him.   I recently lost my job to illness.  For two years I have prayed for God to help turn our hearts.  I read my bible daily, believe in prayer and trying to respect this marriage.  I've seen short-term changes in "Ned".  ButYesterday, he decided I was sleeping wrong and should move.  I said no it takes too long for me to get my back  comfortable (I was not in his way).  He complained; turned on lights and carried on while I prayed and didn't move.  Eventually he elbowed me in the head and grabbed at my face--i had a slight bloody nose and now its black/red.  As I prayed for protection the blows didn't hurt---and I prayed for help.

20090227143603AAcM0UD	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How harmless is this "office flirting"?	I've been in a relationship for over a year, my boyfriend and I currently live 4 hours apart, due to work.      I recently started a new job and there's a guy there who I get on really well with. He's kind of 'typically good looking' and I admit I find him attractive. We have a laugh and admittedly it is occasionally a bit 'flirty' (or would seem that way), but more him than me, and he knows I have a boyfriend.(Not in a pushy way)      I have no intentions on acting on my attraction...but I feel guilty. But then part of me thinks I'm only human, and so long as I don't act on it it's ok?      I love my boyfriend very much and don't want anything to jeoparadise us.      Any advice?

And everything was ok, but when we were done I accidently dropped one of the dresses, because I was carrying so much stuff.  My friend opened the door, and a different sales woman was standing right there.  She said, "First of all, you two shouldn't be in the same changing room.  Next time you do that, I won't let you try anything on.  And pick up that dress on the floor.  It's over $100 dollars!"  She gave us a dirty look and she talked in a very snobby way.  She could have just been like "Excuse me, but you two shouldn't really be in the same changing room.  Could you please pick up that dress of the floor?"  Does anyone agree with me!?!

Some overweight women wear clothes that just isn't made for their body form, and then if people stare or make fun of them them get all angry and mad. I just think that if they think they look good, then that's nice for them but they shouldn't get mad when people stare knowing that they're overweight. I think it's also rude when some say that thin people(not stick thin) aren't smart. I have come across people like this. So just why do they act like this?       I am not being mean, I'm being serious. I could care less whether or not people are big or thin.

20061112080358AAA0sTc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question for  Young Earth Creationists?	By which I mean I mean people who hold to a view that the world was created in six 24 hour days as opposed to "Intelligent Design adherents.      What do you think of the words of Saint Augustine of Hippo:      "No Christian will dare say that the narrative must not be taken in a figurative sense.........In matters that are obscure and beyond our vision, even in such as we may find treated in Holy Scripture, different interpretations are sometimes possible without prejudice to the faith we have received."      Now this is one of the Great Fathers of the Church - we are talking SERIOUS sainthood here.  He is denying the literal interpretation of Genesis which it appears to me is the foundation of young earth creationism.  Do you have other reasons for prefering the young earth theory to old earth theories or do you think you know more than the saint?

Well anyway, I'm not interested in flirting or anything, just making some more like minded friends and to find somewhere to chill when i turn 18 and hang with mates. I'm not searching for that special someone though as I already have her and she's my wonderful Evira who I'm engaged to.    Anyway, the reason i've asked this question is cos I'm a pre-op male-to-female transsexual, so I'm still a guy currently and by 18 unless some miracle happens I'll still be a a guy, i intend to get a sex change and have already started treatment and have a confirmed diagnosis of GID but i still have ages to go before I reach the stage of RLE, hormones and SRS and all that lot.    Will I be able to get into a lesbian bar when I turn 18 as I technically will be a lesbian, just not in the right body and I've already said I'm not interested in flirting or anything, I just wanna make friends and hang out.    Will I be able to get in a lesbian bar at 18?    Btw, i live in the UK not the US, here it's 18 not 21 for age to drink alcohol...

20061120114404AA7yVbZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fundamentalist/Evangelical Christians: Why do you oppose personal responsibility?	Actually, I want to know why you continue to agree with the Government on the Drug War. The bible makes no explicit reference to abstinence from drugs (of course, I don't know it by rote, so I might be wrong.), and even though the bible says to obey the laws of the land, why do so many of your stripes insist on governmental enforcement of your PERSONAL beliefs. (Again, I do not know for sure if drug use is censured in the Bible, but I don't think it is.) Yet, many of you are supposedly conservative, which would imply that you believe in personal responsibility and lack of government intrusion into private lives.       If the government said that, say, Baptism is bad for no good reason (like it did with drugs) and the people must be "protected from themselves" or "give them back their self-respect" (I have great self respect, and I love to take opioid painkillers, which obviously do not make me stupid in any way.) there would be another revolution, or at least a guerilla war.      Why?

A lo largo de mi vida por distintas razones....?	he vivido en diferentes lugares, edo de mex, usa, rumania, etc... digamos que más o menos sé adaptarme a un lugar nuevo y a sus costumbres.  Nunca he tenido problemas por se "chilanga".  Resulta que ahora vivimos en Mérida Yucatán y no es personal, pero la verdad me ha costado mucho trabajo, no me he sentido bienvenida y he recibido muchas groserías por parte de la gente.  Cuando llegas como turista eran un amor, pero cuando saben que vas a vivir acá y que no eres de aqui sacan un odio no sé de donde y quizas son solo detalles, pero hacen reuniones y no te invitan, hacen chistes de chilangos, y bajita la mano, ya me quiero ir... de hecho, dicen que soy "extranjera".  Yo les dije que soy mexicana y que yo sepa, yucatan es parte de México, por lo que no me siento ni soy extranjera, creo que puedo ir desde baja california hasta quintana roo y no seria extranjera, pero bueno, mi esposo y yo nos queremos ir y nos late puebla, diganme honestamente, creen que la cosa seria parecida, me animo?
20070302070530AACMIiZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?Podrías atestiguar bajo juramento que el mero Dios le dictó leyes a Moisés?	El pecado es una transgresión de la ley de Dios, pero dicha ley solo es la que aparece en la biblia y para creer que existe el pecado tendrías que estar seguro de los relatos del Pentateuco donde Jehová dicta una extensa ley y sus repectivos e inmisericordes castigos a Moisés  como en aquel momento solo estuvieron Jehová y Moisés y nadie más lo vió, nadie podría corroborarlo ni estar seguro de ello, por lo tanto EL PECADO ES UNA PALABRA RELIGIOSA INVENTAD POR EL HOMBRE, al igual que el libre albedrío es el invento para justificar la ausencia y el quemimportismo de dicho Dios.

20070426072443AA9yKbk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?Adán y Eva no pecaron sino que le prestaron un servicio a Dios?	CItas:   "Existen situaciones, como sea, en las cuales es posible transgredir una ley sin cometer un pecado, como en el caso de Adán y Eva en el Jardín de Edén (2 Ne. 2:22-23).. Es apropiado, y acorde con el patrón escritural, hablar acerca de la transgresión de Adán, pero no del pecado de Adán" - Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrina  Mormona, p. 804      "La elección que hicieron, eleva a Adán y Eva a tener preeminencia entre todos los que han venido a la tierra... La "Caída" y el consecuente acto de redención de Jesús vinieron a ser los eventos más gloriosos en la historia de la humanidad"- Apóstol John A. Widtsoe, Evidencias y Reconciliaciones, 1960, p. 194.      "En la filosofía de José Smith sobre la existencia, Adán y Eva fueron elevados a un lugar principal entre los hijos de los hombres, únicamente por debajo del Salvador. Su acto debía ser aclamado...La llamada "Caída" se convirtió en un acto necesario y honorable para el plan de Dios" - John Widtsoe      Citas de literatura mormona o SUD

I believe this because only God knows my fate. I read earlier that soemone said life dictates circumstances which we have to accept. I totaly dissagree. I will only accept a situation if I want to, not because life says I have to. I beleive it is how people who are born poor die multi-rich. There is only 1% of the whole populaton in America who are millionaers. What is wrong with this figure. With all the college graduates in the U.S. and all the ways to make money, why does that statistic exist. Am I the only person that it bothers or can someone show me some love.

I nearly lost my job over it. But I was right! That person did not deserve the treatment they where getting!

20081002123632AAIXED7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So what do Christian teach when they minister to the lost?	see I will not teach people that it's ok to sin because Jesus died for your sins cause a person won't strive or try to walk right?   I won't tell a person that he will sin every day cause we don't know what God will is for a person and we don't know what God perfect plan is for them?   I will not teach a person that it's ok to sin in any fashion cause that is not what Christ taught? Christ taught us that we should be perfect as our father in heaven is perfect.   Christ taught us to love all.   Christ taught us not to deceive anyone.   By telling someone they can't be perfect leaves a person wonder, then why make a effort to do something that is impossible.    you teach a person that we are guarantee to sin.   You teach a person that if they sin all their sins will be forgiven.   You teach a person your way and not Christ ways.   the reason I know this, cause the trash you try getting me to see is not the way that Christ taught.    When Christ said, go and sin no more, it was a command.   Christians don't give commands, they give choices with a excuse plan. If someone sin, oh just use the don't judge me card to get people to stay off of your back. or just tell them you are not perfect, or if God told you to do something, just tell them all they have to do is try.   like I said before, you can always tell the worldly christians from the true christians. true christians talk and walk. worldly christians just have the talk and a lot of excuses that follow their talk.  these are the same Christians who will use the phrase well you are not God when you confront them about doing something they shouldnt be doing.   If you really think the whole bible is inspired by God, then do what the bible say, woman remain silent and learn from your husband since this was written after the resurrection of Christ. and if you can't bear children, then you are screwed since that is how woman are saved.    You folks claim l need to read the bible again, when are you going to start living it instead of trying to tell me to reread it.

20070727190012AAyZBl6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Nem só da palavra vive o homem....!!!?	O papa Bento 16 pode até parecer menos carismático do que Jo?o Paulo 2o, mas para os tesoureiros do Vaticano ele tem toque de Midas com os fiéis.      Conforme reportagem de capa da revista italiana Espresso, publicada nesta sexta-feira, o pontífice alem?o n?o está lotando apenas a Pra?a de S?o Pedro nas tradicionais audiências das quartas-feiras e nas bên??os do Angelus aos domingos, mas também o caixa do Vaticano.      Apesar dos escandalos dos padres pedófilos nos Estados Unidos, as doa??es aumentaram durante o seu pontificado.      Com o título "Que Tesouro de Papa", a revista assinala que as doa??es dos fiéis cresceram 58% em 2006 em rela??o ao ano anterior, chegando a US$ 101,9 milh?es (cerca de R$ 193,6 milh?es).      “N?o tem escandalo pedófilo. Nenhuma ingerência política que se pague. Nenhuma gafe no relacionamento com outras religi?es que se desconte. A realidade é que Bento 16 administra uma igreja que financeiramente explode de saúde”, diz o texto.   fonte:BBC

Me refiero a nuevas Corrientes cristianas modernas, en las q se promueve el ‘dejar todo en mano de Dios’, q tal cosa es mala y causada por satanas.

Tienen problemas d dinero y en lugar d buscar un mejor trabajo o estudiar una carrera, lo q hacen es “dejarlo en manos d Dios”. Escuchan x ejemplo d percances típicos del fin d semana y dicen “q el diablo anduvo suelto’, se pelean entre hermanos en casa, y dicen q fue el demonio en lugar de hablar c/los hijos y platicar q les molesta, o d la gente q sufre se queja d todo pero no hace nada x si misma ya q ora y lee la Biblia porq se hace la voluntad de Dios, y como dejan TODOS sus problemas En manos de Dios se convierten en unos inútiles al dejarle todo el trabajo a nuestro Se?or, q ya bastante tiene.

Sin embargo, dado que usa argolla de matrimonio, pues yo me había frenado un poco, pero la semana pasada acepté que me invitara a comer.      Fuimos y allí me contó que está en proceso de divorcio. No quise indagar más. La verdad es que suelo ser muy penosa y no soy muy platicadora que digamos (por este medio es más fácil hablar y pedir consejos).      El asunto es que el quiere que nos tratemos. Me habló muy lindo y lo único que me dijo es que a él le encantaría que yo conozca más sus creencias.      Yo le dije que por mi parte no llevaba prisa y prefería que el terminara bien su relación para poder empezar algo. Como que eso no le gusto pero accedió.      No somos novios, pero obviamente, el ya empezó el proceso de los detalles y los mensajes y correos lindos... pero le da mucha importancia a que conozca sus creencias, ?uds. qué opinan?

Hi guys, my name's Ted and I'm a counselor at a Christian youth group. We believe in teaching the love and guidance of Christ, but we also like to have a little fun. :) I play acoustic guitar and have a bit of a reputation as the "fun" counselor among some of the kids, and would love to share a little song I wrote that I plan on debuting this week. It's all about the love we feel through God and how, with a little help from our heavenly father, anything is possible!

I'm confused about a dream I had!!!   I watched the episode where he (Jack) writes the play about Jack getting run over by a bus and now he's dead, to teach Will and Grace a lesson and make them feel bad about ignoring him.    Then I dreamed that Jack was my own brother and he died (well, he committed suicide by drinking poison) because I told him I hated him and that I didn't love him and that I hoped he would get crushed by a bus. So he drank some poison and died with a note that said I would be sorry :(   Then I went to Jacks funeral and I was laughing cause I didn't care that he was dead, even though in the dream he was my brother!    Im only 18 but my real little brother darren is 16, and hes gay!   Am I just cold hearted. I never thought that I was!!!   If Jack was your brother and he DIED cuz you told him to jump in front of a bus, would u cry or not care? Jest had to write this cuz it was so weird a dream!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

20070805072727AAu5EfV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My thought for the day...?	So I'm not sure if I'm wrong about any of this, but here's what I'm thinking today.  People say that God will forgive a murderer a child molester, a theif, a straight man that cheats on his wife throughout their whole marriage, right?  So why are some so adamant to say that "homosexuality is wrong and we're all going to hell for it"  I just dont quite get that.  Isn't a sin a sin?     And another thing, why is it that a convicted murderer can get married?  A man who molested a child in his own family or an infant is allowed to marry?  A man who has divorced 5 times, that cheats on every wife he's had can get married?     Any insights on this would be great.     Just wondering if I'm the only one that wonders about these things?

So what if a person has made mistakes, perhaps killed someone or something of that extent, yet sincerely feels bad and amitts to his mistakes.... Is EVERYONE entitled to ask for forgiveness?? Is it a guarante? Can God say No, or do these "evil" people not even get to ask... bit of a weird question. But to add, dont u think even the atheists and the non believers will be bowing down and claiming to love God once the end of the world does happen, they ll lie through their teeth, some might even mean it, just so they could escape the horror and fears they so frivilously dismissed not to mention mocked here on earth.

20081024162909AAWjBKm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question to Christians (not Atheists, we already know your stance!)?	   And did Jesus really sacrifice himself, if he was to rise three days later and become the post powerful being in the universe? there have been people in concentration camps who have gone through more pain, and they don't get to be Kings of heaven, also, I have a relative who was a Ukranian seperatist in the Soviet days, and he got tortured more than Jesus did.      Why would god (in the form of Jesus) have to Sacrifice himself, for himself, in order to forgive the sins of the world?
20081006144852AA9m0yb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I have a friend...? Christians please answer?	My friend who does believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for his sins but he says he is not sure about whether there is a heaven or hell. He has asperger's so he thinks very literal and concrete so he has trouble contemplating something he doesn't know exists. He doesn't go to church or anything like that so he doesn't have the opportunity to learn about Gods Word.  Is it ok that he is not sure about heaven and hell.        Can some of you give me some scriptures and stuff like that in order to help him learn important things from the Word of God and possibly become a full believer in heaven and hell?

I am gay male, I'm closeted, or just in case someone doesn't get that term, means I haven't told people I'm gay.    I live in a very gay-unfriendly place, I don't mind staying in closet, I understand my own situation and have resolved to stay this way until I can manage somewhere else.   Here's my problem, I feel guilty lying about being gay, and hiding it. I don't understand why but I feel compelled to 'come out'.   Is there anyone who's had to stay closeted extended period of time?
20081223193017AAqRudG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why so little talk of Islam, Muslims?	Christianity takes a bashing on Y!Answers and yeah it has caused a TON of issues world wide in the past but the Muslim world seems to be directly at the center of many of today's conflicts yet there is very little talk of this in R & S. Is it because there are just so few Muslims to argue with, the fact that many of the Pagan/Atheist crowd was raised in some form of Christianity and now lashes out at them, or the fact that no one really wants to talk about what religions are actually shaping the world right now. I mean for what should be one of the most serious sections of this whole site there is an s'load of petty arguing and discussions about stupid ass3d muffins. Any thought on why it's this way??

Alright, it took a lot of thinking, and I finally came to the conclusion that I am Bisexual. I always thought it was just a way of getting attention, claiming that you are bisexual, but after doing a little research, it turns out that there is so much more to it! There are communities, flags, and even a day to celebrate this... so, what should I do? What should I learn? What are some communities I should join?   And probably the most important question- will I be accepted in the LGBT community? I heard they aren't very liked. I have a whole bunch of gay and lesbian friends, and I don't know how they would respond if I told them I was Bisexual.

20081009144915AAxOfIV	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do I deal with a neighbor?	 My wife and I are in our mid 20's and we have a 10 months old cocker spaniel who is fully house trained. I'm hardly ever home due to military duties and my wife work the night shift and she doesn't come home until just before dawn. Ever since we moved into this little apartment complex we were greeted by the other tenants except for one. This lady look like she was in her late 20's and always had that look that she didn't want anyone living in the unit directly behind her. I finally decided to post this when she called the police complaining that there's a noise disturbance coming from my apt. My wife had a couple of her co-workers over at around 2am and talked in a low settled voice in the living room. Our spaniel was laying on the couch beside my wife while she was chatting and didn't really do much. So the neighbor, being who she is, called the police and they told my wife she would be cited if they get a call like this again. The police asked my wife if she had the television on or if  the dog was barking, she said no to all, she was just talking with her friends. But wait it gets better, the police went to talk with the lady for a bit and came back to talk to my wife saying she heard barking, loud noises and decided to throw in that her ex-husband was a cop also. Sounds like something out of Lakeview Terrace, eh? I felt as if she was planning a plot to some how find the perfect excuse for my wife and I to get evicted. I wont let it stand because I have two other neighbors, one directly behind me and one who lives above that one to verified that they have not received any type of disturbance from my apt. The owner of the property already notified us about the complaint that were made to my wife and wanted to talk to her today about it. I wanted to know what action I should take without my family having to relocate. Keep in mind that she filed a couple of other complaint about my wife before but only to the property owners. Also here's a good one, the lady bedroom share the same wall to my living room, this is the same wall where I have my main couch and a school desk. I bet she would rather have my entertainment center on that wall rather than the couch, eh?

20081102010447AAnjMpz	Society & Culture;Holidays;Christmas	I have a terminally ill little girl & have fallen into a bad situation for Xmas. Does anyone know of any help?	 I am a mother of two children & I am in desperate need of assistance for Christmas. I was a bit hesitant to ask for help & especially this early. I felt that with Christmas being two months away, that something may turn my situation around but now I have waited to late to apply for help to most orgs and groups. We have always been blessed in the past & have never had to ask for help and honestly, I have been too humiliated to ask. I found out my little girl had a terminal illness a couple of years ago and things have become really bad this year. I was forced from my job to care for her & things went down hill from there. Living in a small area, there is no help other than food help. The larger city near us had toys for tots but it is over an hour away & I had waited too late for sign up. The last couple of years things began to look up for us so I never anticipated needing help. I feel embarrassed to ask for help. I don't want to go into my life story here so I will be as breif as possible. As I said, I was forced from my job unexpectedly when my little one was diagnosed as terminal. Things became really bad when my husband was diagnosed with a chronic disease (early parkinsons) & was forced from work himself. We have signed up for help with ss but he has been turned down due to age. Things became harder but I was picking up childcare & cleaning jobs that I could do with my daughter & trying to sell what I could on yahoo groups. Although barely, we were getting by. On top of this, we have had to travel often to doctors out of state which has really been hard. She has insurance to cover the medical portion, but we have to pay the gas & other expenses ourselves. We had managed to keep things up until April of this year & things started falling apart. I lost two of my cleaning jobs when the elderly ladies passed. I still have two but they don’t begin to cover things. Every cent I get goes towards our living expenses & when I have fell behnd, I have sold whatever I can to get by & not ask for help. I had hoped something would come along, but it has'nt & I don’t know what else to do. I am not lazy or someone who wants a hand out. I am so ashamed of asking but I don’t want my children being hurt because I can’t provide. We have always worked & provided with no help from anyone until all of this hit. I would get a loan to avoid asking for help but honestly, I have bad credit due to the past situations & loads of medical bills from all of my family. I know that it looks horrible. I don’t know of anything else at this point. I didn’t just count on posting for help & doing nothing to help myself. I have tried all else before humilating myself by asking for help. I would never be asking for help if I knew any other route. If anyone can suggest any groups out there or other help, I am open & desperate. I thank you so much for reading this & would deeply appreciate any thoughts or advice. I have searched all of the churches in the area and all other resources in our area but it is too late. I appreciate you taking the time to read. God bless you all & thanks. 
20081105160251AAlrNoG	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why can't people just get over this?	Yesterday I came out of the closet to Yahoo Answers and although I got some very supporting feedback when I checked my Email I saw that I had three messages from other members. All of them were hate mail saying things like I am not really gay and that I should convert to hetero otherwise I would be condemned to hell or you will die of aids. I even got a death threat  in the last one which I will not repeat on here.      First off I know very well that I am gay, I have had these feelings ever since I was nine and I had a crush on Lance Bass of the Nsync (who turned out to be gay) I have always had those feelings towards boys and they have only grown as I have matured. Now I know I am still sort of young at 17 but from my thoughts and experiences I believe I am just as crazy about boys as any straight teenage girl. I have been batlling with myself over this for the past years of my life, you don't know me, I know me, I know what I like and who I am.       Second off I have read the bible it preaches tolerance not hate I don't see how people can get such a hateful message to gays out of it. I am not asking for you to roll out the red carpet and welcome every gay guy with open arms when they come out of the closet but please if you don't have anything nice to say please just don't say anything. I don't see how me being gay hurts you in anyway.      So yeah why can't you just get over the fact that I like boys?

20081113151056AAMGxyr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	ADULTS ONLY-How to reject swingers? (they make me feel disgusting and extremely uncomfortable).?	   A few months ago, my bf and I went over to his co-workers house for what I though was an innocent barbeque. When we got to the house I had a REALLY bad vibe about the couple, like they were into something deviant or wier...it was just a really creepy feeling but I brushed it off as me being over sensitive. When I turned around to go outside I found the door had been locked behind me (my bf was outside with his supervisor) and thought that was wierd. I was locked in a room with the co-worker's wife. Although I thought it was wierd, I brushed it off b/c I though it was an accident and went and had a glass of wine with the guy's wife while we chatted. We were talking and then watched a movie and she began touching me...I didn't get what was going on until she got to my boobs and then I freaked out. I kinda had a slow reaction b/c of the wine, I still think she put some kind of drug in it. I didn't know what to do b/c her husb was my bf's supervisor and if I pissed these people off my bf could be fired. I tried to play alonmg and told her I was too drunk and had to go home. I'll never forget the way I felt - so dirty and disgusting, I wanted to take a thousand showers but felt like even that wouldn't be enough to get the filth off of me. I can still feel her disgusting hands onm me and it has had a huge affect on me. We never went back to their house and my bf stopped talking to that supervisor at work and was transferred. Now, a few months later I was at a luncheon today for a professional organization I belong to. As I was walking to my car, I noticed a couple was behind me. The guy rushed up to me and his tongue was practically hanging out of his mouth...he was so grossly hitting on me but then his gf came up and she was just as bad. I instantly got the same feeling about these people that they were also swingers and I felt disgusted. I got that same "slimy-nasty" vibe from them as I did the other couple (the same gut feeling I didn't listen to then). I was polite to the couple and finally they went away but I couldn't find my car in the parking garage and so they pulled up in their car (second approach) and asked me to get in and that they'd help me find my car. Again I had that same really bad feeling and so I told them I'd just found mine and then pretended to get a cell phone call. I walked to a stranger's car and acted like I was digging for my keys until they drove away. I was in tears by the time I got to my car. It brought back all the pain from a few months earlier. I am not into swinging, I don't know why these people approach me (other than I am very attractive- however, I do not flaunt it) and they make me feel disgusting. They make me want to shower their filth off of me...I don't know if that makes any sense. That night a few months ago, I felt as though I'd been assaulted by that guy's wife. I'll never forget that feeling and it's really hard to deal with, it has had an effect on my sex drive - now I never want to have sex w/ my bf. How do I firmly reject these people? I want them to leave me the hell alone! It's worse when it's a woman hitting on you. Has anyone had to deal with this before and how do I firmly reject these people? I am so angry that they would even do this, it's even worse to have to be polite. What should I do and how do I deal with this "disgusting" feeling? How do I stop feeling those hands on me from a few months ago? It makes me insane and has ruined my intimacy with my bf. I felt like I was raped. I wish these people would leave me alone forever! What should I do if I see this couple at the next meeting? I'm afraid that if I tell them to F*** off and that I think they are monsters that they'd spread rumors about me and try to ruin my professional reputation. At the same time, I am so angry and never want to see them again... How can I deal with what happened months ago (yes my bf knows) and how can I get strangers like the couple today to leave me alone? How do I tell them to F*** off in a firm way that they will understand but that isn't too rude?
